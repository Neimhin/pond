I family Pakistan India speak differences ground. know Pakistan decided join Anglosphere's hubris circlejerk; instead, ignored loud propaganda time masturbating China's imminent Chernobyl decided learn China's trial-and-error results. copied play-by-play wherever possible. That's conscious leadership decision.

Then people Pakistan. general population EVERYONE behaved - young old, white collar tradespeople, men women. people ground behaving properly? socially enforcing good practices? putting egos aside coming together neighbors usually hate others guts? mother-in-law less pain ass son-in-law son-in-law considerate past?

I hope maintain collaboration remain vigilant. certainly Viruses tend mutate less deadly. Deadliness isn’t great viruses’s perspective. Less deadly strains proliferate better, don’t kill host. Everyone decided virus went holiday. never socialise people enjoy isolating yourself, mean people enjoy it.

Most us look forward meeting family friends without restriction. keep saying joke world right now... Pray us people get vaccine resume normal lives matter happens anyone says. never going end unless criminalize refusal wear masks social distance. fact getting vaccine required refusal also resulting criminal charges. positivity rates rising due kinds densities? new normal wearing mast flu, Southern Hemisphere low flu rate now. worked teacher 3rd grade april till july raging on. mask, tried distancing kids impossible field trips packed busses.

No one got sick. case spike region, barely deaths. spike (which didnt increase deaths either) happened school holiday season.

You good. lock couples together hate beyond repair call success Well, article sensational piece blatantly frames clearly labeled ""discussion paper"" presented scientific study.

So guess bravo shining example purport disdain completely misrepresenting they're talking falsely incite anger fear readers. Yeah I’m fine that. I’m little risk complications virus. really risk people getting vaccinated would slightly worse getting myself.  Brace yourself, Winter coming.  Akshually it’s called trilby collection. I’m sure formidable. strongly disagree. behavior see around Korea, people capable wearing masks properly also maintaining social distancing. It’s matter either-or, it’s matter many small behaviors aggregate time.

Are masks perfect? course not. help lot. common thing say, really didn't. Osama's stated goal commit act would make US people realize foreign interventionist ways needed stop. Unfortunately didnt anticipate Americans dont critical thinking skills instead got countries invaded millions killed. winner US Imperial war machine got free pass 9/11 curtail freedoms home kill abroad sure link for, expect someone listen 52 minute podcast learn say particular thing, you? actually know is, curious, yeah spending much time it. back plenty people got polio knew someone died permanently f'ed up. rampant. That's exactly humanity acted millennia pandemics much lethal diseases. Many well meaning scientists seem forget history well. nothing. 

It’s similar mask rules airplanes, board plane, American Airlines case, literally hand bag bottled water crackers. encourages EVERYONE remove masks. 

I sat business class, drink service well. entire business class masks 25 minutes, longer. 

It’s mind boggling stupid everyone planet is. least know airlines shitty putting profits public health. hope kidding. I'm sometimes hypochondriac even beyond me. Fuckin man.

this revealed lot people. course. think C came from. /s sub changed (edit: better). Numerous comments mine pushing back anti-mask rhetoric constantly removed mods couple months ago. And, wonder anti-maskers felt defending? sentiment seemingly localized primarily America. Hmm. Guess we'll never know. already happened Spanish Flu pandemic. people anti-mask, pushed open back early. seems stupidity timeless, get smarter. Well politicians ultimately control set regulation. Fortunately single country control multinational companies abide regulations every country operate in. Excess deaths stat matters.

South Korea 300 official covid deaths 3000 reported excess deaths (how calculate excess, say). That's believe anyways, cannot find article sites detailed report, let alone raw data.

By way, past 52 weeks Sweden 3500 deaths compared five year average. previous 52 weeks negative 3400 excess deaths. 'dry tinder' (not phrase) effect seems explain almost entirely. ""It’s virus human contain.""

Magical thinking thinking know origins virus man made.

The truth *we know* origins.

When people believe conspiracy theories believing thing without enough evidence. 

I believe scientists generally trust institution I'm well aware times history corrupted. 

Really weird lab literally right wuhan. suspicious. can't say know something don't. That's conspiracy theorists, think know things can't possibly know.

I pretty agnostic virus's origins. tend believe scientists understand *could* conspiracy. Definitely possible. happened before.

I'm declaring know happened. okay say really suspicious know. run around telling everyone know TRUTH - probably don't. ""None above, fuck it, cut cord!"" everyone supporting herd immunity supporting wearing masks, right? /s actually decent amount incident evidence support something similar.  cookbook! COOOOK BOOOOOK!!! meanwhile political leaders British Columbia (Canada) mandatory masks. They’re complete jokes.  half government* FTFY GET OUT!! /jkg Absolutely. probability spreading less everyone wearing mask, probability goes masks come off. Asymptomatic mean can't spread it, affect *you.*

Edit: Right. Per below, said, *you obvious symptoms* lost 1.5 billion brain cells trying read this.. Actually, work, need masks **without** social distancing. example, attending football game everybody wearing mask. 

So banning sports events? Oh thank posting that. really something possibly hopeful You’re welcome! definitely consider Harvard trusted source. vet requiring masks, state, mandated vets require masks... attorney general declared counties decide whether enforce it, isn't. stupid, knows governor wants it, importantly, DOCTOR. 

&amp;#x200B;

So DOCTOR, believe wearing mask pandemic breathing spreads it. Yeah tough. stop taking pets feel safe me. idiots like gives us decent homeschoolers bad names everyone america soft? Everyone “does told” political leaders say so. people going actually take action?  Eurocoins increase size increase value (except iirc 1 euro coin little smaller 50 eurocent Soylent Green people point, say fuck it. I'd probably mind business assuming watch Fox? thing watch Fox Bob's Burgers bwahhahaha

Notice many downvotes got? one agrees Yep. used wake 530a leave 630 am, hour half commute, 9 hour day, hour half home. Now? wake 730am, work 8. Provided efficacy proven point, correct. dumb question know. yes, can. 

It's little less likely would spread infection asymptomatic (simply symptoms, like coughing, manifest virus-transmitting actions)...but definitely still contagious. tell left. People speak money also love cherry pick time frames. make sound like deadliest day. 

But no, it’s deadliest day two weeks. technically could reduction 99% month ago, don’t mention title. bring Boeing 737 hoax


Both things ridiculous hills die Paramedic 
Wear masks front patients (Most us anyway.. still get whole asymptomatic part...""Oh patient cardiac issues! covid.. take mask off!"") 


Don't wear masks station\\ambulance.. wear uniform calls.. patients end touching us, end arms hold keep still.. seem wear masks stores\\public.. (Not mandatory here.)  


Yeah, magical people think. won’t be. dystopian lizard/ape hybrid kicking I’m sure else sort interesting, hospitalizations near 30k approaching lowest since began. deaths probably follow downward trend too. is. Things feel dystopian right ADA, HIPAA. 

In defense bill, one said business would need give names. event occurred. 

This common sense bill needs passed ASAP. It’s deadliest pathogen 100 years. complete nonsense. Well, they're all...

Im sorry :( also make dick bigger. get scientific information facebook memes? since dime smaller nickel, maybe 20 cent coin smaller 5 cent coin... Ya, I'm certainly advocating anyone rush bar host house party... extremes crazy (i mean someone want go impacting them, ok, you) reasonable balance had. exactly looks like varies person place. Sorry loss. &lt;------ Here's link list masks efficiencies anyone wants info. I’m sorry. I’m California, sootstained skies, though joke immunity What's interesting everyone talks horrible second wave coming, often points example set Spanish Flu support this. severity second wave Spanish Flu driven mutation disease making lot deadly, spread widely war-related troop movements. far tell, there's evidence case covid. Obviously (major) war, virus seem likely mutate deadlier strain. 

Instead, ebbing flowing coronavirus we're witnessing due us tweaking freedom valve. Like said, restrictions ease up, people get careless, numbers go up. current situation Europe demonstrates perfectly. We're ourselves. sense, that's comforting, mean control it. hand, disturbing, seems we're intelligent stable enough society actually make use fact. everyone wears one, everyone benefits....soooo.... I'm enrolling one studies, said they're planning un-blinding around November. may mentioned vaccinating placebo group can't recall. mask thing really exposing idiots left right. Pay business owners close, alternatively businesses could innovate. Let bars sell takeout alcohol might enough survive. pay people stay home pay non essential businesses close month Covid could brought control. people would willing go economy could get going again. Even able open probably won’t successful environment. even 50 cent coin? know dollar coins. Well agenda slowly changing Trump purposefully downplaying it. read article above? It’s novel virus.

Would rather adjust new information?

Because pretend like it’s China, kills 3.4% get it, there’s human human transmission.

That’s insane right?

We roll info, sadly political media lens make tough right thing. Interesting article - Terrible headline. Black Lives Matter completely different subject discussed article. It’s least third leading cause death since March. Imagine cancer (all forms it) appearing nowhere starting kill number people per year currently does. would terrifying that’s exactly what’s happening right now. 
 
And combat specialty clinics US walks donations months devoted it.... agree, never ceases surprise though. Vitamin C large doses causes cancer. told please keep cause side room actually window facing outside!  said “you keep .. someone might walk make big deal it”

:) 

and i’m going write office thank service last 5 years, also tell disappointed :( one case hes wrong. March 2021 case counts low things get back normal. 

Vaccine immunity. Guinea Pig spreaders immunity. continued mask wearing get us Spring 2021 latest. 

The virus won’t able effectively spread anymore many people antibodies.  curiosity, anyone link actual paper? tried looking site, find link. blind dumb. Thanks advance. Totally Yea put 5-cent coin thinking US nickel noticed must Europe saw 20-cent coin option switched that. 

50-cent coin little bigger quarter think, maybe size.  We've known viral dose correlated severe disease months.

Back start whole mask debate arguing partial protection fact better protection, even exposed, viral dose mattered.

There whole lot anti-mask propaganda pushing idea masks perfect useless. counter argument perfect, cut transmission reduce number infections, reduce severity infections.

We may scientific proof, result people accurately arguing back like May, using information viral load corresponded severe disease. still think we're scientifically certain viral dose either, evidence still lining way makes sense start. mom lives Florida- FEEL YOU!! No. Excess deaths total. addition to. though? Last read 29 million work, that’s probably 15 percent work force I'm surprised bother wearing one think flu.  Reality blue agenda. Come man better this. Ah see you’ve gone *”they’re empathetic idiots”* defense. Maybe. Wife sepsis, septic shock . Hospital quickly admit first doc idiot said tell admitting nurse admit wife improved time saw her. crash people revived her. Mostly ok bad stuff leaves issues. can’t thank enough posting this. I’ve petrified son. teacher one supposed risky blood types. glad read trusted source. Makes sense anti vaxxers also hate wearing masks. Staying brand. It’s impossible come reasonable middle point. preference neither boyfriend would see friends ever. left friends’ influences he’d probably lot riskier things. We’ve met middle indoor events parties. Granted, took lot talking repeating science-backed points get there, it’s happy middle since uncertain beginning. may dumb question, say you’re asymptomatic wearing mask. Could still pass family? dunno, buddies uncle posted memes Facebook say otherwise Yeah logic reason strong suit  mah freedumb lol thats bullshit Well here's problem, know people Hubei, make unqualified speak ""truely"" happened.

Everyone knows way know truth, watch Fox News nothing else. anyone look 1929 2000 crashes note huge crash, awe-inspiring multi-month rally huge crash beginning September. That’s happens. Cloth masks aren’t entirely effective, sure, still lessen actual spread talking / coughing / etc. 

Pair social distancing hand washing you’ll eradicate disease time. fact Americans can’t even one simple thing incredibly telling.

Also, there’s “secret” property cloth masks made specifically give low doses thus build immunity, it’s literally consequence material. better world, everyone would high grade mask, however can’t spend fortune / don’t want take supplies healthcare personnel, cloth masks moderately sufficient.

#EDIT: wrong, apologies. Risk tolerance big flash point, too. There’s run mill money in-law tension, plus things mentioned... couples probably arguing activities safe, what’s acceptable, precautions take, making judgements based other’s opinion — that’s what’s tearing relationship right now, least. Kind blows mind much pandemic torn people apart way has. way. knew people would go crazy buying got online really early. gotten couple new designs also late.
I spent time abroad wear masks regularly imo useful work used properly. 
Also, bit outdoorsman think cautious prepared stupid.  Americans pretty awesome thoughtful too. Thousands thousands handmade masks sent New York caring people states .... Cuomo held press conference unveil enormous QUILT made masks . Hopefully Cuomo won’t charge food drives come thanksgiving . heard rumor wanted recreate theTitanic exactly scale full cans spaghetti O’s Pringle’s 0% chance would get thru congress even true Yep, closer 20-30% everyone NYC 10-20% NY State New Jersey. kinda strange started getting compliments mask go grocery store whatever. 
I keep feeling like international marshmallow test. Except can't wait believe marshmallow real ... also steal marshmallow set place fire. 
Of course, say good onus leadership... lack thereof. end July, 16% Mumbai infected, approximately 2 million people. virus definitely spread since then. stretch parts India large volume cases Secretary Education whose fortune comes selling makeup funding initial (astroturf) anti-mask movement helped too.

I wonder someone makes less money people wear less lipstick would anti-mask. western countries, per capita, experienced bad coronavirus outbreaks worse. Italy prime example. think effect coronavirus would Trump Trump. Putting mask around people hide discomfort often talked metaphorically literal mask face making feel comfortable makes perfect sense me. think mask folks also show good faith consideration strangers puts ease personally. article: “masking MIGHT reduce inoculum exposed person inhales. theory bears out, population-wide masking, type mask increases acceptability adherence,2 MIGHT contribute increasing proportion SARS-CoV-2 infections asymptomatic” 

I want say first foremost agree mandatory masking think positive impact reducing spread virus, healthcare worker treating COVID + pts, husband wife 38 weeks pregnant take virus vary seriously. said think article extremely reckless. Hypothesis! data support idea it’s provocative hypothesis, I’m concerned publishing cause harm good. It’s apparent comments people already feel emboldened idea, feel wearing mask (no mention physical distancing) could gain immunity. KNOW TRUE. 
This literally 3 step scientific process. 1.) observe 2.) research 3.) hypothesis 4.) TEST 5.) Analysis 6.) hypothesis correct? share results. 
This “article” literally hypothesis published prestigious medical journal given credence. Probably force us go back person two weeks. decided constant cleaning make people perceive school safe. got 2 pack ebay $16 waited 3 weeks. Still faster people could get one acted back February. people lack common sense waited CDV said ""okay! Guess should?"". dropped this: /s  Ever since started wearing masks allergies damn near nonexistent. fuck would want go back using box tissues week wear simple mask? way wait 72 hours 120,000 people get vaccinated real virus. lol Texas here, people wear mask walk bar (the ones serve 50% food able open) seated mask off. Seats pretty close, outdoor seating there's usually indoor seating too. pretty worrying. they're throwing fits 8 episode TV show released weekly instead bingeing (sp?) amazon, kind amazing. serious adversity encounter going squish like grapes Yeah, does.

If - else knew? Nobody, answer. Mmm live pustular matter 🤤 would explain sudden explosion many Karens. 

The Mask Vaccines *causing* massive spread autism! Nah rather opposite,everything reopening pretty optimistic think stupidity, ignorance, anti-science, indoctrination foreign concepts anytime soon Laughing harder suckers defiantly refuse wear mask. also spread mink several countries cull large amount mink farms. shocked many mink farmed fur still. feel sad feel need protect themselves, may get sick many others compromising? understand wanting protect people love. much cops can't put protests they're poor much they've probably told resist using lethal force openly election. everyone overspending beyond means. people come poor background don’t habit saving. people overspend. people huge debts student loans thought gonna pay job later.

HiGh ViRaL dOsE RiGhT! honest, magnitude asymtomatic spreaders known beggining. first thought started spreading virus symptons like respiratory viruses, mask helpful sense presented symptons shoulve stayed fuck home.    
At least thats intrepreted, obviously can't comment thought proccess public health experts.  

Policy change presented new evidence.  Apparently virus became ""extinct"" US 1952. Dad born 1951. I'm sure he'd happy know age still ""too young"" something. actually find exact number, number say surpassed August 26th. Johns Hopkins' site shows ~1300 9/11, assume that's got information they're talking about, kind forgot report story write headline. Strange things afoot Circle K. Absolutely true. Theyre coronaviruses, SARS-COV-2 mutate SARS-COV. could gather reading articles, share similar naming convention they're coronaviruses cause sudden acute respiratory issues. Well there's cliche America second world country Gucci belt. Biden did, least listened science Im one! work factory 80+ people literally mask wearer :( think issues. Mask culture really needs thing US. needs normal part appropriate apparel use. live predominantly Asian city almost every Asian person running errands masks on. leave city spot fewer people wearing masks. fact they're embarrassed wearing one come crazy excuses shame others really needs change. opinion

....

Is real life? Weird go centuries.. covering face times disease.

Almost like humans solved problem before.. forgotten.

One Big Tragic Comedy. 😆  What? giving smallpox vaccines 1972 movies. Lock Stock Two Smoking Barrels, Fight Club, John Malcovich, Three Kings. 1999 IMO peak. late 90s fun time music. also ‘you you’ attitude. Thank trying unbiased informative. 
So, immunity per se higher chance asymptomatic case? case wearing mask would help lessen chance unknowingly spreading it?  makes lot sense. Anti-maskers clearly fighting directly self-preservation now. homeless people sure. Check podcast. goes excessive fuck! Considering number noses I've seen hanging masks last six months, right. Maccine! Yet US asshole world terms Covid spread. want travel without mask, know I'm safe public spaces. gives crap. got shit done reaping benefits Seriously never heard this. Neither dad, age group. know... found kiss mark poopy butthole top covers Springhill Suites back.

Man, pissed off. Nov April going big strain humanity.  Herd immunity already basically reached places like NYC Sweden. took less 6 months. Theres zero reason take year rest country, especially vaccine. yeah, that's fearmongering. depends writes history books whether science prevails.    
    
This may Middle Ages plenty religious groups around world behave like is. like episode Cautionary Tales then. probably rest well. politics aside, fuck everything hes done dont even worry that. Listen motherfucker talk topic ""detail"" let know think he's even remotely intelligent polticians surround him. Guy fucking idiot partisan issue too, bragged acing test asked count, draw clock, point animal. Kamala Harris wanted $2000 Pandemic UBI per month us hope Joe Biden make happen. think win. Don’t worry, usually rub one blankets get good cleaning. 😊 can’t look total numbers, percent positives US whole way March. yes, raw data close March, we’re testing 4x day. like mine. wish would become standard. Flu season would better then. like anonymity mask. mouth words songs headset people can't tell. trouble back mom told go chiropractor went 20 years ago. trying get buy crystals stop 5G rays 5G reason back pinched nerve. complete fucking hack. Good thing information session actually anything. Never went back. (I pay btw). unable fucking lift legs trying fucking sell crystals... lol lived Japan stretch. 

When March rolled around c19 starting bump like, “Welp, time cover up.”

Didn’t think twice it. It’s do. yourself, neighbors. need shit information. done horrific way looking human lives. tipping point yet given China currently several million people concentration camps sample organ harvesting huge leap assume doses given consensually. 

Doing done ins mind set leads slavery, sex trafficking atrocities humans commit upon other. find bit irony praising totalitarian move like China invoke imagery Hitler trying bash view Trump's pandemic handling view personally.

Doing done led Timothy McVeigh bomb, knowingly, building full Children, Men Women. Led Osama Bin laden actions, Obama drone strike Middle East, Bush sign Patriot Act. . . list could go done trash going? 

Just fantastic virus low death rate we're fucking environment even before. fish birds eating, now.... Covid-infected pieces masks? Masks like iocane powder. wear one awhile build immunity. mean literally every airborne disease existed since masks existed greatly mitigated masks.

Reduced viral load exposure means takes longer viruses replicate dangerous levels within body, mean actually fighting infection gets dangerous body mount defense, literally early vaccines based on.

All certain political party would know paid attention anything written past 500 years disease. meant, children WOULDN'T. I'm reading right, saying COVID19 SARS-COV-2 spread children.

I meant ""Is precedent case children get infected spread infection?"".  IANAMD, would guess situation body producing virus, going spreader, whether carrier asymptomatic not. Lol. Never claimed I’m woke. trying share information neglected. And, quit traveling now. Yes, that's true also re-opened countries may explain rising cases lagging behind, particularly consensus seems outbreaks caused people gone abroad come back infected, definitely traceable people stepped flight Zante Cardiff infected outbreak around Sunderland traced back one individual also returned Greece infected.

I think 3,000 known cases indicates serious problem people displaying symptoms tested displaying symptoms can't bothered get tested. And, many people here, everywhere, rendering test trace feasible. Hospital admissions beginning creep too.

I've idea government going we're already recession damage full lock another months would astronomical.  hear nose signal Man/Man hookup action. I'm bit prepper tbh, already enough TP paper towels last next couple years. That's deals worked me. change. got infected dying start next weeks.... thing works sending sick kids home immediately. back 1918. vigilant. kind mask use allow small amount penetration,cloth? seems like n95 protective,right? Thank you. cypress hill much more. ... guys quarantining ""healthy""?

In Australia, anyone who's identified close contact existing case goes quarantine (Lived them, worked them, ate them, etc.) 2 weeks tested. state, everyone identified virus last week quarantine already. virus nowhere spread.

The one state unfortunately virus got away quarantined whole capital city.

Goddam guys, least try get control Could! Also could not! People would've still found excuse idiots Almost 200k dead US Covid. move hypothetical probable? risk getting even small amount it’s proven cause blood vessel / heart problems Manufacturers allowed make though. specifically told designs work. Pointless. Looking deaths hospitalisation ratio infected negligeable.

Its going increase kids school. 11 year old started secondary 638 kids. Theyre wearing masks hallways outside year bubbles maskless nearly 80 kids.

Reality need get it. Shield vulnerable, keep distancing facemasks get life cant afford another lockdown frankly, shouldnt locked first time. Since fatality rate 1%?  scientists. science changes. concerns answered agree, people economy. China prioritize people forcibly quarantining homes without food medical care. hard understand? Click links posted besides first one. Yeah cost like, what? 200k lives? dying every day.

That's deaths country total covid cases. Sorry, opinion piece get published academic journal? no, advice definitely changed time. normally problem time changing rapidly grifters readily built competing narrative that. public health need adapt modern social networking. can't rely small set newspapers getting word sequence. everything completely mashed together big ball truth hate matter scientist says take Chinese vaccines, ofcuz completely happy it. what's problem here? saying probably case back March...

This would explain people get infected enclosed spaces high initial viral loads got sicker.

also also said wear masks later. Sweden, much. think it’s fear. control afraid dying.

I agree fear underlying cause denial existence virus. conspiracy theories (the virus engineered Bill Gates, CCP, Illuminati, etc.) think people find easier villain blame accept nature sometimes throw something like us. upsets illusion we're charge. Break law limited specific manner government assures fine.  veterinarian myself, cannot understand people like this. Someone solid grasp virology, microbiology, disease process... let conspiracy social pressure dictate behavior instead education. infuriating see. 

Where live thankfully scarce cases, masks mandatory, ALWAYS wear one around elderly immune compromised, someone cold, cannot around animal I'm examining them. Yeah apparently corrupt career politician. epitamy swamp better solution.  Absolutely. said ""Masks help Healthcare workers, essential workers first responders need most. short. catch y'all stay home we'll pay you. soon production everything reopen. high risk segment population continue pay stay home learn effective treatments and/or get vaccine.""

The problem would admitting fault capitalist system neoliberal government left US unprepared. There's already prominent left movement rise US they'll willing covid-19 deaths giving left powerful material current system. really goes show fragile system is. Covid-19 starting upcoming depression may worse great depression given record breaking milestones US achieved putting similar, faster, pace great depression wear masks outside work. Everyone does.

San Diego County refuses list names even geographical area outbreaks occur, get vague category breakdown of: restaurant/bar, hotel/resort/spa, healthcare setting, salon, gym, grocery store, retail setting, business private residence.

It's informative all. Make one, need HK cotton fabric. pretty sure kiwis havent taken precautionary measures. Masks widely used New Zealand btw (: didn’t work me. I’ve working sickest Covid patients since March serology done late August. negative. pure insanity. Anything push narrative. long read. 

""Masks work"" easier disseminate. asymptomatic wearing mask. asymptomatic immune system overwhelmed presence virus. still infected contagious. goes infection.

you still get infected die covid even wearing mask. still spread even wearing mask. less likely things happen wearing mask one remembers first advice given started caring March use N95s Dr's needed? avoid masks entirely wait medical community aquire enough PPE first. already 100 pack basic blue cheapo masks use 3d printer resin anyway. dont think huge conspiracy whether wear all, people later latched 1 sound byte make political case. People always get full meaning speak know. wanted retroactive March April too, iirc. would sure nice, probably won’t happen. Who's blaming anyone? even make comment? Also, wrong you? close assuming sarcasm going day chance driving insane   false. projected multiple working vaccines end year. runny nose / congestion symptom covid? wake everyday seems go away day goes on. say? think they're also midst opioid epidemic? need drugs function dystopian society. aren’t that’s whole new infrastructure needs set up, you’d problem.

Decades ago warned government officials allowing Oregon’s forests grow unchecked proper management would result catastrophic wildfires.

While want blame global warming uptick catastrophic wildfires, Zybach said change forest management policies main reason Americans seeing return intense fires, particularly Pacific Northwest California millions acres protected forests stand.
“We knew exactly would happen walked away,” Zybach, experienced forester PhD environmental science, told Daily Caller News Foundation.
Zybach spent two decades reforestation contractor heading graduate school 1990s. Clinton administration 1994 introduced plan protect old growth trees spotted owls strictly limiting Ask scientist around globe one they’d rather take. You’ll get answer: one that’s actually scientifically vetted. SARS really nothing like Covid-19. far deadlier, much shorter incubation period produced severe symptoms girtually everyone it. Basically, got infected within couple days sick interactions others limited seeking care. spread around world efficiently essentially died own. 

With Covid-19 hand get infected take week two (or sometimes even longer) get sick. many people sickness mild might mistake cold allergies food poisoning. Many people symptoms all. still infect others. Frankly, soon started spreading person petson stopping virus spreading around globe.

Ironically, precisely superficial similarity SARS MERS made many complacent beginning. guess prove together wearing masks then. Yay! can't even imagine bad is. Vancouver smoke fires Oregon Washington air quality pretty bad Nobody knew  Except one suggested trivial they're already produced risk hundreds millions doses (as I've pointed least twice now), sticking fingers ears going 'can't produced can't hear nananana'. Please continue warn us things pharma companies governments already thought factored months ago, though, pointing utterly obvious gift American Australian Humans particular. Could qualifiers deaths covid? I'm glad people see wearing chin getting immunity. thought looked like dumbasses, know. stupid. refuse study past... read it. main tweeter (Prof Darrell Francis) *terrible* job explaining finds wrong statistical analysis original myocarditis release.

A tweeters seem nod heads something wrong, good explanation made (or linked to).

I'm statistician science degree I'm confident good explanation would make sense me.

So explain it, link something that's Twitter thread steps back little explains what's wrong paper context... incorrect imply people don’t consider flu concern? face masks distancing flu season would normalized years ago. average North American person absolutely accepts thousands flu deaths year normal occurance.  Well idiot charge CANNOT reason tell people need wear mask goes even mass gatherings masks distancing.. infuriating see guy encouraging cultists go way screw us over!! know wrote “society” Apple autocorrected Soviet. Maybe 4th quarter 2020 prediction. Lenin still looking good? Dude, fuck guy. I’d pissed. Yeah worldwide that's like 100 million people. Reading alot people giving thread. Lotta cares anymore million times easier make mask would help manufacture something wipe shit flushable.

Literally anyone could cut t-shirt make basic mask would HELP matters. let perfect enemy good sucks lot.

Also, idea need shitty disposable masks criminal. Yes, SURGEONS need new masks. Barbara going Tesco shop doesn't. Get good cloth masks, wash like underwear, stop polluting. think privilege leaking. people around world even western world including U.S disposable income splurge instant delivery medications. simply reality.

I'm sure service even exists countries; mean tell aches pain wait amazon delivery arrive days? US lockdown cluster implemented local (state county) level really enforced. neighbors parties lockdown. never mask mandate August still refuse follow. neighboring state meanwhile done almost nothing stop spread. can’t really contain infectious disease people whatever hell want. coronavirus affecting everyone. special.

Signed, Israeli. Exactly, asshats buying imagined shortage rest buying resulting actual shortage. It’s true life getting back People wearing masks 

So normal. compromise, between.   sarcastic. hoping last two lines would let people know that. made boomer meme boomers topic awhile back. like reading news masks acting inoculation sorts, theory back February. feel validated now. bad England. exactly trust anywhere living places. idiots going vacation summer playing lives. Hotels clean things this. going either! downhill since 9/11 definite contagiousness. still totally sure level people contagious, especially asymptomatically. could significantly lower viral loads people shown study also means chance contagion reduced too. needs research, course test positive isolate. would also like live fantasy mass production vaccines trivial idea mentioning issue stupid. again, reflect reality. quest win argument labeled primary issue commes vaccine non existent.

I see way - going eat / bars thing en-masse 100 years so. We're conditioned think that's fun. Right?  


Well, people that? fun, stay engaged?  Work, art, creative things. think nice get back basics, even kind forced.  new perspective what's important life. Automod keeps deleting response “purely political” garbage bot. don’t really know respond I’m talking politics first place. amount education teachers expected merely get feet door, sinful they're paid places. actually know teachers take summer off. work summer school supplement income, take continuing education courses pay pocket, courses required certain number hours per year keep jobs. work summer camps supplement income. spend summers looking curricula making materials use classrooms (that pay money) writing lesson plans reading IEPs special education students. (Everything last sentence completely unpaid hours, too- bill district hours spend things summer, and, did, district would laugh like crazy, they're getting paid things teachers expected do.)

I several teachers family, different states, addition educator myself. things universal among us all. close pubs? Keep shops open, allow takeaways, enforce masks. would work better Fucking DUHHHHHHHHHY  that’s case, need make clear article. Lol Truth, neither number acceptable fine multi-million dollar company. J.F.K conspiracy 

It's initial infection many person. liken conspiracy theory giant onion obsessiveness. Obsessive compulsives sit happily peeling layer layer find another deeper layer, get tear moan get sweaty injustice inhumanity going because...it's onion. travel countries require lot loopholes?

It takes single strand virus make sick. reduce load chance sickness goes down. Simple really. pretty common trend jobs people want give back help society. epitome places can't even operate without massive volunteer staff, continue exist people want help.

Because want it, they'll work less society show gratitude abuse it. 1442. september still explain people essential masks leadership top  India also relatively deaths per capita.

I’ve happily worn mask religiously since March it’s difficult doesn’t hurt anyone.
In fact chronic asthmatic I’ve hardly used inhalers since I’ve worn it.
I can’t believe people waste energy printing anti mask banners it’s ridiculous I’m embarrassed them. Selection bias enriches population less risk-adverse individuals.

My wife one outdoors restaurant outing since March, intentions going inside foreseeable future. think that's meat producers regulators' pockets? Best comparison makes stupidity really clear: nobody dies AIDS directly. People end dying disease immune system gone. logic AIDS would non-issue. cases higher level officials bureaucracies don’t give shit violating Hatch Act seems. Laws constitutions fun. like residents New Jersey New York whatever. 'letting' passive. die different sorts things, dying disease natural. 

actively going torturing/murdering innocent creature completely different.

alternative question: USA go foreign countries loot resources murdering citizens order Americans continue lives? might think issue climate change Oil peaking, occurring decades get worse 

torture/murder never justifiable. always involves speciesism/classism Like what? Going work? one drinks Budweiser outside US. Plenty countries shutdowns. spiking. US might handled

Surely really big discrepancy state cdc numbers, someone would found evidence now.   work UK want pay, can't pay?

Most U.S. jurisdictions mechanism recover criminal fines restitution. eventually go collections. people worn them, healthcare workers overburdened anyway... Yes deaths. anymore. think know herd immunity is. That's America though. Average pay may higher universal basic health care full health insurance coverage basically screwed.  Rage Machine eloquently stated, ""Fuck you, tell me.""  necessarily. wife locked house since Feb. I'm lucky work home.

That's definition ""long term."" A) I’m sick sub exists B) couldn’t handle reading even second 

But you’re 100% right. don’t believe bullets killed kids won’t believe virus invisible. Even y’all Covid denying Lockdown “Skeptics” 8,000 total flights. many jets per day vaccine factories fill ? Tough reason people believe earth flat. see horizon eyes, observe new elements appear 'approach' sightline extend gain elevation fly.

Having secret information special / smarter everyone else belonging group much important reality people.

They hold onto conspiracy till bitter end rather give special status they've awarded themselves. Conspirashits lol, are, September 2020, United States government claims covering deadly virus killed quarter million Americans mark leadership

It's funny Trump talking call Xi well, Chinese government telling people home aerosolized transmission early Feb, month Trump claimed China lied him... Turns US government told directly Xi, lied American people. Agreed really undermined response corona UK. good, trying underline insulting fines are... harm done. Like said jarring because, yeah, we've 10,000 articles posts mask-wearing effective/ineffective one completely different sort thing, little bit ""ineffective"" actually benefit.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah realize work China unpleasant America supposed best country earth. sorts comparisons accelerate race bottom. know woman works elementary school. special education aide. one teacher, two aides, dozen kids class. They've hybrid (some students person, Zoom) two weeks. One kid tested positive Friday. whole class needs quarantine, they'll remote two weeks. second time someone tested positive school forced class quarantine.

Bit background: school district staggered start dates. kids receiving in-person teaching special ed, everyone else remote learning. Tomorrow, general education elementary school kids start. couple weeks, middle school starts in-person learning. October, high school start in-person learning.

Once again, two positive tests two forced class-wide quarantines two weeks one school, less 10% staff students currently physical buildings. What's going happen 6000 students, 400 teachers, hundreds additional staff back in-person learning? going madness. Even older kids better things like keeping masks on, move around lot change classes every 50 minutes. Instead one teacher seeing 10-30 kids per day, middle high school teachers need think 150+ kids, whether ever direct contact kid test positive. going nuts. parents insist want kids learn person, school board insisting school held person. 

Like said, kids sent home every couple weeks anyway due outbreaks. go hassle trying coordinate coming back school all? Remote learning thing makes sense. Oh I’m sorry :( Absolutely agreed. :(( politicians want change ""expert advice"" getting. guess dont understand logical level. take actual flames. burn food stove, thats bad. burn whole kitchen, surely worse.

Myself, I've voluntarily mostly isolated far. past week I've times. Seems rentree (back school) triggered ""back usual"". Normal activities resumed. times out, scared crap me. Even people masks on, exemption tables restaurants, really far apart enough, people move smoke not, without masks, masks nose/chin. People know (colleagues, visiting families, friends) sit bare face together, like that, why? Eating acquaintances make us immune? 
It's surprise France getting high case number. conspiracy nonsense seep starting worry me. 
I want escape plan another planet ready yet.

I'm NYC trust 90% wear mask. people openly shame others don't. also tend carry extra mask enter establishment's give help people. assholes. stupid.
The lockdown taught us give fuck. Lol
Sorry French. agree socialising normal. However, different ways socialise. person's socialising becomes another person's death sentence - well know put verdict. 

House parties non-essential happen time. 18 whatever age cap time - well sucks, everyone bear different cross. mine party bit, cross would bearable. Nothing check, mate. vegans know aware vaccines necessary evil. Unavoidable want keep communities safe. Capitalism finest.

Viral load can't build much outside large stores , especially people mostly going out. bar restaurant someone infected comes in, hangs , go sit, eat drink . going get infected, masks can't help need eat drink. simple, thats bars restaurants worst. Classroom, gyms salons mostly fall category also. viral load would explained better , people would care. spending. extra. know people South Carolina spending extra partying. denial. president tell social distancing masks suck, listen. know 37 year old healthy guy vent week february. worry covid I'm old.   Also Vet assumed liked (you appeared like return) obviously also shared beliefs convictions. 

""I like her, hippie things common.....Mask people stupid I'm certainly stupid, like stupid people, must mask person, too."" Meanwhile, made assumption her! dunno point here, think interesting situation! Yes. think death counts pretty close 100 percent accurate. Anything involves revenue, tend get really good counting. can’t collect taxes dead people quite good keeping track alive dead. Wot gunna do, wot gunna do?... oh shit.  never 19 think act like adults. hypothetical removed 40 years? mean, know many times hearts, brains, lungs shredded re-assembled 3 - 4 weeks 3 - 4 week recovery period .75 times per 52 weeks continually can't repair anymore, hope 40 cycles least. neighborhood they've transformed sidewalks streets outdoor seating, 90% people well within 6 feet friends (and often strangers) wearing mask (because food/drink). honestly get it. virtual friend lunch still support businesses takeout/delivery. like think going restaurants pubs necessity. absolutely restricted throwing parties safe so.

The rule six says meet 5 friends time, socialising?  telling almost 400 Mn cases? That's 1 every 3 people India. sure undetected cases 80x? That's stretch maybe. least young bankruptcy time 30 lol ironic trump snowflake saying this. worth, I've read asthma comorbity. sure would symptoms harder deal with, relief nonetheless bc partner bad asthma. said, elder person needs worried covid. really terrible wording.

Yeah right definetly reading two different articles.With cherry picking article create own.

Edit:And coincidentally,a 7 year old died Corona work City(Bengaluru) today.You wanna know sad part?He discharged hospital next day,so could added already highly inflated recovery numbers(pretty much sums situation India nowadays).He died day discharged. Officially 900K deaths second. Almost 3/4 year gone since start spread. humans know. hypothesis prove year humans dumb shit. takes hard work painful experience smart (learn mistakes).

&amp;#x200B;

Personal exp; warn family february, May got infected, one died. still care. eyes bad luck. people know fairly good. buddy lab manager different state. know health care workers.  lot neighbors people work worst. people houses never stopped bunch people over.  neighbor came recently petition ""open everything up"".  bought foreclosure years ago. stay home work it, equity goes way up.  travel later. daughter me?

This exactly happened me, CNA working nursing home, whole rounds tests, fine after. Self quarantined made full recovery. 
There's rule six. That's pretty clearly law socialising.

Regarding point, everyone likes parties maybe? every young person wants party managing restrain themselves. But, lot young people like holding attending parties. prevented indefinitely virus likely deadly them. Well USA least could 

Or **not**. Point can't take numbers make conclusions; find percentage actually spend. stingy spend matter rich. Irresponsible use word immunity headline, hypothesis. Thanks linking I've lucky flu symptoms all.  think accurate count deaths even years excess death? They're really fudging anything. know capability monitor population huge.  can't stop evil people evil, enforce laws punish get caught. called deterrent.

You stop young people behaving like young people, massive fine serve warning others. common viral infections, including common cold:

(Pretty much Europe diverse degrees, country know better month ago). 19, adult. article terribly flawed. thing right pandemics cause recessions untempered covid 19 pandemic would damage economy. Problem one really saying otherwise. created big strawman constructs article about.

What glaringly fails article provide historical comparisons pandemics respective economic damage. leaves punches big hole argument demonstrates majority economic downturn attributable lockdowns. Six weeks ago so, virtual interview RI’s Governor, Dr Fauci said thought we’d pretty much summer 2021.

Recently, he’s saying end 2021. 😣

What caused revise timeline, knows. Maybe misspoke said Summer 2021, thought better it. something happened subsequently.

Either way, get discouragement. I’m high-risk staying home basically since Feb. 

From I’ve reading recently, high-risk people won’t able go movies safely 70% US vaccinated vaccine that’s ***at least*** 50% effective. I’ll probably wear mask go movies opening weekends, popular times. 

I would venture there’s vaccine I’ve vaccinated, I’d stay masked go anywhere even small crowds indoors.

I find way see living way “sacrificing another 1-2 years life.” way look it, beats alternative impaired health, life all. used love conspiracy theories. didn’t believe them, loved intricate stories, mystery, etc. won’t anything become connected harmful thinking. Democrats care people money? chance pass universal healthcare....they instead let large insurance companies write new law pass made companies millions mandated everyone use companies. parties care different companies, make mistake parties boil money. IDEA many deaths have. real idea population even is. People severely overestimate capabilities Government India. extremely limited resources 8% population pays taxes. We’ve lost loved ones 99.9% us didn’t expect world stand still year passed. funny mention that. co-worker told day she'd done Christmas shopping already. marveled notion told shopping year holidays.  understand. wife's cousin family awful 24 hour/Black Friday shopping idiots.

This jackass undoing precautions taken others, hopefully fine teach lesson money. Honesty attribute self-selects population politicians. less likely successful honest one Good.

I think last fine sort thing, frankly hope way learn. 

Although coming back numbers going way Universities remote moment. Elvis isn’t dead, went home. - Men Black I'm sorry friend. think Fauci deliberately misleading public, much preventing harmful excessive panic, mask opinion.

A lot people justified changing opinion masks claiming ""we know enough virus implement mask policy"". reality obvious. fact, mandated masks *much* earlier (I'm talking February-March early), could potentially staved full-blown lockdowns many places.  Well, duh. No, perfect, Golden country greenhouse emissions, perfect government, free discrimination among highly enlightened citizenry? shangri-la research utopia gives right judge create wholesale bull shit measure with?  Please let know work influencing US like idealistic, perfect country. Go get clue, ignorant sheeple. Man don’t get someone could believe this. Pretty much counterfactual. called Xennials wish could raise collective consciousness country point everyone decides longer want live (or die) like this. Profit become god. human species fine thousands years life expectancy like 40 years, no, end, cancel pension plans... I'll agree masks necessary less developed societies distancing cannot achieved, e.g. much India, Africa apparently US.

The long term solution (as I've hinted since first post) work towards better society basic (European?) levels welfare. US lacks ridiculous given wealth. Apparently China ~15% GDP/capita easily able deliver medicines food everyone. many people know. Plus really shit mask 100 years back. 
It can’t compare today’s n95 simple surgical mask. reason put one. Dumb people always dumb though. specific part accurate? Sommerset decision never happened? Dunsmore never issued proclamation? South notice England moving towards abolitionism? saying ""fake news!""  It’s even co-morbidities people think dangerous. Like, overweight obese give worse medical outcomes general. I'll check out. Hell, people already numb. Almost everyone know acting like COVID already gone go back normal lives. There's law saying can't socialise.
Lots people found different ways socialise pandemic varying levels risk.

Everyone else wearing correctly? wearing masks all? (Can’t tell tone serious mocking.) tia It’s normal people get caffeine headaches go caffeine. “Fully grown adult” social term.

It absolutely is, terms discussing discussing it. Also, schools important, we're going make sure they're well ventilated adequately funded, right?

""Sure, go ahead, find money. Good luck bond though, I'll vote every basically schools need open cheap, bare bones daycare parents go back work, got it. I'd respect said that, instead pretending give fuck kids. lot more, bit more.

Right. sports crowd. say like is: ""I like sports much I'm willing risk everyone's health it."" lie say make safe, even true (which isn't), plan anything say anyway. first one standing line Home Depot mask get cottage fixed party summer. admit self-absorbed person care anything except immediate gratification. might think trash-person (and are), least liar. Although collection polls collated May, data curve updated ongoing basis.

I think reason intuition touch data successful smear campaign American people shift blame actual parties blame, people. Many days feel ya there. Hahahahaha dumb inbred hicks Black death bacterial viral. need vaccine easily treated antibiotics.

Edit: typo obviously hospital beds ventilators **must** used!

(do people extra hole heads?) meant North Dakota guessing. said ND people squares personality state based lived 18 years MonDak area. impossible shut world restart. would kill people coronavirus ever could. could wrong feel vast majority people value human life animal life. Goes back weird situations would ask friends comes save falling cliff let die.

Majority people choose human. I'm vegan naaa man, hot take, ways. needs concent even criminal's. median salary physician U.S. nearly $200,000, last time checked AMA still mounting opposition single-payer healthcare. So, I'm sorry, I'm little trouble feeling bad US physicians general. let us point No! also told mock people take even basic precautions. No, would highly recommend option. Lol No, soon Taiwan opens borders virus spread happily among masses absolutely zero immunity. 

Now, could easily suggest follow Sweden’s plans. However, science, single case (one country) prove causation correlation own. would need see majority countries following particular method great success. don’t see this. Results methods map. first half comment seems reasonable, don’t know till know second sentence... viruses pick... times compare vaccine...  Take go, tip like eating in. That's I've since march continue over. Mine definitely allergies. hate time year much. zyrtec live horrible life freezes. sniffles cough something live constantly wonder. America! everything Bigger, Stronger, Faster - including fall empire. Titles only. Uh, MultiMidden aspect misinformation conspiracy theories mistaken truth. huge problem here. always see people say don’t ever need run several places want take put new one? minutes away keep otherwise take off, use hand sanitizer get new one next place.  take away right vote aren’t biologically capable following laws. Can’t one other. Without entire Country stable place **X** industry locked down.

X = Fill Whatever Want Here. Spain already second lockdowns, national one. play-by-play news Astra Zeneca companies supposed ~financial~ news medical news. really shouldn’t treated daily updates vaccine horse race; it’s way far normies discussing details amongst themselves.

If particular vaccine doesn’t work might good news end; there’s way knowing. all... imagine kids countries mattered much ours. 
The headline 8k defenseless children dumped foreign country recourse. health care worker, I’ll gladly giving vaccine first round! 

It’s always cool first one something new, context! Lol ""Duh"" expect get pushing voting base get infected?

They care election. Presidents come go. Russian influence directed causing mass-disruption loss confidence US government. someone control President, fine; someone control President, better. Either way, plan remains same: maximum chaos. state (NM) mask mandate implemented around time (hard find exact dates) Germany, good compliance. 

Minus sovereign reservation (Navajo Nation), enforce mandate, exceedingly well, thank you. much. That's without help federal government, sandwiched two hot spots like vacation here, meaning 25% cases travel related -- coming outside state. So, yes, states particularly federal government shit show. Hopefully change soon. dont think slaves anymore Yea urge everyone look videos test animals treated. 

Just one example, find deadly dose new chemical. guess give range doses monkeys onses die. sad... hope end soon possible. Went restaurants since covid maybe four times movies. felt safe, kept mask stayed friends fam away people. still live normal life take extra precautions two Dakotas actually different story talks South Dakota. Republican governors. ton similarities beyond that. despite certain media channels portray, students nearly likely suffer complications COVID-19 teachers.  Oh, absolutely correct numbers March April way lower reality.

Also, people seem exhausted situation, mentally speaking. harsh lockdown lasted months, we're seeing infection rate skyrocket feel like people angry scared, especially government inability properly slow down.

For moment, looks like despite number infections growing non-stop, hospital capacity still death rate seem exponentially rising like infections, already month, there's probably many reasons younger demography infected people, treatment improvements since know virus months ago, also fact hospitals overloaded now. smart, really feel bad older folks legitimate health problems (breathing, etc) caused cold weather. gramma, still us, would spend summers Pennsylvania family spend winters Florida specifically warmer weather better emphysema. hope there's sort medical intervention help folks ride winter.

On aside, Florida's economy tank even more. Good job, DeSantis, fucking nitwit - yourself. care random person thinks?  I've wearing mask public since April. area anti mask one elderly even stopped too. 25% most. 

That event talked work tomorrow? literally ZERO masks. 

Fortunately go near anyone. lucky dont interact dont want to. I've already told many customers wearing mask need distance them. blaming young popular right referring teenager get clicks. do?

You stop going eat restaurants. good habits general problem dining-in fundamentally incompatible COVID safety measures. low-risk activity many people seem think is.

Normally I'd rattle reasons dine-in driving numbers up, think need here. think issue ignorance, emotional exhaustion dealing shit 6 damn months. year's grinding too, COVID going away anytime soon, flu season's around corner. death toll rise lockdowns return winter people stop taking unnecessary risks like going restaurants.

Complacency killing people. part solution. Order take-out. you’re gathering exclusively people live that’s violation. start inviting people outside household rules start vary depending country you’re in, eg. whether children count towards limit, limit number different households represented, etc.

Larger population, US perspective, borrie J came changed man ICU. seem heads straighter colonies probably go collections tank credit score. High risk blood types? East Tennessee mandates. pay attention them... Yeah people sub clearly don’t ever take risks. don’t want eat stay home. really think get rid Trump goes back normal, we're going back again. fix deeper systemic problems country nothing going change. equivalent heart attack, doctors manage get restarted, keep smoking, drinking eating pizza. get joke, buuuut, monkeys already intelligence. r/Coronavirus, people read articles around here.  prediction never vaccine, we'll learn live virus. never vaccine Black Death, learned live it. North Dallas here.. go two stores today. saw one tough guy mask pulled neck.  Around here, people taking seriously. exactly feel masks (maybe I'm overly sensitive excess CO2.)

Meat lacking plants already received federal exemption liability. Remember trump signed order keep meat packing plants open? Go read it. Seems oddly convenient, vaccine vaccine propose places it’s zero months winter? wife's immuno compromised

I am. Thankfully, I'm pretty sure back mid-February. still want again. shitty.

What fascinating know go doctor anything thaaat differently. completely useless work week slamming coffee energy write proposal, utter exhaustion. fear. felt like shit.

I felt like multiple broken ribs. Every breath hurt. took shallow breaths normal deep breaths hurt much. hurt rotate body all. I'd go rock gym worst climbing sessions. Rather normal 1.5-2 hours 2-3x/week, dropped back ~45 minutes 1x/week lot rest. taking pain killers help chest pain nothing. long prior I'd recovered two broken feet pain killers worked that. Whenever rolled sleep, I'd wake kid, parents school say go back, fucked. That's got breed serious resentment.

Very true...

My boss informed us we're essential tried motivational speech hour everyone else (I dropped office grab something). Uhh...I give shit we're essential. work home.

I get wanted us working home probably less productive. problem though there's pandemic literally can't get anything done I'm freaking out. pre-pandemic work work vs. pre-pandemic work home. people bail. Yes feel free hide bed years. real world know long term effects similar coronaviruses. mean.. That's reassuring me. know be. goal restrictions flatten curve. curve flattened. Mate... fucking pandemic... he'd choice either to... chose possible consequence spreading virus even kill somebody... chose anyway pays consequences, that's all, feel bad him, he's 19 mature enough understand things Thank elaborating nice hear full response.

Do deadwood approach apply children adults compromised immune systems? 

In regard age according US CDC breaks something like this:
75 = 101,323
25-74 = 74,162
There lot ways analyze it, one interesting fact yo break gender. Lots men women dying 25-74 bracket. Probably life expectancy general 80 crowd. still see pretty good percentage people dying would 20-30 years decent living ahead them. Lot's people lost children, parents grandparents illness, friends family among them.

I sure history reading, humans always taken measures avoid plague pandemics. difference know work. Humans almost always tried prevent death due illness. Even old testament bible recommends quarantine, isolation covering mouth prevent spread disease.

I agree exaggeration attempting hide homes years. think anyone proposing that. think lot wiggle room partying bars mass gatherings. economy relies heavily foreign tourism. won’t replace that.  losing good ones too.

My Mom needed teach decade. likes it. Guess decided hang hat up? Even don’t execute people, innocent people gonna jail life anyway I’m sure that’s better. drug charges earn life imprisonments El Chapo type drug dealing. Simply caught weed misdemeanor. near enough keep places open high rent rely bar service. Redditors would replied ""No, that's problem!""

I think lot people hesitant lend loved ones money fear becomes ongoing thing. lend people money, always inevitably end feeling used. I've ended friendships people start asking often hitting need something. ruin relationships. It’s like advocating universal healthcare except people behavior find risky personally. 

People may disagree naive, even stupid point creating risk place rules &amp; restrictions around actions (like mandating masks) someone starts talking death / lack care, it’s pretty clear actually evil one. 100% agree. Well said. Thanks sharing that. appreciate response. interesting herd immunity test case, Dakotas reasonably (as much continental U.S. gets) isolated small populations. Let's see high numbers get. bet level 20,000 total tested cases, current pace 10 days. cherry-picking article stats demanding equivocation? statistically improbable, statistically possible everyone statistician barrier entry asserting statistician. Statistically speaking.  would teachers students vaccinated separately? understand teachers liable become vectors, what's point students gonna vaccinated either? want attend school without majority population vaccinated... “Fully grown adult” social term. It’s biological one ability make sound rational decisions accurately weigh pros cons doesn’t fully develop well past 19.  Even though aware this, still understand feds Trump blocking ppe stealing it. Why? know exact valid ( hahaha) reason? Wtaf doors. Active shooter defenses lock them. Every time see CFR think framerates. taboo simply look genetics playing role? Let science decide race factor IMO, things could learned process, perhaps treatments future pandemics. even bad.

My university suspended 36 students welcome week (the week first week classes) going house party somewhere off-campus. sure received refund Fall semester. That’s 100% false. Air travel allows essential travel people turned back Fauci immunologist, public policy expert. society became personal canvas? I’ve gone indoors eat . terrifying first put food mouth felt normal . 

Everyone try . It’s new Bungee jumping sky diving ! anti-maskers action affected them, id like fine, whatever, choice, let natural selection take course.

But masks predominantly protect others yourself, anti-makers actions putting others danger. Natural selection collateral kool aid mentality. worries, country like Germany/France/Spain etc. , second lockdown happen. way. long hospitals overrun hundreds people dying day, lockdown. going take pretend measures let disease run population. Thanks correction, reply little sloppy. Im trying too, know kids ready harvest? Wow. Hydroxycloriquine real zombie virus. won’t die. can't blockbuster unless fill theaters. Unsurprisingly film studios want potential blockbuster look like total flop released covid19. assume looking alternative ways make enough profit films.  Well, it’s entirely fair blame president... elected likely refuse wear mask  experience pretty terrible movie back 90s.

5/10 would probably again.

I've often wondered movie theaters can't rent college lecture halls morning, church Sunday, perhaps even family groups sporting events. seems like one would pay per theater per 2 hour block would get movies right    assume way teach politics *You know rules, I* I'm gonna agree guy said illiterate.  lease are, can't evict her. lease. get removed property right on, that's quite thing eviction.

Also, one letting live there...

Source: landlord Agreed. already know masks don’t offer protection people think. Many sub truly believes game changer many countries shown not.  Czech, exponential growth another facemask mandate now. Whats future, knows. Another hard lockdown possibility. europe moment. grab everyone throat, infection slows. let people move on, speeds up.

We aint going nowhere herd immunity achieved. Naturally lets hope vaccine. doesnt change shit that. realistic view pandemic ends sufficient vaccine saturation. Facemasks, lockdowns, social distancing... nothing effect vaccine developement deployment. Awesome healthcare system here.  specific coronavirus also fairly stable contrary popular belief creating new stable strains, creating new clades original SARS-CoV-2 far know Clade L, predecessor Clade caused Wuhan outbreak. Clades G, GR, GS dominant ones again, quite stable. 

Yes, coronavirus relatively stable yes people overuse strain, probably two virus optimized human spread, next step ""lifespans"" RNA viruses downward mutation killing host optimal. Thus RNA viruses usually deleterious nature.

There general trend viruses less lethal time see many viruses naturally occur reservoir species, mean safely predict likely happen here. occurs evolutionary time scales, can't count occurring next year even short virus generation time mutating much quicker dead ended itself.

What rate mutation SARS vs SARS-CoV-2? much higher mutate much rapidly novel coronavirus rearranging create new strains new strains displace seasonal strain. seeing near kind rapid mutation SARS-CoV-2.

it mutates 4 times rate coronavirus iirc, right coronavirus antigenic shift. Much viral dose.

If get small viral dose body fights off, I'm asymptomatic spreading low dose, done I'm immune months.

Rinse wash repeat everyone wearing masks vaccine virus dies off. DMV isn’t taking new appointments, can’t drive it’s registered. 

The Florida DMV let people online? ridiculous. isn’t even first time Boris done this. Mayor London banned drinking tube. lot people didn’t even realise could drink tube point massive underground tube party weekend ban came effect. It’s like purpose. addition mortality rate would nice could cut length hospital stays, permanent long-term effects ideally perhaps number days infected person contagious. would also big impacts want here. Nothing living ex sounds fun. yes absolutely would evict her. virus deniers ruined thread. Theaters open fucking dumb. Why? Release streaming. can’t say 26 year old self, even 18 know better throw party pandemic.  disagree statement ""teachers job remotely""? Kids learn online, people time dedicated schools/courses online well COVID oh pete's sakes. 

""they go 1 2! wave waves inevitable matter do!""

Blocking now. honesty, ability admit say something incorrect. Goodbye. ""Success far"" key phrase... could wear duck head weeks rightfully claim covid protection method successful -- wasn't. see anything actually make successful prevalence cases grow. seem bare minimum, hand sanitization slightly useful, breaking smaller groups using separate bathrooms, etc. slow spread bit, certainly stop it. feel like people selling false message here, suggesting Danes hit upon fantastic approach re-opening. post? Right, exactly. Make sure give grandma extra good-bye year... 6%?? 

Try closer 0.2%. 

This information readily available, please least educate basics. Google COVID IFR fun. want get fancy, look IFR age. 

But 6% number says literally grasp facts. power evict tenant. talk landlord that.

Also, could let stay long wanted, long landlord care. disagree, infectious longer period 0.75% fatality rate instead 0.5%, using figures, could still spread far, kill many. Demand high positions cut lack taxes simple version ""Once vaccinated"" Plus whatever time-delay vaccine take effect.

If vaccinated risk. Oh no! Whatever do? contribute economy eating Applebee's getting prescriptions Costco? clog highways dodge minivans driving 20 mph slower everyone else? We'll miss Canadians. safe ever come back. cinemas mostly empty moviegoers go free will?

I heard stories people person large cinema room, nobody else went. already studies usage masks Ebola. shown dramatically reduce infection rates long everyone wore masks.  supposed distance schools Sweden too, honest one 20 ever it. masks either. 

Still, one month schools open autumn semester trend covid steadily downwards. here. inside dining me. Take patio only. I’m gonna stop talking since know Reddit accept opinion. Looks like Milwaukee getting hit hardest, maybe that's true normalized population. Excellent post Well, see, hoax can't make ya sick. /s upper middle class done way bush tax regulations. middle class gets taxed like rich. excessive. co worker Joy one them. devastating one cares. Gotta begin with... h excludes majority two care.  like apartment, leave anytime want. sign lease move, I'd evict her, I'm shit. Cuz ICU stays put ventilator nbd took calculated risk, forgot bad Maths  least wear masks whole time. going dine in, mask come point. Yeah lot people realize this. sampling method adequately random, sample large. case. deadly, less opportunity infect hosts. already see SARS MERS suppression actually good policy. protecting actually vulnerable instead?

It's kinda tough isolate everyone 50 everyone 50.  Yes, Godot ... seems like everyday meeting pushed off. remember almost nothing said French phonetically spelled English, didn’t think name though. Yep, Bucs vs Saints.    thing need studios RELEASE movies.

who wants gimped box office?  11 years NY district. make 6 figures would heartbeat. feel compensated imagine working anything less. Bad reading, 2nd national lockdown...... Damn think power heating bills would saved didnt need heat schools winter  roh reddit fatalists Hydroxycloroquine back menu Good luck opening up. alternative question USA going abroad looting nothing vaccines/ coronavirus. can’t even tell arguing since 3+ people debating saying message. Bless heart general rule thumb yes, preclude possibility deadlier infection evolution Exactly. lives miserable beyond repair. need false reality keep going going go may take us long return pre-pandemic levels, people begin returning soon feel comfortable vary person-to-person.

&amp;#x200B;

studios like ""person person"" variance.. could less money opening weekend. Eh, get you’re saying, think there’s something said donning mask touching taking totally done w errands. 
I put mask going first shop go to. leave errands, Walmart, dispensary, natural grocer coffee shop drive through. take driving home. Hand santizer errands mask stays on. Hand sanitizer removing mask placing ina paper sack.     course stuff. Educating children matters, outcome effort.   Cruelty nature. Watch call virus ""sweep through"" nation, killing sickening. make things convenient them.

They selfish, greedy, cruel. visible now. La ligne Maginot est franchit! Capitulation? That's happens millions lose jobs government refuses extend unemployment benefits recurring stimulus checks. Well, want take thought process extreme: cull entire elderly at-risk population (we can't asthmatic obese young people ruining fun kids, right?) nobody dies COVID anymore restrictions lifted?

Because that's exactly slippery slope suggesting. got shame? tourist, lives Garmisch. pathetic brain dead introverted shut would consider current state affairs normal. rejoin society, conform shut wet dream forever. though? family lawyer quoted explicitly said lockdown compounded issues marriage beforehand. course it’s marriages issues before, situation exposed issues exist, presented challenge relationships didn’t issues. Isn’t better find things aren’t going work sooner rather later? Really depends live. still indoor dining city. Indoor outdoor bars closed. Gyms still mostly closed. indoor malls open. playgrounds still taped off. 80% friends still full-time work home won’t going back office end Q1 2021. Jesus get head ass 2-months lockdown papers go grocery shopping really worked, it? co-morbidities?

And people like try reinforce ""Any co-morbidities?""

We need help. You’re acting like people won’t want see family thanksgiving/Christmas. December going bad there’s vaccine. Cruises infestation waiting happen Coronavirus. understand anyone wants take cruise. One person bad communicable disease, norovirus usually, everyone else ship gets sick stuck sea days. I'd get money back buy party boat instead go lake. I'm dazzled anyone swear buffets permanently.  Oooh, one week hit 200,000 deaths, everyone! exactly I'd expect I've observed: 

**People want believe want believe without evidence, believe want believe without evidence.** 

Most people want wear mask sake wearing mask. understand scientific evidence presented us help protect us transmitting virus others lesser extent receiving virus others.

But want wear mask, believe want believe complete disregard science experts field, simply believe masks needed effective, allows justify wearing mask. Hell, believe ""medical condition"" fairy tales law it.

The people want believe man made seem want because, wants believe stuff chaotically happens nature understanding? Nature scary. desirable people believe man made, big deal (just flu, something happens *others*), maybe extend conspiracy believe plandemic designed chip us BS,  wonder changed infections rising Europe. Maybe weather?  know support, welcome downvotes. I'm absolutely keeping mine on. vaccines give perfect immunity, year shown harmless wearing mask benefits provides.

In Australia Flu infections plummeted almost nothing. I've actually caught flu horrifying experience wish anyone. save others wearing mask months years that's brainer me. shit read fake British accent. went Austin Powers. 2/10 enjoy. Humanity encountered black death, wiped 60% population Europe, znd yet returned socialising l.

Spanish flu killed millions, yet people stay locked houses.

Why woukd COVID much milder virus end socialising? Hence waiting Biden take office real pandemic response fucking stupid. Trump removed office months ago. divorced parents means happier healthier parents yes. contribute high-quality information. require users submit reliable, fact-based information

It's fact Chinese virologist/defector claims coverup China Covid-19 vowes publish proof virus made lab. remove unless there's agenda play? lot people got along fine pressures lockdown way handle arbitrary measures Government bailouts cheap foreclosed properties buy up, seems fine them. really think society literally pouring money foundational science. thing redeem capitalism actually make future better. $3M effective COVID treatment? literal drop ocean. answer medical question?  solution easy: assume everyone virus. afraid catching it, self-isolate never catch it.

Let grandma enjoy last days/weeks/months living life fullest instead shaming her. still die year wants go terms. 

And there's nothing selfish entitled authoritarians it. This. parents / guardians paying education, there's built-in expectation kids try hard learn make investment ""worth it."" really change culture inside classroom fewer kids going blow assignments distract class without repercussions parents.  Full faux outrage answer question then, expected. thought new normal already. That's much higher US per capita basis Kudos people taking initiative move forward other. 

I agree. Divorce failure. Sometimes someone meant life short while. Maybe person kid spend rest life with. ok. hurts one stay miserable. true, but:

a) many people died black death increasingly common belief witnessing extinction species. towns villages, majority population died.

b) plague outbreaks somewhere world believe around 300 years. like years hell back normal; hung around.

Thankfully covid-19 bad that, think important keep mind species lives mean totally suck ass whole time. surge divorce good children then... Ok dr oz 36% probably even bother listening part word ""better"". Nope, commuting. could get outside more, I'm definitely going take suggestion thank making it. using melatonin, honestly keep forgetting. need get s*** together again. :-) need quarantine close contact someone lives someone tested positive covid? (Girlfriend's mom tested positive) still woefully stupid. would 100% rather New Zealand's situations there's couple thousand quacks compared negligent president office. Agree 100%. I'm late end college age ( grad student -27). would never ever behaved like younger. think college stressful need risk health everyone else's, mental stability stay home parents.

These adults. need coddled sheltered. need responsible. excess deaths, derpie, existence deaths make deaths meaningless excess deaths.

which means deaths otherwise would occurred. *related* key word. death test patient see corona label covid-19 death. heard guy died motorcycle accident also covid announced corona death drive city bus highly doubt true. rising though Whereas, Europe, different kind problem. Life nice here, people sort assume follow rules life continue nice - except rules handed above, ignore really nobody watching, life continue nice.

Of course, ago life really nice all, everyone forgotten that. Stuff already almost normal right stuff starting open except peoppe masks on. Disregarding Canada's superior social safety net, US overall cheaper. Canada's housing market terrible atm (it's bad US well, bad). Food almost 2x expensive Canada. salary 2x would Canada. Travel better US, big cities closer together much see do. mentioned weather well, sucks parts Canada. Packages ordered arrived much sooner US. Also access certain shows Netflix YouTube Canada pain ass.

I could go thought more. top head. past tense though moved Germany work. enjoyed life US much Canada. Whether Oxford vaccine effective little bearing effectiveness vaccines  South Dakota close 30% lower peak 10 days ago so.... Broken contact tracing. Well, I'll give that. doubt ""massive recessions"" occur live entertainment sector. mean people able pursue happiness longer locked relationship breeds hate contempt? 

All virus done expose underlying problems. Kudos people taking initiative move forward other. shouldn’t expect pressure people stay miserable, that’s incredible act selfishness avoid. Pfizer moderna pause. even need toilet paper?  100% agree. media doesn’t want lose fear based control people already democrats like Kamala Harris saying take ""the trump vaccine"". Democrats creating antivaxxer crowd. Fucking hilarious. Oh, mean live fantasies people wronged loved ones year assholish COVID deniers?  sides polarized Trump... symptom divide, necessarily cause. People already whatever want, don’t even vaccine yet. think people believe eldery family members death hurt much. aunt really belives shit like that. disgusting belives people ""move on."" neighbors wife died next day wife things boxed up. aunt goes ""see death big deal."" mean, empathy would wearing mask following cdc guidelines like rest us. matter opinion point. see coming way completely locking patrols enforcing policy jail time that's bit dystopian ... comes beginning's end. Cases rising Dakotas. Vietnam simple understand. Universal masking even first case!!! Read when, why. I'm sort person who's usually interested big events anyways. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUIIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

Whhhhyyyyy 😭 idiots exist? stay home, please least make country go back lockdown. Booker, librarian mother two Mount Vernon, Washington, went several iterations “Team Booker Daily Schedule.” “I seen one floating around Facebook different colors thought, ‘Well, that,’ ” told initial enthusiasm. 7-year-old son it—“He top was,” said—so kept up. Eventually, son’s school developed robust online learning plan, Anne shifted routine. “It basically three walks day whatever school stuff June.” “by time June rolled around school ending, walking five seven miles day, think tired. didn’t want anymore.” summer schedule devolved 1) play outside morning, 2) come back “do things”—those things mostly watching TV playing iPad. school started back up, “the schedule pretty well set school,” Anne told me. Still, back three walks day.

For talk scheduling failures, seems pretty successful though bet lot personality kid rather organizational skills parents. 5 7 miles walking day lot. Probably he's old wise enough know helping community makes difference, paying taxes state federal government end actually helping many people, instead enriches cronies politicians. considered fact empathy, hold different view proper course action? Obviously problem now, part government response problematic telling us wear masks. Including essential workers could ""stay home"".

Politicians continued mixed messaging started beginning, that's problem too. better grow ""broken family"" 2 parents hate other. Also, thing ""broken family."" Families come shapes sizes. totally agree you. “before times” would never used pickup. pleasantly surprised produce fulfilled me. Oh god, don’t let us anywhere. Jfc. Wow.....

People say thing employees tobacco companies. I'm saying restaurant dining comparable smoking, guilt trip similar. safe safe. wise man said: Stupidity repeatedly thing hoping different outcomes.  Oh, same, dude. never thought much trying leave country since mask protest people idk super popular yet people hate Fausi blaming pandemic getting bad?? like r/enoughfausispam There’s clear massive difference bombed foreign country standing 6 feet apart Starbucks know members community judge deserving. federal help, help goes strangers know can't judge deserving not. post comment removed

Good news isnt welcomed sub like it? make money US (but there's universal healthcare), weather better parts country, things cheaper, think. miss? :) Luckily people currently staying home filtered air wearing masks time right now. much this. Real talk. Probably. way states opened quickly huge outbreaks suddenly started gaining ""control"" outbreaks White House ordered data sent HHS instead CDC. Especially Politico released leaked emails showing aides HHS telling CDC release certain reports Caputo's aide reviewed given line-edit powers tweak data line President Trump's downplaying virus. I'm tired lied pandemic. Yeah headline wrong. Yeah, know. Lucky us different. existence type spread obvious soon pandemic began. Thanks input, CumBlaster1200 mean doesn't. grandfather grandmother died 90s. fine deaths even though close them. told peace deaths 70s. Grandmother switched ACTIVELY asking die wishing would die Grandfather died. legit dead serious wanting live anymore.

She found pleasure alive nursing home dementia ward wheelchair adult diaper. happy move better place. made clear.

Everything place everyone good, modest, quality life. Things like healthcare, food quality, workers rights, environmental protections, policing largely solved problems. Nobody afraid - would be? people land one.

However becomes easy forget toil sacrifice went achieving that, also results strong desire things stay - nothing broken, fix it? rock boat? They're trying accurate? incredibly unlikely, sure, athletes sometimes suffer health problems. want care but...  Part problem though government weaponizing mask over-politicizing it. Trump administration hellbent downplaying fucked public’s opinion regard consequence.

It became hard convince people wear masks damage done Trump Co. made big deal wearing one. trust National Law Review -- would assume know case law. already knew, though, HIPAA apply employers. ADA does.

Edit: even read link? ""The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards protect individuals' medical records personal health information applies health plans, health care clearinghouses, health care providers conduct certain health care transactions electronically. ""

Edit: strange thing downvoted for. HIPAA covers ADA covers exactly opinion. truly believe taken seriously BEGINNING, action global level could stopped able near identical virus back 2003... especially since know informed Trump early on, even China still covering things up. considering similarity SARS dumbfounded one taken seriously.

But also pretty sure lack safety measures beginning contributed overcrowding hospitals, contributed excess number deaths... covid. fault ""fat"". Mike Osterholm im mistaken one mask wearing unless N95’s? Correct im wrong. like there's airborne virus going around people spreading people without knowing it. believe deserve break quarantine life, impose risk people never viewed people anyway *need* treat. Tell us fear mongering seriously

You freakin anti Fauci disconnects Whah asshole, pandemic hospitalizations floor. reason continue stupidity.

Reference. No, boys cosplay are. think unreasonable expect others same.

Not unreasonable - agree. naive think something generally happens. Right millions people country sure Sturgis caused 12 billion dollars healthcare costs caused quarter million people get covid.

dropping realest facts I've ever seen reddit. Also scariest.  Maybe Fauci encouraged masks get go then? looking what's safer wanting hysterical you, think bit warped definition word.

covid19 make life significantly dangerous. like said, afraid normal everyday risks, makes sense afraid well. Nah. One day it’s gonna disappear, like miracle. /s barbaric?? 
It definitely tough (some students come Hubei stay indoors 2 months) work well US - example much data privacy track trace effective can't say it, obviously tolerate West.
But super effective. Everyone wears masks life economy back normal months. Nobody got dragged ""camps"". contact case quarantined either home hotel - inconvenient boring inhumane. richest, powerful country world killing 200,000 citizens negligence might viewed little inhumane though. thoughts exactly, better expressed!


Kudo! stop Every covid-19 death deserves thread. we'd simply mimicked countries control, WOULD CONTROL. Stop resigned ""it's cycle"" FFS, listen yourself, problem, magnified millions times pigheadedly stupid people like you. lack social empathy- loud rude public spaces, littering, driving dangerously, wearing mask pandemic. “i’ll want, want” No. contact people close relatives roommates covid far I've negative. hand, mother law covid fine. visiting Austria March heading valencia fallas everything shut return home making hop over. Here's hoping next March looks better love going every year  cruises terrible enviroment miss RSVPing Facebook concerts food truck festivals date arrive go “oh that’s TODAY? Oops.” Ah, well that's fine hope live 26 months I'll pans are. typically involve multiple vehicles, likely increased traffic. 

Ok. agree there, guess. Traffic leads fatalities. best reduce traffic. Looking there's two ways could that:

1. Increase roadways
2. Decrease car usage

Number one tried many places, general consensus ""if build it, come"". Adding lanes roads draws cars use bigger roadways much traffic, more. 


Number two accomplished making public transportation easier. Right kind shit America, mean can't improved. said public transportation show many times safer driving. also show reduce carbon emissions, better guess favor banning cars makes consistent, even consistently hysterical.

If looking what's safer wanting hysterical you, think bit warped definition word. US world hub 350 million people. virus 100% chance spreading every state. Honestly, country wasnt fucking obese better health care system everyone coverage alone would saved thousands lives. wrong. WhOsE gOnNa PaY MeDiCaRe aLl
?!? US partially locked nowhere near long enough. Spread covid though social proximity mobility.... country experiencing rapid growth spread covid, people distancing enough mobile. Yeah, daycare essential, children age can't stay home own. Also, people think doctors nurses able go work? tons professions *can't* stop, even fantasy world given money stay home need work survive. Shucks that's nice. figured dangerous stage actually go clinic several hours efficacy trial. It'll cost several hours hey. best case, get saline injection, works, contribute somehow. worst, face falls (kidding) Thank Trump started all.  Sure, what's million mask money compared billions mismanaged relief funds?  much trouble grasping honesty hard leaders almost always makes solutions easier short long term. Particularly governmental system citizens supposed part process. I'd say spoiled, yeah too. Well call completely shocked this. never knew! /s

😐 did. It’s theory. There’s nothing proven true.  little, 200k late? Far deadly harder transmit. Covid novel incredibly easy transmit pathogen similarly easy transmit incredibly high mortality rate/risk hospitalization ignorance American people almost certainly let COVID win. “Researchers suggest” translates “this theory without verifiable evidence back otherwise would read “data suggests” hotels, like mine, actually taking seriously. Everyone check temp arrive (even exec team), housekeepers cannot go room 3 4 hours guest leaves, room order next morning, single groups shuttle, check-in done car. 

A things mandated corporate part it’s team works hard keep everyone safe possible. 

In end, it’s going differ every hotel based leadership (plan place associate compliance)

Ninja edit: I’m resort several management companies manage homes/condos. Saw email today back-to-back reservation condo extremely upset realized unit managed another company. email unit sale, guest checks out, unknown number people come view listing, guest checks later night. Completely procedures, even weren’t supposed potential buyers visiting. yeah, real life example difference protection procedures company company. team would unavailable check-out, order showing day two, back rotation day after. way would let different groups unit within hours other. Ohhhh. Got it. Youre spot Trump, believe &amp; worship Trump could care less American people's health. I'm honestly going keep wearing masks way past Coronavirus. Nobody needs exposed ugly mug, think masks cute. lmao Dear fellow actual real American friends, wear masks bad you! Love, Vlad. hope husband shop he’s keep going. It’s huge blow lose shop worked hard for. I’ve team 3 years it’s rare find people tolerate long industry. 

I appreciate suggestions, too. Unfortunately feel totally crushed losing dream shop team, entertaining many ideas moment keep pushing creativity make ends meet. I’ve already completely burnt dealing mental health pandemic. (NOT fun person works around pathogens keenly aware global novel virus pandemic) is, haven’t drawn anything weeks. can’t find me.

Movies open America hardest hit country full people dumb you. dad almost 70 idea is. Though claims never received smallpox vaccine. know would remember since eradicated time reached young adulthood... Canada’s population: ~35 million

US population: ~330 million

Canada’s COVID deaths: 9,000

US COVID deaths: 194,000

The US roughly 10 times larger population 22 times recorded deaths, cases deaths US underreported. He's probably delusional narcissism thinks everyone vote matter does. I'm Biden fan bit concerned mental state Trump's response suggests he's far mentally unstable makes obvious can't office 4 years. Fun fact! Air 10C 7% dense air 30C.

Probably non zero impact severity (more particles), I'd assume still pretty negligible.  one years comprehend issue wearing masks. Many us don’t understand now.

Are kidding? years incorporated venerable conspiracy theories. People stop believing bullshit, it'll stop mattering believe it. Americans fucking weak. stamina adversity whatsoever. Anyone thinking vaccinate entire population delusional. take many months. immunization 1770s it’s like today single injection low risk mild symptoms. Edward Jenner didn’t even develop revolutionary cowpox-based vaccine smallpox 1796. best inoculation technique Washington’s disposal Revolutionary War nasty sometimes fatal method called inoculation doctor would cut incision flesh person inoculated implant thread laced live pustular matter wound,” explains Fenn. “The hope intent person come smallpox. smallpox conveyed fashion, usually milder case contracted natural way.” thought quite also percentage positives low also. seem genuinely got good control covid last 6 weeks.
Perhaps tribal / feudal leading remaining bubbles?
Bangladesh likewise managed much better India also despite high density population, poverty similar diet genes. Percentage particles blocked masks - 99,98%

Surgical mask - 97,14%

Homemade (1layer fabric + 4 layers paper towel) - 95,15%

However notice that's percentage blocked particles percentage reduction getting disease. comes percentage reduction risk infection:

[washing = -16 -21%

Homemade -67%; medical masks = -85%; respirators = -96%

[Staying distance 1 others = -82%

So: order calculate risk infection use formula

Total percentage change = [A + B + mask + washing hands = -0,16 + -0,67 +(-0,16 \* -0,67) = -0,7228

homemade mask + washing hands + 1m distance = -0,7228 + -0,82 + -0,7228 \* -0,82 = -0,950104

edit: sauces moral values? exist lol. fuuuuuck good intellectual integrity tho Honestly, would love research proved mask wearing absolutely this. I’m big proponent “wear damn mask,” it’s good masks create Circles Protection (for Magic: TG friends) good hear. like looked Asia thought people must idiots safe conformist many people actually died? linked article say reason. Orange County, California Floria? read article? slam-dunk obvious thing. possible side effect comes masks *not* 100% effective. Less developed countries get Pfizer vaccine soon since US basically buying entire stock. Things Fall Apart good book Pema Chodron helped exact issue.  know, keep seeing people say this, think ""did read metaphorical articles, skim fucking headlines?""

*I* remember experts saying ""don't buy n95's right now, really hard get people need them, especially reached Bumfuck, Pennsylvania yet. Also, know well homemade masks work, since brand new virus.""

It never ""face masks help."" ""please make impossible buy n95's buy toilet paper."" even told there's way many still listen. I'm really loss words selfish many people are. Ya, makes happy I'm traveling staying hotels right now.  i'd say no, since start recommending masks much changed except recommended types masks. hypothesis college student, continue demonize fellow classmates think holding stupid ass covid parties good idea. actually one arguments made detractors seat-belts.  Symbiosis human memes viral genes. understand everyone needed told. did. went far believe instructions able trust. Almost dumb people thinking masks social distancing make virus contagious flu. Think this: canine actually kill virus. vaccine teaches yourimmune system kill virus. naive contains piece virus, immune system detects it,recognizes foreign body, figures destroy it. That's thing find wild. immune system figures outs own. figures destroy virus ship whenever exposed. course, it’s decision want interact me. don’t want risk people potentially infecting self-isolation good strategy. China, country silence billion potential whistleblowers, can't keep people apart long enough suppress/eradicate respiratory disease. That’s one way it.. highly suggest learning relaxation techniques, sake. human isn’t meant prolonged periods anxiety. police officer? vulnerable exposure it. also, in, true: water wet!  hell talking about? I'm sorry going that. know tattoo shops run like family, I'm sure especially sucky happen. spouse also tattoo artist. He's shop accord high risk live hotspot, feel safe go back. unique position however shop seems ok overall state loosey goosey shutting things (which agree with, hey live here) still open well.

I'm sorry upcoming unsolicited advice, I'm watching husband going thing, here's stuff we've trying. know long shot sales little far us (but also admittedly suck social media/marketing), sell prints online? Stickers? T-shirts? sort zoom art class instruction? shops state/county shut completely one? Also could making asymptomatic, causing spread guard down. 200 vaccine candidates worked on.** production deals lined up. ""real world context"" grossly simplified view reflect reality. indeed working vaccine available mass production

There 6-7 Phase III mentioned several times, top candidates huge pharma companies tie-ups set already produce large quantities. There's simply question able 'produce scale'. yes, comment made sense world production huge issue, one clearly promising vaccines question, one sensible pinning hopes vaccine that's candidate no. 199 pharma company that's 6 months behind leaders backing produce large say that. Therefore clarified that. 

He say that, given. Yes, one's interested working vaccine can't produced, news, water wet. I'm saying odd thing point out. Pneumothorax also occurs acts violence. Somehow ""educated friends"" could see nations managed near universal mask use well virus nations spotty mask use poorly? Extinction event Came say this! Yeah never really understood - lockdowns make sense whilst bolstering supplies/preventing surge *or* attempting eradicate.

The EU broadly never tried latter, I'm sure duration places. guess delay carnage closer vaccine time, least, know masks/treatment/vitamin etc now... Oooohh yes are! also know plenty idiots think hoax flu. stupidity selfishness people never ceases shock truly hope future generations incapable understanding idiotic whole mask situation is. would mean we’ve grown society Whatever anti-vaxxers do, opposite. Asymptomatic transmission, yes, everything said, add stupidity, also COVID seems respiratory disease blood clotting disease... which... means... potential cardiac issues Yeah, explain article linked. Imagine getting downvoted expressing sympathy. Second wave inbound. No. need continue wearing time we're public forever. 60,000 people die every year US flu. Best movies ever made came year. Go fuck around mean? get ignorant keep ;)  Always told wearing properly patients, yeah it’s 100 percent preventative. There's really contagious thing kill someone love. Evidence shows wearing cheap surgical mask bandana help protect you, definitely help protect around you. even wear outside away people.

Idiots: ""nah, wanna"" Wtf talking about? I'm picturing Obama's version one press conference he'd need call topic:

He'd issue sort ""federal emergency xyz"" statement and/or order. Make masks mandatory, issue lockdown guidelines, somber hopeful, would it. He'd issue updates virus spread, treat seriously, we'd probably now. None ""every-state-for-themselves-I'm- not-going-to-wear-a-mask nonsense. excuses ""not starting panic"" everyone child can't follow directions he's parent deciding can't handle. simple, direct, clear, to-the-point leadership getting done. minor cold weeks back despite taking necessary precautions protect COVID past 6 months (yes, got tested COVID). I'm sure I'm person frankly acknowledge despite best efforts, can't combat quadrillions entities cellular level 100% efficacy. 

We need start honest discussions regarding concept putting life hiatus we've eliminated virus. current path tenable mortal bodies environment find in.

(Spoilers: original goal flattening curve eliminating virus. People seem forgotten goal, including scientific hegemony point.) respect virus, sure, political situation still going kinds fucked.  made go check numbers damn right HIV.

New infections 2019: 1.7 million.  
Deaths 2019: 690,000.  
Est total deaths since start epidemic: 33,000,000

The vast majority happening subSaharan Africa little US. Probably people US mention much anymore. however mostly localized West Africa requires body fluid contact. high fatality rate nearly easy transmit. 

Deaths 2014-2016 epidemic: 11,325   
Approx 50% survival rate. Influenza Season. 
Deaths US: 34,200 (similar 2012-2013 ""Hmm sheets smell like buttsex?"" IDK help anti-mask nonsense, since stems type BS ""generates"" anti-vaxxers etc. course, quite bad, ballpark, ask me. anti-vaxxer; wearing N95’s like they’re going style. kind immunity celebrate: natural immunity.

Okay, I’m ready ride karma oblivion. Masks were, couldn’t get anywhere. That’s tutorials came make own. 

Now production up, kid colour coordinating masks clothes. daughter would always bring home kind bug school least couple times year. guaranteed would pass along rest us home. Schools naturally festering cesspool bacteria viruses. Anyone believes coronavirus somehow exempt latching kids families never lived children. almost seems commander chief complete fucking asshat number studies. sneeze study (MIT? forget) transmission 27 feet one. restaurant study went particular spreading event air flow measurements modeling infected not. 

Here list  mind blowing! cousin PATHOLOGIST studies diseases living wear masks. I'm like, bro, dont look /r/coronavirus ?? need wear mask. Dont make excuses like PhD Biology focus infectious diseases scapegoat get it. sad.  um dr fauci one i'm listening to. yeah us prefer plan lives around good information Thought already knew this... ago!! 2 questions. saying higher rates asymptomatic people good thing immunity. people asymptomatic highly contagious people severe symptoms? saying less symptomatic less contagious are?

And second question hell simulate ""surgically masked hamster""?? dozens similar tests developed tested around world.

Some saliva tests, breath tests, blood tests, even one based voice.

Whichever accurate, cheap, scalable, used. think comes surprise. passed around care homes last time due staff family members infected elderly care homes needing hospital treatment picking hospital. would different time?

In England, really needed irresponsible, large minority better time 'round, part, inevitable spread among vulnerable coming. Hospitalisations starting creep spread care homes starting creep up: small, malnourished stoat could tell what's coming next. Really helped allergies year too. Way less asthma attacks. usually weeks year trees trying kill step outside, year OK never go outside without mask on. Wow, comm center super strict it. officers allowed room, all. Anytime leave main floor, reason, wear mask. coming shift leaving car comm room mask on. Also easy problem solve. Require retailers sell certain amount per capita. bulk buying. entitled selfish behaviors individuals refuse inconvenienced would problem. Writers piece:

A blind man could see wearing masks effective WEARING ONE FFS alive. Right now. life. Live it. Let go loss live new life. got this. could somehow find way people ingest light...perhaps mixing strong detergent? 🥴 Louisiana, doctors I've seen hospitals exactly like this. short term, would hoarding even bigger facemask shortage health professionals essential workers. long term, would help credibility government health authorities. message brought people ""Marijuana cures cancer"" Viruses become deadly. hosts mean chances happening. want least amount people infected. Normally deadlier virus problems spreading, asymptomatic carriers super spreaders, deadly mutation could defeat odds real damage. even worse outcomes people survive normal strain! would made sure get influenza, important. managed excellent job controlling outbreak well save economy, placing well people first.

How welding citizens apartments die equate placing well people member disinformation campaign. could say you, would ever convince other?

I think quite obvious right wrong is. GOP surely pushed people return work, nothing close locking people homes without food medical care. Yea, China's GDP grew ends justify means.

History kind side totalitarianism, oppression, cruelty. mean need give freedom breathe everything people breathe out? Crazy.    imagine chaotic going get next months. Countless people common colds flu trying get tests think Covid, drawing valuable resources needed elsewhere. It'll certainly case England, I'd imagine go many countries. get live vaccine possible shed virus infect others. maybe would like getting live I've working hospital entire time hope I've peppered enough COVID particles inoculated now. I'd love antibody test easier come by. u rollout national lockdown, virus states, jumping county county state state. means education would disrupted gap, statistically leads significantly higher drop rates.

only things left equal. there's billion things accommodate group. thing statistics control variables, numbers really mean anything. could, example, switch kids year-round system accelerate curricula mandate one two years summer school. fucking hard. wait around someone tell you, ""actually nothing going change global pandemic that's good thing"" accept answer TB vaccine causes scar that's common vaccine countries. fucking moron, stupid fuck ""voters"" like main reason shit.

Bet genuine MORON voted Trump. crazy irresponsible. data time SARS, China's COVID outbreak, Spanish flu, respiratory viral outbreaks, suggested masks kind including cloth masks could help curb transmission, also set cultural precedent mask wearing. Hell, I'm surgeon general even confused time pushing cloth masks. What's more, public health officials actively stigmatized mask-wearing, point reading posts FB reddit threatened violence ""selfish assholes"" wearing masks. Hindsight 20/20, sure, Leslie Knope would say, regular sight caught one. Lol, you’re completely fucking retarded. wish could upvote thousand times. They're trying treat like Sandy Hook people responsible look less bad Well stupid fuckhead, **your ""democracy""** fucking rigged.

R U fucking MORON? entirely correct. 

You correct optimal situation everyone wearing good masks properly. However, good mask decent job individual. great, it’s reasonable decrease likelihood infection hypothesized (and article backs up) masks reduce viral load received. 

Properly wearing good mask, even unmasked crowd, gives better odds survival people around you. know fields countries one things learned PPE last resort carrying risk assessment. said, normally one cheapest easiest things implement usually mandated along measures.  Good, fucking hate shit, I'm glad helping.

I bbq godamn awful stupid fucking masks, nobody likes nonsense there's reward end rainbow abiding what's right nice read affirmation nothing. 

I'm glad something bullshit, wish could gun fire something else that's quick I'll take get. Fuck you, batplague i'm imagining bunch cute costumed children storming state legislature guns tote. trying kick open doors failing course, that's standard risk, nothing unusual, kids die flu. sad can't wrap kids cotton wool. words, Tan says, ""If vaccinate 100 people, 50 people get disease.""

How going quantify that? around 50% people won’t symptoms anyway, without vaccine, able attribute vaccine? understanding masks prevent transmission wearer much efficiently protect wearer. working place one else wore mask, I'd use one exercise ones ventilators protect wearer much better almost nothing around them.

If I'm wrong this, please correct me.  well we're also taking steps help distance better less densely populated country notes avoid public transport systematic steps make safer. example city effectively doubled number buses running run chunks two allow plenty space along guidelines avoid possible. 

Almost education ages 16 held online home bunch guidelines systematic adjustments made. might freedom countries we're definitely nothing.

and almost million people dead already even first wave. i'm sure expecting people actually following guidelines kind need refer models specify social conditions are--i think many account white house disinformation campaigns shoddy public health policies, people actually wearing masks staying away large gatherings Never put source Bild, sensational newspaper shit, always saying something correct day  remember early studies healthcare workers shocked dozens people hospital already within days admitting COVID patients, asymptomatically (there Dutch study this). Masks one way explain that. Thanks, didn’t know that. Sounds like good location racial diversity perspective then. whoa cool 200k americans. 700k+ worldwide. Thats 700k families devestated virus could gone week idiots made last 8 months. Tiny bit naive believe people still hoard masks. number deaths that's really relevant restrictions, number new *cases*. there's quite those. Every square rectangle every rectangle square?

Damn, take vitamin D3 K2 it’s over? 

Dude... Exactly. Pretty much England. always believed numbers would begin rise long opening up, would take bit time get around due starting low base. So, back end July thought time start things numbers low still real possibility everything locked confined limited options. So, went Wales 10 days recently started swimming morning. But, I'm still careful: pubs night go me, pop quick pint go straight beer garden I've served.

Here England, best bit living careful July August virus likely reappear vengeance given lack care displayed large minority, seems already control virus verge control stricter measures necessary get grip it. real vaccine masks made along way. We're trained tolerate hellish work lives 

You talk people immigrated work countries actual hellish work lives(like Japan) American workers. pretty funny hear things say us liberals home complaining bad everything is.

Americans weak work too. Ok kinda validates theory got professor. 

I’m school physical therapist assistant, one professors works hospital right street us. Back early February went back school, persistent dry cough. right Kobe died one paying attention virus. campus us two hrs week, wasn’t one lecturing, assisting. mentioned one point nonchalantly, “I know shouldn’t saying this, persistent dry cough driving crazy.” don’t think anyone really heard her, time felt like one seemed aware virus, think ears already turned saying since coughing much. 

Then, last week February/early March, got low grade fever. felt like knives chest coughed sore throat. following week world shut down, couldn’t breathe. vertigo, light headed, weird chest pressure. scary didn’t want admit going on, especially since symptoms weren’t bad hearing others. 

Flash forward next months, phlegm extremely hard get chest. experienced SOB while, fires California, progress made no-more-stuck-phlegm non-existent. persistent cough dizziness again. I’ve always struggled allergies past, never extent I’ve dealt last months since March. It’s insane, poor husband tired hearing trying clear chest every day lol. 

I also mention 2 professors have, students, husband, showed minor symptoms well. 

I kept saying loud, “I’m pretty sure virus, smaller amount it,” underneath would doubt thinking, “but doesn’t make sense everyone involved little cluster would show minor symptoms.” 

But make sense. professor dry cough February doesn’t get flu shot every year. flu season wear mask hospital. We’re SoCal, right next LA. There’s doubt came contact people didn’t know anything yet. dry cough exact dry cough professors have. original professor must’ve small viral reaction, therefore viral load smaller therefore rest us experienced minor symptoms. 

So I’m crazy lol. exposed it. renewed asthma symptoms kid head. I’m grateful didn’t get flu shot last season (even though usually suggest everyone get lol). can’t imagine symptoms long term issues worse are. 

I continue wear mask every day till thing control. great tool protection. Marsh v Alabama? Really curious. That, non hoarders deciding better pick pack even need yet, found stock people hoarding them. could kill though. Thank TLDR. Title clear. great news. try wear mask even more. Correlation causation. husband works 12 months year assume.

NO. Fuck self absorbed attitude. People fucking dying. really discounting Fox News viewers elected Trump first place. discounting crisis leadership top bottom country. Trump symptom, he's root cause disease. Much worse expected? Get fuck outta here. expected anyone brain. couple friends repaired marriages due COVID-19.

they stuck together figure I've trying hard wrap mind around can't.

""I've listened everything said, well-reasoned arguments, lot makes sense. However, end day, would keep want, I'm listening. I'm also sorry."" 5 10 years completely different things.

Except made pretty much material lying around house. hospitals buying thousands masks Amazon Home Depot, distribution channels never same...

The CDC responsible tens thousands deaths little white lie. lesson ages. able read simple sentences?  Dude, can’t eat mask on. believe me, also people working restaurants happy working again. know workers actually contract virus plants?

Should Feds also fine hospitals schools healthcare workers teachers dying due lack safety standards? Many healthcare workers went without PPE months teachers students forced back class little precautions, seem safe anyone.

Or essential workers exploitable others? isolate USA world H1N1? countries respective diseases? gyms? local gym, requires masks worn going out. facility gets packed social distances window. cancelled membership. live Midwest public indoor places it’s 10/10 there’s mandate. never see people inside anymore without masks. US plan assume people know use calculators?

If did, they'd realize ""plan"" millions dead virus can't find uninfected hosts.

Brilliant. Since that's valid ""strategy"" now, let's release plagues we've worked centuries contain let sweep population too.

Where we? Hundreds thousands dead, million go reach ""herd immunity"" fancy way saying outbreaks longer containable.

Must Q-anon kool aid convincing people ""herd immunity"" means ACTUAL immunity. guess ""letting everyone get infected"" test well focus groups.

Quick math:  Current US tests 6MM, deaths 180k. puts fatality per case rate around 3%. ***EDITED ADD (this CFR. Calculation reach IFR reasons follow)***

Now multiply 200M + Americans need infected reach ""herd immunity"" fatality rate .03. Go ahead. I'll wait.

 Yes, read zeros right.

And yes, that's dead Americans TOTAL death toll Holocaust.... 

... ecxept that's US, Americans DONE dying, one actually developed immunity. means pre-existing conditions taking precautions longer anywhere hide people would come contact infected.

Unfortunately, what's reported case rate really reflection whether tests available, strong indications actual infection rate much higher documented. GOOD news drops death projection, even 1 5 cases detected studies concluded, we're still conservatively looking US deaths 7 figures.

***EDITED ADD: adjustment would also shift death rate downward ratio (from CFR IFR). already baked everything else said including ultra-conservative death projection reaching 7 figures, I'm clarifying anyone trying compare IFR published data.***

Maybe get lucky. Maybe vaccine works widely distributed end 2021, broader point know...  we've repeatedly lied to, even numbers I've shared accurate data Trump admin released. 

The US push vaccine ahead testing political reasons, disaster caused generations distrust.

It's worthless without public trust, yet Trump still pushing hydroxychloronique recently despite study study showing benefit increased risk heart attack, we've heard tapes saying early February aware covid death rate 5x worst flu seasons... hours saying opposite public ridiculing took steps could contained it.

Are prepared bet life Trump telling truth? 

Where we? Neck deep gaslight zeitgeist viewed future lucky enough live long like Salem witch trials historians wonder sort toxin food caused mass hallucination. well doctor article reported long-term symptoms. person didn’t read article.... may need deserve. you? End party. Call cops people leave. behavior simply stop. sob stories excuses. people need see doctor, even though healthcare socialized still comes taxes. pay back portion negligence destructive behavior. Wear two masks? think that's completely unnecessary. Two masks going slow spread better one would. one mask enough slow chance spreading virus 80%. Social distancing cover 19%. serious numbers. though, think making right call taking advice isolating yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit: Apparently, multiple masks actually help.** restricted socialising five people time inconvenience, tragedy. feel awful putting district position

Why? district clearly feel awful putting position... said since beginning pandemic, see point post. fucked many reasons. $1500 ridiculous. could become corporate trainer something similar. keyword ""registered"".  I'm Republican. ""Live within mean"" old adage around long Republican Democrat formed. really need see everything bifocal lenses Republican/Democrat? someone live disadvantages/Great Recession/career downturns, believe agency rather reliance government. Saving rainy days live within means wisdoms stood time, social safety nets invented. ""Republican"" thing? mean sort dumb “analysis” markets probably says lot think coronavirus too. people bad analytical skills. 

I wonder person responded ever looked chart fed’s balance sheet since March? kidding, answer obviously not. Good thing shared opinion markets us though. lying said think looking Hello Kitty mask.

I've already bought 3 cat theme masks 2 decorative ones lol. figure fun it? Etsy lot talented people making them. Europa numba one! read article?

There another one women shared story dad died getting treatment. 

My heart goes people dealing it. really wish could buy island invite people believe science dumb ass politician conspiracy heads proven wrong time time again.

They confirm actual vaccine, placebo.


Edit:. Thanks whoever downvoted me. believe confirmed patient receive real COVID-19 vaccine placebo shot, diagnosis transverse myelitis yet confirmed may may linked vaccine ...and it?

If can't party control limit, party. one anyway, responsible results. FL college students re-entering campuses bars reopen. think happen FL's current great numbers next couple months? gamble health numbers going lower.  mean, technically someone passed out, driving, covid.

Ouch certainly rude one aren’t think read article? say reducing spread true, that's specific article about. side effect: reducing load individual gets, *but eliminating it*, getting accidental *individual* Also, there’s “secret” property cloth masks made specifically give low doses thus build immunity, it’s literally consequence material

Right. Hence use word ""accidental"" previous comment ""side-effect"" above. irony all, sort funny morbid better world, everyone would high grade mask

The thing missing specific kind immunity article would happen 100% adoption 100% effective masks. failures around edges providing small viral loads, *benefits* that, subject usually discussed. again, deliberate said nothing ""secret properties"". accidentally beneficial side effect not-perfectly-effective masks.

This usual science usual topic, understand jarring, read article. argument actually like this:  3 people die car wreck. One diabetes, one heart disease, one nothing like that.

Been clubs warhammer games, took GF dinners. gonna sit locked inside house trembling fear.  It’s silly compare STD’s respiratory illness. 1. really isn’t “buffer” provide protection others within infectious range sharing air sharing bed two different routes infection. 2. diseases listed never recovered argument invalid. You’re never immune something body never defeats. Teacher wants could use advice! done career pandemic revealed job education useless. want out. Du doi. Excess deaths equal COVID deaths, number bajillion. liberals socialists. 19.. people change, grow. Argue thing age really. emphasise learning, rehabilitation want better word.

Fine 2,000 court mandated, 3rd party dictated 5,000+ worth reeducation program.

Pointless learn nothing substantial experience  No, experience universal telling everyone is.  always taught reason first public schools funded, child labor taking jobs away adults. 

I wanna say industrial revolution? Could wrong though. Fact check me. still ranting vaccines. talk evil necessary general. 

\#monkeylivesmatter btw Epidemiologists disfavored travel bans long time actually much create lots problems. die, virus actually deadly - coronavirus deniers probably Yes, that's known months now. noted unproven according article. definitely around forever, matter happens Spain peaked 14 days ago. Deaths remain minimal.

Edit: days weeks Seriously, mind masks permanent thing either. problem UBI would really useful tied cost living would probably politically impossible. issue stimulus check - parts country 3 month's rent, others even close one month's.  Deaths still low 14 days peaking second wave Spain. ok. Turns wearing masks actually works. Dr. Scott Atlas, seems President listening now, setting next fall guy. don’t confirm case COVID isn’t counted COVID death die, unless tested every single dead person. 

So no, exactly. fighting survival good enough spammed? 


When people learn hundreds bodies piled third world countries virus real! countries decimated virus mine too! face fine teeth fucked up. Thankful masks 🙏 get unlimited breadsticks?? Luckily science run feelings science degree doesn’t understand airborne viruses. Yikes! Peeps Halloween Christmas always felt wrong me. don’t Easter, sad. Ah right BS That's fair. 

For me, see much difference. Decrying science saying ""it's cold"" lead others believe things, we're witnessing. Anyone could vector even showing symptoms. feel promote dangerous thinking guilty engage it. guilty things, still guilty damage society. opinion, course. There’s probably going another COVID-sized pandemic next 25yrs id gamble hope turns true. diligently wearing mask public work since May got much shit so. coworkers refuse wear masks vanity reasons (and suspect they're Covid deniers extent) always taking piss wear mine.  Usual reminder: Global Times tabloid run propaganda arm CCP. Use reliable sources possible. pretty clear English guy's first language. maybe hit vulnerable first.  Can't believe fucking September still see maskless snowflakes avoiding eye contact walk store like, bottle soda imsgh6tyghf f2f bv ""indeed"" stupid comment get upvoted. maybe i'm idiot missing sarcasm  coronavirus spreading care homes again, according leaked documents show government failing protect vulnerable spiralling number cases.

A Department Health report marked “official sensitive” circulated Friday stated rate coronavirus recorded satellite tests — almost take place care homes — quadrupled since start month. stands estimated 1,100 new cases every day.

Matt Hancock, health secretary, took emergency update Wednesday saying outbreaks detected 43 care homes months calm.

On Friday night wrote care home leaders confirm virus reappeared: “The infections are mainly affecting workforce clearly risk virus spread residents parts care sector.

“Unfortunately, care homes, recent outbreaks, appear occurred, residents also becoming infected.”

A memo sent health secretary’s team lists care homes Bristol, Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire Wolverhampton among worst hit.

At start pandemic decision move hospital patients into care homes, often without testing, contributed 20,000 Covid-related deaths.

To prevent another outbreak, government promised weekly testing for staff monthly tests care home residents July. reached target last week.

The majority (52%) Covid-19 tests carried care homes take 72 hours processed. 

In message care homes, Hancock ended warning potential dangers as winter approaches: “This winter place unique pressures health care system. Covid-19 circulating seasonal flu viruses transmission may increase.”

On day, scientists Imperial College London warned R infection rate reached 1.7 — meaning cases doubling week.

Last week care homes Newcastle, Gateshead Sunderland shut doors to visitors because early signs virus returning.

Jon Ashworth, shadow health secretary, said: “Failures tracing isolation mean infections rising. Failure protect care homes early meant many lost lives. would unforgivable mistakes made again.”

A health department source said: “We everything ensure care home residents staff protected, including testing residents staff; provided 200 million items protective equipment, ring-fenced £600m prevent infections care homes made £3.7bn available councils address pandemic pressures.” Christian. explains everything. Religion ignorance go hand hand.  *very* dangerous thing say. Cases rising Spain France despite mask mandates. **Keep distance people!** Ok...are guys gullible? 

Dr. Fauci said January wear masks. curing pandemic. 

Jesus christ... He’s talking return normalcy due widespread availability Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said remains confident vaccine available end year early 2021. ""But time mobilize distribution vaccine get majority population vaccinated protected, that’s likely going happen end 2021,"" said. ""If you’re talking getting back degree normality prior COVID, it’s going well 2021, towards end 2021."" China, India EU (with INSTEX) increasingly bypassing transactions US dollars trade Iran. far complete success, fool say nothing happening. great always super responsible careful, know that, unfortunately, every tattoo artist is.

My favorite bar - also gone business - old-school cocktail lounge, ever table service, usually half emoty, things space apart, kind place would interact new people, chat thr friends came with. There's reason place like open restaurants are. bars like - blame summer surge cases. bet interesting story tell happened values - least thought values were- changed time influences her. basically work like vaccine? Spain doing. Germany admitted went hardcore lockdown won’t go back ever. pretty light.  Also Pandemic Response Team dismantled, would ordered ramped production PPE preparation. part purpose. think can't handle symptoms yourself, feel like need assistance, means need go hospital. described that's immediate sign get hospital evaluation. older adults pass onto returned college Tuesday, end week began displaying COVID-19 symptoms.

Did NHS test informed self isolate take care.

The way describe like worst goddamn flu ever have. worst part gastrointestinal stuff. Losing sense taste really kills want eat.

Luckily I'm low risk I'm displaying mild symptoms.

It's miserable, painful, tiring.

Wear mask stay home. way lower deaths Europe compared first wave. means either way better treating it. Or, likely, enough testing first wave missed majority light medium infections. actual rate death way lower thought. like seeing now. go, 1541 day Yes, difference hypothesis theory important. sister’s nurse early March telling I’m idiot wearing mask. mortality though India rather low deaths per capita. Welcome club. I’m nurse, wife nurse. We’ve knee deep since day one members family told us it’s myth.... don’t fucking understand what’s happened country. Would love sources research purposes Wait...so Anti-maskers anti-vaxers along?

*insert Always Astronaut meme here* /s.

Well said. India extremely young population, always expected lower fatality rates west. America still struggling Eh... know I'd call ""failure"" like great situational misfortune befalling people, hands. control destiny. someone meant life short while, marry them. Perhaps changed somewhere along way, foreseen it. That's less ""failure"" still, might mitigated simply waiting longer get married judge someone's stability character. No, whiplash. monster half doctors seem think exists.  mind still massive difference people using common sense taking seriously - that's bad right - someone like fucker story basically knows sick infectious.

Not ignore that, *specifically* engaged activities almost guarantee infect untold others.

And that's exactly happened Don’t worry, get Biden sworn in, ruse end. still can’t believe got China entire world board this. 

/s well law. look up. :-)

But fair point. Perhaps used “hypothesis“ instead. 

My point idea/theory/hypothesis far proven even highly likely, stated researchers themselves. 

“*Still, Dr Monica Gandhi, infectious disease physician University California, San Francisco, one paper’s authors, stressed commentary limitations construed anything theory.*” Yup. sister believes it. devastated belief. Absolutely mind boggling  Paywall title linked article “The Latest: Austria’s leader says country seeing 2nd wave” love know happened Ref:

Convalescent plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain receptor binding domain IgG correlate virus bf Canadian, impression response American adequate, sane, measured - people willing compliant responsible, things opened, they're opened reduced capacity. 

Their economy currently growing twice rate US's, infections state(PA) entirety Canada. true things bit easier, Canada simply less people, fair share assholes North border too. fact matter better prepared(especially hit pretty hard SARS probably learning that), handled better, outcome better. 

It complete chaos states, government give single solitary fuck. Sweet Jesus, got divorced woman still living new dude? completely fucking unacceptable living situation, literally man could tolerate OK. Zen master could stay mentally sound situation. Get out. Whatever do, whatever costs. Get out.  actually scientist experience virology repeat ludicrous lie ""staying home 2 weeks"" would solved everything. People shot masks? mean.... body aches, cough, fatigue year would suck ass Unfortunately plenty real doctors taking proper precautions either. recently went orthopedic specialist (who supposed one best, sees pro athletes area) staff absolute WORST masks. Staff masks noses, allowing patients take masks, PA running around chin even came within like foot chin... wtf people. feel like heard numbers May... think serology surveys (meaning antibodies random sample necessarily ill / presenting hospitals).

If that's meant, would love see data 4 months later.

Could way virus now. one things we're allowed UK... honest, I'd take Proof u.s. overrun morons would botch response? I'll check snopes. makes sense, basically going Sparta way virus gets body.

Or let's say owe $1,000, pay back installments, maybe $100 month, manageable. full amount due right away, that's going put larger dent bank account. case, bank account immune system. schools open get herd immunity faster? children brave. Thank sacrifices. Spain still testing enough. friend get infected easy get test done. Wow bringing politics back argument!!! dare bring trump. supporting wearing masks sheep viruses infect sheep. Wolfs infect viruses stupid corona never show facw around /s. Damn obama amd creating viruses billion years ago. Thats didnt show birth certificate. Huh? Let guess. actually testing everyone?  take 3-4 weeks deaths catch up.

It's like 2-3 weeks. Median time death onset symptoms 15 days. Even factor time people spend pre-symptomatic, noticeable number outliers started dying 2 week mark. want ppl do? work? spend money? give amazon Netflix, pay taxes Europe. point see much wearing masks trying everything outside. pretty normal ask old someone die anything. even relatively educated moderate persons explain ""Bill Gates conspiracy"", ""It exist"", ""It hoax"". arrive point? head spinning. think it’s fear. control afraid dying. it’s relief hearing someone saying exaggerated. Meaning get angry, told threat real. 

One first employers kid hometown bombed WW2. told lot stories rumors circulated bombs partly fakes frighten people, pathetic consolations certain type buildings would struck - whatever gave relief situation, control. people refused take shelter sirens blasted “I leaving home, die die here” OMG! Mask give autisim! People's daily (which runs global times) literally part communist party. would issues BBC directly run Tories. rich countries, yes, rest world probably 2022, according someone would pretty good view it. Y'all sheep virus fake Nancy Pelosi proved . need see someone getting morality chip reinstalled; faulty. important thing need know country media ecosystem messed imagine. 
Most shills certain political party.

**Not one mention covid months.** 
Print bad yet legit anchors. Karan Thapar eg. interview Aishish Jha India's covid outbreak fastest growing informative. thought obvious back March/April NYC outbreak. giggle had. said stupid shit got called out.

Next say ""it prank, bro"".  fear dying, since they're completely wrong say chance dying very, low.

It's fear realizing they're selfish bad people. behavior directly hurting others. killing others. cannot accept that, somehow convince true. 


People want good. also want whatever hell feel like. Right 2 things mutually exclusive...unless hoax. know multiple teachers expected commute (and put kids daycare them) teach remotely empty classrooms. That’s right - students get stay home, teachers not. one schools, teachers sharing classrooms - like, two teachers, teaching different classes front computers time room. unsafe, also deal background noise. absurd country treats teachers. Let us know feel stopping catch breath halfway every flight steps rest life due lung scarring. Medication restricted activities due muscle damage heart. Short term memory loss. Phantom itching. Said absolutely nobody... Hey got signs job none too! Every Cancer death, heart disease, stroke, deaths devastated family. Oh forgot covid day. watched parents die extinct diseases suppose. Asshats hundreds cases deaths anywhere near what's happening US.

Okay, actually even know talking about.

Here talking about:

-Stuff gets worse

-Public tightens up, reducing spread.

-Stuff gets better

-Public loosens up, increasing spread.

Baselines different, behavior causes increases decreases places.

Would awesome area curve smaller? Yes, trick going getting ""things better, life go back normal"" **EVERYONE** across world experiencing. go ahead travel China March this? 
Also, community transmission entirely halted China March. So, anyone would quite safe travel there. would perfectly quarantined Chinese government neither threat threatened disease. 😆 UK, Spain, France Italy furlough schemes generous support people lockdowns. None countries afford lockdown again. 

Same country, federal government US states can't afford another lockdown. cost policy high much economic damage government debt accumulated already.

Lockdowns policy poor track record, numerous terrible side effects little scientific evidence supporting efficacy long term. willing stop pandemic, what's effective dealing pandemic. Not. Yeah. lot apocalypse LARPers sub. Shit take. Today criminals death row. 10 years petty crime. 50 years family gets disappeared harvested organs protest government. 

And think torture appropriate punishment arsonists? Really? I've seen dumb kids set fire trash cans leading $1000s damage schools public property. think ""man kid get waterboarded death"". Absolutely zero sympathy. new. Lockdowns start last week. consider lucky fine maxed 10k. family since February Exactly. information age midst war information.

Takes everything report get job shut down. Yeah people comply masks distancing. powerful myth. kill people Reasonable caution warranted, unreasonable caution dangerous People can't things think wrong deep heart hearts. justify behavior somehow. really want X, X ""good"" Y, dispel Y, brush unimportant, convince true, etc. Bad boys, bad boys. gonna do? gonna come f... 

“Oh fuck!” must've pleasant. Custom masks fun way retain humanity dark days. “Watching?!” We’re it.  Well, social distancing huge impact R0. Here's problem. need effective testing tracing translate lowered R0 containment eradication. vaccine help immensely, particularly ""dysfunctional"" societies, places we're tired social distancing.

But! still need testing distancing, prove cumulative (vaccine, distancing, etc.) mitigation shrinking number cases actually.

So laziness thinking vaccine silver bullet need improve systems bad.

And thing is, developed good testing tracing system starting March, we'd contained virus without vaccine.

So, yes, vaccines help matter what. alone they're enough, need order work would trick without vaccines anyway. So, make that? vaccine everything completely normal whether laws say not. People aren’t going stand staying 6 ft apart wearing masks arbitrary point may never ever hit achieved.

The flu vaccine didn’t stop flu. one won’t stop covid either. tell someone else ""are"" ? places nice beaches sunny weather winter months. limit Florida? beaches Thailand, Vietnam, China, Korea, pretty nice. countries probably cheaper Florida. 'luckily' type situation? Trumps lies, misdirection, exclusion disagreements Anthony Fauci briefings, deliberate obfuscation helped contribute anti-mask nonsense. Purposely. It’s blood majority nearly 200,000 deaths we’ve suffered hands. prolific American mass murderers. I'm weird spot. work tech programmer, machine control, arm machine.

The good news jerk twice things got lot better. second time, wrote polite email COO telling comfortable demos 20 people around desk, could please limit demos necessary individuals. polite apologetic it. 

Since then, people pretty decent. white house, literally stealing N95s PPE, giving companies owned Trumps, jack price sell middle-men. grandmother live nursing home.

Are really daft? idea sacrifice is? make sacrifices safe, ourselves. Covid kill, causes disability. grandmother's memory loss covid something I'd wish anyone... Neither bradycardia, symptoms pulmonary fibrosis diabetes. Exactly. He’s clearly intelligent scientist he’s psychic. opinion one sea well-informed diverse opinions. know doesn’t feel like it, making $15,000 year makes wealthy 90% world. yes, it’s wealthy country everyone global standards. problem is, things insanely expensive pretty high standard living, look global picture.

Not saying “bad”, really cant believe poor world is. fact ""comes sides"" means actually help, needs ""come sides"", rather carte blanche face holes. Also, may need mask upgrade. Gross, hate water gets wet. subreddit cares fines way carried unfortunately. They've picked student issuing unpayable fine instead punishing themselves. post unclear — right fucking losers, exactly? Along Vietnam POWs, women, ex-employees, minorities, 99% Americans, etc.? It’s hard keep track 😅 Testing much available?! sure that? Since They've spun much, they've ended inside asshole UK announced plan something like 10 million tests day, UK testing program chaos large backlog? UK government planning scale testing quickly? Asymptomatic long? takes time nasty virus replicate patients eventually become symptomatic Well convinced me, think convince conspiracy theory people know many words interrupt inject crazy claim conversation even get listen agree everything said go hang co-con-theorists agree everything said too.

I think reasoning way go. think, needs consequences gullible dumbass, social ostracism appropriate. lmao, recommended viewing: anecdotal 

Just FYI, anecdotal means based personal account instead known facts research. person proposing based facts research, personal account, fact based years years research albeit general knowledge perspective. like Johnny Doe posted Instagram, got information meme something girlfriend told happened her. would anecdotal. T_d empty banned. least tried.

Even becomes hot America least unified effort. 

Sweden research thought would happen hence policy restrictions. actually looked plan.

The EU went side caution tried contain this, buying time.

The US (federal) pretended like exist. plan. destroyed public trust health institutions. 

Even end place, responce lack thereof remembered history. hear say he's masks?

""[Masks strong statement could made, go whole body evidence. Who’s suggesting trying kill everyone? Fauci said shortage PPE healthcare workers sent message early on. Nothing new “proven” countries Asia knew this, western countries failed act. look compared Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, etc. Im saying canny choose law applies to, legal system completely fails know it. also explicitly said punished beyond insulting people like Dominic Cummings much worse given consequences government far severe get away whilst pick student whos vulnerable make example instead. know feeling. I've eyeing really cute Eevee fabric South Korea, shipping would something like $20/yard. price gone I've dilly-dallied buying it. 146 people might well 737 crashing *everyday.* never really protests area. several year. blm marches year, great. nonstop ""Donald"" sympathizers scream idiots marching, black people gives flying f#+k, racism real. . . . .and racist shit give space to. counter protest started endless belly baring, overweight, middle aged, white men misspelling freedom calling masks tyranny shit say governor whitmer.  . . .  insane. young (and older too) people wanted march equality times anti- equality anti science anti reality people screaming fever dream better reality. Stop planet- I'm hopping off. “ flu” I'm hearing lot here. keep telling people, ""Um...you realize that, even school, getting anything approaching normalcy, right? close social interactions all, wearing masks day long?"" 

""But least they're friends!"" Can’t wait see many lawsuits they’re iatrogenic deaths. And, exponential growth occurs, hospital collapse jack IFR significantly. hospital collapse occur, people take precautions socially distance response news hospitals stressed. Guess what? Regardless government policy, people choosing stay home news says hospitals full = bad economy.

Maybe we'll never see hospital collapse. totally ignorant. lived 2019 ""normal"" lives, virus WOULD spread exponentially hospitals WOULD collapse IFR WOULD skyrocket. But, we're idiots. may never happen. However, price paid social distancing, suck. 

So herd immunity policy means, either exponential growth, collapse, death. OR, extreme social distancing things get bad. situations bad lockdown, worse really. there's thing ""nothing do, let rip"" strategy. strategy exist. best aggressively test smart lockdowns, smart advised enforced lockdowns. border controls effective quarantine. better testing. lot. 

We need lockdowns per se, many countries see ""if test positive, must quarantine, give food, leave quarantine premises fined go jail"". seems work better consequences. lockdowns bad, quarantines people proven virus pose threat others, can't see harm. basic function government military. Even Ayn Rand said so.  Saying it’s world wide covers large area redundant. it’s global already implies it’s spread across large area. Exceptional diseases require exceptional response.

And I'm Reddit comment thread place teach technical details vaccines. Please rude me, you.

I provided plenty examples haven't... fact done make unsubstantiated claims, insulted hand wave economic damage caused governments policies.

I think open good faith discussion let's end here. That’s happens contract something vital profiteering farce Serco. It’s “ruinous”. It’s willing defeat pandemic.

”The debt accumulated“. joke? currency. 

You support people government paid wages workers sheltered home made sure business don’t go under. Like civilized nations did. one like using. Specifically Freddie Mercury, since people familiar him. didn’t die AIDS, died got bronchial pneumonia couldn’t fight it. 

I don’t understand people think goes sorts situations. believe doctor writes “AIDS :(“ death certificate? someone gets shot, cause death “gun?” earth would case? region US state this? Backlog-schmacklog. Go eat out, get back work reverse good done lockdown first place. sorry hear that. Peace yours, friend Oh expect throw parties - almost entire society does. risks also quite real young people. Long-term effects leave one chronic fatigue, punctured lungs heart damage. However, get feeling would value elderly person's life less valuable social life young. that's case, discussion futile best. 

And even majority young people. tiny fraction involved reckless behaviour. 

And again, I'm growing tired argue point: nobody asking put social lives hold - asked socialise safe way, e. g. outdoors, taking walk together whatnot. Read comments; people ready go Covid IC unit believing mask protect them. hypothesized (and article backs up)

This article literally hypothesis, voiced someone else. nothing/very little actually backing up.

Don't get wrong, sound could true (and wish was!), simply know yet. It’s needed. need specific rules enforced strictly. Like wearing masks indoors. one obeyed first ""lockdown"" whats point second Yeah, cold week school closed (yes, I'm quite certain garden variety cold- medical issues likely would mean well truly fucked get covid), high school kids actually jumped stared real fear time coughed sniffled.

So, willing make friends dislike rather honest them? That's recipe success. family indicated issue medical insurance travel US. new policies coming cover COVID lot fine details consider. Going file, 'now people tell (covid-19) myth', 'things happen.

What happen moral hazard created government wherein covid-19 hospital scored hospital $.  

And that's fine, surface. moral hazard comes play virtually every death starts getting attributed covid-19 order score sweet covid $.

Dying cancer get exposed covid? Oh, covid death! Morbidly obese + diabetes gets exposed covid? Another covid death!

I’m curious countries equator currently fall/winter, experience massive jumps well? think going get like April either, despite alarmist predictions saying worse case could 10,000 deaths day. I'm like, er, what?

But last time made prediction end March, come close 50,000 deaths April. think like 60,000 month. predict anymore case jinx everything.

(Though like said, think estimates floating IHME way high.) Pretending catch respiratory illness eating ridiculous part. getting heated, think main point everyone trying get across necessary. like saying 'I boiled water want catch Covid'. That's spread need take possible disease preventing measures methods know means transmission here. fine want boil water, need folks defend important step people taking. 40,000 new cases day.


Below 70,000 sure, jeez still extremely high infection rage. 

If America got 200,000 infections day, make 100,000 success forget virus countermeasures back ""Normal"" 5-10 years. think pandemic cause widespread economic destruction felt long time.

Damn

Edit: trump2020 guy seems like jerking goddamn comment section. “Alas, everyone perfect smart me, everything would perfect.” He’s dumbass narcissist. Exactly study. Like it’s worlds apart me, indoor vs outdoor. I’m Canada we’ve issues US Citizens sneaking various entry points spreading virus around. people get reason US cases high compared everyone else’s. Trump, build wall north side please. don’t want here. Hold up. pure evil? he's pure evil? legitimately asking double negatives suck. No, go mainly local tapas places family owned restaurants. Sometimes pubs that’s mood for. constitutes college town? I’m right close Boston. find CDC's statement ""food borne"" kind misleading.

Except misleading, eating inhaling food thing. snort burrito sure, could catch it, tbh immediate problems bunch rice lungs...

It hurt reheat food, reason make others feel like necessary precautions science crystal clear. times did, 2 100 + degrees outside.

The third almost deserted bar, count homeless guy coming though :/ Account created today probably make comment. bond alternative like:

Bond 2 Million spar professional UFC fighter 5 rounds. would someone downvote this!? tragic losing good people every day aware losses many medical professionals, call wear mask honor good thing put there. don’t need explain yourself. wasn’t people eating restaurants, would likely shut good, especially weather getting colder. helped keep business open, good job! can’t wait day vaccine widely available everyone. Unfortunately know everyone take hopefully people do. available though I’m gonna go immediately closest hospital getting vaccine!  Yep, [the cyclical nature hospital stays really apparent graph non-COVID patients see opened elective surgery built up. assume weekends low days, someone scheduled 2-3 day hospital stage planned procedure they'll try go weekend staffing. nailed me! I'm american used roll work around 7:30 go around 9:00 (flex time yes I'm one office)  evidence get infected Covid eating it. small chance get packaging, transfer wash hands, need cook 400 hour person suggested. Covid respiratory gastrointestinal. catch respiratory diseases eating them. Found Day:Zero Troll account .. well might might not. already point really lethal harmful enough threaten survival (which reason viruses tend mutate less deadly forms) I'm side -- thing I'll say quarter Americans voted Trump -- half. :( Dude didn’t even basic flu vaccine 1918. many tools arsenal it’s likely current pandemic won’t last long. Wow. Yes, totally agree. I’m astonished “the dumbness”, sheer ignorance, selfishness ...the lack thinking beyond yourself, “all mentality”. 


It’s mask, don’t want wear mask *your safety, *at least elderly person line next grocery store somebody’s beloved Mom Grandmother, person silently battling cancer workplace, somebody’s Dad, Brother, Grandfather, Uncle, etc. etc. 

I’d feel horrible carrier virus zero symptoms, found could possibly prevented infecting others worn mask work, shopping various unavoidable group settings. 

It’s easy thing do. 
It’s Asshole thing do. Makes quite headline. :/  hard figure out, though. 18-35ish age group likely general. government/doctors/media/etc come really hard group, really frustrating keep hearing someone age bracket literally go all. goes friends.

We're gonna see lot less testing going though, they've made clear. case even understand contract tracing thing point. FDA - Yea stop riots/looters maybe rise. thought testing everyone airport? Sometimes like that. whole country could feeling like Katrina FEMA sub furthest thing dignified, filled negativity, trolls, liars fear mongers. Halloween 🎃 lets hope news spooky Live entertainment associated industries venues. stats: FDA approval least 50% effective. Pretty expected ngl would love go smoke bar sweaty concert strange hand rolled cigarette passed around. major changes still see now. saying never therefore clearly still seeing changes. FYI. re-read think probably right. 0.3 IFR snapshot recent infections extrapolated entire population.

Either way good news IFR recent infections trending down. Though probably also means susceptible people died early pandemic recent infections driven young people. Lesson learnt hard way :) Well, that's pretty genocidal him. Nope. known risk. Well, unless go bankrupt cancel, cancel time July next year (assuming bankrupt) get deposit back -- minus interest, naturally.

It's investment sanity something look forward friends, though. Except, again, necessary accurate data. beginning pandemic, working essentially zero information. idea many infections present currently country, idea fast pathogen spreads, dangerous is, long lasts, many infect, many suspectible it. know, essentially nothing.

So say treating ranch town idaho farm towns like cities wrong, say matter. People travel regularly cities ranch towns farm states visa versa. Family coming one way other, family trips, business trips, name it. know pathogen have, properties are, sensible solution shut everything sembleance idea currently happening.

I agree traveling. Infact i'm infuriated private travels travel tourism currently permitted. That's selfish luxury dumb, impulsive morons prioritizing 'fun' human fucking life. Surprise surprise, lies Trump important science.

Trump cronies enemies science, enemies truth, enemies American lives. Aren’t trolls supposed funny least *some* audience? People said three four months ago. Polling United States shows vast majority population understands long haul. Conceptually, least, we’ve united pandemic would think. considering things mostly back normal 80% people realize covid dangerous they'd led believe, think expectations aligned reality. unless he's threatening impose reality people. meds? 5% doctors, encouraged response driven solely public health considerations standards, turned wrong several important points—most notably mask-wearing asymptomatic spread. treated complex disaster, let expertise disaster planning machinery used furnish immediate crisis response needed? earthquake happens, don’t rely geologists sort dig people rubble. Perhaps disaster planners wouldn’t hung whether randomized controlled trials efficacy mask-wearing suggesting know ya feel way! It’s like Florida. Anti mask don’t give damn, don’t care sick weak bitches eyes many. That’s know picked right side. right isn’t usually fun, make everyone happy side. Keep strong resolve don’t let wear ya down. It’s hard, know, us trying, need keep find second wind! 

These anti maskers anti safety nonsense right drain ya, can’t turn idiocracy. haven’t go watch “The Social Dilemma” it’ll explain lot going society bias cognitive disconnect. work hospital lab. -70 freezer small hell. Think size mini fridge.

We couple -30s size kitchen refrigerator tho

Edit: I’d imagine pharmacy would better equipped sort storage. Idk exactly have, every time pop it’s like getting Fort Knox. It’s newly renovated tho wish could see kind cool stuff cant answer question? wont fit doomsday narrative huh? Cheap

USA Pharmaceuticals : Allow us introduce debate here: pure blood French Canadian...


I'm surprised yet suggested brown star serial number tattoo ""these people"".


I always wonder criteria be: outsider ancestors 3 generations? Religious orthodoxy? DNA test?


Maybe proof cognitive purity, like exam. Extra points homophobic sexist general population. 


So, yes, see ""cultural purity"" appealing... (used racial purity, went fashion...) Anybody else notice fact kids team already testing positive showing every symptom covid send daughter swim lessons? I've decided origin story Planet Apes. Again, UK media using “teenager” refer fully grown adult? It’s technically true conjures image 13-year old getting slapped £10k fine instead grown issued consequence actions. Everyone ready done virus. get it. done us. boss invited bunch us activity weekend eat dinner afterward hard delicate turn down. thing is, everyone thinks I'm insane this, feel safe sitting table mask on, surrounded half dozen coworkers, also wearing masks, quarantine. Outside not. Burning world goal ""accelerationists"". believe total destruction needed rise ashes stronger like phoenix. tend believe end pile shit future generations need clean long long time (assuming recover all). Time vote people constructive productive outlook life. Meh. I'm driving 3 places one run I'd rather leave on. Plus good example people wearing mask big hardship. Well good news!

So need vaccine anymore worry anti-maskers, pro-maskers immune, problems solved! change come today, tomorrow. come need buy food, come rent due. 

What now?  I'm working student got stimulus check... parents would tell fuck right asked pay 10k fine. heart defo it. bet people fat, strain health system. pretty pathetic see people's prejudice appear called genuine concern, really idiotic hypocritical I've lost faith American public. aunt uncle died COVID, family STILL thinks overblown. think way Trump would actually take seriously got himself. Probably though. mean Herman Cain died barely mentioned it, even think mentioned died COVID. Republicans decided completely ignore cause death went narrative ""it's cold libs"". Herman Cain still somehow manages tweet COVID disinformation beyond grave. Stopped eating meat due COVID, I’m done since 6 months ago. People don’t deserve die communicable disease destroy local families eat steak. worth it. heard trump said tape last week, nobody supporting said. shows type people do.  right: vaccine given millions people sorts states health, one know every adverse side effect new medicine might cause.

And unlike medicine meant cure / alleviate illness, standard vaccines far higher given healthy people.

That said, big drug companies leading vaccines other, successful, established profitable products would tainted, even ruined botched Corona vaccine. 

So, strictly interests, careful humans ensure vaccine rolled wider public meet safety standards. reason decided to? Hm well makes sense! server eating, means shouldn'tt wear mask they're around SERVING I'm eating.

Do realize fucking selfish sounds? called decent. know sick not, please wear goddamn mask server near you. least could do, considering stay restaurants anyway. Yep. watching Netflix’s Social Dilemma, know whatever shown doesn’t fit worldview fake algorithm keeps showing want see. 

Death common sense. Deluded. Granted little National leadership Ok? I'm arguing you. buckled well aware everything said. Thanks sharing. Nah, actually fourth offence. Hopefully police keep though.


I'm guessing well course. downvote might stumbled ass backwards herd immunity said quick estimate, math [what CDC currently estimating fatality rate per below. 

""0.003% children 18 younger infected coronavirus die.""

""The fatality rate 0.02% people aged 20 49.""

""0.5% people aged 50 69.""

""5.4% people 70 older.""

Then plug [census demographics. gives below, number people demographics expected die infected covid.

Less 18: 74000000*0.00003=2,220

20-49: 112000000*0.0002=22,400

50-69: 81000000*0.005=40,500

70+: 40000000*0.054=2,160,000

The sum 2.58 million. 2.58 million 0.8% total population data 308 million (2010's population). So, population demographics unchanged since 2010, fatality rate would 0.8%, **13 times deadly .06** quoting.

That's also assuming population 2010 elderly 2020, likely not. Boomers probably pushed 40 million higher, saying 1% fatality rate 2020 difficult picture.

edit: 70+ demographic jumped 10 million 2010-2020, 2000-2010, puts fatality rate almost exactly 1%. hope joke. people care says fired medical bills? percentage think hospitalized covid? 

Also, know much costs train new person vs retain current? Business 101. Also, many places work magical thing called sick leave pto yeah. need least 100K respondents prove anything. sucks went comedy club last night regret it. go unless feel safe so. people taking precautions going movies again, thought going comedy club would okay. mean patrons taking proper precautions business enforcing like say website right? LMAO. Wrong. People wore masks bathroom never point wear masks table. I'd pull mine sipped drink. also customer saw wore gloves too. tables also close together. social distancing measure all; slightly less congested club last time went. spacing tables seating basically small restaurant. I'm anything like there's vaccine.   THANK. YOU. read 4 times really marinate mind ♡ So, daughter away college. Mostly online, classes.

She's new roommate month. Today find roommate tested positive Covid-19.

Yesterday, hosted family in-laws anniversary. We're conscious getting sick - they're 80+ - see them, wear masks, keep well-distanced.

Our dining table seats 14, 9 dinner, able keep distance one another, keeping in-laws far end away us.

My daughter sat me, cousin thick thieves, somewhere dinner chatting.

My daughter seen roommate couple weeks, contact usually brief, distanced.

She's got rapid test appointment Tuesday, know minutes positive.

Because part time nanny two small children, got tested weeks ago started working family, tested negative.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions many: chances exposed? share bathroom kitchen. see often, common area apartment share.

&amp;#x200B;

Should entire family get tested immediately, wait Tuesday get results? tests negative? even exposed that's case?

I'm asking come home while, matter what. roommate family nearby, going quarantine apartment. daughter could possibly stay boyfriend (yay) lives complex. tested negative weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Even exposed last night, test week show anything negative?

&amp;#x200B;

When get tested, all?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry litany questions, Sunday afternoon, doctor available. Think many people would died massive meat shortage. Hell almost lost half US population great toilet paper depression March 2020. way! Texas state government best! bigglierest! Even one tried disperse first. issued fine abused call backup. knowing that, say different mechanism? think clear already many differences COVID known known coronavirus. also several distinct strains way mutates contact trace it. agree saying.

A second example would hepatitis DNA virus replicates via RNA. sage advice W.H.O offered us historic pandemic? 

... Ebola CV-19 Possibly best advice I've given ♡ face consequences. wanting haw dime interpretation individual words.

Let's cut BS, South Korea's cases increased people letting guard returning normal life. Full Stop. 
Yes. challenge, know, I'm friggin' epidemiologist. virus disappear hits outdoor air.

If large crowd, odds good crowd infected.

If pack crowd together tightly extended periods, infections spread within crowd.

The virus care gathered together. factors count proximity time spent proximity.

If protest keeping 12 feet/ 4 meters apart everyone else, feel free. won't. 60% kid cases asymptomatic Apparently PCSO's originally attended best break party get everyone disperse, abused call ""actual"" police. point, really anyone blame themselves. word dictionary paigan, google meant get shot in. used example government passing every opportunity would much effective. WHO's job enforce anything, non-point.

Yes, advised travel ban. Director said patient re-infection first affected Covid-19 six weeks ago. “He recovered treatment (but) developed symptoms depresses seeing disrespect safety teachers.  important people society opinion treated such. friend whose wife teacher many parents expect completely charge getting kids educated parental involvement all. Part parenting making sure kids behave, respect teachers get homework projects done get home. teachers can't, alone. area least paid fairly well per year also work lot hours per day. work end school day ends. Without teachers educated adults, without educated adults workforce.  Yeh, there's effective vaccine, maybe. not, six years would optimistic. needs money muscle.

WHO needs massive overhaul completely new management team. confuse potential world health organization reality WHO.   Honestly, one big convenience us citizen. passport get somewhere warm. law supposed starting Monday? Dude. way you’re getting outta without hug right back. son’s name? Good point. 200,000 deaths US. That's 0.06% population. 77,570 meat plant workers according 0.25% population. 4x increase. consider demographics. one hand, yeah probably meat plant workers greater risk exposure white-collar workers. hand, meat plant workers much younger median age death, thus much smaller risk dying.

I'd imagine age socioeconomics since age predominant factor COVID risk. we're looking *minimum* 4x increased risk, probably something closer \~10x account age brackets socioeconomically-matched population.

So one order-of-magnitude larger risk. That's pretty large. pretty clear working meat packing plants carries increased risk death. think democrats room talk 5 governor's sent infected elderly back nursing homes killing thousands. it’s dominated women.

That’s it. first place customers. rather see unemployed. scumbags

Get grip crowd? hell talking about?

The virus spread outdoor masked protests. Period. fact blathering change. Seattle tested protesters free MONTHS protests found appreciable transmission.

Your chances actually catching outside masked nearly nil. argue otherwise completely ignore evidence, studies basic common sense. first thought reading headline : ""where America eat monkeys? "" Every move took late forced public opinion ironic westerners trying demolish postwar global institutions countries steep decline need convenient scapegoats.

I tend agree. predominantly basing decisions advice empirical scientific advice studies.

This great, actually worked, problem discourse along lines ""we evidence confirm this"", equally evidence disprove it.

They essentially non-committal. 

I likened guy crows nest ship. shout alarms think can, however able steer ship make ultimate decisions. Captain Helmsman's decision.

The fact USA knew CV19 airborne transmissible around start February suggests Governments knew yet finger pointed fumbling around white coats trying prove true. 

The village idiot face covering soon China locked city millions it.

I increasingly concerned cognitive logic ability politicians. respectability politics? made blanket statement think true. protesters advocating change rioters. Sometimes people always. rioters opportunistic using current situation go cause trouble. sow chaos discord discredit protestors. value freedom health life day. lot reading 1918-1919 pandemic despite war censorship really working (word still got around back then; newspapers overtly political rags nobody entirely trusted) LOT people either didn’t know didn’t think pandemic even happened many years later.

If think perspective individual fog war can’t really see half mile aren’t going much awareness something like unless touches family.

For purpose really think put webcams ICUs ERs show people dying television. Otherwise people don’t get - way treat disease much like sanitize meat production west. see PPE high tech hospital beds respirators things dehumanize technologize actual suffering going real people.

In Asia often show scooter car accidents television end newscast, like sort blooper reel cartoon sound effects layered someone getting crushed bus running red light, losing control motorcycle falling construction site. first time saw horrified eventually realized probably prevents accidents.

Similarly Chinese broadcast state executions past. think certain extent something going happen people allowed know barest details. wind dying covid I’ll everything document document event online. I’m going part. Look Walgreens. They’ve got locations give day PCR test results. Say you’ve got scratchy throat (and doesn’t crappy air quality US aight now?) wish could give one upvote. needs top. Seriously student human job educate consequences types actions. teach reasoning, deduction critical thinking colleges anymore? rules everyone consequences publicly announced. actions different anyone choses speed, choses drink drive choses wear seatbelt. fact, think actions even worse. consequences grave. He's basically making decision someone drinks drives. selfish idiot. punished that. Would defend got car drunk smashed car damaged property injured people? really understand defending this, unless think OK. condone points seriously huge problem college student society. pay healthcare Indigent taxes.. pay twice much would single-payer healthcare. Hospitals get reimbursed uninsured patients tax breaks write-offs. pay Indigent Health Care. None us dumb us. Server actively eating drinking they? Easy. Give hundred million years started crazy shit. wouldn’t say YET though. based timing comment. agree likeliness COVID spread around party someone likely die soon MK ultra came light, Watergate ironically partially due Watergate. NYT caught wind documents ordered destroyed, many survived purge improperly stored labeled, result many people involved.

It much can't vast conspiracy lot people moving parts, simply odds discovered conspiracy ruined exposed grow exponentially person, continued energy resources needing conceal it. conceals something scale worldwide pandemic unfathomable. would require talent, resources, personnel focus, anyone capable could simply overtly subjugate world.  deny people platform talk. 
Free speech....the government must support that, us non government platforms. 

Ban deniers. Good claim quoted above. I'm sure trying change now, unless trying weasel admitting proof claim. leaves losses completely uninsured though. current system private insurance make low Medicare reimbursement coupled reimbursement uninsured. completely remove uninsured element, lot money coming offset lower Medicare reimbursement. Ultimately, taxes go up, preferably disproportionately affecting ultra wealthy. current system isn’t working need most. take notice rest world operates play little catch up. true. But, can't even deal idiots anymore. I'm registered nurse can't even begin tell many times talk sick people deny coronavirus even exists. think does? twice many people dying isnt bad news, exactly it? I'm concerned predictions reality pretty major concern.  virus spreads crowds gathered together.

The virus disappear hits outdoor air.

And supposed proof protests asserts protesters lead increased social distancing among non-protesters modify behavior response protests, protests spread virus.  

If blow red light others around avoid colliding you, make great driver.

Downvoting change reality, either. virus likes crowds, including yours. Power man! I’m boat, people see world black white. It’s sort unfortunate necessity want bring drugs market sooner, all, given ethics first animal trials humans. Coronavirus finds fucks wife wife falls love leaves die alone? Yep I'm talking brick wall suspected.


The police statement said using full powers make point. quite likely second offence. Or... wear mask server thing? really cannot make sacrifice little inconveniences eaitng, don'tt go fucking eat. forgot add: Goverment cooking numbers deaths/infected people make em look good enough least tourists summer beceause goverment desperated get fresh cash...

Im guessing rest european countries same. Spain. Right? Ye, sure.

Part third world country thinking way better really every country do. US, funding/compulsorily attendance started give equal footing development rhe workforce. around Great Depression graduation moved 12th bc ""children"" competing lower wage vs adult would paid higher. opinion necessity college degrees another way reset work force start age. History Channel awesome documentary it. 

However, first funded school 1635 high schools built 1910s.

Edit: clarification students known going happen stayed fuck campus. also suckers equation pay tuition something they're going get. 
So sure colleges enabling big picture capitalism problem college problem.  well sucks control group N95, N99, N100 fully protect wearer. confounds people aren’t wearing type. soon  people 70 death rate practically 1 5 according last stats saw difference neither big sellers vs items using packaging.. faced packaging issues, companies focus getting products sell better. provincial health officer B.C. refused mandate masks time - even cases skyrocketing.

She’s highly decorated field oversaw SARS outbreak Toronto among things yet still doesn’t think mandatory masks necessary right now...

It’s pretty divisive area... Look assholes started wildfire Cali part gender reveal. They’ll prob get put probation best. It’s joke. I've heard, biggest risk somebody coughing enter bus. Hopefully plastic dividers now. think many parents don’t care kids mild cases, parents concerned children’s health rather own. Also parents minor kids usually high risk group. parents kids seeing grandparents pandemic parents feel comfortable letting kids go daycare (especially working) see friends. I’m saying right placing judgement trying give explanation parents thinking. realized logic speaking close friend handling pandemic differently are. inability grok answers strikes personal failing less failings others. Although completely wrong COVID ""about deadly less compared common flu"", flu sucks ass mind wearing mask crowded areas like bus post-COVID. Sure, let's look last graph example. respondents allowed indicate they're trouble multiple ways. household could trouble paying credit cards, *and* paying rent, *and* paying utilities, counted categories. percentages end category essentially saying, respondents, X percent trouble way. Hope clears things up! went doctor, said could take mask appointment wanted to. veterinarian, hand, wonderful careful.  I’m funeral biz swear never heard wailing gnashing teeth till governor mandated masks you’re place work. want ex-royalty $100-million Netflix deal. :)  Get test three days, you’ll know what—that they’re prisoners?  guarantee every person would reaction it. I've friends got staying home others get admitted hospital age group Write Funny mention that. Technically, normal meaningless word. Signed vaccine clinical test Pfizer past Tuesday. I'm hoping good helps get info need keep train rolling. knows, vaccine may closer think. Hitler innocent. /s Could be, actually met anyone wear mask everyone around wears them. maybe right real life experience anti maskers.

I think must left wing media telling lies sadly fallen for....yet again. moral hazard lie masks. always thought would effective preventing spread others, appreciate much would prevent catching it. Time put money gold, someone's idea art. agree general.

Also,

!RemindMe! 2 months Better bring motherfucking ruler social distancing rides wear full body ppe body suit. Remember 4x's high    It’s tragedy surgeon general people discouraged people US wearing masks. Anti-intellectualism problem much every factor. country, reaching (what hope is) peak right now. work (grocery store) required wear masks times us wear back. usually one does. Reddit, say like. way people disagree want. Sure, wear masks anyway, potential good news help enforce it. won’t get world status/reputation back another couple generations, ever. know someone similar work anti-mask. found out, really confused. still am. would still then, now, later. going away. hate Trump, misplaced. Nothing stop COVID-19 except herd immunity, herd immunity come us exposed. respond??

Also: I’m sorry! That’s awful. wouldn’t able focus conversation :-/ hope said ""no, take mask off"". Close, suppository. tried Thieves Oil? Wisconsin Iowa; I've seen like 4 marks total rural parts 8 days travel stay Well knows....it may different....we never know. Ahh yes, typical canuck fashion yo nice. Sorry misunderstanding. Right? People forget basics needs -- actual perceived ones. 

I'd bet republicans planned take popularity hit extending unemployment precisely speed demand reopening. else would sow dissension working class often urban, young, minorities well? 

That's US. Good luck getting poorer country hold long haul even wealthier ones unless get economy close enough back parity keep floating all. Vitamin C cures cancer opposite schedule north. follows seasonal calendar. people live northern hemisphere December winter affect numbers June winter. vets live curb side. Although, let us come back masks private room kitty put sleep summer, grateful for! Shut fuck , piece absolute garbage would Biden done differently? say racist? far remember American press saying that. countries cases shut thier citizens travelling? fewer cases covid ever before. mortality rate also going down. **not** rounding corner? Fuck. sentence heartbreaking see. Sorry guys put shit :( US Military still get smallpox vaccines. Though think related less lethal version (cowpox iirc). Still sucks, still leaves scar, still spread (by touch) can't get someone live vulnerable. everyone gets deploy go Korea get case biological warfare. may created confusion, highly doubt that’s reason anti-maskers refuse wear mask. It’s convenient excuse cite. 

Have talked people? There’s reasoning them.

EDIT: We’ve six months, it’s like CDC telling us wear masks. reversed course shortly initial statement enough research experts telling us wear masks. 

There excuses one blame right wing media politicizing masks people lack critical thinking skills see past that. will. People followed quarantine want others virus government better job educating people risks keep people informed facts science, month realized planned differently. Reading response loud hilarious. Jolly good. yes we've 2 depressions thirds ? never take normal things granted ever again. Good Google/YouTube. Facebook took responsibility country would better off...

And article two sound like bunch entitled pricks. agree - I’m close giving FB IG shit. seeing people celebrating kids’ birthdays parties masks distancing, seeing people spread fake bullshit news like 6% death thing, arguing family can’t handle kids want back in-person school sports....it’s mentally exhausting I’m sure handle anxiety stress anymore. 

People shits. grandpa, dude dick. That's awful. say? get herd immunity? exposure. done well reducing this, going away. long hide wait, coming matter way us develop herd immunity? I've read drive-in movies apparently coming back. Never actually heard one happening, though. knew wearing masks deadly, global pandemic could *good* thing! Crazy! think Americans less masks, compared countries. free press sometimes go overboard reporting stories attract attention. press countries may able report people wearing masks. New Hampshire here. totally demographic thing. Joe Sixpack construction job, there's way wearing mask. Pampered housewife food co-op masked hand sanitizer every pocket. 

My wife avoid places used enjoy demographic mask-friendly. average US, high everywhere else. can. friends China (international students) asking ""Are politicians anti-mask China wore them?"". Take guess... cdc came beginning recommended masks would reduced number people putting fight.

Not president politicizing it, still. Strong venn diagram r/ conspiracy wish best!  :) laws Canada also hate masks. mother law even said doesn’t always wear one people look funny wants cough sneeze them. They’re 65 cancer, heart inflammation sorts issues. idiocy astounds me. And, Trump voters, early 50s. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Strawberries super fruit! Honest question: stop staring directly sun? mean steparents stepbrothers! :) statistic applies me. still live ex boyfriend divorcorona-ed. day toughest lonely day lived. Ow. Ow. Please let vet know switching. ♥️♥️

Americans tend much loving face-to-face us. pleasure here.  moved back mom, started skateboarding, playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater compulsively again. Pretty close. Fuck tiny bullhorn Alex problem.  I'm cautious.  told parents visit.  wife's responsible want hear pay attention people making things worse dragging mess on.  

She really misses friends social takes me.  blames me, least partially.  rough. Get javacript extension easily turn off. Assumptions, assumptions. stats remove high risk people. Even extended family, almost everyone older brother high risk. Cancer survivors, people autoimmune disease, T2 diabetes, someone g6pd (similar sickle cell disease), pregnancy, etc... 

 mind also death bad outcome. want long-term chronic illness result covid. ever ability? youtube channel? Yup, since February 28th exact. 
About masks: area lot elderly wear masks think hoax peddle sentiment grandmother hard even go buy groceries. Restaurants owned follow rules all, tables far enough placed people walk by, speak Spanish talked friends work servers tell scary stories managed. 
And people think ok go lives.

It's ok, I'm looking forward leaving country clearly safe us. Clearly lot americans care themselves. also left vet similar reason. She’s treated pets even worked 4 years. She’s amazing vet. posted Facebook kids need go back school it’s case sniffles.

I just... can’t. disappointed. link exactly article criticizing. non peer-reviewed article written economists, epidemiologists, using methodology making assumptions criticized many. actual real evidence linking single case rally paper. way better testing now. Like myself, 7 months getting it, still cant walk stairs without breath.

Long term issues joke it.  way way way better testing now. Previously impossible unless needed go hospital. get slight symptoms. cases previously detected. way smaller second wave make be. Case point, medical system leaves us rest world agog guys perpetual event horizon bankruptcy worse.  work there's certain type demograph claim masks work.  long term damage? please elaborate really break US least two separate countries. ultimate Red vs Blue speak. everybody needs vaccinated, start vaccinate majority transmission rate drops drastically, second wave afford vaccinate many people without fearing second wave. Especially time comes we'll hopefully much faster testing times better isolation policies arise. thing ""is hoax"" ""don't panic"" right. way better testing now. Many ppl would never tested April May. It’s way control. Look numbers hospitalisations critically ill. spoke Doctor friend Madrid. coping well worried moment. People cruises allowed get Antarctica think. sail like point ""there is!""... Antarctica pristine environment much possible. Believe various laws designed try &amp; maintain way. completely agree you, made one good point. However, point could conveyed public education. anti-masking propaganda! 

The average American doesn’t know wear mask way that’s effective. 

TLDR- do/not mask

I’ll use Dad example. (Sorry Dad, you’re much protect me, I’m immuno-compromised, yourself).

The mask correct size, sealed tightly possible, reach bridge nose beneath chin. (Dad wears mask that’s small, slips middle nose creates gap side it).

The mask, it’s standard surgical style mask, pulled tightly enough far enough chin doesn’t flap around sides create big gaps either side mouth. (Dad flapping much may take flight).

Reusing masks doesn’t help all, unless committed keeping clean possible, either cleaning reusable ones, disposable ones, working rotation give pathogens time die, using ultra-violet sanitizer. (Dad wears filthy mask every day).

Once mask on, don’t touch it, don’t touch face. Don’t move around scratch nose, adjust day long. touch it, clean hands after. Otherwise you’re transferring bacteria hands mask face, combo. (Dad create dance called Mask, can’t keep hands it).

Don’t pull mask cough sneeze. makes completely pointless. (I don’t need example here).

Lastly, eat drink around people wearing mask, don’t take off, don’t loop around chin. safest way, wear clean mask normally, clean hands, pull bottom mask up, exposing mouth, take bite sip, immediately pull chew, swallow, exhale. Make sure exhale move take sip/bite, pull back breathing again. (Dad either takes off, loops around chin).

Those bunch reasons given masks “wouldn’t effective”. general, something still better nothing- people quickly learn properly use mask! 

But they’re much effective used correctly, can’t expect people outside medical community know things. Instead implying “people stupid right, bother?”, widespread focus educating society mask hygiene. 

If they’d put much effort education waffling, assuming Americans dumb learn, people would wearing masks more, would using safest effective way possible.

If already know this, you’re great, I’m trying patronize you. people never taught, would like protect others using mask fullest potential.

Love hope good health all. ❤️ acedemic opinion piece NEJM, study like hypothesis noted expert.

Stated OP TLDR. references someone need disprove opinion piece? researcher one opinion, us. want fact. Nothing article proven. 

If say fairies garden see heck would say disprove me. would assume I'm crazy hell. person stating something prove others. 

Please look scientific method cause I'm pretty sure taught elementary school. It’ll months yet first priority vulnerable get it. sure it’ll widely accessible would guess year real vaccine virus met along way. ""No thanks. decisions making flawed directly affect employees' welfare?"" 80 times less leathel seems? Could might ,should be..... proof study? defiant, hearsay atm unfortunately know doctor worked hospital Durban first peak S.A. test results delayed multiple weeks, places even month long backlog. told person comes hospital dies, cause death changed death certificate already put system. One man came pneumonia, died 4 days later. Cause death death certificate put pneumonia put system such. Later finally got results back tested positive. cause death absolutely covid, death certificate day unchanged. said much job go back rectify every single death certificate already system considered finalized. Logistically doable. wonder many countries case. Free Covid, great. Till ice sheets melt, releasing cache million-year old viruses onto unprepared humankind. Anti Vaxx: told so!! That’s thing though—you great, catch virus. You’ve lucky far, ain’t proof won’t get sick. You’re playing Russian roulette lot empty chambers. numbers based way better testing. March April may, super hard get tested. need cough test you. friend symptoms slight cough loss sense smell. Spain 10 times many infected first wave. Also wait till see updated numbers next Friday. curve dropping. People different Europe. broke quarantine order, symptoms, infected god knows many. consequences her? Nothing. Absolutely zero. Humans everywhere, see consequences actions, knowingly harm others care all.

Check people ordered quarantine, break quarantine go out, fine 2,000 dollars. Problem solved. can't tell much spineless "" Dear Madam/Sir, could please allowed dare maybe suggest maybe consider staying home next week really going inconvenience you, would nice you. Thanks. "" angers me. There's gap 'back normal' 'total lockdown'. Yes. That's still 50% reduction garbage fire going now. Bring on. Let's see list? High worse New Zealand Denmark? 

Things pretty nice big brother democracy paving way ensuring free trade you.  Gravity also theory.

In scientific method, things referred theories. mean act according best, current understanding given theory. bc additional findings made, theories adjusted &amp; modified.

All know sure is, I'll continue masking.  called government seem get memo order enough tests, dismantled Nightingale hospital told everyone go get pissed go back work school.  TIL... George Washing factoid fascinating be. NEJM scientific journal, recognizes complexity uncertainty. Nobody knows, nobody **can** know. somebody tries say 'so month' present state knowledge speaking nonsense perhaps lying. real. People upvote title even OP top comment thread states opinion piece proven hypothesized one researcher. That's all. Talk total utter misinformation. Anyone hypothesis, 0 scientific backing based guess people voting crap. wonder information spreads easily. Bit rude mate We're supposed check staff temperatures temp gun come work, one does. 

Hasn't debunked? gym chain stopped. They've stated chain total 85,000 tests, 2 people temperature, 2 tested negative covid. Alternatively, since would never visit again, less likely affected argument vet could possibly changed mind. It’s theory.

So gravity. Hang there! Honestly, people say ""it's flu"" never flu like I've flu. miserable. sorry hard time getting thru Covid symptoms. People know take things seriously easy forget actually feels like sick feeling nice healthy. get sick, oh no... fucking terrifying; especially novel virus. Wishing speedy recovery! Argh, hate pedantic inoculation cowpox, vaccination mention previous sentence. Inoculation vaccination interchangeable all, there's crucial epidemiological difference. soon somebody found guilty crime like blocked future NHS care feel like actually benefited social anxiety times I'm used going anywhere. Oh wow, watched date documentary.  takes 30 days, withdrawals include migraine-pain level headaches.' like anything important worry /s Humans humans. least could well-informed humans. understand many people struggle grasp this. Even people dying, one thing absolutely require economy function properly first place, stability. country gets sent flat spin something, address it, destroying stability country, cannot properly functioning economy destabilized country. Furthermore, let's suppose global market choice business employ workers import goods country absolutely rotten virus vs country less control. think going get business? infected ass country, safer one? Hellish work culture sounds pretty bad, would say worse even 20% countries. thought going spread Losto Huggin’ Bear back Sunnyside Daycare! Things looking Spinal cord issues? BS asymptotic spread known early on. followed Wuhan shut down. like masks especially cold weather. Morning walks feel like warm pillow face. Serious question, couple n95 masks bought years ago first major fires caused low air quality. start wearing regular masks instead? Lockdowns where? Finally good news Looks like another Reddit scientist lads knows Fauci children die car accidents flu they’re christian - lots kids - home schoolers - kinda assumed might “anti vax”

im confused possibly confused. 3 obvious signs Variolation term applies smallpox it? Smallpox (!) caused Variola virus. Variolation one type inoculation, others different diseases.

Source: I've Jenner's house, museum subject.  chance illness however cut half. I'm grateful hear trying things right. take deep breaths hear care facilities providing PPE actively discouraging it. would easy utterly lose shit. places need taking contagious disease precautions.... We've relaxed little bit much, especially France. Summer time months lockdown, bars restaurants opened, good weather. did? See friends family. course (I'm first guilty). Even work: want keep strict distances long run Latin country eating together important moment day.

Well ended two months everybody travelling across whole country, virus splat everywhere hundreds clusters.

Also: test way before. Probably many cases first wave, except cases first wave undetected officially counted. brother COVID, suffered lot, still fully recover months, never counted, it, tests kept people critical condition hospitals. Ofcourse knew. emphasise word novel. enough reason cautious dealings. recent news suggests, absolutely reduces rate infection. think, however, people would prefer without them. months ago tried joke saying people I'd meet' ""Nínhao, huānyíng lái dào wuhàn"" (Hello, welcome Wuhan). Nobody appreciated humor. gnashing teeth

thanks specific biblical reference starting masking sooner most. educated friends telling “masks don’t help” based early advice. think initial confusing messaging helped contribute anti-mask nonsense. 

I always socially distanced. use Facebook social media. always skeptical American news information. Wearing masks logical conclusion even early January February. Skepticism good bullshit filter. Doctors affected higher rate general population, judging deaths European countries. may higher rate ofinfectionis countered lower viral dose due PPE. would find new one that's things right, switching. family whose members choose associate = broken family.

In first sentence, make point ""broken family"" better hateful one, next sentence say broken families exist. Families coming 'all shapes sizes' related whether still behave family unit. Masks WORK.  Czech Republic 150 new cases per million per day. Individuals responsible spreading disease half-wit. must held responsible actions. 

This trend believing personal wants needs important group ignorant, dangerous basically lie.

Spock said best: “the needs many outweigh needs few...or one.” would correlate local media says said internationally. mask requirements exist many countries. lend credence they're lying things prove happened video evidence, really favour also support figures chinese everyone knows fraudulent experimente exposing people small covid dose every days week see people build immunity. Then, people become contaminators case, somehow replicate experience experimente ? 

I know done back day USA unprofessionaly done, bad medical care virus dangerous. modern day history lessons justice effective disinformation still imagine totality defence opening schools regions, half-assed measures. hope wrong, looks like disaster waiting happen. week I'll start teaching face face university. think I'll wear goggles apart good mask, might become laughing stock students care less. gonna get little bit covid, Stan. Tell mom it’s okay lost minds toilet paper think hoard masks knew protected us? Please.

Still excuse disinformation mistakes, way earth Americans greedy bastards. Great. stop wearing masks? sheep Idiot Americans - say American. biggest assholes planet biggest asshole planet elected president biggest bunch idiots planet.

America falling, falling hard thanks fat, traitorous scumbag office right now. Well, that's stating obvious. Still find depressing people willing spend ton money generate ton waste rather put little effort washing diapers. one know % chance contract virus interaction one wear one ? Restaurants closed 22 (never restaurant past that), bars closed 22 well? eat restaurant, go bar afterwards, party 50 people private location. measures joke. Likewise  No. obliged self isolate test result known. recklessly endangered people actions. says article wishes people would go hospital see themselves. many others cannot wrap minds around people *do want to* know truth. anything keep false reality. isn’t right them. It’s comfortable now. course healthy lifestyle relevant, relatively healthy 100 (e.g. able walk) quite uncommon think people expect good chance achieving it. Apart caring body mind, grandmother probably good genes. hope stay healthy many years! Meanwhile politicians NWT want spend $86M 150 person COVID secreteriat continue restrictions we've active cases 5 months, total 5 cases 0 deaths. That's makes theory theory. establishing form experiment treat hypothesis fact prove wrong/fail prove right Yep, that's I'm saying. smallpox vaccine (which said too) tried clarify smallpox _virus_ live-injected, similar live virus would trigger needed immune response. point part injecting tiny amounts LIVE virus make people immune. bit nutty.

Shes fucking idiot. rational United States sanctions countries like Cuba Iran middle pandemic? Yet rest world content let Americans whatever want, without suffering consequences. 

Where human rights organizations condemning United States sanctions? news reporting condemning America? Sorry, downvote deceptive title.

Does help? Yes.

Does make immune? No. Cardiac arrest due hyperkalemia due renal failure due multi organ failure context end stage pancreatic cancer...

More often chain reaction describe many jurisdictions narrative death certificates put 4-5 various issues different timelines, case seconds, hours days, days weeks, months+ similar.

Sorry loss Says one using word ""cringey"" according article. Read beyond first paragraph.

End 1st paragraph: 

""Known pneumothorax, condition typically affects tall young men older patients severe underlying lung disease.""

2nd paragraph:

""During pandemic, team University Cambridge Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust, observed several patients Covid-19 developed punctured lungs, **even though fall either two categories.**""

That said, say older, chances surviving lot higher, still get it.  dunno, directly contradicts Facebook doctors saying, don’t know trust days /s Lie... US done poorly pandemic would farcical painful. president lying epidemiological experts lying information always going treated much suspect. Good grief people stupid. Selfish stupid morons. Oh look someone Q shirt, would guessed. 

**Facepalm** Shocking /s People suspected while. Doctors seemingly got sick took larger viral dose, larger viral load body. barely public then, always wearing mask, take small viral dose, tiny viral load. Obviously anyone breaking rules punished, saying someone got away give right endanger people's lives get away it. Okay love miss school......that mean safe go back. always get want, especially public health stake. I'm always amazed selfish impatient people kids taught common decency. Considering what's happening Europe, think northeast due second wave. know lot northeastern governors distance learning smart. looking CDC mobility data saw spike recreational activity almost large one 4th July. Coronavirus also passed fecal matter flush toilet atomizes content toilet rises least three feet surface water would face height. Probably good idea wear mask around toilet people use honest even pandemic. fReEdOm!?!!!????!!!??!!?????!!?? Quite true, it’s theory, consider cost benefit ratio, many cases face masks buy one hospital stay intensive care. Even 50% effectivity, it’s still damm bargain economically. human terms, it’s lives! it’s like herpes flares spread does. Well I'm sure pandemic show requiring extra equipment delaying elective procedures really throws budget whack adding expenses removing revenue streams time. situation government stepped procure distribute supplies instead leaving everything free market. think unreasonable medical facilities want price gouged basic protective equipment everything suddenly thrown doubt once. don’t know relapse better reinfection. prevent reinfection, can’t prevent relapses.  50% effectiveness mean 50/50 all-or-nothing immune response. means administered vaccine large group people, expect half many later test positive disease gave placebo. tell severe infectious cases (usually significantly less). live Midwest I’ve noticed past weeks people stopped wearing masks. would say probably 3/10 people using masks. Yeah, trust PhD researcher whose career analyzing differences genetic sequences you, thanks. Imagine US national mandatory mask mandate beginning competent leader set positive example entire Nation.

Yes, understand shortage early on, even Fauci one point said go buy masks medical professionals needed even more, things could different competent leader, country greatest technological advances production capabilities defense production act could invoked, stockpiles maintained. They're saying it. change bed linens. Shit scary man. I've gastrointestinal problems since February GP told gastritis due stress anxiety said seeing lot patients recently. could stress maybe long covid case. France feel we’ve already beat virus one wears masks anymore What's reason wearing mask? I'll go November 7th then. cover us. Interesting question, could fact still mask mandate, could difference testability, could guys already way herd immunity heavily populated areas,could US overall less densely populated lot people sort naturally distanced. 

I'm enough knowledgeable America measures place give good comparison.

What ís case though little amount sick people one spreading event easily big part new cases, hence increasing R short while, whereas higher numbers specific spreading events less impact effective R skies crazy, aren’t they?!? Wednesday dark day around 430 pm...car pelted ash last week! Thats fucking no.

Snitches get stitches highly doubt that. Actually, I’m pretty sure people tested positive base also DoD civilians, actually soldiers. So, Canada jump bizarre conclusions, IRB/IACUC research paused changing procedure. big deal all, happens frequently range reasons. could worked company producing drugs IRB IACUC? can't believe anyone actually considers haha. disproved flu virus healthy adults giving range virus still contracted virus, similar amounts system produced infection. lead large information asymptomatic people virus effects people differently.  


For record, masks work, seems thread keep information released CDC. Please stop saying 'whilst.' super cringey. Could space rock too. sayin. I’ve suspected long time now, reading much science could manage last months.

Keep wearing masks, people. others somewhere middle.
Masks giving ""immunity"" ridiculous masks killing people. people die lockdowns virus Idk, live LA don’t notice much difference mask on. still comes sides not. myth unless happened them. Belief vs facts tough situation modern times. seems never get away belief systems affect whole society negative way. thought grew older would happen, wrong. difference belief facts. data showing asymptomatic leads asymptomatic. 

You say contagious like it’s bad thing worked hotel know girl. Fwiw, correct American civilian living Germany working U.S. DoD. Oh jeez dude. I've enough spam. get it. religiously opposed possibility came lab. Okay. Oh, quip regarding Trump's relationship Putin. agree, China definitely contender. saying wear masks around healthy people pre existing history? science works? Lol ""but Sweden"" 

You wait 6 months, I'm going things sit lazy ass. Assuming 30's, Tim almost certainly fine.  want clear, stupid Hicks living here. majority including spineless governor mandating anything help stop spread.  Maybe rush fill pews lost money defending rapists. PPP loan running low? used microdoses pus infected peoples oozing smallpox sores back then. didnt give cowpox microdosing vaccine. 1900s pretty funny hear things say us liberals home complaining bad everything is.

I'm curious single liberals here. 36 first cousins, three conservative mostly work poor conditions, without much hope better, due lack education poor credit. complain time, too.

Meanwhile, without exception, best paid people anywhere rather large family moderates left.  thing ... point enemies call pedo, etc., much harder persuade people enemy literal monkey. let graze routine. know get refills bedtime Soooo, like Zombie thing happening then? Same. There’s couple restaurants locally nice outdoor seating I’ll visit isnt crowded. - cooking home takeout You’re God’s work, sir. Good thing people dying large numbers then. Whew. try use 100% Outside air southeast, building full black mold within 6 months. Humans fundamentally same. make huge mistake classify humans century ago somehow primitive. may knowledge basic physiology psychology haven’t changed much. still respond pretty much dumb primate ways.

A year ago would’ve thought wearing mask global airborne pandemic ludicrous people century ago certainly outliers. are.

I notice lot topics though think comes relatively black white history get school. “Senator Jones said X 1812 meant X” presented without context. Yet 2020 senator stands says something know certain audience motive don’t go process Ol’ Jones 1812. I’ve creditors months. Two roommates two different places lost income due pandemic. One roommates recovered alcoholic went rehab. move twice, savings ended gone. I’ve moved car leaking power steering fluid mass transit cut fix car - there’s means get around. 

I’ve found credit card companies aren’t nice they’ve made news. One creditors, Petal Card - literally pretending pandemic gearing sue people. 

Next month I’m probably going work glasses instead contacts. prescription date, ran money month thanks car. okay. grandmother used cry say wanted die. 
That point. proved point. 

Not EVERY family devastated covid death. work matter according ChiComs, protects virus another story know popular gripe, it’s reasonable expect recommendations public would virus handful isolated cases versus endemic virus. works, ”in theory”.  America would never sell North Dakota Canada. mean, Canada already Alberta. want Canada even oil powerhouse compared US? Smallpox eradicated 1980. still giving vaccines US 1972. remember well still scar arm. understand rationale behind massive fine seems bit authoritarian me. can't stop young people acting like young people indefinitely. What? Teachers aren’t willingly putting lives unnecessary risk politicians want to? shocked! eaten restaurant since late February... I've eaten outside couple times coffee outside cafe couple times. Good know. think people legitimate issues breathing (physical issues), well people like psychological issues associated feeling like can’t breathe. dad similar reaction me, interesting. tells could genetic.

The important thing doesn’t stop wearing mask. feel like need take off, even moment, distance people much possible. incompetence politicians thought typo money shortages went back browser scroll saw thread lab monkey shortages. lack planning attributed malice ever widening consequences show real reckoning deserved. afraid also shows one coming. Lol one thinks cold virus infect brain cells. bad news you. vegetative state. virus nefarious unpredictable. Ok Houston Florida still there? aren’t dead they? world didn’t end it? Probably people dont even symptoms.  yeah...

Those averages btw, they're legally mandated minimum specific exceptions. Applies everyone cleaning service workers business executives. Makes alternative seem bit masochistic unnecessary. Try angry strangers internet. uncles Facebook memes say? guy I've protesting since June, streets demanding change. yourself? never suggested bloody revolution that's extreme last resort measure, civil disobedience, national protest, strikes etc. get us need ways historically Americans demanded change successfully obtained it. entire stance demand deserve rest laurels allow small comforts satisfy quench reaching true potential nation.  I’m sure deception going on, govt individuals lot lose admit got sick. even so, number ill people fatalities low. things hard hide. hospital records dead bodies would (dead?) giveaway. Hungary seems bad. many downplayer, denier.. Yes, correct. Peeps Easter might well cancel whole thing. I'll repeat read said:

Nobody believes c19 myth hoax. media baloney.

Many people believe c19 dangerous advertised also believe lockdowns political medical. FHM never said “children don’t spread virus”. said “children drivers pandemic”. 

Th ECDC [this cases identified school settings suggest child child transmission schools uncommon primary cause SARS-CoV-2 infection children whose onset infection coincides period attending school, particularly preschools primary appropriate physical distancing hygiene measures applied, schools unlikely effective propagating environments occupational leisure settings similar densities conflicting published evidence impact school closure/re-opening community transmission levels, although evidence contact tracing schools, observational data number EU countries suggest re-opening schools associated significant increases community transmission. sorry rather flip joke expense. hope pull through. [this article 2016 varies state state. Believe what? unproven hypothesis presented fact reddit post? 

This claim unproven - it’s literally idea. Anyone brain *shouldn’t* “believe” anymore believe claim wearing mask causes infertility. global communication aka internet... Mine? No. Yeah change rules lot.

My girlfriend works kindergarten, changed rules many times. mostly rely kids outside time. Gas still WAY people actually going out. Attendance WAY places like Disney be. Trust me, LOTS people still refusing participate economy. ones care vocal it, trying badger everyone else want.

My solution simply refuse participate economy. first, tried buy gift cards local restaurants, curbside pickup stuff local stores, etc. people started protesting guns front capital buildings open hair salons, college football coaches started demanding allow games despite guidance professionals...I'm done. refuse participate economy absolutely required, continue economically protest either vaccine well-proven, people grow up. still understand what’s going on? already going Wisconsin. Passing now. Relevant points:       
* ""An effective vaccine presents safest way reach herd immunity.""      
* "" stage, non-pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing, patient isolation, face masks hand hygiene, proven effective controlling circulation virus therefore strictly enforced. ""

Conclusion: like Sweden. i'm taking like 3 people think. refering added U.S. gets ""knock-out vaccine that's 85 [to] 90% effective,"" ""just everybody gets vaccinated,"" society ""a degree immunity"" allows general public ""walk theater without masks feel like comfortable"" risk catching COVID-19.

He’s talking going without masks distancing get article. Retroviruses RNA retrovirus type virus inserts copy RNA genome[a] DNA host cell invades, thus changing genome cell

that's wiki, comment nonsensical

Only RNA viruses retroviruses.

Coronavirus retrovirus, agree act one. mere fact people things evidence good ideas. 

Just pandemic mean pandemic us. Loss job protests yes, anti-mask protest seems senseless. probably smallest price one pay pandemic, one long periods time.

I know feeling. want go visit parents time up. made sure grandparents, wife needs help mother (going 90 psychotic).

I would quarantined two weeks Canada, two weeks get back.

My wife promised we're going world tour said done. real enemy gross back ass 🤢 cankles  Good maybe people finally see serious pandemic taken. Good neighbors right thing Interesting bring up. Basically, masking makes difference. BLM protests *very* highly masked (look videos photos online see, usually 90+% masked), epidemiologists found significant spikes around times locations protests. believe me, public reports googled anyone wants look up. 

Eating restaurant, necessary remove mask breathe virus-infected exhaled breath surrounding air *does* lead infection spikes. also studied demonstrated fact. Again, believe me, look yourself. shit mean theaters open. 79 like Fauci could see year. not...it’ll lot sooner 

People already going school, football games, parties think safer are, deadliest co-morbidity. general rule easily spread, less deadly is. don’t understand; don’t answer question?
And downvoting me?
Are you’re teacher yourself, perhaps? predictions manifest.

Where hell last 6 months? work healthcare-type field I'm honestly shocked many co-workers anti mask trolls come out: dependent several factors acknowledges. optimistic projection mid 2021. saying definitely need shut completely year. saying need built herd immunity returning normal avoid severe consequences.

You plan lessons, create content online, share students. host live classroom sessions something like Zoom give lesson/answer questions, there's plenty websites available use streamline class easy way.

Most us also recording posting live sessions online, student can't make class reason, make lesson class work following link.

In addition, schools providing computers kids. They're given tools need guidance make work, they're giving kids extra time make anything they're missing. Online school perfect solution, completely doable waaaaaay responsible shoving hundreds kids adults small rooms pandemic half even believe real understand BASIC. FUCKING. INSTRUCTIONS.

This protest-or-perish black-and-white/either-or thinking utter nonsense. little effect nationwide trend, still going down.   must reading different sources death rates.

That depends, increase infectivity help spread make deadly. people moving back parents. upper middle-class WFH crowd care, they'll call lockdowns protect precious health, disregarding everyone else. nothing though. 17 people dying per day, average age 80+, good enough reason another lockdown country go bankrupt. Paris become Beirut try that, people die misery saved covid.  blockbusters good news. Give old film noir pictures day, I'm well stocked... watch many half dozen times. No, lie. gave best information time gave it. understanding virus time limited. made mistake. lie, came understand initial advice wrong, corrected himself.

Fauci provided reliable, truthful advice anyone involved US response virus.  That’s license say anything then. don’t know doesn’t cause unknown illness turns people lizards 6.6 years infection.

You can’t claim science go stuff based reality. Sorry, but.. bad :/ everyone needs get lives, we’re spending years inside house. could Jim Carrey wearing Mask experience direct observation systems children. normal school preferable ? offers better outcome especially risk. calculation made offer inferior education children teachers don’t want take risk. 
If kids learning well would still receive full paycheck? so, know job? hopefully standardized tests see.  Absolutely normal here. God forbid mentioned decided live instead spending next year two locked basement stash three tonnes flour... Good luck enforcing that. Golfing outdoors socially distanced activity, dad would perfectly safe too. mom could safely knit listen music next RV, zero contact humans required. 

Infection rates low, someone old still avoid spending time indoors others Canada. there's much outdoors winter besides skiing ice skating. tree fitty. get fined another $10,000 person gets sick bringing home virus anyway kids. didn't.

Its word vague meaning context.

I see hump number cases, thats wave. think want crucify it. making mountain molehill.

Tell ya what, this? Admit take time read wrote wrote went straight angry typing. might get somewhere. like flood create interdimensional portals spread unless wipe galaxy via halo arrays? actually like 0.5% estimates. viruses tend mutate become deadly form good evolutionary reasons (it want kill host).

Ah, I'm NY. thank you!  Donald loves dancers when? March? true many European countries seen sharp increase cases since July. seen death toll increase now. won’t available widely least 3-6 months approval people won’t even access quite time. Im curious vaccines moment. I’m going talk vaccine Oxford trialing. proven ineffective corona comes back badly uk happen? vaccine go back square one? looks old run down, generally unhealthy.  was. serious note, agree 100%. youre wrong sub discussing one point view. please leave Well yeah, assume understand asking for. point reply caps xl? true username? Yep numbers go down, people become careless, things open up, numbers go up. cycle. takes long come down. starting things, carelessly. getting flu shots numbers low. Things like numbers go up. You’re missing part serious mitigation efforts place currently fight Covid. Prior pandemic, one wore masks social distanced, shut businesses flu virus. Therefore, way people exposed flu. However, flu less deadlier, also vaccines therapeutics help combat it. 

Covid still far contagious could infect far people, everything (well us) mitigate contagious virus. Also look new cases/deaths graph start pandemic compare graphs tell significant lag deaths back then.... example was
—-

2000 new cases uk 26th March. 4675 died 9th April
2000 new cases uk 29th August. 6 died 11th September.  Damn, FEMA barely manage one hurricane disaster zone time. seems nice. /s  baffles many people lack empathy basic understanding illness families, even whole communities even question existence. sad American right now. I'm proud. Im sad. Youd think could announce without identifiers. course, subject could come forth well.  I’ve learned it’s best troll people. 

You get point across minimal energy devoted them. [Wow, wonder Yeah countries would typically expect well time like due factors. one thing. Stable government, competent government, less fractured response, trust government, education, geographic location country, wealth, etc. 

We're travel hub really whole responded way encourage spread, fractured response, corruption, misinformation, uneducated country particularly anti-authority anti-science, everyone involved tribal politics... 

It's point USA clearly outlier even trying cover mess. People beginning find hard believe intentional extent, even point fingers particular direction. refuse go bars. Grocery store? Sure. Golf? Great. beach? See there

But takes certain type “IDGAF” go bar hopping middle pandemic, every patron bar it... I’ll keep distance US Federal Got pandemic response plan current president tossed well team members. previous admin would plan well would treated NATIONAL EMERGENCY pandemic get effective -15 Fahrenheit could create drive thru vaccination centers industrial freezer locations. ""By"" implies gradual fade. Can't say universally. always surprises saddens many people suffer lack money wealthy country. already that, called Sun. Chinese government graciously allows shine upon China, upon whole World... now. need know know... break confidentiality rules? Yesssss!! boss died COVID first thing everyone asks old health. It’s maddening. travel family, need quarantine 14 days believe. there’s another case TM vaccine arm, vials getting thrown trash immediately.

I doubt it, billions dollars already sunk Oxford vaccine. Sure, maybe 1 percent got TM maybe would undeniably dangerous distribute, 0.05, 0.01, even 0.001 percent? draw line depends things, like many people die coronavirus go unvaccinated much share price drop stockholders take?

This science supposed transparent also AstraZeneca share findings safety committee. I'm hopelessly optimistic. idea, that's user enlighten us. good times, anyone got time machine. redeeming qualities basically every part United States. person living North Dakota paying $600 month rent would probably ask someone they're living california paying $2000 month rent. one two weeks people huh? That's exactly saying much, unless addiction gain weight, people mid 20s going look much different mid 30s Worse :( chance. absolutely right exactly would needed vaccines 100% accurate, also end people handle. Vaccines out, going license live/kill will. least 342 people affiliated Michigan State University tested positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since August 24.
   
That's concerning small area. looking excess deaths covid positives deaths. Every day Fauci remind us we're fucked. God bless him. love him. 
No helpful hints, time wasted studies stats, updates hospital capacity bullshit.
Just straight point. Coronavirus nothing could it. Since lots people ofcourse surprises nobody understands lock protocols arbitrary hail mary method logically sound choice faced UNKNOWN pandemic UNKNOWN severity.

People uncomfortable acting unknown variables ambivalence stakes high, even correct course. need certainty, they'll grab whatever provides it, matter dumb is. Honestly screw Senate best reply ""can show evidence support hypothesis"".

Their answer course ""what evidence hypothesis mean. think needs come 3,000.00 numbers certainly bad pandemic too. least half population living paycheck-to-paycheck. people getting laid off, taking pay cuts, unable find work, etc., situation deteriorated point they're verge losing house, unable afford food, etc. I'm farmer. Living family farm that's family since 1913. People strange though. hardcore Republicans want take stuff away people generally hate everyone, they'd first help anyone community. someone sick, financial troubles, hard time community comes together like nothing find anywhere else. 

They want everyone see free stuff. someone community sick can't afford medical bills, hold pie auction people buy pies hundreds dollars gets donated family. community father dying cancer. get though. They'll throw fit universal healthcare anything similar that, complain current system broken, show donate tons time money someone need, want change. awesome community we're straight ruining petty views, hate, jazz. take care other. What’s job Michigan State University clarify may ""MSU"" next easter ""mid/end 2021?"" shouldn’t peeked yet, idea efficacy yet. fact, they’re adding additional controls, there’s risk could make analysis less strong: Giving drug additional immune compromised individuals (like HIV-positive individuals) essentially highest risk take vaccine trial less likely convert, they’ll likely receive vaccine still get sick even vaccine highly effective. Agreed. angst wearing masks nothing compared going face vaccines roll out. Right people generally agree wearing masks social distancing right thing; want it.

Once vaccines come America going collectively say fuck start living lives. alternative potentially lifetime living like going stand for. Looks like upstanding citizen Yes. eugenic policy? asking clarification. said exactly this. girl wants daughter go back school. Kid's 11 terrified would get bring home great grandparents/grandparents/great uncle (whom lives with) want reassuring... let's get real, many kids indoor setting, probably gonna happen. option online schooling high risk household, guess decided risks outweighed benefits... get it.

If bring virus home, want know *not fault*.  worse: like Martin Gina keep feeling like true bay area surge coming. guess things eventually open up, fall bad time Social distancing normal. Michigan fine now... co-morbidity took oath help fucktards listen advice scientific leaders wear mask stay away fucktards break infection cycle. people listened took 2 weeks stay home, watch tv don’t go breath place, we’d mess. Thank goodness smallpox mostly eradicated. (Sorry rant -cars carrying scientist experience virology) might misunderstanding situation. inmates already already virus immune, infect visitors them, people ""once leave penitentiary""? country block. x-axis labeled January thru August bottom.

Worst case scenario mid/end 2021. Kamala said trust vaccines came Trump still office. #EUGENIC POLICY place like los angeles avoided NY style numbers locking down. Surging months fact, treatments better allowed better fatality rate worried enough heat food 1 hr . would cooking home. Uh yeah there's virus. contagious.

Lol. knew. hard breathe head far ass? That’s revert back to, *”it’s X% cases, scared small thing?”* people still need abide mask, distancing local lockdown rules.

I’m shocked surprised. result truly came nowhere. could imagined would happen. It’s even right it’s denying liberals win 

Some hippie says “Don’t eat yellow snow “ eating yellow snow Despite mastery English language, response nothing dialog conversation. fact even make clear position is.

Are letting virus run course, taking whatever lives taking whatever steps necessary save every life possible?

Those two extreme positions perhaps best exemplified Sweden New Zealand. course neither approach perfect every country. Population density, medical resources, general fitness level, financial solvency ability close borders different everywhere nation must adapt response.

But effective must consensus course action come somewhere between. pass France car month ago. 

When stopped eat rest non-French people wearing masks, crowded. seem care all. infertility image multiple vaccines work, confident get vaccines 7 billion people world. one. Dr. Fauci also ridiculed idea wearing masks pandemic TV. Obviously changed position.  Definition global map = USA? Wow Jeez, could seen coming? /s Dude even close halfway realistically put life hiatus? It’s like whole country stay home 2 weeks. Utilities need people working keep things running. healthcare sector needs staff keep coming work. Food suppliers sellers can’t close. Police, fire fighters, postal workers, public works, pharmacists, etc. need keep working. 

I understand idea you’re saying even Dr. Fauci asked scenario said it’s theoretically possible realistically feasible. People can’t stay home, life continue. problems?

Don't use essential oils solve Normal normal does, paraphrase Gump. Normal routine. It’s default. Wearing masks normal. Putting packages decon zone couple days normal. “inside” “outside” clothes decontaminate trips outside normal. things used normal, they’re normal. Muahahahahahahahahaha. stay 6 foot away other. virus can't survive past 6 feet. agree. Personally, higher-risk situations like grocery shopping, wear surgical mask topped 2-layer cloth mask. find comfortable cloth mask itself. children write shit reddit gonna horrible parents. source? absolutely correct. 

 anecdotal best expressed opinion inherent fact. never claimed answers otherwise. 

That said experience, logged proffesionals variety different types count data. I'm one 6.5 million cases United States luck experts able look cases next year two determine facts are. ask live high risk? curious got in, likelihood getting in, etc. Well really shame Democratic governors Midwest states keep beautiful people safe.

Right, North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri Iowa. Mentioned article.

North Dakota; Doug Burgum (R)

South Dakota; Kristi Noem (R)

Missouri; Mike Parson (R)

Iowa; Kim Reynolds (R)

You reality problems today? Except knew months ago. High threshold cycle positives absolutely It’s amazing different people enjoy different things. Absolutely shocking. headline camera pans opening credits zombie movie Some, sure.

But enough still social distancing enough keep cases going down. can’t reason conclusions weren’t reached reason (X) Doubt

I'm way, way, inclined believe companies used panic buying toilet paper example boost sales jack prices.

1. Claim shortage
2. Masses panic buy
3. Increase prices
4. Profit. ....no. claimed body aches, cough, fatigue year would suck response comment saying concerned effects year. didnt claim going happen relation covid. People believe ""temperature goes up"" stupid understand anything beyond start calling climate change. person responded mocking idiocy can't even see lmao Good thing 7 day average hospitalizations deaths significantly since July peak continues go lower. pedantic, asymptomatic infections likely contagious. Presymptomatic certainly are.

Nearly everyone outside epidemiologists get two confused. Asymptomatic means never show symptoms know infected. Presymptomatic means symptoms right develop later, contagious entire time, even symptoms appear. really aren’t great 😂 Perhaps some. read multiple articles stating wearing mask could actually worse traps virus unless wearing medical grade one fitted properly. 

Then changed minds wore one mandatory. I'm still nervous doctors work orginally advised it. feel like science experiment. vaccinated, individual choose within restrictions likely need take precautions vaccine takes hold; assuming job. prerogative; shame want.

You also said getting back normal pipe dream, I've already pointed nonsensical alarmist take. take issue with. course things immediately turn normal comes societal rules regulations. magical thinking, reality. absolutely delusional think restrictions last another year. state governments (even strictest initial lockdowns) already lessening restrictions is, even vaccine distributed. mods around?

It’s concerning comments 1k upvotes deleted Yeah, shit. massive surprise closing everything, locking people home, massively altering behaviour would consequences. 

Now know virus particularly deadly demographics, realise total lockdowns massive mistake. consequences years:

Financial hardships tens millions people. That's going damage generation. Elderly people also greater poverty now.

Children missing education. idea effects lockdown mental health long-term. 

All routine surgeries, screenings treatments cancelled. We're going surge otherwise-preventable cancers future. Plus cancelled hip/knee replacements mean people chronic pain long-term disabilities.

Plus, god knows mental health 100,000's small business owners dreams totally crushed. Poverty stress hugely related bad health outcomes.

So source referencing? Please link read analyze it. **You suggesting trivial.** tantrum stems fact even dare mention issue. Like exaggerating issue possibly exist.

You pointed ""they"" produced right now. ""they"" represent less 10% vaccines development. sure insight vaccines development know fact 10% going sticking fingers ears going 'can't produced can't hear nananana'. 

I never said can't produced. **I specifically said several times belive that**, would really like stop telling lies straight face. please me? lying part nature cant tell difference anymore? Places like US Africa pressured media/ads believe formula healthier breast milk people think that’s norm. lot look up. makes people come ER runny nose “fever” 99.2F asking COVID test. appear idea covid real mock every possibly capacity trying appears ""scare"" tactics lmao. Man many people country going compatible order restored, really sad absolutely never seemed catch ""masks help"", started following virus Wuhan outbreak.

Masks always beneficial, considered necessary PPE, US shipped much N95 stockpile places needed.

There lack surety surgical/cloth masks sufficient reduce transmission rates, average citizens buying medical-grade PPE statistically low chance encountering virus start lockdown, compared medical workers, considered priority.

Eventually, late March/early April, confirmed studies efficacy face masks, cloth masks deemed acceptable coverage mouth nose everyday encounters reduce spread.

I'm sure news diet differs mine, sources ever heard downplaying masks fashion often-ignorant political sources generally taken hefty skepticism medical sources asking donations available supply dealt PPE shortages.

This confused 'we know effective are, trusting seems ill-advised without study', absolutely conflated 'mask bad'. mask usage ended like exhalation-vent mask efficacy, recommended studies came in, people would complaining drove false confidence helped spread disease.

Science takes time. People jumping gun make recommendations know whether work, or, worse, somehow making knowingly misleading statements, shows primarily issue people individual choosing trust news media, considered something reevaluate revise moving forward, rather group people blame outcome.

NFL Season Kickoff Thursday 12% 2019. That’s pretty huge. COVID definitely changed things country, world. Even people home, view game live TV without breaking social distancing, tuning in.

But it’s NFL. Sports viewership dramatically across board.

MLB 18% 2019 levels. NBA ratings 10-14% 2019 levels. don’t think authorities say so. it’s smart. People make sort disparaging comments Asians, blindly following leaders etc. hk live, gov told us wear masks yet did. it’s smart thing do. Ironically place world it’s simultaneously law wear mask yet law actually wear mask (due protests). definitely think gov may ask. brain you’ll wear one. title say, “A ten-year-old boy UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS Guam’s latest death due COVID-19…”?

Per article, “The patient 10-year-old boy underlying health conditions. tested positive COVID-19 Sept. 3..”

Seems little misleading me.

Nonetheless, doesn’t detract fact absolutely horrible, heart goes family. foregoing working sitting around inside much harm health going outside exercise.

It's clear common redditor can't trusted spin quotes headlines. fact remains disinformation. Ditto vet. heard vets curbside care, vet. whole office isn’t wearing masks notice someone come wearing one. after. don’t get it. They’re medical professionals! I’m left wondering, virus enters host-person, subsequent infection occurs, would suspect virus multiplies thus causing evolving infection. host brought lesser amount virus, virus would multiply, eventually cause infection par high dose virus. antibodies COVID-19. produce quickly? wondering. made huge poster rained end poster

I'm sorry one see coming? Lol mean blanket top?  think odds people raced bought mask supply? met humans? 

I get it, like lied either. let's face - relying people come together what's best everyone really, really good track record. FDA counting Moderna/pfizer approval year.

Oxford fell behind months. They're still done recruiting volunteers. Wow that’s nice save. wouldn’t able gracious. Like mind endanger life? Yeah mind. Yes, infect matter mill mildthe case, even asymptomatic. But, less severe infection,the less lowly infect others less people infect get. amount virus exposed influences digsickyou get. Oh please tell last part joke Availability cost probably 2 main reasons. disagree you. took months admit masks would helpful general population. people, thankfully, figured themselves. Im glad saying now. Texas opened month later hospitals overrun. Maybe could gobern big house, big white house came 'walk bar' joke wonder many humans injected Western experimental covid vaccines.. Awesome! know yet parents saying he's much smarter anyone left shaming like voting third party Biden. baffles obvious he'd higher approval dealt asap guess narcissism got way. Fascinating link, thanks adding post!  article posted long ago said virologists agree less viral load = lesser symptoms. even study version flu showed likely true, well study hamsters supporting point. hope upvoted me. said LIKELY going happen. also qualified second statement specific definition normality. details important, title written convey intended meaning, assure would say thing. I'm nurse. nurses reusing, essentially psych patient sitter, sitting outside room observing patient glass door making sure hurt room. us make much contact patients would nurses risk running quite quickly.

It's perfect, could, leaving broad daylight days end best way risk damaging them. mine went 3 days sunlight worn again.

Edit: dunno why, read jab potentially ineffective way disinfecting may expose others. Let say relying solely UV rays time. still mid 60's 70's outside happened. no. dashboard cookies baked. :( Thanks much responding! reading saw cases headache body aches, although quite rare. 

In case, took hesperedin ""Corona headache"" self massage youtube video Prune Harris last night, followed 9 hours sleep (with absolutely insane dreams) far morning headache coming back aches feet hands there. 

So maybe turned corner week suffering on/off headaches. Fingers crossed. Thanks help! intentionally spreading misinformation. never happened.

What happen two things early on:

1) People asked buy medical-grade masks, hospitals needed most. day public wide-spread availability medical-grade masks, still high demand.

2) know time masks, cloth masks, would affect covid-19. knew masks good filtering things size covid virus, yet know virus contained droplets important dosage was. such, recommend cloth masks, never told people wear them. BREAKING NEWS: news literally going ignore fact confirmed mutations spreading nearly deadly initially, fact death rate going down, amount recovered gone roof? Please. Lol literally making blunt statements see small world. Unemployment rose 6.2 million 02/2020 20.5 million 05/2020. way, increase 3 months higher increase 2 years Great Recession. People getting unemployment Govt, say sure money pay checks majority household. 

And people done whole lock shit. They're without masks fun money got unemployment. frankly, traffic everywhere restaurant packed doesnt mean mass unemployment recession. Right isnt problem. *truly* go back normal, going see major economic impact. that's advantage. everyone it, normalizes it. Kinda like vaccine. wonder antivaxxers tend anti mask well  people still go usual thought initial lockdown occasion needed cooperate.  tens millions asked afford what, year emergency? People going desperate. official cdc coronavirus site deaths 192000 People wearing masks anytime sick, waaaay Omg beautiful 911 dispatcher scant three months coworkers vile idiotic assholes I've ever displeasure meeting. Belgian expert virologist mark van ranst ask pharma companies. Yeah mean also don’t care keeping people alive pandemic much gonna care dog person called moron? Probably doesn’t happen. echo chambers “reality.” noted lot people still died small pox inoculation though, many fewer died normal exposures. Front desk similarly sized hotel.

Can confirm story here. problem initial death rate, problem speed contagion. fatality rate low, cases treated.

 spread numbers begin overwhelm health system, forcing pause healthcare making doctors choose gets treated. That's death rate (and 'excess deaths') begins rise. 

And course every death, multiple people survive severe enough illness cause ongoing health problems... BS. COVID top NY end april 20. summer 21 it’s gonna difficult. Damn. I'm student teaching mask free...because totally remote whole fall, matter what. People hoarding N95 mask without anyone saying wear mask.

Whay hell makes anyone think tell us wear mask. Right, like vaccine would take years develop. Okay. understanding NYC use PPE less infection average New Yorker. think issues.

While people complain CCP brainwashing citizens, see people like fellow regurgitating talking points Chinese-related issues. 

Uyghur re-education camps awful get similar things going countries barely get level attention (e.g. migrant camps USA, genocide Ronhinya Myanmar, blackout Indian part Kashmir, Palestinians Israel.

It's like everyone brings shitty things UK USA rest world whenever names get mentioned. first people tell Americans need wear masks operating international guidance lot Chinese influence. got set up. Pretty risky inside long period time. exactly want avoid, inside, people, long period time.  virus essentially trying become perfect symbiote, less cool venom though. 


What confuses is, good old virus strain vaccine going do? 

We get flu shot every year, good years virus vaccine going next year different.


Theres already meant multitude strains. Lol. won’t understand right nose whole time! escape, tell it... moved US Netherlands husband baby last year. first winter tough, alone young child lots windy, rainy, grey days. husband starting get frustrated me, (rightfully so) pushing find part-time childcare could time socialize adults.

I optimistic January - knew way around finally felt comfortable driving (terrified hitting cyclist, they’re everywhere), joined club swimming childcare, hire part-time nanny, found local activities hopefully meet people. husband even plans first night alone since baby. everything came crashing down, plans cancelled, activities stopped.

Spring summer okay beautiful outdoor space view, we’re walkable not-too-densely-populated city we’re able get days least see human life around us. Nevertheless, one two-year-old talk time, day mostly consists trying keep occupied quiet husband’s work calls. think I’m jealous gets talk people, even via work, also still go bike rides friends.

I know I’m luckier don’t work husband’s job safe, still tough it’s definitely taken toll. escape, release, nothing interesting say husband more, time daughter’s finally asleep want left alone. don’t see killing marriage, there’s definitely tension right now. know we’re right thing staying safe, know it’s temporary keep pushing ahead. Still, it’s little scary. Yep Great, masks going give children autism. lived 10 days covid-19 positive person always wore mask pressence never got sick. people wore masks careful would ok. I'm sure ever going stop wearing mask. love it. Lol. Okay wear mask get vaccines. problems? Yeah, comment pure commonsense trust Americans put others families. That's just... enculturated. Telling wear mask, based comment history commenters pointed out? Good, wear mask, people continue telling so. point, need call risk reasonably low. reason say 6 ft. distance people. magical barrier virus 6 ft, risk acceptably small range.

Having people quarantine 2 weeks offer enough benefit cost people's time, money mental health. it’s extremely frustrating. especially people really can’t wear masks protection. son severe asthma. mostly staying home occasionally needs go appointments run errand me. went appointment started get asthma mask started panic made worse go outside away people could get air use puffer. another time go target get shoes things quickly. Within 10 minutes wearing mask target started get bad asthma attack. left got puffer think end trying go anywhere time unless absolutely necessary. see people wearing masks wearing properly knows may severe asthma too. know still tries wear mask, painful scary flares asthma, still best can, people actually wear masks without issue aren’t putting seriously can’t wear masks risk. Like Obama's restocking whole H1N1 / Ebola/ Zika issue anything it. Get real! sadly. No, way hell going long. army watching streets short while, people would understand. countries.  many times people need see fucking thing keep happening. ""And course yor dishonesty ignore number cases 4 times america.""

Do understand per capita is? I've said like 10 times now, aka ""deaths per millions"". course US going absolute cases, population much larger European countries. 

""You still claiming competent leader would make zero difference president lying makes difference all. compare china, between""

This laughable strawman argument. saying Chinese style authoritarian lockdown works great stopping virus, would worked society due legal, cultural, societal, political issues. Trump move New York California army impose quarantine martial law welds sick people inside homes similar Chinese. Perhaps genius leader amazing could come wonderful plan would worked US, delusional think clinton anyone else person right now. Seriously point brilliant leader i'll vote them. 

""No one trying convince moment ignorant convince . believe experiences competent person would made difference trump. par anti vacciners saving you. like saying doctor makes difference quack. one tries convince anti vacciners, laugh them""

Blah blah blah rhetoric strawmen. Seriously trying convince for? nothing ineffective last paragraph. ad hominem verbal diarrhea .  every government least mandate cloth masks even give low income folks cut number illnesses deaths. studies showed well made multi layer cloth masks good exam room masks. I've said, say wear mask outright lied. incredibly misinformed. Sorry could handled mask thing better. Even province old info page ""don't wear masks help"" bullshit it. think that's ok. ""Boss makes dollar, 
I make dime, 
That's shit 
On company time."" I'm leaving OB reason. OB literally saved son's life thought I'd retires, last time office half put mask on, crowded waiting room, tried convince need vaccine Covid19 flu I'm healthy infected.

That's realized education make people smarter MDs retarded. Yes, ""coronavirus"" useful predicting long immunity last, I've read. factors like specific structure virus, much mutates, etc are. No. That’s potential death many. say name hotel mean yeah, claim slight mutation original sars flat wrong. I'm one wears mask work well. 

In hospitality industry nonetheless.

Maybe third customers masked. ok first British, Peeps past, really like them, yeah kind shock. however glad read right thing employees however, meantime happens kids back schools???? Guinea pigs? shortage still ended Fascistic types want weakest killed. kind thing. Next up, vaccines cause autism. break. 

There bodies piling streets, people fighting provisions supplies. 


We need serious help quick, 8 months deadly virus ravished us. doomed!



Repent sins alll die! article longest non-answer I’ve read while. save humanity.~~

[to keep tiny bit depressing also kind fun like wearing sunglasses. mind wear much makeup. alone worth it!  lining either. long, everyone's view plenty time evolve constantly stay close enough sync. Add kids family around lot balance. 

What really seems crazy however roommates especially like random, split rent ones. Relationship built functional need got establish keep evaluating huge level trust. Yikes.

That said, people trust really helpful working something significant handle also time like this. I've ways course covid know I'd coping much outside voices help think things months in. demonstrated early phase outbreak condition dose dependant.

If get substantial dose virus, body know hit get overwhelmed.

You want give body time identify invader take action forcing virus position build numbers pretty key. feel like thing happening Japan. Everybody wore masks first reports started coming Wuhan continue today. Also alcohol available EVERYWHERE continually sanitising hands shopping trolleys/baskets etc. cases seems serious death toll low. keep waiting worst come doesn’t. We’ve cases surrounding jobs massive spread. I’m convinced masks cleanliness answer. Everybody know (myself included) comes home removes clothes immediately, washes straight away shower. shoes inside, people know even wipe reusable shopping bags everything buy supermarket. I’m sure getting exposure virus nobody know really sick. husband unwell 3-4 days (coinciding summer holidays luckily stayed home), fever, body aches cough soon bounced back. query weren’t tested. tested 10 days later teacher wanted careful returning break, test negative. reddit downvoting hell back march ""stealing n95"" frontline workers. Apparently frontline workers wanted 2 year old 3M masks used house cleaning lol

I got downvoted saying wore mask gloves even deleted comments. Fortunately listen internet everything.

I even tried post study disinfecting reusing masks. get whole pandemic exposing people small doses virus? Yep seems people saying “well shouldn’t broken law” (in cases killed police violence) people openly proudly breaking law terms Covid regulations. Regulations put place keep grannies dying. It’s really impressive amount mental gymnastics. proves true, this. actual natural selection happening right eyes. right, has. friend right normal regular friendship with, shared happy things sad things confided reach like normal friends. 

When Pandemic hit, shut wanted talk happy, positive, good things. talk Covid, politics, personal struggles job loss. realized acknowledging lost business, really hurt. simply respond much talked subjects mattered me, stopped sharing since obviously setting hard boundary. wanted send pictures animals talk great things are. relationship really changed needed friend most. 

Even family talk job loss awkward them. I'm one hurting everyone kept trying stay positive downplay situation, saying people back work soon. felt really alone lockdown, people around living reality was. 

The way people coping change mostly denial, many stay denial entire time over. feels alone.  Dr. Fauci didn’t recommend them. specifically told people wearing masks wasn’t necessary one point. Masks give Sharia Law  Dr. Fauci didn’t know. specifically told people wearing masks wasn’t necessary one point. Really dangerous thing do. already sold everywhere point. grew two uncles chiropractors (and two cousins who've since become chiropractors), got somewhat regular adjustments always assumed chiropractic normal, broadly accepted medical field. Took mid-20s realize case.

The last time visited local chiro, back pain, wanted immediately proceed full set X-rays, started talking health insurance deductible like gonna easily breeze right thousands dollars despite fact making $11/hr job time. Then, told nicely fucking way happening, tried send home (shockingly expensive) magnetic bracelets homeopathic shit. uncomfortably left, realized huge, beautiful office two pretty young adminstrative employees sitting front, browsing Facebook brand new iMacs ""customer"" there. suffered couple days, back recovered accord.

I've plenty friends go chiro weekly (or even twice-weekly) basis chiro sells idea needs regular, ongoing thing. people injuries, regular people suffer mild back pain occasionally. I've felt like barfing everytime bogus study brought day published. Absolutely. worried family live with, try keep distance home can. live father risk keep distance him. kind sucks I'm make sure potentially pass him. Yeah using n95 get through. reuse one week straight, elastic could stratched mask timy bits got in. That's none pandemic times use once. Matrix right. 1999 pinnacle civilization. Florida battling coronavirus. I’m RN covid unit second largest city Florida. unit 1 positive patient. hard right would love comparison Washington revolutionary war exposure therapy.  CanSino's Ad5-nCoV recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine, Oxford's Chadox-s well Russia's Sputnik-V.

Get facts right first. included italy us deaths today edited previous post make clear. course dishonesty ignore number cases 4 times america. studies showing life long effects even asymptomatic patients. 

Once disease doctors hospitals control death rates. country us pathetic hospitals less number beds first affected ICU equipments etc place. Breathing machines produced mass manufactured italy already lot deaths. goverment still able control spread disease limit deaths 

The government help preventing people getting first place. government failed America high %, 4 times italy, despite way time prepare. means **if infection rate Italy, america would seen 46.5k deaths today instead 195k deaths**

You still claiming competent leader would make zero difference president lying makes difference all. compare china, 

No one trying convince point ignorant convince . believe experienced competent person would made difference trump. par anti vacciners saving you. like saying doctor makes difference quack. one tries convince anti vacciners, laugh people dont want permanent complications get even asymptomatic cases even healthy probably order best protection possible, every one else needs wearing masks too. Masks alone 1 person little. real vaccine friends lost along way. forgot indicate sarcasm. That's nice, honestly idea talking about... mean that's type virus works, use ppe, yes spooky oil companies related all... go store, get tattoo... safer getting tattoo. want magic free money forever? That's money works. Seven months business like still shutdown incompetence based actual risk. children died this? saying fine risk children dying play others? Exac!!! false. There's plenty psychology evidence decades ago true. idea CDC stupid. right. seems, given stats quoting headline could easily written

*You likely catch COVID friends family going restaurant.*

(That greater percentage people contact infected family member friend reported going restaurant. think support statement given data article. raw numbers.) Family sporting masks since late February. I've seen well work first hand countries. slapped bad boys soon seemed like shit gonna go down. reduced viral load explained start, clearly, people offered free masks forced wear them.

Forcing people wear calling people anti maskers stupid social media obsessed everyone same. Interesting. I'm teacher opened Wednesday. Everyone wore masks Wednesday. Everyone. Friday, almost one was. People wear around chins, ears, etc. Frustrating. Ty :) fewer Yeah, people seem misappropriated scientific term (vaccine induced herd immunity thing!) policy formerly known ""IDGAF"". are! really funny seeing looks getting comeback, grew time. like taking glimps past. Absolutely. said ""Masks help Healthcare workers, essential workers first responders need most. short. catch y'all stay home we'll pay you. soon production everything reopen. high risk segment population continue pay stay home learn effective treatments and/or get vaccine."" know simplifying people shot, spit beaten masks. handled honesty day one.

Edit add much pain suffering death could possibly avoided proper mask use.

Thank awards. first really appreciate it. countries well strict lockdowns gradual reopening ramped testing, strict mask policy lot contact tracing. South Korea didn’t lockdown Bc jumped massive testing quarantining positives right gate. let spread like wildfire can’t get demon back it’s cage. actually trying is. Germany said things right way early on, would cost economy long run. Every country seemed understand this. remember saying lockdowns started basically limit long could go we'd need figure things. unfortunately many places, lock long enough re-opened way quick experienced lots problems based that. lockdowns really feasible long term solution. made sense time order get societal acceptance many steps would make safe re-open, gain knowledge time fight it, unemployment going huge pandemic also needs fought. is. theory largely extroverts susceptible mental health issues COVID. Continue doing. listen 148 idiots problem 2 wearing masks.  Interesting. I'll dig around coin jar see one. can't recall ever seen one. Deaths lag weeks behind cases. People get sick die next day. 

We saw happen US summer.

First cases rise, hospitalizations, deaths. Hospitalizations already rising France. Next spike deaths. 

Its fear mongering, second wave. Pandemics usually multiple waves. good chance IMO hard hit areas mild spikes, time tell fall upon us. changed “one of” deadliest pathogens. Thanks comment. 

Of course AIDS kills fewer people per year US coronavirus done 7 months , don’t know worldwide numbers. HIV treatments too.

Ebola killed far fewer people worldwide none people contracted Ebola US died much higher mortality rate. I’m good adding coronavirus top killer pathogens 100 years, it’s pointless heartbreaking weigh deaths other. Thanks clarifying comment seen hyperbolic. think might happening? I'd like add interesting tidbit. know many heard ""inflated"" covid death numbers. also covid deaths reported covid deaths. city live 2 confirmed covid-19 deaths. Somebody 76, another 80's. someone workplace get covid spread 5 people. 5 got A-symptomatic never experienced symptoms. guy spread everyone bad cough, breathing issues, fatigued. 2 days ""recovered"".. died.. nobody knew least 2 weeks loner. reporting work answering calls. Finally somebody went house concerned found dead. underlying health conditions? Yes did. type 2 diabetic 44 years old. Due decomposition want autopsy. never ruled covid death. put trivial comfort politics client. professional. Another thing cases happened within month reopening English isn’t Russian troll’s first language. Propaganda is. worst health orgs like CDC initially saying masks might harm good might make touch face give false sense security. kids gotten 8 grade tell anyone important masks are. took dog vet curbside drop wore masks.. never left car.. Lol Dont worry number change schools opening getting 6am EST, wake 8am, clock in, go back sleep 9 - 10 am, somewhere there. work done two hours, spend rest day exercising, playing video games, watching tv hanging cat. stress levels basically zero deal drive work. I'm spending time working me, I've heard owners place business may stick working home permanently. think saw much money they're saving lol. Okay I'm officially tired person hotspot engaging least one high-risk behavior necessary (like going work doctor).

Every single person know. Every single one. I'm really tired now. Even guy complains people wearing masks work still goes sports games properly distanced. 

Seriously, can't give things little bit? almost like test failing. I've given everything except employment, go wear faceshield plus mask plus rearranged entire work schedule avoid crowded areas.

I nothing work come home. get deliveries, go quarantine 72 hours. get grocery pickup, gets wiped quarantined. eaten out, gone out, jogged (even relatively safe), parties, family visits, nothing. that's be, can't give save someone vulnerable, fucking fail life. Put game piece away stop fucking others. Stupid shit time supporting for-profit healthcare abolishment ACA prevented insurance companies denying Americans health insurance due pre-existing conditions. 

The irony sweet. try place blame someone getting sick Covid whether pre-existing conditions, simultaneously arguing pre-existing conditions bar someone receiving healthcare.

These people don’t give two shits anyone themselves, even go way spread pain around people deem unworthy. next time one people ask “pre-existing conditions”, tell fuck off. spread fake news?? Mine too. can't even go ask question. link NEOJopinion piece? appropriate? certainly less catchy, conveys less concern black people  So, officially then.  one acclimating - they’re struggling persistently dwindling resources. nation, much world, treading water - due human unwillingness cooperate. Depends testing really misses friends social takes me. blames me, least partially. rough.

It's rough. conversation girlfriend despicable virus yet says ""feels controlled"" me. 

I'm thankful tells knows I'm controlling - pushes responsibility safety admittedly saying ""no"" look like bad guy friends travelling wanting hang midst fucking pandemic.

I think lot people expected 2 months tops realize would take us mid 2021 fatigued. What? saying makes sense ""mask person""? Wtf

She can't wear one around least considerate feelings? Read hotel room....

Fuck Thanks good read! want men wear masks? Find correlation Covid penis shrinkage. Motherf***** wearing three them! Interesting, happen think there’s strong possibility virus accidentally came lab (but probably listen much Joe Rogan). result belief, I’m substantially careful that’s lot scarier unpredictable something naturally developed.. Privilege Japan! That’s what’s crazy this. daughter took proper precautions still caught COVID. I’m glad ppe protected caused minor infection goes show even best safety put place, one immune potentially catching virus. Also Facebook Fox news LAW, CANT MAKE WEAR MASK
/s  Wow way totally miss point.

And cite opinion piece Irish Times.

Great work around. lethalness low allows spread. killed everyone got it, wouldnt spread much.

Some people get symptoms. Maybe got partial immunity past illnesses. unknown. Thank you. I've looking last ten minutes NEJM find it. true! Yeah, we're seeing right waaay I've ever seen life incredibly strange. Car accidents less common WAY random, thus ""expendable"" population situation really apply here. even assuming virus kill people random, would cases, we're going weigh risks benefits.

Is continuing lockdown going benefit us cause financial/social/mental health risks outweigh them? way really figure test out, essentially requires people guinea pigs, obviously lot people uncomfortable (especially parents young kids going back school.)

It's tricky situation that's going play time. hijabs worked Iran wouldn’t outbreak. mild side effects common, hoping indication whether got real thing. working everyone, boat sooner later. Yes. dumb people. do...at least US. They're pretty uncommon, they're bit bigger quarters. JFK's face them. Sounds like pretty swell timing! Congratulations baby, hope family wonderful lives. 🤙🏽 No, Covid is. Black people suffer more, lack vitamin probable cause. axe! also didn’t internet people spreading disinformation hysteria. children getting it. People would protective children. know lot anti-vaxxers think protecting children knows. case didn’t get memo, we’re still middle first wave deadly pandemic that’s killed 200,000 Americans made thousands permanently (possibly) injured. 

Having someone sit 1 foot away exposed raw skin that’s punctured needle thousands times per minute risk virus infecting doesn’t sound like much common sense. government done fucking job prevented business going under.

But GOP currently fighting protect oil companies billion dollar industries could give two shits real small businesses. Yeah starting masking sooner most. educated friends telling “masks don’t help” based early advice. think initial confusing messaging helped contribute anti-mask nonsense. Honestly...there percent population may want vaccine wants covid continue on. disgusting! Lol thats wondering  Hats you, man. shy away setting good example. you’re young you’ll recover cough mild fever. I’ve seen friends recover way. really serious. Oh there’s question -20C way reasonable places, it’s like we’re going enough *either* vaccine first. It’s perfectly reasonable allocate Pfizer vaccine major academic centers lots -70C storage distribute Moderna candidate places, use dirt-cheap (relatively speaking) -20C.

Pfizer also actively pursuing -20C stability data, might end moot point. poor guy... Spent whole life preparing moment finally comes noone listens him. Lol. Evidence: rally Nevada. relevant comment. Quite apart violating Godwin first post! heartbreaking. YES - new vet. wonder else show. Right left correct. political affiliations subject poor judgement, I’m afraid. happens conservatives much often. 2-3 year gap Gen X true Millennials... Cool. Risk likely low. might get placebo one take may work though.

But need testers! read article. Black Lives Matter different subject. appropriate title;
*Vitamin reduced rate ICU admission 50% 2%. black people need Vitamin supplementation?* Yep, life never better techie elites Reddit referring nation's Surgeon General. name ""Jerome Adams"". said idiotic things masks early on, since changed tune. However, early misinformation stuck personally responsible deaths thousands people. know live himself. is, far, worst surgeon general country ever had.

Do listen rumors half-truths coming people good jobs. Current scientific thinking points wearing masks, especially layered cotton kind like buy etsy. 

It shame Jerome Adams us. upmost respect

utmost respect mean better lying us.  Plus many antivaxxers confusing people Punctuation important. Yadayada Uncle Jack horse. Nah, never beat around bush people like that. direct honest gauge respect request. (in case, her), make sure know they're going get business again. People need feel consequences behavior. Shallah, also Burtzev? California mediocre job best. absolutely tattoo without issues. could make case bars, restaurants, etc., tattoo shops something everyone city frequent like that. seven months in, California's fault letting job. Unless wanted money months really place blame California letting work safe manner. almost like want go point. anyone supporting herd immunity anymore? connection black people far less Vitamin due higher melanin, makes Vitamin supplementation urgent black people cold climates 

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Children aged ≥10 years shown transmit SARS-CoV-2 school settings.

**What added report?**

Twelve children acquired COVID-19 child care facilities. Transmission documented children least 12 (26%) 46 nonfacility contacts (confirmed probable cases). One parent hospitalized. Transmission observed two three children confirmed, asymptomatic COVID-19.

**What implications public health practice?**

SARS-CoV-2 Infections among young children acquired child care settings transmitted household members. Testing contacts laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases child care settings, including children might symptoms, could improve control transmission child care attendees family members. I'm willing bet 100 years another pandemic history repeat Compared freezer -4 easily? feel like difference vaccine quality mostly logistical nature, determines cost, thereby value - assuming safety efficacy similar. vitimin racist now? love copy pasted response multiple comment threads. use insult frequently. think clever.

Normal it’s mom don’t get chance say goodbye to. ask idiots calling it’s hoax wanting get back work hurt soul. Lockdowns masks work. LOL. elaborate nightmare part? Hey now... critical thinking for.... critical thinkers, suppose. TLDR: People wear masks still exposed small doses virus.

These doses may large enough cause symptoms could still large enough induce immune response. wearing mask getting small viral doses, may actually build immunity Covid 19. acedemic opinion piece NEJM, study like hypothesis noted expert. NEJM one top medical journals world. 

As said another comment proper term process called inoculation (medical professionals usually use term 'variolation'). small pox kept check. would take pus open wound small pox patient, put pin head poke arms yet it. enough viral dose provoke immune response. George Washington troops one key winning revolutionary direct link piece NEJM doctor part online counts whole groups don’t Suit yourself. appealing philosophy understand horrors leads to. think Norway 'Democratic Socialist' (made phrase) rather oil emirate large welfare state, recognize Socialism Holodomor, Scandinavian states. Yah teachers need strike need back baffle all. described Republican party really, even large portion Democrats too. that, instead protesting masks, free healthcare affordable housing.

It always sad American. Senator Iselin 2020.   beloved tattoo shop worked best team ever closed could shoulder financial burden operating 7 months. two bosses amazing, smart, savvy people good business good tattooing. got SBA loan really cover months expenses put us debt. shop meeting two days ago could tell us closing. pain eyes tremendous. One moving state feel like failed us. feel like failed them. long term shop - place could finally put roots struggling establish career last 9 years. 

To watch crumble dust right front me. kind small business rent forgiveness would different. moved location last October built shop perfect gorgeous. location prime untapped market took lot convincing property management high class place place bikers hung get cheap tattoos. 

It’s devastating there’s “happy glimmer” around edges it. dreams effectively strangled last 7 months. One bosses couldn’t even get unemployment kids feed.

Deaths go least 10 days significant rise infections. Everyone knows deaths usually occur 10 days getting covid-19 virus. cases, takes month cases end death. Also made mentions lockdowns. assumption deaths would going already. won't. 

We went back June U.S. Everyone saying cases going way deaths going matter time deaths went back up. Sure enough, went back July. Also expect big jump WORLDWIDE Brazil going slow likely Europe may pick back up. proven deadly less conpared common flu.

Source? No.

Even countries fuck *very badly*, funny watch famines, poverty, economic collapse, pandemics, civil wars kill multiple orders magnitude human beings.

Many victims make decisions led directly deaths. anti-maskers die disease, voted POTUS. say Right. tsunami alarms fear mongering. They’re still great save lives. Everyone glad alerted us afraid of. Nah. idiots yelling LIBERTY! understanding liberty ends next person’s begins. proper term ""inoculation"" 

this small pox kept check. would take pus open wound small pos patient, put pin head poke arms yet it.

American I'm curious mean this. need first drink disinfectant... brother going back school weeks (Orange county) numbers starting look good. wife MIL grew Fargo. family members still living there. One Thanksgiving MIL's sister visited us NYC mentioned first time ever met Black person MIL brought friend home college. would Fifties. lady obviously racist even today little exposure Black Hispanic people. huge fan current president. hard make people like suspicious motives anyone look like her. Republican officials everywhere exploiting suspicion. Yeah, know. said, American people value freedom point dicks it. ""effective lockdown"" response beginning. fact they're still happening result inaction containing virus first place. Well world goes shit That's good guess, state thousands kids quarantining outbreaks happened within first week. There's college 45 minute drive nearly 2K cases week. basically college know that's testing near couple hundred cases week.

Quite frankly, believe reports k12 school BS responses I've seen parents actively trying avoid testing children. see crowded hallway kids pop positive school response ""well, we'll quarantine one class. crowded hallways half kids maskless fine less 15mins. School continue"" know can't trust anything. places schools opened person classes There's cover everyone teachers. That's soon judge ""peak"". need allow time pass. One week lower 7-day average necessarily mean trending overall. technical definition Sweetie, never said lives matter. do. believe they’re hand corporate tobacco overlords.

But really, you’re making false equivalence, there’s sense arguing further. Continue delightful echo-chamber doom. effective vaccine? also outsourcing countries africa. Really getting around 2.5%... 2%... even 1% think online curbside pickup great. perfect better screwing around store

And pandemic people refusing wear masks politicizing whole situation wrong. Care rationed either geographies. Also, sitting spot hour least. windows open poorly ventilated, that's worse public transport. 

If gonna 4 hour bus ride cold heat on, yeah, could imaging public transport worse restaurant, people wearing masks extended periods time.

I'm continously amazed many redditors posting sub understand differences risk based situation one virus spreads. Yeah, lota problems here..   Wtf isn’t fear mongering it’s bare bones reality 

Just bc ur angry react negatively everything doesn’t mean guy giving basic scientific reality fear mongering 

Get  Science fucking cool. know everything sucks doomed but...damn. Science sure come long way. thought post sarcastic enough, apparently not...


I'm asking question: used racial purity, linguistic purity, cultural purity...


Because want realise concept purity wrong.


It's moronic ""us vs them"" mentality, realising ""us"" cannot defined justify idea purity. N95 + eye protection gold standard. Next KN95s, careful fit. Medical/surgical masks effective cloth. life me, can't understand national push get everyone steady supply ormsirgical masks vs. haphazard ""just put something face"" approach right now. US call person fucking moron. Feels evocative, admittedly cunt roll tongue better. won't. You’re going sauce us please True. took 6 months give following guidelines ""i needed live life/I can't live fear,etc: Car accidents transmittable cause death.

yeah, are. typically involve multiple vehicles, likely increased traffic. guess favor banning cars makes consistent, even consistently hysterical. Right. scenario (if proves out), would need people actually exposure. Ironically doesn’t help much everyone super good behavior. 

Sort like vaccine trials — can’t ethically expose people intentionally screen people public enough chance exposure. We've also gotten better keeping killing people. Normal + enjoying normal = worse normal. Even without lockdown way I'm dining outside traveling hell talking about? didn’t cite experts. linked two editorialized articles used flimsy evidence pull nonsense right ass. clearly absolutely idea talking Same. Taking turmeric supreme 2x/day. Oh lose. use. Lol. read report. detailed. skewed. average age study 60 undying issues doubt accuracy report. doubt effects majority confirmed cases. . Oh wow.

I could go point ""people need make living"" invalidated denial people tobacco industry meaningful work. 

The article restaurants likely contributer spread Covid. Yet support industry advocate others well. 

So back Hunny realize 200000 US citizens died need House Salad badly. Women Reddit? Far enough away elections eliminate blame? go. good understand graphs? reflect speak of. saying NEW CASES started decrease bit, may true, certainly presenting case strongly. bump cases Sturgis already reflected new case numbers point. result pandemic

*as result lockdowns lot people understand distribution think average. imagine average median? would something. get angry family members gone back normal worse

That sounds like problem lol pure blood french canadian.. youre Native? Metis? French entitled? adore you. Also, myocarditis found alarmingly high rate even mild asymptomatic cases. Even pandemic, undiagnosed myocarditis leading cause sudden cardiac death pediatric athletes. know news stories would pop every young athlete collapsed died field? That's schools associations taking drastic step canceling season- first symptom see young people might field/court/pool experience cardiac arrest.  

Moreover, entire reason other""common cold"" coronaviruses mild, tend stay upper respiratory tract, exposed numerous times throughout childhood, gaining cell-mediated immunity time. That's little kids get numerous colds per year time 50 can't remember last time cold (although downhill 65 so).

Germany virus control. Someone local FB community selling masks say “I’d rather get Covid-19 Biden-20” found gross insensitive. almost commented it, know would go.

People short sighted. get sick? briefly paused trials resumed India. way good virus first detected Wuhan late last year city underwent draconian 76-day lockdown 

i like we're going pretend never saw chinese government welding people apartments, grabbing street disappearing camps; 'draconian', that's it? single adjective? world leaders honest people got shock required do, whether liked not.

Hey there... know certainly wish hope able live long happy life. take care, fellow human. Pray woman 👏🏻 kind hope masks stick even said done. would love people US wore masks they’re sick like many asian countries. You’re lucky sick leave states there’s reason people shouldn’t everything prevent spread normal cold flu. Trump, alt? could worse going back normal? Lol “28 Days Later” pretty well known movie virus turns people zombies. plane used (stupid)

This funny true. absolutely hate fear mongering articles like this. [Yeah deep would say less Canada, example? thanks math this... yes, cutting virus's prevalence group setting. :: Laughs Floridian ::  hate saying absolute truth! :( really gonna ""all lives matter"" fact 200k people died Covid last 6 months?

Come certainly meant mischaracterised studies utilized media confuse public.

Wishful thinking lol holidays travel within nation vaccine rolled decisions made wrong we’d discover vaccine (remember, thought would likely well year March)

He predicted 12 18 months January, march. He's still track right, vaccine likely *approved* December/January distribution begins. Fauci idea what’s going happen. Plus, Fauci really know vaccine distribution.

I think understand incredibly high-ranking Fauci is. connections EVERYWHERE. anyone. world medicine, Fauci request meeting any-fucking-one scramble make happen. absolutely knows lot vaccine distribution. Fauci’s idea take year properly distribute vaccines likely horseshit. doesn’t provide evidence back guess.

Literally dozens experts said distributing vaccines HUGE hurdle. Google it. Nice one. Everyone talking logistics transport storage, that’s easy part compared convincing everyone inject literal ice veins. Christmas time **2021** then! Yes. One main reasons much spread covid US I’ve much intense drama since March, don’t properly feel things anymore. Things make upset afraid outraged, don’t. don’t headspace worry. Way many cats there. 

It’s true life getting back normal. don’t know it’s American thing. lot people done anxious Covid time. 

People wearing masks kid gets screened Covid multiple times day, sometimes. Restaurants increased spacing. people stay away. people idiots others unlucky. us vote Trump last time again.

Our system broken. Oh wow! long Merlins-cats running around, screwed. well, couple fringe cases, yeah. point clear that's never going happen again.

RemindMe! 6 months make snarky reply post. everyone supposed say fuck it? Let’s let thing run rampant. cares many people die need go BBQ that’s used do. Couples fight money in-laws quite bit. There's unemployment underemployment. may disagreements handle pandemic. things stress families unfortunately. busy making 9/25 national lobster Yes, listen teacher. lazy! right Trumpkins? Don’t know Korea, Japan everyone constantly sneaking 10 minute naps every chance get. It’s national pastime. It’s also really surprising given many paramedics called situations involve mentally ill patients whose behaviour unfortunately unpredictable they’re crisis points. 

This clickbait article. like first 4 months so. started seeing friends small groups. went back college first 2-3 weekends stayed home. long time ago started asking tf staying home everyone else gonna go spread it. disease still gonna spread widely I'm gonna playing video games home reason could enjoying last year college. get back 100% normal. That's guarantee whole time. matter long take. Thanks covering me! You’re seriously going keep years? we’ll herd immunity anyway. won’t necessary. I’d rather give organ live COVID hell even another six months.  35-40% Americans sub 90 IQ nitwits vote cultism. could give two shits spread kill. amount people affected virus result speed limits? smoking, some? Nice see real reports without much added flavor. kind want go get bowl Chipotle put hour 400* see happens. Yes, damn kids parties invited back campus, even though forbade it! /s difficult would be, American family speaks English, move Germany? We've discussing leaving shitshow Trumpster Fire lasts another 4 years March 12 last day felt ""normal"" me. got circadian rygbem Bach. traveled before. they’ve shown us many morons live amongst us...that’s main eye opening thing me. saying grandma clearly ounce empathy towards people like risk, ok go infecting people set poor example handling this, mental physical health majority folks whole lives ahead suffer people like her? 
Wow. Talk entitlement. actually people dense comment makes be? Mass media def cover much panic-inducing shut trial........ requirement district clean desks classes? I'm pretty sure fomite transmission incredibly rare. Yep 100% people post bullshit socials Oof size large Spain France Italy similar terms able leave home. West took example dictatorship China...  keep telling need stop consuming COVID news (especially negative sub's news) 6 months hibernate focus bettering myself. really need lol worst case: obvious cause transverse myelitis vaccination, Oxford (correctly) resumed trial anyway single event trial size can't confirm reject TM common side effect. way find keep running trial.

If resumption forgone conclusion, struggle think justification pause ass-covering showing Astra Oxford ""care"" (at potential cost thousands lives). pandemic definitely exposed weaknesses hyper-efficient manufacturing (which runs 24/7 can't really increase production beyond normal anticipated demand) just-in-time inventory. made chuckle. College football back get ready spike. difference numbers pretty important...

It's speed limits acclimatising mean always state extreme anxiety flight vs fight response that's causing existential dread every day go work school multiple active cases covid past week know I'll spread something student lives grandparents could possibly kill I'll get something student possibly die come shapes sizes.

Some shapes sharp unpleasant fit. &lt;3 /r/boringdystopia  marginal risk big enough overwhelm hospitals. play fire. think sarcasm. talked buddy moved private college Iowa said zero protocols place. masks, full classrooms, full dorms, etc. going get worse Iowa continue downplay virus .. much death acceptable you? Spain France thought control. record number daily cases....

Sweden run armaggedon widely predicted... cases now. highest death per capita Peru draconian lockdow. human behind person you’re talking to. 

So I’m sorry I’ve said strikes nerve you. you’re situation causes COVID, I’m truly sorry. something help, will. jokes, animosity. 

I fortunate enough get valuable degree job wasn’t directly affected COVID. doesn’t mean everyone care isn’t suffering. doesn’t mean I’m helping can. don’t know won’t share whole life situation internet. sucked ways well, financially. I’ve made best bad situation. I’m rich live lavishly. happiness *is* choice I’ve able get point *could* live “new normal” another year came that. 

But know it’s tough there. It’s bummer reddit quickly hate anyone anything suffering... Im writing read wife said Fauci kiss ass 😐 I'm risk, son. point I'm tired garbage thinking old folks saying ok conform common sense empathy towards others tail end lives care get sick die. want open restaurants movie theaters go lives live virus got fuck rest. 
It surprise country huge problem apathy comes neighbor, long affect personally.
Fuck people think like that. even slap wrist. get real consequences, won’t get real managing things better. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article high. Probably similar flu age group. Yeah, it’s fucking crazy people actually think that. god. Theyre entirely related. I've explained multiple times.  Fucking idiots Yep, solution carve US smart dumb states.  system completely failed. pandemic completely exposed this. can’t fix margins. Whatever set last 200 years made possible. realise government actively covering covid restrictions dont you? can't make example someone theyre themselves. would anyone want close proximity someone fever? Maybe real vaccines masks wore along way. bet hat vast majority anti-mask reopen campaigns foreign money think socialising normal behaviour young people. Whether always takes form party another thing. see lot young people socialising blame all. No, knew asymptomatic presymptomatic spreading early on.

Definitely early mid March. govt telling us masks worked stop spreading it.

In fact fear asymptomatic transmission greater early on. We've found since asymptomatic transmission definitely occurs, lot asymptomatic hosts carry low viral loads regularly shedding much it.

Presymptomatic transmission hand always driving factor. remember experts saying may contagious 24+ hours start showing symptoms back primarily China, Iran, Italy (or least major outbreaks knew about, realistically point already community spread close everywhere). Comparisons like invalid. Sweden size small US state far better US states got board panic, like New York. There's wide variation US states, like Europe.

Neither case count case mortality rate comparable jurisdiction begin with, though, testing regimes population dynamics differ vastly.

Excess mortality much better metric, measure Sweden fared worse average severe flu-season Well, two seperate issues. dont eat healthy exercise, doesnt put neighbors risk heart attack....just me. India's probably going beat U.S. rate. Conspiracy theories used mostly harmless back day Social medial. Social media changed that. Social media makes propaganda 10x effective, cheaper easier spread. Jesus said ""love thy neighbor,"" build wall cut HUD funding better control gets one.  employees work restaurants, maybe badly need money. Must stressing.   Well people believe Q anon bs. Yep, first reaction ""not shit wsj"" convince people money travel buy shit. convinced many conservatives. live small community insurance broker posted community Facebook page us wearing masks unknowingly worshipping Satan. many people privately said they’re looking new broker.   understand, article validates point perfectly? expected lower CFR india due young population that's roughly observed. numbers I'm reading show almost perfect scaling age. article debunking india's low fatality rates come good response.

Are reading article? Seems lot countries feel way. part clueless, inexperienced sheeple substitute social media reality.  Bless poor brainwashed soul wake someday. It’s Easter bunny. deaths started right time. opinion relation politics. It’s simply matter fact. guy champion bird-flu, swine-flu, Zika, HIV etc... helped country greatly well others. I’m saying know late 2021 back normal?

Also, remember told regular public national TV didn’t need masks, giving hard time. knew damn well masks would help, didn’t want first providers able access them. Even understand, lie public longer count opinion anymore. saddens matter country, same. Middle class pushed low income and.. feel horrible poor struggle even now. fixed. sickening wealthy get richer kept nice remote working jobs. I've unemployed whole year thanks corona. Yea Americas shrank 32% What's point ""herd immunity"" articles contradict notion state asymptomatic infections still wreck cardiovascular nervous system? last time ate sit-down mid-March (before started closing lot places down) seafood restaurant. Oh lucky! wear mask day work (I work outside) time go allergies bad, worse new place new pollens. Maybe next spring better adjusted. difference lockdown is, fail lockdown, place hopes vaccines, fail vaccination, fucked.

You hope afterlife 😂 normal circumstances right. covid, individuals *have* ordering bulk suppliers like granger. Plus lot business pushed same, even need bulk amount, store shelves empty. that, not, large, insignificant amount medical professionals find ppe. think would way worse happened March  gotten curbside local pub/restaurant times last couple weeks new cases down. find mildly entertaining sit outside watch people walk parking lot mask on, remove sit bar drink bad Oxnard :X. 2nd wave always felt prepping done right sounded smart. Profiteering disaster awful thing do. people did. small town, word gets around. wonder effects long term low level exposure would be? rate infection US, reality. long term immunity may may continuum short term responses repeated mitigated viral load exposure. Also, deniers ones said co-morbidities, especially obesity. want shame people bodyweight, see risk factors covid look mirror, would think twice declaring ""it kills old weak."" 'Might' 'could' Technically still blunt force trauma. Czech Republic trending good either. Masks great certainly help slow spread. personal theory increase asymptomatic cases fact summer people actually vitamin systems. could wrong, fear winter bad even masks. help Healthcare workers, essential workers first responders need most. short. catch y'all stay home we'll pay you. soon production everything reopen. high risk segment population continue pay stay home learn effective treatments and/or get vaccine.

This man president! (Hell, better Trump - yeah, know I'm going get banned (again) comment, I'm posting anyway).  That's really bad holy crap. OP trying exact thing here? So, according table, odds 80-year-old person dying within year 5.8%.

The odds 80-year-old person dying COVID today (emphasis today since know better treat it) slightly higher that.

Meaning 80-year-old person, getting COVID dying different dying health-related issues.

And remember even gets COVID, automatic death sentence: risk-benefit number game point.

If knew grandma going die year, would like enjoy last days Earth: alone nursing home family house loved ones even ended infecting COVID? Jeez buddy tell spend lot time sub  We've told resume hopefully too! suggests won’t same? studies similar every way, except differences pathogen causes myocardial inflammation. given two studies seem nearly identical, it’s reasonable assume outcomes nearly identical well. get that. That’s I’m saying us high risk I’m seeing good way number people already given even prior one. feels like us high riskers going keep isolating thanks assholes won’t wear mask stop partying, combined anti-vax movement. Yeah, trash disposed of. remember seeing Lancet article published China, everyone using, even though sample size three. “IT DOESNT SPREAD AEROSOL, DROPLETS” said. Fuck that. bought M3 spray painting mask, fuck surgical cloth mask.  Yeah, it’s sliding scale 50% case. Either protected less protected. 100% means 100% people get vaccine fully protected infection live virus.

Also, ever suggest getting it? Please quote ever made suggestion since seem implying did. can’t please don’t bring red herrings this. Thanks. makes think I'm troll? I'm 100% serious.

The selfish rednecks *really* prolonging safe return normal. *really* could opened August done better job listening. Swedes *really* careful us Americans. COVID deadly things last checked ... maybe NOVEL VIRUS flu right? article going eat. kids riding bikes, building ramps - outside active stuff. That's safe right now. You’re welcome, I’m glad understood Oh he's paying - he's thing image *a good dad option leave entire family - temporarily!* already sending child support - it's, three parts, 1. less *should* owe COL area intentionally low income throttled ((the courts *impute* it, basically make pay he's obviously voluntarily underemployed, can't that, court order gotten far yet)), 2. afford pay even child support calculation POST-throttling spit still place live without like five roommates ((FTR currently lives mother, sooooo....)), 3. number paying right calculated based upon two kids, three.

So yeah. guess one good thing redo final divorce papers that, although redoing child support worksheet legit going take hour do, number going *way* different. Because, free time hands, he's *voluntarily* working two jobs. baby paperwork too. idea final number sent paystubs (which need order fill forms), mean, point, I'll take anything. Baby almost five weeks sent us even extra dime, box diapers, anything really - that's surprising, mean pretty clear wants nothing baby. even asked photo. he's consistent suppose. tells probably every time communicate, oh, let know need anything help, know got lot plate ((this close apology think I'm ever going get him)) - puts burden ask. I've told - want ask shit, definitely could use it. Like, want help, help - make beg. spent ten years him, latter half involved lot begging (for help kids, attention wife, assistance spouse, etc.) - I'm done begging guy *anything*. conscience getting down, he's welcome put money mouth is. I'm responsible making feel better jackass life decisions. 

My heart breaks son going grow dad, thankfully dad brother around (we live neighborhood - move *some* help) without positive male influences role models. Wow, made sad read. definitely report therapist, completely line unprofessional. 

Oh way, worthwhile stay alive. doesn’t imply duration same. Read friend think lot people don’t understand vaccines work. point isn’t lower chance getting infected, point everybody does, cause virus either die spread low numbers. aren’t living reality mate. Maybe take break reddit make wonder daily infection rates REALLY back March, atleast I'm sheep Guilty charged. initial argument panicking could harm good, could cause people stockpile things need harm healthcare workers made sense me. 


In insight, silly. pretty big collection masks, plan keep using even non-COVID things (eg: flu season)  opinion piece newspaper, directly contradicted let's math. far we've 194,000 people die it. population USA 328,000,000. 

Percentage calculator : 194,000 percentage 328M? Answer: 0.0591%

If take entire world: 921,000 percentage 7.6B? Answer: 0.012% Thats point. mom 70, thats ""how smallpox"". would gotten regular vaccine smallpox vaccine invented 70 years ago. Wait. small dose virus prompt immune response injecting everyone small doses infected people? absurd fear-mongering. Platt doctor, politician claims experiencing long-term symptoms. COVID stay vast majority infected individuals forever. I’m even going entertain herd immunity misinformation spiel, go try someone else today

ETA: known troll, anyone else reading don’t even bother mode attack directly immune system may evolutional pressures become less virulent. Oddly enough, even President gets it.

I read numerous articles papers 1980's subject. 

Unfortunately pre internet. 

Forestry experts unanimous warnings Bill Clinton made policy change, ignored political reasons. 

I'm glad make bad decisions politics today /s  think they'll it. Boris sacrifice economy save pensioners.

Since first wave testing much available. we've learned treat virus effectively. time let run population. Temp checks useless.  vaccine human history ever 100% Jesus fucking Christ masks vaccine, masks give autism /s  Florida? I’m definitely going part US least year. Whether news over-exaggerates severity irrelevant — take risk?

Play safe, wear mask, follow social distancing guidelines like everyone else here, survive together. Oh no, I'm saying government whole good job. bidding wars states federal government fucks sake. still think binary gamble, chose one time, risked least number American lives. Get great movie! Might start considering equitable zen mastery ♡ long cost life, I'm trying. He’s talking kind normal aren’t mask requirements large concert gatherings allowed late 2021. gradual process diminishing restrictions throughout next year, possible small clamp around upcoming flu season (but unlikely) everyone contracted covid (in US) would approximately 2000 deaths within 30-34 year old age group.

(edit) recent protocols e.g. steroids vitamin hopefully significantly reduce course.  What? bang head dude? We're colonies, dear. try always post archive links nytimes Washington post. subscribe them. wish didn’t paywall articles. Fine me. Trump said 5% fatality rate

The US gov’t corrupt trust Yeah. Whenever see article like this, I’m like “duh, common sense”. It’s fuckin disappointment researchers need waste time due dumbasses don’t know mask help. Bullshit article. Denmark 1 month lockdown first. waited case dropped talking reopening.     
When schools reopened, children taught smaller groups 10-12, sat 2 meters apart classroom, washed hands least [every hour    
Face masks mandatory, forbidden either. gatherings allowed immediate neighbors basically? Seems like odd provision lockdown, especially people still going offices time. FB like neurotransmitter vending machine accept dumb thought payment. outrageous move value. Good thing shut whole country none matter   left Cult Donny. Anyone buy STEM. Degrees universities businesses highest bidders buy ever need. Look President; perfect example modern American dream. don’t live sick individuals

Is everyone live tested regularly confirm COVID negative? not, can't reasonably claim live anyone carrying it. volunteer tribute .jpg college. sustainable. crazy things teachers expected flip teaching fully online, tons potential things spend money support transition: hardware, apps, technical support, training etc. Right. here’s thing: you’re picking choosing. dude, didnt know virus knows sitting down? sigh! :/ say?  competing versus foreigners (out country visas) paid less hold less rights fight bosses. Welcome globalization welcome new way things. name class haha. CIDRAP podcast, infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm, MD, says data presented article saying mask-wearing helps inoculate others covid. (Great podcast!)

He also says belief unproven approach may cause people let guard down.

By way, TWIV (This Week Virology) also great podcast! Like someone else mentioned, UFO conspiracies existed decades never spiraled control recently. UFO believers mostly harmless imo. new shit however spreading like wildfire I'm (like many others here) speechless find society now.  early 1900's shit. none friends live sick compromised individuals? 

Do pass anyone public lives sick compromised individuals? 

Do realize could spread people, spread sick compromised individual?  Bro it’s piece cloth face. really think government going enforce crazy shit bc allowed mandate something harmless putting piece cloth mouth?  Jesus boomer bullshit mindset trash normally Im defending guys. You’re whole argument seems “Im right Im old! somebody age, agree me.”

Nobodys gonna stop hugging flirting girls nightclubs hermits want lifestyle validated. would like every single one believes virus real catch go hospital it. arrive multiple organ failure doctor like, acting go home, drink hot tea.  Theaters already open states... You’re free never sit theater again, Fauci. lmao way move goal posts judgement person actually experienced disease?

how judgement actual scientists? scientists saying saying asked doctor antibodies test basically told point since it, ut probably confers immunity 3 months. said authority kind nodded, think anywhere close knowing immunity lengths yet right? re-infections confirmed thing jist something happens freakishly rare number times? international student 17. Even wrong move could get expelled, scholarship cancelled, deported. sure hell didn’t anything stupid regarding law, considering got education. yes, 18 would follow covid 19 orders.

Not every 18-19 sheltered piece crap. people full time job, taking care family siblings. Don’t lump wankers normal functioning people. Let's see comment gets removed per previous ones. Even CEBM saying trend deaths continues downwards indicating recent increase cases leading increased mortality. IFR estimated 0.3% falling every week.

All point lockdown necessary stage. unless deaths start going significantly again. Um... never mentioned anything racism...

(lol jk course right) Yes, Florida sucks even without COVID. It’s partially seniors. 

Not sure assume I’m going defend though. I’m explaining snowbirds like go there. really WHO's recommendation. u/learningsnoo saying there's studies saying people touch face wearing mask get false sense security neglect measures.   People like would could obtain STEM degree save life. bad. Guess ask sister money;)
We need phase low iq people holding us back. 3 weeks ago went shopping center boyfriend try find books bookstore there. shopping center restaurants outdoor dining. making way bookstore, homeless man drugged yelling people. witnessed man go people sitting outside eating straight yelled right faces. good 4 5 inches face face. sealed us. way hell we’re outdoor dining seeing that. He’s 19 13. He’s grown man. get real job. There’s snow removal needed AZ FL seniors go

That's go there, year. Florida alone daily infections Canada, zero couple days ago.

When guys get shit together, start wearing masks ""social distancing"" thing? might start seeing Canadian tourists.

Canadians bit pragmatic way. snow better virus. agree completely.  Massive inoculum. There'll always something. Always answer crazier next. eat up. search theories, also find sites/groups, talks reptilians, flat earthers, hitler still alive, etc. link quote comment history, I'll dig up.

But short, said: Masks help, going fully protect you. continually touch face adjust mask, may hindering you. Keep distance wash hands.

The media essentially jumped ""WHO said Masks help you!""

Edit:

I can't life find original ""don't use masks"" statement, I've read and, memory, along lines posted even original form.

""Masks save ass, kinda help"" said formal manner, can't help every fucking piece media decided headline ""WHO says masks useless"" instead ""The usage masks one step right direction"".

WHO releasing 1 statement per day COVID time, eventually something would easily taken context would show up. can't blame that. blame every single piece media going clickbait title article could find.

Mid post EDIT, ain't rewritting that:

 [Fucking found Here's General Advice Wearing medical mask one prevention measures limit spread certain respiratory diseases, including 2019- nCoV, affected areas. However, use mask alone insufficient provide adequate level protection equally relevant measures adopted. masks used, measure must combined hand hygiene IPC measures prevent human-tohuman transmission 2019-nCov. developed guidance home careb health care settingsc infection prevention control (IPC) strategies use infection 2019-nCoV suspected.  medical masks indicated may cause unnecessary cost, procurement burden create false sense security lead neglecting essential measures hand hygiene practices. Furthermore, using mask incorrectly may hamper effectiveness reduce risk transmission. 

That's word word they've said back January. TL;DR I've said ""masks save ass, kinda help"". saw Tenet. good. Yes. laws granny either! (I'm halfway orphan still follow them.) no, care.  Done *again* second wave ongoing 6 weeks country, still 3 daily deaths. used live 151, bottom road. idea house party? Dude fuck you. live Texas, family lives Texas staying inside everything work groceries. government opening more. Forcing people back work, dumbasses eating infecting others. Still doesn’t mean us taking seriously deserve die. fuck no. Eliminate in,no elections. Long live king Trudeau.  People nuts.   Though we're pretty sure Trump us frantically trying find way November. Nationally 527,000 meat plant workers. Thats ~38 per 100,000 workers. Nationally we’re ~48 per 100,000 people. 3 buildings That’s great, sounds like leaned responsibility faced life courage. like think similarly responsible given cards dealt. 

Again, I’m asking young people absolved consequence. I’m simply asking y’all consider know population biological social standpoint; use knowledge determine need rethink address age group relation COVID. Why? waiters make $$$$. job. cares old someone it? Selfish vs. selfless difficult concepts people. Maybe become clearer later on. There’s solid life lesson 😣 would've fine went Florida too. good day. They’re right place What?

There’s snow removal needed AZ FL seniors go. insulated house still needs heated begin with. 

Maybe it’s big deal you’re from, lot Canadian snowbirds rural Canadian places aren’t great wintertime. Comments like make want listen less, more. Nothing article says late 2021. Eh place kinda toxic want right something wrong about. even matter is. oppose issue matters you, argue nonsense face overwhelming evidence. logic right. social dominance. 31day’s later late one cares breaking lockdown procedures? know, thing everyone calling people 'granny killers' for? so? Thanks. sub love paywall sites crazy. not? fewer deaths per million many European countries + lowest increases cases present day (so second wave). 

It might shock know 73 6000+ dead Swedes 40 years old. means close 98% fatalities people 40. sign reopening definitely bad, especially winter approaches. People need accept need shut whole world restart later Well $hit fOrEvEr I’m already summer 2020. Going restaurant/bar, going office- haven’t wedding summer. people still don’t realize second lockdown lead health crisis young healthy people years come, long term health effects bad economy definitely lead suffering youths covid coming years. Ah yes reassuring know there's VENTILATOR waiting me!! wrong people deserve fined. one hosting parties sensitive time. Old sick people dying naturally disease comparable plane crash. here’s worries me. expect get pushing voting base get infected? They’re aiming voters particular now. Idk wore mask work sometimes (pre-covid, avoiding contamination). feels dirty take put mask again. Bingo know reddit much foreign concept single bar, drinking hitting girls Im gonna give fuck covid try make bring home.  Iranian Hostage Crisis too.

Ronald Reagan George W. Bush really great Presidents. Rinse wash repeat everyone wearing masks vaccine virus dies off.

There reason believe virus ""die off"" citizen action country 1-in-6 330 million people infected/exposed. far likely become endemic (as seems happening Sweden, NYC, Sunbelt, etc) fade background soup things (should) accept living with. mean don’t need shot? yes that's reason, sad...
they really care people, care money... case think governor waited September kids start school. Though, seems every single one us got layoff notices day announced, effective 60 days now. guess they're either replacing us trying make us feel grateful call us back?

If call back... despite issues place, really choice go back. hope finally appreciate fucking place. really fucked us they? It'll last Americans modify behaviors there's vaccine.

It's embarrassingly sad Americans simple things. whatever, troll on. ask definition preprint.

I asked specific one using make confident assertions aerosols major source transmission.

I’m pretty sure don’t actually misunderstood difference “aerosol transmission proven possible” “aerosol transmission proven common.” I’m willing surprised. one think comes close Chinese bus case study. was, know, case study can’t used justify large claim.

I think hoping bluster way based bragging stem backgrounds answering questions nobody asked cover fact don’t actual studies back claims. honest, really like it. hope remains habit even pandemic over.

I'm pretty anti-social I'm psychiatrist cannot pin what, exactly, is, wearing mask public (while others also wearing mask) made much easier get about. I'm wearing mask someone else feel somehow even uncomfortable before.

Maybe shielding face makes comfortable, maybe instant conversation piece, maybe obvious similarity another person. idea. like it. begins, right time, heh

It pretty obvious, months ago, given progress vaccine trials, China's vaccines would start limited deployment around September

It also inevitable US media try demonize vaccine, can't help it, can't allow China look like leader.

What end happen, then, like lock downs it, they'll talk corner, COVID, every vaccine fast-tracked, especially US vaccines based unproven mRNA would otherwise require far testing.

In attempt demonize China, US media will, like lockdowns it, end making much difficult to, time comes, convince people attacked China doing, case take (much more) fast-tracked vaccine.... that's anti-vax becomes factor

The difference lockdown is, fail lockdown, place hopes vaccines, fail vaccination, fucked.  says IFR 0.5% 1%. quickly spreads, even 0.5% IFR going quickly cause lot death. No. Stop. woke.  idea talking about. 220 nm light chance causing eye damage fully absorbed even thing layer water. know, retina behind eyeball, mostly... guessed it, water. feeling politicians items mind:

* Even sane, responsible, electorate, finite time impose limits people for. get fatigued guidelines fall away. US electorate *starts* position 30% electorate 'all there' mentally. Thus socially responsible methodology hard time - particularly need 80%+ adherents real impact rate spread.

* Proper measures, isolation, distancing, etc. would effect infection hit economy, hard. Restaurants, bars, etc. closed, people going out, looking 30% cut GDP. 

* use police enforce rules end going well - many guns, police paramilitary thugs.

Upshot betting, hard, vaccine make go away. Sure lose million people interim, US growing 2m per year, always allow people make difference. Luckily healthcare really funded state, die cheaply silence. all, situation reminds something.

The last time go ED dog bite. wife take Trumpian measure started screaming ""OH FUCK! dog attacking you!"" Little secret, aware. whole hospital kept reminding badly bleeding--again, knew. day could used understatement. question guys, virus transmission wearing masks compare surface transmission? one dangerous higher virus inoculation count?

For example wearing masks infected person coughs you, versus touch infected surface tough nose virus gets in. wondering one dangerous question guys, virus transmission wearing masks compare surface transmission? one dangerous higher virus inoculation count?

For example wearing masks infected person coughs you, versus touch infected surface tough nose virus gets in. wondering one dangerous theory is... exposed virus one single virus time.. could build atleast kind defense infection.. doctor! sure downvoted :/ one. reason virus going away death rate rising. people think would rather risk life (or someone else's) go out. Shortage? China bought US ppe supply. turn around started selling ppe masses. We're even first wave Covid. Spanish Flu, opened schools close like two weeks. took months opening closing things become relatively normal, required laws spittoons general public nastiness. Comforter / duvet / whatever heaviest blanket I’m done... Let guess, middle ground exact moment *you* decided prudent stock up. What's shitty pre-COVID would always stop going bars whenever cold. fucked her. exact same. Everyone FB feed bday parties, going restaurants, basically living pandemic.  knew shit would happen. Primus forbid go country that's done really well containing like Thailand (CDC level 1) There's middle ground ignoring order get offended. Funeral biz...wailing gnashing teeth...

Are still talking pandemic? US France positive test rate atm (5.2%).

Spain really concerning, 11% positive right We're trained tolerate hellish work lives expense else indulge every whim avoid discomforts costs.

Work consume. could fall line, everybody stupid? Victoria getting ridiculous said before, long ur democracy, bad thing can’t happen ur country😉 I've wearing mask autism test day said mildly autistic. Masks cause autism ! would realized isn’t bullshit conspiracy campaign read article.

The plenty data saying came nature spoke of, unfortunate, weak provide incontrovertible evidence virus came nature. Well, I'm fucked point, care I'm least cool person whole office.

I never take mask off, want talk me, need wear yours. walk around public areas without mask, want give stupid anti-mask opinion work hours, report HR. care life, would silly care job.

Protect yourself. Put writing. Ask clarification mask policy, writing. put bullshit. die want upset anyone. Fuck 'em.

If want harrass that, report HR. want fire asking comply state local law, enjoy new vacation house. yet death rates continue rise (and article) talking masks working, they're referring hypothesis masks may build immunity allowing us slight exposure virus. That's much new concept. Honestly, think part public's initial fear masks based fact felt looked ridiculous them. Yeah anti maskers still there, lot folks started buying could accessorize. Everyone whos sucking China's dick taking right measures now?

is time west unwilling take experimental vaccine?

All jokes aside hope works. current line vaccine candidates seem bad I'm assuming it'll fine.. work hospital bunch us wanted mask mid march became official us. trying get masking going early feb.  Damn it’s competitive...and always say India future human race, wrong?! Hope work. someone realizes something important upcoming difficulty buys enough make sure they're secure *before* news talked it, they're nutjob prepper.

If news, they're *hoarder*. saw fast spread suggested started wearing one. mind all. slightly uncomfortable worth peace mind it. know hurt wear one not? Plus feel little bit low key kind cool me. Sweet balls. think would gotten better politicians media spin scare... Science dissecting molecular nature thing. Thinking disinfecting procedures, ever baked dashboard cookies? No. aren't. Dr. Henry told us going try flatten curve--not extinguish wait vaccine. means allowing virus spread controlled fashion. Universal masking would likely prevent happening, basically sticking guns. 

It's reasonable course action. 

The options wait months poorly tested vaccine, years properly tested one. based currently fantastical notion safe, effective vaccine even made.

Flattening curve prudent strategy. thing is, human-only diseases pretty benign. big reason many diseases deadly adapted living nicely within us, animal. diseases desperately want vaccines least animals lives in. Diseases want kill host, much want destroy land live on, bad long term survival, cross species longer optimized replicate without overtaxing host get plagues. think might reason many countries like Thailand managed control outbreak people diligently wore mask everywhere everytime. asymptotic people serious cases all. Death count around 50. April 2022! LOL, I'm moron. LOL!  numbers way off, possibly factor 20. vaccine dose weighs 5g, 100g appear using. Moreover, vaccine transported planes bulk, diluted packaged destination.

In short, nonsensical numbers nonsensical. wife essential. made sure shit work much possible. terrifying. least vaccines coming. obviously? seemingly strong correlation LEO anti-mask sentiment? It’s thing community too. way make 2020 better making zombie movie /s lol cruises went electric though? Huh. Neat. WEAR FUCKING MASKS PEOPLE!!!! tell close friend died virus take seriously look dead eye. Exact thinking vaccine causes issues say 20 year olds higher rate what's normal.

Emergency Use particularly vulnerable ok, general population. get pricked shoulder strain cowpox(?) believe. nasty like three weeks theres pit arm forever. parents still smallpox shot scars late 60s. ""... unproven promising theory that...""

Hydrochloroquine 2.0? That's tactful way getting though. Though prefer ped office accept patients vaccinate fuck noise. like saying... He's got legs, think that's helps walk? real vaccine antibodies made along way. one tell wear mask, scientific evidence suggested airborne virus going around. Common sense tells protect airways. It’s basic. links there. good question, definitely US least. It’s common people breastfeed past 6 months. Pretty sure it’s tied lack maternity leave healthcare (in terms access resources success) well education benefits it.
Breastfeeding past 1 year even rare pretty stigmatized personal experience. hope get punished this.

She could realistically get 3 years prison. kills someone 5 years. judge bad day could probably get manslaughter put jail longer really think happen. always felt like would logically case I'm glad science backs up. Darwin's law never bad thing. say can't fix stupid, evolution sure can. misremembering, smallpox vaccine old.  said masks make touch face dumb wear n95 mask without special training. like 35% I've suspected since March. lol. jumped full curbside service phone based consults. Love vet. blame them. Besides making money people spend things...

I’m UK, fines wearing seatbelt $10,000? live California, fine $162 USD don’t wear seatbelt. I’m planning moving across country soon, stopping staying hotel night.

All best. That's literally animals - lock torture labs, they're innocent.

I support forced testing anyone consent. adult humans consent this, animals can't. mean, point, they're experienced, developed.

But unreasonable expect teenager little smarter, little considerate. need fully developed prefrontal cortex that. like like either fully developed, all, there's plenty in-between.

Also, record, 10 years ago pretty similar.

But understand coming from. oh!, thanks goodness xD Ya, think make solid point too. Masks outside 100 degree day rough change interactions without expressions real that’s addressable, least.

Thinking people going endlessly what’s safest naive. we? Obviously. also shouldn’t lot things harm create risk, including others accept even us scream bad still is.

Three others know too. know 2 recovered. mine. I’ve back two months I’ve felt comfortable that.  I'm upset much people care anymore. can't go favorite gas station anymore. There's many 10 people w mask sometimes. 

Tomorrow work we're holding appreciation event giving meals customers. tables chairs set like 2019. 100+ people sitting eating shoulder shoulder. ridiculous. people work places? need business. *AND WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED!!!!* bothered would make death threats. mean wacko that?

That said, fully sympathize people feel choice present bodies make point, heartbreaking even needs said, black lives matter. see privilege feel degree urgency. 

You'll never catch protesting mask tho lmao that's dumb af made national news here, also half mile ""next year vaccine"" ain't indefinitely

I really hope vaccine comes November, 100% effective (like Polio vaccine) get back old normal.

I’m worried vaccine won’t come another 5 months, less 100% effective, take another full year force every last person take (or rounded put camps). case, might looking two years economic lockdown, maybe even more. would suck. thought Oxford's vaccine, mRNA vaccines around long iirc saying misleading, misinformed, both. majority people existing data set tested positive elderly. imply overall death rate somehow lower stated disparity rates age groups incorrect.

Yes, I'm aware that. also aware vast majority people died globally 80+ years old?

By including statistics increasing global CFR even though, segmented age groups, CFR 40 incredibly small.

In Sweden alone, less 2% total COVID deaths people 40.

If 80, CFR 3%, way higher; 20, CFR might well zero. interesting! Intuitively would think would opposite goes show need look data/facts first form opinions later vice versa. 

Wonder larger % Americans adopted mask use sooner Canadians, especially given politicization masks social distancing - wonder hit Boston-DC corridor west coast, major population centers therein, first. May Northeast getting hammered mask use social distancing full swing. conjecture, can't help wonder.

Thankyou that. thing I'd curious see date info that's May, I'll digging :). bad honestly, I'm naturally pretty introverted. throw pair noise cancelling headphones though feel isolated. call necessity simple case valuing human lives animal lives. could easily get enough human volunteers even early stages.

Good luck getting retail, fast food, gas stations, etc... moment chose set false dilemma lost me. 

Because I’m choosing consider perspective emerging adulthood doesn’t mean condone behavior.

The “you’re ether us us” justification many used thousands years crush unfortunate enough path. It’s ineffective, intellectually dishonest.

For someone concerned uneducated people, post littered logical fallacies. thank Stop testing animals. deserve it. Testing numbers continuing increase parts Europe, whereas US seems they've massively slowed down. like there's new nationwide restrictions bring cases much come down.  Hope door/cup fee. He’s gonna need it. poor guys, dont envy all. 

I hope wont end like them, although new cases numbers follow pretty much trajectory Safety exactly trials normally long vaccines. receive dosing early, whatever going body happen early.

You need longer trial times phase 3 drugs rate spread much much lower. 

Think chicken pox... Pretty contagious, every kid one school gets time. wait 3 4 yr time span enough placebo group get infected say sure vaccine effective.

Covid different spread quickly easily. see measured effect short period time. 

What know coming trials long immunity be, good data safety efficacy. nice little speech gave, answer question:

If know long term effects, possibly identified long term effects? Putting 'us' US.  doubt statistics correct, mentioning isolation seems misleading best.

Death rates much, much higher people aged 70+ and/or multiple health conditions. would comparatively people categories working (physically demanding) meat plant jobs, group much lower risk overall. I'm guessing really, think mortality rate healthy people aged 20-50 20% national average  make sure it’s random? frequently testing them? Surely nothing mass event weeks ago? Yup, finally surging last states spared. Hopefully numbers start going everywhere turn new epicenter. think that’s simple question answer: doctors endorse millions people around world take safe. test. don’t take scientific advice CPC, take doctors scientists.  *pretends shocked* don’t post stupid shit.

Like going work. over-reaction under-reaction virus caused problems? Jury still out. live world theoretical musing. work major retailer front others, facilities maintenance, asset management. Cooling efficiency operating costs continue driving factors systems, concrete universally agreed upon proof systems designed resultant air quality primary purpose, run without deleterious effect higher MERV filtration. facility replaced 145 tons HVAC. Less third used overall, newer units, efficient, designed differently terms breathable air quality. company far sighted most, including DHUs process 100% outside air, creating air changes per hour, increased positive air pressure buildings. Anyway, day shift gone quarantine. yet get sick.

I mean, what's say symptoms? making basic mistake understanding failing realise virus independent financial hardship people. Financial hardship easily solved government giving money people rather large corporations. virus best solved strong mitigation/suppression actions like lockdowns, contact tracing, testing, quarantines.  two independent solutions political views allow see first one. Fuck Parents well. sons high school outbreak first week 3 health compromises wanted home school best already full waiting list quit sending I’m waiting arrested threatened etc needs federal assistance music industry. Period. People worried music industry know may change drastically (many independent venues going business, small artists can't survive, music agent career may dissapear). highly recommended people donating local artists indy venues. Imagine life COVID-19 can't survive: ticket prices go 100% cuz music agency monopolies small artists survive listen top 100 artists... anyone cares live music please consider helping out, even calling representatives help provide federal assistance music industry. Check NITO NIVA. What? Teachers aren’t willingly putting lives unnecessary risk politicians want to? shocked!

Actually, what's really scary, politicians (and know side is...) win either way:

1. Teachers go in. number get sick die, especially older ones lots experience mentors newer generation. weakens public education, want.

2. Teachers refuse go in. means classes get filled new, inexperienced teachers lack mentorship building culture (at best) long-term subs (at worst). weakens public education, want.

You need understand, GOP wants weaken public education replace religious-based private education institutions. That's Betsy DeVos, someone zero experience public education (not student, teacher, administrator, elected public policy role, nothing) vocal critic public education running federal Department Education.

So important understand debate public education, listening politicians saying ""fixing public education"", GOP's mind, means dismantling it, matter words coming mouth. boss order people ""slow testing down!"".  boyfriend. believes real planned make Gates even richer. sit another room go garden take walk watching tube bs. Lmao laws gone several restaurants currently spending time semi-local tourist location apparently FiL's brother came town thats decide spend time. driving insane. Different levels exist degree inflammation isn’t significant factor. fact inflammation exists significant. Black Mirror fuck. hate people bad things there's limit punishment point getting actual enjoyment high level sadism much different them. Never mind people ended prison murdering rapists like many false convictions get pinned people. war 18 years deaths 2,977 people. people wanted war even wear mask deaths 200,000. went way order ""freedom fries"" blasting patriotic songs. consider elderly people health issues important. 

I'm worried face going get stuck ""what fuck"" expression often I'm using lately. economy puts food people's table. provides strong health care present future. matter lives well. People die recessions depression. Even independent shop getting online glasses, glasses prescription means spending least $400 decent quality lenses eye exam. want contacts, it’s even eyes tolerate specific brand daily wear contacts. Trust me, I’ve shopped around price compared that’s cheapest go. 

And would even cataract issues like mom transition lenses. people complicated eyes. Yellow vests? OOTL, could explain? comment directed wording specifically, observation groups absolutely take advantage whatever leeway find force. Like comfortable middle-class families healthy kids taking advantage accommodations set disadvantaged :( Best luck kids, please stay safe!  Could , might ass turns true, know whether laugh cry CDC mis-guidance recommend masking beginning pandemic. Shouldn’t sympathy individual’s actions based upon likely take alternative act said action? individual guided subjective experience nothing else. societal perspective need condemn actions, don’t think ignore state individual either pass judgment solely based society’s interests. legal ethics considerations societally broad ethics take account interest society greater individual individual ethics consider individual I’m trying bring little latter conversation, nothing more. people irresponsibly hike wilderness unprepared, started billing expenses involved search rescue effort save them. mechanism recoup costs treating COVID-19 cases result blatant disregard gathering limits? time I'm grateful kid got lesson, time feel horrible parents got hit financial bus... Someone clearly taught basic human decency.... birthday something, invite 2-3 friends. state, districts looking ""guest teachers"" requirement needed sixty hours college credit ""anything"". missed rhinovirus, basically main cold virus. Theres coronaviridae comparison.

I've pneumonia myself, caught black mould, multitude chest infections illnesses. Exactly this. Tell Steve went shit earlier always stinks adult who’s influence hormones

Uhhh....you realize literally every human influence hormones right? That's kind point hormones - regulate physiology. Poland, Belarus lately 2 weeks. seen eyes. Hospitals crowded see bodies lying streets. sick people everywhere either what's point??

Do really believe government numbers? 🐑🐑🐑  stupids gather together vast country let us isolate properly. could super free stop fucking around care. know that... stupid people follow guidelines can't read Wonder health risks staying cocoon 6 months straight? Can’t good that’s certain How... American.  honestly believe need second lockdown government needs give support businesses getting hit hard lockdown , believe need second lockdown schools reopening , like go constantly saying social distance contact , cram 100 ish people tiny hallway hourly basis eating lunch social distancing enforced seems like teachers staff care students (sorry rant bad formatting) Lol Yes did. Also praise sacrificed lives health, little outrage draining FDNY health fund current administration. then? *fatality rate*. rate catching coronavirus, dying.

Your math assuming EVERYONE US already coronavirus, untrue.  Honestly I’d 100% fine kids going school government would offer income every parent stay home. Many families can’t keep kids home work survive. also can’t afford caretaker either since school normally free. government done shit job helping anyone all. It’s shit show. Coronavirus never go away without vaccine since government won’t help people! Thank You! America least, initial instruction wear mask except healthcare supposedly prevent run masks. knew condition society look close friends relatives... ah well. I’m sure public too. we’re willing make trade offs understanding putting everyone bubble 18-24 isn’t unrealistic, it’s petulantly naive  Couk. He’s harassing posting false statements across subs I’ve posted morning, unrelated covid. Pathetic. HIV herd immunity. we?

Herpes Simplex herd immunity. we?

HPV herd immunity. Prior vaccine becoming available, we?

Answer above: good place. ""herd immunity"" actual thing. Shut take upvote!

Always good see Farnsworth quote. Yeah, right, sorry, coping mechanism lol  hurt feelings. lol said wouldn’t surprised, could still happen fall. agree border though. Trump wanted isolationist. Well, choice. Yeah, brutally murdered 37 children dissected pleasure, dislocated lower jaw one killing them, went drunk rampange ran 11 people one siberian husky.... *hormones man*....... doubt Covid deadly even healthy young people. flu. I'm convinced much deadly regular flu, kills million people worldwide every year, amount Covid killed.  Nah, boomer wearing mask since March 9th. But, boomer I'm living with, started sanitizing packages, wearing gloves, mask face shield, wants wear face shield. deny virus think planned. cannot believe much person changed. dont even use Facebook, account rarely visited, notice gone. track way.   ""bah, we've barely touched this, increase mean much"" - South Dakotan best impression Florida man months ago, Interesting. Spain, everyone still wearing masks, people take seriously. exceptions young people congregate large groups masks off. 

I, unfortunately, one new cases bringing total Europe. followed protocols, used common sense, don’t know caught it. 50% friends UK went Spain sunny places June. 

It early holidays imo. mean, rather telling go google it, could cite instead? bf northern territory work, Rona affected much yet, mask use low there, headed back Ottawa I'd expect mask use high given fact outbreak still far less severe cities size(and less states). 

But given Ontario freaking spike 100 cases day, state literally 10x worse(and far worst) continuing reopening - idk, seems like serious discrepancies COVID culturally viewed handled. 

Seems like one country much, much better other, much cohesive national strategy quarantine trace cases. perfect(and Canada perfect country, government fucks sure too) Canada one major advantage, less people - think difference severity pandemic chalked alone. basically, educated guess. Sorry, told throw parties large get together black white. clear trying excuse behavior using age hormones excuse.

What's point law people break get little tired kept inside? Testing still way low rate growth insane. I’m also Missouri thankfully I’m Kansas City wear mask. Anytime leave though it’s crazy one wears smaller towns. Cases compiled third party sources, many states barely testing. Montana really bad right now, they're barely testing. Oh, great, another country thinks 'economy' important saving human lives. Wonderful.

 
Who's going tell can't economy most/all people dead harmed virus longer work? see lot people social media saying want go work air quality outside (California). think created slippery slope ""lock downs"". Soon want go work freeways dangerous (people die every day 405!) etc. Poe's law There’s much thought put unfortunately it’s politics like everything else days community largely unmasked say wearing one showing support president’s opponent county releases case data, states compile release, cdc compiles releases. discrepancies publicly viewable websites like worlometers covidtracking get data directly states. federal government can't really doctor case data without called It’s evil drive without seatbelt, yet laws it... guess might well living 1940 Germany!! MUH RIGHTS!! ""I pay paycheck taxes! Shut watch child low wages!""

My spouse high-risk COVID complications panicked go back classroom. summer long, school refused provide answer going do, finally last week saying going ridiculous in-person + simultaneous remote schedule. Obviously spouse beyond panicked said...you know what? treated like professional, even human point. quit. I'll take care us make work long need.

And did. school long-term veteran teacher nothing highly-effective reviews. care, hire replacement experience 1/2 price. community care either, value education.

America, 2020. getting downvoted wtf? people even read comment entirely days what? don’t think degree inflammation concerning statistic.

really? dont different levels exist?

(I'm downvoting voting btw. something know little think discussion good) like getting shocked electric fence trying counter gripping harder. Wild speculation heavily biased news source directly contradicted every single shred independent hard evidence. moment see sick people, they’re gonna say they’re paid actors. It’s lose lose situation like said. still understand determined level inflammation likely similar... especially even measure it? I'm young, I'm gonna idiot kill immunocompromised people selfish need party. knew testes ACE2 virus use never heard effects yet. studies that? hear infertility? beg differ.  Haha! thought came out! Check post history don’t believe Can't drive RV Canada Vietnam though. employer (a construction general contractor) requiring masks early on. We've good mask discipline job sites shut lot sites due infections. Wearing masks uncomfortable, works. Nobody knew Imagine thinking allowed throw house party middle deadly pandemic authoritarianism LMAO. tweest! article, University Washington's Institute Health Metrics Evaluation? understand anectodal means, used incorrectly. meant hypothesis based someone's perception experiences. could notice foxes commonly seen night hypothesise nocturnal actually created experiment prove that, hypothesis reliable anectodal evidence

In case obviously bit substantial looking data mask usage severity infection still untested observation testing back I’m glad worked you, however, don’t know don’t lose sleep knowing majority people IRL wearing mask wearing mask properly. must anxiety-ridden mess. typically condone violence, let alone response violence, FUCK person absolute hell ever beating justified definitely own. Pathetic. Yeah. young people (who less likely hospitalized) tested now.

In March/April huge shortage pretty much everywhere testing chain, test supplies like swabs up. pretty much reserved severe cases. Like what? suppose cruise ship industry shut down. like one wearing mask. We're dumber plants, us humans. understand zero this? good portion US currently pretending German, unfortunately trying emulate 1930’s era Germany. Wait see becomes mandatory take vaccine travel, send kids school even get health insurance. Rudolph rest reindeers need masks too. frontline workers. honest even notice irrationally wrong number was. billionaires sure know brainwash recruit fucking morons destroy countrymen’s lives. sorry loss. bot, correct? 
And not. ..seriously, much get paid post way do? true,, friends obviously intelligent. value health understand devastating effects later. Can’t trust numbers anymore GOP control Covid data. far I’m concerned every day deadliest day can’t trust government provide real numbers, false numbers meant inflate Trump’s ego misinform population true severity. signups month ago ... I’m assuming filled (I applied wasn’t selected) Fauci optimist see. Fuck moron volunteer yourself? life valuable prison? Newsflash, life isn’t valuable, want things move faster? Go volunteer vaccine trial instead sitting ass typing selfish self centered comments. theory gets stopped pretty much anything, including layer dead skin cells everyone has, can't make thru eyeball retina.

Still theory. would need exceptional testing deploy random bars such. Okay, one small piece commentary. tells that, covid continues deadly flu, currently far less prevalent. words, chances encountering someone sick contagious covid significantly less chances encountering someone flu. Dude youre reddit echochamber. No1 gives fuck anything else doomsday covid. Save energy. Wrong. It’s work online Okay cool. continue function society even go necessary, proper protection (masks, etc). enforced.

Unfortunately society can't function without cars wish would show cowards face. No, definitely know idea ""challenge studies"" discussed. believe Project Warp Speed considering backup setbacks.

But I'm like 98% sure that, now, none major vaccine studies done challenge studies. It’s outdated concept. Everyone well tracked found arrested don’t show court. concept made sense centuries ago courts little power find someone way make people show hold property hostage. Nowadays primarily keep poor jail trials (or agree waive rights plea deal try get jail earlier).

Edit: Back normal? inventing time machine? Shits changing people, good adapting thrive species. didn’t forget. It’s necessary treat ranch town Idaho even farm towns upstate New York like NYC. real issue continues lack testing numbers one trusts.

We also completely failed stop travel early enough. Treating like natural disaster wouldn’t helped problem. Oh I'm sorry. sucks. Half lot still supporting still good. American selfish?  Okay regardless driven car pretty much day, risking life road make job time. could slide road crash, body crushed wreckage, could collide someone texting, car unrecognizable. dont ban driving save lives we? accept risk life despite many people died since cars invented. Corrupted, though possibly also incompetent. like elections, Republicans end unemployment benefits refuse funds states refuse reopen even Biden wins january lot january people starve death take back could ride bike outside without parents worried someone kidnapping me. able go play friends couple streets coming home dusk. No, wouldn’t. anything would take longer, we’ll reach herd immunity enough people either inoculated recovered. Dakota's country in? Remember Matrix said 1999 peak human civilisation. Deaths still around 1k day probably rise gets colder. Uh...why? disagree fucked up, exact NUMBER guy said issue. Whether 0.1% 30%, care, wrong say shit like period. literally talked whole portion population expendable sake economics.

Were even acknowledging fucked up? I'm really confused. Canada New Zealand? think Moderna candidate (rather Pfizer one) one could potentially stop virus spreading. virus can't even propagate upper respiratory tract. initial stages unknown pandemic, especially know full extend pathogens effects, 'assume' going okay risk locking down. initial lock downs happened precisely lack information. People routinely forget different stages 'awareness knowledge' call wildly different, resulting strategies. worn Thursday woke raging headache middle night Friday morning. Started thinking Covid. Turns unknowingly drinking decaf coffee two days. Ooof. Didn’t take long feel better caffeine Advil, rough morning.  Riots yeah downvote you. think meant obvious people can't read beyond what's written. It’s Gilbert Gotfreids mother People separated months, Thanksgiving Christmas unmissable year many Anyone thinks economy dictated stockmarkets last 30 years ignorant. 90% stocks owned 10% people. That's it. basis reality. great time introvert. Broken bones serious injuries requiring hospitalization. self-entitled, privileged, dumbass piece shit. doctors nurses full PPE working overtime risking lives. Meanwhile, petulant children think world revolves around think minor inconvenience like wearing mask important someone else's health personal space, and, know, getting shit you. level brainwashing people must undergone boggles mind.

You right wear mask? Well others right personal space health, businesses right refuse entry private property. mention states literally law requiring it. Rights apply you, people around rights well. I've trying figure sign lol can't find anything area yet (which weird, I'm big city clinical trial dot gov page lists area). I'd prefer neither :) **block** move Keep living fantasy country solution problems. ain't. We're messed other. Fats bad gonna die know know everyone knows Numbers completely different thing ""being related pandemic"" common? No, don't.

I'll lazy point [this thread instead digging examples. France, USA. Bill Gates saying Pfizer-type vaccines probably first choice richer countries afford them, whereas Oxford vaccine value poorer countries need cheaper solutions. That's funny, anonymous tough guy internet. remember going road trip Ohio Florida one spring break. way back up, two cars 10 people stopped gas station. Everyone promptly refused pay gas.. ‘someone eventually give pay everything, pitch anything’. 

If everyone paid 5 dollars, would way within 10 minutes.

Literally sat hour. paid gas car, drove fast fuck away there. Lucky car?

Every stop, found way get people pay share gas money back me. pissed “why dick?” 

I think story good way explain America. Wow, *are* impressive numbers. Thank sharing. Oh shit, legitimately thought r/politics . Boy feel dumb. It’s natural disasters handled well. agree locking places cases unnecessary. Especially mmmbop That’s truly feels. daily routine  ( “ trout”) down, worry even safe try find job, much less go back office stressful. see someone without mask, instantly become angry selfish fucking act I'd prefer fearmongering fat orange liar fucking day. elaborate bit this? vaccination license return normal? 

Hypothetically, flu vaccine chooses correct strain flu season, receive vaccine, still contagious? understanding. 

Or pneumonia, shingles, etc? I'm also one people wants improved public transportation people drive cars time Yes everyone's vote matter much swing states. stupid. saying people miss school make money? Thank you, hug 😊 Ignore troll, downvote move on. love says ""USA"" though would happen anywhere fuck else. Nothing store employees Yeah, it’s sad someone says something incredibly stupid like can’t tell they’re serious anymore. I’ll remember future. many committed violent crimes, aggravating factors that, like one? Small? Bruh people closed businesses lost jobs incomes. economic impacts affect virus actual vaccine proves dangerous?

The entire purpose Phase III trials answer question make 100% sure answer vaccine worse virus due pushed despite bad data?

The fact pause research upon slightest possibility dangerous give *more* confidence final product, less. Florida man strikes call Karen Europe? Every nightclub orange tint Gerrymandering however affect statewide legislation, indirectly cause voter suppression. AMERICA BAD! Like comment responded to, anti-maskers arguing right infect anyone ultimately, kill them. “acting” like idiots. Saw citgo thumbnail instantly thought going Boston. brain processed title, would've thought Florida. Fire sale coming neighborhood soon, particularly west coast. instead incompetent CDC, would incompetent FEMA.  another idiot right wing wacko thinks rights extend beating elderly. news article said victim asked space Rovester Ingram wearing mask social distancing. survival business. FYI, Semisonic got back together released new album year. Worldometer say bottom page:

“Since validation process takes time complete, additional cases expected added retroactively weekly historical dataset revision released Ministry Health Friday, Sept. 18”. 

I don’t know can’t use already available numbers though. What? 41 technically half truth?

At time, enough evidence available strongly vouch supposition masks suppressed spread, would say way let folks ""assume"" nothing sure? coped pain car accident twenty years ago decided want stop. really.

My grandmother passed years ago complications due advanced Alzheimer's disease. hospitals advanced care facilities latter years life.

While passing months afterward hurt, found lot solace knowing lived long, happy life free suffering.

My grandmother died timely manner.

The people died COVID... years decades ahead them. anyone ever asked ""what if"" get scowled neckbeard Besides Antarctica, places haven’t infected yet? Umm what? yeah, stay home. Living China lend credence surely? 
I mostly use Reddit read coronavirus stuff, see people talking shit China unfairly (there plenty fair shit talk; notice defend HK Xinjiang) makes sad want defend place live like genuinely think coronavirus response far excellent. I'm sorry upsets you, live information comes English language media reports countries generally politically opposed China, makes think information likely accurate mine? Let ask something hope answer honestly: son week live, would heartless tell stay home exit all? 

Or would good parent take anywhere wants go regardless impact actions might strangers even though instead one week live, ends living six days instead seven?

Be honest, please. Quality life matters quantity life: spending one extra day son never going better outcome pleasing son six days taking anywhere wants go. 

I hope understand difference. oh yeah, extra people died, numbers ""exceeded many times over"" India proud learn strategies bitter rival, Pakistan, deal covid. India chose nationwide lockdown 1.3 billion people, 600 cases covid, decided life lockdown 100,000 cases covid day. Actually, illness, around 4-5%, husband, around 8%. shit. gonna approach containment least Jan/Feb. 2021 never go outside house nothing bad ever happen you. don’t get people difficulty understanding this. think get hit dopamine attention rude, like millions addicts. incredibly destructive civilization. thanks honest reply. That's what's missing much everywhere. year's time anti-masker Karens pretending enthusiastic early adopters. someone tell Costco good ventilation 1000x this! No. I'm saying needs enjoy life (mY KiDs pArK) outweighs people's needs enjoy life.

If someone risk, virus wants enjoy life, shame spending last days/weeks/months Earth forever alone.

If want self-isolate risk want spend last days Earth hermit so. dictate others live life.   mean, like, kind of... dunno... authority figure... listened doctors scientists power follow advice contain disease outbreaks protecting population medical financial means cure vaccine found?

It sounds crazy - might crazy enough work! picture now: pilot lands plane full vaccines, they're quickly unloaded, pilot chucks molotov cabin sprints away explodes behind him. think know life expectancy works. make 80, mean going drop dead. average 80 year old 8 years left. know us lower life expectancy developed nations grandmother lives Iran, US. year left point (on average).

See us life expectancy tables: stories pathetic. numbers go time. 

The news negative trying scare us. difference story ""The US deadliest day since 3 days ago""! 

2 weeks! got kidding me! deadliest day since ghe pandemic began, would news relevant.

The scare tactics news uses pathetic. goodness thread let alone tbis story news. 

Btw, government smart, would buy every US citizen 6 month supply Vitamin D3 along Vitamin K2! would put pandemic end.

It changing seasons vitamin levels going going down, going get many many dumb stories like this. 

As vit levels go down, rhe deaths infections go up. 

Get vitamin people! smart! important ever supplement Vitamin D3. Yeah, clearly amateurs. many flights entering china right now? mean expat community abroad basically lower case ratios general Us population? 13 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday.

One suspected case found Yunnan today. Obviously 🤦‍♂️ famous Salem witch trials, Joe McCarthy hearings. fucking cool.

That really depends ask good friend family member dies it. TLDR: 10 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 70 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Serious question, problems solved would change it? Mm hmm yup 5.4 positivity rate pretty low, though, right? That's want too. eating out, outdoor restaurants wear masks food comes server leaves. one restaurant server would wear mask properly. paid drinks, order told manager leaving. ask first wear mask nice it, kept swinging table taking mask talk. also won’t eat place tables close. thought responsible rethinking stance. don’t anything else risky, work home wear masks everywhere. Job market looking better ever! won’t need another stimulus package. economy made recovery. Although many like Fauci predicted country would total chaos extra 600 unemployment. Well fine without that. Everything including stock market seems pretty great. I’m sure recession you’re referring treadmill either lol Like diabetes glaucoma? Im sure much cargo space Boeings 737s would opportune moment deliver goods getting aircrafts re-certified. Chicago don’t either, recently drove cabin Wisconsin practically masks sight might shock know life expectancy USA...is 78.54 years.

80 year old people USA already life expectancy. 

""But gran 101 alive"" Sure, there's kids die soon born. Outliers invalidate average. stupid people still refusing use masks risk minuscule instead infinitesimal. Uh. Given recent work fascists cops west coast, might *lot* longer so, far understand. think I’ve heard say face coverings better none, it’s end all.

His podcast excellent, helps stay focused main issues pandemic itself. CORONAVIRUS RESPECT 51% RULE! /s Yes do. point - that’s longer excuse.

No one ignorant fact masks help unless they’ve living cave. Aren’t large percentage population always financial trouble US ? think social media really made everyone dumber though didn’t know much virus then. Doctors learning new things everyday adjusting viewpoints should. think didn’t want people panic conserve ppe first responders. said, still good reason lie. point - that’s longer excuse. 

No one ignorant fact masks help unless they’ve living cave. It’ll still help. like Americans seem trust government anymore, tone message get leaders change lot. Yep that’s Dude get life.  pandemic likely go history straw broke camel’s back 40 years poor economic decisions. 

Prior pandemic Federal Reserve Board annual survey reported near 50% Americans didn’t think could afford $400 emergency. Thank you, right. Gonna make sure get flu shot soon. know much.

 Melatonin associated extended REM sleep vivid dreams. Case reports people nightmares bigger doses. evidence doses help night terrors though?

Too much literature wade through, much conclusive.

The dosing strange too, perhaps individualistic. Like larger doses greater effect take much effect yes, i'm willing risk harming people things, insane. DeSantis deserves things can't mention think misinterpreted data. Lowest death rate cases declining across country. Seems pretty normal me. guy trying hard scare us Americans. Sorry Fauci numbers prove wrong. COVID without vaccine prolonged shutdown like many predicted would needed. job done. may stop spreading Bs now. Also, pretty sure 20-30 year old teachers weren’t dropping dead flu like covid that’s me. Agreed Thank compassion. know lot negativity towards people weddings COVID subreddit. Many us planned weddings pandemic started (we booked November) experienced lots stress anxiety pandemic wedding wanting keep loved ones safe. gotten together friends since March, get groceries delivered, etc. idea getting married pandemic daunting definitely imagined started planning.

I know lot people sub saying postpone, unclear things back normal, venue booked solid Fri-Sun end 2021, 30s looking try start family soon getting married postponing 2022 really great option us either. trying stay positive marrying best friend family important. appreciate compassion rather vilifying us going really tough time. ""and REPUBLIC...for stands."" Never democracy agree lived bay area weeks ago even fires people ALWAYS wore masks usually wore properly. didn’t see anyone without one indoor space April went airport head college (must people town guess). Indoor dining never reopened county clear majority people wore masks even low-risk outdoor environments like walking dog hiking trails. people admitted though wore really health reasons, “FU Trump” thing didn’t want stigma person without one. 

The virus managed spread summer despite masking, maybe staying home part fires help. vaccine covid able get it. aware, always try wear mask feel unwell still need run errand, get groceries etc. You’re kind weird 
[http://www.princeton.edu/\~fujiwara/papers/excess\_deaths.pdf](http://www.princeton.edu/~fujiwara/papers/excess_deaths.pdf)   Dont worry it'll April. 


/S 

-_- It’s virus human contain. Going eat directly cause get virus. Cigarettes directly cause cancer. people honestly ridiculous lol 

And I’m north don’t call grandmother mee-maw, it’s pretty classist assume south insinuating grandma “mee-maw” see views ignorant therefor must stupid south. Check privilege, sug! hometown seemed think so, instituted 25 mph speed limit townwide. sure trying say here? children elderly parents willing risk ? won’t. minute chance speak of, sure large effect. reality is, stay like this, downward spiral try minimize can.  terminal condition mean allowed get people sick way out. cannot pick entire household bubble with. chosen bubble lives others, must home alone visit house.

What hell point this? seem particularly likely actually prevent spread. Bubbles households default... never able achieve 90% reduction contact people. That's fairytale isnt even worth trying. Happily divorced parents still involved children’s lives vs. unhappily married parents fight lot. one would pick? divorce isn’t end world. Children don’t always resent parents it. It’s like you’re thinking terms what’s shown movies. Real life far nuanced complex. didn’t go party. high school college. Screaming/personal space ignoring/drunk/intoxicated hookup events never appealing me.

Since party culture pervasive, finding school peers wouldn’t pressure “typical” stupid adolescent college things took work. Fortunately found quite friends similar opinions school.

Edit - y’all downvoting don’t like party neither friends? I’m curious sparked reaction. Half population countries condition makes high risk.

My husband autoimmune condition. neighbours assume we're low risk we're 40s? (They also assumed we're like 25, that's something else.) True. one help find anything store. looking pickled daikon radish pad thai. long wandering experience still know got right thing. Damn course Fauci right except think means mid-2022 real correlation though? cuz people catch COVID likely lot things, course would done basic thing eat restaurant. 

Doesn’t seem people really catching restaurants, since bars clubs frequent ways people catch it. aren’t really interacting strangers restaurants, bars, people close talking masks. got back bike ride though Manhattan....everyone us partying, distance packed together in: Humans really good solving massive challenges want takes one time higher risk location scenario contract spread it. Dayyyyum Er, think goes ""the definition insanity thing expecting different result."" I’ve seen movie.. end using sled dogs. Dam took back DMB show. old dude next friends ragged big ass joint. smiled passed us smoked took outer space. Good times. Now, Americans worried going dinner &amp; getting haircuts, might side things well.. 

But.. 

*Muuuhhh FreeDUMBS*

#🤦‍♀️🙄 I’m arguing shouldn’t fined. entity harms employees others fined realistic amount sway along covering costs harmed. Yes, it’s still natural selection, internet access. education substantially without paying it.

Stupidity choice entirety human knowledge pocket. ended urgent care something similar. thought maybe peptic ulcer. pain started late February spent month quietly freaking one paying attention this. actually not. ""storms"" different issue.

Furthermore, ADE number 1 thing looking vaccines. far, evidence observed it.

Even among observed reinfections (we less dozen confirmed, btw- anecdotal stories differentiate reinfection relapse), one severe case US, there's high chance may cleared 1st infection hit 2nd due timing. 2nd reinfection reported US elderly man compromised immune system prior covid. So, no, seen evidence ADE point.  children properly cared perhaps time put stop humanitarian crisis originates topple cartels &amp; governments allow happen first place. Uh, think also bartenders desire experience paycheck, too, bud. Good luck lockdown next summer, that's going sustainable. Poland? live italy covid hotspot people walk around like chin disease running around, everyone protecting chin nose mouth, wich probably stupid thing cause still disconfort mask without benefit. Also restaurants full nobody respect covid directions wich illegal nobody seem care. gonna another wild winter. unsafe higher risk bad outcomes.

you mean 90 year old people lying care home beds 15 years? think generally dont go much either way... Someone photoshop ""sponsored death"" small white letter bottom corner. fault (Spain). embarrassment Europe. left Germany returned USA student visa expired... it’s like another world here. Things normal-ish Germany it’s madness conspiracies here. wrong country? Yeah that's mentioned ohio. No. many people dying things, Covid positive.

Consider .. ""false positives"" real thing, right?

So even *not single real positive covid case* USA, would still wind certain amount positive cases every week. people hospital admissions, tested brought hospital reason. end dying, ""death Covid"" counted Covid deaths.

Point .. even real Covid, would still end new Covid cases new Covid deaths every week, testing system used *terrible* never supposed used detect Covid. member titanic? member! testing programme based technology exist yet. esteemed PM detail live spectacular announcements foundation reality points are:
- People get work will. apply scholarship work part time pay community college, expensive. Plus, community college probably closer home pay board.
- job pay needs bit cushion, need find better job. get better job learning new skills, getting certification, hustling. all. takes efforts drive completely doable. 
- People get advises asking looking online. successful person environment? Ask him/her advise. financial literacy advices online. Again, need take initiative.
- lot financial stress see caused poor life choices, e.g., overspending, many kids can't afford, addictions vices.

No one succeeds life getting handouts, matter generous are. People need take initiatives change things work out. US country offers opportunities. tragic people take advantage opportunities. good one compare infections? wish speedy recovery! It’s also federally illegal technically Whilst government voted laws break get absolutely nothing, even slightest remorse. justice that. NE vs Dolphins moment. Pro7MAXX announced game they're showing next. Wow, woulda thought! reasons

just agree with, understand, and/or benefit gradual total neoliberal takeover France, mean protesting stupid. topic that's reductionist view yellow vests. protests initially fuel taxes would hit many poor people hard, point able afford heat. class composition different Trump mob whatever Actually legal system based deciding whether apply laws, CPS decides whether press charges based several criteria.

And whether feel Cummings charged insulting effect case.

In case, deserve maximum fine would deserve it? India 56 deaths per million, UK 626.

India fine. course expect people throw party save lives. That's like bare minimum human decency - making small personal sacrifice much greater good. hard weigh party potentially causing death number people chatting instead people zoom keeping others safe. even deliberation- selfish someone think 'right party' comes rights others live. ...be Dublin answer almost every conspiracy theory hear. theory depends upon great number people cooperating cover something maintain total secrecy, pretty much guarantee implausible. Especially we're talking multiple countries colluding clear purpose--as case Covid-19. benefits one shut global economy cripple entire nations. would China, Russia, Iran, Colombia, US agree pretend there's deadly virus killing hundreds thousands people? would serve individual country? far winners pandemic...does really make sense forcing people wear masks? Even though fucks facial recognition technology governments spent past couple decades investing in?

It's amazing easy poke holes conspiracy theory. people cling intellectual capability logical reasoning skills understand idiotic sound. Increasing exposure linked increased Covid-19 transmission.

* Dining restaurants
* Going gym
* Sucking thumb getting groceries take days test positive. indoors outdoors visiting sister? Mask mask? indoors without mask, higher risk outdoors, mask, 6 feet social distance. 

Personally you, I'd self-quarantining right assuming exposed. certainly go work teacher-- would totally reckless. would going grocery store, even mask. Wait days get tested COVID assuming clear. working well (Australia, New Zealand).

Source? two countries mention also put place extensive mitigation measures sort favored epidemiologists - stay-at-home, masking, etc. Dont think r safe all. People practicing social distancing anything here. fatality rate looking at, infection rate. work make likely die covid get it, likely catch covid find people wearing mask they're driving absolutely one else car windows rolled even mildly entertaining. Oh god I’ve read least one those. mom believed shit read everything came house. Completely, utterly batshit crazy. also fond supermarket tabloid front page photos current president (every president) shaking hands space alien. Stupidity new invention. Oh god absolutely surrounded death ones watching high quality? It’s German public radio station interviewing virologists. translated English. think you’re right statements masks weren’t clear been. think said something like, “Cloth masks almost certainly reduce risk Covid, don’t studies saying much risk reduced. wear masks, don’t use masks measure safety help it.” announced far advance? get giving little bit notice surely Almost week gonna result people taking extra risks? 

Either way hope works all. lot friends Tel Aviv many already lost jobs financially ruined. Hopefully lockdown strong response result job creation things get back track sooner...keep safe Thank goodness can't fine people USA 1A. right gather trumps public health.  even cases transmitted universities, kids brought them. schools stay open, going rapidly get control. I’d wager risk level comparable doctor working covid unit. don’t N95 need get one, also need face shield kid coughs face contract eyes.

So, so, many teachers students going die. Nowhere world managed pull plan off. Nowhere. guess except countries like New Zealand, infection rates already catastrophic. Serbia peak summer back lower 2005, UN made declaration declare ""Food"" human rights. country vote no: US Israel. something similar niece high school. 

She trying decide teacher nurse career. told teacher would never respected make sufficient income thrive, nurse would get respect, paid well, portable career would let work anywhere. 

She's Creighton University third year Bachelor Science Nursing program. Since many police quitting probably worry budget. choice working parents definitely work fired and, yet, many creative options exist younger children. far best option seems work home homeschool, assumes parent able work home able actually *do* job children around without getting fired, true lot. Believe me, we'd love options risking exposure complete poverty. Best luck this. go teaching Science. schools I’ve taught allowed kind instruction limited maybe 1-2 times. Doesn’t matter kids learn much enjoy it... don’t pass state mandated tests won’t teaching long.

I seriously hope able achieve dream. yet almost countries done continue it. Seems working well (Australia, New Zealand). Obviously pros cons everything. sage advice W.H.O offered us historic pandemic? can't stop bother trying? Wear mask? Death is, course, matters. However, topic posted article deaths, commented deaths.

I saddened 200,000 deaths, outraged Mother Nature allowed virus jump animals humans, killed *mostly* people year two death old age? get mad Mother Nature? also gave us beautiful planet fucking up.

Governments (acting behalf fear-mongering people like you) enacted policies kill (over next years) number people COVID killed. outrage, since policy-driven deaths preventable deaths young people full lifetime ahead them. Blue lives matter unless it’s hoax disease! Nani??? chillest dudes. hottest outbreaks. expected starting late October. school fully remote first quarter, students attend in-person learning certain subjects remote learning subjects starting second quarter. SO's subject remote, students always attend classes online, required work empty classroom. No, hospital system US anywhere near overwhelmed NY exception part Cuomo’s horrible decision regarding nursing homes. However, stated endlessly, cases spreading “rampantly”. see you‘re willing change last description suit argument. \*Now\* you’re stating virus \*has not\* spread rampant reason decent recovery rate. Everywhere else, argument spread far control.

I made mention mutations. would compassionate rest humanity. Sounds fascist though...  feel like taking even somewhat seriously fall common sense category. workers prob contract work work close proximity one another. add fact many industries employ ethnic minorities, live multi-generational homes others also work low-paying ""essential"" industries high-risk contracting virus. yeah, message loud clear elementary week-long outdoor Ed. field trip, overnight loggings cabin, took place boonies. right passage highly anticipated. India fared extremely well given large population, likely due much younger population. can't even agree FUCKING COUNT SHIT. Something noticed people grow internet seem BS filter it. pet theory boomers grew believing people tv said true adjusted new normal internet box lie you.  pictures descriptions story heartbreaking:

There still large number people wearing masks. seems mostly younger generation think infecteded. Power you, always felt like learned jack outdoor educational situations. Well, rise cases US BLM started. sit watch idiots. They're ones screaming high-school/college football re-opened. one thing like Facebook we'll public record people stupid 25 years now.

I always used wonder Germans lived towns concentration camps located could pretend happening go lives. global pandemic really opened eyes willingly people suspend disbelief obvious, want deal it.

Truly frightening stuff. Well there's fuckin surprise!  6G coming soon! Lol another parroting sheep see Ah see. Thanks sharing. many ppl even care sum up, know fuck talking about. correct? Prepare emotionally school going lose many teachers, students, support staff plan. It’s guaranteed. safe way proposed here. hasn’t achieved anywhere world yet school thinks somehow species exception? didn’t even adapt older kids taught? can’t believe stupid plan is, it’s disappointing. much needless death.

I’m sorry harsh people need fucking wake call. one special, one exception, yet somehow see stupid patterns replicated face overwhelming, blatantly obvious evidence. cases doublin' I'm oppressed! ^/s good. think learned lesson? Except talked European country, is. like end march numbers far ""nobody really dying anymore.""

You accept *some* cases *some* deaths. 

Just like Pneumonia. *could* totally stop society try reduce pneumonia cases deaths zero ... dont. would ""too much"". live Pneumonia, pneumonia deaths every week.

We way Covid. goal NEVER ""eliminate Covid"". ""flatten curve"" hospitals overwhelmed. Remember that? done flying much money people making lying goverment social networks.

Believe me, would LOVE get paid considering Covid made entire family unemployed, although none us know single case. Na, blame everything EU Notice said ""leadership"" order. Obviously many governors follow CDC guidelines reopening, fact encouraged Trump's statements. Several even said would close Trump asked to, notably [florida's governor rather explicit current situation US wholly avoidable, shown US uniquely worse relative rest developed world. 

That said, certainly ways federal government incentivize states comply federal guidance. course things federal government could better managed itself, like testing, supply chains, rules transport, etc, etc. Quarantine 14 days trip. Yep. PTA member asked wife choice homeschool registered quipped, "" well...best luck."" something along lines.

**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Makes sense Assuming everyone would wear entire time Seriously. bludgeon everyone hot take religion LMAO. probably responding teenaged kid I’m sick getting “they’re dying things” spiel. people understand co-morbidities?  family diabetes heart disease? understand many governments failed react even PPE producers approached virus came country holding back PPE healthcare workers. stockpile issues too. paint government trying best seems disingenuous. 

They fucked stockpile, fucked early warning gave actively harmful advice people order cover fuck ups. could done lot better. zombies December?! Chinese well Hong Kong doctors told us start lying time, right? lost debate saying one deadliest pathogens. believe it, dollar every time hear ""they blew nothing"" yeah, flu arguments still lives on, fabricated everything--deaths, diagnoses, medical articles... least country, middle March everyone sent home, beginning April everyone said wear mask, middle April said masks would mandatory going shops transport, end April made so. Technically speaking, lost month half, time also told using masks would help despite initial wrong advice.   
   
People wear masks simply stupid comfort, egoism stupidity. mistake made, let show to.not handle things, carte blanche everyone ignore brains. killed researcher _Contagion_. recommend staying hotel middle pandemic. Honestly life seems pretty normal live, aside thw minor adjustments everywhere reduce spreading. really normal people seem like they've adapted part... things still open running bars opened yesterday. Yes, rare point. doesn’t find reservoir might toast. mean 1 25 didn’t recovered/died?  hate shit, too. I’m introvert, gotta understand, following guidelines keep ass safe others, too. don’t know many people backing comment. shit sucks, humanity deal way worse diseases like smallpox, before. Maybe US. beginning also said wear masks change public stance quicker US. populace made masks live. done right first time completely shutdown for, say 3 months, on-and-off-and-on-again lockdown cycle. 

Yeah, jobs would lost complete shutdown, least could started recovering May/June ... half-measures meant places able open 7 months end sight. much worse could been. North East England pretty much everyone wearing mask indoors. I've Wales English border region (Shropshire) Wales 10 days, mask wearing noticeably fewer incidence there.

Yet, North East we're seeing outbreaks four local authorities looking likely candidates placed local lock down, Shropshire, mask wearing nowhere near high seeing outbreaks.

I think indicates always suspected: virus passed around places indoors masks worn crucially people enclosed spaces prolonged periods time sharing recirculated air, places pubs homes. People packing town city centre pubs guidelines ignored taking virus home families. early call good news.

If recall, situation US early summer—cases rising fast, deaths falling. contradiction, make much sense, people saw called panic media hype.

Fast forward late summer—the death surge came huge. Deaths lagging indicator, that's all. Europe see surge soon. Well big surprise. read virus mutations? Also makes think chances death people recovering virus mutating? 

If people “recovered” C19 it’s probably lock downs preventive measures taken, lowering number people get disease + rapid development treatment C19. Affect Effect.
""The virus might affect you..... "" masks gone mid January. Important keep mind death rate also changing due many variables. 

Doctors gotten better treating covid patients, progress therapeutics aid treatment well.

Also demographics infected changing. Lots outbreaks early nursing homes example largely younger people getting infected. 

It many years concrete idea even always large margin error. Weird, ears burning thinking week whether could ""vaccinate"" small, ever increasing ""doses"" real diseases, covid.

I never even considered masks almost already.

""Bye honey, I'm work, yes, already took morning whiff anthrax, sound like mother!""

No idea whether build immunity anthrax probably candidate Morning Whiff^TM (as patenting it) anyways various *reasons* get idea. wear mask may happy vaccident. incorrect, see comment numbers. wouldn’t trust Coronavirus news outlets like economist. [that navy also; remember thinking odd many young people symptoms unless enclosed space increasing initial viral load. hear? reddit AMERICA bad. \s  SARS multi-year immunity. already rare cases reinfection months SARS-Cov-2. would want one based one good you! Ended negative!  🤣🤣🤣🤣 also mask gives higher income , better sexlife faster car. Research suggests dance around underwear *irony off* course don't. surprised? lot media outlets locked behind paywalls large number people creating threads lazy simple cut paste job. goons commenting nothing inane headline. headline like news headlines tells completely different story found actual articles.

The ones hide behind paywalls usually want switch adblocker off. Take pc slows snail's pace due ads appear, folk soon get wise instead read headline again. There's actually many sites half decent masses read. BBC etc fine ad free paywall free. 

As someone resides thew UK, find US media outlets worst paywalls spamming ads never bother. friends Sweden seems like guys concern lives fellow Swedes see U.S., probably big part difference results. Jokes you, dysfunctional attachment system prove literally this. complete rubbish. certain political party would know paid attention anything written past 500 years disease.

They know. care. create reality use propaganda get followers believe it. opinion Carlos Fix title go grave understand he/his campaign failed swing proverbial meatball. 

It right there. could sailed reelection. didn't. 

Now, I'm complaining. never understand. turns masks made along way real vaccine clickbaity text.

In 2-3 years headlines be: ""Unemployed dad makes $ 386,000 day giving potential immunity Covid-19"" That's US. Europe, Asia, etc. number grows dramatically. COVID far know however.

GO HOSPITAL. 

It better safe sorry. wearing mask acts like fucking placebo cure like homeopathy? guideline: can't distance, wear mask. People want mandate tho make required... Confidentiality rules like female patient got transverse myelitis? patient sex/age range disease made public need personal information beside disassociated trial.

The confidentiality rules thinking condition clearly going end one papers team publish later now.   imagine expenses wedding, don’t think it’s smart. Pandemics last long time. shortly after.

Like 2 months after. What? news outlets? That's literally taxes medicare extra steps. get cultural thing... but, jeez. person wear hats reason confirm. 1980s time capsule known Mississippi masks, objective reality general, slow catch on. Thankfully state issued mask mandate long felt normal. way hell I’d take vaccine dude.

Always kind wonder people keep circlejerking this.

Are form Africa around Pakistan? American there's chance beloved Trump would allow take Chinese vaccine even one working. literally stealing CITIZENS. matter ""hoarding"" them, private property. Never forget this. Could Might. That's strong science junior. Sorry man alot death despair-we need get thru somehow set smart expectations. going away month -stupidity. get thru better govt helps us dad peacefully passed 11th morning :( thank prayers dad passed morning 11th :( mean did, thats happened. Even lies. Imagine would people started facial coverings bandannas February. 400k dead Americans ""lets face territory you"" kind inevitability? number probably end year. 

I guess human life means little shrug lied public health experts. I’m irritated jingoism I’ve thought could used theme advantage.

Invoke Kennedy’s line something it’s easy it’s hard. Say China lockdowns Americans surely endure hard weeks. Reference sacrifices made WWII, point much better it, organize distribution emergency supplies.

He could beaten nationalistic drum gotten everyone aligned beginning.

I used roll eyes Obama’s “community organizer” credentials could really used set skills year.  Remember Dr.Fauci told public there's reason wearing mask? 

Fucking batshit insane. people keep thinking it’s hoax parties, discouraging mask usage/proper hygiene (honestly like damn wash hands) taking seriously it’s going keep extending itself. jerk family like... well maybe prayer work? I.e. abusive husbands, dads, etc... 'MURICA fat cat CEOs **big mask** aren’t satisfied Halloween anymore. 



They concocted whole “pandemic” bullshit along Netflix, Uber Eats, Zoom Pornhub. I’m sorry lost brother this.  Ur logic wrong assumes vaccine 100% efficiency life Well states would act right wouldn’t add months sub joke. People really seem realize big 1% multiplied amount people hospitalized. that’s am. Millennial never quite fit. meant temp checks shifts, one bothers, one day sought check, digital thermometer broken anyway, replaced either. Masks also mandatory work one ahole thinks apply managers care, co workers don't, I've gotta blow prick want catch it. Guess IAITA. Yeah Irish person, Europe making mistakes well. 

We stay locked longer got virus control. I'm seeing problems US having. Virus fatigue people giving social distancing. 

Was bus day everyone put masks getting on, law, half took sat down. 

Cases last weeks Europe close US numbers again, nothing brag about. better Spring getting control low numbers summer, people relaxing much coming Autumn. I've never noticed nightmares specifically, definitely vivid dreams taking melatonin. Ok, thank you. Information collected fast collected. really anyway getting around that.

In addition, really elected officials, scientists, weigh risks using info provided authorize approach. France going wall. know plan except lockdown killed many jobs want avoid one, understand time badly handled. 

They count people behaving protect others except many people care others ""one person sick one person dead"". 

People like throw tantrums whine, think government like ""ok, want play dumb, we'll follow, want wear mask? M'kay, don't, remember fault. go work send kid school, we're nice guys want money""  Germany discussion. bat shit crazies, become ridiculous political question like here. People seriously downvoting this? Lmao. seems temperature checks new mask.


These stories people false sense security, temp checks working.


Everyone grandma said years, fever, stay home. Even Covid-19. aslo know fools ignore advice, half office class wondering person showed put others risk.


But sudden, technology wait several minutes tongue thermometer, sending people home fever wrong?


Yes asymtomatic people. That's need continue socially distance, disenfect stuff, wash sanitize hands, wear mask.


But mean give symptomatic people pass.



If Covid-19 going around, everyone would complaining idiot fever going public, work, school, etc... spreading whatever had. Please voluntarily reduce movement tragic loss health would force government step in. It’s schools. ah antimaskers safe told before, known myth maybe gotten sick Putin daughter innoculated. even symptoms mild ones virus give heard problems ograns. heard young boy mild symptoms weeks infection died organic failure. know less say something good/save deceptive.

Exposure small amounts Coronavirus virons lead immune response without symptomatic COVID-19 infection. immune response may cause development immunity viruses trigger immune responce do. leads lower chance infection rechallenge.

Covid special regard. theorised happens happens almost every URI, first data back up. quoting article which, right, seem match graph. Viruses spread even relatively harmless viruses young high IFR care home. point we're treating virus differently (especially blaming people spread it) whereas respiratory infections (either bacterial viral) relatively common cause death elderly. already accept price civil liberties, social life economy etc. certain number people die infectious diseases year. 

And, I'm sorry wrong vaccination. Nothing add that.  Actually... Since live country free healthcare taxes go paying everyone healthcare probably won't. basically everyone suffering long term basically die street go bankrupt. Well really want avoid another lockdown, they're going planning. smart. We're screwed United States. exception northeast west, we're really extensive planning fall winter epidemic. least none see. I'm obviously CDC employee. $29,000 fine sure ought teach company billions revenue take measures necessary protect employees. penalties like far easier pay fines replace employees get sick. Masks beneficial also shouldn’t attribute benefits don’t have. Remember opinion piece, something that’s observed, tested, proven different sources. That’s important. don’t want lure people false sense security, otherwise people gathering en masse believing it’s okay everyone’s wearing masks. saw happened lockdown. announced warning deliberately, giving people time make arrangements. hear, migrant workers excluded food aid arrangements lockdown. saw videos people streets literally beaten compliance. Tough love indeed. Really hint at, opportunity government flex muscles guide plausible deniability good cause. Sad.  source indicates India still trading Iran US refuse give permission? 

And EU, INSTEX joke. mechanism exists, European companies afraid American government threats make use it. Simply put, European companies believe governments capable protecting Americans. 

The country actually continued trade Iran China. cannot, virus even exist one year.

Your Google research better deniers ""researching"". times billion equals planet fucked prefer homeschool, think. ever go actual school. But, work education seem like would enjoyed school. talking, get trouble smallest thing (like bouncing legs something), plus held back classmates behind. Ugh. 

I able learn way. reading Shakespeare 8, instead ... basal readers saying Pat cat, would found incredibly boring. 

My mom let us get adult books library card, reading far grade level early (by 9 so, found kids books boring). able use full set encyclopedias dictionary look words didnt know. mom also got us subscription history book collection, one ancient civilization per month came door read Aztecs, Incas, Mayan, Egypt etc. 

The subject suffered math, since one family good it. get private tutor. 

For field trips road trips family historic locations around state. 15, spent 6 months England learning another culture / country staying friend (and since home schooled, interfere schooling). 

Socially, lot. But, also actually want to. major introvert grandmother tried make us pool parties and.. found tiring / annoying. still find social events tiring annoying. much happier home dogs book, Netflix. Lol avoided parties college well. 

Though, fortunate mom invested time learning. worked full time (12 hour shifts factory) spent time reading us such. But, forced learn school way.. doubt would found reading much fun. resisted first. started loving written word allowed explore free access local library, including adult sections. Moby Dick, Little Women, Call Wild, Edgar Allan Poe. got read 8-12 years old, mom let check card. students school access these. get Dora Bob Builder kids titles. would incredibly bored. initially made want anything library, books kids section card given let check those. poor mom got one book herself, allowed 3 per card let brother get one hers. library let us bigger books ours, even mom asking it!

We hardly used text books provided us schooling. education much more.... natural. dog actually ate text books one year. hilarious ""dog ate homework"" excuse stereotyped. graduate bachelors education next year. much Montessori style anything else. IDIOTS.  


Idiots EVERYWHERE.

jfc Ah, good hear. restating written article headline looked bit focused 'US tourist' part. far sources go, Süddeutsche usually pretty good reliable though. Glad see confirmed :) Endothelial actually. Yes we’re seeing heart, deterioration endothelium happening blood vessels; it’s lungs, smallest vessels, hit first. It’s lose sense smell tiny blood vessels nose get swollen shut. It’s covid toes thing. attacks Agreed live Como mask ordinance. People get office immediately try take mask like...no bro gotta wear inside, too. Protests don’t spread covid, Walmart lowes prank bro Or, know big one, US population weren’t made majority redneck / dumbasses, wouldn’t hard all. 

These people going convince climate change real even though it’s probably late. Sigh. touches penis. I'm worried touched soul touched penis. step siblings something now? Plus chairs right next other. Wherever testing backlog like this, community spread pervasive. 

Good luck, UK 🍀. See nobody takes sub seriously. obvious going beginning. us enjoy hanging friends things even means paying premium go nice restaraunt. don’t wanna cliche stay inside eating hot pockets alone forever.  There's also fact ripped lot vulnerable people once. Theres survivor bias happens. 

Ex. health care workers going die died. ones didnt ones continue work said vulnerable population. 

The spread early days vast. agree, think mild second wave overall. NE hit hard whole. Europe certain regions hit hard, spreading areas much.

Like Northern Italy seeing huge surge, spreading around rest country spread controlled. Spain first wave hit Madrid hard. spreading around rest country (although Madrid medium share cases iirc) . I'm guessing gonna vary everyone high majority feel life long symptoms that's insane think imagine getting virus 25 50 years later still feeling effects? Nah might feel couple times Every months lifelong? Absolutely going sound like dumb question, level inflammation similar common cold vs covid? write resumes living. I’ve worked many teachers wanted start new career nobody cares teachers. John Adams miniseries showed (video sorry hear may find peace know 1st hand, something get ""through"" never ""over"".

What's telling post *Boston Magazine* article controversy surrounding forbidden theory mod ""certified virologist"" subject magazine article PhD genetic researcher.

Makes  got complimented mask exactly twice. Star Wars mask tie fighters material laying around time. got complimented marijuana dispensary, people usually pretty nice one another, dude Gamestop. I'm pretty sure two main social interactions 3 months there. novel strain coronavirus, coronaviruses new. Believing SARS Cov 2 utterly unlike coronaviruses irrational. don’t believe new flu strain, believe less severe, less infectious, strains still flu virus behave like one. remember covid starting, said use masks help prevent spread covid.  Austria Europe, Australia Oceania. Individuals supposed symbiotic relationship larger economy, Covid laid bare truth serve particular economic system much serves us. mention narrative we’ve long fed market economies organically innovating adapting faced churn adversity apparently mostly bullshit. There’s six months incredibly strong demand innovations PPE, testing, contract tracing, improved indoor air handling, better remote working/learning solutions, etc. shelves still mostly empty. Something clearly seriously broken US economy apparently captains industry don’t know fix it, assuming even care first place. sad read. think would enough business without restrictions/lockdowns? pisses (doubt I'm alone this) seems obviously expected vulnerable people country (ones need money, desperate situations can't refuse little work/money get) line fill dangerous jobs, they're expected risk lives twice (risk lives take job, risk lives do). bass sound heard collective groan restaurant industry. Everyone blasts cum, dude. Virginity prerequisite knowledge. Sorry burst bubble you. like that, though. people need hospitalizations long-term care. never work lung damage organ damage. think pays disability? do. Exactly. abundant displays store matter much home. small amount available asshole move buy need it. lets forget impossible innocent people get convicted. Imagine going jail something used test subject medical experiments. Calculating death rate based confirmed cases stupid. actual death rate way lower. Heres cdc IFR broken age group

0-19 years: 0.00002

20-49 years: 0.00007

50-69 years: 0.0025

70+ years: 0.028

The discrepancy sweeden numbers US numbers CFR largely due difference testing had. US testing globally, CFR lower Sweedens even IFR. please stop sensationalizing anecdotal events? adult who’s influence hormones highly susceptible social pressures, there’s room sympathy certain consideration condemning action. France test anywhere near amount US does. 10k cases France reeallllly bad. I've looked apparently massive disputes actual IFR covid (though seem go steeply age) age group. also doubt Covid deaths recorded compared flu. Look graphic half way page.

Rarely fatal bit fatal cause lifelong issues, mention spreading virus others.

Provoking immune response mean works like natural infection. Hunker Canada. Don’t go anywhere vaccine distributed everyone. don’t take mask off. Least homes! large proportion cases spread. think safest. Unless live alone course. don’t, consider getting place.

And vaccine come, make sure keep taking precautions. aren’t likely 100 percent effective. zero tolerance spread disease. Yes, handling like functioning democracy actually provides citizens would great.

We America though. ""Fuck you, suck dick, got mine, I'm goddamn cowboy."" Shouldnt post opinion peices like fact. No, need let dumb states go way. something joke about. Name another occupation complained much teachers job. Sanitation workers wade COVID infested human feces day complain less. Tough times come teachers say we’re essential, meanwhile consuming products previously created shipped magic. Many people really want Black Death. It’s become thrilling think Covid end times plague rather something akin flu ‘57. really believe people scared mind fucked covid, think there’s way pandemic could happen today’s world. bubble popped, coping mechanism , pretend it’s real, don’t complete nervous brake down. people weak minded people! work healthcare opinion direct impact work performance, nothing work.

Actually does, they're unnecessarily exposing everyone else work. people may immuno-compromized immuno-compromized family members home, meaning could literally kill someone. keep reveling selfishness guess. There's something called stages grief. Coronavirus challenge mankind, lot people stuck denial and/or wanting blame problem someone debate rather admit real situation. people focus lockdown policies government, slowly admit also hate people fear virus voluntarily choose stay home rather socialize patronize businesses. real issue virus, wanting deny problem, lockdowns policy.

SARS-2 per Nature magazine's review science, seems downregulate adaptive immunity. innate immunity, possibly memory (adaptive) features cellular (T-cell) immunity helping people. Also, BIG BIG indications is, respiratory coronavirus, hugely seasonally sensitive virus. reason disappeared summer? bad. much worse winter. We'll see happens, lots reason think bad.

Some coronaviruses short lived adaptive immunity. still know widespread reinfection possibility is. idea herd immunity saving us might folly. Also, places - including Sweden - there's sign herd immunity reached. socially distanced society R value must low could near eradication. But, without comprehensive testing policy, someone somewhere carry infection forward things get bad winter, Sweden see cases. socially distanced society, herd immunity, produced good results there.

Just look covid trackers online. number cases dropped 70,000+ cases day around 40,000+ cases day. disagree fewer cases before? U.S. averaging thousand COVID-19 deaths day. people die COVID-19 week died 9/11 attacks.

Sorry.  Dr. Fauci predict US? death rate varies country age. state requesting volunteers help count mail ballots election. We're swing state, first year mail ballots allowed. want volunteer, indoors volunteers whole time. state requires masks, state sanctioned event I'm assuming everyone wear mask. 

I'm low risk, super careful we're basically still self isolated.

But hey, let's open K-12 everything fine know means. job guy working 3rd shift came covid. Everyone came room got covid except me. wore masks, don't. constantly use hand sanitizer. hands go bathroom. 
Amazing fast people caught it, everyone even amazed catch it. either rampant surge meat prices. People understand co-morbidities. Guess it’s time wear mask rest history eagerly await anti-maskers spin Look! right! Masks cause breathing issues, even admitted it! wear ear muffs Another key point isn’t touched much thread people initially wearing masks self-protective measure, prevent spreading virus themselves. 

To point, early messaging pretty consistent know now, caveats. idea (fabric) mask won’t stop getting virus non-masked person mostly still rings true today.

The change happened concept shifted using masks self-protective measure, self-containing measure. seriously need get spare thought people actually deal starvation, civil war, death camps, etc. rabid environmentalists shut common sense forestry management, California fires rare, controlled. 

Selective logging, cutting firebreaks, controlled burns underbrush used prevent massive forest fires burn trees ground. 

This worked 1800's 1980's stopped ""to save spotted owl"".

The spotted owl turned bad science, owls everywhere even suburban backyards. 

50 years mismanagement caused fires.

The State warned repeatedly National forestry experts would happen change policy.

But politics trump science land fruit &amp; nuts.

This result.

And guess what? massive control forest fire kills spotted owls cutting fire breaks, controlled burns. American, also enjoy bashing idiocy often showcased Americans. Nonetheless, Americans idiots.

[Party Hamm, \- Use google translate many examples.

My point every country individuals appear give shit share society. blame Americans. Blame people. get works (great explanation BTW!), inoculate people small amounts virus? tell America. Good. Stay are. get close us please! think said “sick” winning 😳 cargo ships exist 2020 either?  Hey. peppermint peeps great s'mores. always thought funny watching puff microwave. People talking you? remember people actively avoiding shoppers, even making eye contact. may slightly better now. Wow left completely politicized term ""herd immunity "". isnt masks folks, enough people getting virus, beating it, moving reason taking 3 weeks work politicians refusing give sick pay. total non-issue countries welfare.

I appreciate seeing people masks makes feel better. However, feelings stop less efficient social distancing. sick seeing all. STONKS! asshole, right? /s think virus ""could gone week"" frankly, stupid allowed unsupervised. Look New Zealand Australia.

Most likely, virus NEVER going gone. point, we're going 5o 5o accept get back actually living.

Might easy I'm saying wearing mask uncivilized, I'm saying unnecessary civilized society. reason need people refusing (or given option) socially distance appropriately.

If need food medication: order online. exactly brother would said — priest (rip)

some comments awesome / thank 

and thanks wearing mask makes sense vid game Lost grandpa recently Covid, funeral costs going put debt that's American way days. part lost translation; note says ""restaurants must close 10 - also applies restaurants"" 

The second term ""Gastronomiebetriebe"", basically everything: bars, clubs, cafés, sandwich shops, ice cream parlors, watering holes, beer gardens, etc. anti mask nonsense.

It done intent purpose FATTENING curve.

They trying optimize pandemic economy, lives. result 200k Americans died unnecesary deaths, virus remains economy still danger.

It depends decisions make today coronavirus takes 200k american stop wrecking families.

For JUSTICE must served. lied mislead become rich beyond measure need pay crimes. still wearing mask 😎 Could fooled me, everyone neighbors media politicians acting like normal.

The people know lost dang jobs. FFS, right? 🤦🏻‍♂️😷 Well that’s case, praised Gods wearing pants! Nicotine harmless smoking isn't. crazy part stance Hollywood taking. certainly whole side progressive politics yet new movies waiting Covid make point trailers say ""Only theaters"" bold lettering make point. Seems go ideology. actual fuck. That’s messed up! know right?! deadly, *respiratory illness,* global pandemic boot! 99% world burning right now. fault decided live region like *three* different natural disasters happen regularly.   Ha yes, guess meant parent comment!  Around april,may,my mother made like 10 masks think,but wasnt didnt had,because medical masks expensive single use Spain actually decreasing daily new infections. People like misuse way data represented create headlines. Things control. agree, people scum everywhere. sad. wearing masks throwing everywhere...
it's mistake smt nationality. upbringing. family.
however, also social status country runs schools programs help people become better responsible human beings.

Unfortunately, programs inadequate countries world.

so, even though I'm ofter prone say damrn americans, actually darn EVERYONE.

there, said it.

how making subredit discuss make world better place?   Check profile, fake post. IKR?! I’m flabbergasted people believe shit. topic hand. name nice Germans. want that? make us even steven? Lmao wrong Irish Times? They're left-leaning reputable come. Regardless, opinion senior HSE doctor, article published frankly irrelevant.

I guess can't handle dissenting opinion dismiss it. Get real. Start looking facts. Thanks God Reddit [represent Couldn’t told people make homemade masks beginning? can’t believe stupid people charge are. 

I think message clear beginning Factory made masks health care workers homemade everyone else. games/no politics could united country fight this. sad. Said guy living america knew masks could help pandemic all. testing way better. way numbers presented confusing. 12k positives today period 7 days. need allocate first. right downward slope. Please. added discussion trolling name calling get want? 

I'm sure really fun person talk IRL... (/s case get one). Damn, thought baby boom refused sign new lease landlord ex still lives here, although moving month. fucking way would live like that. numbers correct. Wait Friday see true allocation day week. Numbers decreasing peak 1 week ago. Even peer-reviewed studies use term ""suggest."" whole *researchers prove!* phrasing almost always pop science pieces opposed journal articles. 

I disputing point, certainly ""strong enough"" suggestion cases vast majority cases outcome predicted. get annoyed whenever read ""study shows...!"" sad less tattoo shops also means less spread EXPONENTIAL VIRUS lives saved!! Damn that's feel happening around. Im finding conspiracy nuts anti listening anything. hand understand people confused. much information coming anti mask shit blends new information. overwhelmed stuff like tend cling something familiar something comprehend easily. annoying best keep flooding social media encouragement wearing mask. Would nice large social media companies lend helping hand this.....  Gee would nice sort test everyone could get see immunity. quoting New England Journal Medicine. bet would trust bad news though right? app built: 
DP-3T Design protocol: understand comic: hardly any. Test way better. friend symptoms super mild. year would considered another flu. able get tested. April case. way hospital get tested.

Also lots asymptotic people getting tested commentary, published New England Journal Medicine, advances unproven promising theory universal face mask wearing might helping reduce severity virus ensuring greater proportion new infections asymptomatic. 

It's still unproven people take gospel.  fair criticism, sensible reason. China shutting world wide mask production going satisfy demand everyone started buy them, thus better sell mask Chinese hope could contain (too bad already left China November) keep stockpile Healthcare professionals would exposed cases came China... shame many governments self sabotaged seriously checking incoming citizens sign virus least asking behave infected (IE wear mask), instead forbidding Chinese nationals calling day. priveledged

Check privilege.

One two wipes none stuck toilet 30 minutes crap. optimistic. US seriously suffering many ways pandemic revealing ugly inequalities. problem priveledged could afford travel: arrogant, ignorant American wanted party. far common Americans. I've suddenly become artistic past months?! common sense common.

Unfortunately, lack common sense also tend distrust scientists. clearly didnt, governments followed guidelines. everybody forgotten shitshow beggining this??? ""you need masks infected"" c. early 2020 May pubs, restaurants, etc nationwide curfews on. Pictures last night joke people acting. Limiting socialising 6 still means there's going hundreds thousands groups six coming contact others unintentionally, makes little sense. Nope lol they'll upvote literal opinion piece scream checkmate. I'm 100% masks holy heck, happened difference one person's opinion scientific research. 

That's bad certain person stating inject cleaning chemicals. Sure opinion ZERO scientific backing. Yet evidence Hydroxycholique might good form treatment. Christian, I've often frustrated American Christianity displayed (prisoner immigrant welfare, glorification war, aligning political parties expediency) , never extent COVID shown. never embarrassed Christ, often there's huge discrepancy two. 


There huge persecution complex within American Christianity, despite living one least persecuted times human history. Christ tells us expect persecuted, rejoice behalf him. I'm seriously concerned behavior ""Christians"" pandemic actually going lead real persecution, know I'm ready that. Basic immunology and, know, pandemics experienced pretty recent recorded history make bit certain proposition. 

Obviously isn’t typical study, well established biological study (and intuition) suggest bit known understood suggesting. 

This pandemic different sense known disease. There’s reason assume requires extensive testing prove otherwise. seen ppl without masks environments. luckily restaurants plenty outdoor seating. testing way better now. way control first wave. *Guardian* Wen flu season starts. Yy. saw happened toilet paper right? took 9 days come that? That's doing? Let guess, scrubs expert. feel sorry you. really do. stated observable truth.

China's economy recovering exactly quickly saved people.

I said Americans keep downvoting me:

Your people economy. can't economy people die sick mass scale.

Save people, save economy, business restart.

200k dead 6 million known infected end sight definition ""no fucks given"". Ensuring new infections asymptomatic can't possibly good thing though right?  mean guess that’s easier believe actual virus, like viruses dealt since beginning humanity. Maybe Black Plague conspiracy too! polio small pox influenza, 1918. It’s confusing. think viruses just...not thing? so, think that?

Occum’s Razor, people. Sometimes it’s easiest obvious answer. necessarily stupid people, people reason WANT believe hoax use intelligence create argue conspiracy theories support predetermined conclusion. government secret stash Electronium hats now? would know sticks life. Donavan Mitchell Nikola Jokic virus Mitchell played ass first round Jokic still balling. might say guys pro athletes.

Given substitutes often retired teachers... can't see going well. 

If anything, many districts shown callous indifference teachers' unions. going area? nobody gives shit anymore......

i think could 5,000 deaths day people wouldn't. care. wtf happened us? see downvotes upset led sheep . Thinking researching absurd me. Concept lovely, conservatives spreading Covid whilst spending money going magically save small businesses. Restaurants operate slim margins &amp; 70% Americans comfortable traveling dining indoors, let's hope conservatives eating every meal take slack. 

Most truly wealthy people isolating; Hamptons there's concierge medical service quick Covid tests parties $500 pop. 

What's concerning future recovery many discovered much money save curbing dining out, cooking home horrible. People seeing need designer sunglasses, shoes, etc. Consumer spending take long time recover.   Right mate, calling liar, pointing incredibly pedantic. I'm sure that's takeaway this, victimhood, fact arguing two days possibility production concern despite signs pointing concern promising candidates. Enjoy spending rest day worrying whether maimed badger event that's utterly unfeasible. I'm sheep wanting potentially cause death someone else? makes sense. people, eating continual exposure get “new” people. 

Most us pretty set social circle- family, friends, coworkers. least theory, exposing people repeatedly lower risk.

But eating one common social activities, engaged largest number people, expose “new” people people outside normal social circle. Plus activity involves long time periods lots talking close distances. thus increases risk. I've gone times work, mostly bartend I've getting treated like fucking trash job. assume thats happening places too. week I'll go somewhere new, eat outside, leave good tip. mean know feel least something good proven. is. What's big deal? Get it. bad Intel months ago better information now. called learning part every day life. suggesting actively trying kill everyone? I’ve got friend nurse local hospital. said that’s story tell admitted. suddenly say took precautions, wore mask time, didn’t know anything risky.  think CDC muzzled, it'll look like Germany like town two people could occasionally hang safe exists around here. always outside far everyone better nothing. Schools started anyone lives school kids around avoid cause safety complete joke. get spend fall winter isolating everyone know safe enough. temp job currently leading actual good job I'm stopping end month due nobody working remotely safe begin far less outdoor time. sister walk side room without getting really lighted headed health issues shes year (she's way better compared health bad she'd probably die substantial virus) can't risk getting sick. mental health completely ruined I'm incredibly lonely ride wait heat death universe rapture singularity literally anything eventful set one day apart another. close family gave severe anxiety spikes long corona could potentially sick unknowingly they're high risk makes hide more. wish could afford move sure got downvoted. Like, what, suddenly believe luck superstition, soon 1/1/21 hits gonna whole new shiny world free things humanity done planet lead current situation? Im saying economic turmoil makes public health outcomes worse generally. Look death rates health complications recession. 27 countries European Union plus U.K., Norway, Iceland Liechtenstein recorded 27,233 new cases Wednesday

I'm gonna math tho Yes, I'll sitting quite comfortably sofa, Germany. 5 month old account? Check. Telling people stop spreading misinformation? Check. Posts nothing exaggerated claims backed data? Check.  imagine somehow gets control politicians legalised series bribes! something! can’t figure Sweden well without masks, shutdowns, social distancing. [Sweden [Sweden “Could be” Doesn’t fit narrative? irony Russian operators fuelling Ironically, comment made ""there's proof masks anything outdoors"". kind crap flooding headlines since covid discovered. ""proof"" covid was: transmitted saliva droplets, airborne saliva micro-droplets, could caught children, transmitted children, transmitted infants, deadly healthy people, prevented masks, etc, on. even though things common respiratory viruses throughout history, studies ""proving"" applied covid. Like covid one weird virus obey laws physics. ""minuscule doses get immune system working"" 100% correct far I'm aware (not medical professional) problem people ""you need exposed virus immune system fight it"", lack nuance think groveling feces give immunity, reality talking microbial level. Cant wait see anti-vaccination people using reason wear mask. can’t blame them.

But even get US go right now?  lot closer, won’t ever agree reality. People seem get worked little things like believe Covid not. people work three jobs barely afford house food people ready kill mask person suffering. I’ve eaten restaurant since February, celebrate getting new car. felt super guilty left promptly arriving. haven’t eaten since. Bingo. Anyone half brain going out. bartend LA people orange county coming people traveling LA ""its cheap!"" Lockdowns length recommending worse disease itself. consequences ruinous that's attempted nowhere.

I appreciate point America's poor welfare system end day can't support people working amount time suggesting. consequences would unimaginable, already debt accumulated globally supporting lockdown insane.  discussion ? People like Vitamins ? Oh assumed USA cuz always top stuff seen big money number = USA lol UK flys radar time. Sounds like it’s time get dog van, hit road friend  Central Pennsylvania looking good based new cases per capita. Penn State obvious potential epicenter counties region continue relatively high rates new infections. Looks like upstate New York around Albany another risk area. Nobody tells smile. don’t wear makeup tweeze. Masks great. would much rather 1/16th gram plutonium body 16 Lbs it. need research? virus able infect brain cells isn’t particularly unexpected. human coronaviruses thing (and confirmed actual patients). would odd one couldn’t infect neural cells. crazy lunatics Sweden 5G etc. Also EU crazy people. US always taking massive lead crazy. know, would you? parents 70's last 10 years they've taken ""tin tent"" south winter.

They're going anywhere year. Lol 
You're right, john Hopkins, cambridge oxford university along cdc. terrible sources. 5 minute antibody spit tests I'll know skip annoying mask? country know better month ago

That would Sweden, reporting record low number cases (and deaths) since March, despite massively increased testing.  masks cause autism! Depopulation! So.....mask work? game changer.... Fellow American here, part inaccurate exaggerated? please report garbage therapist. pretty insane got mad gave headache.

you 100% right thing, good safe face peer pressure!  reduction thing. Less bad better whatever normal is.

And might well fitting mask. Ash way larger virus particles even well fit cloth mask going good.

Even stopping 30% dust particles(this # straight ass) that's going noticeable.   really can't stress enough fucking miserable people come restaurants been.


They go thinking everything normal, suddenly explain dont menu know, pandemic, they'll get pissed. go today tell dont football game want, they'll get pissed. service slow im bartending, barbacking, serving 6 tables. They'll get pissed. group 6 hop fence patio skipping $300 check. 


Its honestly terrible. get people coming anyone half brain staying home ordering take most. People like work industry dealing rest. Swedens approach would benefited economy everyone else followed similar approach them. 90% people lockdown ruin economy globalised world.

I take point last major pandemic pre globalisation still account huge levels contraction. 20% contractions seen 2020 far, far higher pandemic modern era. must also remember past pandemics worse treatments diseases far deadlier. Spanish flu example killed many people, especially many people working age, caused much smaller economic contraction currently.

It seems refuse see evidence understand lockdowns greatly exacerbated economic damage worldwide. consequences well even refuse see it. Correlation, causation Yes, process deaths register takes time; instantaneously updated exact moment death happens. United States, 63% deaths processed within 10 days, Covid deaths take longer process, ranging 1 8 weeks depending state.  Ohare terminal 5 pretty bad Tuesday many people weren’t wearing mask wearing chin shit smh that, smokescreen actual conspiracies, actually happening, right front us. conspiracy hide information early lost noise rumors hoaxes Chinese labs. 

How convince people conspiracies real mocking along believing things fake? real problem people dying. real problem getting stick long periods requiring lot care lingering issues potentially life. greatly increases overhead economy must support. So...kinda like vaccine works? more, public health officials actively stigmatized mask-wearing, point reading posts FB reddit threatened violence ""selfish assholes"" wearing masks.

Fauci never ""stigmatized"" wearing masks. still idiots that.

Moreso, they're putting US risk actual biological attacks, since country shown weak avenue attack. think lie originated president. real. seen devastating toll. karens never wear mask get it. think knows third depression, /u/kontekisuto business like that. Everyone says additional cleaning. dont. think movies never coming back? Typically vaccine development takes 18 months, math start could figure two years Hahahahaha haha. Yes. Yes have. Since February (though people “didn’t know Covid”...however read saw amount pneumonia cases wasn’t hard discern cause) mean cult conservatism happened. Facebook amplified propaganda. well mean, poor Peeps. Life must hard you’re illiterate Exactly. people think Berlin Wall put intention separating families? always ostensibly 'good' reasons authoritarian measures. doctor pointed office protocol covid19 flue outbreak. staff works mitigate viral load office, prescreening patients prior entering office, face masks maximum hygiene. public response covid19 extension known protocol. hypothetical points article makes part based volume historically proven methods. get results, follow protocols,. facts eventually known.  less safe normal, may heard we're middle pandemic.
Do source saying flu risk time year age group?

Other places managed zero community transmission leading restrictions lifting.
I'm going assume vaccine available yet work. strange pick two countries, presumably, nearly two dozen must voted resolution whole (since 169 193 voted it, two named abstaining).

I suppose makes sense name US, since superpower, would Israel important others? Never ceases amaze lack empathy people have, guess totally explains world right now. Yeah, saw UK basically preparing mass casualty event fall winter. say happen, definitely good idea prepare worst case scenario. Isn’t Government full enough monkeys quota met? India started. civil aviation authority issued confusing set orders airports saying planes China turned around everyone temperature tested. Problem is...no one knew supposed implement it. spent days going back forth airport operators Government trying figure going on. Ministry Civil Aviation said Directorate General Civil Aviation. said Ministry Home Affairs. told us Ministry Health. 

For longest time, India's policy test people contact known case symptoms. obviously problem disease large percentage people symptoms. cities finally went lockdown, MILLIONS people part formal economy fled back rural homes, likely taking virus them. rural areas exceedingly limited resources. 

Then government DESPERATE recognized world power, providing obvious incentive control narrative response crisis. article sums pretty well (for reference, lakh Nope. Naaa knows latest leaked recording proves it. said want panic anyone.  are. dunno. think they're capable calm, reasoned, discussion.

If seen another human since mid-march.

My girlfriend climbing walls, 'out every day restaurants' type, definitely needs social interaction.

We discussed like adults certain things mutually agreed risky finding compromise stopped losing plot entirely.

It's easy, instinct light anyone gets closer two meters fire, sheds less so. also assess risks differently regard infection. we're managing. wearing mask you’re reducing (or eliminating) viral load. Ask health care professional getting drive-through pick grandma holy SHIT like three restaurants outside PACKED without room parking dine-in eating. Lots big groups congregating maskless. I've lived years say beyond shadow doubt restaurants crowded COVID - like people defying shit purpose (or they've flooded restaurants closed). Shit man, people FL love act like thing exist. Ought held without bail. one wants hear harsh truth, restrictions slowly expanded every month.

Imagine telling public back March they'd stop basic life five six months. That's whole picture. large suburbs similar measures time. Shortly whole city went lockdown remains now. Cases declining significantly though.

Admittedly tower lockdown somewhat unique large group people considered close contacts go strict isolation (no leaving home reason). restrictions travel also kept taking root states key limiting fallout. ridiculous child care seen safe opening schools not. 

i'n preschool teacher, see close proximity 15 3-5 year old students every week safer older children coming school. best keep kids socially distanced never perfect. sickness spreads like wildfire normal year matter much clean. i'm terrified something like happening. center increased class sizes - mine went 7 15 - feel like matter time. sounded like ""but there's chance work, continue already KNOOOOOW gone.""

Still, makes uncomfortable hear someone say vaccine ""fix"" this. Obviously wearing masks staying six feet apart enough... was, would situation.  everything said, that's thing able comment on. I'll consider resignation then. 

And worry, name believe i'm equal fill shoes. liked pay refference historical figure respect. Well mean keep getting colder yes, would someone born 1970's I'll agree you. Anything 2001 crap. 

Edit 1971 police seem think everyone carrying gun guns America citizens. would weird assume everyone gun? co-morbidities?

Once all, could people like fuck off?

She Doctor, taking possible precautions dealing sick people.

All want know ""co-morbidities""? Like sort ""win"" side? Beating shit old man asking selfish asshole *not* pure evil.

But then, far someone equally disgusting name belief system know that. Meanwhile Georgia Tech things control. initial surge associated frats enough asymptomatic surveillance tests test whole population weekly nip outbreaks, they're 90/day move-in/frat surge 15 per day. America great yet? guess minded business French bus driver beaten eventually died asking teens wear masks. virus dies 135* F. incinerate food, sure safe. Hot food safe. get cold food takeout. Yes, children man... ones driving country ground. 3ft terror...

/s ""Your business"" ends right die strapped breathing tube begins I... struggling words describe ignorance hubris. 

You idea talking about. lived it. might sound crazy today, upon time, test donated blood. check babies disease made syphilis look like birthday party. People hooked time unprotected sex. long gal pill, fuck it, party time. get STD, trip doc shot ass pills takes care it. 

I'm hoping SOMEONE generation chimes add thoughts. comment born cavalier ignorance.

To you, world HIV ""normal.""

That case grew up. 

COVID-19 going cause changes. new ""normal,"" 2019. Brazil here. won’t. People don’t learn others mistakes. Yes, France made unsafe Africans Africa made unsafe French... turntables...

Well, person seems pretty darned dangerous me, given gratuitous rather savage actions, $30000 low sum get bail bondsman. still think gives measure law (or judge) thinks crime. Lol. 

I recognize name, fill shoes. one bit. Sweden also one highest deaths per capita. never tried contain France lockdown good lifted sent kids school causing numbers spike again. Pretty clear happening. Good. HIPAA intended prevent keeping people healthy, needs overruled. Graduation day.  It’s really big deal. isn’t going change life meaningful way. think US high enough incarceration rate is. high, considering they're releasing tons people ""lol jails corona safe"".  THATS RIGHT. kudos mod ! thanks keeping subreddit dignified It’s unbelievable, anti mask world still strong ever, feels like everyone else given up... deleted fb app get angry family members gone back normal worse. didn’t need know sister law selfish dipshit she’d sign petition bring high school football back town...and kid doesn’t even play football...

Edit- thank reminding still sane thinking people world! I’m sorry friends &amp; families idiotic mine!! Call cops? Lol. cops even wear masks.  Yup, never know psychotically violent retaliate. people unhinged That's COVID, original article post common colds general, even coronavirus-caused ones, despite Reddit title. Beautiful. idea relates topic hand. many times teach lesson, old man? kept repeating excuse like hear anything said negates excuse reminds many conversations I've lately. Noah fence, good news? asking. live college town. mix ages people eating restaurants. I’m guessing you’re going family friendly restaurants family younger people likely go (think bar food venues). Marc Aurel, Marcus Aurelius Roman Emperor known writing meditations, significant books history philosophy. i'm surprised recognize name. one bit.

Anyway, constructing wild assumptions think without even remotely knowing think. basing empty assumption caricature drawn head anything opposes faith instincts conspiracy theories.

I rely nuclear-fire storm political hate. attribute intent human incompentence stupidity large explain phenomena well.

And particularly care Trump talks to. world leaders job 'work with' leaders every nation across globe ensure peace prosperity respective populations. 

What asking whether believe Trump actively working american interest favor Russia, would say does. neither aware it, Russia 'turned russian spy'. Putin simply benifitting fact America, moment collective Idioticy voted Reality-TV celeb known abrasive asshole walks life oval office instead elect someone would Putins intellectual equal.

You blame alot China. call fascist, anti-western state actively trying undermine democratic western values. call shithole humans rights violations. blaming COVID china, without evidence, moronic. know fact virus 'began' china, cannot make entire nation responsible emergence virus nature. That'd like rest world blaming america HIV.

As China playing 'pathogens/virus/bacteria 'greater good' ', shows nonexistant understanding science. Every single nation world 'playing pathogens/virus/bacteria'. called research, produce medicine, vaccines, attempt figure ways fight said pathogens, research beneficial use pathogens/virus/bacteria.

But means, keep speaking things clearly seem little understanding about. position i'd emberassed ashamed talk people 'blind objective' science clearly even understanding simple cognitive biases. It’s wildly funny see people like knowing anything industry read article upvoted, comment actually know they’re talking getting downvoted. uncommon practice push drug line could considered effective. It’s practice various statistical groups tried stop companies fro doing. Rovester Ingram hope fam. hope so. mention ""coronavirus"" anywhere, generically ""common colds"".

It's bait, pretty good bait opinion... shows myocardial inflammation, look it, common occurrence viral episodes. makes findings post-COVID-19 little less scary, guess. embaraamssing europe...such bad leadership. Idk are, around way 99% people know would behave way

This woman definitely punished think saying 1% Americans would behave responsibly comical “flaw” ‘Normal’ hmmmmm prior pandemic??????? Voting ain’t answer Let guess: go places like Denny's Olive Garden. ""Pure evil"" Well fair Dakota's social distanced due low population densities. quote someone else?

maybe should. 

""The reason many people gravitating towards conspiracy theories nothing else trust anymore. Ethical journalism died long time ago, buried behind lobbyism political activism.... Truth nowhere found point, allegiance 'feels right'. I'd argue believe we're actively lied every imaginable level wrong principle.""

So side mouth gonna talk of, now, dear? places continue see high numbers outbreaks deaths. It’s back normal it’s one cares family get sick. LAST 7 DAYS |Contagions: 53,158 (+3.38 %) Hospitalizations: 2,191 ( +2.8%) Deaths: 241(-3.2%)

So 241 last 7 days. want belive numbers lying goverment gives probably 25-50% really is... like end march numbers far ""nobody really dying anymore.""

Im gonna guess next post : ""Its totally safe visit Spain tourists spend many euros posible here.""

Wonder much money people making lying goverment social networks.

Yea, shouldn’t allowed, companies able constantly review data see drug working well say “if enroll X number subjects power trial say it’s effective.” finished cold determined cold main symptoms runny nose fatigue covid rarely gives u runny nose begin bc anything dries 415,000 deaths? Okay lets ignore fact fact despite 6 months havent even reached half number yet 7 day average dropping month now. average nearly 2k deaths day everyday reach number havent many deaths one day since beginning May. could see us, regretably, reaching 300k end year, 400k. Yep... local public transportation says sure, sit people again.

So much stupid go around; especially 'everybody' scheduled go back work. shoulder shoulder transit standing. Bail isn’t punishment. simply method ensure someone shows trial. someone dangerous released, bail set.  Here's US 7-day running smooths daily fluctuations. 

And states ranked 7-day average arguments idiotic. assume full lockdown preventative measure.

Many countries economies reasonably well fighting virus.

Usually enforced mask policies, support place effective quarantine fast testing.

You even get different states even agree masks good idea.

Get house order  strange times reasonable request lead violence. now. stock market elevated illusion. It’s due crash swear shit see santa decorations face masks outta limited testing April. Antibody tests showed NYC case counts hundreds thousands actual number millions. sub seems favor indefinite lockdowns. That’s solution plan, virus it’s endemic. need learn evidence-based risk tolerance blunt tools lockdowns, can’t keep indefinitely, risk likely never going go zero COVID-19 like before. know want take upvote, take upvooooooooote need, article showing ongoing myocardial inflammation 60% cases, 3 months infection. Mild asymptomatic cases included. disease going biggest major damage pandemic do. Imagine 30 million additional heart disease patients, millions 30-40 year olds heart attacks following years, USA alone.

Never mind, let's focus low death rate instead. think double blinding important regardless sample size. know receiving placebo (or Vice versa) might change behaviour affect results. google him, perpetrator _veeeery_ rough looking 24; he’d easily pass mid-to-late 30s opinion. reason considered dicks charge. pay politicians all. USA #1 ... 

worst country world don’t think that’s accurate. lot people don’t believe dangerous represented, doesn’t exist. Note back March... whole thing hypothetical. there's point nitpicking numbers seeing hardly shocking thing statement. They're sending terrorists murderers... realize staying home forever, covid not, possibly save somebody’s life killing car spreading another virus them. actually correct. Hypothesis theory. Mixing two words one biggest pet peeves misunderstood word public. The've saying thing since march. knew sure markets would behave would sell margin make big. life cheap, owning life expensive? That's decision make. change fact latest cdc guidelines make harder get test. Tuesday colleague went covid test. left home wife higher risk displaced test results came back yesterday evening. company also shut entire week. tried get test play safe nope. Due CDC guidelines allowed test asymptomatic. 5 days get test result back theory people could spreading unchecked. chance hell us reporting accurate numbers based fact people denied tests.  Unfortunately :( please safe! Good luck 1000 healthcare workers died. merit like kind memorial. telling people full details tragic event happened lying severity contagious virus, jackass. Probably around time became widely accepted women teach supplemental income, husbands earn real money households. know growing 80s heard people around say many times teachers actually women whose children left college women bored needed something day. Okay, regardless feel process go, still takes long get public impact, timeline doesn’t really change much. Plus still time vaccine hits market general mass public adopt solution, public impact looking change policies get new normal old normal. Buckle go easy young, foolish, wealthy, every young, foolish, wealthy person expect leniency. Sentences deter. faced zero reprecussions. think scientists sometimes hesitant make decisions due polarized people be.

They quick advice masks though. Aha hahaha. crazy nut job. 

Yeah, dude cave using flip phone dial WiFi. Politics put us position first place politics going resolve issue. Nice logic.

“The fine sucks he’s rich pay it, he’s rich severe consequences.”

So consequences 10 people die downstream transmission event? 

Does dropping school seem little reasonable context? 

You could’ve conducted thought process own. human incapable thinking past length arm? Oh wow. Im living student apartment area Sweden people house parties every week. Wish country took corona seriously means infected getting higher lower viral loads, reckon?  grew extreme poverty, lot gas-lighting negate fear caretakers. much prevented real planning adapting reality presented. 

Becoming adult painful enlightening process acknowledging reality adapting--like steering boat instead drifting listlessly. easy, great long term survival mental health.

But really, kind denial evident across political system climate change subject. ostrich mine field. Everybody platform realize 25% Americans believe Sun revolves around Earth. honestly makes sense terms understand world HIT too. every person world need vaccinated thing driven straight ground weakened common cold. best family, reason anyone anything. friends wanted eat out. said I'd rather take food back house. Luckily they're going oblige, cause interest, even seeing article. context:


They died unsafe working conditions fines work to, let’s see,.

$20,000 divided 200 $100 each. 

That’s government decided worth. don’t teach shit  mean proposed hypothesis. making misunderstanding word ""theory"" worse already is. Theories thoroughly researched. Hey, here's thought, let's make lobbying firms non-profit corporations funnel profits catch tax breaks! California entered chat around $12,794.99 USD American money.

That's half day ICU need intensive care Covid way. one person. Thank you. I've heard people wearing 2 masks. think I'll couple weeks school especially. really feel like normal world, would required whole family stays home, school. us iowa...ugh. I'm going check state guidelines exposure situation. 

I'm going watch symptoms sure...so far none us showing symptoms. say appalled learned let us know early test results Korea make could help. Luckily enough smart enough understand instruction changed sort knowledge occurred catalyst change (in case better supply masks)... Many smart move along changes. wish questioned earlier statement wear them. would hurt that?... Besides people's feelings cases least they're honest time

I mean, UK goverment estimating 100k actual daily cases March, means already thousands daily cases late Jan

The fact they're coverup mode time means wont get bad March Maybe

But least snitch Personally, think community spread would stop vulnerable shelter place. Immunocompromised people still sometimes need grocery shop go doctor. Even though frustrating put lives hold fault restaurants closing lie individual consumer even smaller, local governments. businesses federal support beginning. reason ppl thread want shutdown half assed shutdown going longer shutdown could easily short term shutdown gotten whole thing control like developed countries. They're going second waves right we're still first. really think healthcare system even equipped handle herd immunity experiment, especially flu season coming. goal keep businesses closed indefinitely, short effective solution would enable reopen safely get business close normal. Unfortunately can't happen gov gives peanuts people drag restrictions spreading around stuff like that. Good. wanted OP look realize. See commenter math.

If say things same, better worse someone else says ""no they're not"" think objector explain. Order take buy gift card. estimate total infections worldwide based seriously inexact statistics. rescent estimate read 10% total. Given covid19 accelerating Europe, India etc. arn't past peak herd immunity. 

There 4+ known cases re-infection. Also 100's cases long term damage heart, brain etc. herd immunity looking like good plan. 741 million living Europe (as headline says), vs 328 - bad Bloomberg dint know difference EU Europe. 

There 446 million living EU, adding 66 million living UK gives 512 million europeans. yea certainly more. Police beating people compliance quite commonplace India. extrajudicial punishment. Agreed 100%! tutorials came fabric hoarding donated homemade masks flipped upwards 10 dollars each.

For every good being, there's least ten crap beings.  God's, hope not! mean seen man-boobs guys! 🤢🤢🤢  isnt much happens youve allready lost control party then.

Call police report uninvited guests maximum showed refuse leave asked. Much less likely you’ll get charged then. conservative subs FILLED t_d posters Life apparently cheap. :( Happy cake day think they're referring casual racism. Fucking 5 year olds understand 'don't party', rocket science. puts EWQ (gen z) blamed seems like ""adaptive immunity"" fancy way saying ""herd immunity."" So, uh, no. shit. I've wearing mask retail 6 months. blame customers coming in. us choice need money working since there's safety net place. He's killing people's grannies, would charge attempted murder. got lightly. think already before, bad got flu, also 20. Mine pretty well controlled meds lifestyle changes. makes life much harder. Simple things, like standing like 15 minutes morning, make feel sick day. I'm one lucky ones.. son died 2 months 12 days old 20 years ago. I'm ""ok"" too.

Sending e-hug friend. Wait, tested negative early stages still infect others? mentioned 9/11. Doesnt make sense me. Neither handled well cost hundred thousands innocent lives. Go GOP!!!   comment often referred “a joke”  right . another group like call “Disneyland families “ , every member obese can’t imagine activity isn’t consumer based. Well haven’t tested positive Covid once. spread connection many people virtually, I’m great. Cummings even sacked? keeping story.

Edit: getting downvoted for... asking question. Sure. Yeah, post-apocalyptic sci-fi story... Set post-nuclear war timeline. Heyyyyyy like Trumps followers!  Evidence source? Imagine can’t pay business school, don’t study CPA exam you’re busy taking care family, working job, trying survive, work hard yet still can’t pay community college? want save 20 30% income spend money cheapest stuff survive still don’t enough? It’s great good financial skills quite frankly people don’t resources and/or don’t means learn financial skills. okay, know self-centered fucks.   Well Reddit said European governments giving free money citizens stay home forever. people stupid. Either they'll regard another infection akin flu, deaths inevitable. Ignoring much deadlier been. apple one. Put country compare.

Here google mask wearing agree Canada less Covid.

What think people wrong why. people simply assume shut longer, deeper, earlier, fewer anti-maskers. None supported data.

Less people doesn’t necessarily matter. Urbanization rates close identical.

Edit:

Here mask context:

There 500,000 meat plant workers US.

Of general population ~330M USA, 200,000 died COVID, 0.06% general population died COVID. 200 500,000 meat workers died, 0.04% died.

Conclusion: COVID fatality rate among meat plant workers probably general population. land boarders, flying never restricted. honestly want know society change Facebook deleted overnight. It’s easier spit bullshit it’s group people saying thing howling lose confidence stupid ideas amazed. paper discuss hypothesis prior viral infections—either SARS-CoV-2 different strains coronaviruses, potentially even respiratory viruses—may predispose severe forms COVID-19, following secondary infection SARS-CoV-2. Ahh yes, phrase ""Sorry can't let people in."" never invented? Umm read fucking currency, jesus call protest hold outside instead. Fool Yeah, I'm tired people calling government with: ""people dying COVID, COVID"".


Ffs, COVID triggers lot complications ended death, COVID cause death.


I keep seeing people calling: ""but implies someone dies car accident test positive COVID, registered COVID death"". saw clearly felt dont need therapy anymore. maybe cured already! wouldn’t it?  must usually underlying condition causing eat, think especially babies/small kids. saying happening even pandemic?? Oh totally agree. read wrote? grandmother made clear peace death. begging death years came. felt sorry her. think able die sooner soon wanted to. 

Not everyone mourning. know them. abusive father died covid tomorrow, would mourn. emotionally verbally abused mother years.

Sorry cold hard facts family hurt ""narrative"" old people want die. people care family members die either old suffering already estrangement abuse etc. 

It wish professionals would held account People try create self fulfilling prophecy around this. First justifying behavior, convincing (and others) everyone else first anyway, grow there. Agreed. basically quarantined entirely essential trips early June. time realized we'd dealing really long time pretty much said screw it. began hanging people small settings, going eat (mostly outdoors), golfing, etc. still vigilant masks, washing hands, social distancing possible such, need life life order live. things open mean people going. friends used regularly dinners, happy hours, gym classes, etc. maybe 5% used do. limiting spread Yeah, insidious blue agenda wear mask, quick widespread testing, contact tracing, staying crowded indoor spaces much possible really dangerous.

Just look basically every country world? suckers go back work normal daily life! wants 40,000 new cases day forever!

I hope keep owning dumb liberals! (I say I'm registered Reepublicaan). parents talking masks vaccines recently, compared polio vaccine kids. said back day, nobody argued it. got damn shot that. expert opinion published NEJOM, one top medical journals world mean, trying say ""the government putting abnormal amounts pressure people protect other, time encouraging civil war, WTF?"" totally agree you. issue took quote talked whole portion US population expendable. Nice! can’t deal anti-mask BS. needs saying things get people board. commenting aren’t effective. He’s example highly intelligent person idea massage message get buy public. Fauci hand master it. best answer don’t know country’s money you’re referring referring “20 cent coin”—my country (USA) doesn’t 20 cent coins. also made wonder 50 cent coin country compares yours. Yeah guy totally masks altogether 

Its odd someone credentials. think mask fucked girlfriend something Indiana University well. uncommon far amount time shutdown - that’s issue have. It’s California imo state done sort decent job besides opening bars early getting massive second surge. 

Unfortunately, part agree salons reopening allowed to. clean environment trained certified cross contamination pathogens. work safe open 3.5 weeks minute there, shut cases surged. Everyone wore masks. Everyone good. community spread state tattoo shops made sure adhere guidelines reopen including limiting foot traffic, taking appointments, outside food drink, client come alone etc. 

This isn’t really case “we shut long serious pandemic” case “we shut long little assistance relief still paying expenses nobody could help us thought better assist small businesses pandemic.” Sorry dude, rough everyone.  really put lot stress lot people like many others (me too). Luckily drink ordered 17 masks amazing prints I’m ready. Let’s fall winter thing. Yea I'm sure sure I'll able afford private school time kids old enough, know we're going asses homework keeping progress. least them. Well, experts EU agree me, quarantining elderly lived lives already, done children younger people still need socialization education pose risk mental health issues isolation still whole lives ahead 

So quarantining will? Sounds like prison me. stop elderly tho? People risk severe co-morbidities (asthmatic, obese, etc...) quarantined well. read study PoC risk COVID? quarantining well?

""Want exit house? Stop obese"". wonderful fascist world !!! Indeed. People want act like guy great yet damn well knew start masks made difference, could not? yet chose political puppet later dismisses actions excuse needed save masks health workers true lie instruct ppl make home. lies start helped plant seeds minds unintelligent still grow day. Would agree science never sucks though? Maybe consider different news sources. vet also curbside - masks mandatory well entire person-to-person interaction. Thank God they're caving that. McConnel trying really hard slip immunity there......people harmed negligence ability go trial. Getting vaccine absolve COVID precautions. likelihood, vaccine 100% effective. Even was, still act vector disease. vaccine give carte blanche stop wearing mask, staying home, social distancing, etc Well 100 years ago similar anti-mask movements.  100 years don’t high level confidence much different. risk bus probably lower everyone masked entirety ride. restaurants people take masks eat. Thus opening first seal.... dont obviously (ಠ_ಠ)

Fine... here’s upvote Correct prosperity,  fortunate channel name, accurate topics, way mainstream, also PhD pathology Pfizer executive. locked international travel fast shut Wuhan airport, probably mess.

Instead, shutting domestic, CCP shouting racist shut international flights. countries fared worse US regard coronavirus, it’s random. seem think inevitable, wasn’t, It’s due actions leadership people. Companies calling office workers back lose something outside office work remotely held account. Thankfully company work taking things seriously, shouldn’t depend work for. homeschooled son six years (2007-2012) I’m 100% pro vax 
Some us sane! Masks definitely protect individual wish marketed like cdc instead going care bear route selfish people lol  bold assume 100 years deadliest, contagious Well people incredibly stupid really doesn’t much matter tell them.

They’ll believe want believe Pretty good article - kept fresh know? One day say immune response long lasting another say one data saying? trying argue aren’t financial hardship. wondering showing visual data set show much 100% due vaccine coincidence? happened Wuhan, China lifted quarantine too.  remember reading spike divorces. 

Glances spouse nervously.... Party boats accidents waiting happen. accept risk norovirus one surprise someone else would accept different risk? people want make sound like making sacrifices even one year basically death. like, kind propaganda campaign get us wave white flag stop trying fight virus. lot inauthentic.  yeah lol Peak prosperity,

?? knew india getting hit harder numbers telling us video still youtube channel

[Can masks protect new coronavirus quote. cough, fever difficulty breathing, wear mask seek medical care. symptoms, wear mask, evidence protect people sick

So yeah, early year mask advice shit show. Rudolph

Rudolph gonna Dicknose.  Masks aren’t benefit. others benefit. Honestly, I'd agree vehement hatred people lie shit that's easily disproven. 


But remember I'm tired care fuck it, I'm lot unconfirmed cases then, I'd argue now. Also divorces come financial hardships time there’s already financial strain. trying times many. Covid looming election USA, weirdest Hallowe'en ever. Right able get mask cdc tell folks weren’t effective. 

If come jump said that, obtaining mask would much harder thinking finally getting shot arm brought tears day. One day it'll happen. deserve. economist portal cookies, impossible read vet curbside  probably right. bet know...but cdc came beginning recommended masks would reduced number people putting fight. good news want vaccines, well-tested vaccines particular.

If want things, well... um... think probably consider possibility might sort Prince Evil. Ngl sometimes feel like might even take longer mean there's excuse government fuck-ups either. absence political context, can't imagine anyone stupid enough believe masks help.

As mixed messaging... excuse explanation. People easily misled. truth huge proportion people WANT virus spread think that's easier way get ""over done with"". Though, scientists side, so... believe denature (kill) anti-bacteria lysozyme protein tear. Also tear absorbs UVC, harmful compounds maybe produced. So, don’t look UVC lamp. Well, experts EU agree me, quarantining elderly lived lives already, done children younger people still need socialization education pose risk mental health issues isolation still whole lives ahead them. 

Also, know san asymptomatic case spreading virus around? grandma! 
Take issue vote. huge part problem also government fucked us.

But understand way thinking outs everyone risk, including grandma.

(Btw tell grans covid fun, relative 60's healthy spend 4 months hospital died end, without family say goodbye, I'm sure thought that) Next month choose groceries credit cards. Discover won’t miss meal, neither family. Yup fucked big time want toddler able socialize. That’s biggest wish. First measles. this. want kid able get play kids age. Born 88 consider 90's kid. much going know about. I'm grown looking around. think myself....have asleep whole existence. happened society, evolved now. pretty amazing depressing time. last job forcing nursing staff COVID19 testing without adequate PPE. nurse got sick, threatened fire missed work. worked whole shift telling one docs tested came back COVID positive several days later. presented workmans comp visits employer services called corporate threatened retribution medical provider filled WC paperwork stating illness likely work related. fired bunch medical assistants refusing provide patient care patients COVID compatible symptoms without masks due increased demand cost PPE. one bad company. buddy works Seattle whole ED told assigned N95 respirator patient confirmed COVID+. assessing, running nebs, possibly intubating, hour later rapid COVID test comes back positive, respirator signed nursing supervisor. Otherwise, provide own. 

Theres going shit ton litigation front line medical nursing staff forced work unsafe working conditions got sick. 

If one good thing comes this, legislation explicitly requiring adequate PPE front line medical staff. Federal law requires construction workers assigned hard hats protection. fact healthcare workers buy N95s goggles Amazon insane me. would absolutely close bridge 2% chance breaking. I’m going able keep winter patios aren’t option. I’m upper Midwest. people keep things 50% capacity like hopefully won’t massive issue. businesses won’t survive otherwise.   People generally *really* bad risk assessment probability. Add confirmation bias denial wonder can't make long term trade off. know relevant? Whatever, everything fuel objectively ignoring truth. I'm done avoiding giving ""stuff go of"" give flying fuck truth facts first place. I'm curious see smoke affects infection rates. People walking around shopping, outside certainly wearing masks now. weird comparison. Yes, they're secret. mask wearing social isolation.

Expat community looked policies China own, host country's government anything. school opening surge beginning materialize. Nah, it'll easy draw comparison whatever issue stupidly politicised 5/10/20/etc. Years. hear you. also wear mask. pointing cdc created lot confusion mistrust initial statement needing wear masks. Trust me, one-time thing. mini vacation didn’t want home-stuck much. brought wanting go much last place went. frigg ""failure thrive""? go hospital thriving? that's case hospital speak vet earlier - i’ve known lady 5 years always upmost respect family 

they’re christian - lots kids - home schoolers - kinda assumed might “anti vax” .. - she’s great elderly dog nothing kind old hippy self 

today walked room saw mask said “i didn’t think you’d mask person ... mind take mine ? wear show around front office area”

my heart DROPPED — can’t believe anyone that’s finished grade higher 8, anti science anti mask

this like 13 hours ago i’m still baffled kinda pissed 

i also need find new vet :( history class 100 years now, kids going able understand how/why people fucking stupid unwilling listen science. It’s 2020 damn Middle Ages yet apparently thing deal with. way seeing domestic air travel recovery good news? done ""Draconian"" measures see recovery would bad news. fact people hubei suffered, extreme cases suffering inhumane, deserve see recovery otherwise would nothing. Hanging friends family without masks would good start Yes correct it’s still another reason might good wear mask along others. yet idiots still refuse wear. doesn’t make slightest bit sense. lol truth people complying dont care, know masks benefit, choose willfully ignorant certain obvious reasons know hummm, wonder people tend remember bad dreams good deeper sleep brings people deeper sleep often therefore dreams. Half people works half doesn't. Simple math mongolia opposite china. democracy better usa. ? Go cry. makes love blossom: choosing close someone often

What makes love fade: close someone often  long piece string?  even visited Germany? 

If have, determined place you, start finding legit reason get residence permit. Americans means, almost exclusively, finding job.

And job, job requires specialized experience and/or dire shortage German EU workers. require speak German? looking STEM jobs (with tilt towards IT) basically. ways, theory, personally know non-EU citizens pulled without job offer prior moving.

If serious, research make estimation hard spouse, kids. can't even begin guess. convincing someone believes everything wrong country favor lie. People love look world like black white, always shade grey. nice night tell Xi said hi next time see him. Username checks Umm...

I think virus gets multiply probably amount without mask.

Coz body deteceted virus starts attacking symptoms come. turns vaccine masks wore along way. think important remember survival rate 99.999% oh gosh arent abject worst everything ok cant possibly improved sure anyone ever told you, reddit based America, posters American, America going feature heavily discussions countries. closed environment others wearing mask, especially people exerting breathing heavily. least am, rule 6' distance outside. Inside, masks required. another Canadian, please also organize keep border closed dumpster fire south brought hard control. Show one research paper supports significant portion contracting COVID suffer long term complications. truth is, don’t won’t - you’re rejecting *hypothesis* you’re scared conflicts world view, blame propaganda instead. 

Burden proof one ""hypothesis"". something reddit disagrees (e.g., religion)? Money power, hedging bets stock market. know global pandemic needs mask way. 
Step 1) don’t tell anyone 
Step 2) sell airline stocks buy PPE medical supply stocks
Step 3) tell rich powerful buddies secret. 
Step 4) play dumb cash Americans die. 
Easy enough understand.
The government inside traders. saw literally get caught it. Think like 4-5 republican senators I’m wearing masks say fucking sick articles use words “might” “could”. want concrete definitive information. Please. School started two weeks ago, exact duration incubation time (we knew long time). Also least live, South, people take care much begining.

Even 10k DAY, school remains open person. go tomorow fear health best know positive case class. Yes... AOL AIM Surge, Pogs, Squeeze-Its, Dunakroos jelly shoes! Ouch bubble gum bandaids Fruitopia! Running around neighborhood friends, drinking hose heading home streetlights came on. Never taking pictures meals, never phones constantly, growing without social media... Oh miss childhood simplicity 90s. Tamagachis String Things!  Sure, completely undeveloped countries without real medical infrastructure. What's America's excuse? So... Turns masks vaccine?? STONKS Let's try Wittgenstein:


 try define ""culture"" find called ""family ressemblance"" ie find diverse characteristics able say defines culture.


If get back OP:


 find ""throwing bricks ambulances"" shared people ""culture"" (whatever is) ""others"".


The option go ""no true swede"" : put brown star everybody throw bricks. Canada prefer use prisons, find much ""us"" ""them"".  pretty funny hear things say us liberals home complaining bad everything is.

Americans actually pretty high list shitty work conditions exploited employers. People don’t die car accidents, die blunt force impacts. find n95 masks long ago November 2019 know use regularly allergies find anything anywhere. see true. I’m “long hauler” - (got March) I’m support groups. Especially loss smell taste. seems coming people got March/April worse long term symptoms. Whereas got June/July seem recovering sooner. theory thrown lot groups virus getting less bad. maybe people exposed high dose able fight better. 

I think there’s little bit want bit hope things getting better though! 1. not
2. fuck care?
3. fuck anyone care do? matter. Irrelevant. Nobody move finger unless hospitals get overrun. That's authorities responsible thing care about. Millions get long-term damage disease concerns nobody. staying home Symptoms waiting results disgusting. know Housekeeping it? Michael Osterholm, Director CIDRAP, regularly calls bad science like weekly podcast.

""And hypothesized was, wore face cloth covering, called mask, really define talking about, lesser dose inhaled virus mild asymptomatic disease, developed protection. there's lick data supports concept all. reason I'm concerned that, fact, read hear someone, would say, well, know what? I'm gonna go public face cloth covered I'm going distance.""

""I'm going go right everybody, might tonight might lucky night get infected mild virus level therefore I'm protected. dangerous make point. would say, short, we've gone length. make statements lower dose. clue they're talking about. There's dosage data here. We're work right looking infectious doses, know, we've working animal model people look is. we're looking likely needing infectious dose humans virus, probably somewhere order ten two, very, very, low. that's infect people say lower dose. We've also seen evidence dose animal studies actually affect outcome, though differ age genetics co morbidities animals. take old macaques diabetes overweight infected low dose, still come very, serious disease young macaques, even healthy ones higher doses, still mild, asymptomatic infection. dose may actually even less important individual getting infected. paper sense well face cloth covering actually reduces inhalation. know heard talk before, concerns issues aerosols inhaled they're exhaled, exhaled out. cited studies using hamsters actually misinterpreted information. made seem like somehow dosage delivered hamsters would actually show hamsters got less, really less illness. fact, airflow. many things. worst concern paper lead people actually let guard. distance. we're going see many infections.""

""Osterholm Update"" podcast transcript link Osterholm CIDRAP IMO best unbiased source COVID info throughout pandemic. warned coming Feb 20th, warned needed talk aerosol spread back March, never afraid say know. Seriously hour week podcast worth guy regularly contact best people there. France jumped 7% live (south, touristic area). ...and knows many short, medium long term effects. Collage athletes getting heart inflamation, study China showed microscopic brain damage even low symptom survivors. That's thing called NOVEL virues - nobody yet knows since around less year.

I'm eager human lab animal experiment thanks people hissy fit wearing mask. want feel like bones fire lungs full melted lead elephant chest week two much less find I'm one effects last regular pneumonia flu. weird considering it’s *respiratory* sickness. BC, Canada. places see people closer 6 feet wearing masks certain grocery stores require medical establishments. Everywhere else, unless required people it. Including job, 15 people huddle together every morning boss discuss work duties single person wears mask. Maybe go Vancouver I'll see masks everyone, outside metro area noticeable demographic see taking seriously medical professionals. uplifting information. Bollocks Fauci gone record, multiple times, stating shortage initial outbreak prompted that. topic think spread? infected individuals.

What truly disgusting someone displaying symptoms, waiting test result, going pubs regardless. woman could quite feasibly handed someone death sentence may lived 20 years longer otherwise. Now, know that, rest sane world knows that, assume knew that.

It's American thing we've England.   Sorry, didn’t actually say later. “One things [the general public] shouldn’t going buying masks … proven effective preventing spread coronavirus amongst general public … Folks don’t know wear properly tend touch faces lot, actually increase spread coronavirus. increase risk getting wearing mask healthcare provider.”

He literally told people shouldn’t going buying masks, they’ve proven prevent spread. He’s since gone back, Fauci, tell public shameful. Extend Sweden's deaths country size USA get 200,000 dead far, obviously really bad. fact health care system able handle numbers actually impressive, though.

6.757% 6.5 million 439,205. Sweden lower rate infection much higher death rate infected. ruling class cops military enforce rules working class nothing(some cheering cops) 80 death 11/9... Yes, without sarcasm. everyone wearing masks otherwise mingling much possible gets us herd immunity faster, I'm it. way little, days. didn't? Welding people apartments happened rare instances due local vigilantism repeated quarantine breakers. central government said excessive actually helpful disease prevention told people knock off? actual pandemic measures easily visible: social distancing, movement restriction, wearing masks, contact tracing etc. things countries kind side totalitarianism, oppression, cruelty.

I think history kind imperialist, racist propagandists, fortunate seems history moving right direction. wow bad nobody wasn’t already wearing mask gonna believe every time hear something virus it’s dumber less believable  state safety ordinance wear masks working indoors, report police station. They're knowingly creating work hazard. FUCKING NOT.


And disguise fact US STILL CONTROL!

Fucking gee, rocket science. Prosperity Gospel Protestant Work Ethic created country entitled assholes sneer poor Americans good normalizing abnormal things. true? Sweden's economy fucked neighbouring countries

People keen go spend travel thousands dying many thousands bed ridden days potential lung damage selecting bits convenient ignoring require actual effort like love quote Old Testament parts homosexuality love shellfish mixed fiber clothing without fear proper smiting. isn’t good enough spammed Sure let’s real. mask doesn’t change much. Facists like Trump Xi much bigger danger Yes course. one really want risk death. community unsafe, people stay away. makes easy tell glance stupid asshole isn't. would work well providing infinite huge resources. 2021 criticizing focusing quality masks worn - whether one worn Dude half comments Trump snowflakes.Are okay? Blaming villifying individuals spread viral illness globe simply disgusting. Sounds like dysautonomia me. Mine flares badly viral illness. hope common, considering millions covid. Dysautonomia debilitating.. stay home mom unfamiliar area incredibly hard own, even pandemic. social species, even introverts, realize important even microinteractions work mental health- ""how weekend?"", ""thanks"" help coworker, eye contact knowing glance around meeting boss says thing that's become inside joke he/she's around....etc. 
Even satisfaction accomplishment job lacking home kids nothing ever really gets done, kids need EVERYTHING, they're unhappy cry yell several times day, learned appreciative quite yet. 
Then find looking forward root canal 2-3 whole hours one cry need anything first ""me time"" forever. Oh, can't really vent difficult feel lucky get it. 
 
As tell, even though loved it, feel lucky, change thing, struggled years SAHM, moving across country ex's job, end still travel 3 weeks month work. 
So ever like chat, hesitate send message! Although agree wearing masks. attitude comment blind compliance. careful, downside blind compliance- loss liberty, freedom choice.

Masks beneficial, however suggest wear one someone told us, ""just it, there's downside"" slippery slope. yea, that's impression I'm getting. Even though cases increased factor 12-14 since reopened almost 3 months ago, still reporting 100-130 new infections day province 5 million probably panic mode, increase alarming school starts proper monday that's huge concern... That's necessarily true. question moral one: throw people overboard sake majority, say society? Whatever happened principle of: ""women children first""? principle basis reality really matters?

Mind you, saw titanic push came shove, ""women children first"" mere platitude. 0/10 unfunny nonsense   90% people amazing best help around them. It’s groups get huge become abstract concepts actual human beings real vileness comes willing stay home keep people getting sick -and keep mind covid genuinely like flu some, cousin boyfriend it-, seems like pretty major thing do, minor inconvenience, people already ill something else, lost access healthcare due lockdowns? risks health, would motivate take form action? badly harmed medical negligence myself, so, genuine question.

Here UK followed rules government figures said pleased public’s response. “The lockdown far successful expected,” said one cabinet minister, adding people responded much better that, family Christmas cancelled week. No, like dysautonomia. article specifically mentions symptoms ""chest pain gastrointestinal issues cognitive problems debilitating fatigue"" lady work said too. I'm happy found relief use mask fashion regularly way whole covid deal Swedes. dumb people.  good thing told us masks would help start. could've cause lot confusion problems

Garmisch-Partenkirchen currently experiencing violent corona eruption. woman USA apparently blame. 26-year-old woman said toured several bars despite infection.

According authorities, violent corona eruption Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Upper Bavaria, probably largely due young woman enjoys celebrating. least responsible district office convinced this. 26-year-old woman said passed several pubs market town foot Zugspitze various days, infecting numerous people process. superspreader. According authorities, allegedly already symptoms pub crawl waiting results corona test.

**""The lady symptoms, came test station ordered stay quarantine symptoms. that,"" said Stephan Scharf, spokesman district administration office, Saturday. 26-year-old returned shortly vacation Greece.** Whether caught disease trip afterwards Garmisch-Partenkirchen unclear. ""We know caught it,"" says Scharf. corrected previous statement tourist arrived USA. ""transmission problem"" within authority. **The woman American, lived community tourist.**

""There often cases people wait test results,"" said Scharf. ""And nationality really matter. wanted many people possible come forward remember contact woman pub last days.

Because contact persons could traced far, health authority asking local bars evening report hotline health authority (08821/ 751-500) tested. call aimed primarily young people ages 18 35 may infected encouraged get tested.

In accommodation, woman works, according Scharfs far 24 humans tested positively. total number new infections Saturday 37, seven-day incidence 54, critical mark 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants seven days. ""Of course, must contracted disease,"" emphasizes Scharf. 453 positive cases detected district since beginning corona crisis.

Sorry, there's evidence [switch using cowpox virus horsepox virus, later became known vaccinia virus, See also [the DNA analysis one old Americans refuse shut think right. Every single American dreams outspoken opinions fight whole world know ur right. want nail sticks trying hammer confirmation right.

For Americans attitude manifests shamelessly screaming nonsense others manifests screaming throughout bourgeoisie. love idea fight what’s right Actually fairly early on. way mass media reported news twisted get much recognition, I'll try anyway.

I come Bulgaria people keeping precautions since start. end May people started living normal, precautions all. 100 people infected per day 5000 tests. Deaths since start around 715.
I mean Bulgaria country much less people it, still people literally never kept precautions nothing really happening like predicted - people would die, would spread quickly on.

You understand this, Bulgaria corruption everywhere, even kept normal people secret much. People know, since *lots* normal people offered money (decent Bulgaria) saying got infected stay hospital accepting relatives counted died unknown called Corona virus. (I know 4 people)

By saying want say countries peoples react differently viruses. crazy read stuff subreddit, I'd take precautions keep people healthy, that's before, sick go near old people people suffer that.

Just giving different perspective whole negative trend going here. DATA BACKING THEORY. “For remember, variolation process old days taking someone smallpox actually taking postule smallpox inject basically scratch arm putting person person's arm getting mild case smallpox. inhaled. big dose got there. people still died this, many protected severe form smallpox. Well, paper Monica Gandhi George Rutherford basically whole series kind ifs, ifs, ifs.
 
Michael Osterholm [00:22:51] hypothesized was, wore face cloth covering, called mask, really define talking about, lesser dose inhaled virus mild asymptomatic disease, developed protection. there's lick data supports concept all. reason I'm concerned that, fact, read hear someone, would say, well, know what? I'm gonna go public face cloth covered I'm going distance.
 
Michael Osterholm [00:23:28] I'm going go right everybody, might tonight might lucky night get infected mild virus level therefore I'm protected. dangerous make point. would say, short, we've gone length. make statements lower dose. clue they're talking about. There's dosage data here. “

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Uh-oh. never said 50% vaccine cuts chance 50%, said social distancing may still needed even vaccine discovery I'd rather people cold flu symptoms get tested. That's resources going. People wear it, properly enforced socially encouraged. It’s rocket science. Yeah quip des informed Americans, usual know understand shit themselves. Foxnews saying something could definitely help.

Really sorry brother :( That's actually really interesting idea, makes sense me. Never thought terms small viral load before. important note: false negatives way likely beginning end disease. right get retested. OP's family visited gets tested right party, may show negative, quite clear yet.

If symptoms appear, waiting days get tested exposure annoying, probably prudent.  Wearing mask ordering take months totally absurd reason say “this existence isn’t worth living in”. give infinite number typewriters infinite number them. They'll write every possible academic paper eventually. divert attention actual culprits. Imagine huge fines wouldn’t deter people breaking law. Recently guy got first fine breaking self isolation, 485$ it’s huge fine it’s enough cause discomfort. much idiot.. 10k enough make realize can’t anything want. Loans anyone? husband getting food restaurants curbside pick up. Zero interest restaurant people even minutes takes pick food.

Yeah, really bother long AC on. bother taking know I'm going put right back soon. needs top comment. need quarantine 14 days after. mean, mass production already happening, dont see would take end year start distribution know said dick,

“...but I’m going totally ignore one.”

What point comment? Shaming someone hard time isolating half year? year pretty damn unprecedented many lifetimes, shaming anyone effects takes mental health weak hell. principal School quit 3 years ago (left teaching altogether 2 years never looked back since) constantly posting open teacher positions substitute teaching requests facebook laugh time. go remote already. failed experiment trying campus classes caused h damage online classes Fall. laws still planning going Arizona winter. think safe weak people already gotten sick. We've told die we're wasting money shipping bodies home. mean constantly gasping breath suffocating breathing CO2?! Russian money.

Sit RV mask on? actually suggest Disney? Best time get rid unsustainable industries live luxury consumption firstworlders ruin planet everyone. look unemployed government blaming telling get jobs. Even though shut downs caused massive job loss many businesses aren’t hiring many people back, many shut indefinitely, many went business completely, way less jobs shut down. Many people middle class too. People used savings starting face homelessness. government clutching pocketbook suddenly money conscious giving millions bailouts corporations. It’s insane. another stimulus prevents another Great Depression would rather take pay back taxes future economy stabilized against. depression would cause much worse longer lasting damage. It’s insane government sit idly by. Lmao dude Reddit equivalent “have tried happy?” I’m trying. I’m still miserable. No, they’ll drive home free healthcare bring virus back Canada positions suddenly became unessential teachers home. Similar reason middle management pushing bring people back offices. UK limit 6 person gatherings starts Monday. current limit party held 30, ~50.

From article:

*”Under current rules issue fines anyone hosting gatherings 30 people result fines £10,000. eve rules becoming even tighter gatherings six.”* many house parties neighborhood Labor Day weekend, feel like whole neighborhood super spreading event. mean, really? People done. virus give fuck though. nowhere near done us. selfishness displayed people astonishing. friend Europe says things pretty bad again, nobody cares. guess everyone says ""meh, there's cases one's dying"". I'm telling saw exact thing summer. started young people simply took time get vulnerable population. takes time vulnerable succumb disease. Europe US again.

Edit: I'm getting downvotes guess add people still care. According there's growing sentiment done mitigation, appetite another lockdown. They're large protests mitigation like US, saying things similar people said cases spiked. Like, people actually stormed reichstag week.  they're smart enough figure mask usage viral spread routes, definitely stay home, fully agree!  50 people? Melbourne it'll $80k AUD (1.6k/person). Lucky make ugly sound beautiful Lol Europe benefit seeing happened US even saying stupid are. 

Then Europe follows right along! Congrats!  True confusing beginning, willing forgive confusion fucked time nobody really knew going time, even smart people making good guesses. I’m still server people like still fucking trash. already several vaccines proven effective. effective safe tens thousands people leading ones testing now. know reputable expert doubts vaccines next year. 10th deaths per capita nothing brag about.  really. said nice words like DT medical staff PPE, Rudy failed properly support first responders properly working radio equipment. big mouth though. speech right explaining lockdown. mostly lie, businesses continue operate normally. Moderna even Pfizer terms timeline spent 10 years researching developing mRNA vaccines. random company popped covid hit- established before. another one happened develop MERS vaccine unable test, led quicker development covid vaccine.

In short, vaccine they're testing actually result years work. Moderna Dr. Fauci lied American people too. saying Dr. Fauci wrong too? likely cold outside tent November. would need see doctor? People snap back normal lives disrupted much. Sometimes things happen. cant control it. Shit happens. matters respond it. Try make best rather getting hung lamenting it. still things safe socially distance wear mask. Things happen outside control things shouldnt think much about. despite it. Outbreak, 24/7 also important note pre existing conditions comorbidities used interchangeably arent always same. Someone preexisting conditions could high blood pressure listed comorbidity condition result covid.   Well there's ton old movies many others would pay see big screen.

But I'll wait till corona thing blows go. That's word person originally reply using. 

Basically, saying waves inevitable. SOmeone challenged Korea, said still wave (it barely anybody). 

It's misinformation try say inevitable imply can't stop protective measures, wrong irresponsible, imo. mean “life SEVERE hiatus,” exactly would work? decides works? No, taking vaccine “approved” CCP. Fuck. That. I'm grateful parents apparently smarter are, they're staying home year. Ok. Happy wrong right side things. 

We remember cases (blue bars) actually caught March April probably small fraction compared actual cases. graph gives us negative picture today’s situation. 

How people general Spain feel development? Scary hell, pretty cool it? somewhere between? Looking people directly eye talking even sitting almost superpower. you’ll find people like well. can’t stare, needs feel natural, they’ll find trustworthy, honest, they’ll feel closer you. People don’t tend look others eyes don’t like.

I naturally (I think it’s raised family) usually get along everyone make friends easily. read studies it, suddenly understood why. people aren’t listening now, cycle continues.  Sadly unemployed can’t get back normal government trying pull old “y’all need get job!” Instead helping, ignoring fact way less jobs start pandemic, many fields completely shit severely scaled back, many employers afraid hiring things may shit again.  There's zero risk long use public transport kind wear high quality mask they're close people. Simple precautions eliminate risk completely. would unsatisfying passively watch us destroy without playing part it. would feel like earned it. instead posh student local, would definitely 'man'  Less 2 months since recovery. need say reinfection relapse. 6 weeks norm reinfections.  sets awful precedent. Would apply every contagious disease? kind country live BLM protests Vancouver pretty good wearing masks, thought unusual almost nobody wears masks grocery stores much higher risk. hand, poverty/homelessness/native protests virtually masks. Obviously anti-mask protests masks. Really depends organizers think. Sorry, thought article said well enough, broadly: probably means they're getting higher viral loads, average, would fit mask use low. Higher loads means people get die, higher death rate.

Most data confirming low load often creates low symptoms (or even legendary asymptomatic carriers), confers immunity without much suffering, high load leads hospitalization death.

So like article says, masks prevent virus completely, reduce load get, mean cases fewer serious ones, fewer deaths.

It fit together, words. stupid colleges dont care virus, students come live dorms go person classes infect others. 
But cares right? school gets money, since college aged kids survive numbers wont look bad. Plus shift blame school lack safety commonsense blame young kids one remember facilitated whole thing. Movie theaters known that. fucken stupid country even say wave post still harping word. understand ""Canadian Snowbird"" is? 

Elderly people, squarely likely die ""if catch thing"" risk group.

Why risk all? went bar last night packed. Watch post history see die. 2022 read article choice stop party get fine.... Like, problem term “normal” take multiple meanings minds.

I assume sort gradual return normal. Fauci means summer 2021 return office, go restaurant/bar, attend wedding indoors - general longer social distance / wear mask *but* large 50,000 concerts, sporting events, clubs late 2021? That’s fine. live that. That’s like, 90% “normal” me.

If means we’re we’re (social distancing, keeping 10 person bubble, mandatory working home orders) end 2021 I’ll pretty disappointed. afford another lockdown. 

“The cost policy high”. No, isn’t. “Too much economic damage”. Congress didn’t fully fund businesses pay workers salaries. “Government debt accumulated already”. joke? America owns currency. make debt basically disappear.

“Lockdowns policy poor track record”. Tell Europe cases go down, America it’s control. 

So smarter vast majority Virologists Epidemiologists? mean end like every virus?

Flu shots protect specific strains flu.

Flu shots also trigger immune responses essentially feels like flu.

Very little actually known covid works / does. today reading linked interrupting autonomous systems like breathing digestion causes health problems would necessarily symptoms popularly known started wearing bandana work February. work entertainment, everyone thought nuts. guy come say, “we’re point eh?” joke, shrugged said, “It can’t hurt.” lied: held five rallies. sometimes forget I’m wearing mask. car... Tons people UK already virus thus immune anyway. Wait till next week...

Then three weeks later case explosion raise like years. Grocery store meat tastes gross. get wrong, there's argument deterrence less magnitude punishment certainty punishment.

But case, there's huge benefit publicity fine brings. People need know consequences themselves, since altruism evidently strong enough argument all.

Now, enforcement aggressive. could save lot lives money. Lmao shit, don’t say? one argues marches protests absolutely spread virus, argue closed doors partying spreads way easily outdoor protests. 

and issues important enough warrant risk increase (especially electon year). 

a pandemic democracy zero sum game. sometimes weight decisions. 


you point basically:""I dont care might die tomorrow cop bad day, protest might get ill could possibly die"" [the IFR people 50 CDC website itself.

So exactly young healthy allowed resume normal life? protecting actually vulnerable instead? Viral load would falling immune system gets control lease? so, get decide stays property doesn't.

Reheat want, makes feel comfortable. people know disease actually spread focus precautions address actual means infection rather arbitrary ways disease spread. Nah man, people wear masks basement dwellers people wear condoms lonely virgins US taking turn outside corner. busy years went rushing us. lost starry notions way 
If chance I'd see tavern. We'd smile one another we'd say .... came say practiced Asia long even Romans. guys dealing plagues lot longer. Case numbers one metric revealing current level community spread. cohort currently highest infection rate 20-40 age range, level community spread indicates unsafe higher risk bad outcomes. common cold: Oh research wrong? people thumbing actually want significant heart damage coronavirus? Oh look, another pissing contest. would take pus open wound small pox patient, put pin head poke arms yet it.

Amazing think someone back thought might work, understanding viruses existed. perhaps noticed people mildly exposed suffered cuts exposed sick people get sick themselves? agree! Variolation tried, tested, true. idea smaller viral load given touch credence. UK dropped ball right start opportunity prepare inevitable. look Italy see coming, - blind arrogance/stupidity led tens thousands avoidable deaths near overwhelmed NHS. months later, people seem forgotten devastating many people across country. Anyone happy multitude die keep going pub keep Pret afloat must lack empathy - see explanation it. genuinely worries callous people country are. actually *believed* that? knew nothing vaccines work. good finally coming around. assure you, not.
It's mandatory everywhere closed opens spaces cities ppl possibility wear almost everything (bicycle, sport, sigarette, coffe, eating, bar, restaurant, banana, etc) end I'm within 20% wearing street behavior usually this: I'm alone street, usefulness wearing mask really low wear mask, meet friends wear mask kiss talk without hour, moreover controls fines (even technically be). Pub disco restaurants everything open inside nobody wear mask even often waiters. So... yes, officially masks mandatory reality complete mess. mention CoVID vascular effects too. Look get it. think politics involved extent. think hospitals everything get additional covid death money etc. honestly think X% people destine get virus whatever reason that’s states major hotspots earlier seem trending right direction. 

But said cannot explain away excess death rate baseline we’ve since March. cannot explain away masks work Asia. cannot explain away real shutdowns (not Americans version) worked many places especially places like Italy. 

I don’t know answers. know wearing mask inside can’t keep away seems something pretty simple lower chance death vulnerable loved ones it’s worth inconvenience. Mask can't give immunity that's mask work stop exposed virus. here’s question - anyone else felt little “off” pandemic, didn’t get sick? There’s instances throughout I’ve either gone grocery store rare occasion I’ve travel something next week (whether head not) get worse usual allergies, feel warm usual temp, back pain, etc. 

After reading this, often wonder I’ve come contact it, small load that’s body fighting Apparently typical viruses transferred new species host.

That shows nothing al, whatsoever.

""Typical"" irrelevant. evidence anything something typical not. Ugh, mom similar. always big whole positive thinking shit far back high school, remember breaking someone tried introduce Secret. younger stupid, tried realized bullshit. Now, almost decade later, comes telling ""369"" Method write thing realize dreams saw was. offended huffed said it.

I know, needlessly optimistic dummy high school even back learned denial trying hard spin shit situation something superficially positive. painful see nearly 50 year old woman trying delude herself. makes unavailable anyone else needs support. 

And worse, family members say I'm ""too negative"" I'm realistic. yea, pretty isolating people want head sand. donated N95 masks learned local shortage. Healthcare workers one apeice autoclaving reuse, figured 20 would lot good me. true. also wonder many people legitimately mentally ill. means people wasting breath trying explain reality. Nightingale hospitals

They converted cancer testing centres help backlog remain standby covid. sure US.

But UK someone get COVID, recover, die three months later unrelated condition.

They still counted COVID death. Hmmmm. 

More people die *directly* flu yet accept people get move lives.

COVID simply deadly first feared. figures massaged country make appear deadly is. fact.

Now take article. Look use ""might"", ""may"", ""could"", etc. Yet everybody treating fact. Like top comment! insanity. Regardless party lines complete mismanagement. country recover decades. unlikely undetected long time humans mutated traces.

No not. wrong. could going remote region without doctors, scientists such. poor mountain villages.

You jump conclusion originated 5 minutes 1st cases spotted. basis all. could going decades isolated Lab discovered virus 96 percent identical COVID-19 coronavirus 2013 mineshaft soon three miners working died COVID-like illness. WIV didn’t share findings 2020.

96% what? shows exist viruses similar Sars-Cov-2 exactly would expect.

It prooves 96% one miners anything whatsoever genetically sequencing mine virus 2017 2018, analyzing way done past viruses preparation running experiments them

So what? surprising virus research mentioned article, lab 2 prior SARS accidental leaks.

So zero evidence virus anything lab all?  must missing something. saw 1 link metro paper, exactly known hard hitting journalism.

These relevant links original right, source. antidotal, fact live China know hundreds people hubei, understand count evidence one thing I've learnt last 9 months much complete shit Western news publishes China.

Sorry, believing whole world came conspire China naive. think filmed videos? learn western media, reddit r/coronavirus even active sub again, reading r/China_flu great switch. People posted many videos China, archived wechat messages, pleas help. used overwhelming amount Chinese citizens posting China began [cracking Coronavirus sure said many times news can't trusted, yet choose believe must true China.

Absolutely not, blindly trust news China. propaganda easy see, authoritarian government passed Tiananmen square bunch rebellious troublemakers, Falun Gong cult deserved organs confiscated sold, forced Uyghur reeducation camps way combat terrorism, welding people homes way deal quarantine breakers, government given benefit doubt. Nah plenty regular folks trying buy several months worth time too. Maybe technically hoarding every Karen Chad extra 12-pack normal purchase added People miss point. society can’t even decide illness real not. even bigger problem, aren’t focusing it. Instead care president going be, cops criminals drama. 

We physically emotionally feel world could heaven hell. Right don’t look far see people hate, scream, beat, kill aren’t far hell guys. surprising shame. glad we’re virtual district now. Stupids stupiding. Billions, trillions maybe is. running President?  put dog July vet would let one us stay room time. sad, weeks prior let family room euthanasia. thats mask work mask giving people immunity thing could potentially reduce amount virus exposed to. create immunity title hot garbage. first wave peaked 14 weeks ago. second wave. care much cases people aren’t getting sick? We’ve redefined means ill confirm narrative arguing good faith. posted thread comment insinuating death whatsoever (a car crash) would counted Covid death reporting numbers. Thats right claiming virus fake hoax. Shame you. fyi vaccination need wait effective heading immediately movies  Unfortunately people charge withholding federal funds side deniers, sane side. Hitlery Channel lot good programming. Youre calling stupid never learned 3rd grade something called ""Hyperbole"".

Let simplify you, sweety.


noun

exaggerated statements claims meant taken literally.

""he vowed revenge oaths hyperboles""

😘 Yeah that's terrible. I'm sure point posting though. going try say old people die home New York lombardy. many tragedies shitty virus around world. Yikes. name documentary? I've gone bit nuts buying masks fun two kids wear - let assure Hello Kitty masks aplenty available Etsy. it! Raising kid hard enough, anything saves time energy welcomed opened arms, including disposable diapers bottom third states deaths per capita per matter? That's told reasonable species. Instead, rushed toilet paper hand sanitizer like primates people started price gouging. 

At point, can't blame anyone telling public truth even though wish did. They’ve pretty much said additional stimulus check parties can’t agree bill. It’s tragic miss words ""might"" ""may""?! 

It's unproven hypothesis yet literally treating fact. Poor baby. victim. people upvoted brain dead morons. primarily funded US primarily staffed Americans. Essentially created US. Funny every country also got head-start virus discovered someone else get ""set up"" including countries lot geographical closer apparent source.

In case, SG told people wear masks wanted make sure doctors could get them. Makes sense. Masks work buy them, masks work need doctors. Funny around time administration ceasing states PPE shipments sending butt buddies Israel despite export bans. fact morons can't even see absolute outrage corrupt evil government non-handling situation testament thoroughly system social controls works keep morons brainwashed clueless. things :

- million people tested every week thousands tested previous peak. definitely pumped numbers up. 

- Private meetings friends families almost back normal (no mask etc..) even though people respect sanitary rules public places, much families friends. 

- time we’re far away April’s numbers comes hospitalizations. kind good news yes virus increasingly circulating territory far put much stress hospitals medical facilities. 

The easy conclusion new situation would state 2nd wave started ”under control” far due fact good testing capacity people affected young ones theory recover easily virus. However week government started voice concerns wouldn’t surprised see restrictions coming next weeks. honestly think schools. chilly mornings hot afternoons people getting ""regular"" sick since covid make kids get tested adults scared get tested resulting higher numbers. saying schools noticed big increase positives opened. half planet dead according them? cares cases one dying? hear yourself?  That’s studies time showed true. still know masks really help beyond lab setting. 

Mask wearing Wild different thing mask studies. serve us well future traumatized children become angry adults. still military members. still smallpox scar it. Sucked waiting heal. go gym go swimming. Absolutely covered except showering. Source? think I’ll err side caution sure :) Sometimes feel like people sub live entirely different reality. 

Like, live? America almost every country world completely stopped paying attention Covid. cases still spread, one paying attention. lack movie theaters people masks, world exactly pre-Covid since May. vascular disease though, realize later. realize spreading aerosol either later. They're still debating transmits. agree though, mask mandates introduced immediately. think scientists sometimes hesitant make decisions due polarized people be. didn’t studies showed was. That’s crazy thing science . think something makes sense mean true.

The fact large proponent public wearing masks improperly, touching constantly washing them.....

So benefit get mask wearing may negated. studied yet. *can* things. chooses to. That's totally irrelevant. 

The reseach bat caves done China. US funding matters here.

China allow anybody outside research bat viruses while. allow it, monitor do, kick find something possibly makes China look bad.

They want control avoid PR damage.

So research themselves, info turns cause virus OK PR.

It came bat - matters much particular group bats came guy first get got contact bat? 

It's like anything done prevent future anyway. 

We know decades could happen, nothing. That's is. 

Humans stupid, short sighted lazy, slack preventing future accidents. goes viruses also many, many possible disasters.

Scientists also warning asteroid impacts instance. One could obliterate New York tomorrow. 

We could stuff make sure could happen, lazy want spend money preventing disasters, prefer chance out. Florida isn’t even top 15 deaths per million per Same. one two people market wearing mask quite while... interesting watch slowly changed mask minority mask majority. 

We lucky boxes masks hand due partner working cars- standard shelf item garage. Tell South Korea wsy better us first case day us. right way wrong way wrong possible. No, corona gone away everything right, would crazy outbreaks like now. could like nations 10 new cases day scary, instead getting desensitized hundreds thousands cases day.

FFS, look Canada behold failed. 1/10th population that's fair, multiple everything 10 utterly blowing cases deaths.

We fucked entirely trump's fault encouraging people take seriously. go herd immunity really one series sob stories know virus serious. People take support precautions people deserve sad articles. bad. number infected people increases actively testing (1 million tests per week 70 million population). One month ago would test people confirm cases Covid-19 probable outcome. 

This gives us chance isolating people tested positive, provide medical treatment early. matters really health system still overwhelmed patients, economy stopped like March - April. 

Masks mandatory closed areas (stores, offices, transportation) even people comply fully, effective slowing spread. problems comes young people social events without observing safety rules contaminating older people get severe forms covid-19. * Original SARs sequence mutated frequently immediately jumping animal humans. one didn't.

 mentioned article, lab 2 prior SARS accidental leaks.

 Bots going down-vote post comments... cares case numbers more. Whats situation hospitals?  Doesn’t affect me. always hated them. Actually bighest hurdle simply producing distributing enough vaccines confusing messaging. 
You mean lies. lied us. Consider moving Sweden, lowest spread amongst European nations signs second wave. travel cross-county couple weeks ago, Colorado Missouri.

The farther go city, less people wore masks. NOBODY wearing masks going across Kansas; couple gas stations signs ignored. masks see chin.

The ""wear mask"" thing across much America seems observed exception writ.  Flatten curve delays covid deaths gives hospitals time get ready. still get deaths want denote sarcasm via text without /s, *really* gotta sell it. almost like little puzzle. ""What word put juuust enough, much?""  mid-August, Denmark 14,959 cases 107 deaths/million; Norway 9,712 cases 47 deaths/million; Finland 7,623 60 deaths/million; Sweden 83,126 cases 571 deaths/million. sound like handled things better neighboring Nordic states certainly reached herd immunity. could find virus circulating bats start, Trump pulled funding American research program bat viruses. that. second paragraph article literally says, ""unproven theory"". Wuh? estimated situation May first national serosurvey done. time testing limited. estimated catching 1 10 20 cases now.

We nowhere near 40% infection rate based current figures. 40% cases would declined lot. Based calculation around 13% whole country now. 
Urban India 20% rural India around 8% far. people assuming I'm concerned *retinal* damage? You... know cataract is?

Well that's exactly it. cataract damage lens eye, deeper structure I'm talking about.

I'm worried something called [climatic droplet affects corneal stroma.

That's really shallow layer eye needs transparent let light well. CDK, translucent *something* accumulates layer, bad. 

The disease process completely understood - cloudy stuff probably damaged protein. CDK *is* associated UV exposure.

And corneal stroma really close air. There's 3 micrometers tear film, 50 micrometers corneal epithelium, stroma.

The tear layer resistant damage, epithelium vulnerable, long-term effects stroma (CDK) unknown.

Actually, UV-C barely studied rare nature people encounter unless intentionally generate it. Even welding-arc accidents UV-B dose. current practice UV-C lamps ""lock people control lamps remotely,"" know [accidents hurt No, probably Russian  Great masks cause autism Well since opinion piece basically same.thing uncle. 

No scientific proof article. guess upvotes everything soon discovered spread air, would anyone think masks help. actually understand stupidity poorly worn cloth masks. actually little protection. help ways. 
Everyone wearing properly fitted effective masks. research long time. I've woodworking wood dust bigger viruses guess buy better N95, cause protect enough. Evidence assertions makeing things up? Yeah, testing 25k people daily population around 0.22 billion people, whereas India testing million per day population 1.38 billion people.

Less tests = less cases omg virus defeated Wrong place post although you’re totally correct.  sub renamed r/permalockdown ...so masks cause autism! /s peak time US. Pre 9/11, booming economy, internet take like rocket ship. great time American. Applesauce manage itself! wild headline, even know respond it. problem, however, people think getting vaccinated means immediately return normal. That's vaccines work, Fauci pointed out. Fauci right.

Sadly, see even fellow members sub succumbing kind magical thinking. look around megathreads see mean. know, comments like:

* can't *wait* get vaccine watch movies again! (Don't forget social distance wear masks! like right now!)
* *absolutely confident* everything return normal March 2021, that's lockdown started! (Data determines dates, calendar. virus still spreading Christmas—and probably be—, celebrate Christmas year.)
* There's *no* way governments keep everyone line one *more* year. Everyone go back normal, including me! (We'll, government *wants* that, to, to.)

And forth. Ugh, one people, *please* reconsider mindset. optimistic winter spike arrives! One says Trump tell say. Sorry meant say days. wave bother, op covid denier absolute loon bother looking post history Everyone dies heart stopping idea exercise estimation borne rereading paper.  repeatedly uses phrase ""we find""  ""we conclude""

One quote captures tone "" conclude Sturgis Motorcycle Rally generated substantial public health costs, calculate reach least $12.2 billion using statistical value COVID-19 case estimated Kniesner Sullivan (2020). ""

And nowhere conclusions section indicate way estimates could high significant factor.

No call anyone bad person, explicitly.  assign alleged 12 billion dollar ""externallity"" collectively attendees calculation per capita cost due attendence. Oh yeah know not. many people know back March saw something would end fall year telling ""normal"" begin late 2021 it'll new normal shock highlighting shitty old normal was. fucking clue you’re talking clearly reading sensationalist headlines, please shut fuck up. husband deleted FB exact reason back late April May. Life better without it. also little surprised really none friends family (even state live FL) reached see we're ok dropped face earth. Oh well. Lol it’s funny ignore basic math propagate narrative, it’s cases per million already normalizes population silly Maybe argue someone dies understand death certificates work, people home.inside exercise up, can't argue total deaths. COVID account rise deaths causing them? anomalous warrants explanation.  respects reintroduce limits case numbers go up. Germany said even limit 50/100,000 per week reached, going move finger hospitals overrun crisis. Good countries take proper measures spread. ..well yeah course... Well, experts discovered, people don’t well decisions based delayed outcomes / consequences. 

Lots Brits didn’t really think long-term consequences, especially changing circumstance (a pandemic, say) Brexit might have.

The pandemic. They’re sick it; want crowd back pubs without masks. choice many could jeopardize kids’ schooling future point beyond moment — “Quit scare mongering! We’ll never need lock again!”

It’s Brit thing: it’s human thing. people actually think hoax. also required isolate indefinite amount time. I'm sure got idea. 911 radio cop? mean operator? Decades inaction rightward shift Overton window accompanied decades education defunded brain drain leading anyone substantially intelligent left even Obama. helps decades inaction exists public wellbeing right wing side government building ignore eyes ears believe say Sean Hannity. 

It's pretty clear got honestly that's really sucks. Zero percent right. ‘Variolation’ actually archaic term Edward Jenner days, doctors scientists use ‘inoculation’ ‘vaccination’ Sweden need compared neighboring countries others?

Nobody forcing people out. contrary, attempting force us in. 


Edit: answers, though people clearly reading. reveals lot!  There's shortagrs masks right though. Even sanitizer generally available.  problem would March. tried chiropractor desperation once... 

Had maybe five neck adjustments suddenly started getting “complex” migraines. ended ER doctors prepping lumbar puncture check blood CSF symptoms superficially identical subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Don’t go chiro, guys. Peeps Easter only. knew physical barrier droplets filled virus would decrease viral load beneficial! SURPRISE  people intentionally put others risk (like coughing people ""protests"" flash mobbing masks"" terrorists, inciting violent intimidation political motives. Still nobody expected die vaccine administered 30k cases. check math see better life expectancy get it. school 2 days fuck Ridiculous, right? there’s bullshit spreading around breastfeeding causes cavities. straight article linked model live. updated regularly. never meant interpreted comprehensive prediction future. intended planning tool help policymakers, hospital officials public plan ahead. fact, people made model hope projections present wrong — revised downward reducing number people infections staying home, help medical system,” Mokdad told me. “And peak comes, shortage projecting big seeing right social-distancing working.”


The models offer different outcomes like hurricane tracking. 


The models hate always worst case scenarios, best case scenarios stuff in-between. depends governments handle it. public responds. lockdowns? public following them? Mask? Concerts? Bars open? Packed sports arenas?


Yeah, local news probably wanted make everyone aware could happen one gave shit. qualitative test — it’s positive negative,” said Sara Vetter, interim assistant division director Minnesota’s public health laboratory, processed 60,000 COVID-19 tests.

It's virus like others. zero proof natural.

Every single argument lab origin like ""there meteor craters area, meteors never hit naturally! means aliens"" think it, there's nothing odd area getting one meteor crater.

Take argument good measure, almost passing, Chan pointed detail one else noticed: COVID-19 contains uncommon genetic sequence used genetic engineers past insert genes coronaviruses without leaving trace, falls exact point would allow experimenters swap different genetic parts change infectivity. sequence occur naturally coronavirus, irrefutable proof unnatural origin, Chan explained, “only observation.”

Perhaps effort expense could put instead towards concentrated effort finding non-animal test subjects. US, UK, Spain, Italy locked varying degrees, rather strictly, higher deaths per million Sweden.

/s virus loves cold. We'll see who's right.  lack empathy basic understanding 

How hard wrap head around? largest chunk deaths coming nursing homes long term care facilities (40% total). 70%+ deaths coming 60 nearly 2/3rds deaths coming 80 year olds older.

Senate refused discuss it, much less vote it. ridiculous blame house this. could explain seeing different curve cases death rate, though likely answer testing expanded asymptomatic cases caught Yep! broke engagement weeks ago exact thing. I'm immunocompromised really wanted go get drunk coworker's birthday. told could I'd locking house two weeks. One thing led another saved $15,000 wedding next year. pointless data, countries go waves different times. substantive response anything else youve posted. One thing, actually give microdoses smallpox, gave microdoses cowpox.

When comes getting virus, less infective particles get, better, get enough particles get infected immune system gets sneak-a-peek virus better prepared.

This good news story except get infected, still pass high doses infective virus particles household contacts unless wear mask around house time. got back, nosleepy. saw millenial_bots comment history too. anti-masker hypocritically karma whoring 8 updoots persecuted wearing mask. Comment history hit list: ""People understand flu"", ""I wear muzzle(mask)"", ""Covid spread govt 5G"", call Fauci fake doctor good measure. Keep away 737 Max. #BoeingBurn Especially assholes big trucks inundated covid calls? People don’t die lockdown, die lockdown.  Look low bar is. People praised wearing masks *deadly global* pandemic. really can't wait Karen meme die.. New Mexico here. governor push masks pretty early on. one states best despite stuck tx az. broke engagement three weeks ago someone thought knew jumped ""virus flu"" train wanted go bar birthday party.

I'm immunocompromised. someone willing risk life bunch froofy cocktails want marry them. also starting spout lot nationalist talking points nowhere.

Really glad waited get married, deal everything goes divorce.  [Bananas Wait, mean say wearing mask actually, beneficial? That's amazing! thought sooner. /s yep.We never know know deadly covid would could bad..so good public health..they said masks dont work. making sure military say health providers got due lower demand. case widespread deadly thing..

Or know, fair, one knew health care would hard I'm California see people without masks looking window. There's bus stop earlier today counted five riders without masks. 1) science 2) truth stupid. horrible things failure federal level down...

I pray (am atheist) salvation.

All small things going add decimate USA.

&amp;nbsp;

If people wanted know it'll take reach herd immunity... Well going empirical case quoted microbiology textbooks future.  could marketed MAGA mask. would saved lives made millions. super genius businessman not. something working must something already doing... part normal lives. see couple hundred million people could suddenly change habit. India situation different yet many similarities, genes, food, poverty population density. anything, poverty greater Pakistan. Yup, like 50 still blaming parents everything. We've months new info rules since people learning cdc's fault. “A mask person”? Lol, it’s smart watch brand sneakers! Yeah, I’m “want get novel virus unclear long term effects” person.. Sooo kind mask talking here? N95... surgical... cloth...? make difference. I’d think N95 wouldn’t expose all, right?  Exactly. “There important things living.” -Dan “die Dow” Patrick Gotta love people pull masks talk work. know plenty people 60 still suffering effects viral infection. die mean can't tax organs cause problems like heart inflammation lung scarring. 

It definitely affects people ages, mortality rate higher elderly. 

And FWIW know someone died 46 fairly good health. virus spreads fast, even low mortality rate, people ages suffer die. kinda goal. can‘t get rid covid, especially fast enough
You can, however, take precautions like wearing mask increase odds mild case completely agree, might explained well enough. initial lockdown saw world absolutely needed. slow initial spread, buy time get testing ramped get health care speed. huge hit economically, necessary prevent massive issues later on.

What seeing though people conflating initial response response thinking nothing proposition. people's fault morons media's fault blowing discussion paper questionable methodology proportion? article brings pretty good point everyone would well remember - every model complex problem necessarily simplified. reject use models science never possibly consider variables? still provide us useful information, even results never entirely correct. lot cases likely happened result Sturgis. statement never proven disproven definitively. study purports know many people infected result large event, especially second third order infections, read healthy dose skepticism. used PPE, information PPE adequate used properly Really depends timing. takes couple days someone exposed spread someone. would take least 4 days get person B C, that's start day contagious. pointed friends stupid logic super early. Might well wear seat belt might encourage reckless driving! I’m sorry loss. experienced thing relative life-long smoker. Seeing struggling breathe hospice horrible. It’s refuse eat indoors much anything right now. Always  hundreds studies proving facemasks work medical literature. influenza 1920s SARS MERS. Nature reviews good starting points. also wash blankets week look gross =). Jesus Christ. Get dude. worth it. Friend, family, anywhere there. good mental health. Good luck. COVID = litmus test selfishness. "" totally normal reasonable response"". Point proven. Didn’t trump recently come implore wacko followers wear masks saying super patriotic? people able wear masks public transportation? analyze severity cases, see public transport cases less severe due mask-wearing? Even catch it, caught mild case recover from, rather serious case. maintain ignorance fault much deception. Health care workers need masks, covid. add reason, negate possibility genuinely ignorant covid spread early days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, one wants admit people internet ahead medical officials TV, really seems case here. Fauci who? Im listening bloke right here. Plenty time passed since then. can't blame CDC current situation. People learn new information unless deliberately obstinate authority going matter. Given vets surgeries, know masks needed lower microbe contamination. wonder infected animals get surgeries. Nah...everyone knows nurses eat young. feel like propaganda make people wear masks  .. ugh  Reason #5785 look like ninja u go out. Hey said he’s intelligent enough “wiegh” choices, enough brainpower left actually interpret them. wish family got tested, caught crazy woman wearing mask walmart. two weeks virus hearts exploded pressure. I'll next...... Shhh, anti morons bad enough own, imagine merged Struggling millenial finally verge moving pandemic, nos hoping stay employed company already laid half employees meantime sitting home fuckall watching friends party go vacations 1100 people arent still dying day. 

The country divided grown despise level regardless election things suddenly get better. trump wins another 4 years reallg hard see future country especially generation yojnger single policy anything future. 

I dont know yall. Shit bad said wear mask couple days *and societally supportive reason so*. Morons wearing masks lied back height idiocy. Almost million deaths world. US, approaching 200 thousand. expected double January. day people dying. missing? stop making looks like nation hypochondriacs even afraid.   could gather reading articles

Perhaps continue research ?  Sweden United States. U.S. much larger popular areas higher population density. People Sweden followed voluntary lockdown recommendations far people U.S. did. Sweden fared better U.S. terms cases deaths, well neighboring countries compulsory lockdowns.

You look areas United States mandatory lockdowns sooner see case/death counts lower areas didn't. also look areas opened soon higher case/death counts areas waited. rocket science. seven conserved replicase domains ORF1ab 94.6% sequence identity amino acids SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV 14, suggesting two viruses might belong species

They call SARS2 reason.

Stop trying spout nonsense SARS2 special. would say vocal minority. 200.000 died covid though, that's official statistic, either saying USA lying international scale stupid Homeschooling parent well, 100% pro vax. lump us crazies ;) Indeed, leadership vacuum biggest problem. ever question? Kids germ factories. They're claimong it. journal article well reasoned argument hypothesis mask wearing might lead acquired immunity. stick lot caveats there. can't take kids with. They're dual citizens, US passport 😞

That's deal breaker.  work around since citizen? would think would be. Packed dry ice? red troll/bot better this. shite. I’m sorry. hope you’re better now. post Covid? 1.6 grams per mile. math fyi, they're still trying hash priority list gets vaccine when. actually different lists, depending type vaccine gets approved targets.  anyway, know vaccine testers get placebo? One things they're hashing much priority given people volunteered testing got placebo. president talking shit like wearing political statement make ""look bad"". base course follow everything, insane people America treating wearing/not wearing masks culture war issue instead public health issue is. never useless always aided ability build antibodies without causing damaging infection. epidemiologist leads Center Infectious Disease Research Policy (CIDRP). weekly podcast COVID informative non-partisan. early voice warning severe things could get continued voice reason throughout pandemic. condemned article shared OP views extremely reckless. correctly points idea expressed article merely hypothesis without actual data support it. believe articles like increase reckless behavior encouraging reliance masks ignoring important factors like physical distancing. Hopefully US finally permanently catch mask culture bidet culture East. *utmost ❤️  actually peer reviewed evidence based research, much well-reasoned hypothesis effects mask wearing rates acquired immunity. actually pretty simple argument follow feel free read see issues happened regardless. there’s hundreds mask distributors home made masks.  Well, competent actions undermined subverted top, kinda hard get grip things. 


And there's pig-stupidity 'MurriKKKans can't put fucking piece fabric face. 200.000 extremely inflated number buddy, everyone died recently died Covid, even close reader might like Pox Americana. read tibit there. book small pox epidemic stretched across U.S. Mexico late 1700's. pretty fascinating good chunk George Washington's tactics based combating disease pretty sharp disadvantage British forces, already immune.

Here's link publisher's page instead store couple examples. Except American don’t wear masks anyways. Maybe thank LSD! way hell I’d take vaccine dude. China literally currently committing genocide, think give fuck human life?

Comparing US China apples oranges every right skeptical. say ""surgical mask"" talking n95, like one blue masks folds? someone also homeschooled (K-12) relate much last bit. know I'd done without internet. probably saved life... practically knowledge world came YouTube, Wikipedia, video games. ideal had. that's real outlet have... sticks you. You’re getting rid ever, even vaccine. Please start accepting this. cannot expect people keep staying home nearly year. Wear mask social distance. you’re losing people day issues way problem long term. pretty bad neck shoulder pain year. doctor referred physical therapy. spent twenty minutes day several weeks assigned exercises pain decreased 20%. stopped exercises due depression pain returned. lived several months knowing motivate PT, remembering little effect much effort had. Despite misgivings, went chiropractor. worked half hour, pain decreased 80%. went back week later, worked half hour, rest pain alleviated. year ago pain returned beyond occasional twinge. That's people go see chiropractors. Where? It’s declining, least now, United States worldwide great yet? Yes? Expert opinions exist, dude. Sometimes they're invited people studying topic like saying every covid death person. think headline really goes without saying. doesn’t need said. mean, said technically true, completely irreverent previous comment hahahaha Japan. common East Asian cultures, point immigrants still Western countries. guess one tiny silver lining one's gonna look weird decide wear mask public transit (whenever COVID finally controlled) flu cold season. became black hole real quick starting, oh, around January 2017


For us, cesspool crazy since Obama's *first* term around 2010. reason keep keep touch family (thankfully sane). definitely understand people frustrated flip flopping, really wasn’t without reason. There’s also hindsight 20/20 stuff going too. Transparency fact would nice, course never happens. 

But many reasons recommending masks beginning. wasn’t trying slow hoarding supply problems. also didn’t know enough transmits. Wearing mask comes risks transmission, touching contaminated surface touching face adjust mask. necessary figure size virus, transmits, long stays air, long lasts various surfaces, establish massive public education needed since US mask culture, time manufacturing small businesses catch supply paper cloth masks, etc. 

Sure, looking back looks like huge error judgment, probably was. wasn’t simple decision tell people wear masks take back later. could definitely argue bad strategy hurtful strategy. can’t really argue 100% wrong without reason. cares wearing masks then? kinda confusing break up. I’m Air Force shop split 5 sections. corners giant hangar, essentially, maintain equipment dedicated Fighter Squadron base. 18 people section. base pretty big mask wearing could punished UCMJ get caught wearing Squadron leadership above. Things started get really lax around June since nobody getting it. wore mine religiously. would sanitize shit every tool, everything touched. I’d correct people time. course I’m around, they’re pulling nose chin. 1 dude got infected, put quarantine. 2 days later two guys got it. kept trickling work together equipment often. 8 people positive. worked within inches installing heavy shit unit. sweating asses still wore masks. 

Anyway, day shift gone quarantine. yet get sick. I’ve pondering article saying. makes sense. 

Of course, that’s proof anything completely theoretical. it’s pretty interesting. Maskcine  *vaccines

*metals

*I'm

*weigh government stole masks? people still buying houses. also assumes strong lasting immunity infection.

The coronaviruses cause common cold still cause new infections despite circulation decades.   Totally boat you. spouse thankfully alone need see people him. also reject notion I’m selfish looking mental health. keyboard warriors probably aren’t even claim are. Punched calculator looks like that's roundabout 2.0 million deaths current figure, anyone curious. ex wife used work EMS, beyond EMT-Basic, weeks employed dispatch shift supervisor county 911 center. bullshit cultivated too, along entire regional law enforcement presence. Lol? evidence. think harder thing going refrigeration. hospital/pharmacy fridges keep contents like 35-45F. Moderna vaccine needs kept -4F, Pfizer Biontech vaccines need kept -94F.

While fridges maintain temperatures, mobile; could *considered* mobile big. Certainly big enough carry planeloads vaccines in. think even open, bar might open. sucks cause that's friends work... literally wrote one messaged me.

Well wishes much appreciated, wish boyfriend... also dish guy, know feels. Haha. anybody surprised? Spend weekend Ken Burns Civil War documentary PBS interesting problem - normally educated making sound decisions simple finding best scientific opinion time. experts handing wrong advice, really damages public trust people truly know believe, even make best efforts find best/most accurate information.

I right pandemic big deal, *was* right masks. (correctly) figured authorities saying ""masks help"" headline ""masks help please stockpile them"", people would immediately started stockpiling them. able look properties known time (the R0 number mainly) mainly airborne fairly certain masks going short supply soon. could without ever reading words “tidal wave”, “tsunami”, “unprecedented” rest life pandemic. strictly life death scenario, nonsense saved lives 100 nurses / paramedics / emts cost 1000 “civilians”, would worth it.


First responders / nurses / docs force multipliers. One doctor save 100, people, one nurse save x, etc. death toll would likely millions action taken all.

Sweden disagrees Dont tell people /r/nonewnormal hate idea actions wearing mask selfish. He's smart, though. 200.000 people died response? Doctors, scientists, dont need listen them. 🙄 Madness Every day see really good reasons people wear masks. Yet still it. See!?! That's humans. Let's go!!! I’ve seen study pop times now, it’s interesting. isn’t unexpected indoor dining could higher risk thought, prolonged time eating, airflow, wearing masks seated. 

Outdoor dining seems less risky, theory. However, still issue wearing mask seated. 

I really, really hope there’s follow study focused outdoor dining. hate wearing mask look forward day safely stop wearing one public. pisses longer people wear mask longer to. knew respiratory virus 100 years experience knowing masks reduce transmission respiratory viruses hell go face masks useless, hurt, provide immunity? aluminum cans, cans still melted made new ones. Production cans one bottlenecks. 
As plastic containers [plastic recycling big oil correct response lie? Kept hidden probably best terminology yes everywhere likely higher cases reported first surges also gotten better treating this. People still die hopefully lesser percentage we've nine months figure better ways treat people increase survival. it’s anything like place, won’t. always told bar industry recession proof things good people wanna celebrate they’re bad wanna drown sorrows.

But this? idea navigate. I’m almost thankful I’ve designated kitchen people now. Even tho I’m bartender 13 years.

It’s whole new world fun. wish best luck. point you, everyone else around well. Except people would acted way intended. would mass hoarding, even worse already was. No. wear every time we're public. get flu contagious 24 hours develop symptoms. 

What saying like waiting showing measles symptoms get measles vaccine. wait car crash put seat belt. 

60,000 deaths year want wait coughing people put mask on? Jesus fucking christ. There's fucking hope us. used get bad headaches heavy squats. coworkers recommended chiropractor saw stopped getting headaches. I've tested years stop going see headaches eventually come back. stopped working back March started again. worked way back previous weights yet start feel tightness neck. Mileage vary chiropractors guy solid. also anti lockdown think secretly anti mask might go back him.  Maybe big boys girls accept mistake move on.  
The tragedy don’t.    
Months gone since then.    
We plenty evidence masks work countries around world.   
Time get science. isn’t propaganda guys? Oh right, everything doesn’t fit extremely narrow view reality. Same, got used mind all, kinda fun way slightly ""disguised"". science become dead vet 101. South Dakota last week work. different world, lot Trump signs, masks, everything open, everyone thinks hoax. Blew mind much people bury heads sand.

Starting 2 week quarantine.

-3/10, hope never go back. 19 years ago. changed. Oh loathe speak ill Fauci (even though know early advice too). referring CDC WHO. can't find longer official websites, here's article time describing (it's pretty spooky considering happened since written): I'm totally idiots inexplicably perpetuating early gaff far beyond point rational. huge problem objectively worse. But, government officials chosen based expertise trust would right thing. Instead, failed anticipate surge need PPE, encountered partially avoidable shortage, gave public dangerous incorrect advice order cover tracks. truth PPE shortage due selfish hoarders; also largely due administrative incompetence, responded shifting blame people. 

However also agree advice public stop buying medical-grade masks correct time. glanced Asian Middle Eastern neighbors, would seen range currently practiced effective options face covering pose threat PPE supply. personally think reason push purely cultural. see face covering untrustworthy, un-American, close ""the other"" comfort. paid xenophobia lives. Here's article found interesting explores cultural factors around mask wearing: story people thought best time extremely wrong. think they're bad people, think addition pointing fingers hating fellow citizens (who admittedly idiots), also continue demand expect trusted lead us. understand everyone saying “MOVE NOW” you’d unlikely remain awkward situation unless needed to. 

Good making best shitty time. emotionally uncomfortable home still house. nah. get decide deadly pandemic ends.
they get stupid shit make worse. Guess shut em  Well, know initial response epidemic pretty abysmal. I'm UK, seems like Boris started taking seriously lot people started die, got himself. Halloween Thanksgiving holidays outside America. Lobby government social safety net. I'm glad tell us think based experience kind relevant subject huge difference driving remote castle hosting bloody rave! 

What Cummings utterly idiotic, particularly given position, think two incidents level, could even repercussions other, clutching straws best. really hard conduct randomised study mask wearing think honest public health person confident saying far think masks work. obvious, masks would worn start - cheap easy make - fact, discouraged offset. probably work bit everyone wears one along social distancing hand washing masks control pandemic. Yessssss!!!!!!!!

Had never seen came Netflix I’m glad able experience it. Legend Kora well!!!! Welcome Nazi Germany, obey! Nah, BLM organizers don’t get charged neither prick. called Trump virus 2022? don’t live parents I’m healthy young adult underlying conditions. point would rather get able go back bit normalcy another year. literally also stand feet back ask question provides safety. cover mouth hand provide amount. talk facing away. Lol HIV standard virus. enigma. mutates everytime passed on. RNA virus, behave like them. (**Edit:** also clear infection like C19. long haulers testing negative eventually, damage caused infection remains. HIV patients remain positive although modern science infection levels brought way down.)

Most retroviruses common history (like herpes) DNA viruses. 

Your standard RNA viruses like influenza coronavirus acted retroviruses reason expect to.

Edit: specific coronavirus also fairly stable contrary popular belief creating new stable strains, creating new clades original SARS-CoV-2 far know Clade L, predecessor Clade caused Wuhan outbreak. Clades G, GR, GS dominant ones again, quite stable. virus optimized human spread, next step ""lifespans"" RNA viruses downward mutation killing host optimal. Thus RNA viruses usually deleterious nature.

SARS-1 mutating much quicker dead ended itself.

Influenzas mutate much rapidly novel coronavirus rearranging create new strains new strains displace seasonal strain. seeing near kind rapid mutation SARS-CoV-2.  No, definitely meant sarcastic. we're conditioned people putting sarcasm tag make sure people *don't* think actually shitty view. entertaining read watch crazy ass theories though, they? bad kooks exist though. story boyfriend me. arguments far between. cringe

I'm immunocompromised want get covid ""get used it"" like everyone else. We're gonna get anyway. 

I'm ready opt shit called life think life insurance would pay good old fashioned gun-in-mouth way.  L shouldn’t surprising. anyone telling going back pre covid normal mid late next year lying you. it? I've always heard placebo effect one necessary. Good know guess. Itll happen soon to, guess would byvthen end pf month point. Hopefully works could get distribution going end year. claim lead experiments minor criminals innocent people. sorry loss, deal crap others. that's pisses like nothing else. can't see front affect directly, exist everyone else making shit up.

Best wishes going forward! Avatar best quarantine binge watch! finally get jokes!  yeah I'm surprised say moronic stuff treating deadly pandemic seriously

 that's human nature actually believe since there’s ceiling, Covid won’t infect them. 

This stupid human beings are. 

They’re thing San Diego don’t even breeze half time. 

In fact breeze makes worse. need actual wind make risky. Good, needed slippery slope fallacy think experiments criminals already far Homie gonna working McDonald's, hitting double shifts. Everything us like fear Huawei spyware, actual hard evidence presented suggest China systematically manipulated data. get, China long list atrocities called for, wasting airtime stuff? even then, stories refusing treatment it’s hoax wrong. Stacking masks increase effectiveness. Lmao. Try form sentence without using ""whilst"". Also try forming sentence whataboutism.

Someone else breaking law excuse guy breaking law. true. It’s sooo complex though. example, hospitals make 2-3x much private insurance patient Medicare patient...meaning people insurance effectively subsidize Medicare (not uninsured.)

If switch “MediCare all” reimbursement rates would go waaaay higher. pay that. 

In short...
Quality, affordability, universal access. get pick 2. fucking retarded ignorant. schools terrible, anyone without money barely educated idea critically think. views manipulated emotional, non-fact-based news point objective truth anymore opinion. applies spectrum politics allows status quo continue unchecked. believe studies showing masks work much thought then? Gotta wonder covid gi stuff relates possible transmission food get decide lives dies? trying turn math equation ""me vs. world"" kind approach weird, unpleasant take virus spreads indoors enclosed spaces among people talk/sing socially distancing wearing masks. Outdoor protests complete opposite almost every way. There's already abundance proof outdoor protests masked individuals appreciably spread virus.

[EDIT] Downvoting change facts. outdoor protests spread virus cities seeing protests months would inundated cases. fact they're quite opposite. Fact. what’s point? restaurants aren’t means transmission? 

Restaurants huge transmission setting one place everybody sits together without masks on. 

I don’t see reason people always need insist they’re risky things. need do. ""Is exactly liberties lost"" - 'our' 'are'.

Yet response immediately following post complain ""don't seem writing correct english""

If going pedant call someone something petty, usually best ensure done exact thing calling for. start second wave here, slightest. would take miracle arrive March 2021 daily infections 5k mark knows mean always felt like spring things would drastically better. Maybe he’s offering worst case scenario

If get new treatments/therapeutics think whole narrative changes significantly  yeah definitely sounds selfish stupid deadly pandemic went talk hospitals need patients making enough money. need people sick go debt pay hospital bills big take away. Yeah, fined, government end day probably *wished* been, police investigated earlier, time, didn’t issue one, isn’t much guess. 

They hardly call police say, “hey, it’s Boris, need fine someone please. Yeah, it’s get tricky spot. guy want fined totally it, don’t worry getting sued politically motivated penalties anything.” 😀

Or maybe can... police UK bureaucratic legally risk averse genuinely doubt they’d asked. need harsher penalties US. even read article? People chattel red party. governor said old folks happy die preserve economy families.

I've always believed idea society judged treats old, young, prisoners. measures, good place live long time. even bad make bubble way NBA does. money anyways... someone going potentially give relative horrible disease due ignorance, knew ability ignorance, would wanna shop work? EU went side caution tried contain this, buying time.

This outright true. (I presume implied part ""meanwhile US nothing failed Even becomes hot America least unified effort. 

A. unified Europe every country mostly fighting itself.

B. realize US tried fairly hard? No? Look overall death/1M numbers, US reached UKFrance/Spain/Italy's level deaths/1M sometime July/August (Spain &amp; UK still worse US). So, yes, US slow spread 3 months. Whether effort sufficient (or misguided matter) separate US (federal) pretended like exist. plan. destroyed public trust health institutions.

Also, given fact public transportation shown many times safer cars, yeah think might better ban cars avoid traffic fatalities instead invest robust public transportation service. mean, necessarily

One things people look back understand entire mask debacle. wear masks. It’s one deadliest pathogens hundred years spread worldwide. (Edit: added one of)

No one years comprehend issue wearing masks. Many us don’t understand now. Im participating Pfizer trial. Here's hoping data helps crafting promising vaccine! Got science back claim friend? Meanwhile Canada, debt ratio going (but read article, rosy... better think mistaken

/s Wow went full crazy talk.

I would seek professional help based commented. I'm sadly shocked. I've talked someone recently works medical field serious matters hard time people wearing masks properly, covid deniers, such. Surprise surprise... cases. Conversely, I’m academic lab associated major medical center there’s eight -80s floor within ten steps office alone; there’s like 15 floors building similar numbers freezers like 4 buildings.

For centers, particularly large catchment areas associated academic labs, making enough room *thousands* vials -70 -80C freezers trivial. alone help service many major cities. good thing told us masks would help start. could've cause lot confusion problems not.

Yet signs everywhere saying we're precautions. *head scratching intensifies* Lol think smart person. best shitpost comment yet. Europeans logic!  lol Well yes makes sense early article admit far unproven apply covid masks stupid college kids care virus, infect others (family members, grocery store workers)..some end hospital could infect medical personnel. Leading outcome like this. mention many others could get sick die. cares, right? least college aged kids survive cares everyone else. report looooooooooong time ago? ;) hate takeaway packaging?! That's trash for. Yes, American, living US 😘 grand irony effect dampened completely absent without exposure due mostly others wearing masks community spread high rates.

&amp;#x200B;

If people wore masks, one would get immunity, though virus would still spread, slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

Absent vaccine, leads one theorize would smartest policy safely defeating virus liberty loving country (read one portion population stupid shit).

&amp;#x200B;

And conclusion come learned would fairly safe come protocols deal symptoms, otherwise allow young want, adults wear masks times indoors, vulnerable isolated young. post history full heavy drug steroid use, explained lot Clearly mean many people killed globally short span time, death rate. people build immunity, improve treatments, vaccines released kill fewer fewer people. Oh, well *forget then.* days think life would easier single. I'm cautious often reiterate importance keeping ones guard GF feel need to. honestly exhausting times trying ensure safe, human life also responsible. definitely made big changes adapted, man grow tired leading discussions good hygienic practices pandemic. Mine too! spaying really awkward tbh Irony, thy name mask I've got grade 9 spot community college. totally get mask wearing. attitude insane. vet also wear mask seems. Brought pet walking saw doctor maskless front lobby. Upon entering front desk staff also mask completely made phone call put talk me. I'm shocked. Masks required per signs them? I've also going vet years. one thing virus taught people know intelligent thought were. exactly took many screenshots uninstalled FB. even read title post? know peyote slays rad actual article clearly even read title. Masks protect wearer. prevent exodus project concretely reduce exposure less subprime symptoms. Please, PLEASE stop spreading disinformation.  first support voting rights get everyone vote. saw chiropractor first time weeks ago wore mask nose freakin hanging whole time. anyone really surprised? I'm pretty sure heard six months ago assumed government/media/doctors lacking nuance ""viral load"" ""minimizing exposure"" get focus masks PPE instead source control, going far even say ""masks protect you"".

Yeah. dumb. account shift seasonal summer schedules. school demand. need compare adjust.fke previous year better understand impact 40% already infected they're still setting daily records, highly doubt it. it’s still another anti-social behavior, wanting believe someone else maliciously. 

selfish, antisocial people going believe others must obviously behaving uncooperatively well. would never trust anti-mask healthcare professional. would explain much curious situation Taiwan. Officially, cases 100 days. BUT. People keep leaving island getting tested positive shortly after. health officials also refused random tests. month ago, dozens COVID-19 positive sailors got military vessel community days discovered. yet apparently nobody got COVID-19 sailors. How?

If study correct, extreme mask-wearing discipline might immunized good proportion population. explain asymptomatic carriers keep testing positive leave Taiwan nobody turning super sick hospitals.  Oh crap, scientific American fake dude Twitter real. I'm joking too. Stay safe friend. It’s weird mask actually help you🤔 daily routine boring anyways. give reasoning that? She’s obviously dumb really doesn’t make sense ask me. many Americans tantrums wearing piece cloth cough hole. necessarily. large group people enclosed room like high school stadium may expose people high viral load, especially multiple people sick expelling virus place poor ventilation. 

Social distancing may also reducing viral load addition masks. deactivated mine 4 months. I’m going completely delete soon. It’s much. minds blown guys going somewhere taking masks socialize people close proximity? (AKA: eat)

And time someone point since couldn’t figure yourselves. suspicion antimask debacle resulted Trump's vanity along impact Trump perceived would hospitality tourist industry obviously heavily invested in. also believe adversarial nation states poured fuel fire spreading misinformation masks. Ultimately blame Trump mask confusion. fact many willing blindly follow anti-mask death cult truly embarrassing episode US history. lot stuff reported media incorrect blatantly false. see that, ahead. many reasons misinformation spread. Many. Every time see carton, it’s way expensive. What’s workaround? wonder there's overlap religious people. pliable enough regard truth reality believe things without good evidence. *say* lots evidence, anti vaxxers conspiracy theorists. LOTS evidence none good, there's lots explaining circular logic anything get appraising evidence. good. No, that's science works. There's enough evidence enough evidence. Seems bit early claim immunity. today also told permanent effects virus. Require windows remain open wear N95 youve got fighting chance catch all. active FB couple years now, though still checked while, couple months pandemic started uninstall it. many people highly respected years posting worst stuff. 
It's disappointing point hurts. Like breakup. hope that’s accurate. I’m willing catch matter given health, idea another year confined exhausting. Seeing city party like crazy every night depressing. issue politicised, 'snowflake lefty remainers' wear masks etc vs 'fake news boomer leave voters' Covid-sceptic.  Population Europe TWICE US.
thanks downvote, known always thought conspiracy theories sort silly pass time mostly harmless. pandemic subs like one prove otherwise.

Conspiracy theory jet fuel social media absolute threat cultural stability civilization. one, certainly pilar. That’s don’t get. understand exactly kids feel? felt way March May least. lot also federal government hijacking PPE deliveries, would even worse. Nevermind people clearing N95's hardware store, imagine ten times many people getting bidding wars every shipment every supplier. 

I'm even saying lying good thing. I'm saying get it, black white situation simplistic months later everything Fauci experts say discredited. True health officials endorsed masks social distancing effective measures curbing spread coronavirus, experts scoff fever checks. Taking temperatures entry points nothing theater, say, gesture unlikely screen many infected individuals, one offers little illusion safety. difficult incarnate. I'm familyless friendless, plus credit shot Covid makes meeting strangers live together quite strenuous. I'm still trying move mostly trying emotionally survive. mean us Americans, got one time 1,200 payment months shut businesses permanently closing, got what? 2,000 several months, actual stimulus plan help citizens ?

Americans receiving $600 week top state benefits. healthy individual exposing virus potential develope immune response. 
TIL things already knew.

How quadrivalent shot work past flu season? ignore it.

It's right there. read it. magnitude different

You're taking classic reddit approach someone who's argument got obliterated. Ad Hominen deflect point.

Yes, Donny disgrace, point. point countries around world experiencing waves people let guard try resume normal life. uniquely ""pig headed"" American thing. think right. second wave may bring cases, think far less terrifying necessary processes either place least planned, help people get much easily first time. Sure, it’s also true eating restaurant aren’t wearing mask eating. know, live FL, never went home year. people died COVID... years decades ahead them.

Statistically, though.

Median age coronavirus death USA still 78-79, pretty much median life expectancy. don’t understand. job keep people safe, everything required that. matter asinine. 

Like it’s LITERALLY job. 

But nah party code ethics suppose. fell ""vaccines cause autism"" crowd Oprah signal boosted it. really sure why, cause autism (unless knows something lol)

Anyway, seem like better mom her. Keep fighting good fight. said expecting young people behave young people. I'm assuming comment means think person therefore typical young people.

What party middle pandemic refuse stop requiring police called.

If think neither things typical young people comment? It’s common misconception vaccine 50% effective makes odds immune 1/2. reality, vaccine distributed widely herd immunity starts kick virus doesn’t spread quickly. we’ll probably powerful therapeutics early next year well Science cannot move forward without heaps!

God could on. 1999 great year. cause deaths complications. Deaths already good idea binary outcome, complications still studied.  FL. WIV didn’t share findings 2020.

Worth noting *exactly* lab attempting study would holy grail research opportunity opposed particularly interesting sample gets filed away freezer. replaced new one Profiteering, capitalizing- different prepping. People seem draw line whether *they personally* need, interestingly. 90s even lasted Sept 2001, great. put effort spent 20% GDP banning high calorie foods, mandated exercise done something 800,000 cardiovascular disease-related deaths occur every year. '23? spend lot time youtube? I'm not. Children get infected get sick. means test positive spread virus. Hence phrase ""asymptomatic infections"" get takeout even wait inside order (I always call ahead order). Nooooo thanks. think they're projecting hopes onto kids. local parents reaalllly pushing hard everyone back school distance learning option masks. dumb people understand immune systems anyways. exactly this. Habits change. I'll probably never go back week grocery shopper. pre-pandemic would get 1 weeks worth every saturday sunday thing, we'd get coffee breakfast somewhere, hit maybe another store along way go grocery shopping. straight every two weeks go straight store straight home loaded 2 1/2 3 weeks food. 

That money i'm spending habit change around town. I've also gotten really good cooking again, recipe books ingredient prepping half battle. cook shit eating restaurants, even need go back ? well religious people think: happens god wills it, die/getting infected=shit happens cares them.

nuclear war?=praise lord

global peace=praise lord watched newsreel last week Hurricane 1938. Two things stood out: 

- many things left standing built WPA

- much rescue clean performed WPA workers

If feds mobilized early pandemic, lots people could working WPA-like jobs. WPA jobs artists photographers musicians entry-level workers laborers kinds. provided kinds folks gainful employment. 

Lord knows infrastructure could use it. Found guy care freedom. Nope. Expected. sub hates dissenting opinions. It’s - really think it’s ‘just flu’ hoax. high risk area get stay home, fuck shit. I've working throughout whole thing millions people.

Don't spread lies. coastal Florida, building visible mold within 6 weeks.  One pass air handler sufficiently dehumidify outside air starts 90F 90% humidity. like whenever anybody mentions isn’t good response subreddit “but Trump’s bad too.” subreddit filled many simpletons can’t seem comprehend two things bad time I’m Dakota, Sturgis stupid idea. family go, dumb risking it. gas brakes good video show dumb people are. destroying economy

It's relative. GDP still shrank 9.7% second quarter.  ""no politics""

one sub's rules don’t even person-to-person interactions, appointment phone car. I’m Ontario. condition people affected asymptomatic people? get I’m high risk, vaccine won’t 100% effective could still catch it, they’re saying people may still spread effectively immune themselves, half America refuses get vaccine wear masks. leave us high riskers? Stuck another 1-2 years confinement? feel like vaccine benefit healthy individuals way more, don’t see good way anyone who’s high risk sacrificing another 1-2 years life. I’m pro-vax given conditions around don’t see it’s going miracle fix anything less year more.

ETA: know vaccines work, hard time understanding I’m coming please try think high risk standpoint. figure? There’s million things wipe ass aren’t made paper sold roll. I’d wipe ass pieces old shirt I’d go without end hoarder I'm dude. much fucking fear mongering what? Like go outside walk around people... nothing scared of. fucking boogeyman he's always ""2 weeks away!"" come articles mention educators died schools closed? 74 NYC . always suspicion critical people invited parties young! happens Washington Square Park impact happens restaurants, completely isolated events. actually easier control crowds restaurants blocking tables ensure capacity compliance, spacing apart. Makes sense livelihoods would dependent bunch partying college students people 20s never listen matter restrictions put place. one many reasons I’m travelling work.

People suck title says ""might"" ""proven"". fuck wrong discussing scientific hypothesis opinion based evidence. America Envy stupid Yea makes sense. Well no. say elderly protect themselves. rest us massively destroy save them. did. even laughed said “it stop November 3rd”. 

That resulted sit director.

He didn’t. wanted flex pseudo science talking points got dear leader me. That's you've, rather bizarrely, inferred I've implied.  young people barely affected Covid they've already made great sacrifices.

He’s somewhere Elvis Tupac. Willfully ignorant, deniers, “we live virus” crew area ones frequent indoor restaurants. honestly reads like troll hit cliche talking points. love haha Anti-vaxxers hate things work. WWII happened shut nonessential industries put people work war effort. restaurant destined go business next six months what’s point kicking road til Christmas? It’s doomed concept, reason virus respect equivocation (aka “balance”) cares whether people house parties. shouldn’t. That’s fact? People around shouldn’t traveling. shouldn’t weddings. Maybe problem know lot bad people. also curious see many flu cases year. Usually never wore mask even someone office sick. people wearing masks everywhere go, washing hands, staying away others. Would interesting see affects illnesses. part country live? already wrong. infection rates shooting Spain month, death rates hand remained stable around ~40 day. Check graph here, top website right blue bars infections, red bars deaths. Reddit allows fucking anything gets bad press starts negative effect brand.

How many literal right wing terrorist murders discussed, planned glorified t_d Reddit shut down? much borderline child porn allowed /r/jailbait shut down? could put mask hygiene info instead, would accepted part. Bold assume begin with. true, UK cases coming people social distancing private homes would also bet going meals drinks etc. said that, lots people meals following guidelines spreading virus.  weird? wealthy fine continue accumulate, people can't afford houses selling wealthy people accumulate more.

Usa increasing income inequality, dynamic duo. people believe c19 dangerous advertised also believe lockdowns political medical.

So believe something that's equally stupid? Midwest resident. guy opted going bachelor party weekend restaurant. badly wanted go, resist covid fatigue. super bummed night of, know I'd feel guilty like zero integrity gone. They've spent/will spend £200 billion honestly think they're trying balance books £10k fines? want innocent beings die selfish purposes. i'm wrong? need get r/vegan, corrupting brain US. People went cheering us health care mocking us hospital walk by. elderly couple tell fake day drawing blood oncology unit. Like bruh hells going world. Would make difference know neither parents ever attended public school? (Not rich, Catholic.) Well stated. $$$ bribery that's required. Testing much available, one road me. called get test returned work told closest testing station 2 hours away. live small city population approx. 140k, testing readily available area good enough. You’re weird one:
avoiding curiosity supplying unnecessary hollow replies.
Must sth embarrassing it’s simply important enough.
Take good care yourself, farewell. I'm going breweries sitting outside every couple weeks friend two friends MAX. somebody lives alone previously battled bad depression little bit normalcy absolute wonders mental health. Way online therapy sessions. know little selfish health they'll still go? Yes geo
And Georgia much better, considering leadership US prepare zombie invasion months time? Study differentiate indoor outdoor dining. agree completely. save strength mental fortitude yourself, means writing anti-maskers, it. Depends it. example schools actually announced detailed plans going far December int terms reopening others went fuck come back expelled/held back year.  get that, lol transmitted disease families? Educated smart. 
Before COVID would thought common sense would enough inform median i.q. population wearing mask would help. 
Obviously wrong. Wow! wonder much fun is?   Young people party, certainly enough restraint there's ongoing emergency house parties. may may serious war would similar scale major national-level event; reasonable think people act always like nothing's happening. Perhaps next time go witch doctor want people around act according science bias believe BS virus.

That includes believe protest crowds can't spread it. Utterly ridiculous magical thinking flies face science.

One buffoons downvoted New York Times noting ten epidemiologists confirm protests spread virus.  hard take buffoons seriously. virus care crowded together.

EDIT: see buffoon downvoting. Two play stupid game. $$$, nothing else matters them. Agreed. airborne factor that's big issue here.

With barely fresh air, maybe even AC recirculating air, matter people spaced out, easily get infected there's someone infectious there. 

That person, without mask, breathing talking many virus particles 2/3 hours they're room. aerosols floating without fresh air, worse, recirculated throughout room AC. People breathing long time. Maybe way pick mom bring appointment they'd prefer contaminate air car. Surely innocent coincidence right?  Hong Kong crushed spike nearly two hundred cases per day single digit four weeks. without shutting restaurants dine massive work home mandate.

I think barely know virus transmitting confounding variables determines body fight disease. current measures based general understanding infectious disease, specific coronavirus. wearing mask lead getting sick, never coulda guessed. Seriously though, people really want get normal, can't blame them. let pregnant women get abortions bc body, body get sick with. Right? teacher make million dollars Instagram YouTube. swear turning movie “idiocracy” every day. We’re screwed. Good idea I'm wondering effective it'll actually be. recall imported case NZ infected passed first test get positive test week later isolation.  No, “outcomes effort” comment pay attention to. doesn’t care much we’re working hard we’re trying. thinks pay based children’s “outcomes,” “outcomes” lower year, pay. It’s ridiculous standard set. like guns. Oof hit nerve peeps listening lol bad, official numbers put US mortality 3.07%. 6.5M cases, 195K dead. “Sorry took money plans reimburse you. Please enjoy college experience” wonder enough teachers would die we'd legitimate shortage. That'd tragedy. define necessary, maybe read little better 

But guess arguing wall now, need BLM this, sure assuming would get pissed lol

When 3+ people community you’re making assumptions disagree you, maybe ask you’re wrong. Can’t make assumptions people’s moral values

Cheers mate, great life like Dumblin. Florida them? terms what? Geographically, Georgia South Carolina Florida. Yup way likely bring spread it. Hence study results...So want stay away people likely sick, enclosed space, dine in. Big says we’re ready go? Well we’re ready go!!!! get million figure world wide annual flu deaths? can't find anything back up. US obviously rates wazoo compared usual flu deaths. got bubble rapid testing going HARDCORE, could pull off. People can't handle restrictions much longer. sure US, live honestly see us wearing masks beyond December 2020... Please let know Americans start wearing mask. initially right thing first time closing plants, Trump ordered open again. 

Here's one hundreds stories: brainwashed, here's ""fake news"" version Fox TV.  rock hard place. great majority population (and I’m group) idea read information. give information freely, misread rumors start (check conspiracy subreddit). don’t give out, hiding something. It’s kind no-win situation. Zombies? Social distancing, I.e., trying crowd much pretty easy onerous. dont think people mean dinner friends, go parties concerts, places like shopping, transit, wherever reasonable instead getting other's grills damn time Yeah relative COL. I’d rather make $14k/year Ecuador 15$/year NYC clear: I'm implying US well Europe try. Ultimately, fully expect US worse Western Europe due US's lack federal coordination, chaotic medical system, clueless leader-in-chief, etc

 happened America comparison people make sub.

By indicators. America's spring lockdown successful Spain's, Italy's, France's, Sweden's etc,it slow pandemic 3months (everywhere NorthEast)

The issue successful enough hurt much US could keep uncontrolled outbreaks like Brazil, US India.

I know Brazil India, 

A. US outbreak consists nearly 50 disjoint (policy-wise) outbreaks
B. state outbreaks us uncontrolled Europeans ones: Lockdowns, masks, large-scale testing, etc... Let us die! Let us die! Let us die! \#freedumbs Yeah. smartest chip block. vying scape goats everything could get them. Honestly ridiculous.

He really thinks stupid. Downvoted. Please downvote comment. Nobody gives shit meat prices. Yeah, argued people start. Even think engineered/intentional/all X’s fault... shouldn’t want avoid same? like arguing blackout curtains blitz mad Germany broke treaties isn’t fair. Guess what, doesn’t matter because, cool kids say, now! mean mindset working global superpower chose contain coronavirus. No. insurance company already said cover anything covid related long Canadian government travel advisory warning people go US. already hard insure mother law oxygen diabetic.  sometimes transmit virus? Great, charge organizers guy. Especially since they’re repeatedly holding events. 

You also realize mask isn’t magical talisman wards virus. There’s reason healthcare workers wear N95s, surgical masks disposable gowns coming contact COVID patients. think it’s don’t believe hard enough racial equality? Let us die! Let us die! Let us die! mean really wanting people get sick? numbers still pretty substantial. he's letting rip, even dumb person understand bad idea  Sounds like something Chinese would say. Fucking duh. Okay representative wait days?

I agree November realistic estimate agree Nov / Dec likely happen.

I sent remind notification see actually good estimate leaned towards agreeing.

Btw public blame. guidance clear. Wear fucking mask follow local council guidelines. wear mask closed spaces dramatically reduced social interactions. That's common sense. selfless way be.

I'm sorry can't blame anyone else fucking idiots see walking without masks consideration people's growing personal space. love it. could left anytime replied, keep going going decide solution ban. course it’s feasible.

There tons people cohabitate vulnerable. 

Why exactly locked down? You’re destroying livelihoods millions young people MIGHT come contact high risk individuals?


How reasonable response? sounds like plague inc easy mode game news headline lol Yeah, studies clearly show covid sentimental avoids weddings funerals. great governors opened restraunts up. death toll surges dec. claim blood hands gonna shrug say cares let slide? make point. 18 age decision making mature. levying fines showing consequences way show individuals rights adults, poor impulse control laws need followed.

It's well documented negative reinforcement socially calling someone modify behaviors. can't let ""kids"" hook argument. One thing know age, self centered manipulative. give kids get jail free card would promote behavior.

Your argument would better served say change age kids drive drink 26. saying we're fault wanting consequences.

I see many kids campus following protocol. I'm fine kid made answer throwing party. worth repeating. Florida really care come not. Canadians missing good weather due problem avoided $5 mask. like avoiding drive Florida gas went 10 cents gallon. literally told ""Plandemic"" fellow weak getting virus residual symptoms (Loss Smell, Fatigue, Shortness Breath) head also mentally weak.  believe you. Hong Kong crushed cases hundred day single digits four weeks. never fully shut restaurants providing dine service *any* time.

Restaurants dine compliance government CDC guidelines. BLM marches not. see plenty videos photos marchers wearing masks. Show single statement CDC says crowded gathering safe without social distancing. Economy said: bye :/ least government fined it. U.S., probably wouldn’t law enforcement interfere except usual non-pandemic reasons (noise complaints, drug use, underage drinking, etc) clearly using situation power grab Nobody, except cbc, claiming Denmark anything fantastic, government lot monitoring try lock areas Covid-19 breakouts. Exactly like responsible government world.
Nobody really knows works doesn’t. 

Right 631 deaths 5,6 million people, authorities doesn’t bad job. Best news year. Hopefully people sack wear them.  also see many masks. exactly think terrifying covid? 

The approximately 0.2% IFR - heavily weighted age (under 50 years old something like 0.02% IFR, drops dramatically look younger demos). 99.8% survival rate terrifying? 

Or ... maybe it’s covid, like flu viral infections, damage various organs cases?

Or maybe what’s terrifying fact that, like flu respiratory illnesses, people get wind lingering fatigue breathing issues take year resolve? 

Personally, think virus fucking terrifying use word “novel” describe it. I’m glad disease targets narcissists sociopaths. 

Umm... basing statement fact exists reality? curious. Good riddance. 

What exactly think happen 99.8% people get covid? exactly think they’re going? Cannot imagine lines stores Plus, recycling, melting stuff get back raw materials wasn’t issue, according article. making consumer-sized finished product without buying new machines, etc. Interesting, world wide pandemic live 18? 

It’s lack knowing. Teenagers generally know rules well. It’s wherewithal suppress strongest biological urge time unimaginable stress... money... substantial job experience. 

Some might better time strong financial social supports. Even then, aren’t setting realistic expectations young people.

As heard one psychologist put it, we’re putting kids social diet... throwing book break it.

We’re setting fail, can’t expect level fully developed adults lived achieved level stability life. sure that's relevant point okay. Besides, public policy paper really give axiological support assertion. /s? Please say '/s' Young healthy people interact/live 50. feasible lockdown 50 allowing rest society go business normal restrictions enforcement, people obey health protocols tests antibody test swab test expensive depends well vaccines work. near 100% effective vaccine need nearly many people secure herd immunity 75% effective vaccine would. First generation vaccines unlikely work well we'd like. tested. probably waiting results. symptoms put quarantine. ignored quarantine though. agree LA County seems attempting provide level transparency personal level, really change behavior - assume Covid everywhere avoid problematic situations entirely terms feeling someone authority ""gets it"" attempting bring level accountability mix - positive.

It really show class income impact one's safety though many really large sites obviously employing low wage workers. One really large sites LA Apparel exposed LA Times huge number cases tried hide. Whenever start getting bit depressed personal situation think lucky ability isolate forced engage high risk behavior economics forces work packing plant high risk place. high risk blaming worker actual situation risk contagion difficult protect oneself exposure likely. mean ""so what"". clear day failure system makes seem overly harsh. dunno got downvoted regularly read shit comments articles either sub coronavirusus people got trolled manner.

Shit sucks Im 1995 1996 right now....

Living inside head cool. news, water still wet. Also could encouraged us early making clothe mask. Talking best fabrics simple patterns. Also saying even bandanna scarf better nothing buy make mask You’re acting like im saying get someone fired saying didnt like newest Marvel movie shit. 
Im saying people openly attack someone FB brother dying virus fake. dont try change im fucking saying god dman mouth breather. 

Actually read think even think spewing stupid shit out.

Btw already got one co-workers fired wearing maak guess bad feel? Lmao  know saw asympltomatic lead asymptomatic, would make things eazy, get symptomes youi get someone asymptomatic, that's problem. Yup. There's absolutely way low. .06 percent population almost exactly current death toll (200,000) we're even close getting everyone infected. kid gets fined Cummings faces consequences. Despite covid travelled.

If one rule another thee expect resistance measures. course since people get tested. I’m teacher school opening k-12 soon (previously open “only” k-3 loophole let cohorts 10 4-12 come part days, meant really open already) I’ve say uncomfortable classroom kids. feel awful putting district position, cases rising here, community completely ignoring science, it’s safe. one fully knows long term effects. definition takes long time become apparent. 

Given long term effects far identified, whole ""it's flu"" get back ""normal life"" appropriate.  know, bet lives, quite still would. 

 many live people high-risk bad outcomes get it, teachers putting loved ones first.

That's it. Despite that, *still* 90% everything around home kids (having come home work it, conversations oldest, ""watching kids"" playing video games occasionally refilling milk cups them. almost interaction, stimulation, actual parenting going - even categorized SAHD.) Suddenly home schooling? Yep, too. bothered, *video games play*. put foot started expecting step - happen. refused. then, one day, sits guise chatting baby, tl;dr ultimatum's (I love anymore, want baby, please put adoption kthx) dumps me. living across country less month later.

Going ?% 100% requirement mask going cause shortage different happened toilet paper.

The toilet paper shortage supply chain issue compounded panic buying shortages started. TL/DR: People buy TP home using TP work restaurants/stores ... stuck home; plenty industrial TP, enough shoppers prepared hunker home indefinitely avoid coronavirus, wiped Amazon, supermarkets across America, clean bathroom basic. People might need much 40% toilet paper home “occasions” (as industry calls them) would otherwise happen workplaces, restaurants, hotels. bought far more: Sales nearly 71% year year nine weeks May 2, according Nielsen. would risen even higher—except people can’t find enough toilet paper buy.

Edmonton one sane non-conservative island Here's latest case/death charts North South surprisingly, charts look pretty similar. states 21 deaths per 100k population, ranking 41st 39th respectively terms per capita Many? They're going year. said said...all Europe performing poorly. Farci stick it. little creep.   another huge swarm virologists doctors epidemiologists frequent reddit 🙄 what, change person did, made choice party risk lives stop caught.

Whataboutism change that. funniest shit seen days. Incredibly sad, funny! 

Sorry Canada. lived Canada 6 months, country basically described, getting baked shit hash (I think?) depressed friend. kids mortgage, addition car payment another ten years student loan? dying parent boss resents every hour take piles work return? boss hate can't leave spouse got laid find another job, quitting means income benefits? medical issues require constant rounds doctor visits procedures, interfering job preventing things love? spouse cancer, take care addition children, wondering need planning funeral person love? 

All experiences happened one friends colleagues years. I'm 53 age 27 pretty sweet too. I've lived long enough see others go college far worst stress people ever have. premed, too. Full time classes full time work, try minimize student loans. worked full time grad school too, taking full time course load (I decided doctor me).

Enjoy charmed life, enjoyed mine. I'm bad. I've seen friends colleagues I've lucky. far universal experience. Hahahahahahaha,,,,,you braindead he! Here's latest case/death charts Virginia, running 7-day currently 32.22 deaths per 100k. ranks 28th among states per capita  Oh, understood perfectly.

While effects broad-reaching, fundamental *cause* climate change rise global average temperature adding energy system. temperature start going stayed there, would fact solve climate change.

But go off, seem like you’re fun don’t wanna ruin ya  Western Australia zero community cases done months premier kept borders closed. ones get coming overseas go quarantine hotels. Victoria big outbreak seems control lockdowns, NSW &amp; Qld. Northern Territory, SA, ACT Tasmania none like us. people there's money

It's false choice pick money people pick ""money"" end money LA stated strategy reason masking several months now. idea term it. figured low dosing, longer periods time, would slowly build immune response getting sick get overexposed. 

Basically, think we're microdosing virus properly masking distancing public. Oh 2 months enough Thailand, Malaysia much calmer less stressful (also less fun) choice foods far greater (they great thai restaurants too). get need fine. point think particularly fair give someone maximum fine cannot pay applying government too. really wanted make example start government.  We’ve eaten outdoors twice, won’t eat indoors there’s vaccine. inactive portion virus sit around mucous membranes while, without danger infect. feature RNA tests we've known long time. idea is, better false positvie false negative. honest, virus present tiny numbers emerging evidence unlikely result full-blown, contagious infection. That's fact masks work protect wearer.

I think could dial back amplification sure. luckily able see Tenet day smaller movie theater. people total theater. Keep telling that. 

We wouldn’t want strain actually think. love complimenting people’s masks. feel like helps normalize me. Like, it’s another accessory. teach monkeys research? Yes. Even broken clock right twice day. Covid9 lockdown, cause much stress. remove lot ways people normally relax stress. produce better tests effective vaccine, might worth using. Honestly surprised Guardian... Atlantic pretty good kind thing. Next time want charge. Oh, antivaxxer conspiracy theorist brother still believe real neice Covid badly call ambulance out.

Some people double down, find way deny it. account he’s replying 11 years old Two simple points:

1) Much much worse **who** expected?  I'm surprised whole house cards folded.

2) that, prototypical NPR story: ""It's end world; Blacks minorities hardest hit"". people harassing victims families calling fake shit.

They're exact thing Covid victims families. reason harassment rise extreme levels many victims, none testifying congress, trying get legislation passed. Conspiracy nuts wicked evil streak caused self righteousness. You’d want google “covid long haulers” Thats viruses work. Im calling B.S. Stop acting know nature virus. Sit observe situation develops. nut job ""An reliance masks""? Anyone says privileged live area people mask. 

Where (Idaho), people wearing masks. actually big anti mask rally last night. 

Please wear mask. Back March clear advice was;

* Masks work.

* Medical professionals others benefit masks since higher risk catching COVID-19.

* horde masks indirectly putting people greater risk since fewer masks protect potentially exposed high viral load.

So, based kept used masks donated unused ones local hospital. Since then, I've gotten masks. half Government stay work home worried Virus, full pay etc, make scheme suits businesses. Businesses like snubbed come running need payments taxes buy nice month away holiday. ludicrous.

I really feel you. Grainger sells industrial grade Honeywell respirators stock last checked, add filter run $75. available P/N95 P/N100 r/popping best offer... Doubt it. lot wealth transferred rich people bad economic times... stocks go sale, real estate prices crash, etc. Bring whatever want snitching someones employer said internet, dont like it, hopes termination... thats incredibly low. 

Hell connection work, maybe. Plumber admitting intentionally fucks work something. Thats fine. 

But logic ""He said something like, whats easier way hurt him"", thats fucked up.

RDIT: yes, forget anonymously. Thats highest high roads ever. country supposed mimic?

[South That's standard bearer pandemic control among non-island countries. 

They getting second wave back control. Obviously magnitude different, reality same: People around world can't handle reality fight COVID end widespread vaccine place. get case counts continue done cases low, even incredibly low. don't, exponential growth always continues. Yup. American ""business leaders"" want I'm talking small businesses, cause larger ones cared short sighted, lot problems right - want everyone ignore problem, go back work, get back good little consumers. fucking sick. 

If lobbied constantly lower corporate tax rates, shredding social safety net, destroyed worker protections, willfully ignorant comes widening gap rich poor, perhaps would better response. Instead, rapacious greed relentless destruction social fabric reaped sewn... whaddya know, they're crying fault actually trying protect people economy harm. lot people dont care I'm at. say sorry people go this. amount people dont care listen see real heart breaking. dad showed video dude Facebook us currency. guy video showed fold think 1 dollar bill certain way flip upside George Washington looks like wearing mask. So, guess basically saying government trying control virus fake. We’ve come point money people.  it’s us put stop don’t November... may never recover original comment stream started someone bewildered poor yet eating rich. I’m explaining that’s happening. Totally agree marching activism I’m glad you’re I’m part sort stuff. Also totally agree satisfied small comforts (or even historically large comforts capable much now). take quite bit actual violence risk everything don’t think it’s close point yet. Really? asked relevant question. response didn’t answer it, went irrelevant rant (why respond all?). 

I pointed comment nonresponsive question. illogically jumped insulting comprehension (I assure you, fully understand wrote - doesn’t make responsive question). 

Feeling smart doesn’t mean are. Consider learning logical fallacies spot - it’ll help you. great day! That's viral diseases work, generally. Stop trying create monster bigger one already have. would think something fact virus new perhaps fatal beginning prior exposure. say it’s still deadly believe is, perhaps immunity built point really realize. context purely hypothetical  UBI, physical mobility much greater.

Tying locality CoL politically infeasible, impossible practical standpoint would cause greater increases cost expensive areas. masked January 24th, saw first set leaked videos Wuhan. You’re bad mod takes days find stuff low post.  literally nothing suggests virus spreads easier winter Source? Harris wanted $2000 Pandemic UBI per month us hope Joe Biden make happen. think win.

It's essentially Canada CERB - $2,000 month several months questions asked. SIL applied online funds deposited account 4 hours later. really lifeline helped several family members continue pay mortgage keep roof head.  Shut fuck up, piece absolute garbage spouse slightly less risk-conscious am, came compromise - goes somewhere like non-essential dental appointments office trip, wear masks home several days afterwards case. help keep us balanced, extremely worried gives sanity. think lucky communicate things well, take things personally get hurt feelings. Stop using innocent animals torture start using convicted pedos, murderers, rapists, arsonists instead. skilled enough get people-- I'm learning apparently possible get people. used try, now, soon feel like I'm talking brick wall, stop. (sadly) futile worth (or your, anyone's) time mental energy. can't reason people position reason into. Sounds like cartels got 8800 new child soldiers  Mask shortages, monkey shortages, teacher shortages...



Someone piss poor job planning this!



It's almost like believed bullshit 15 cases would turn 0, Covid-19 would disappear Easter like miracle. actually sounds much like many non cult member redditors comes vaccine. amount armchair sciencing going worn varnish right wood. ...

Yeah, you’re worth going  Oh well natural selection hit hard. people married first place then. It’s naturally wealthy country, shitty form government.  basically, terrible politics usual. One side refuses acknowledge give credit other. house jammed bill full nonsense knew GOP would never allow pass. blame GOP. GOP thing know Dems never accept. playing games, people suffer sides shit. Vaccines already vegan ingredients. Checkmate. Well maybe living large family?? Personally didn’t get either. Dude too! learned much era history channel miss every day Why? massive issues distributing vaccines less stringent cooling requirements.  One real reasons frontline workers didn’t proper PPE- facilities refused pay upper tier pricing acquire suppliers instead bought heroes work signs. 

Source: family healthcare, I’m nurse sales. legit got offers surgical N95 masks stock healthcare facilities wanted pay pre Covid prices. marked 10% cost upfront it. would flat refuse move on. 

It’s PPE isn’t even available, it’s budgets profit margins, worker patient safety. Trump says certain special day. blame Barenaked Ladies, keep promising groupies monkeys. Gonna wearing masks long term too! got cool ass masks. would able spread students adults. That’s issue well. forgot /s Always you’re implying school districts keep morbidly obese teachers home higher Covid risk, exactly brought staff? weight limit? weigh teacher? since there’s teacher shortage country-wide, going fill positions? tell students, “Your teacher teaching virtually weight.”? Seriously, maybe think one through.   worked rehab facility height COVID started accepting COVID positive patients. wear full PPE. train put on, take dispose PPE, actually mention you’re highest risk contaminating you’re taking PPE. it’s done correct order, proper fashion (proper glove removal), contaminate get sick nothing effectiveness PPE protocol. 

Not saying happened OPs daughter, pointing often overlooked detail wearing PPE. Agreed. think people written year going go 2021 expecting live lives pretty much fully Unfortunate, ER isn’t appropriate place that. Urgent care, PCP, state testing facilities are. ER facility fee (the minimum you’ll charged checking in) around $1500. independent billing, cost test. Plenty asshole monkeys. Coke sold Sunkist Polar much smaller. Sunkist supply chain took hit due brand sold!  even sure confirm theory 

You would intentionally expose healthy people covid virus, sure would allowed happen. Actually runny nose prevalent symptom covid. Google covid symptoms prevalence. Rhinorreah (runny nose) presents approximately 45% covid patients. I’m done Fauci. 

He nothing useful—just instilling fear already-terrified folks. far know, nothing warned us came true. Lest forget expert there. one scientist ever seen ultimate authority: even distinguished wrong sometimes. got dysautonomia 20 yrs old bad flu, definitely confirm debilitating. Thankfully mostly passed me, although get flares occasionally  basically, masks dont help preventing spread.... got W fucking HO? #facepalm Anti science actually really common, probably places life disregard science. Im sure perfect regard even though think smart rational person. South America? I'm days this. I've muscle pain fever far. mandatory everywhere that's thing. way careful america, infections going they're going america (down 50% since peak july)? click USA World ok mask help that? genuinely going wear mask forever whenever now. destimatized get looked judgement unless they're antimasker whose opinion equals naught anyways. Also stay 6 feet away. talk me. fact, stop existing. Thanks! made another night.  is...weird. definitely different anything I've experienced. 

My 17 year old ""whatever really affect age group"" it. wears mask 24/7 work? Probably not. place filled teens think they're immune stuff. Here’s interesting video maths mask wearing, you’ve seen yet:[Why masks matter Yup always long time. mean sit crank it. Social media sucks bad. people fucking radicalizing making superiority group sooOoo woke virus everyone else stupid. Fuck that. fucking horrible thing social media people. Poor monkeys. Always wondering mankind forces animals testing stuff humans need themselves. WSJ mad got kicked out.

But seriously, what's hard saying they're expanding trials hundreds thousands? report Oxford vaccine way? Thousands injected experimental vaccine? Screw kid. himself.


Hopefully others see decide act like dumbasses.  Again, fewer people getting disease due social distancing &amp; lock downs, etc. means medical system less overwhelmed. Thus allowing need treated; allowing get support need survive initial bout virus. combined improved treatment plans tools would allow us save people. 

Where read virus mutations? killed someone? wasn’t aware that, sorry. Oops. That's vegans moving onto anti-vaxx list. anyone else. people Intensive Care Units USA States given bills pay discharge $250,000 don’t even Job day full shitty news, nice read something nice finally. It’s pretty nice random men tell smile walking street. infection is, general, one gets virus genetic material one's sinuses. problem is, viruses inject cells genetic material turns cells virus factories. Even way wipe “free floating” virus particles bodies UV, wouldn’t bit good. Millions would quickly burst forth already infected cells. It’s impossible selectively destroy lung cells infected without causing massive tissue damage. Nah, shit own, virus needed. mean enough enough man, way many people aren’t taking thing nearly serious enough. Fines like hopefully help idiots start may wishful thinking.. lockdowns last checked. repeatedly uses phrase ""we find"" ""we conclude""


I've explained context paper depth. want continue ignoring reality paper fit desire something outraged over, cant stop anymore stop people believing satanist, cannibal pedophiles running world lizard god.

Enjoy conspiracy theories ignorance, I'm out. everyone old gets covid dies. Lots ""recover"" linger severe health problems damaged organs. going eat lot medical resources decades come. think grandma, damaged lungs covid, going graciously accept fate reject medical care associated carelessness? *NO, SIR,* bet not! going put whole family drain savings family trying keep breathing next ten years. Upon reading article, headline appears reasonably accurate.  seems disagreement among experts significance tests show positive large number cycles amplification.  

The use statistics include cases determine rules mitigation, closing schools, thereby also called doubt.  

What would various units government differently number positives 25% lower, given fraction MN required 35 cycles, 45% lower representing required 30 cycles? Where's profit that! news I’ve read far says trial stopped July due neurological problem. person found undiagnosed MS. 

This recent pause also due neurological problem. aren’t telling us believe vaccine not. 

They citing “privacy reasons” disclosing happened recent person.

People need make minds means. 

Personally, live Florida, I’ve seen enough political games careful trust. schools refuse disclose positive tests employees students, citing “privacy reasons.” schools disclose academic test scores. 🤷‍♀️

My guess person bad reaction vaccine, whatever happened included whatever “adverse side effects” list see future. 

There 100% safe vaccines. It’s matter ensuring doesn’t hurt kill *too many* people, won’thurt kill anyone. like every vaccine. coworker lives unhealthy lifestyle, swears needs go chiropractor every two weeks. actually concerned health, don’t think she’d getting better, maybe he’d advise stop McHeart Attack sandwiches everyday? I'm American know current IC numbers, live véry close call beds left went lockdown. We're still way careful America barely people IC now, infections going hoping stays among young people explode like march Maybe.

That's something buckets money fix, though.

Can't throw money behavioral issues. infected. merely recovered (or well way recovery) thus infectious anymore. still good idea log confirmed case swab contacts, contacts could infectious.  Face masks could giving people super powers, researchers suggest. 
Face masks could giving people spare cash, researchers suggest. 
Face masks could giving people goosebumps, researchers suggest. 
Face masks could giving people cure cancer, researchers suggest. 
Face masks could giving people shiny day, researchers suggest. every American right? Every single one? know fact? Well work policy call sick reason, stubbed toe earache coming back without negative Covid test. NEJM actually used variolation term home schooled 5 18. vaccines wear mask. mom initially resisted hers, wears one (she want anything face). 190k. fucking crazy. Sometimes hits me, think absolutely crazy. Duh, what’s point?

Don’t bother wearing mask nobody else is? People easily forget bit idea concluding post. alternative would've fewer cases health care workers completely unable treat patients. one leads deaths honestly obvious. 

The real problem dumbasses still refuse inconvenience one tiny bit collective good. still existed 6 months ago. Gotcha! Thanks clarifying. want rescind idiooots comment apologize good ppl reddit quick response get it? wealthy country small percentage wealthy. rest wealthy, never real wealth. Many put far debt chasing illusion wealth little hope financial stability. pandemic crash highlights reality.

Also, much America's wealth actually massive debt. easy look wealthy trillions extra money play with. comes though, trumps ""elites"" busy pilfering wealth people, little left over... correct one use Facebook many choose to. Facebook decisions make information presented information censored impacts society. Decisions free speech hands. find concerning. ‘private’ platforms websites across internet ‘private’ still held accountable rhetoric decide endorse. Definitely one thing thing I’ve learned life time using Facebook common sense isn’t common. get this, want preface something; disparaging legitimacy facemasks, absolutely continue wear masks wlaking public places.

The reason asking now, I've seen lot buts come things recent months. Good bad, wanted things ""known"" gave sense stability. please upset asking this, though I'm sure sick tired seeing discussion get brought up.

In regard, want talk when, earlier year, Doctors TV stating ""no evidence all"" masks worked. understand story agreed masks short supply time, medical experts wanted reduce public use Hospitals go without. still seems peculiar seemingly gone shared outright lie meet end, makes kind understand folks got much faith advice medical professionals. ""if *that* lie, assume they're saying *now* true?""

Now, guys produce reason necessary publically declare something false, I'll happily believe you. really want believe something, right now. I've saying since June always dismissed ""oh wow care Wall Street human lives?"" like actually no, realize working class families going fall financial cliff. Come on, don’t know coronavirus hoax
Tone read “ sarcasm “ Duhkotas. kick man he's down, 'cha!

Also, warehouse full somewhere? shelf life that's slightly shorter candy corn, know made since 1926! people dying funny you? I'm prepared reduced guest count, masks dancefloor, socially distanced outdoor dinner, rapid testing guests, etc

This sounds depressing feel sad people always imagined big wedding ""COVID wedding"".  shove UV light bulb ass! discussion paper, scientific study. 

It's clearly marked such. confusing journalists covering stuff recognize difference point.

The paper overstate impact not, intended to, state actual impact kind authority all. 

In cases, discussion paper *intended* debunked new research better data research scientists. They're meant used scientists things like building better data models future research clinical studies. 

They certainly meant mischaracterised studies utilized media confuse public. median age COVID death higher life expectancy. Young people really reason fear this. fairness, every single one outlets link discussion paper, would allow readers make decisions veracity reporting. pointed may peer reviewed (being discussion paper, undergone rigorous peer review process - think ever really destined journal). think many people took report seriously. rational person would assume kinds numbers worst case scenario. Anonymized cell phone data hardly adequate purposes epidemiology. clear, however, case numbers South Dakota started going quite quickly starting August 20. That's probably coincidence. Two sparsely populated states too. Whoopsy  agree....so much fear mongering going on...of course tell us entire story. I'm sure easy tell that, certainly people died home covid, would call one ask.

I've also heard people getting turned away hospitals numbers match insurance required letting stay end dying home, that's separate issue.

I'm also guessing hospitals full issue, overworked doctors nurses I'm guessing prone making mistakes. know number comes I've heard want 30% free icu beds minimum. numbers likely overestimated.

But still sociopathic host and/or attend rally. fact going change matter much polish turd. redditor talked girl?  fact death Europe still relatively low, actual lag cases death, really speak many actual cases back January kept hidden. Eventually nobody really care... probably November election... take lot longer recover economic collapse tho. inflation coming... least getting hit car increase chances everyone else around getting hit car. think US lockdown bad - Wuhan, lockdown happened right Chinese New Year, many people visit families. lot people locked spouses, also locked in-laws. also allowed leave homes except scheduled trips downstairs pick grocery deliveries. also backyards (Chinese cities almost entirely condos). Great business divorce lawyers lifted. good news day terrible article. number flights spread weeks months insignificant compared total number flights time frame. real bottle necks planes airports infrastructure third world. pointed below, every person planet needs vaccinated once.  7.8 billion doses likely needed available course months. want Trump finally find bad pandemic really is. want CDC collect data again, HHS also altering CDC reports. clear we're lied to, I'm tired it. make decisions protect families we're told truth. want president lies spare ""feelings"". tell truth, lay front me, stop treating like 5 year old. 76 year old mother asks safe run small errand, want truthful data help guide decision.  I'm sick this, November cannot come fast enough me. Long enough actually virus control lifting it, opposed putting back fuel fire still burning?

Sweden one world's highest death rates Taiwan stopped publishing excess death. hey long care human life great. Pfizer dosed today. number 255XX. sorry, caste system this? Imagine traumatized team going realize one positive players probably gave him. Thank you. mean? would get board banning cars told many people die highways every year? (and 80 year olds poor health) Thank you. Thank you. Well issue ppl seem forget virus started one single infection look state world now. fact end effective safe vaccine. everyone would wear damn mask times outside home car certainly would easier keep things control reason seems much ask many ppl. Normal U.S. always quite miserable horrendous. 

I really hope U.S. never returns previous form 'normality', rather constructs novel progressive form 'normal'.

With world state environmental, political, economic, social, mental health crisis, desire nostalgic return previous state must progressive forward something new. keep growth curve, get much attention Georgia Florida.

C'mon SC, know it! incredible touch people like yiu think people itching return normality, compliance things like social distancing finite. 

I know yiur heart set world converting warped shut mentality, sorry, gonna happen Victoria opens up, what? can’t go forever without contact rest world. experience, conservatives believe government that. better private individuals help private individuals. refuse see would efficient government handle it.

My dad told everything liberals want government do, private companies efficiently. Ignoring fact that's case people afford exploit workers. conservatives also seem think can't afford exploited, fault need go school work harder get better job. ex-husband walking encyclopedia? Someone tell Google! ""As long takes"" take lot authoritarianism enforcement jailing people, many trying put bread table. willing that? Actually... Good News flair... That's much casuistry me. means we're still track \~30k deaths added less two months. rate somehow acceptable you, honestly know tell you. a) recommended masks beginning instead telling us ""they work"" saying ""they protect others"" acknowledged ridiculousness this, b) convince us best ""flatten curve"" pressure US citizens eliminate virus know non-compliant nature many skeptical vaccines, c) tried open bars schools even open consider makes importance education look country, d) effective leadership top instead responses varying state state based governor bidding wars PPE, e) enacted Defense Protection Act ramped production PPE instead shaming people wearing N95 masks...

...we would situation now. even *start* sleep 4 quite spell there. ""Our customers dying travel us"".

Funny corporate arguments always favor making money regardless externalities. lol DonT seE rACe feels pretty much like lot dystopian sci fi I’ve read. dumber. administration ruined America! administration ruined America! Yep. Even half would good. Means average half people encounter immune. administration ruined America! 80s baby, concur. 90’s, shitty Macarena denim jackets were, grand old time. fondly remember sitting living room eating Dunkaroos, watching Legends Hidden Temple Saved Bell. Ahhhhhh... bullshit face I'm glad cares us. Even hospitals without covid suffering restricted visitation policies. families can’t even loved ones pass.

Funerals even different much difficult. Mathematically get confidence interval range fixed number participants whether around 50% 90% efficacy. stated reason (just article) able test diverse groups people underlying conditions.  upping number participants narrow confidence interval efficacy regardless. administration ruined America! ...and CDC telling people wear masks...  That's interpreted actually.

Wear mask = less exposure viral load less spread virus = people still get covid symptoms ""recover"" quicker = immunity population wide. many people florida died covid19 due full hospitals? Research shows average 2 weeks, rare recovery couple months people. Take care people asymptotic also breathe lower doses virus?  may blocked out, scary hell. lined us cafeteria nurse huge futuristic gun like thing stuck arms kids screaming crying stand forever listening shit go ahead you. Unless kind religious exemption, got school prior 1972.  enjoy experience? People get idea homeschoolers hole lock kids house away big bad world nothing like experience here. many groups outings etc. sit shut six hours.
I’m education still I’m totally govt schools homeschooling two fifth graders. get mad sometimes like brother got different kids different needs.
Plus younger energy one him. Sounds like good idea q see? thing worse believer nonsense, non American believer. People really stupid Maybe is. way think hoax (only idiot would) man definitely outlier. people age get sick enough hospitalised put ventilator.   parents realize kids get really scared someone gets sick. Even high school, governor shut schools last March, students really freaking out. taxing kids mentally. Prove I’m teacher start tomorrow. Wasn’t really terrified morning. Reality setting in. Wanna tell many stamps passport book many international teams worked with?   Yes, think everybody knows, also give shit. People bored now. 

Either literally bored, run money, inconvenienced, want get life. vulnerable need shelter, want to. That's reality - deal it. explanation death numbers 200k+ normal months pandemic US? Take rhetorical question know coherent explanation resort saying simply believe numbers like already said. 

People like deserve sympathy virus dies eventually wind way population feel shame moral obligation keep pain causes know played small part inflicting similar pain 200k people already died loved ones. ever forget know rest life morally reprehensible.  Interesting, like country actually cares you.

The Swedish model would've never worked US, much selfishness self entitlement. Snapmap city shows wall wall bars entry lines block, multiple large weddings, football parties houses bars. ever expect get this? don’t see way we’re fully year based everyone’s acting, although think part issue live. It’s strongly making consider moving North West over. parents push kids go back, long think they'll actually get work kid gets sent home quarantine every couple weeks? Yup too. everyone like that. grandmother used cry say want die.  everybody: severed brain stem, liquified etc... Wrong, I'm 57 got it. didnt stop giving smallpox vaccines US 1972. large gin like contraption multiple needles time hot left scar slightly smaller quarter upper arm. Smallpox eradicated worldwide 1980. See [Page 12 2020 ITUC Global Rights are, *obviously*, one worst 10 20 countries world workers rights violations — rank Rating 4 (""Systematic violations rights"") possible ""Rating 5+,"" representing complete breakdown legal processes protect workers rights whatsoever.

We're English-speaking nation low list lower, Fiji — unless count technicalities like Hong Kong, English official language spoken 4.3% population.

You'll notice *many* nondemocratic nations rated less-severe terms violations workers' rights.

It ridiculous say US ""pretty nice"" say ""one worst."" could always find worse situation, speaking *relative* situation, say, ""Things pretty nice"" workers US. relative statement would true, also entirely unhelpful unrepresentative comparison.

It would like saying ""Workers far better US Libya Sudan"" — yeah, shit. fatality rate alone 1%

It isn't. .06% saint know without doubt since long time Covid-19 like disease, long lasting immunity. r/askscience folks said many times, like article another nail coffin. Whilst members government consistently break rules get away it. Punish harshly forget it. MSU classes announced online weeks ago. source??? Yes no, pretty large generalization. mouth words songs headset people can't tell.

We tell. face still moves.   size quarter upper arm near shoulder. Well would mean UK, Oxford UK I'm presuming thats roughly meant... talk people immigrated work countries actual hellish work lives(like Japan) 

Actually wife Japanese passport. We're far behind worked many hours Japan bunch things like.

Americans weak work either... hell Japan totally unproductive even government acknowledges this. Unlike USA people's lives wasted busywork sitting desks pretending good.

Don't bother lecturing what's hard work done 72 hours straight hard labor broken bones. We're usually fucked yet we've definitely people would return could. going keep people pre-existing conditions home U.S. may well strict lockdowns.


Over 45% Americans form heart disease.
33% adult Americans considered obese.
9% Americans diabetes.
Over 7% adult Americans asthma.
5% Americans cancer survivors.
About 5% Covid-19 deaths U.S. ages 45 - 54
About 11% Covid-19 deaths U.S. 55 - 64






I'm sure many overlap, doubt do. said year? know still issue many population never did, still take seriously. still 'hoax'. again, blame people. South Koreans kicked thing right away. Since April, they've dealing contact tracing small outbreaks. 

We could done **exact** thing, started masks, testing, contact tracing, self forced quarantine, fines people going intentional super spreaders. guess what? We're still stumbling steps began.

 government failed. population failed. America failed.

I recall commenting vaccine solution. know not, hoax believers also anti-vaxxers. taking unless detained forced authorities. solution, people acting like fucking adults ending tantrums masks. 

Go ahead, downvote too. delusional apparently important facing reality. could prevented. 200,000+ dead, still acting like way life. not. forced powers be, cultist fervor mindset Republican voting base. I'm sad country many citizens braindead window lickers.

Edit: Big smiley face plebes downvoting comments. hard face reality, it? might partially fault, 'proud' admit it. Americans nationalism disgusting. like echo chambers, easy recognize. Okay yes phrase COVID. point wasn’t spark conversation COVID doesn’t matter think it’s real not. 

We focused news social media feeds us people ready Kill hurt even hate another person wearing mask. 

I typed lot different ideas line none conveyed idea wanted. fight among us end. got today together. comes labor time another person, person might opposite beliefs still helps you. 

That’s point guess, words time limit mess much truly convey opinion.

Edit put periods junk. kept vaccinating 1972 much later that. born 62 remember getting shot elementary school. got someone fired writing insane racist garbage Facebook. Screen shot it. small business wants BS following around. think celebs know going hit yet.

Movies never, mean NEVER coming back.

I chance buy NFL season tickets many dropping their's, said ""fuck it."" SW Ohio 50/50. Plenty people refuse wear one even though mask mandate. read yesterday, it’s experts opinion masks may providing immunity allowing small amount viral dose infect mask wearer. Enough don’t get sick still build immunity. interesting theory. Yeah unfortunately nothing done this. People content delivery curbside alone. think Russian? China far likely thinking thing read OP... Would actually explain numbers low Japan although people started going lot since quite early on... ""the government hiding it!!!!! Tatemae!!!!"" theories course. Luckily basically everyone wears mask. That, personally careful washing hands poking face mask on, goes long way think done learn shingles. come across kind hysteria psychotic state listen them.  find harder harder sympathy them, though, mental illness not. pretty obvious early days masks work, looking Chinese Koreans. born 1977 1983 (sometimes see 1985)? so, part generation. not, get share cool generation kept vaccinating smallpox us 1972. basically, us mask wearers microdosing covid. ready football? know mean that. I’ve happen far conspiracy road. Working Russia mid late 90s isn’t strongest evidence big claim. think that’s use per capita numbers, like cases per 100,000. South Dakota pretty badly right now, don’t look per capita numbers, number cases much lower Texas.

There certainly lot reasons (other Trump) Canada better... universal healthcare, strong leadership provinces, population personally responsible considers others, etc. Truth Lion Facebook swears masks kill people 5G waves made Bill Gates. torn. believe? ""researchers doctors"" Truth Lion? mean TRUTH name can't lying, he's lion! lion eat ten doctors least! WOOSH study Centers Disease Control Prevention examined close-contact exposures contributing spread virus, found adults tested positive COVID-19 twice likely reported eating restaurant within 14 days infection compared tested negative. I’m Central Ohio. There’s lot med research melting pot population assume plays (we get lot test market products). sure select individuals I’m healthy almost 40 don’t underlying conditions. asked health, prescriptions, covid risk factors, could get someone pregnant. doctor came cross examined signed it. didn’t feel like screening particularly strict. gotta take diary possible covid exposure symptoms every week tell stop. Even then. Herman Cain contracted tRumpy rally still saying it’s hoax. Multiple Repub Senators Representatives it. important thing slope; average infected person america passing less one person. average infected person netherlands passing one person. possible dutch careful? Whether wanted not... people would ""just wear mask"", problems now, would we?"" yet are. Spanish flu bubonic plague still around I’ve picked random date November 6/2021.. I’m hoping pandemic over. It’s 14 months now. honest, house bill far closer country needed Senate bill failed cloture.

The Republicans willing necessary know required left base wants that's good way kill support election. Please report dude protect others getting abused Empathy key. clear big percentage population none little. would venture say 62 million showed us almost 4 years ago. don’t *person* well noon. Lol family $2400 stimulus check summer. Two weeks later water heater went out. $1300 fix.  $1100, wife needed new glasses/contacts bastard insurance cover $800.  $300 remaining lighting fixture ballast panel went kitchen pay $150 get done. 

Now I've got $150 savings. still jobs extent, another stimulus check sure would nice. mildly mentioned Christmas last night told tree, lot things.  Whilst pubs restaurants allowed 30 people? Boris Johnson held meeting broke rules CummingsGate ofc. PM banging moral duty get kids back school regularly struggles social distancing. student fined 10k entire system nothing hypocrisy?


I see reddit still firmly high horse. Hilarious really. Must blind see theres slight injustice it. Remember early article (not great study) suggested opposite time masks short supply medical staff believe made call say help.

Which great, could focused shortage guess. Love group pic. Guy background mask Karen background mask nose taking selfie. Check username, too. almost guarantee he's daily stormer migrant trying spread division hate. Uses name shlomo reference obscure Jewish thinker like 11th century. may far right, neocon type. None people like provide anything like coherent explanation excess deaths 200k care to. essentially nazi type eugenics view (in terms intellectual coherence honesty-- though moral implications make wisely unwilling explicitly state views) died are/were weak/lesser/inferior, etc care deaths. 

This think bad faith arguments come from. Although others circus freaks believe qanonsense. Fuck troll Get sleep now, sister. Lol  tell divorce boom already here. years spend bit time reaching dads go custody battles order help using experience. wish someone done me. number dads desperate see kids skyrocketed past months. divorce boom already here. people reaching limit adhering increasingly nonsensical restrictions; example UK longer allowed meet groups 6 more, also demanded go back office help support cafes coffee shops. BS, know propaganda.

Looked Sweden Denmark, lower death rates, lockdowns masks. achieve immunity fastest save lives it. province seeing lot spread nightclubs banquet halls, got shut last week. Another rule came play bars restaurants music needed turned down. I’ve read stuff louder someone speaks viral load spewing. Makes sense bars restaurants turn music people quieter conversations, one people going bars restaurants. Also alcohol served past 10pm. Routine. Cats thrive it. 

We feed little guy smallish meals twice daily - 8 5 pm - routine seems work well him.

Love username. imagining tiny gorilla realized 800 oz dog-sized. Still cute though. Hahahahaha NYC reports daily antibody numbers. Average still Email work place. dont fucking care petty seams, reach employer via email screenshots everything ask allow person work business kind moral standards place. 

Fuck morons  state this? That's hilarious visual dad pancreatic cancer, actually died kidney failure first, organs shutting down, kidneys race see got kill him. death certificate lists hyperkalemia (potassium poisoning) cause death, pancreatic cancer underlying cause. issue putting cleaning. get pus needles, though? Exactly, limit contacts. People seem get that.

I realize hotels trying avoid walk-ins. makes sense.

Take care. Stay well. keep wearing blue surgical masks because

1) know they're extremely effective

2) Anyone might concerns also would know they're extremely effective

So kind way keeping safe reasonably also communicating anyone else I'm us.

If someone's wearing anything else, idea made kind help actually doing. nondescript fabric mask could anywhere blue surgical mask effectiveness, way holding thin t-shirt face effectiveness. need jump gun. wear mask. There’s downside accurate mental health impossibly unmanageable. I've started antidepressants that's...something? try stay distracted. another example Trump coordinating Putin hurt Americans. anti-mask/pro herd immunity idiots talk going lose fucking mind study becomes scientific fact. Washing hands also helps sauces. Nice likely fail vaccination. advanced western vaccine candidates unproven technology, completely ignored tried tested methods inactivated virus vaccines. Oxford vaccine almost went bin couple days ago. saying inactivated virus vaccines work, also many disadvantages, least try. Yoooo sshhhh let ccp psychops army hear you, r/Coronavirus. upvote positive news misinformation Xi.

Besides, Uyghurs slaves, they're simply reeducated combat religious extremism. Muslim dignitaries actually visit camps approve well Xi treats them! /s

All facts aside, Sinopharm's vaccine appears mostly safe inactivated virus, would really worry CanSino's one live attenuated vectored virus. People incredibly lazy.

I find hard believe many people would take time purchase materials make masks.

My evidence? Look people, currently, still won’t wear masks even though abundance evidence broadcasted circulated daily basis huge help easily accessible. Interesting. arguments support that? They're part system. rotten system cannot fundamentally changed degree people need remaining within said system's bounds following rules wish best. least they're trying, unlike Fuhrer.

Not control it, US along many countries solid candidates phase 3 trials.. office mostly working home still, except boss go twice week. walk sort warehouse area get part building, wears mask since people working there, said first times came mask literally laughing mocking her, none wore masks.

Yep, weeks later least two people heard ended getting sick stay home weeks. *still* wearing masks, crazy me. motive that? I'm totally going start wearing mask cold flu season hope others too. CDC stupid! cannot understand mentality. Fascinating link, thanks sharing  Covid overblown. I’m RN covid unit Florida.

If seriousness covid spectrum, low end trump calling hoax, high end CNN calling world ending plague everyday, it’s 2. plan along. Never tried avoid getting virus, reduce viral load. Yikes. Sorry hear that. Like you, work essential job never stopped working. PPE available first week April, two weeks non essential businesses closed here. 8 people ended getting it. 5 asymptomatic, 2 struggled breathe weeks recovered, one ventilator 3 months amputation. Even still I've occasionally report bad mask wearing occasionally N95 masks still $10 find them, need one even able breathe outside California right now.  wish gotten flu vaccine am, okay first virus killed everyone!

Repent sins alll die! genetics two viruses similar %, mean viruses exact same. even naming convention, would scientists name coronavirus caused SARS SARS-CoV 1, current novel coronavirus SARS-CoV 2? 

Furthermore, Bananas 96% similarity genetics human beings, mean bananas = human logic? 
Let's use even closer species-related argument. Domestic cats Tigers share roughly 95% genetics, gonna stupid say tigers cats?

So no, novel coronavirus causes different disease compared coronavirus causes SARS (the effects even different, logic viruses true, see big difference infectivity disease). Please stop talking like know scientists.  I've read, companies recently started fast-tracked phase III trials China granted emergency use outside trials they're complete. AstraZeneca, Pfizer, etc. vaccines administered outside fast-tracked phase III West? critique China low amount transmission could wait months results widespread use. wish gotten flu vaccine am, okay first virus killed everyone!

Repent sins alll die! side effects higher safety. 99.5% people recover getting virus, wearing mask makes better. need risk unknowable side effects injecting untested vaccines body. Thank you. That's disappointing, guess surprising. mean work bit different leisure stays visiting friends family. would prefer people travel unless absolutely to, people check bring towels too, people infected by, go home elderly mom, husband, 2 month old baby. But, also understand people work need pay bills buy food. lot people though walk reservation, tell excepting walk ins due COVID, say say ""Ok book online right I'm walk in,"" sigh say ""Yea technically guess not, but-"" say ""Ok hooked here's ID."" long propaganda Reddit agrees with, science matter. Yeah, sound like someone chooses one person's cherry picked response broader consensus. Nope. authority fallacy running redditor things, broader public health community thinks. anti mask people too. AFAIK every country difference many dealt with. 

My city plastered notices advice covid everywhere pharmacies grocery stores quickly installed plastic screens avoid infection clerk shopper. supermarkets hired security dude check nobody entered store without cart (to ensure social distancing) mask. helps general population oodles guns lying around. 

So antimaskers gather antimasking protest. Good expressing opinion way mostly hurts themselves. Reddit reddit. think give fuck human life

Well I'm seeing past 9 month:

CCP demonstrated willing destroy economy save people

GOP demostrated willing sacrifice people save economy

Seems like CCP indeed care human life? ruling party USA? Anyone knows masks, immune systems, viruses work, already knew this. study telling us anything new, demonstrating knowledge many us already had. People need ""shown"" fucking listen.

Vaccines literally small doses virus. Masks reduce size viral dose. Therefore masks = catching virus likely vaccination effect infection effect. Common fucking sense thank telling people god dammit I'm pissed people stupid. hoax?  funny claim post ignorant, proceed include citations make completely false 

Spain, UK, Italy higher ""deaths per millions"". Sweden below. I'm saying US done good, extremely reductionist place blame administration. effect coronavirus country caused thousands complex interacting factors.

""Bullshit effect would same. claim president encouraging cult ignore doctors instructions makes difference?""

How much difference though? see reason would affected people result much. factoring decisions specific Trump, shutting travel China early despite democrats calling racist xenophobe. 

""Clinton rapid action pandemic team place. would ignore things general would move fast contain. lied ignored way back February""

I see evidence Clinton would done better lied. would think pandemic response team would done better? think likely Clinton would lied prevent panic keep markets affloat close election. 

""America leading long time example tackle things.""

America tackled pandemic contagious coronavirus before. surprised many countries demonstrated data. coroanvirus deaths infection United States also specific states like New York California--perhaps blame governors situations. 

""Which trump leader. takes lot population completely ignorant even get here. Unless people brain washed thinking competent leaders matter, else play sideism?""

Blah blah blah rhetoric convince anyone. understand people think effective. Wow someone reddit said ignorant people brainwhashed, I'm convinced! Come one EVER convinced anyone kind statement. 

""imagine claiming straight face tht aneroca worst world even worse absolute third world country something prevented.""

Well per capita worst world, dozen countries worse per capita. also culture, society, legal system would enable Chinese style authoritarian lockdown quarantine would necessary stop spread COVID. Imagine Trump quarantined state New York California threat death, well imposed Chinese style martial law censorship. probably posting reddit orange hitler office, right ways. Clinton would faced exact problem. Maybe that's upcoming trend, Pandemic finally control :) things now.. wonder people like wearing them. /s part left right come together find solution? hahahahahahaha almost got It’s minor inconvenience lose business job. people clearly don’t pay bills live real world. Yep, global starvation doubled six Unfortunately that’s argument anti-maskers coming from. need specific talking way happens Covid-19. article big maybe. possible hopeful maybe! Sorry, imprecise. replace outside air rate causes entire air cabin replaced outside air multiple times hour.

There’s chance airplane experience “buildup infectious droplets confined space” kind transmission. still worry direct breath line someone, obviously Ah shit. Good thing I’m titan warlock Protect least.  allow country anyway?! Fear control. Natural Selection Well, smart. traveled work, know what? Back school, guess. sure yet. Ah, mean rates, mean total deaths. Well, can't argue there. relate quite bit slightly different way.

And also feel uneasy around people like everything know now, still choose mask on, know either incredibly stupid plain ignorant facts reality. such, I'm uneasy around can't trust them. freak vids people, suspicious consider danger around. sense mask on. Anectodes like make want continue mask even more, thank sharing it. get even worse then. Ackshully e-op-ed ill know! Don’t bother arguing troll. It’s probably teenager. I’m sorry Cuomo still putting guys hell reason. Indoor dining open weeks ago. CA can’t imagine. shortly after. homemade masks might cut healtcare workers. secure supplies panic buying began. made difficult national stockpile shenanigans Timestamp: listen he's actually saying he's anti-mask, said back March spreading aerosols n95 masks would effective CDC still saying spreading droplets. He's honest actual evidence right now. Nope. Feb 29 masks sold stores amazon. Two houses mine live couple seven kids. gatherings (inside) house twice week. No, wasn’t typo; two nights week. yet see person donning mask way out. neighbors walk head parties, get weirdest looks like I’m child scared boogeyman. I’m polite speak wave but, neighbors, acquaintances coincidence, friends. friends meet much less often, outside, masks, because, much like friendship, we’ll weather look back several years, glad chose set follow common sense boundaries.

Edit: sorry many, many words. felt good vent. fair approach went terribly came toilet paper, unless I'm missing something major, toilet paper life saving properties.

I kinda think government's decent read stupid species. Eh...good call. got mad. might think sounds sad, think actually disproved conclusion. 

You pretty eyes, therefore pretty. :) told truth. enabling teaching behavior ok. I'm side people like get idiots wasted shot. trying put next time please step rest us. Sucks point. interact people work tolerance non mask wearers. someone approaches without mask ask put on. one refused far. Yes. Especially unknowns point, due virus novel, options lie, risk Corona burning healthcare workers, would raise lethality dramatically. ugly choice, necessary one. Seems like listening doctors scientists usually leads right choices...  no, stats remove high risk people. that's actually overall rate, even though 60% 75. people ""at risk"" (whatever means, article written april) complications covid people ""at risk"" complications virus. real positive 8 weeks wearing masks work every day find I'm starting get much better reading peoples eyes tell smiling. Ive never fully comfortable eye contact, forcing comfort zone, Im noticing much context gained eyes.

Yeah it’s literally win win.  


1. People stay away me.
2. don’t hide psychopathic facial expressions conversations more.
3. already I’m science. Yep. guess people like. We're seeing 10s thousands deaths every 15 days - guys babbling about?? Risks life, one wants die car wreck drive work day. kind American would go traveling country global epicenter pandemic probably great person. numbers work then? 

Numbers lie. America care pandemic destroying country. charged hate crime? Clearly guy paying DGAF either. Eat home. whatever mental gymnastics want justify selfish choices certainly don’t “have to” sit inside restaurant put yourself, families servers risk. don’t watch YouTube videos offered sources. FYI.

I read source though doesn’t say think says. article presents data two models estimating daily infections England, deriving recent IFRs estimates 0.30% using MRC unit’s data 0.49% using ONS data.

Recent ifr.

Again using deaths say certain percentage exposure immunity likely.

This source argues England recent ifr certain rate take say all
The US numbers beginning agree estimate.

It’s apples oranges. 


This source supports IFR .3 .5 stated propaganda site did.


Frankly, propaganda site wouldn’t slice data dishonest ways sources supported position.

.5 .6 low end IFR estimates.

.6 1 pretty accepted. Nitpicking millions lives convenient argument? That's /r/Coronavirus Yes agree first vaccines won’t super effective, even 50 percent success rate hell lot better vaccine all. ... people refuse wear masks. That's fair. guess wrong used. still, average person gets COVID absolutely bone damage worry about. Lol stop

It still come anywhere near number source? *wraps self Canadian flag* often screw goddamn love Canada. THANK YOU. Thank kind words, largely agree. differ largely semantic concepts inference described different language different fields. I'm still totally fluent health yet, completely get saying.

I use coarse term observational distinguish research design experimental - there's intentional manipulation. Causal effects claim difference observed world counterfactual one get observe, whether observational design estimate difference depends plausible identification strategy. definitely ecological study, unit observation coarse (counties/states) unit behavior actually takes place (people).

If could waive wand, would individual level measurements people event, experimental manipulation went didn't. could literally comparison means test true difference infection rate due entirely attending Sturgis (to sampling approximation).

Keep individual level observation lose experimental manipulation, find identification strategy. need find people could plausibly gone Stugis reason. motorcycle broke wildfire shutdown highway, etc.

Baring identification strategy, we're trying model things predict going Sturgis pairing people went assuming good job predicting (some propensity matching scheme).

Baring we're garbage regressions matching people based covariates may may good job predicting attending.

Then lose unit analysis, unable measure people, measuring entire locations. go far call straight fallacy, Bayesian sense happens larger location provide information people within. fallacious depends much information trying squeeze kind. (e.g. Wenxin Jiang, Gary King, Allen Schmaltz, Martin A. Tanner. 2019. “Ecological Regression Partial Identification.” single step path means needing data making assumptions able say less less. really important problems like COVID pandemic even reasonable guesses might useful, work big confidence intervals might still totally worth it.

The problem people realize many intermediate steps assumptions mention much less document test them. team certainly doesn't.

And that's even get fact they're even measuring dependent variable say (infections), they're excluding useful information could helped help story (deaths), near able make careful ecological inferences sparse info. trendy right mistrust vaccines... there's hurdle  Large minorities subcontinent SE Asia South Africa too. Same, theres long remain mentally healthy, value much physical health  Yeah didn’t outdoor seating available/was family. safe. 

I’m 35 fiancé 25. don’t go bars anymore, don’t go much really anyway store (mask up) hang handful friends. Smart. Wish could grow food ""So 600 per 100,000 cases?"" outcome 100,000 cases determine yet. They're still active. 

Once someone diagnosed covid, there's delay time hospitalization hospitalization death. Normally, cases spike, take 3-4 weeks deaths catch up. 

So final outcome spike cases past week yet determined. Nevertheless, Spain France see deaths pick October. Even majority cases younger cohort, infections still spill vulnerable populations. saw happen sunbelt, specifically Florida, Texas Arizona. initial surge cases stayed younger population first, eventually made way older, vulnerable populations. deaths case spikes July still happening now.

Well, fauci keep saying shit without assistance federal state try minimize outbreak, living like normal especially ones like (thankfully didnt lose job) work 50 hours week pay Bill's shit. 

Trust I'm Fauci words drowned millions act like normal survive thought Santa Clara achieved herd immunity...you know....the Stanford study? Oh wait. Early bird catches COVID. 6.4 million confirmed cases, 60 million. want pull estimates confirmed, probably add excess death numbers U.S. since March confirmed death toll, puts us closer 400,000 dead. Yea double blind meant ensure blinding effective. double blind people administering treatment also don’t know can’t affect behaviour participants unwittingly otherwise. Bails partially determined flight risk.  thought could run disappear posting bail, would something absolutely impossible post. probably $30k right getting media attention lawyer may try take case. local trailer-park moron, bail $5k\~ may set. “Had to” lmao inject yet? Sounds accurate. suggesting lockdowns contribute economy suffering? think lockdowns keep virus spreading? one without other? penetration low kill outer epidermis layer, happens outer epidermis already dead, can't kill already dead.

What dead may never die. pretend aren’t trending better everyone believes that, change behavior stop trending better.

It’s like running cliff. long don’t look can’t fall live 90's. like compared now? Nobody comment section opened link.

Misleading clickbait title.

Propaganda working 100%.

FYI: North Korea issues shoot-to-kill orders anyone entering country illegally, mainly China. least vote. 100%.... best mix technology human interaction Sir, please calm down. Wendy’s. I'm going attempt defend Cummings. 

But 50 person house party middle lockdown pandemic whose spread primarily seems linked large gatherings taking different level. many tests today? What's R? deeply secrecy mode, heard much figures looked good. Well countries. it’s enough cases. Spanish economy knees. Give us time, we'll catch up. left letting experts decide know fair use countries already brink starvation.. Anything would tipped scales badly them, world pandemic not. average teachers Ontario make 100k, benefits, 2 months year yet every election teachers onion hold parents hostage strikes increase pay. might Canadian thing, little sympathy teachers complaining jobs great job here. There's always complaints class size Asia classes easily 50-100 students one teacher. 

Yes there's risk covid grocery workers, healthcare workers also face risk often less pay. Oh didn’t know protest article BLM protest... bad. would apply Italy? thought difference virus itself, “strain” hit NYC well. Fauci actually. first said masks needed population large could detrimental fact. Couple months later said said lack PPE medical professionals. Either lied one point give us complete picture. not? go back old days wiped butts leaves fingers. Planet survive, going huge mass extinction event. wipeout civilization. might even inclined think elites preserve technology themselves. Haha, made day!  Except quite simple, yes, agree.

You get unlucky breath ONE droplet enough viral particles make sick. could even breathe 10 feet away someone. (Singing? Yelling?) Get super unlucky, someone 2 minutes ago coughing elevator may give you.

So breath spoken word/phrase infected person may throw raw virus, virus laden droplets air, Yes, need get certain number sick, higher dosage often leads worse outcome, possible people almost matrix-style dodge nasty stuff get sick 60 minutes they're bar drinking couple beers.

But hang longer drink four beers, watch 3h sports event everyone yells TV's.... luck likely run out. understand people... That's point consequences. They're supposed deter something. pay heed, faces consequences. talking ""in future every confidence worldbeating blahblah"" proved wrong yet. PM feeling way day day, say literally anything today another day power deal tomorrow tomorrow. nothing strategic. also used enjoy them, though honestly believe vast majority conspiracy theories heard. 19-year-old cousin got super conspiracy theories shortly total mental breakdown diagnosed schizoeffective disorder. became totally different person--destructive, violent, threatening murder parents brother. Today he's homeless jail. surprised least ends dead he's 40.

It started belief conspiracy theories. see people get lost bizarre theories, first thought likely seriously mentally ill need treatment. How/why many Americans extra-susceptible believing absolute nonsense, understand. scary hell. Yeah shit Uhhhh, it’s obvious I’m implying state hormones young people considered unique influence. Also, people say hormones effecting going pregnancy, “the pregnancy making hormones rage”, example, it’s obvious they’re implying hormonal balance pregnant woman different pregnant women hormones. Like c’mon, it’s hard understand. example catastrophic thinking, jump straight worst outcome. It’s also black white thinking options “work risk death” “quit starve homeless.”

Creativity reason species adaptable. see two possible choices, course look terrible. many ways adapt. one size fits solution. live midstate urban area. Compliance widely varies, half assed compliance common. serious mocking occasion daring mask (scoff, scoff!) keep distant. think we, Dr. Mike Osterholm said repeatedly, need kind reassure going last forever get this. gave teaching career forcing coach additional pay. think matters lives could saved?

these ""essential"" industries could implemented safer work environments, didn't. lives lost. meat packing companies given fine amounts slap wrist. 

but big deal, right? Yes 50% number plucked thin air.

No one knows (including authors article) Herd Immunity Threshold really is. one thing, one Herd Immunity Threshold. differs different places. another, read text, literally picking number feels right (""little evidence that"" ... well, evidence that, either). acknowledge idea quantify effect heterogeneity HIT (no one does) know quantify heterogeneity (in text, use phrase ""it remains difficult quantify impact phenomenon ..."" accurate, proceed minimize it.) also spend fair bit time using 1-1/R0 formula HIT, simply right, assumes away heterogeneity susceptibility. suggest ""special situations"" might allow natural reduction HIT prevalence. disingenuous way talk heterogeneity, meant make seem less important, actually important part HIT equation. ""special case,"" much part HIT calculation transmission rate, one know estimate well. Finally, pointed whole discussion comes math falls one epidemiological model 100 years old. may accurate.

This feels like piece written specific socio-political purpose. They're afraid talk -- including qualified scientists -- HIT 20's 30's even lower adversely affect peoples' compliance distancing masking rest. I'm sure they're right (I think may exactly wrong, case dabble mass psychology that's area expertise). clearly know holding 60-70% HIT estimate viable longer. world class test trace according hancock can’t serious.. cite made mortality factor deciding issue? death matters you, outrage 200,000 deaths

The businesses fault even government fined them. Yeah Cummings actually corona virus time significantly worse. also travelled across country area high infection area low infection. mention lied police public cover up. Shocker. flew back vacation March 11th. known going go happen next day, would’ve never come back sick since March, last time fought virus 6 months?

Now, even rules place, like 80% even among employees. 50-60% actually covering noses wearing paper thin bandannas. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things start getting better...

So people start going wearing masks less...

And things spike like crazy...

If people cautious Yellow Zone Red Zone virus would've gone back May...

But start cycle spiking finish previous spike...

Wash, Rinse, Repeat vaccine good efficacy/safety widespread usage able force stronger idiots...

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, keep getting increasingly better treatments understanding helps prevent serious consequences. So, hopefully idiots make cases spike keep deaths minimum. Nope. He's gonna learn hard lesson example others might thinking did. first wave peaked 14 weeks ago. second wave.

It doesnt match up. middle July already significant spike cases. August 20 ""topped out"".

There matching rise genuinely hope best all. smart move wish badly U.S would done would thing. Best yours. OK, let's discuss fatality rate then. computing 1%? Good. send message time take thing seriously again. He's unlucky idiot got made example of. experience, house parties *can* happen spontaneously, it’s typically night town something. Nobody meeting large groups friends town atm. party 100% planned it’s fault. point late. done like Europe beginning would least summer respite. Europe second wave now, functioning testing tracing system, they'll probably avoid anything like spring. Outside northeast, really system place here. really know we're going fall winter. already widespread, contact tracing workable even wanted it. That's humanity operates, unfortunately. really sad, brains still stupid, going kill that. Yeah mother died respiratory failure. stage 4 lung cancer coincidentally diagnosed certainly 35 years chain smoking knew harmless anyway wasn’t chain smoker sometimes lit cigarette hand, everyone exaggerated that. coffee shops. sufficient contact tracing, every Starbucks would closed month sentence ""too many people here, party everybody out"" exist what?  humans species survive

I sure IFR 65 maybe 1-2%, 80 around 20%. keep underestimating age dependence.

The average age COVID deaths UK far 80, western countries. US extreme obesity problem bit lower.

And using absolute numbers, meaningless?  Rudy proves one Trump’s coronies. China unleash? Damn never thought would jealous something like American certainly am.  Yes floor made floor can’t vote bad away

The time come disobey makes great deal sense. height research HIV scientists discovered cohort prostitutes African city (I can't recall city now, many years since read paper) showed immunity HIV. much research cohort hypothesized prostitutes gained immunity due repeatedly exposed small viral loads, enough induce immune response. cohorts African prostitutes later found doctors speculated gained immunity mechanism. shit! aerosol borne virus! someone works around dangerous aerosols, contain explicit warning eat, drink, smoke presence.  know many times I've downvoted Reddit shouted since beginning pandemic pointing fact. France clocking 15 deaths/day 

the US 1,000 deaths/day recently 700/day number likely go 

so right bad. talk deaths 100/day Yeah, better use which, ironically, basically 100 years date. people planet still alive too! That's interesting aspect. many outbreaks meat factories. Also Europe. Could workers infected cowas, pigs chickens? Seems like number infected see difference virus damages brain cells. I'm line now. much political involvement.  live Israel. definitely excited hopefully time around works. 3 major Jewish holidays coming starting friday last 3 weeks anyways people vacation mode still sucks. Ha biggest misconception going. First all, teachers typically paid 10-month employees depending districts’ calendars. no, paid long summer break. top that, teachers spend summer working, developing curriculum, preparing upcoming school year. add fact many teachers pay pockets supplies. I’m sick bullshit narrative. Go spend month two public school see it’s like. Yes. clearly states Jo Platt Labour MP doctor cases started rising July. matching rise deaths. Yaaaaaaa also possible Sweden lockdown, due old laws. lung heart damage, virus gone, lifelong? notice difference recovery? opinion, regardless coronavirus, every death devastates family. talking about? I’m COVID denier? deaths specific causes mean deaths.

I think besides Covid, would death. otherwise. major things get seen thrown around reasons less death shutdown, like fewer workplace accidents, fewer traffic accidents either true people think (traffic accident rates per mile drive went pandemic, washing gains driving fewer miles) and/or weren’t major causes death begin with. hand, heart disease up, cancer issue, treatments screenings weren’t done timely. way larger causes death baseline things improved bit. It’s embarrassing American anymore. wasn’t already pretty embarrassed this. increased exponentially right alongside Covid. 6 months enough know ""short term"" nolonger question long term damage. question much long term damage. Title: Europe  
 
Comments: US, Trump, USA 

Me: Ahh shit, go again. wow scientists must done obvious. oh wait...

""""We assessed activities,"" added, ""such shopping, gatherings home, using public transportation, going office setting, salon, gym, church religious gathering, find differences adults without COVID-19."""" Exactly, it’s correlation. could well say people leave house often likely catch Covid. Nice 180 trying pull here.

I pretty sure elderly populaton(i.e people extreme risk Corona virus) includes people 65 people 80.Keeping mind,we safely conclude India(139,166,661 13.5% total population) higher elderly population US(55,939,448 16.9% total population US).What point again?

Again cherry picking facts suit narrative. Thank god live New England. feels like different country entirely rest US right now. Since Spanish Flu 1918 actually. bubonic plague occurred circa 1347-52. mention specifically want outdoor teacher. Hiking, ecology, botany, horticulture, animal behavior, outdooring skills, wilderness survival, conservation; stuff like that. Kids learn much moving.

No offense I’ve never seen public schools course Yes real crux issue. Schools US serve generally free cheap childcare depending look it. Without schools open, many people can’t continue work. there’s top leadership helping provide necessities broad rent/mortgage relief income protection, folks choice push send kids back. Completely agree, would appear average pub poses less risk non socially distanced private gathering based data UK Right feel that, prevented stores owners/managers putting big boy pants removing said customers property. Hell, stop entering begin with. 

It’s perfectly legal deny someone entry mask. See: shirt, shoes, service. thing applies here.  He's going *lot* chores get enough allowance pay fine. 8 covid listed death certificate /s. I'm you! 300,000 deaths point totally shut down. since 200,000, gotta open things back up. YOLO! Others saying better originally going type. 

There's major difference softening blow victim count (which know right away anyways) mentioning breach slurry wall still good weather, lying in-coming on-going pandemic properly protect ones self. inability redeploy $20 trillion resources damage. agree Cummings got away breach, little different organising 50 person house party. Key words ""per day"" infers linearity, assuming R number 1. Hi all. I've 100% lockdown since March beginning lose it. friends want go OBX days. safety measures would follows:

1. Get Tested
2. Quarantine completely 2-4 days 
3. Go beach trip
4. Come back get tested day seeing family 

Does seem sound/safe? something else could that's safer? someone says go, would literal **ONLY** social interaction half year, please dick. Yea kinda threw number there. remember initial reports 85% didn’t require hospitalization, 15% hospitalized 5% went ICU. Nah private gatherings homes driving infection UK. circulating mostly young people following guidelines much older people, also death rates low. risk virus transfers young people older people care homes example Belgium numbers substantially higher per capita. long term plan going teaching year high need them. exposure level right par walking covid ward. 

I mention specifically want outdoor teacher. Hiking, ecology, botany, horticulture, animal behavior, outdooring skills, wilderness survival, conservation; stuff like that. Kids learn much moving. name COVID-19, support message. We're investing lateral flow tests essentially pregnancy style tests done home. longer lockdown lasts people’s resilience continue compliance erodes

Sure, good reminder desire comply might erode, law not. 

As side note, whether something understandable sympathetic varies person person. no, ""understandable"" people getting tired throwing parties.

Absolutely zero sympathy. Regardless even one new case came kid deserves least maximum sentence. oddities heavily flawed retracted early study unusual structural changes heart. findings could replicated, there’s adequate reason worry. However, it’s unlikely replicated. god stupid feel like that's wishful thinking good luck herbal remedy Coronavirus. used love dining grabbing drink, can’t imagine I’d even able enjoy right now.

Honestly, people say ""they dying things"" actually understand willfully ignorant. tried talking someone comorbidity way heads. Time escape New Zealand/Taiwan/Singapore/SK, fuck country using political excuses play virus. Yep. According them, part ""liberal socialist agenda"". 

Shit's irritating. laugh, might never stop weeping. suggest name change: NemaKnowsALot Atlanta here. Basically same. large metropolitan/suburb area it’s pretty clear mile mile, go past 20 miles less care virus. It’s probably safe say get conservative culture, it’s probably mixed bag. I’ve definitely noticed it’s also different every race. Blacks good compliant this. Whites no. Hispanics no. Indians Asians yes. experience Georgia recently saw northern Florida well. Many won’t take serious hits home. It’s like cancer; don’t give cancer thought someone close gets cancer. enough people volunteer completely untested drugs, there's huge ethical concerns potentially killing people. animals used middle step vitro(Petri dish) tests human trials. animals severe reaction drug know give humans.

Testing animals ethically murky there's checks even animal stage, considered ethical skipping straight human trials. plandemic, one. real, planned "" live exercise"" dear God live someone believes even though beliefs contradict others. used J.F.K conspiracy person. board crazy train. ""Boys boys""? Canada - I'm wondering even trust numbers. whole pandemic response US political effort, rather public health response. 

I reached MP Covid stats rerouted CDC say possible determine safe reopen border anymore. Reopening border wait there's competent leadership US treats pandemic public health emergency. Deaths per million Sweden 578, US 598. However, two countries different it’s impossible compare. however fair compare Sweden Scandinavian countries, faired significantly better; Norway example 49 deaths per 1M pop. 

It’s also worth mentioning Sweden didn’t full lockdown mean didn’t restrictions. Also, Scands practising social distancing long COVID... Subscribe! New Mexico Facts!  much lower fine societal impact might cause one person gets seriously ill hospitalised. Midwest teacher 9-12 here. We're back person limited mask use social distancing. students staff cases, told keep quiet freak people (sound familiar? 🙄).

We need shut way many teachers get can't get coverage. basically they're fine half school run subs kids get bring home even staff potentially dying. think realize much money spend trying keep shape, eat better, taking care cardiovascular disease. pretty much entire life. feel strange anyone else 9/11? read dozens posts remembering lives lost day, however none people even acknowledged nearly 200,000 lost year COVID-19.  Many people mocking NY went March/April, making jokes Cuomo etc. 200,000 dead single pathogen 7 months acceptable, however many seem okay numbers. writing much else beyond said. There's thing nuance conversation instead seeing something, getting excited, flinging insults.

What implying quite many issues anti-science crowd get conflicted statements various leaders. People knew giving advice early would lead conspiracies illogical responses later, that's happens every time there's intentional mishandling miscommunication facts beginning crisis.

Good luck whatever anger/depression/projection issues going on. Hopefully eventually find peace eventually hurt around you. Yes, also see deleted/removed comment.  need job science research I'm choosy. There's shortage monkeys? Could fooled people watch Faux news. cousin lost wife's mother Covid still posting hoax stop Rump. 26 years education me, agree. There's complete lack respect K-12 educators entire career. literally earn one-third husband, works corporate, does, amount education experience field his. work harder educating online ever classroom- we've session week I'm exhausted- still tons people around say teachers lazy. son teenager, I've told several times advise make education career- lack money lack respect, combined much work outside school hours, make worth people starting field now. 

It's going become real problem next several years, think we're going see lot states normally high standards far education level required teach actually lower standards able attract people actual qualifications need. Indeed, need look outside US find reliable statistics; wanted meaningful figures look UK although again, making direct comparison might possible (i.e. differences health care models demographics). I've met people care believe others lost family. cousin also husband never wore mask around didn’t get either. prove masks don’t work?

Look, one thing know fact masks help protect OTHERS nasty germs, yourself— everything else pure speculation. really hope so. least 20% New York City already it, neighborhoods already reached herd immunity. new epidemic tri state area probably slow pretty quickly. I'm super familiar rest northeast know prevalent spring. California think could one rolling wave. lead country cases, we're state 40 million people. strict mitigation bay area, they're still extremely susceptible, even Central Valley pretty bad, we're nowhere near herd immunity, people growing tired masks social distancing. british raj definitly did.... didn’t know mask would help beginning weren’t paying attention.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really education issue, although people keep saying is. I'm HR manager retail supermarket poor, uneducated area employees customers phenomenal pandemic. incidents rejection policy denial (few customers refusing wear mask, etc).

We also special needs associates feel public duty wear mask protect others.

I personally dislike rhetoric ""it's stupid people."" IMHO personal attitude temperament, rejecting COVID science policies leaning narcissism arrogance. society emphasizes individual exceptionalism point people feel empowered challenge scientific determinations subjective measurements (in minds) equivalent greater significance.

There's lot otherwise intelligent people wrong side pandemic. year's virus vaccine help protect H1N1 H2N3, 2 nastier influenza viruses there. lowering chance getting those, lessen chance getting symptoms could mistake COVID, COVID influenza tag team body.

Many colds actually several viruses once. may influenza, adenovirus, coronavirus once. 

While unpleasant, uncommon cold strain, like COVID mixed quite dangerous. really believe Belarus numbers ? 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 far tell, don’t measure degree inflammation study. However, based concerns heard scientists first COVID-cardiology studies published, don’t think degree inflammation concerning statistic.  Well least chance protect catching virus good hygiene etc, also highly likely survive illness well. lockdown choice. break law starve watch family starve. awful really... political parties America school, GOP would special ed class. sure? ww1 generation lot anti mask protesters. One reasons possibly anything schools opening up. right? health crisis suffering first? Imagine exposing covid lot young people tell families person responsible got 500 pound fine.

Hilariously depressing.  Money grab I've started, good fellow. wonder would happen couldn’t pay front.
Good know twats like can’t slip using excuse. point last months, mother got call grandmother, said ""well, know anyone that's gotten it. Minus (my name here),"" like, me, count something. mother's exhusband still believes hoax, worships ground trump walks on.

Imagine professional vocalist, deciding perform now, developing lung scarring despite asymptomatic infection? Imagine damaging vocal cords coughing much. 

Capitalism greed poisoned America. country whole failed marshmallow test. I'd suggest research blindly spreading false information. takes 15 seconds Indeed. like UK, Spain, France - everything ok till wasn't. What? never see people without masks I’m California 🧐 really need promote gatherings protests mask optional peace equality protests instead anti-lockdown anti-mask, one make fuss. Sadly US always problem individualism praised collectivism. It’s lot ‘how affect me?’ rather ‘how affect community whole’. pandemic spotlighted toxic individualism mindset really times like this. look countries collectivism outlook, they’re much better much farther progression returning somewhat normal. 70% statistics made up, truly know?

No, people led believe mountain lies. perhaps people 'know whats up' - intentionally want people suffer, encourage mountain lies -- hoping people suffer -- people like this, thinking highly themselves, see someone else another person, friend help see truth.

So people really dense, prideful, ignorant, unfriendly -- need actually make effort help people out, least prideful ignorant.

Dispel lies, pride, wishing people death hoping suffer. never get better world always looking someone else, need actually reach show better way.

Shocker alert shocker alert would've thought understand given. like infection rates, virus reproduction rates people exponential - curve are, closing rate exploding. would think lower viral loads would give body time mount response.

That said real problem people who've decided viewpoint obsess X moved (totally illogical unscientific) regurgitate half-truths. Part say might true, conclusion draw wrong. So, saying BLM crowds socially distanced safe, restaurant dining *also* socially distanced also masked *is* safe. So, opposite reality. actually saying group like safe, group *do* like safe, even though they're thing (and one masked one isn't). Got it. also send money Qan#n guy? sound like need help. Best luck.

Keep wearing masks. listen imbecile anti-maskers. ;)

Have little doubt asked Chinese officials would confirm Trump's handling pandemic greatly exacerbated outbreak US.

This slipperiest slopes comes fines. might jump lane kill school bus full children 5mph limit, fine speeding life prison $1,000,00 fine. 

I agree idiot story fault(and also fucking moron). $10,000 fine equally stupid. someone immediate family. Nothing say make difference.

Even family get it, still deny it. really mass hysteria point. Good hear. It’s derived 2003 vaccine wasn’t fully developed it’s nice see it’s well potentially help pandemic. even close catastrophic scenarios told back March. 2 million people dead. hospitals overflowing.

Those predictions would happen take action. took strong action, strong enough IMO. one dust settles. Hopefully one pays tribute everyone died this. 

It's hard think way represent already 200,000 honoring healthcare workers cared many. invision cemetery like Arlington unmarked grave every death surrounded pillars healthcare worker lost.

Maybe giant visual reminder remind complacent next time, history taught us another. reopened schools May 17th. saw massive resurgence cases surpassed initial peak July.

The US looking it’s future. first peak bad specifically schools open happened? We’ve become safer schools first closed now. know constant cleaning disinfecting performative safety since it’s airborne. Masks make enormous difference, strict compliance difficult achieve. £60 billion cost furlough? Jesus Christ :( learned trust fascist leaders.. Years COVID developed post-viral gastroparesis IBS. It’s mostly noticeable anymore plagued years. Nana Plaza?  Tenet amazing. I’m 35. Unfortunately many futures looking grim right now. Hang there. Sure, project personal decision everyone else, reddit loves do. There's many people take anything Fauci says Oracle Science™, insane. That's Wuhan bad. know coming. 

Solving 80% problem lot easier last 20%. additional death prevented takes bigger effort cost one it. take extremes, could prevent infections closed grocery stores, doctors offices public transportation.  

The cost far children behind distance learning. Children behind social skills. high unemployment. Many businesses shut forever. jobs lost long past time back normal. federal deficit trillions higher. eventually foreclosures, moratoriums end. higher rates mental health problems substance abuse. Children adults likely suffering higher levels abuse isolated. Dangerous criminals let go either add prison populations let prisoners out. Elderly people isolated. Dental work put off. continue think it. Sure could more, think say made lot sacrifices. do, worse consequences. im interested b2b sales. advice places go apply? im teacher assistant trying get mess too. No. saying misleading, misinformed, both. majority people existing data set tested positive elderly. imply overall death rate somehow lower stated disparity rates age groups incorrect.

While general underlying concept valid, accurate way stating would say OVERALL death rate 3 percent disparity rates per age. mitigating factor already baked numbers, way diminish overall aggregate death rate.

While I'm sure mean well suggesting taking nearly half population locking magical island, ignoring logistical absurdity splitting families guardians left behind, precisely lower half age segment aggressive spreading, still completely ignoring ""herd immunity"" literally another way saying many people infected virus trouble finding new victims.

There ""immunity"" herd immunity. like ""hive mind"" ""group consciousness"" concept implies actual supernatural phenomenon transcends individual.

It bizarre phenomenon people feel better things put name them, taking solace death millions call ""herd immunity"" may worst example I've ever seen. figures cited White House imply seven figure death toll pixie dust kicks in, yet there's shortage people asking ""are yet"" like kids trip Disney World.

There phenomenon closed system exponential growth longer sustained. reason pipe dream Amway 2 people getting 2 people ad nauseum hold real world short order, planet would new suckers. saturated market becomes, harder find new willing participants.

And yet 60+ years later new people joining every day, Betsy DeVos needing hire full time yacht scheduler keep track fleet vessels foreign registrations avoid contributing anything whatsoever society lives. People duped believing ""herd immunity"" means something simply not. might well saying we'll ok hit ""market saturation.""

Millions dead reach point virus continues spread, prevalent longer possible sustain exponential growth quite literally opposite plan. miss concerts. 

I go see movie friend last week, tenet. went Wednesday brought cleaning wipes, wore face masks, theatre Seats 500 people, maybe 9 people auditorium. non pharmacy / grocery store outing, aside exercise, either us done, felt relatively okay risk level, honesty, really needed human interaction, escape reality like movies. Yes. US government admitted lying  never get people wear now. They’ve lied government admitted lying, time trust institutions time low. 

I understand people US don’t trust government. doesn’t line science, obviously, I’m saying understand. Olympic Games without spectators? People like still denying causes problems short term. 'Open back up!' 'No new shutdown!' right? 

Ponder moment told hated America I'm glad many Americans take virus seriously would stop think opinion all? hope wouldn't.

Edit typo I've happily worn mask religiously since March itdnoy difficult hurt anyone 

Fr. I've saying, wearing mask likely save life dog I'd gladly it, let alone lives fellow human beings! boggles mind too. Yay whataboutism He's bragging. Also lot deaths came early covid Innocent people already executed accident people already jailed nearly whole lives drug charges. Brain maturity 25 ish. ur brain, ie you, “fully grown.”  reading/video watching lockdown enforced. Many died sheer exhaustion starvation conditions thrust upon without warning. Covid spread prolifically anyways wasn’t competently executed, brutal draconian was. common consensus? I’ve never seen expert (actual scientists researchers) claim CFR accurate measure covid’s lethality - contrary, use IFR knowledge. 

If I’ve somehow missed consensus, I’d love know. recommend sources/links demonstrate common consensus using CFR IFR? I’d really appreciate that, thank you!  That's comparing apples oranges though - believe US Government's 2.2 Trillion lot support individuals directly cash payments - everything loans bailouts companies (which fairness help employees indirectly) direct costs pandemic public services. overall cost UK government doubt much higher £60 billion roll bailouts, additional benefit payments, tax reliefs NHS public service costs. ""coincidentally"" true many traditionally female careers. logic achieved 0 death AIDS. Congrats! Like you’d know either way oh wow thats enough barely pass poverty line individual! fucking idiot fuck still talking? Get notifications People die AIDS, either. shit immune response usually death-causing. opportunistic diseases are. Wuhan, clear data, lines relatives collect urns, welding doors, suicides, pool parties that. Blade 2020 Ok. people eat healthier foods like veggies less destructive planet. Health safety priority. find hard believe situation would anything except ""the worst, self centered people eating restaurants.""

If truly care people, well-being, going eat restaurant. all.

The people give shit people, want waited on, they're people going en masse. months waited on, think god-given right waited on, exact manner want, ""fuck everyone else."" Completely incorrect. EU deaths fraction March. US holding steady 1000 per day. 6 person limit work? 6 people live home. Would violation? could residents home plus 6 more? fine add additional community service attendees test positive.... 👍 20 year old here, life work sleep repeat last 6 months I'm ready 6 more. Though live old lady motivation me. I'm working lab COVID testing, I've many labs used PCR that. additional cycle takes like 2.5mins something (the old bio joke cycle sample length lunch break!). Would lowering number cycles result faster tests? marginally, would definitely result missed cases. 

(As aside--we want find *all* positive cases, currently infectious. matters estimating community spread, Rnaught, allows us proceed abundance caution.) probably realized that. Hopefully killed dog least. Alot us computer geeks, held bunkers 18. Honestly would loved it. WoW subscription stay home? Fuck yes. 

So yes, slightly bias group asking here. Lol can’t serious...

Are 55 year old heart disease misinformed? TL;DR type gets allergies, likely allergies, start August. helpful article. killed mostly people year two death old age? get mad Mother Nature?

Hey look, made numbers, completely unsupported evidence. seen knack that. saying objectively false. I've done friends July we're two weeks. worked us. also I've family members eat in-door dining every week, get manicures, party friends indoor regularly, etc. none gotten virus either - hard cautious see many throwing caution wind months fine. right. terrible. need everything fight it. I'm saying good better treatments months ago. Hopefully keep deaths spiking much cases do. fans arent allowed attend football events, theyre not. Nothing say adding content. ever college? Use rednecks Connecticut indoor dining gyms open since June 18th. Cases gone there. safe not? anyone truly kind, actually cares well people, eating (indoor outdoor) anytime soon. literally nothing since cases skyrocketing Yeah human life precious unless womb everyone knows that! /s physical sports like Soccer generally pretty well far infections concerned think Jo Platt's experience represents experience everybody else?

Do see trying change question answer last question made look like asshole?  No. made numbers based anything. Including stated fatality rate is. disproved nothing spouting ignorant lies. Huge? wonder many people could die bs stunt.

Having solely pay money potentially killing people good outcome perpetrator. 1-2 nights little sleeo food fork place mouth. telling there's chance inhaling particles food? mean 100%safe munch stranger's ass? government, pull wages. 7 day rolling average deaths states together danger crossing 4. get from? nowhere article.

But extreme people scared leave house too. There’s lot nut jobs too. strong symtoms? say mask wearing easier deal with. true you? do?

Not go place people gather unnecessary reasons. need eat, yes, need go somewhere served. least big 10 cancelled season Yes, completely agree - nothing would devastating bear thinking about. no-brainer. Either way cost eye-watering, though. That’s bad faith argument know lol much is. politicized FDA CDC, pushed conspiracy theories facts scientists stated used right wing cult that's built since Nixon via Fox News political action benefit billionaires everyone else. would taken exactly zero effort let CDC FDA handle things way touch them. Instead utilized 24/7 propaganda network push people deny science reality leading countless deaths, Sturgis Rally multiple weddings point.

The HEAD NATION came said that:

* Masks work.
* feelings Reality.
* dead hoaxes real.
* virus enemy plot China real.
* government infallible failure response minority party.

Just like 9/11, like Vietnam War, Trump could acted actually prevented national tragedy chose alternative benefits more. Trump gave megaphone insane, crazy fucks we're supposed blame it?

EDIT: Let also say Trump WHOLE PROBLEM, he's main one Covid, admin direct charge response. Recycling solve issue. raw materials. That's easy get by, usually. production parts need. packaging commodity business, margins low one keep production facilities unused. People try run lines close 100% time. Short spikes usually buffered longer shifts renting capacity companies lower load.

With Covid, problem suddenly large parts industry saw spike production need.Tthere enough capacity available. Yeah, it’s fact tests operating 30% false negative long time Ewww okay, they’re actually worse U.S. states. Wtf? Fuck everything mindset. Yes, would 100% followed orders 18, anyone simply asshole. even fucking difficult, parties fucking end world, nothing difficult it. fucking asshole trying defend behavior all. can’t claim science go stuff based reality.

/r/coronavirus: ""Challenge Accepted"" I’m glad that, US, won’t see second wave.... first wave refuses end, we’re good. parents take financial hit him, kind people deserve financial hit. Eating taxpayers' expense somehow ""help out"", worry. best times, blurst times. Imagine exposing covid lot young people tell families person responsible got 500 pound fine.

Wait, situation legal adults, right? legal (young-ish 19 year consenting adult) walks party 50 people, turn around walk away see size crowd, say “the person responsible” exposure person hosted party? zero personal accountability world? wouldn’t family man attended party 3 hours, met future wife there, made woman eventually marry - wouldn’t family blame making decision look wife thus put family risk?

You act host secretly dosed keg Covid-19. Covid-19 probably party all, nobody reporting sick (yet). I’m going assume host spent time money throw fun party, motivation fun, meet people, know, thing 7 months ago nobody called host criminal? social circles, leave party guests would THANK host putting effort throwing nice party.  Oh he's handled terribly. people naive think playing initially kind aberration pandemic planning. Public health experts fingers many pies think panic virus would disturb all. People *need* accept anything unless want to, regardless consequences. Governments care money, accepting risking everyone's lives problem them. would be, different types special ed Correct. living people spread prolifically dead people can. clicks. surprised this? New York delayed indoor dining months much spread amplified people gathering indoors without masks on. ones UK dramatically better that. Almost sounds like Toxoplasma gondii :P really need CDC study point out? longer accept isn’t viable option, longer deal u til reaches point everything shut anyway much longer I'd expect reasonably bright six year old better this. honestly say would capacity follow COVID-19 orders 18 years age?

Yes. given well hundred literal children I've supporting one way another doing, dare say people would. joke sour? mean stubborn? mean like told do?   I’m guessing you’re Florida? Fake til make would purpose be? brother-in-law experience you. resisted suggestions see Chiropractor years, severe back pain. 

Finally gave try, last resort, since practically bed-ridden worked amazingly! like new man. don’t follow. idea experts lying, time many people distrustful experts, seems like problem.

Supply chains recovered. credibility hasn’t.

I’m sure anyone’s concept fairness enters picture. Tbh poor quality education many US places fully understand homeschooling. people may religious nuttery/being overprotective, many want good education kids crazy otherwise.

Yes, antivaxxers crazy people. Bite me. known yet whether benefit comes wearing mask protection versus wearing one protect others. thought evidence favour protecting others?

“Mask” doesn’t mean one thing. wish report would stop suggesting they’re same. Well sure, distancing better, can't always distance, that's masks for. unfortunate public position voice power say things harmful others like that.  Jeez. old you? Like 8? someone reads headline post facebook believes it? 
The increase employment due couple things.
First drop temporary layoffs, increase long-term unemployments. 
Let's talk numbers since like it. Stats U.S. Bureau Labor Statistics show number people long-term unemployment highest six years 08/2020 even overall number without job fell 04/2020. 
Another stats support issue short-term unemployment declined long-term unemployment increased. Number people work 15 weeks rose 1.8 mil 8.1 four months. yes, may drop overall unemployment, really? theory. hypothesis

A theory well proven multiple round's lab testing positive evidence. strongest form scientific knowledge.

A hypothesis basis begin testing on, AKA: educated guess

Edit: doctor know understand difference others Lol... where? try telling brother stop faking it? No! would rude lead nothing good. It’s easy fall logical trap. Feeling personally safe taking seriously enough. 

And might mean people letting guards virus roams freely it. 

“It’s continent, it’s China. “
“It’s country, it’s Italy. “
“It’s underlying health issues, me”
“It’s hitting 60 yo”  hope conspiracy theorists right virus fake disappear one day. I’m this. Climate strikers achieving goals killing old white man ;) /s true - calculate ""safe"" dose virus given body-type start offering injections virus. don’t know, right comment utter nonsense proving point. finish whiskey beer Uh call osha something? even proposing theory. hypothesis moment. short means, researchers, albeit highly regarded ones, assumption based evaluation anecdotal evidence might possibility Hoooly shit, dude.

Im sorry happened you. dangerous mental state didnt ""break professionalism.""

A therapist, confided deepest insecurities to, used push agenda. wait, there's more! KNEW GUILT ISSUES. USED YOU.

So abuse power dynamic, manipulation, probably way problematic shit.

Thats monstrous. absolutely, unquestioningly report state licensing board. decide go route, please feel like taking action one person. actually advocating patients, may never therapist turn abuse them. said absurd. gone work almost every day since COVID came US. wear mask go wash hand frequently. son works hospital. life somehow less important someone else’s? don’t think so. black life certainly matters me. lost several hospital staff members (elderly, larger diabetic) staff kept going work. press selective hype. report stories deaths employee groups go work know farm workers meat packing plant staff refuse work fun really start.

Your people using phrase next year. never successful coronavirus vaccine history mankind. I’m skeptical anything claim provide couple months protection. majority us could live avoid virus right protective equipment today. Surgical masks don’t provide level protection work closely people avoid virus. use fly aircraft. tried fly certain altitude without mask supplied oxygen, would died. 

Think critically politically. confusing messages though. Don’t wear mask, masks don’t help, masks help, face covering good, there’s societal cultural problem.

The leaders nations absolutely effect populace. Trump would treated serious day 1 told Bob Woodward was, America would FAR better shape right now.

When 40% country believes flu, hoax, going clear week, lies Trump knowingly fed them...this virus never getting contained. Ever.

Meantime places like Ontario conservative leadership, messaging clear measured day 1. Infection rates extremely low, numbers came unfortunate spreads retirement homes.

I met spoken single person thinks Coronavirus serious, thinks flu, thinks masks necessary, etc. people hard time handling idea life fair? love say everybody else. supply chains recovered, credibility still hasn’t. That’s cost lives. [It affect Fast &amp; Furious: America Drift saying wore mask even covid outbreak? 

If not, fall block morons hope lovely wedding day!! maybe huge 5 year anniversary party make-up reception? Sending lots love! Evolutionary wise makes sense, virus makes someone sick laying bed don’t spread much someone running around symptomatic flu flu vaccine helped like took economic hit like countries afflicted virus.

Sure, intense sustained country, point it? CCP managed excellent job controlling outbreak well save economy, placing well people can't believe think China country attack disinformation. know? member disinformation campaign. 

I could say you, would ever convince other? least know won’t lie :) say that? Read article. Whatever's going Sweden, would surprised idiots attacking ambulance workers UK a) drunk, b) plenty ancestors Britain long time. it? checked non american news outlets? 'news outlets' watch america actually talkshows

I'm europe  still get people get hung early advice months months.
I thought intelligent species able improve knowledge topic adapt accordingly. Telescoping process takes FIVE YEARS (if it’s fast) ultimately produce useless dangerous vaccine They're saying opposite. Measles vaccine prevents developing measles. There's reason politicians want make hard vote possible. Yes, issue. However, excuse seizing masks purchased states order resell back states higher price. retarded ass wrinkly boomer swinging 70s mean people still sex. they're using condoms (particularly straight people), mostly AIDS. oh ok  husband help you? from?  half say absolute bull shit. would less damaging experts’ credibility. value. People don’t want feel like they’re lied to.

Now Facebook feed full people pointing we’re months advertised 2-3 week lockdown. ""The real vaccine masks wore along way"" remember people screaming Disney wasn’t providing information sick workers. agree great, thing tried point seemed standard businesses. said, I’m glad moving towards transparent system. Employees customers able know many people linked business recently infected. course names identifying information need shared, notices put help protect everyone. saying ignorant. 
Kudos goals working for? well least get anyone shot. Well I'm glad thisguy isnt part problem one man wearing mask job rather not. No, attenuated vaccine generally refers vaccine that's genetically modified version actual virus, created reducing virus's virulence. one currently attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, although apparently India working it.

Recombinant means take genetic material pathogen (in case, part RNA responsible SARS-CoV-2's spike protein) fuse RNA vector virus (in case adenovirus various strains), thus ""re-combining"" them. result adenovirus grows SARS-CoV-2 spike protein instead spike protein, thus outwardly looks kind like SARS-CoV-2. creating recombinant virus vector vaccine also deliberately damage replication function vector cause full blown infection start spreading own, hence also hear ""replication deficient"" mentioned talking class vaccine.

Adenovirus vector it' used many disease, carrier section RNA targetting. adenovirus also vectors influenza virus. China week started phase 1/2 trial recombinant influenza virus vector vaccine administered intranasally (ie breath in).

But hey, take word it, check WHO's agree! Sunglasses mask I’ve barely worn makeup months! Every time put one on, feel autism starting, tracks similar thing happened recently dentist. abort mid-cleaning hygienist telling COVID really contagious since 6000 people actually died it. Sad times. welcome news, remember [even asymptomatic illness may lasting effects health, including lung damage increased risk catch it, less likely hospitalised. mean absolutely fine, course, able spread others infected. far better infected vaccine. Dude 4 times larger per capita, cases per million. US 4 times number cases(not deaths, cases) compared italy, per million

Let explain simpler terms. government can/should control overall spread cases. death rates influenced hospitals, doctors availability equipment. Italy 1/4 per captia cases America similar death rates ICU equipment death rate per 100 high 14%. Meanwhile American hospitals equipment able bring death rate 5% lower 

To summarize - American government failed contain disease therefore america 4 times many cases italy per capita 

Meanwhile anerican doctors hospitals controlled death rate similar Italy absolute numbers 1/3rd terms deaths per 100 compared italy

But overall point still stands. America 4 times cases per capita Italy. % per capita italy, number deaths would 45k instead 195k

As post, usually benefit anyone reading someone cannot understand facts government controls vs hospitals wearing neck gaiters bandanas actually increase chances others around getting covid compared wearing covering all. know avoid people knows homemade masks loose made material. Masks giving people immunity? That's masks work. effective blocking virus not? im building immunity wearing mask means job.  science behind reddit spread non-sense again? made mistake early saying masks necessary. Oh god, WebMD status? Excuse me, believe post belongs r/lifeprotips reopening schools strongly encourages behavior. also encourages people move across country case winter semester happens.

i'm going repeatedly offer recovering alcoholic beer, that's dick move. Please, report (anonymously) relevant authorities area. straight manslaughter negligence. Thanks shortened article remember reading article effect early pandemic. I've heard explained scientists time time. 

I'm sure billed theory. always known? viruses work? get single virus, body plenty time develop immune response multiplied enough make really ill. get massive dose, so. 

(Presumably, applies viruses colds flu. think it, care. least, West.) 

As might read responses, mask wearing measures universal places like Taiwan Japan explain disease virtually wiped countries. yes, make sense. Surgeon General puppet Executive Branch.

The CDC much common reply “yeah, know bunch people sick November I’m pretty sure it, actual number people hade already definitely like 20%”. know mean. live major city people wear masks even outside (a surprising amount people still wearing noses though). major pharmacy chain store day waiting flu shot staff masked behind plexiglass. 

Then maskless woman walked (probably early 30s) stalking aisles people avoided her. signs everywhere telling people masks required, citywide mandate served without one. entrance store display set selling masks too, there’s way woman accidentally forgotten. demeanor could absolutely tell angry ready take anyone commented. pick script rudely spoke pharmacist multiple times wasn’t ready yet. Instead waiting outside, continued stride around store basically daring anyone make eye contact. 

After left heard staff asking manager deal customers refuse wear mask.

So far haven’t seen single person complying mask mandate store store since implemented back around April, week saw two people refusing wear masks (including lady). Staff scared say anything people bored getting bolder anti mask videos misinformation available. asked first woman saw going put mask could come store well told “not worry it” immediately became rude aggressive. really got back couldn’t help getting sucked started making fun accent. you’re right, people regard others around there’s telling resort angry standoff defend freedom give shit others. know right. CCP willing sacrifice economy save people, end saving both.

Lmao kid, Chinese economy always destined come net positive China strategic stronghold medical device PPE tried sacrificing people save economy, saved neither.

More like took economic hit like countries afflicted like one went competent strategy one say?

Looks like one time posture pandemic implement draconian lockdown measures telling rest world sit Chinese sympathizer right things (minus initial cover Wuhan/Hebei government) disinformation attack certain countries trying shift blame due dismal performance pandemic?

I can't believe think China country attack disinformation. know? member disinformation campaign. better let hands rest typing, hear Xi likes firm grip morning. N95 3-ply surgical masks? Eye protection too? Wait.... maybe anti-maskers knew along? started wearing mask, last 9month haven’t allergy issue, cold/flu, sinus issues, morning cold air cough gone, haven’t felt healthy while... mean honestly part everyone told wear masks early on. awful building trust public health officials. Well society supports hedge fund managers teachers . mean look benefits hedge fund managers bring society /s agree People also getting older year Canada also decided keep water wet. Canada,they think leaders lock eliminate election process.  Control masses. end? idea. I've asked people never get reply.  Freedom coronavirus? can't find comparable stats age range, 18-49 year olds whole approximately 3,000 deaths per year. difficult valid comparison moment based US figures; comparisons found trust data place mortality rates 30-34 age group 10 times influenza. headline sounds like think it’s bad thing. US phase three trials rolling people risk volunteer, too. coworker diabetic, doctor recommend opt in, he’s already taken it. Lol resident Dakotas definitely lot college kids think they're good red necks think masks terrible. good part community still supposed to. know sane normal people. many tell winter people shirts - 30 included wind chill economy heavily relies tourism. neighbor like this.  Luckily, nonsense thinking also sees wanting daughter subjected it, masks closed, keeping virtual learning year. need get details, results speak themselves. Even inflate China’s death rate 40 times it’s still lower US. account per capita death rates, China 160 times better. Let’s say China fudged numbers lied factor 100 (which would highly improbable given large scale death rate would many tell tale signs), it’s still better US per capita basis. 

So, results speak themselves. Chinese response least effective wealthy powerful nation world. think he's trying kill 'deplorables' white folk 'caught crossfire' considered 'acceptable collateral damage'.  


Or, least, that's seems me. also seems pretty, awfully, horribly obvious. :( ""Based analysis, striking age 25 significantly lower risk death COVID-19 flu.""

Don't shoot messenger. case, IFR come and, UK, example flu deaths covid deaths recorded way. diseases rarely fatal young people.

Vaccines provoke immune response. way vaccines work otherwise vaccines.  year? **T**he problem might travel outside states. choose willfully ignorant issue.

 national mandates, state laws *united* common sense propriety. box way out? Numbers continue coming nicely, deaths converging near zero. better response ask for?  FTA 48 yo woman sick since March. jumping conclusions based evidence, issuing warning based personal experience. no, ""the exact thing here"". two completely different things. Well hope works. Monday night covid party!! Oh see. That’s makes sense already vaccinated changed stances. I’m glad wasn’t got yours!
Thank . Parenting hard. Like vaccine? now, explosions killed multiple times people Beirut pandemic entire Lebanon. one talking ‘indefinitely”.

All gatherings avoided. them. Wow...the denial reality strong one.

I live state. watched hospitals filled doctors pleaded ppl stay home /wear mask etc. Bc wouldn’t able save life came hospitals. Ambulances sat bays waiting 8-12 hrs. real. Bc put hands ears chanting “it’s real it’s real” doesn’t make less Stay safe. hear you. One guy told work recently, ""it's around months, know everyone it"".  time, one hospital area 85 covid tests one shift. We're it. true. Gosh fb much cooler open public. hard tell seriously responsible strong political dived cause FB obama came around time(I feel like Obama republicans really tapped everything-democrats-does-is-bad genes). letting annoying chainmail people twisting news feed used sorted recent show us keeps us fb worst. fb really wanted help stop misinformation they'd make new feed show recent again. Keywords general sense meta tag sense. Searching ""masks make people complacent study"" similar bringing anything relevant me. asking phrases/words would likely get I'm looking for. Yes, deaths cases trending downward according worldometer. One easiest ways poke holes conspiracies number accomplices. number people even organizations involved exponentially raise chance conspiracy exposed thus make less credible.

For example let's use 9/11:

A conspiracy elements government let 9/11 happen. chains would broken gates left open allowed. people would involved, good old fashioned incompetence could help too.  conspiracy somewhat plausible

Now let's say planned orchestrated US government. Many individuals different organizations would work concert still organizations look clandestine activities. would need influence essentially hire terrorists foreign nation, disguising are, evading detection intelligence agencies, also foreign ones, hostile friendly.  conspiracy extremely dubious,

That planes crashed twin towers, buildings rigged collapse. would need either everything previous conspiracy, much information planned attack someone else certainly would noticed sent red flags stopping attack. would gone two crowded buildings America set explosives/thermiite/comprimised structure absolutely massive, busy building, without anyone either noticing, able wave away credentials, phoning different agencies see up.  conspiracy drunk need go home.

Now COVID much much worse that. would need virtually every government agency, health organization, hospital concert fake pandemic. would need police EMT well, addressing fake calls, fake bodies, treating people fake diseases. would insurmountable undertaking anyone actually capable of, would basically need god-like levels persuasion, clairvoyance presence, thing would certainly boring them, could probably get us much worse entertaining things. conspiracy theory far another universe. absurd unwarranted optimism. know Platt. Since nobody knows, caution warranted. Fueling it, idiocy America, Americans, unbelievable. Like, want things get better ? kid isn’t even talking because, mask denying ass, said it’s ‘ people like ‘. Thought raised better... Ooooh, winning idea: waste time effort resources chasing impossible dream ""going back normal"" instead pushing alternatives better nightmarishly terrible.   Need take several large grains salt data self-reported study way demonstrate cause effect. That's fundamentally mask is

It filters particles air.

Like want mean question like 'how umbrella help raining'

It's fundamental purpose thing even magically stop exposure. odd person adverse reaction like virus! shut whole country down, next generations?! Flu dart? *sigh* Start I’m sorry happened. Heartbreaking. causes kinds issues. I'm afraid stop sanitizing groceries mail. say safe to, also said masks didnt help prevent virus said everyone needs wear mask. trust them? think politicians without serious preconditions this. theory/hypothesis

Holy 5th grade. That’s right. I’m doctor researcher. I’m learning go like people here. Quebec independent nation, would rank toward top among nations world's highest COVID-19 fatality rates per population. seeing BBC report plans greatly expand healthcare capacity, plans multiple field hospitals. They're planning large spike cases death. ambitious ""moonshot"" testing program. guess not. doctor tell sticks Time tell honestly virus push people get really good shape overweight obese breathing problems top covid. take Solid care body get Vitamins get virus fine better see driving smoking ever well fine. even bother going I'm doctor epidemiologist. content assertion China undue influence WHO, nothing evidence-free dera⁣nged talking point straight ora⁣nge man's public relation's team ears.

This st⁣upid pointless conversation. pull head a⁣s⁣s take responsibility yourself, shameless gh⁣oul. one else kind bumbling incompetent downright malicious non-response response like anti-science joke government. Personally, think awesome resorting baseless blaming others rather actually learning mistakes. I'll ready popcorn point laugh next time happens again. Hopefully even worse results. entire world knows systemic incompetence apathy massive vulnerability, massive disaster waiting. matter when. Another pandemic happen. Next time might benign. Oof, day day must rough. Look, three jobs, one going several businesses network people. One ten people wearing mask walk office, put see me. thing restaurants— cooks nose mask they’re cooking.

HR won’t anything— they’re probably even wearing mask office. would work home independently contact others ever. wants information masks accurate. He’s worried since media (and researchers) don’t specify type ( n95 vs cloth vs other) characteristics, style wearing(over mouth nose vs mouth), people rely masks place good ventilation social distancing. Bc chose lie country COVID-19 early keep lie going. would happen suddenly told people need wear mask protect deadly virus liberal hoax(his claim mine)? said schools aren’t safe children Bc virus (that claimed wasn’t real)was still control? instead threatened withhold funds children govs didn’t force COVID filled classrooms. threatened withhold PPE certain states. Think evil past months...knowing whole time bad virus really was. keep lie protected. Kind politicized comment think? hypothesis mentions human studies worth noting. two folks responsible reporting hospital absolutely work weekends report.  understanding don't, jeopardize federal funding. It’s unproven theory. put mass print?

“Still, Dr Monica Gandhi, infectious disease physician University California, San Francisco, one paper’s authors, stressed commentary limitations construed anything theory.” College kids getting $500 fines. that’s they’re Covid positive supposed quarantining hosting big parties instead. Especially something straightforward ""We need get shitton X B, cost real concern"". Dont blame individual action worthless president. woman blamed. want work, adequate protection. can’t provided, option remotely. Exactly. Except they’re still learning degree asymptomatic people shed/spread virus. CDC said weren’t contagious redacted statement day later. Ahhh pretty sure borders closed tourists. South Korea? That's standard bearer pandemic control among non-island getting second wave back control. Obviously magnitude different, reality same

No, reality same. mention ""maginitude different"" go argument totally invalidate argument. 

hundreds cases deaths anywhere near what's happening US. Yes, vaccination technically correct term inoculation cowpox, devied Latin *vaccinus* meaning cow-based. Oh man... irony comment strong. Thanks laugh, even though know didn’t intend comment hilarious. 

Here’s Life pro tip though, take working vaccine it’s available, regardless invents it. may save life, life someone know. They’ll never believe it! Hmmmmmm replying :)

I support vaccines know scientific advancement helped lot people survive worst diseases. Polio, chickenpox, soon, coronavirus. know don’t take vaccine, run risk catching disease, spreading people, perhaps killing them. don’t know you, don’t want run risk leaving trail death behind every time go out. Humans animals too, want protect them, that’s quarantined since March. It’s either vaccines go back middle ages die age 30 lol

Let’s go!  24 week preemie March. ever leave house doctor appointment bet we’ll using masks even we’ve properly vaccinated. Like would ever go airplane without one? Oh god, don’t say it. Oh god. 2020 still over. restaurant work open takeout since May, inside dining second available. 

I feel extremely lucky point, single person know tested positive. gotten really sick.

The thing makes feel slightly ok
Is ton sickness Feb/early March maybe early COVID. 

Also, are, far, busiest ever restaurant. 3 dining rooms basically inside, outside, parking lot turned outside dining. 

I still get scared. takes one person coming in. bf dishwasher. live together also upstairs job. one person comes dines restaurant, extremely likely get it.

I wish we’d go back RED let taxes I’ve paid 18 years take care 🙄 vet even let us lobby   Lol silly title bullshit article. Get proof. Get data. Get rest scientific community around.  done whole lot better AZ, around 7.3 million people compared population 10.5 million. We've 5300 deaths today, last looked total excess deaths around 7200. good luck happening matter put office.

half voters wont listen half regardless whether advice sound.

Americans ingrained issue authority whole year hasnt made incredibly clear. trump snowflakes fucking stupid. Seriously. No.

There plenty data saying came nature.

Stop bullshit conspiracy campaign. Oh man. understand that. started working place loved, people loved (had issue managers, that's par course) got ""furloughed""... two days ago got laid off, coworkers (but official two months) found reopening next week, received communication boss. we're really confused right now.

I know feel, though. always worry say ""when happens next year, I'll this"", time comes next year, WANT that. Like experience taught us anything, lot happen (so far half!) year. often changed mind things... would end existential crisis realize best interest keep going started from. I'm going back college soon take last class finally realized wanted originally did. makes feel good. People gonna stay home uncertain amount time, time realize great question. Answer know. 
 
Areas distinct seasons peaks cold (or sometimes rainy) seasons. Countries without distinct seasons tend continuous level without clear peaks.   didn’t start wearing middle June believe people wearing them. Lol, title suggestively ominous. know actual death rate now? saw Dr John Campbell said it’s .3 .6% seems pretty low... Nah, I'd argue back - look skyrocketing deaths NYC surrounding states. seen anything close since. Sure better treatments, masks leading lower viral doses probably keeping deaths lower vs back then, still think cases would super high get many deaths. like city noticing couple homeless people putting bunch concrete spikes like camp? It’s novel virus.

Not really, minor mutation SARS strain went around almost 20 years ago. fucked let one get control. Sitting opposite people talking loudly spread. Sitting rows quiet much safer. I'm sure psychics give good life advice well. make fake profession much less unethical sham even 5 percent offer real services business plan based tricking people. know severity exposure linked severity symptoms, meaning even improperly-worn PPE (I think customers store ill-fitting masks, especially elderly) reduce ""bad"" case one gets.


This good news wearer, adequate appropriate protection, agree. short scarce supplies, frightening thought. goes show overwhelming system looks like. done. fact attenuated virus vaccine, likely route successful vaccine using tried-and-true techniques, great news. Getting large sample size proves successful limited side effects give China exactly want -- viewed source solution, problem.

I wish best. least they're trying, unlike Fuhrer. mask up, open everything way, microdose covid!! True not, comments like make people want give wear masks now. Everyone killed Covid lives affected major ways. losing quality time friends family members, losing healthy years. Grandparents missing spending time new grandbabies. Patients terminal diseases missing final opportunities go things love. friend died cancer week ago. knew start year much time left planned spend year things enjoyed. lost that. People going willingly give next year+ lives reality one knows much time left. Heh. know Reddit pretty much standard, yeah foolishly hoping something little meaningful.  Yes. 

We are. 

Herd immunity end result vaccines.  Whoa know cruises go thought science research centers 90's kids remember... Trump absolute moron, fair guys also told us wear masks beginning this. know, law sell bigger packages retail stores. It’s called variolation They're definitely going triggered aftershock. saying masks cause autism! /s Look wear mask everywhere go. know help. also see tons people wearing incorrectly, way may actually harm good.

They walk counter order food pull mask hand start talking. cover mouth nose, think mask makes okay lean extra close talk people. I've actually seen somebody wearing mask covers nose mouth. Haha never thought way. God damn it. “general public” part hit hard... want taste try browsing around deep web. Obviously take safety precautions. general public vicious, viciously dumb viciously vicious wow, teachers went house?
Was son immun-compromised similar? Wonder bigot trump fan boys/gals taking this. Wow, sounds terrifying idea effect. can't even imagine stay remember actually breathe know seems pretty easy comprehend me. Plenty stupid people, horrible leadership, cult personality politics set mask wearing identity label. expect? corrupt core US government honest population rather trying manipulate herd like sheep? easy opt latter. Levas com um bacalhau salgado nas trombas que te fudo! excuse me, breastfeeding considered part odd stereotype around area planet?

I'm 30 that. many precautions taking advocating currently recommended public health authority. Sad. many areas 911 ops placed law enforcement.

Keep doing! entirely true, many chiropractors primarily physical therapy, depends at. Go poor blue collar town 95% business unpinching nerves giving physical therapy exercises, lot good there. Go chiropractor collar prosperous town urban center however, 95% bullshit white collar workers completely fuck joints body regular money waste bullshit. Unless find doctor 70 years old unlikely stick knee back wrench body release nerve, give painkillers, really help blue collar worker use painkillers work pain aggravate problem. real vaccine masks wore along way hear say he's masks? heard say strongly believes everyone wearing masks pandemic. comment makes sense. saying masks social distancing make COVID-19 contagious? help Healthcare workers, essential workers first responders need most. 

Implying anyone America cares someone else needs hey hey hey, didnt say actually going eat afterwards 😂 Omg lol  Lets honest though, vet offices happy excuse interact us interact dogs cats. Actually beginning saying pointless quickly changed beneficial. I’m glad wore one either way pros drinking Kool-aid: could lifesaving millions

cons drinking Kool-aid: kinda uncomfy

*takes long sip* actually read paper

I did. 63 pages it. Heres link: 

http://ftp.iza.org/dp13670.pdf

The issue paper says, purpose saying misrepresented incite fear anger one side, foster doubt science other. 

This paper single experiment massive, collaborative project figure complex problem determining economic impact pandemic. intended audience educated economists used foster discussion things like development refinement economic models calculating predicting economic toll super spreader event identifying data defeciencies lead poor results.

It **is not** meant say ""If went Sturgis bad person responsible 260k infections $12B hit US economy public vilify forever."" meant say ""We're ignoring objectivity, twisting reality making things numbers look bad possible fit desired political narrative, scientists really do"". 

All saying data used, modeled done it, comes figures. Ideally, economists build upon methods develop better models better data, others build those, forth they've got way make accurate predictions future. Nah karma oblivion daily reminder you’re idiot 😊 feel like might get deadlier months. People taking seriously. thanks job. guys get bad confusing N95 surgical masks homemade face coverings.

We never were, still not, supposed wear medical grade masks like among general public. provide level protection general public need, health care workers absolutely need.

The change whether public wear types face coverings. initial thinking offer enough protection might actually make spread worse induce people fidget touch face lot. Later decided offer enough protection outweigh risk improper mask usage face touching. Agent Smith says Morpheus start interrogating first movie. say 1999 earlier movie said Matrix takes place end 20th century, presumed present day (1999). said start smaller viral load less likely cause symptoms/issues first place! Nurses docs ER settings even proper PPE exposed much virus dying it. makes much sense. fuck Conservatives obsession shit people affect them? dropping acid wearing fucking mask, backward fucks can't get nose lives.

And gall claim want ""individual liberty"". mean ""no aren't"" enough totally refute? didn’t want us panic! /s  Bars parties aren’t end all. I’m shocked many people prioritize that. date, fun friends, good time drink without going places. It’s also cheaper get one one time people hanging someone’s house small group anyway.  Look around you. Americans act. Hey whatever works you. long part. 👍  Definitely. Put posters like ""al Qaeda ISIS want Americans die. Uncle Sam wants wear mask."" reminds many people insisted covid regular cold, can't help think they're total idiots. Amen, I'm even big history buff presented well I'd watch regardless. definitely don’t want give clients. like think best clients world. it’s painful imagine starting another shop, people. finally landed felt like belonged - truly belonged. endured lot get there. took chance swung level took in. learned much, grew. felt supported respected heard pretty much first time career.

Shifting goalposts eh? Even general idea herd immunity requires vaccine. regular definition citing “unproven theory” . sub full propaganda. important jump gun something anti-vaccine people would Covid parties would micro-dose children there's study loosely implies something. Thanks saving trouble. hoping /u/Jmeister93 would realize Sweden's deaths awful, too.

Extend Sweden's deaths country size USA get 200,000 dead far, obviously really bad. fact health care system able handle numbers actually impressive, though. Cool guys look explosions. agree that’s should’ve done. 

Unfortunately, many places couldn’t bothered take care citizens month two. Yeah, baffles TF people still go see chiropractors though real harmless. 6 months covid patients may positive side Seeing there’s good research (at least last time hacked) showing chiropracty net positive effects, feel definition chiropractors anti-science [me People remotely aware many people need get infected order get herd immunity. Iirc, 70%. So, 70% US population 229 million. fatality rate alone 1%, that's 2.2 million dead Americans. know trump asked people care maks cukt would follow tht would make big difference 

There huge difference China style western countries did. good leader right messaging would still made huge difference provide specific examples? hell China comment? shitty propoganda mean conclusion PPE reducing severity true. It’s opinion there’s studies back it. protect others getting wearing PPE, almost certainly. precisely: couple educated friends repeated CDC advice wear masks, early on. wear masks. seems entirely plausible.  president. Covid often causes cardiac issues due clotting. Bad economic outcomes also CAUSE bad public health outcomes. Jesus, encouraging, really needing good fucking news! mom homeschooled me, antivax. voiced regrets vaccinating several occasions.

Luckily restrict internet usage learned think via youtube occasional Roblox forum thread. Americans acted like Spanish flu, no. numbers correct, encouraging news. track finally become airline pilot summer probably happen years. would fantastic air travel could recover quickly everywhere. makes sense would imagine exposed virus regular basis work like that. Good news medical field least. Facebook completely insane rate things going, 100 years descendants speaking Mandarin 100% wear mask Chairman tells to! say countries cases deaths per capita? give up. strongly suspect explosion people want ink feel safe get it. might something else while, give up.

(Or could hardcore projecting since massive unfinished piece much pasty white skin.) Winter coming. made wrapped something nose mouth. It’s rocket science seven months recovering people already claiming permanent damage. Wow. vet won’t allow pet owners building all. drop dog door outside mask, appointment call go details payment bring dog back out. recent development though.

Public health officials cant lie entire country expect people doubt following that. truly fascinating fuck. don’t even try fact check sources unreliable cabal control media find lots people understand asymptomatic carrier.. people simply -don't care- .. Young, healthy.. ""If meant die, I'll die"".. ""Few people die, cares?""  


What understand long-term effect getting it. think 2 week flu everything back normal them.  


 
For parties - get many people want still live, may harmed COVID.. going feel like shit someone know get hurt actions. see sailor moon mask, please PM me. Thx. Someone know works rehab floor hospital, tell they’ve never seen many stroke patients before. really can’t tell trolling attempt. Fuck miss pre-2016 America. mean... fauci said would end 2021 things back normal.. took heavy sleeping pills along Covid, compromised oxygen levels. Ugh. damn chiropractors. grandmother goes one tried convince stop getting flu vaccines. woman 80s, exact person needs vaccinated flu. (I mean do, demographic especially). took forever change mind visit I’m vet school former RN. Stay lane chiropractor quit filling Nana’s head psychobabble bullshit. Conservatives inherently authoritarian. echo message comes higher authority. That's destructive national response virus Trump started mocking denigrating mask use. Yup, really are. vaccine comes out, unlikely 100% effective. target effectiveness around 70% 80%, would enough essentially eradicate virus reducing transmission R0 value 1.

Guess though... masks already fall effectiveness category. widely available throughout world right now. side effects. 

So yes, essentially already vaccine, yet also already 'anti-maskers' well, reduces population-wide effectiveness keeps virus spreading. weaker chicken pox/cow pox virus. noticed people got cow/chicken pox get small pox. concept vaccination originated  quarantine healthy? Source please. point. We’ve vaccinated twice. says share find out. confirm. masks first needed worn, reusing masks multiple times ER. quickly set 4 disposable surgical masks rotated day day others sat dash ""disinfect"" sunlight could get couple cloth masks.

Edit: Still, blame hoarders, blame fucking federal government stealing masks purchased meant particular state resell back states. Makes sense, would explain haven’t gotten sick yet. work medical field mask every day close quite COVID patients. Real question- harder talk mask on? Like caller hear properly? imagine yes wanted ask.  apply contacted? applied time ago (a month two) heard anything yet. give lot medical info, wonder demographic enough volunteers. Yes. Simpsons. Yet real estate area hottest 15 years. insane. Exactly. used survival fittest. survival intelligent. Antivaxxers antimaskers die covid leaving us society fix proud of. recall, earliest days, downplayed effectiveness/necessity masks panic buying would interfere medical supply chains. 

I mean, get reasoning definitely get front right away. same. get educated person could believe masks work. thinking logically virus spreads (we knew back spread droplets air), make everyone conclude masks likely help. idea masks worse mask purely stupid Also sorry don’t spend day Reddit commenting subs. don’t spend much time app besides reading updates virus. guess spend time commenting everything see less time interacting others reality. ya know there’s something wrong probably won’t end it. V shaped?

More like K shaped... I'm type one diabetic health issues. wear mask, barely go outside, always use hand sanitizer. tested last week turns antibodies! fully believe got minor case exposed small amount virus due mask precautions. Stay safe there! honestly think antimaskers grasp concept they’re still choosing wear masks? article absolute shit.

Edit: check profile Wow predictable thing 2020 far: reasons **wear frickin mask.** run head realized absolutely kooky anti maskers look, given post kinda shown masks great idea.... they're actually far great idea.

Their logic reminds given enough comple morons, imagine standing flat earth, could possibly infected enigmatic virus.... drink much Anaconda Malt Liquor.

🤯 Mind... Blown... Aha. super genius businessman. monster. still people blindly repeating masks dont protect wearer saying this? 

Yes, one form lung damage lasts long time seems fade eventually. Note article say ever goes away completely. possibly know yet?

Similarly, there's also fifteen twenty long-term effects body (and brain), know fade, idea many years.  China's central govt knows hide epidemic risk overthrown real way, least Maxxine!  partisan idiot feel need call someone idiot saying Trump smart. Remember beginning authorities, Surgeon General, literally told public masks ineffective virus? Fucking crazy. oldest six kids remember helping mom cloth diapers big safety pins. Seemed like big deal. 

Now find depressing millions people use disposable diapers tossed trash one use. Yeah, let us forget TP situation early on. would masks sure. said, would short term problem Trump administration could used emergency powers compelled businesses make masks. Correct, I'm responding poster said states ""fully open"" already peaked crazy high numbers. saying business open mean compare consumer behavior flu season. think said masks depressing wearing mask new normal I'd lying said think looking Hello Kitty mask. hotels runs $120 night, definitely 5 stars definitely cheap (the budget hotels area run $75-$95 night. agree, stick higher brands much much much cleaner. along vaccine masks wore along way* Maybe get much bad doom worse news actually something positive report. obgyn doctor initial part visit said, sitting 6 feet apart. Feel free take mask off. told her, thanks, kept mask on. Smh  [Persistent Lung Damage Improves Gradually Definitely makes sense. heard doctor explaining theory way see children chickenpox. first kid picks school community relatively mild disease, gives siblings get moderate severe disease viral load much higher. Living infected person creates much opportunity getting slammed vast amount viral particles first kid brief exposure somewhere else comparatively. also vouch experience: second kid nearly hospitalized. Holy shit 

Report guy professional college. 

Side note amazed horrified effective propaganda is.  Good news is, mask shortages anytime soon. you’re actually asking lol. Going back normal without takes *normal* safely, that’s worse lot Florida is.. important time doctors medical staff short supply recycling them. also lockdown could go essentials. Nobody anticipated Trump turning wearing mask political statement, are. that's true Nope 😎 What? Please correct wrong. Ideally numbers. Yeah, know chiropractor who’s 3 different vacations 5 different states since May thinks masks lower kids oxygen levels enough affect brain function.

Chiropractors aren’t scientists doctors. They’re anti-science quacks crack back good, that’s all. 911 radio op


Not surprised one bit mentality. Dude tell it. tend drink Republican Kool Aid claim platform person, essentially worship whoever nominee ignore past misdeeds. lack critical thinking astounding comes politics many adults I've grown around even they're really smart areas. They'll defend Trump past future Republican presidents presidential nominees graves. People look back mask debacle almost verbatim 1918 flu pandemic cycling air past one these, preventing accumulation pathogens air? Australia becoming boring dystopia. mean imagine people still would gotten shot masks. would “I want mask, give I’ll shoot you.” Oh grounds, nazi care surge depression suicides? compassionate! Nah cats get too.  Quit calling Americans stupid know reasons infections. ever thought people might working shopping essentials. Also remember Americans live country 50 states call countries basic governments. Plus 330+ million people. part?  fuck!? 

over mask? 

this inhumane. billionaires incentive drag economy crippling pandemic  mean yes technically right. know possible consequences actions. 

Can't say anything though unless want get accused victim blaming. Bring back Willinium makes sense It’s never going away like H1N1 never gone away. rehabilitate person would do
such thing? Honesty, I’m curious.  it’s coronavirus subreddit lmao don’t like page leave know.  awesome. I'm Moderna study. far face fallen off...lol I'm due shot 2 10 days. study runs 2 years.   Lol good, clarify. b That’s literally nazis Holy shit sub waking up

This insanity. guy wanted back hopes getting sick/dead, instead gets beat half death. strengthens argument  SPANISH FLU THING.

THE SPANISH FLU MORTALITY RATE 5 PERCENT

CORONA MORTALITY RATE ONE PERCENT Yeah yet mean next nothing many mask sometimes means you’re sheep. It’s literally insane. know white guy plaster mugshot article. Ahh hoarders talking about. Horrific like Texas? happened that? country already [national emergency building deserves it.

He beat old man pulp good member society. Based viciousness attack, believe judge made error judgment setting bail. guy means released public. edited harsh comment. Sigh. criticism suggestions would listen learn from. mean Greta Thunberg go back school too? (Though Sweden... I'm jealous.) going events mask better events all? Gotta love living Spain outdoor seating terraces norm 3/4 year Yep.

It really went much better carved day fewer chunks major objectives (""do math"", ""get outside"", ""read""). Working home homeschooling really compatible. 35 % excess deaths high matter race. Give right back, 9/11 deaths, per day...   Lol.


. phrases “dumpster fire” “shit show” used. “I made huge poster outside. cut pictures Oriental Trading catalog glued little clocks. everything timed minute,” one mom wrote early days. “It rained end poster, schedule sanity.” Half family homeless, many privleged people opening mouth wanting go back normal. people literally starving. eradication, happen. survive. Staying closed death sentence country. Natural herd immunity strategy. cases people catch once. I’ll admit sample size small still happens. ""Not going vacation ruined!"" miss smiles much like personal space. alas, need both. Probably six feet would better that's like... impossible. You’re idiot. said wouldn’t trust Trump alone, good reason. major vaccine makers already put statement wont succumb political pressure release sure ready. Going totally honest, people apparently insane, started carry licensed conceal carry weapon.

I fan carrying conceal weapon, apparently prudent ever. would personally never speak directly someone obeying mask rules, would go get manager - especially moment carrying. Yes. Yes is. economy isn’t billionaires Wall Street. People need money pay rent, mortgage feed kids. Without lives get pretty shitty COVID positive not. people affected fucked economy lockdowns worse quality life virus. words reddit pretty low calorie

I'll delighted I'm wrong. $2k Yeah thats said general compared populations. must something cause. words, fauci wants us wearing masks 2022 earliest? That’s chief. Actually afraid Africans ""french africans"". recently arrived ones. French ones quite nice :) Yeah man, can. never know days, better safe sorry especially something public-facing.  Wait,

-*checks notes*-

It’s even late 2020 yet, FUCK don’t companies start buy back programs containers? Also, adult eat restaurants much likely participate additional risky behavior large gatherings, etc. morals, code; bad joke. Dropped first sign trouble. They're good world allows be. see- I'll show you. chips these, uh, civilized people? They'll eat other. See I'm monster, I'm ahead curve.
   

The Joker - Heath Ledger Yes, exactly right. exactly said. wants ""shine powerful light inside body"". UV light harmful humans standing skin protects us it. skin inside lungs, kidneys, liver, brain, etc., light, used *inside* body, would kill us. That's said absofuckinglutely incredibly stupid. brings us next fact. % increase deaths per capita magically almost ratio deaths/case.

US 59 cases per 100k

Canada 25 cases per 100k

59/25 = 236%

6.7/3.0 = 233%


So US 236% deaths per capita compared Canada, Canada 233% deaths per case US.


A reasonable could US Canada similar amount cases, rate death. Canada focusing testing worse symptoms.


If true would decrease deaths:captia increase death:case. what's observed here. Honestly would wear mask everywhere next 3 years means stay 6 feet apart everyone maybe college schools opening.... think shit swine flue, bird flu, Zika first appeared since didn’t data? still support restaurants take out. know it’s tough lot people. money important health? 🌊 Still First Wave Stupids 🌊 care unless sick. That's going unfold. TBF, we're like that. Education certainly something it, (uniquely American) attitude ""I'm asking anything anybody, nobody ask anything me"". We're supposed stand two feet, live alongside, with, other. ask people anything common good, sometimes ain't happening. Scheduled go vaykay heading south Disney World two weeks!  Yeah see kind thing shows like Jeremy Kyle Jerry Springer...full young people expect twice age Best movie years playing evening news. putting risk could get it? conclusion managing this, trying stop it. Avoid prolonged exponential growth, clear every western country resisting lockdowns (rightly IMO).

Problem UK extremely confusing messaging. say sell canada. Nothing good happen either states. astounding misunderstanding mathematics. If, worst case scenario, vaccine 50% effective, claim chance illness would cut half true two situations. first vaccinated individual close proximity sick individual. second situation everybody Earth received vaccine immediately, first days would chances infection halved.

In practical terms, chance infection lowered dramatically even small portion population given vaccine partially effective. Let’s say current rt value 1.3, probably much higher American rt actually is, 1/2 population given vaccine 50% effective. means 25% population immune, much lower likely immunity rate among population early mid 2020. So, even unrealistic conditions manipulated beyond bounds likelihood give claim much chance have, 25% immunity rate brings rt 1.3 0.975. rt 0, numbers keep going down. 

Even small portion population inoculated partially effective vaccine would massive effect ending pandemic.

Another note, concern vaccines partially effective isn’t even Fauci primarily talking about. He’s clearly concerned distribution availability. tested blind people?!?



Kidding.... Sorry 2k virus took time kick in.  point article it’s nec sacrifice economy health save other. save lives jobs. Sweden didn’t save either read that’s take flak. I’m sure don’t understand that. Besides locking down, sweden also didn’t ramp testing, encourage mask use, shut bars etc. really messed results show it. would valid point states fully open months seeing crazy high case numbers, haven’t. states already peaked opened back still fine. Try getting 5 billion people Ahh, see dont kids probably another 5-10 years. always hated them, I’ve convinced ever groceries delivered instead. Visibility. asked, assumed read reason. worked. comment even Americans? Sometimes old young people aren’t well home. Instead waiting worsen die, admit them. Babies won’t eat aren’t putting weight common admissions. whats wrong lemon snowcones? need keep arguing people. “they”? common sense tell mask prevent expelling inhaling small particles people’s airborne secretions? Yeah clear would typical development cycle. figured vaccine ready early 2021 push vaccinations spring summer prepare back school fall. 

I also considering life/death would become debated political issue are. hosted party entirely within guidelines people turned uninvited Thank thank ACTUALLY fallacy. drg payment 39k, last virus dx got. virus get spread u.s. like thought would last president put lock people coming country, held one area. believe one guy died nurse died too. Yes, covid listed hospital bill listed number one dx, listed elsewhere. Source, medical claims adjuster paying medical bills day. Un-fucking-believable obvious bullshit. I'm American, get it. really many racist people positions power they're STILL getting away bullshit? OBVIOUS!

Sweden seem close herd immunity Well, know say assuming 🤷 there's huge swath Americans who're used dining frequently Pandemic. Cooking &amp; eating home chore. Also given many ppl working home &amp; isolated, getting out, meal, becomes excursion, way recapture normalcy couple hours. China need sweeping coronavirus vaccination programme pathogen effectively control country – least now, according China’s disease prevention chief.

Gao Fu, director Chinese Centre Disease Control Prevention (CDC), said Sunday large-scale vaccination Covid-19 would needed major outbreak, like one central Chinese city Wuhan February, China News Service reported.

 “This issue balancing risk return,” Gao quoted saying

He said would waste vaccinate everyone coronavirus largely wiped within China’s borders.  Replace Platt r/coronavirus politician bunch redditors comment stands well.  used care. Hell mother's birthday past 20 years constant reminder.

But like said. 200,000 dead 6 months kinds puts miniscule number shame.

And anyone seen film Charlie Wilson's War, basically see America event coming good while.

But no, let's focus one day. Let's talk amount 9/11 deaths occur week. Let's consider pandemic is, one of, largest, global biological threat planet seen since bubonic plague. want woooosh someone, 4 o's. accurate want twat. Nothing said wrong done nothing refute it. gonna repoen *Easter*? /s Fuck! US told us masks matter first month ended giving us something close ten per person. plenty. Sadly possibility getting 200k+ daily high. matter happen. Probably schools colleges open. suspicious headline since used percentages states small. chart really show 7 day death rate went 1 2? Wow, 100% increase.

Don't get wrong, think take precautions bull headed, hate sensationalism. So...who blaming grandmother getting COVID? think sacrifice enough make safe? 

Are blaming others? blaming enough keep safe? 

Or mature enough understand death natural part life viruses care people's intentions; exist. long wearing mask social distancing, I'd say completely fine. worried this. Honestly, even bother isolating unless think I've exposed. know since around anyone caught COVID know anyone that's caught virus point. horrifying news, I'm sorry live around sociopathic assholes like that. :(

 
Hope keep safe, know easy days. Oh, Im talking near future, understand it’s risky pandemic still raging. Im referencing people legit think virus killed concerts forever. Hopes prayers pls Yeah, restrictions quarantine. admins basically removed mods imposed conditions unpalatable shitpuppets became ghost town. Took like 3 murderers associated t_d posters admins get though, problem. long world billionaires individuals seeking gain much power money possible detriment others .... never well run, equitable beneficial world organizations kind anywhere. 

And call total socialism communism ... freaking balance power allow people make money, cost everyone else benefit few. Crazy Sweden lower excess death rate per capita, countries support also think could done better job pandemic. Doubling stupid. explain earlier statements cloth masks. Here's one.  “If want wear cloth mask, use it. Know don’t believe, none colleagues, going major positive impact.”

His earlier statements quoted extensively anti-maskers. seems he's saying supports use cloth masks, previous remarks mischaracterized, approve anti-maskers using aims, say remarks ""mischaracterized"" false, believe. admit changed mind regrets earlier stance. Thank sharing this, comment expressing frustration current state handling things, intended try imply vaccines don’t work (they will). It’s factors around vaccine combined antivax movement worried. called good points. hate idea continue take strict precautions long protect due lack response combined long take us get back “normal” Americans aren’t willing cooperate. also hate idea accepting risk giving up. shit together unity whole wouldn’t way. Going said, seem think 'economy' existed people did. 

Good know. Also, good know one people consider money important saving lives. Thanks outing world.  Please encourage everyone know vote sloppy, useless pig crime family. One day bleach drinker, Miserable Melania Rotting-Robert Trump distant, ugly memories. fucking shit disease spreading everyone take masks ^ Patient Zero right here. finally found them. best part assumes he’s 20%, lol

got love correlation inability overestimation ability I’m 17, bipolar, extrovert, haven’t seen friends person 6 months now. grandparents handful times, cashiers stores. people go fuck themselves. that, grown ass man put partying hold.

And know first hand harmful is. Don’t think single day goes I’m itching upcoming psychiatrist appointment, wishing coffee friend, wishing distance learning could go away could focus enough pass. I’m hardly alone. lives stake unacceptable failure putting selfish interests human life. Trump administration charge OSHA such. They've risen occasion. Yeah mucus completely clear fever etc comparing wide variety contagiousness. saying HIV contagious Covid-19? Herd immunity important Covid-19 specifically everyone readjust every facet living globally. vaccine too. Science!  university track correctly projected June coronavirus deaths United States would top 200,000 Oct. 1 predicting deaths rise even faster pace double end year. nationwide stood 193,215 Saturday, according Johns Hopkins University tracker. **The University Washington's Institute Health Metrics Evaluation** expects they'll top 212,000 Oct. 1. too. :( Trump administration continuing expedite Fauci says highly effective vaccine ready December earliest. you, I'd isolate since can't remember got close her. However, need make essential trip (like grocery shopping), please extremely careful. Please wear high quality mask especially careful get close anyone, even relatives. sister could've caught COVID Thursday evening, would explain symptoms brew Friday morning. probably overkill, cannot take chances extremely contagious virus. curiousity, point lives supposed expect act like reasoning, sane, caring, adults? done schooling? 5 years that? 10 years? Never? mention air quality bad get torrent ashes opening door, yet they're desperate waited they're chowing beer hot wings whatever. knowingly aided spreading lethal virus present around world point countries state lockdown. 

Whatever ethical argument think making falls deaf ears here. get special consideration ""hormones societal expectations throw party"". I'll say again, kid consider lucky 10k fine.

Again, zero sympathy. knew doing, knew happening world, thought face consequences. Anti-masker anti-vaxxers always county? deputy job must cursed. That's problem, argument perfect yet person posing made look incredulous, people disregard argument. That's simply unproductive. You’re right - worded imprecisely, didn’t express quite meant. 

This article articulates mechanism would occur, way tracks known data operates. 

At point, multiple studies strongly connecting viral load illness severity mortality outcome. know studies (including done prior existence disease) masks reduce distance spread viruses exhalation number viruses spread exhalation. also know studies masks reduce virus numbers taken inhalation, compared unmasked inhalation. 

So, yet study connecting pieces (although expect someone working that), multiple significant verified pieces data point different parts coherent whole. I’m scientist ethicist, I’m sure ethical study could designed - assume done via large group results surveys mask compliance, etc. 

But concrete evidence masks reduce number viruses inhaled, low viral load leads much better health outcomes illness contracted. two pieces evidence put together make pragmatist comfortable, even scientist wants more. disagree. choices life. education, job/career, lifestyle, savings choices. decisions made:

I chose get business school instead fine art even though artistic talents. told mom want starving artist. 

When immigrated US 30 years ago, knew foreign degree would discounted employers. money grad school studied CPA exam 4 months. passed subjects 1st attempt. made foreign degree CPA license serves till date.

Getting high student loan choice. alternative get less-expensive community college later, saving money job, either get advanced degree professional certifications. name college needed.

Once, burned career. decided change career starting small business. earned less minimum wages. several years, got job. need know make change things work out.

When 2008 recession hit, entire industry worked collapsed. found job different state within months. took paycut set new skills different industry that's industry I've working since. count government save me. 

At time, tried save 20%-30% paycheck even pay modest. used savings rainy days, house downpayment, retirement. reward along way long financial goals track. 

Everyone plan ahead curb instant gratification make smart choices along way. Life live choice, destiny. sticky announcement mods facts already know like one people quit reposting news articles claiming things over? That’s sucks bud I'd also like point US government gives $38 billion per year subsidies meat dairy industries. Wonder much went companies? Married millennial, slightly older (younger gen x). get it.

The fact humans good adapting things would great dealing situation anything but... Covid something much about. reason us adapt! 
So frustrating. remember thinking, back April, disappointing government's initial response was, half-assed would obvious serious covid was.

Turns half-assed even menu; got no-assed. saw that! make sense. feel, even mask good, killing wear I'm saving fortune sunscreen. Very, very, people argue virus fiction. argument real response overreaction. Closing schools good example. ""experts""

In case article referring Institute Health seem knack doomsday predictions

We probably keep different circle ""experts"" general scientists, medical professionals, economists hear done pretty good job predictions -- advice stave Armageddon. True, sounds like he/she while, admits know everything. feels like masks work them, hard deny that's possibility.  Good luck trusting people caution. FFS opinion natural consequence conspiracy-style thinking, long stuff allowed propagate wild, become insane, there's simply logic it. Sure, makes sense vaccine ready December earliest.  Actually true lol

C'mon, Balto gets credit, Togo real hero! Good them, still gonna take tho.  Judging crowds Tour appears speak 

Were speaking May? think June misheard message. also one strictest lockdowns. isnt sustainable long term Thank thoughtful discussion recent observational study. Although one many scientists public health incredibly worried Sturgis rally, dismayed read article Dave et al. see much erroneous media coverage come this. yet another example faulty economics work bypassing peer-review process damage public health. reading Twitter thread, allude underlying issue mentioning use individual-level data, didn’t specifically see mention ecological fallacy (apologies missed it, though). epidemiology, ecological fallacy occurs inferences individuals based upon aggregate data. argued endlessly economist colleagues minority acknowledge phenomenon, resistant say things like “but used causal models, therefore showed causality.” reading article, semantics modeling approaches proxy datasets don’t even really matter. Even high quality data, none inferences would amount anything unless data individual-level (as eloquently discuss amongst concerns). 

Similarly, another aspect thread point refer study observational, high-level term drilled even more. Typical observational studies include cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, ecological. particular study example ecological study, course, thereby necessitating cautious set inferences. Essentially, said population-level factor X associated population-level factor Y, controlling population-level Z variables. Unfortunately, article instead uses strong causal language throughout. 

Although believe health economics play crucial role public health, yet another example ecological fallacy permeating field. Look Doleac et al. “work” naloxone moral hazard another damaging example, including outright refusal authors acknowledge limitations work. bottom line vehemently disagree economists, let alone scientist public health social science disciplines, adequate tools make causal claims ecological data. Also concerning pre-release platforms allow faulty work get picked media without scrutiny scientific community late. Now, damage done attention shifted away rigorous, well-designed observational experimental studies providing valid inferences effects mass gathering events. COVID deniers get point infighting amongst scientific community proof somehow conjuring hoax. Infuriating say least.

Perhaps graduate programs need explicitly teach ecological fallacy, figuring best solution whole conversation. meantime, hope provides insight one many problems face epidemiology. in: frightening number Americans amoral, stupid, gullible assholes bordering narcissism.

I mean, yes, fuckton morons anti mask/vax/life people government response lackluster.

You cannot expect people comply lockdown/stop spread measures willing help stay financially afloat.

If want people stay home stop spread make sure they're risk complete financial ruin so. instead making sure Americans could comfortably stay home stop spread government way busy passing tax breaks corporations trying provide financial liability protection companies demanded butts seats workers die result. systematic human rights abuse system favours one group rest, creating 170 million severe poverty. people deprived rights access healthcare education first suffer die. average 80 year old 8 years left...

Every week another country surpasses Sweden higher death toll per capita. Many countries intense lockdowns deaths per 100K. Everyone dumbass we’re going die Yes, outdoor space. booked historic manor house, large property planning use outdoor space rather typical indoor space face fact US poor country. unable provide healthcare people, can't feed people, water contaminated, infrastructure falling apart, cops can't put protests, can't even win war bunch farmers guns. It’s amazing see countries conspiring together. Usually disagreement. many sources show deaths due COVID-19 caused expected death counts exceeded many times over.

that's true significant scale all. would consider everything else pfizer, company riddled soon Yep.

I still like get work prepare - *person* well breakfast coffee - sleep extra half hour without commute. live close office, time saving pack lunch, needing leeway traffic, badge security, etc. Little stuff adds up.

I'm also less intense leaving *exactly* end day. I'll knock bit early one day bit late another depending I've already wrapped current task little finish. worry beating traffic really simplifies it.  statement also ""just true"".

There cases live. None. still social distance. people still wear masks. *That* right. country ""did right"", they'd like us, Ireland. another lockdown surge cases.

Would best children's well-being imprison room next two years? craving *braaaains*? pathological fear sunlight? epidemiologists said nothing masks cloth face coverings first 4-5 months year feel shame? .. I’m holding account inaction

Edit: (-14 pts) comment brigaded epidemiologists said nothing Jan-May masks, wanting chapter medicine go uncriticised. Hundreds thousands undetected cases... make life significantly dangerous.

Almost \~200,000 people died far. say ""those old people pre-existing conditions"" missing point. Even able-bodied person would likely die get virus, could still pass onto people, control people pass onto. Even could safe get it, could say anyone gets said, afraid normal everyday risks, makes sense afraid well.

A things. One: characterizing traffic fatalities (which assume referencing here) ""normal everyday risks"" merely observation regularity traffic fatalities. seem using words ""normal"" ""everyday"" imply regularity way acceptable, thus accept it. accept level traffic fatalities America? 


As afraid, never mentioned fear, assertion I'm afraid assumption part, implication fear, exists, unreasonable. Finally, compare COVID-19 ""everyday"" risks, many sources show deaths due COVID-19 caused expected death counts exceeded many times over. everyday risk. matter go eat? assume staying home 24/7 risk them. 37-78% incredibly month so, went haywire exactly like americans. one ever mattered, days. look daily deaths reported point throughout - they're always place. one day might twice deaths day reason all, 2 days later back half again. 7 day average gets rid noise shows trend. 

By way, 7 day average deaths US gradually declining since late August. Literally read first paragraph article immediately know what's going U.S. reported deadliest day since Aug. 26 global death toll novel coronavirus moved closer 1 million. University Oxford resuming trials experimental vaccine AstraZeneca Plc halt due participant fell ill.

I've recently diagnosed COVID (4-5 days ago, also probably also say I'm M19 preexisting medical conditions) starting experience severe pain chest breathing especially coughing. I've heard symptom taken seriously hospital visit question. Anyone relatable experience advice poor under-informed soul? Okay well, people want wear mask 24/7 that's issue. everyone forced wear totally different pair hands, accurate. Multiple prominent American Revolution historians wrote publicly dispel claim wrongly made 1619 Project. comment it? mine. Including dog go ER. Actually CanSino's Gamaleya's live attenuated vectored Ad5 vaccines, Oxford's ChAdOx1 live attenuated vectored chimpanzee Adenovirus. Also calling recombinant would correct one use Adenovirus, Adenovirus studied recombinant vaccine use multiple diseases makes vectored vaccine.

Have ever read anything besides reddit? read, son? matter profession work in, there's always one idiot made management. people disease killed, i'm sure least one person family left. America, happening everywhere. let natural selection thing. gonna free parking spots pandemic over, highways gonna open up, job opportunities. Look positives. disagree, feel could've still handled better several governments around world go blatantly state masks useless. could've said current knowledge, seem masks would help update later information available. 

At least Belgium, embarrassingly late (way studies came effectiveness masks covid), health minister kept denying masks use. result, masks mandatory various areas settings, bunch people still quoting earlier remarks masks useless saying helped, government said opposite earlier.  Cancer twenty years later? 300 million?  Every month, another 3 months gets added guys predictions over.

Next month early 2022. hope nice think that, *not* reality many uneducated ignorant folks living in. called echo chamber, we're one subreddit; like folks believe flat earth anti science bullshit one somewhere else.

When CDC Surgeon General tells wear mask going people believe especially believe ""stance changing"" part bigger conspiracy them.

Long story short, fucked response every way that's possible. Folks going respond accordingly. still understand people stocked toilet paper. Like, people shit much? Idk Ro necessarily misleading. still high Ro. 

It's statistically likely. people probably go crowded bars. Many likely work home small office spread 1-2 others. party spread disease fast. diseases country, long current administration, losing grip national infrastructure control economic ability make market pauses quickly (enough) built mask production facilities preparations ahead time. inevitable side effect slow crash empire we've living since 1970's, insufficient response this, too, example. definitely Vietnam did, essentially economic equivalent Saw-stop, crashing everything halt state political economic control keep even one person dying months pandemic, also keeping everyone housed fed. 

there's always going societal consequences things, pandemic broke me, I'm sure enough population believes society all, least unconsciously acts there's one. I'm worried nation 300 million crabs world's fanciest bucket, (including me) consciously unconsciously dragging self-preservation, even though could think layer deeper could get out. Yikes. first wanted give partner benefit doubt flu nationalist talking points combined means already made decision want be. point trying bandaid value differences go bone deep. state Republicans fighting court repeal mask mandate blaming Fauci originally saying wear masks way back medical workers needed N95.

He's explained quite clearly. poor messaging sure, get logic? brother dead win scenario spawned contracted Covid posted it, called ""A fraud, spreader false propaganda, liar, Russian operative dangerous radical"". totally empathize guy they(the deniers) believe, someone immediate family. Nothing say make difference. Seriously. shit, people decided listen first time, going change mind. America everyone. Let’s add shit, time waste. literally asking you’d rather washing hands tide pod vs straight liquid detergent control amount. know right. CCP willing sacrifice economy save people, end saving both.

GOP tried sacrificing people save economy, saved neither.

Looks like one went competent strategy one say?

Why Chinese sympathizer right things (minus initial cover Wuhan/Hebei government) disinformation attack certain countries trying shift blame due dismal performance pandemic?

But alas sympathy really required, economic result speaks themselves. China continues grow USA continues decline. speaks itself. joke? 

after 6 months ...  CDC reports?

is world run Toddlers?

\#WTFhappenedToHumanBrainsIn2020 ???? Global pandemic redundant  work, almost one back house wears mask. Front-facing interacting public, sure. keep appearances, mandated. 

But back, basically, ""screw it, want.""

Really boggles mind, I've actually brought management. Like, matter time someone back catches it, going spread like wildfire many maskless people working close proximity low-ventilation environment hours end. could easily shut many employees get infected enough people run business. One manager actually said brought chain command basically told, ""yeah, fucking bad; we're still requiring masks.""

The thing is, even require company mandate. Quite people wear masks work think hoax virus ""just flu."" I've heard several complaining seriousness virus later stating wear masks masks uncomfortable trust coworkers stay safe. 

I certainly *don't* trust coworkers safe even wearing masks. They're friends family, know first thing precautions they're taking outside work. work literally *only* time see them, see lax hell this.  We're *already* getting better this? Give fucking break lol. America total corona virus cases, twice active cases compared country 2nd active cases death, say we're already getting better this? Lol. 

The rest world, except literally 2 countries India Brazil, already put Corona virus behind them. Corona long ago they've returned normal. are, California still getting 4000+ cases daily people can't fucking keep masks on. France going towards herd immunity? I've shrugged shoulders let natural selection take course.

I’m terrified getting Covid.  sad part people think end 2020 ends, far likely outcome *2020s* time pandemic recession. Masks basically mini vaccines play DnD, take 2% buff Lol literally making blunt statements see small world. Unemployment rose 6.2 million 02/2020 20.5 million 05/2020. way, increase 3 months higher increase 2 years Great Recession. People getting unemployment Govt, say sure money pay checks majority household.

And people done whole lock shit. They're without masks fun money got unemployment. frankly, traffic everywhere restaurant packed doesnt mean mass unemployment recession. Right isnt problem. *truly* go back normal, going see major economic impact. demonstrated willing destroy economy save people

[Except GDP actually increased 2.5 percent since demostrated willing sacrifice people save [telling citizens](http://www.the-sun.com/news/378365/coronavirus-patients-welded-into-homes-in-china-as-death-toll-spirals-to-813) [to go back [is definitely like killing them](http://ibtimes.sg/videos-show-residents-being-locked-welded-inside-homes-over-coronavirus-outbreak-china-39106) [than actually locking [in apartments without food medical like CCP indeed care human life? ruling party USA?

Seems like either troll, Chinese sympathizer, hate GOP (don't worry too) enough believe China's good guy. sort aware risk, hoped economic benefits would outweigh rise cases. stands case numbers seem rising lot rapidly hoped.

Deaths low far, that's younger people becoming infected predominantly case start virus hitting elderly people care homes. everyone's able keep mingling minimal restrictions, inevitable younger people start infecting older relatives again, deaths start rising. There's kid son's class severely immunocompromised. caught flu last year landed ICU week half. parents opted go back... catches shit, he's probably going die.

 I've trying hard wrap mind around can't. right. fucking cruelty. ""Do wanna make $20,000?"" news station one-minute obituary every single American died COVID-19, would almost 139 day nonstop broadcast. That's know wear mask properly. Either get perfect seal stay indoors. fucking fault arrested? fine could nothing family rich. almost like believed bullshit 15 cases would turn 0, Covid-19 would disappear Easter like miracle.

You presume goal make things better, think that's great bet making, considering close relationship certain Russian leader. shit. can’t eat drink mask people arent distancing transmission much higher. won’t catch restaurant next year. ash burns holes mask rendering useless. wonder point America decide acceptable label teaching ‘undesirable’ profession labeling businessmen, doctors, lawyers etc. ‘desirable professions’? Idk, feel like global health catastrophe, total upheaval normal society, hundreds thousands piled body bags little stressful. wait couple weeks universities start back watch get even EVEN worse! lady work asking wearing mask virus fake gonna disappear Biden gets elected. Idc I’m one wearing mask there, work 2 jobs go college full time, get sick that’s 3 things I’m missing lot people would exposed cuz me. taking risks That's intelligent way proceed. I'm getting sick tired people making solid affirmative assertions without shred scientific insight. questions time data answer properly, attempt jump ahead sure indication agenda. Anyone says ""know"" clearly impossible know yet either liar idiot.  Wrong talking someone kill you. Wtf lost much respect Rudy especially since used leader. Yeah, went outside 3M 7502 respirator three weeks ago could sense slight weird smell. Dropped mask immediately overwhelmed wildfire smoke. I’m glad Alabama worst. literally write ""YES write several times religiously opposed possibility

I think understand problems theory possible came lab - is! 

The problem zero evidence it. think experience experience many others like certainly relevant. never claimed experience representative everybody else. I’m arguing deceptive framing article.  think so, blm antifa normally kind money Try country America. allowed 25 people long social distancing adhered Ask 19 year old squaddies. I'm sure raves start one guy buddy. hundreds show 'uninvited'. 🤔 Article mentions minimum 50% herd immunity (though one knows needs higher that) reach America would result estimated 500k 1m+ deaths?! basically — take precautions vaccine developed countries shouldn’t go herd immunity route. Good. Thank you. Nobody could seen coming Noem always said stands Donald Trump. Agreed, especially original lock downs ""flatten curve"", ramp testing effective treatments, keep hospitals traffic low, etc. Goalposts keep getting moved. protests remarkably safe overwhelmingly peaceful unlike political rallies. Probably protesters protesting peace largely wearing masks.  It’s true,no one died,numbers don’t represent people,and everything fine,nothing see here. Yeah both. Places like Texas pneumonia deaths 3 months previous year.

Ohio death rate huge gap look extras previous years, subtract covid

Question is... Besides covid, would death rate decrease (staying home, better hygiene) increase (stuck home, depression/alcohol/ domestic violence) Many people mocking NY went March/April, making jokes Cuomo etc. 200,000 dead single pathogen 7 months acceptable, however many seem okay numbers.

Here unpopular truth: America better split together. country world people wished outbreaks happen people country dislike. Nobody Beijing wished Wuhanese would die. Nobody Saxon-Anhalt wants people Thürigen get infected. Americans hand overjoyed tribe city like gets mass outbreak. Responsibility/students. think point get through. That's literally it, denying liberals win. 

They'd burn world meant liberals get use either. sickening. ""I wanna sick dick something!!"" 

""Oh, sorry sir. Carry then."" 50,000 cases per day, need 4000 days 60% US population infected. think experience represents experience everybody else? Yes. passing others wearing mask around (who seriously wears mask 24x7 home?) giving mega viral load. getting infected manner murdering entire household. Speranza, **on Covid front endure another six months** 

**The Minister: end winter safe, cure vaccine.**

AGI - ""We still keep distance, bring masks, wash hands, forever: autumn winter see light"": said Minister Health, Roberto Speranza, interview Repubblica explained ""a cure vaccine Covid close"" therefore matter ""resisting another six months"". sense, recalled EU buying package vaccines ""6-1, Astra Zeneva one six advanced stage"". return school, Hope asks put end ""unnecessary polemics"" ""it problem Minister Azzolina us"".

## ""unprecedented resources"" school

""We done European countries, one thinks situation perfect, magic wand problems Italian school born Covid. unprecedented resources, trying invest school staff equipment, provide 11 million masks day everyone free."" possible lowering quarantine seven days, Minister cautious: ""We evaluating, listen Cts first also discuss European countries"" Ahhh. b. Misunderstood. yeah, there's way concerts gone forever. People need music, bounce back. could make long, long time! :/ hosted party could told March, last shift waiting tables. think could ever again. pretty easy party all.

It's easier, fact, one.

zoom friends invite couple people low, fucking way open door others. I'm sure there's manufactured sob story here, house parties happen spontaneously. someone's house want, tell leave don't, call police. Simple. haven’t restaurant since started. finally went sat outside. servers great proper coverage. wore masks anytime someone came table. disposable things including table cover nice. saw wiping chairs people left well. tables 6 feet apart. do? 

I wear mask drive well. difficult anyone uk take coronavirus seriously lockdown 1 people locked down, missed funerals , stuck militantly told stupid lacked common sense everyone government - target young people cummings revolting hopefully lead revolting  sitting around waiting Gadot. impression government knew risk willing accept it, hence whole “eat help out” scheme. 

As far know hospitalisations deaths remained low despite cases surging last month. US tests way Europe does. realize actually remembering 2 buildings, people, everything make sense absolutely chance hell government locks like last time

 Actually, say anything nearly 200,000 mourning families America. Much like Trump. strange, like zombies taken world. I'm sure personal circumstances are, different different people.

For me, I'm single live alone really important health perspective make time socialize friends neighbors. Granted, think huge house parties crowded bars things like great idea moment, getting together 6 7 friends play games drinks like today something willing sacrifice. 

Some people (especially sub) would call selfish stupid even that, totally reject notion. Public walmart? see much days.

Public place others outside household? Absolutely. op-ed?? even sub-Reddit? Well, really. lives base, travelled Greece came back base got back pandemic also exacerbating inequalities labor division. Statistically, women housework childcare men, even work full time. Add home schooling imagine many reached boiling point. someone fair share pre-pandemic odds step help workload increased... think since there's lot asymptomatic transmission.

My friend went local chain dinner, woke high fever 3am. hospital now. test positive 5 days later that's long takes. immediate area get city like 20-30 minutes one mask one cares pandemic all. I'm sorry loss. r/titlegore many dipshits America get this. Looks like infection fatality rate may around 0.3%, least age demographic Iceland, done random testing per capita nation. also looks like 60-70% given population t-cell immunity virus--but varies country. So, let's say 0.3% 40% population could killed Covid-19; that's 0.12% entire population. U.S. that's 396,000 people. Screw volcanologists! Trust say people staying home. live mixed-use complex popular restaurant gym. gym offering outdoor classes, restaurant outdoor dining. gym hold classes today, restaurant crowded shit right long line sidewalk... Meanwhile air quality around 200 day.

When fires first started air quality close 400, restaurants still crowded. I’ve also noticing lot people walking around without masks now, pretty crazy. pandemic one thing, add piss poor air quality top it’s recipe disaster.

Oh yeah, also took drive along coast last Sunday (day labor day) drove past beaches overcrowded. got stuck traffic every single time. I'm really greatful live relatively rural part Australia. case since March/April. Everyone going lives like normal. business shut pubs, restaurants movies open albeit specific social distancing requirements reverse? Dakotas covid death rate 200/million vs. new York 1,800 / million must something right 🤷🏽‍♀️ 69 There's coroner ahead Agreed. Mask wearing almost certainly continue public spaces spread / death rate notable every day people give seeing friend, date, something. Throw winter cold rainy places prospect months isolation 

At time, impact restrictions mounting. Unless something significant happens soon, US hit head unemployment gaps, higher risk businesses closing down. Mental health substance abuse issues keep growing especially people pressured interact longer longer. Issues reduced physical activity start show course compound COVID. Sooner much later Western US burning, start questioning we're going talk climate change also mandating huge increase single use consumables, reducing shared transportation, etc.

COVID remain horrible course bumbling along month month (not US either, country keep relatively significant restrictions), believe people really start change LOT core behaviors quickly simplest solve cut across myriad problems ultimately ""normal"" aka know.

Hopefully shift mean abandon protection end like treat flu (at much higher death rate) certainly seems inevitable planning people really different attitude we're fundamentally different spot spread / vaccine / treatments come next spring. Definitely. flipside, people giving social distancing speak. people social distance either way, vaccine better nothing. Unfortunate way though. We're calling Novel coronavirus Optimally Spreading Households Intermingling Thoroughly study. first phase shit study complete, seeing repeated confirmation  Could case happening _because_ take precautions? Stupid stupid does. Hey, wanted let know less 30% citizens 18 voted current president 4 years ago. (Also less half registered voters, thanks electoral college) that's lumping 164 million us(half 328) together dumbest loudest...it perhaps incorrect assumption. Unfortunately registered voters active voters boomers, even dying covid, still outnumber millennial generation..many feel voting good.

Also, calling nation actions ""just half""(in reality less 30%) population incredibly dismissive rude acknowledged ""almost half"" describe.

(I absolutely hate leadership bigots doing, aholes refusing recognize embarrassment try actively change country take responsibility dumbest citizens really help anything gives bigots ammunition) I'd avoid indoor dining can. Wear mask social distance good though too. ... fuck need researchers publishing articles common sense? “Researchers suggest” here, noted, means proposing theory. theory yet researched yet much evidence support it. doesn’t mean it’s correct, report actual research study. right question ask is: many people without savings rainy day? course recession would send financial trouble. government cannot save people indefinitely stimulus checks. 

I've experienced time before. I've experienced layoff before. always live within means saved emergency retirement. wonder others can't willing same? vaccine isn’t cure. It’s suppress symptoms virus like flu. saw someone working target actually take mask mouth talk someone else.....as that’s need most. exacerbated problem.  Enforced it. ^^i ^^liked ^^Vista.... Sadly think blame falls cdc told people first need wear mask. went downhill that. FWIW Mike Osterholm much disagreed premise masks giving people immunity thought research incredibly weak dangerous give folks false impression mask could convey immunity. highly recommend podcast! Bananas herb! feel like let’s get shit already. it. election, pandemic, environment, economy. enough. fucking end type apocalypse things get better. can’t take 20 years starvation, civil war, death camps, militias, clean water, death, destruction, violence, misery, weather disasters, abuse, uncertainty. can’t fucking take it. Insane, stupid. Let's Covid parties ban masks! Go USA! (Sarcasm, please help) doubt that's going work out. suspect pre-producing millions tens millions doses vaccines. vaccine gets approval, tens millions doses easily find users, still anywhere near close enough vaccinate everyone.

Unfortunately that's perfect environment political economic pressure get tens millions vaccine doses approved. Maybe, maybe not... surely little incentive make shorter So, son never left house ever since March? Really?

PS. mask-wearing? eat restaurants live wear mask take sit down. cinemas bars. School open. Actually highschool closed two weeks hybrid learning. We’re full time Monday. I’m fucked. thinking local piercing/tattoo place worst even way adapt new sales methods like remote, delivery, etc.  People hard time answering simple questions lately. Antibody tests suggest [21% NYC residents 21% 8.4 million guess?

Certainly wiggleroom number clear *a lot* people spread without knowing. Fauci smart actually cared human beings, would recommending people SCIENCE says do.... GET VITAMIN PEOPLE!

So many studies coming saying important vitamin prevent treat make sure covid infection get severe. 

Yet, Fauci vested interest vaccines one goong take vaccines everyone took vitamin put stop pandemic. 

The tragic pandemic gets, higher chance people take vaccine. 

You know old saying. money!!! look Florida Europe data? school shut two weeks hybrid. We’re going back Monday I’m pretty sure human right mind *chooses* bombed.

My point given choice socially distancing socializing, humans eventually opt latter. know reporting huge backlog deaths, right? government health workers responsible overwhelmed. addition, death certificates sometimes delayed weeks months. one part liking party's ideals one part wanting defend ideals (which party subscribes party attacks). certain viewpoints one choice leads ""single issue voters."" voters support given candidate others support party/platform voting candidate requirement support party/platform broken families, that's great society...

They already broken, admitted yet. Maybe society stop pushing marriage family people? everyone cut it. get it, tell many jobs restaurants want trade many lives, suffering disabilities. 

I'm even rhetorical, I'm literally serious. obviously number there, since value one life infinitely. use resources save one person, would destroy society.


But one brings business job losses willing tell number is. hide behind ""but jobs tho"" refuse tally up, arguing facts, numbers, nothing.

Tally then. Tell us many lives much suffering disease willing trade many bars restaurants closing. One bar one life? 5 bars? appraised value bar including payroll let's say 2 years? could make three. 

I know numbers know EPA's numbers. tell dollar value I'll respect opinion agree disagree. matter opinion can't argued against. value human life much value much. argument necessary.

But going cowardly refuse disclose dollar value human life suffering (what truly agonizing, slow, suffocating death) opinion based denial hiding truth choice. 

Anyone wants restaurants bars full indoor dining despite public health cost/externality say yes indeed external costs absorbed public including death/morbidity much believe public pay. State terms stop hiding behind average persons innumeracy. smelling burnt toast there? talk Kind masks (one ply more)? need biostats homework put afternoon. second read academic paper go multiple rabbit holes. sealed beans refried, rice really soft/broken. Meat mushy. open everything dried shit

If regular bowl normal ingredients gonna everything stew like. Think jambalaya left stove rice trying turn porridge. 

Why even bother point? make throwup cheaper. point, correct, especially country issue achieving compliance.

But asked ""effective"" lockdown looks like. That's looks like.

The larger point need adopt long term mentality. Japan, treated lockdown like preparatory stage. Now, reopening goal keeping contacts reduced much 80%, even though economic activity resumed. closures, effective public messaging, new social patterning, adequate preparation infrastructure supplies. Meanwhile US, something like 60% available testing still takes two weeks complete, making functionally worthless.

I get people antsy reopen. Especially see horrific numbers like these. ***But economic outcomes tied public health outcomes.*** long case numbers suck ass, able recover economically. way avoid this. mean whatever effective stupid people know wear masks. work retail environment shall remain nameless. Today, someone came wearing gloves protect Covid touching products. mask well nose, talked even slipped upper lip.

In popular well-shopped store (that even ""essential"" never closed) amazing many people grasp concept. Yeah let's forget part reddit ""no mask"" circle jerk begin year. Plenty bs thread sub science sub anti mask bs. took second understand trying say.

Hope enjoying hits much :) yet living near major college it’s matter time.  clean seats, railings, everything routes choice wouldn’t ride. keep upvoting good info! It’s fucking commenter asked co-morbidities 50 year old infectious diseases doctor died Covid. Yes, I'm aware actions crew outside largely case every man himself.

And, society worth event vulnerable sacrificed, whatever economic cost. ramifications course action would incalculable long-lasting. need form army? learn wear masks wait till humanity wipe  10 day literally cdc guideline. ya bro, understand medical either. 

It take longer 10 days train new person. Fact. 

I going doctor too! Omg crazy right? work hospital wife practitioner. think know little billing champ. paying that, get new doctor. shows sure. Chief Medical Officers UK, come across bit professional Fauci change views every weeks, say Spring 2021 see return normal way life. good you, no? keep wearing mask let others achieve herd immunity expense health. Extra teachers hired classes could divided three groups, breaks staggered, class assigned specific toilets and, possible, learning done outside.

These sound lot like social distancing too... believe patriotism comes straight president really foolish. joined Marine Corps 9/11 would done matter president was. I'd wager vast majority volition. one protests? I’ve couple masks far between. 3/10 people wearing tops, end they’ve pretty much shed too. Sounds like Netherlands... pattern. fire pit analogy, affected fire? use creationists, closest left. Why? inside RV way US wear high quality (N95 better) mask way Florida, odds getting infected squarely zero. virus magically infect second step US soil. california top dog highest cases, getting deaths  word spelled ""pagan"", professor. Lmao. 7 day average Britain time 3 deaths. Deadly would use describe pandemic right now, outside ""hot spots"" works, instead developing vaccine? Thanks, harm done. safe. countries probably cheaper Florida.

When kids Florida convenient. Well said. realize cardiac MRIs cheap, would interesting test 26 negative testing athletes time. 

Myocarditis is, say rare cold flu. also caused steroid stimulant use, really stress including excessive exercise. get enjoyment torturing pedos. fact, use torture sake torture.

It ok torture pedos advancement science medicine. maybe wanted hang fun friends? 19 year old college...

I get probably don’t go parties shit, seriously, $10k? Y’all would lose fucking minds black kid got fined much similar crime. God hope lot people don’t kids. idea navigate life, full risks. I’m glad parents raised way did. countries borders closed right now. Canadian choices Florida, Mexico, Brazil Ecuador. tons COVID care that. curiosity, use small doses live virus vaccinate people works? it’s inherently riskier unconfirmed? Could test kind immunization regular flu strains? something like worked 50% large enough scale, might change vaccinate develop vaccines forever? Or—again—is risky ever rely on? answer question would assume way risky assume wide scale—too many people would still get sick even many didn’t developed immunity, right? Double? Pretty sure that's triple quadruple areas.  There’s huge PPE shortage back March corona shit hit US, wanted preserve masks healthcare providers front line workers. believe that’s constantly claimed masks didn’t work even tho clearly working expected China. wouldn’t blame authorities officials I’d say enough PPEs required citizens wear masks public, tens thousands lives could’ve saved. masks may function like vaccine respiratory diseases reduce viral load much body learns fight it? Why....why idea come sooner? true, almost seems like brainier. They’re going super butthurt realize need mask anyways can’t breathe due smoke! Many Canadian clients fled back April. It’ll interesting see return winter. Portland worst air quality world right now. right lmao. serve too! Years ago. work hospital covid every day. interact patients, wear n95 papper hood. ya man, selfish people wearing cloth masks they're actively eating.....

I dont even go eat. covid either. year period I'd bet I'm 10 times going eating 

Enjoy hysteria nice life living terror letting little virus completely consume life. Unlike US, believe ""Live Free Die"". country freedom. idea look like, I’m chick, I’m non-binary don’t like people lie, I’m making sure people know you’re liar. Sad true... went back gym almost two months ago I’m aware risk. wear mask protect others. mental health risks ten times greater that’s need worry now. friend who's uncle died covid recently posted something Facebook saying ""If one ever told covid existed, would even noticed?"" replied first friends said ""yes? Didnt uncle die it? people family/friends died long term serious health issues, definitely noticed"". 

Her friends said attacking said would died anyway (from genetic issue killed father...not exactly sure came play ok). ended unfriend 25 years friendship much. Oh sister thanked thinking uncle. Yeah, Fauci constantly talks life won’t go back normal another year people stop listening him. also host private party house without restrictions, different situation believe lockdowns way go. Masks distancing good habits pause crowd-events is, really things would virtually painless recovery this. 

&amp;#x200B;

You right, death problem Covid infection. masks seems likely people get wearing mask get light version. 

&amp;#x200B;

All companies shut down, supply line issues, job losses, would prevented everyone mandated masks beginning. haven’t.

Don't get wrong; i'm going there. mathematically, way guys acting, possible forest fire runs fuel vaccine arrives. I’m living right dude. I’m fucking depressed. I’m fucking jealous everyone got enjoy college. I’m fucking upset I’m getting carefree years. I’m fucking upset can’t fun last year boyfriend undergrad together goes grad school. I’m extrovert I’m fucking lonely. college, one friends ever said ""I'd like teach, "" they'd raise hands say "" know, know, go debt order make nothing?"" they'd heard family peers Always people jokes stories like come up, even though see first-hand goes animals I'm sure would find distressing. No, SOuth Korea experiencing second ""wave."" goddamn ""wave."" kinda understand sentiment. 10k debt really joke 19 year old linger time, especially come low income family. honestly dislike fines based income anyways. 

But again, could argue 10k fair regards risk taken. one person ended infected party, potential damage line (down infection chain, break it) could absolutely disastrous even end death others. shitty decision hundreds thousands millions Britons making day

I really think hundreds thousands millions Britons hosting 50 person indoor parties every get 60 people busy nandos ffs

For workplaces allowed open, comply Covid secure procedures. think smaller fine would get message across. That’s pay full year college. Kid gonna seriously set back life family doesn’t means pay it. unemployment runs out?

Fun fact: United States government cannot run money. vaccine know possible yet...

it 2 weeks flatten curve... 

but yeah let's give young naive kid 10k fine, destroyed economy, unaffordable rents mental anguish going enough burden him. r/Selfawarewolves I'll steal great comment myself, thank much! exactly make people stop listening you, constantly saying normality won’t come back 2021 going cause good amount people stop taking precautions. attendees well, get medical help real blockbuster currently real life.  That’s smarter may realize. doubt, get tested. Stay clear people, especially risk people, results. Inform exposed decide want get tested. 

My husband tested positive. went got tested next day, friday. tested negative. got another test following Monday test came back positive. test, test, test. That’s advice. Good luck! “iTs iNcReAsE StOcK” crowd anti-vaxx crowd went college.

Really it’s embarrassing anti-vaxx crowd, know spew garbage onto internet. Maybe look differently. could drive Alaska, hire kind cargo boat drive Vladivostok, navigate Siberia, China, etc. would require can-do attitude. think stay home. I’m people able say whatever want long use /s 

I think it’s unrealistic think slapping 10K fine 19 year old going discourage 19 year olds thing . Parties parties bro shit gonna happen /s short sighted thinking.

Do think going die graduate. Life college black white work experience. grateful dont dont chronic lung problems result it. type business run interest? Sorry hear struggles really annoys business owners zero help.

There still new grants floating around depending area &amp; industry you’re in. death rate much, much lower though - definitely resurgence among less impacted populations. unemployment runs out? Wishing things change right matters cant make rent. Everyone attending fined also. Awesome. Please tell you’re qualified make decision. teacher? give links published research educational strategies? 

Or person making uninformed decision based experience student you’ve read internet? 

Also, didn’t even address main part comment, schools help spread disease. Online teaching COURSE preferable “normal” school, sure way keep disease spreading.

Edit: also, jobs remotely. We’ve literally weeks. it’s clearly jobs remotely, haha brings right back awesome area curve smaller? Yes, trick going getting ""things better, life go back normal"" EVERYONE across world experiencing. Man, covid really hates restaurants bars 🙄  lol minimum wage? One largest producers world starts $19/hr ~$23/hr. I’m talking one plant either. Lmao would endgame people wearing masks? point doesn’t make sense, even it’s true.  know expert said masks alone would control pandemic. 

All reputable experts agree need to: wear quality mask public; wash hands frequently well; maintain social distancing; avoid crowds, especially indoors. Maybe monkeys escaped ran masks. Moderna (the currently leading vaccine candidate maker) never brought product market before. I’ll keep eye cat. Yes, people sub say “those extra millions deaths Covid” restaurants closed since March stayed closed least Biden takes power. know you’re ugly hamster chick stalking grades supposed mingle other.

That's form social distancing. Denmark apparently averages 19 pupils per class. applaud Denmark better school system UK. 

But one generalise headline countries crowded schools. would government lie virus? tinfoil hats need open eyes understand government side. Jeez Republicans using term excuse let poor suffer die. fact “living within means” silly statement days. 50% Americans live paycheck paycheck. Untold thousands die affording healthcare. Medical bankruptcy number 1 reason bankruptcy. new jobs starvation jobs. server, got shitheads like ones dining out. Covid brought worst people (i.e you) hiding general public.

Any fun found serving pre-covid destroyed soon returned one table 150 wore mask whenever stopped table.

Fuck you. mean standing around outside wearing masks don’t think police would gotten involved. accurate analogy would fire pit. small fires big fires that’s expected. can’t afford locking next summer. economy already shambles continued lockdown make worse. goal point lock elderly comorbidities making sure hospitals don’t become overwhelmed. Fuck teen. locked up. Everybody party needs tested.  start scientists aware primary source transmission airborne. original comment's wrong since cardiovascular means heart *and* blood vessels (unless specific). GOP pushing legal protections corporations COVID lawsuits. someone standing rights put dent bottom line. haven’t. mean possibility u carry virus like herpes since allready knew wrong party 

This exactly point. We're global pandemic. *Don't throw big fucking parties* 

Actions, meet consequences. need French Revolution / workers uprising. ultra rich terrified us. frankly shocked still alive. It’s like people think don’t bleed. whole post dumb. ""Passing time causes events occur triggered passing time!"" Excellent screensaver need reminding need keep public health safety measures. SARS contained, feel like would eventually became less powerful... I'm pretty sure that's happened too, since clearly much lethal beginning. difference symptom display definitely played part... cannot think without comparing differences government response. Canada, least, part 2003. lucky US get hit all.  article gives much hope stop injecting bleach shining light various orifices? lol saw funny video, friend sharing screen dont link guy yelling like Call cops! infecting wearing mask! actual thought reverse true people wearing mask breathing air making sick said mask wearer breaking law getting people sick asking take getting really close face yelling top lungs thats crazy. I’ve never understood people could eat Peeps. Explain lockdowns would affect recovery rate. Recovery requires actually caught illness...

You also neglect fact countries highest deaths per capita strict lockdown. say her? Unless dog death’s door, would’ve left ughhhh Left right, nitwits. Numerous. must missing something. saw 1 link metro paper, exactly known hard hitting journalism.

You right, source. antidotal, fact live China know hundreds people hubei, understand count evidence one thing I've learnt last 9 months much complete shit Western news publishes China.

I'm fan ccp happily talk shit many crap things done years, Western media writes China often comical. I'm sure said many times news can't trusted, yet choose believe must true China. people even care truth. chose support something stick defend it/find everything fits narrative. 

(As long upvoted right)  Oxford nearly went bin? What? complete bullshit making elephant mouse. temporarily paused potential side effect might happened, test 1000+ people atleast bound already issues happen surface vaccination, importantly, it, good vaccination sure vaccination cause bad timing issue already surfacing indepentdently. temporary pauses common vaccination research indicate going bin all, stop bullshit. I'm quarantine moment cause I've found positive virus. get back taste smell? really weird able smell taste anything. Think I've lost 3-4 days ago. COVID virus surprisingly stable. Apparently typical viruses transferred new species host.

Not article: scientists said test tube cultured viruses exhibit certain inevitable properties virus show. Stupid hicks... mean it. 

As country, we're coddling states essentially actively killing people. States cooperating, opening earlier etc delaying more, KILLING people. 

Start withholding federal aid non compliant states. beyond absurd now. Pissed post removed? TP running late Feb, early Mar, ""Optional Shutdown"" happened. suggesting preexisting conditions may worsened effects covid diminishes impact value 200,000 deaths, mention tens thousands extra flu pneumonia deaths?

Not trying put words mouth. Please explain mean that. informed comment attorney another People born late around 1960 scar get hopes up. Unfortunately, sounds exactly like wishful thinking.

In intentions means well, I've never seen someone vulnerable internet misinformation. sad. guess matter source gets front page particular story. Sometimes UK site, sometimes US. Yeah. point correlation vs. causation. 

It’s easy fall trap one measure, masks, thing explains everything. 

This virus deserves respect that. Yes, people home get full dose virus them, since maskless (at home)? BS. 

On totally unproven hypothesis came lab China, never know CCP allow it. never totally unproven hypothesis.

The CCP would destroyed every shred evidence already December. Burned evidence killed everybody knows it. killed people burned evidence people killed scientists. burned evidence burned evidence. burned things, case.

So goes nowhere. 

It's people want make interesting talk this. Nothing else ever happen saying ""We need know bla bla"".

It's easy make self interesting talk stuff know nobody ever proove wrong right. stay role forever somebody claiming important ideas. thank least admitting possibility. put best anyone here. 

To automatically claim suspicions coronavirus result human intervention point, ""conspiracy"" ""magical thinking"" rather bald attempt shut discussion highly-likely circumstance; additionally, attempt correlate belief highly-likely circumstance automatically anti-social behavior order steer away discussion it. 

that's freaks it. think that's unlikely happen. unimaginable, unlikely. Except know large number Americans selfish assholes would hoarded masks resold massive profit like toilet paper idiots. I'm upset doubling down, FedEx 32,000 planes don’t. people kids shouldn’t kids. many people. Fuck that. Honestly. What's point even alive never go except limited circumstances stay 6 feet apart everyone else wearing mask? see point myself. bother even trying vaccine fiesn't change anything?

You may happy live rest life socially distancef dystopia suspect vadt majority people won't. goes everything makes us human quite frankly, uttetly insane virus even deadly. forgetting march april widespread elderly homes majority deaths elderly, that's case - yet. cannot produce evidence  sad probably spot this. People care way much people's opinions would rather risk lives feel liked. Besides wife girls care less people think we've masking since February

EDIT: word clarity You’re right; lockdown indeed caused death despair. needs come end. 

There exists evidence support lockdown. governed rash, hysterical decisions. Could single shred evidence escaped lab?

Could many things possible, single shred evidence for? 

Should interested things possibly happened somewhere, absolutely reason us think actally happened?

he works mysterious ways Specifically -- Caputo, top HHS spokesman, said interview Saturday one advisers seeking greater scrutiny CDC’s weekly scientific dispatches, known Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report, past 3½ months. adviser, Paul Alexander, sent repeated emails CDC seeking changes demanding reports halted could make emails, first reported late Friday Politico, describe CDC documents, widely known MMWR, “hit pieces administration.” Caputo confirmed authenticity often, MMWRs [issued] purely scientific reasons,” Caputo said Saturday. “But election year, time covid-19, it’s longer unanimously scientific. There’s political content.”   Jesus... same. I’m paramedic firefighter. assholes letting conservative beliefs affect belief science medicine. say don’t tell non-mask wearers this. obviously weren’t going wear mask goodness hearts protect others argument presented, fuck ‘em.  happens already virus wearing mask? body/lungs designed expel harmful environmental elements. Herd immunity absolutely goal get back normal also say new normal. large anti lockdown protests Germany Australia recently, hundreds arrested. expect another fucked US, maybe I'm cynical ¯\\(°_o)/¯ stop there, get moderate case it, try spread word it. 

Ive came similar. problem claim hyperbolic bullshit. Nobody left without food true low level authorities locked people thier apartments. people consistent quarantine breakers, many countries put people jail. higher authorities found happening thier doors unlocked, usually within day two, most.

See, call post bullshit included numerous non-government written sources back claims, yet repeating CCP rhetoric without listing single reputable source. Thank sharing this! listened episode week. scary seeing top subreddit. exactly Osterholm afraid article would do. I'll interested read rebuttal. Lol wtf learning school son? Oh wow.. must really painful. I’ve got partially collapsed lung related pregnancy complications had, covid scares too. Makes understand better resistance, they’re antivax! Cost living also thing. Minimum wage (or slightly above) would put apartment least 2-3 incomes coming keep afloat. end working things jobs things careers, emergency savings retirement bit harder come by.

We're already seeing employers take advantage overflow people looking work driving wages requirements up. Non-technical trade skill oriented jobs going hit hard next years super sucks. Middle class going bore brunt worst ways.

The goal keep businesses people afloat got handle pandemic could survive eventually thrive we're barely achieving thriving. pushes next year, there's going ton fallout without government intervention. Donny does. Imagine everyone wore GOOD masks everyone else many minorities mask mouth nose mask chin actually covering anything mask all.

Uh... seem little eager imply minorities wearing masks wearing improperly. blame mask thing white Karens, assure you-its white karens town. like 90% entire populace 

No, I'm blaming conservatives. Republicans lot Democrats would considered conservative, especially anyone far left like me. anything like testing, start slow become much widely available next month initial release early days, public advised wear mask sick. based science around SARS1, people started infectious show symptoms. COVID turned different, approximately 40% infections came people felt perfectly healthy time. advice changed ""wear mask sick"" ""wear mask, might sick.""

All pre-Covid evidence pointed masks mostly beneficial protecting people around you. evidence non-medical masks protect wearer emerge much later. known N95 masks *do* protect wearer, public discouraged buying them, trained wear properly cannot ramp production fast enough keep demand healthcare workers, higher priority, lot staff get sick healthcare collapse, mortality skyrocket across groups. ""please buy much toilet paper"" plea work, reason think plea buying medical grade masks would worked. retrospect, focused better recommendations around re-using surgical masks, smaller supply keep larger number people protected. evidence surgical masks work nearly well N95s outside hospital environment. still considered un-nessecary public wear N95s, difference surgical masks big enough justify increased difficulty correct wearing. poorly fitted N95 significantly less protective properly worn surgical mask, see Table 5 fact, pre-Covid randomized controlled trial fabric masks - randomized trials gold standard scientific data - showed cloth masks work might harmful. See 
In retrospect, study poorly designed, control group ""no mask"" group, instead ""choose mask"" group considered unethical ask nurses wear masks around sick patients. instead comparing nurses wore cloth mask nurses wore masks, compared nurses wore cloth masks nurses may may wearing medical masks, surprising cloth masks group got sick. bad study one policies made. much better evidence indicate cloth masks work.

In short, think happened authority said ""there evidence healthy people wear masks"" telling truth, meant non-N95 masks, thorough, would said : "" evidence non-N95 work, want buy N95s, people need plus work without fit test. please follow current guidelines wait research non-N95 masks, underway."" probably could done better job consider dishonesty. Fucking make many stupid people days mention apes telling us hur dur dur, boil face everytime touch mask. Like mask somehow sponge takes tiny virus things in. Shit, boil clothes aswell everytime come home. Yup, gonna wearing long-term. Also, looking forward stockpile masks. CDC said IFR .69% month ago, number move around time differ county county. also adjust update/compute/estimate excess deaths infection rates including asymptomatic. super cool data. sort might expect, cool see qunaitified like that.

But side note presentation data. tried presenting without connecting lines? took quite figure lines connecting data points. think might clear without lines. contain meaningful information really. in, day day variations really matter here, lines connecting weekdays weekends really stand, highlighting anything meaningful. second thought kind oscillation going on, even reading callouts weekdays weekends. Unconnected dots might clear all.

If wanted get extra fancy lines, maybe show trend lines: one weekdays post-covid, one weekends post-covid. (You would ungroup weekday weekend data it, could worth it.) need trend lines pre-covid variation pre-covid obviously unrelated we're interested in. trend lines weekdays weekends post-covid might show gradual easing later earlier waking times, could interesting.

Also, graph tall one x axis bottom, might clear shade alternating months. hard see months begin end scanning bottom.

Anyway, super cool stuff. Thanks sharing. Antivaxxers objectively dumber people know vaccines work. I'd worry less karma moron. never made sense important healthcare workers masks general public. Health government officials contributed lot death lying. dispatch got exposed first time. mask policy infection happened hid everyone directly exposed. person lied wear mask. real kicker came back work finally testing negative would still wear mask chin. lessons learned. Yeah sure, try holier form start next time. Facebook happened Sarah Gilbert, one developers Oxford vaccine, college-age triplets enrolled trial. go home can't stay South Dakota able keep testing? people virus getting tested think hoax? trust numbers reported accurate truthful? many variables making blanket statements like simply possible.  Seems like yesterday recommending wear masks. recall check (I wearing mask) doctor said OK really necessary, though really hand sanitiser (this around March, America). hoax? No, see IFR exceptionally low “long term“ damage propose unique coronavirus. see lives crumbling result method see comeback great many individuals. 

Your belief virus eradicated one flawed here. Spread occur masked individuals. mask.  Hang kiddo. exact time line also felt like gorilla sat chest. I'm finally feeling better. Listen body. You’ve misinterpreted point. nice day. country 

And Sweden. Western vaccines work.

I'm however sure US capabilities successfully distributing it, deploying vaccination campaigns, actually managing whole operation considering records past months. $10 bonkers. Check ebay alibaba. I’m getting KN95s 85 cents. FDA list companies models. ever paid $2 includes shipping China. Based pre-pandemic prices, definitely don’t cost 20 cents make. Anyone charging $10 price gouging life saving PPE ought harshly punished. Italy hammered beginning. seeing reemergence. It’s obvious vaccine slow down. Stop blaming US inevitable. We’re March-May lockdowns necessary states , there’s scenario stomps virus?

Yes, they're seeing reemergence got cases way down. time first outbreak what's happening we've got better understanding disease, better treatments we're along way vaccine. lockdowns spread would continued unabated, vastly people would infected died likely hospitals would overrun. people would died uncontrolled spread alive tough measures brought then. 

You seem saying anything stomp virus useless, that's true. Anything slows spread buys us time learn disease get closer vaccine. dunno... 100% agree point, people went absolutely nuts toilet roll, never suggestion need usual.


If said ""masks help buy yet medics need them"" think would mad rush shortage.


If people could relied upon act like logical, reasonable human beings would agree... think year shown absolutely can't problem claim hyperbolic bullshit. Nobody left without food die.

It's true low level authorities locked people thier apartments. people consistent quarantine breakers, many countries put people jail. higher authorities found happening thier doors unlocked, usually within day two, most. vulnerable, keep distancing  facemasks 

None three things happening. interests interest humanity align. course. idiots saying ""Well, proof"" ""It's theory"" like are, decide default position take wear mask there's incontrovertible proof beyond doubt, never happen anything. 

For me, reason keep wearing masks. *is* true, I'm benefiting. true, I'm hurting myself. health benefits coffee:

Anyway, great day stay safe. could never partner took unnecessary risks. people know partner? Cook Humans lol We've got today. get excited. don’t understand. hospitals buy supplies Home Depot Walmart? always thought bought supplies directly company “medical supply” middle man, case would simple sell medical supplies hospitals, individuals.  case vulnerable elderly, take point. Society isn’t much good left fend tough times. 
I defend honor titanic captain Edward Smith however, prevented mass panic, stopped men shoving way lifeboats (he brandished shotgun this) went ship.

They're essentially disregarding feelings dumb spiritual beliefs. Call directly. thing. think enough people socially distancing, working home possible, wearing masks, sanitizing spaces, etc right. hit peak everyone carrying normal life spreading like wildlife NYC.

We're long slow burn though... Take shit down. mask protective spready ""this one single study suggests"" ""you immune COVID-19"" dangerous experience, NEJM publish anything tbh I’d rather something like mono yet idiots still refuse wear.

My hunch calling people ""idiots"" really gonna help make case.... go school tomorrow. I'm kinda scared ngl Yay, reason wear mask benefits Got peer reviewed paper back opinion up? said objectively, let’s see data. wasnt confusing messaging. outright lie. herd immunity! Period. Remember many deaths Sweden had, versus Norway Denmark? sure worse many countries putting similar people jail.

Again, go hospital locked apartment? go buy food? 
 saying press exaggerated claims like people left die without food.

I guess pandemic hit, China suddenly able coordinate food deliveries Hubei's 50+ million residents simultaneously? joking? Thats believing China efficient government, that's believing Santa Claus.  Don’t think is. sleep window open, could allergies? ending mid 2021 Oh look, could reason Tell PGDW. It’s nothing less infuriating. yesterday, flew Rome back NYC guy ass line customs. Even tape floor distance measurements still felt necessary top me. put hand go “six feet”. back off. people tell ya. poor man, unbelievable heartache stress must feel watching unfold.
I would want quit run hills. fucking try it, start study let us know theory, hypothesis. important delineate two, otherwise leads bunch chodes saying shit like, ""evolution theory!"" theory best explanation possible known phenomenon based evidence, continues validated new evidence. Mandating masks shutting things stop spread WI started recall Gov Evers

Yep. Taking pro life stance republican WI gets him, hopefully not, recalled. 

My take away pandemic can’t help stupid  Well, Covid toes apparently thing.

The taint? need wait future. Imagine Asian country people casually wear mask go outside, public transport, work. I'm one people I'm completely baffled huge mask debacle. hope people wrote ""masks bad give false sense security"" experts write apology newspaper... video show people locked thier apartments left die. shows tragically couple old folks collapsed home died. also shows authorities checking them, unfortunately looks it, late. doubling would 36,000 planes Jokes aside, seriously, something caffeine addiction. go cold turkey yourself, I'm saying something might wanna bring next time see doctor, whenever is. Yet another foreseeable failure pandemic planning 😣 much idea schools opening ruin children's education. open without vaccine result worse. That’s basic tribalism. People know mostly good people anyway know reasons bad ones got way. People outside Other, perceived (incorrectly Dakotas) forcibly taking away community’s resources via unnecessary taxes spent “free” services “bad people”. 

Basic human psychology—and political system yet means alleviate reality. Politically “liberals” comfortable helping Other, equally tribal policies think everyone follow. 

The solution probably better education, education problem locals don’t particularly want it. (I’m Arkansas—trust one). 

The option simple dialogue, one key things talking limiting amount propaganda willing accept society.  Joseph Goebbels would recognize many ideas American entertainment, particularly right wing “news” talk radio. Hey gang, spent first night quarantine last night back USA. flew Italy end February attend funeral, literally day things really took there. 7 months go I’m back. I’m minus job know I’m alone. Shouldn’t surprising Spanish flu took 2 years work way population. good news almost half way there.

For us take seriously, it’s good reminder stay disciplined focused... CDC totals 9/12 192,388 deaths. Look, random dude Reddit, little math head, almost exactly right CDC significant amount. people criminally negligent data predictions. I’m sorry you’re deal that. It’s really disappointing find someone trusted isn’t thought were. Or, could come stronger better country learning acting upon never happen again.

Pandemics happen, corrupt bungling responsible many deaths ruin need never happen again. Old name national park:

Ahh yes, GTA approach missions follow laws? consider laws infringing freedom choices? follow government instruction daily compliance live society. follow traffic laws, rights infringed? government one making traffic laws, ""blindly complying"" rules? drive like maniac freedom choose? course, could choose drive laws, GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE might stop you! pull cop gets behind lights? consider ""blind compliance""?

Also, literally list one downside wearing mask besides uncomfortable. Look around world, history. Masks accepted constantly used protective equipment. There's blind compliance, sensible acceptance something OBVIOUSLY good idea! Much like good idea wear seatbelt, drive speed limit.

There's actual sinister stuff government doing. Stop getting riled new rule makes total sense. Look legit corruption exploitation want something outraged about, there's PLENTY. Anti maskers close understanding, sinister entities trying control us, getting fixated masks distracts understanding truth.  Speaking chicken pox, it’s amazing lifetime went thing everyone got go (I got 5 years old remember sucked pretty hard) vs get vaccine avoid completely. Science! explain mild symptoms/asymptomatic presentation people masks mandated? 

Oh, that's right, anecdotes != data. I'm assuming Brit, must know merits links posted. 

But, I'm saying people locked thier apartments. I'm even really trying defend it, terrible thing happen. I'm sure worse many countries putting similar people jail. saying press exaggerated claims like people left die without food. """"""refugees"""""" Right. wearing masks beginning government lied effectiveness, community looked mask wearing ridiculous. modicum common sense enough know masks could help. many seemingly intelligent people still refuse wear masks. one bright light Covid many virus spreading idiots dying. Go Darwin! simple google search bring back plenty credible results negative long term health effects covid. sound like one researchers whose funding could threatened public backlash.

No don't. 

I sound like rational person rational.

You like rational this, invested emotions completely baseless lack substantial amount evidence would clearly indicate animal origin

We need that. Viruses origin amimals TIME.

There absolutely zero mystery happening 1000th time. can't easily falsify possibilities

You understand science work.

It easy make 1000 unfalfifiable possibilities like lab origin theory.

Science works ignoring theories neither proove disproove - like lab origin theory - go working serious stuff actually get somewhere.

Like find meteor impact crater go ""OMG aliens drop meteor! cannot proove serious theory!"" odd I-don't-trust-her Hong Kong whistleblower claims smoking gun lab-origin evidence release soon.

She release anything. anything.

She's trying make money PR.

Like claim footage Loch Ness Monsters talking aliens release ""soon!"" never relases it, keep dangling secret evidence garner attention.

Wow man, make money selling photos took log dark, say ""this bad photos event saw. see, there's SOMETHING WATER!"".

Anybody actually evidence serious. release evidence FIRST, action starts.

People start claiming evidence release nothing, con men do.

If tolerance brings number ""potentially 0%"" insignificant ineffective, remind fellow citizens CV still threat must never talk (when actually hear someone behind mask) think anything CV?

There needs numerical tolerance usefulness, 1% it. That's perfect.. Well guy's grandma, used take sores infected person, grind snort powder... Yes. article says -2% cases active, leaving another -2% dead. never said masks bad. early real shortage PPE hospital workers want people going buying panic like already toilet paper hand sanitizer. /r/UnexpectedOffice Well, Boomers Facebook anyway. OG Facebook would’ve still posting pics children cats. people stupid selfish assholes. putting others *severe* danger, they're prolonging actual return normal.

If good citizens nitpicked haircuts politics, could back 100% normal August. No, September, right now, *August*. could opened schools safely everywhere, simply crushed curve listening health experts like Dr. Fauci, politicians like Trump.

The coronavirus might cost us last school year, poor management coronavirus cost us year.

Meanwhile Sweden, everybody cares less politics socially distances part culture, cases dropping. often see Sweden used example success without lockdown, kind stupid, would *never* work European countries, much less America, Swedes locked down! need sorts crazy restrictions, obey health precautions themselves!

It precisely kind attitude prevents us getting back ""normal"" sooner. Angry skeptics wave fists air, criticizing official health advice insisting open *now* reason. Go figure. infects brain cells make believe real wear mask. anti mask protest started lol That’s human airway; virus virions red bits. someone share % positivity reflects? Thanks! wouldn’t call 10k new cases day “under control”. they'll take article use ""proof"" masks work saying ""See?! still get wearing mask, bother?!"" ability spin agenda that's worrying. People wearing masks isn’t American issue. Nobody wearing I’m UK mandated. Even now, people still wearing them. Im sorry guys getting paid? Yeah makes sense, trying convinced, agenda masks, remember done U turn said masks ineffective take away ‘trust one.’ Misinformation authoritative medical sources means.. I’m sure puts us now. Actually it’s stuff like fuels conspiracy crazies .. come back haunt us. 34 states mask mandates. Georgia fully open months now, mask mandate. They’re still fine. hospitals aren’t overwhelmed, case numbers downward trend since July. Muuuuhhh freeeedooom Yes....35% Americans care nothing else except themselves, $$$$ maybe tiny bit kids!!!! propaganda I’m ok - wearing piece cloth face could help move thing along I’m everyone one guy mask lost. Yeah dont hear people refuse wear masks saying ""they dont help experts told so"", hear ""masks affront liberty liberal plot take away muh freedom!"" Actually, no. world-renowned expert Dr Anthony Fauci stated lock downs unnecessary long people comply simple public health precautions: wear mask public, avoid crowded places, maintain social distance, wash hands frequently thoroughly. whew, good timing Thanks pulling key points.

One point article, posted it, perfectly credible researcher trouble subtle censorship. source human interest article (admittedly, news/society story, scientific journal entry) perfectly credible, mainstream publication.

So, there's really valid reason censor article, therefore, re: point discussion faced subtle censorship, worth posting, viewing discussion.

But, aware human interest story, scientific paper. point topic really censored. Watch social dilemma documentary netflix mask debacle makes lot sense fancy way saying, ""that asserted without evidence dismissed without evidence"". too. mid-20's, solid everywhere, like rock.

Great music back then. go eat wife people work with. people reading son't consider details. hear ""that's average number 1 person infect"" makes missleading. sure went school learn math, yes really true. Even triple number covid cases round 20M, that’s still less half number flu cases saw 2019-2020 flu season. two weeks! Ty I've reading much t-cell seen single article estimating 60-70% preexisting response. source? common cold strains caused coronaviruses, estimates I've seen 20-30%. You’re response satisfying, concise informative article.  Lots countries didn’t mask mandates quite well. fact, American mask-wearing rates average throughout duration compared countries without prior cultures mask-wearing. lot people don’t know media focuses people don’t wear masks. went eat first time since March recently, reluctant first, state(PA) 25% capacity mandate restaurants. actually better experience pre-COVID aside things menu unavailable due supply chain issues. probably make habit it, PA going 50% capacity soon, I'll point. anti maskers quiet today Well US American works Edelweiß Lodge, hotel owned US armed forces. tourist, recently go holiday Greece. anti american. facts.

Edit. article Bild. personally trust Bild factually correct. 
[Link BR.de cases downward trend least month now. would say supports point area peaks don’t need restrictions keep cases check. Georgia actually excellent example. People I'm scream sheeple say live fear. kinda scary sports people go tiny white bus go meets. Link appears broken, interested. repost?  know Sandy Hook especially disgusting people harassing victims families calling fake shit.

People crazy. density cities expected worse outbreak. HK happened people knew do. Everyone masking up. reading sites early Jan. made mention masks. like SARS Asia like nah... BS masking problem never locked down, like pulling teeth get people care every step way could care less getting side. Idiots idiots be. country that’s messed up. Good luck buddy Germany praising Merkel virologist Christian Drosten. almost 6,000 people dead Sweden lockdown. Norway Finland lockdown lost less 350 people. Canadian mask-wearing rates much lower American mask-wearing, search Google Apple’s mobility data, collected two different methods, see American lockdown almost identical terms timeliness, depth, duration. bit deeper US actually. Lmao. even study. commentary. fucking joke. But, watch hysterical subreddit eat like true..

Masks seem completely irrelevant big scheme things. compare counties countries according timing extent mask mandates, looks like masks near zero effect transmission rates. WrOnG! mAsKs mAde DeStRoY uS! 






(Karens, 2020) implying lockdown possible response. Whether worth debated later, let's conflate damage virus damage lockdown. 
Just look Sweden. lot people die there? Yes. decided lockdowns worse destroys economy amongst things. Let's see happens 6 months now. worked hotel summer one staff wore mask.  Among reasons work anymore. hoax claimers/anti-maskers bad anti-vaxxers. humanity learned previous pandemics? Thank time, I'll going now. Lol, word “Fauchi” spelled Fauci. Could before? here's thing. *could* returned normal now, selfishness noncompliance, can't, case death counts still high. Surging, fact, many places. recommend search Google Apple’s mobility data. see US’s lockdown quite par course terms timeliness, depth, duration. Almost identical Canada’s example. bit deeper longer People struggle grasp change, there's anything grasp onto tells everything normal fine, they'll grab onto like life vest Titanic. ""COVID fake"" everything normal fine change thing lives, buy that, everyone anything COVID part conspiracy. impacting testicals causing swelling. Germany n skorea controlled virus without destroying economy. called good leaders taken science based approach. U dont completely lock success. Whats acceptable 1000 plus dead September. PCR tests presence genetic material. 

PCR Establish Infection. Angry Anderson lol get wanting go back normal would really rather die wait 1 year? UK someone get COVID, recover, die three months later unrelated condition. 
They still counted COVID death. Hmmmm. 
 
?????????????????????????? 
 
It's counted COVID death within 28 days positive COVID test UK. 
Edit:
If want 'source', visit pretty much official publication UK Government regarding COVID deaths.  I'm christian believe ""I wear mask"" bullshit something Jesus would flip tables over.  Masks made situation Spain exponentially worse. beat first wave without then, things control, governments mandated everywhere ""reminder we're pandemic"" see cases begin skyrocket couple weeks later. wondering, 99% people wear streets. 

It's clear data science using masks simple solution complex problem makes pandemic worse, better. I’m thankful scientists. think scientific process honestly IMPORTANT human invention next nothing. It’s elevated us simple land dwelling apes modern humans it’s shield us superstitious conspiracy theorist nutjob. 

I fucking love logical people. Without would honestly feel alone world. I’m glad relatively good amount positions power. current anti-intellectualist movement, number logical people power going down. Key paragraph:

This sick argument. people literally wanting others die mass scale go Applebees without wearing mask. Mandates, every state recommendations wear masks people do: seasons past, noone wore them. Australia actually really low flu season year, likely masks social distancing.

Georgia pretty control cases months. wouldnt necessarily cite success. Yaakov Litzman, served health minister initial outbreak virus ... heads influential ultra-Orthodox faction coalition government, expressed particular ire toward restrictions limit observant Jews attending communal prayers synagogues upcoming Infection rates ultra-Orthodox communities among highest country. What’s date courthouse news article? I’m seeing one come mobile (but massive pet peeve mine organisations including date original publication - happens often you’d think - need know case unleash rage). 

Are telling Trump right said wildfires fault sweeping forest floors? No. smallpox. confusing variolation vaccination. Variolation contriversial could get smallpox could die. Masks cure now. wear mask never get sick. Trust me! Um: chance agree shut party pandemic-compliance official came door. Instead “hostile”, prompted calling police support.

I expected would teen home whose parents would paying fine no, 19yo student housing, everyone plenty warning consequences.

The article makes quite plain chose make example him. don’t disagree. agree horrible reporting, gone ways last days. Earlier week reporting lowest numbers, obviously result lag due holiday weekend. There's question trends moving right direction, least US. Unfortunate avoidable. Whenever go see anyone behaving differently, wearing masks shops. see anyone socially distancing all.

I want hurry get back office like normal fear second wave soon upon us. gonna lie, felt weird masking first reason.

This strong leadership top needed. culture change would easier. least I'm NJ, messaging solid. already put money pandemic started unfortunately one couples stuck shitty situation. crystal ball predict would pandemic November 2019 signed contracts wrote checks I’m tired people acting like people don’t want isolate indefinite amount time think it’s hoax we’re kind deliberate, malicious, murderous rage want get sick get others sick. Fuck you. one around look back bioshpere collapses lol Water wet stopped variolation 1700s, dad old. likely young gotten smallpox vaccine, would scar had. Tell getting new vet, too. mean could?? I’m St. Louis see time. that, indoor dining open see packed restaurants one wearing mask besides server scar smallpox vaccine, variolation. stopped variolation Jenner invented vaccine. Trump say feels vaccine makers dragging heels, may may true. say favor releasing ""untested stuff"". remotely close. Horse. Crap. FlU, bRo! Yikes sorry that. She’s anti vax vaccinated you? Yea, that's exactly feels like. Like can't handle negative emotions all, reminds grandfather demands smile talk him. Can't really that, feels fake fuck, that's big reason can't get along. like I'm surrounded fragile people. key word looking variolation. carry significant risk death. found meteor crater, inside crown jewels England, think - ""well, kind thing falls space time"". mean proof aliens government satellite put there. But... LOL! Plenty states opened restrictions. 34 states mask mandates all. Sweden never locked anything first place. places fine. plenty evidence don’t need draconian measures place order keep cases check. sent home? kids school converted office ""waiting sent home room"", drop mask go wait parents get you. party, definitely shut first chance. people won’t learn history, even though happened several months ago. Yeah area group great didn’t meet crazy homeschoolers stereotype luckily. confirm. Many family members conspiracy theorists behave like Covid isn’t real. Yeah, said ""I trust her"".

You're obsessed theory untrue. There's lot evidence could lab leak. best, say know, also means know came animals organically.

There's thou-doth-protest-too-much arguments. like Daszak. EcoHealth Alliance to? Law clearly states fine amount, might 19, he's still adult. feel bad anyone making pandemic worse. Truth. course, I'm talking moderation ... much good thing that. I'm sure agree getting headaches whenever stop drinking coffee ideal situation, think?

Thanks, great day hope stay safe healthy! likely depends upon many factors give single answer. guy calling shots hhs took cdc numbers one point.

HR may care personnel aren’t upholding standards endangering larger company. 

But course go media, could traced back you. Dr Fauchi world wide reputation point. word ""renowned"" spelt /s. could choose ones, bad. symptoms? students say it’ll November 3, Dems give lie Trump re-elected. believe COVID worldwide conspiracy discredit president, anybody who’s died, died something else. students said, let’s give everyone, let natural selection take get it, get it. know they’re parroting parents saying home. Here's agree. hope masks stay around. Please wear one cold flu. Thanks I'm extremely irate tripling down, FedEx 62,000 planes load BS. 

This locked misinformation. filthy piece cloth going anything 'researchers' claim. Market facial recognition blocker. Make billions. That's cool mate, Bosnia Herzegovina 20-25%, lol No? Teachers coming house would still part govt education. homeschooled. groups homeschoolers etc. Imagine posting response reading understanding article. fucking retarded. infection rate climbing exponentially. gets catastrophic quickly. earlier lockdown less time needed get rate down. Yes times army monkeys available tests on. keep cages, groups similar species. distribute across country high population areas getting lions share. could also build viewing area scientists general population could observe them. could charge admission. put animals display also could attract school busses full children our,.. our.. would call monkey storage facility? Oh. zoo. test monkeys zoo. Yesterday’s article headline said three countries voting US, Iraq, Libya. given new surgical mask every day late march. must state specific. N95s were/are shit show. Tennessee yeah see people without masks** time!** Even still mandated see people, almost always men, refusing comply. lifted even though many store chains posted wear one I'm often minority wearing one go places. 

Here family rural Illinois state law company policies Walmart like simply ignored. retired mom took part time job credit union finally listened take leave job coworkers wearing masks work, travelling parties. Even germ-a-phobe one. Things would different Trump started touting mask-wearing patriotic back February early March. supporters would followed without complaining rights would mostly summer probably. Problem still people buying nonsense. believe everything hear yet disbelieve everything see two eyes. Shut dam tv. Go look around! never never reasons given thinks distancing important masks last resort can't distance.

Problem insignificant percentage people province simply distancing. Results study came out: 

Outcomes Associated Use Kinin B2 Receptor Antagonist Among Patients link 48th population, 18th cases per mill, must also something wrong. viral load theory makes sense. Look many younger health care workers got sick. Jesus christ inhumane fuck, people still people, hell could innocent  tough escape. girls boys night out. spouse social network. married person understand this. Italy definitely good example competent anything even claim false, per capita death numbers proportion. America around 4 times cases (2% vs 0.5% italy) 1.5 much death rate. Edit - pointed italy slightly higher death rate US. looking worst country Europe 

Bullshit effect would same. claim president encouraging cult ignore doctors instructions makes difference?

Clinton rapid action pandemic team place. would ignore things general would move fast contain. lied ignored way back February 

America leading long time example tackle things. absolutely rhyme reaosn America cases deaths even third world countries 

Your post perfect example complete ignorance. trump leader. takes lot population completely ignorant even get here. Unless people brain washed thinking competent leaders matter, else play sideism? president totally mtter, country cannot led, whatever wants. let's elect buffoon entertain us instead competent person decades experience levels governing 

imagine claiming straight face tht America worst world even worse absolute third world country something prevented. admit america even worse third world countries? appreciate service work pooping factually wrong. Please go read scientific papers even basic news virus spout nonsense like bullshit.  people think going centralized quarantine centers inhumane

Some say willfully allowing 200,000 die preventable death zero national mourning inhumane,

Different cultures... significant undercount. Officials estimate least 80 undetected cases India confirmed can't argue there. that's word vaccine comes (vacca cow Latin). Imunity? Really? believe can.

Here England, social distancing virus control believe Western countries. Social distancing absolutely vital control this.

Test trace sounds good theory, practice good large part, obvious flaws relies 100% people compliant aren't; trying trace everyone person contact people person contact fighting losing battle. Also, masks remain source contention parts world regarding effectiveness give people false sense security leads forget social distancing.

Whatever merits masks, substitute social distancing: social distancing virus control social distancing trick again. tried tested terms solving problem root, preventing transmission. Can't 2nd wave first never ends. cares death rate  lot easier make masks make TP though. Lots people stopped looking work since there's fuck right now.  Though much much bigger issue fact September cheap name brand N95 masks still available major US retailers. truly believe masks required guests- unless they’re eating drinking. 

If want service thus server 2metres away, put mask on. Simple that. confirm. work restaurant inside hotel. straight tell inlaws welcome house holidays. planning get airplane fly spiking midwestern state. 

I get sick shit, get wanting see grandkid, there's way I'm blowing (hopefully) 11th hour like that. thought fires good force everyone stay inside wear masks? see '/s' feel heart it. Masks never worn universally evidence effectiveness human settings weak. drug say much stop transmission/illness near impossible argue - studies exist masks. (And cloth masks indicate effective respiratory illnesses hospital settings.) super-star post 9/11? better trust experience. entirely true. Cats coronavirus young spontaneously mutate years later Feline Infectious Peritonitis fatal. idea happens. aren’t infectious happens, it’s catastrophic long term effect. guessing, saying?

So whole point vaguely related issue?
Well there's question happened someone else vaguely related issue clearly right, police enforce laws situation! federal state governments helping more. agree shitty situation business owners.

By going indoors increasing risk dramatically.

Stay safe. Close eyes, put fingers ears say ""la la la la la la"" world around exist. People recover home, usually get ""after Covid"" examination. get another test most. 

Time tell. cases, wise side caution. words, vast majority excess global deaths 2020 due hysterical over-reaction pandemic. I'm server. People horrible right now. freak wear masks, wait disinfect tables, limited seating due Covid regulations, whatever reason-having make reservations end world. I've back work couple months I'm already burnt out. brutal. Huh?

You mean white folks die less US? Access health care often choices access.

Everything comes money.  Numbers high - suspicion over-hyping harm president

Numbers low - accusations down-laying

It's impossible make everyone happy. Yea, 10 days work virus absolutely brutal compared month closed getting money. used watch conspiracy theory videos entertainment like watching twilight zone, lots creepy if’s! It’s sad using deadly virus know nothing using brainwash followers. people believe Youtuber lives moms basement scientific facts history repeating crazy! Yeah feel guys....I always thought us Canada similar pandemic really showed us lucky are. 30% Myalgic Encephalomylitis patients (another post viral syndrome) would like word you. Ah yes, situation dangerous public health lockdown required isn’t stressful all. /s

People minimize invalidate stress others narcissistic assholes. denial coping mechanism combined emotional repression working you, doesn’t mean rest us numbed are. lack stress abnormal response, way around.  problem afford lockdown. covid19 pays attention want. Argue money, education &amp; politics covid19 want, interested. similar issue many look comes covid restrictions enforced, dont know else explain it. Many people raised point Im yet get sort sensible answer.


Given students went back recently, chances first offence. totally agree, see companies coming telling employees escalate issue people refuse. became clear people willing actually kill employees telling wear mask liability took strange turn. similar stores direct employees physically stop shop lifter. sucks doesnt seem fair company doesnt way safely enforce rule usually go option puts least fault. 

People suck. American virus crossed Atlantic? Coming place near soon. probably stupid, similarly lacking principles similarly focused government slogans claim Australia travel ban? seem well? curious epidemiologists could favor stay-at-home say also travel ban. make much sense...People leave homes international travel? Good points afraid counter-productive point. lot things risky...that doesnt mean sit home day. Last time checked people still drive cars, eat junk food, exercise, drink alcohol, drugs....the list endless. Exactly correlating isn’t always causation. I’m avoiding restaurants right now, it’s true people going frequently follow guidelines. F15 landed half wing I've duped... 🤔 dare try make life yourself! selfish.... ""Do smell burnt toast?""

-California good news - Pfizer's stock price investors. idea, saw better I’m supposed fly biz Wednesday  ""Silent"" Majority, nah, anti-science folks never shut Yeah, that's playing really well it!? I'm sure look health paying obesity /s Sympathy mean believe people deal consequences actions. Iceland ""next year vaccine"" ain't indefinitely Didn’t upton Sinclair write book this?

Too bad it’ll reaction. Sigh. 50 remember arguments made seat belts motorcycle helmets. come ask need anything, want someone middle eating stop, get mask put say ""no thank you""?  keep telling that, Cum Blaster. Denial poor coping mechanism though. really terrifying world makes be. about? one said Cummings break laws fined, one focusing that, people realise separate issue.

Ah, know person repeat offender? That's literally topic Reddit since Donald Trump elected president U.S. country gave disease. disease thats kept bed bound 2 years. Bankrupted medical bills. Im stuck here. I’ll probably die victim  Yeah dude like nobody batted eye that’s fucked thing say would rather send little shit prison need better things, really. Facebook twitter aren’t unique United States

Yeah, effectively weaponized here.

I also feeling Germans little better ""critical thinking"". really think Sweden fall winter. Even public health officials admit they're nowhere near herd immunity, they're expecting things worsen coming months. Aye. barely anyone game though yawn Interesting curve last month. know explains dip end Oh is. context, charge recoup losses visits people without insurance. Yeah ya reason Tylenol charged $50. large percentage uninsured use ER primary care. money lost. hospital charge insured large amounts account loss, hospital can’t pay bills closes. insured individuals aren’t paying much, they’re paying copay $100-200. insurance company takes rest. also insurance companies charge much. Hopefully y’all see need form universal coverage. People get angry thought paying someone else’s healthcare, don’t realize already are. supposed eat drink mask on? customers coming livelihood, job. Especially true bartenders. big issue Trump's messaging. LoL
But won’t know adverse side effects vaccines year. true, every Spain least. number kids classes reduced. live Madrid, 2 children one different school. classes reduced aprox. 22 kids.

What true risk high kids like mix kids. Estate sales. ;) Yes want coming state! German school classes decide wear mask not, 30 people together, much difference? usually run camps. people running aren’t teachers employed school, they’re employed individual place. stop weird refer ""a optimistic 50%"" Exactly would Anything keep Economy even it’s sacrificing million lives so!! waiting Karma train roll through... it’s coming hear distance! corona bang sing se March, country wanted first one lockdown. However, begun to, others shut too. 
I wonder domino effect... hope so. degree education, since decided pursue teaching. co-operating teacher student teaching one told straight still time consider another career. bad (I actually quite well), cared enough tell truth unforgiving job. real pity felt way, too, awesome teacher. 

That conversation reason chose teach, I'll never forget it. Taiwan pointed lockdown super strict fines contact tracing arrest quarantine- anyone potential covid 14 day quarantine. 

It worked - 5 deaths, 250k people quarantined—probably like 5k cases... 

Do think actually get done here??? real consistent strong leadership policy levels—basically impossible!! 

Population diverse, rebellious, divided!! exactly plain sight. Nazis kept meticulous records would know control public perception.

We similar media complex America thanks fairness doctrine repeal. Watch today's broadcasts panel discussions compare something 60's-70's.

In era tv discussions, today intellectual discourse much anything. op-ed media. easy alter public perception depth anything. You’re unemployed NEET lives home mum pretends 19 different people internet, get grip lmao I’m sorry I’m sorry made dine restaurant. don’t mind eating home family super anti-mask. It’s awful. smart teachers willing to. afraid ones see problem it. They're also teaching children.... surprise. people act surprised? Tech UT games yesterday in-person attendance.

It's gonna be...not great. Meat plants use refrigerated circulated air conditions operate... also stand pretty close together work. Also they're usually highly exploitable labor. Yup! I’ve saying beginning. won’t eating indoors over. order ahead pick up, wipe everything wash hands. even get anxious places couple minutes everyone eating. first all, kind teacher you’re describing probably doesn’t exist. Second all, even though tons teachers quitting, we’re also told expect mass layoffs coming years economy, demand probably won’t high think. 

If somewhere “hiking” teacher, I’m sure first go. Even small slow global grain production ripple effect hurts brink worst.
Pushes brink. Bringing new group food insecurity world. Nonsense, Dominic Cummings broke multiple laws. Youre utterly deluded think average bloke fined. 


It though, talking wall? clear statement made wouldnt carried Cummings dealt properly. point people stopped listening government. 


The maximum fine kept repeat offenders. consensus ones breaking rules thing circulating got it. I'm hermit goes office month live Arizona. Get new therapist. Like right now. report ass. completely unprofessional behavior. Excuse me, paid volunteered countless youth programs senior cents teach fitness mental health, looks like could use both! running got plenty elected office still understand. replied comment saying India expected lower IFR west due lower population. proof discussed far confirms this.

Why discussing India ""safe""? never even mentioned start arguing it?

Less deadly mean harmless unless illiterate... I'm recommending anything. I'm epidemiologist. take source claim?  think confusing terms *sick* *symptomatic*. Meh I'll let guys take rushed vaccines first. something goes wrong, hey, better ME. Makes sense Matrix chose it. general use, using start every comment.  Imagine throwing house party global pandemic crying fine, hey guess that's one way government reclaim furlough pay how!  peer reviewed vivo. isn’t academic report it’s editorialized news article. movie? Hey hope make mad enough quadruple 18k*3 would 54k 62k. Hi, wanted ask question Coronavirus I've seeing many views issue.

I saw video little earlier today person went build immunity exposed (adaptive immunity), went death rates countries, well season would impact, pretty much saying lockdowns way go handling situation. makes sense general understanding immunity going data. (I try best find video again)

But point current Coronavirus fact something that'd cause death, led complications body 100% recover (leading complications future)?

Have got wrong idea? Still interesting. Ontario would put estimate 14M people, roughly 140k (1%) exposed - around 3-4 times reported cases. Seems about...right? Yeah, may infections first time around. However, lockdowns simply appetite it. They'll probably close restaurants, bars, schools open though. hearing lot New York businesses like J.P. Morgan Chase want bring employees back office soon, fuel too. Luckily northeast handled extremely well preparing this. They've greatly expanded healthcare capacity preparation. Also, made great advances treatment too. problem was:

there enough masks do? advice masks people sto buying enough doctors

asian countries: masks production goes brrr

western countries: lets nothing TRUMP advocated taking guns without due process pass thr bumpstock ban.

Yet people still shit dems reason. forget india???  anyway. sold place. sister began sewing giving doctors nurses everyone else could. Creepy Twitter still active. Exactly. Murdering customer base bad business. telling someone something similar recently. least I’m working covid unit proper PPE take every precaution. I’ve exposures regular medical floors covid unit. protest something proven effective? thought Canada reported zero deathd finally backwards move? 

Whatever... welcome! original phrase ""weißer Fleck"", translates literally white stain- imagine, instance, stain get rub fat white shirt. footnotes, noted refers subtle yet important imperfection problem. far know nothing race all. I’ve ate once, patio. Honestly, felt guilty that. many friends sort seem take seriously, go eat go bars semi-regularly. want us come hangout feels bad saying “no” trying guilt ask. brain That’s unfortunate religiously opposed possibility came lab. 

I literally write ""YES POSSIBLE"", answer ""WHY THINK IMPOSSIBLE!""

I write several times possible, also means nothing possible.

You're irrational religious way now. 

I tell matters theory ""possible."" 

You cannot counter arguments, know well someone tells ""hey possible monkey hiding bedroom!"" care sheer random possibility it, thing ""yeah whatever, reason think monkey escaped zoo climbed window, ignore possibility, reason think actually case.""

But block psychologically, WANT believe virus man made. 

It feels better you, cause discomfort think happened reason that's world is.

Forget possibilities. Everything possible.

Look proven instead. would waste time stupid ideas totally unproven. Oh they’ve already indicated SMEs paying (although one would expect taxes rise across board). 
I’m one moan constantly big companies paying little honestly, legal pay less taxes don’t think many would turn opportunity.
I think whole taxation system needs simplification opportunities loopholes avoidance (legal) schemes minimised, kind change, like many, ability oversee small minorities end much much worse off. There’s solution fix make everyone happy, I’m one losers moment. sub full propaganda.

Wait. telling Vitamin supplementation miracle cure covid reduces chance ICU admission 97%? I'm completely shocked tell you. don’t say bad leadership. lmao lock first time  it.... along. Nothing shitty lying politicians stupid freedom loving people unwilling follow advice, nothing people going have. situation WHO.... probably Chinese also s/ Dont reject obvious. work dammit. first thought well. Ehh, I'll accept anything absolute truth agrees me.

I'd put /s there, victims confirmation bias. got real douchebags comments here. understand fantasy wish could like too, even it’s realistic. ignore fact America far away leads world deaths pandemic we're 4% world population makes idiotic response irrelevant. Trump dragged white house handcuffs ought scare fuck deplorables, nooooooo Btw already got one co-workers fired wearing maak guess bad feel? Lmao

Yeah, modern hero. 

Even say virus fake. Unless work healthcare opinion direct impact work performance, nothing work. actually yes, case snitching like opinion trying hurt them. thats pathethic, petty low always stock good supply things like anyway, guess sort prepping that. never shopping carts full. good authority least one guy town filled basement selling tidy profit. Next time get glasses independent shop. LensCrafters ripoff. pay half that. Money issue. telling us safe travel China travel bans place back March. lost confidence them. Game over, then. dont know yet novel effects needs studied.

Scary times...

Hopefully though thought baby boom

No, there's already baby bust. right mind would want kids historic recession? Yeah dude, opinion someone well trained field basing opinion evidence solid line logic equivalent random jag like spouting bullshit nothing back up. Now, information evidence actually dispute opinion? I've wondering exactly now. Glad I'm right.  Here’s related discussion posted yesterday Covid-19 agree. said, idea reinfection seems scare people - think partially b/c says potential efficacy vaccines.. shit morons, don’t need hind sight bias tell us  Report him. masks pockets carbon filter inserts help air quality there? picked 2 pack 50 inserts much amazon back combat allergy season along covid read facebook comments week ago. Dude going shit fake serious nobody actually died it, end post says wife 2 kids fuckin COVID, believe them. can't understand people like all. work breakfast. 6am-2pm. capacity limits, run hour+ wait daily. allowed dine-in, will. 

When full, stay back tables. uncomfortable one masked seated, so... end human species. 


Like yeah, maybe today corona virus kills 2% infected maims large amount people 35 health condition, effectively killed lot world population disability, economics, actual annual mortality chances increasing age + long term damage critical organs compounded previous damage organs last bout.  


The hope humanity would case leper colony uninfected, ultimately massive amount infected people would come resent try infect that's humanity does. going strictly ""what chances dying covid testing positive us?"" 2.35%.

If we're asking ""what true infection fatality rate people infected covid?"" really hard say know many people never got test. 2.35% people get tested die it, 1% seems like fair estimate. Sound decision 👍 time I'll happy read this...it's shame destiny turned into, d1 good false positivity load crap. 

""The Titanic sinking!""  


""Nonsense, ice!"" think understand, biggest problem can’t agree reality, tackle problem together don’t? problems made worse tackle fact
 don’t agree reality. (I’m honestly sure solve it, never solved entirely.)  Vaccines hope then, Canada — well, keeping us Yanks 👍 got expert here. wear masks Sweden still got lower deaths USA. think easy wear mask everyone fine. “There 1 Impostor among us”  Spain, France UK literally shut three months. cases increasing rapidly. suggesting worked elsewhere. 

Also shutdowns caused majority economic damage, understand long lockdown would help. Spoiler alert: can

Welcome communism. society, never cared teachers. make generalized statement based 38 years experience classroom. pandemic brought attitude full view. Teachers expected risk lives students. happen die, ""Oh well."" mystery teacher shortage. right mind would aspire become teacher climate? consequences uncaring attitude toward teaching profession education general played generations come. Monday morning quarterbacking always seems work know. real issue govt gridlock lack consistent help policy. don’t blame lockdown...what lockdown caused 1m deaths...thats moronic. 

If gov’t consistent - states fed acting peoples interests consistently—not ppp bull put money hands enough get thru maybe things wouldnt desperate. We’ll vaccine pirate lackeys steal it. Thanks this. It’s interesting. don’t know German phrase “white stain” sort idiom requires explanation. American assume something “white man’s burden” something else race racism. Perhaps “invisible” better word “white”? 

I’ve lot conversations Germans used literal English translations phrases like ask meant.

I know Chinese there’s million problems like example way generally say “so-so” 马马虎虎 meaning “horse horse tiger tiger” doesn’t make less sense “so-so” cannot translated literally. big countries never go along it.

It's ironic westerners trying demolish postwar global institutions countries steep decline need convenient scapegoats. Ugh know one whose uncle died it... still don’t believe it!!!! 60 mind old (this person 47). still think everything overblown think it’s ridiculous wear mask  oo authoritarian, he's idiot needed punishing. loves party 19, still wouldve realised dumb sounds like real catch. make sure bare minimum lazy ass ordered pay child support, that's LEAST could do. region do, make effort involves planning week different places different items make multiple stops. totally doable convenient convenient store.


An Italian shop go gives money return mason jar pesto, sauces, antipasto etc. cheaper refill olive oil / vinegrette jars buy new ones.


There's soap place go soaps, sanitizer, detergent etc, refill idea.


The brewery road takes back bottles refill growler jug.


I totally realize efforts make near zero difference figure I'm supporting business idea anything else know one elderly person severe asthma really wants go eat. keep explaining air flow etc them. get it. started go out, say they're locked down. Amazon, Newegg, ebay, etc sellersare charging much n95s. find kn95s fda list less $4 each, even cheap apparently fake ones still $20 5. hope true, feels like propaganda. Aside wanting support businesses, idea anyone would want dine indoors restaurant. What’s pull? LOL, guy article even talked harassed. interviews people MI Trump rally couple days ago ham man said, *Covid hoax created destroy America*. exact dumb mythology pushed Sandy Hook , *It's false ~~flag~~ flu operation!* conclusion wear mask go party /s would reddit allow sub? Seems f*d Infection rates low, someone old still avoid spending time indoors others Canada.

I would call American infection rates ""low"", parents quite comfortable visitors.

In short, matter much USA, Florida particular needs tourists dollars, large numbers Canadians coming year. Get used idea. dunno. Look south walton. Never outbreak. Really all. wide open since week memorial. miracle maybe, we've times never worry. Maybe Orlando Miami areas different.  Walton mostly weekly rental houses maybe basically non existent there. saying Trojan horse Vaccine kill virus + Vaccine harm human = good aren’t entitled care free years, anything else really. part prevent spread coronavirus communities. think like type like idiot? Germany always pretty clear keep running things like normal medical sector.

During COVID went dentist, ENT, neurologist, MRI, ophthalmologist GP several times (also 350€ covered insurance). 

I mean, need new hip joint, need now, COVID over. COVID always assessed lesser risk compared diseases need treated. I'm glad handled way. essential system needs running accesible everyone. Simply stay home high risk. 

If regularly mixing people vulnerable, stay home well. 

If not, get back work.

What’s issue here, exactly? Spoiler alert: that's ensure daily deaths get hand. thought we'd learned there's around 3-week delay actions results due lag infection serious complications/death, are. start up, especially container re-use would trivial. lot places stopped using consumer-owned containers due Covid. another bs Fox News headline meant portray Fauci enemy people. anyone made anti-mask sub yet? lack central point story. guy told police close party refused. point got fined. hope Canadian government changes policies anyone leaves non-essential travel hard time getting insured. county already sacrificed enough seem give damn. USUALLY. know means, right ? cheese Media groundwork already way, return national lockdown announced, public blame, rather criminal incompetent administration. I'm sorry loss. bit late keep deaths minimum. Oh please, expecting expect (legal) adult face adult consequences 26 would utterly absurd. matter whether brains \*fully\* developed, whether developed point able understand responsibility, 18 are. fact, significantly younger 18 are.

But know. America good. Communism bad. Let bad. Right good. Fuck middle ground right?

Because that's America seems like click global also don’t like releasing anything year. guess, you’ll see $100 million-plus budgeted films held back theatres operate least 75% occupancy. then, we’ll likely get lower-mid budget films. could actually good time smaller distributor really get foothold market.

Completely agree. spite bullshit thankful job plus overtime every week. feel millions truly unemployed. heart goes ya Thank you, importantly, populist prime minister would eaten alive anything like so... nah. least another month election. Yeah, almost like healthcare system based fraud unnecessary procedures ideal pandemic. sign new lease property not, month-to-month contract expires allowed stay long want stay. previous lease, on, becomes null. new lease, on, takes over. would essentially guest point, could tell leave without going eviction time. 

The complication would refuses move shit, become responsible moving shit new lease expires. 100%. downvoted, trolled, harassed day. don’t think comments unreasonable.

You’re child. Thank you! sure hell hope ""delay""....most fatal cases snowbirds. sacrificed economy, lost jobs (or work home) grandchildren going school online (or person masks) them. damn well better stay home.  repertory theaters packed before. sure hell packed fucking pandemic oh. asked someone define evil necessary. so, gave another example someone needing die someone else insane (opposite justifying evil), especially use labels put people certain categories ""us vs. them"". could humans vs monkey, certain groups humans vs. groups humans, something agree with. i'm also pro-BLM, probably pisses lol That's cool get coming little mistake poor judgement lack life experiences. police told shut receive fine decided ignore them. deserves book thrown him. remind now? Looks like wait much days. great all, COVID likely around least another year point restaurant /schools/offices ect open back up. thought originally idea “flatten curve” completely shut society years shame one leaves houses. I’m sure get downvoted I’m hard time putting words feel COVID. Additionally live Oregon air terrible leaving state go Utah week. wear masks everywhere, choice toddler breathing smoke possibly getting evacuated last minute home, vs risk contracting COVID, I’ll take risk. Probably Moscow. Thank you! answer question.  Happens I'd like admit.  Thank you! Sorry loss. Ooo, looking see there’s case study research masked people getting it. found rare cases all? Lmao. Listen man finally wake realize mainstream media lying feel real dumb when's last time seen positive Covid headline CNN gods sake even recoveries side screen 😂 know I'm safe get virus go outside spread fine. actually sad media done us humans sub bunch scary ass people take risks fun locked house Nov 2021 according Fauci😂 going put firefighters risk. Anyone living areas smoke air increased risk.

Ideally, avoid chance exposure SARS-COV-2! 

Some worst-affected areas covid-19 (especially terms deaths) high levels air pollution - particular NO2.

The Po Valley northern Italy, Madrid, London, Paris, Belgium, south Netherlands, north-east france, north-west Germany - areas had/have highest NO2 levels whaddyaknow suffered badly back spring. disagree problem things spike like crazy, numbers trend upward quicker rates way disease works stats see today results decisions made weeks earlier. America's attention span built handle sort hindsight. mean changing vets mind? like astronaut change mind thinking world flat. nobody going make movies fill theaters over. redcaps alone pay rent make films. Alas, optimistic. expect return full lockdown end month. thanks That’s true. USA still #1 world many 5yr/10yr/etc cancer survival rates. 
Many can’t afford medications true. prioritize health people weapons war. 
But often get centrist liberal issues element personal responsibility. far left erased elements PR truly believe throwing money govt solution everything. 

A MASSIVE proportion meds health issues diseases affluence. wanna smoke? wanna booze hard? morbidly obese? plain obese one year?....YOU pay MORE. Can’t afford to? work program ready volunteer type stuff. 

There’s always “it’s expensive eat healthy” “don’t know better”...bullshit. 

We also tax regulate McDonald’s crap food? want amount govt control? NO. taxes paying everyone’s healthcare. generational poverty section 8 who’s obese 5 kids...they need step up. 

Now, “the greatest lie” rich tricking middle class thinking poor source problems. That’s true extent. But, massive poverty problem that’s growing. need solutions involve teach man fish edited comment, let clarify. month month lease. landlord wants sign 1 year lease (he increased rent), sign leaves. would end month month rental agreement sign new lease still living apartment. Also ex lived 3 years, definitely LIVES moves out. Lol, one listens. First flatten curve, vaccine, it’s year vaccine. it. fact tiny minority among hundreds well wishes negate fact said it, making feel like supposed mention all. Okay maybe detailed comment little better, assumed people would realize negative comment among good comments. future assume make small differences clearer.  ????whattt wayy Maybe. many tissues express ACE2, may find way hide reservoir. several viruses lay dormant central nervous system example. would get small doses without mask, resulting immune response. don’t see difference article suggesting developing community-wide herd immunity exposure. either case, people co-morbidities elderly would still need take precautions. However, article indicates masks effective preventing getting virus, slightly helps prevent spreading virus. live there, outbreak mainly concentrated downtown madison. that's stupid, complicated, bring enough money disagree. boomers going parties social functions, too. fewer camera phones media.  could see that, live rural south near kinda big city masks aren’t really common anywhere. Maybe handing advice even think covid real serious. Wow guy rough. end, right. really cannot depend government, friends anyone else.  get downvoted 101 two cats, doesn’t mean make judgements whole veterinary profession operate. vets I’ve visited, maybe. anecdotes. 

Again, you’re ignoring comment schools opening spreading disease people, including children themselves. isn’t teachers afraid themselves. I’m particularly concerned getting sick would really rather go back, acknowledge schools aren’t safe open right now. 

I hate teaching online. It’s way work teaching person. Waaaayyyy more. take pay cut happen teaching pandemic? isn’t fault schools aren’t safe measures make safe taken. deal mouth breathers clue they’re talking spewing nonsense time. 

Also, think standardized tests actually measure anything meaningful, you’re even ignorant thought. feel bad kids you’re keeping fingers crossed standardized tests.

I kid who’s showing class, assignments. parents respond almost communication, don’t hold accountable. everything him. gets WAY attention kids I’m trying get work. already well grade level behavior even class. pay based performance standardized tests he’ll put zero effort into? 🙄 survey found people broke lockdown rules straight CummingsGate happened. completely irrelevant stretch, clear government behave somewhat correlates people do. WA, Australia, several weeks, worked well keeping cases right minimum. we're currently stage frankly optional outside hospital setting whether choose wear mask. We're still practicing level social distancing time. around healthy people pre-existing history, mask. I'm working around anyone complicating issues get C-19 (so asthma, elderly, chemotherapy, diabetes, etc) mask sake.  still well Michigan 🤞🏻 Yeah that’s terrible grand scheme things isn’t norm isn’t reason panic. Also, we’ve six months. cannot call anything long term. So. 

He wait till Monday enforce seriously important, life saving rule six, party illegal ready find. knew going happen, wanted give days could use pubs, clubs social gathering another excuse failing every possible hurdle.

Well done. economy weird. know lots people losing jobs, white collar jobs, one largest universities announced huge pay cuts anyone making $50,000. However, area, housing freaking booming. Houses flying market 1-2 days offers asking. Despite restaurants still supposed 50% capacity, every parking lot packed full hours. live small state middling economy begin with. I’ve never seen disparate time. stop anit-mask numbers growing everyday YES!

A respirator would great case. Normal masks ""I'm gonna protect others wearer"" (Surgical masks less). 

Respirator (N95/KN95/KF94 up) ""Fuck them, I'm gonna say mothafucka life, even rest dies"". attempt take death rate reach economic conclusions

Bottom line there's effective treatment cure vaccine people refuse mitigate expect bad economy

If people suddenly randomly die expect bad economy, examples (illness, accidents, drugs) either mitigated avoided completely treated fact

Sweden bad example bet lots factors socially distanced default. Scandinavian countries decided pull Sweden would also Sweden, bizarrely became poster-child free-market/anti-lockdown crew, suffered 577 deaths per million yet GDP fell 7.7%, worse neighbours Norway (down 5.3%), Finland (down 6.3%) much Denmark’s 7.8% yet three nations much fewer deaths – Denmark worst 107 per million. Nope. SC. LOL, plastics! Now, could figure way covert plastics test subjects ... 

.. wait: plastics petroleum product, 😣 agree must fear. lot people deal scary difficult things acting like ostrich: bury head ground pretend nothing happening can't deal it. Apart idiots truly believe nothing going on, people know deep virus real dangerous simply emotional tools deal fear anxiety causes admit that, downplay even facts right front them.

Edit: head, hand  ideal world fined unfortunately live corrupt world. doesn’t mean hostile 19 year old shouldn’t get away it.

If don’t make example someone everyone it. Cummings governments mistake (among others). fining teenager would yet another mistake. exactly. Although notice STILL ramped N95 production (go ahead try buy one somewhere, sometimes possible easy find all). ""free market handle everything, government bad"" nonsensical thinking. Well fuck. I've fence quitting nervous. Lol dont understand get downvoted true, clear statement. Source? publication coronavirus data within 28 days positive test There's concept called viral load. *Where* virus replicates body seems important regard severity disease, viral load may still high, even higher. Asymptomatic cases tend stay within nose create lots virus.

It's one puzzles spread seems happen mostly within households. theory people go get inoculation-level case end asymptomatic case. go home take mask off. virus replicating like crazy nose. family members lucky. thought fever pretty common covid symptom. also read less people come work/the gym/wherever they're feeling well know temp checked. trying say windshield absorbs roughly 94-98% UV rays, so... [like Google Bedtime feeding smart well. Helps conk night. many idiots. call rest sheeps.. means 50% chance one other. Either successfully immunized not. successfully immunized gotten sick. will. exactly said. 50% chance immunized not.

I never made claims sick would get. old t-shirt?
A stapler scissors?
Some rubber bands?

Boom. got ghetto mask - one actually better job lot see people wearing, like bandanas never said argue her. make point. let anti-mask idiots feel satisfied they're right. Yes...these right-wingers America Mentally Ill make alot money spewing bullshit!!! See also"" Evangelical Pastors!!!! mask rules state. lot people ignoring them. totally agree many people dying. even dumber that. ""Asians wear masks Asians sort China communist: therefore masks=communism MCCARTHYISM ACTIVATED resident - think northeast beginning stages, numbers gradually creeping starting gain momentum asymptomatic spread, yet gotten point anyone's going notice anything. think we've got another 4-6 weeks anyone even says, ""Hey, maybe ought look Northeast, numbers going up."" We're Rural America month ago, turn first. started slowly brewing major Southern population centers surge, that's going come head do, think. Former healthcare worker here. Winter tends bad hospitals. tend get full following reasons: 

-only half America gets flu shot. hospitals fill children, teens, people lung problems, elderly get flu get complications flu 

-people driving dangerously rain snow means car accidents hospitalizations accidents 

-more drunk driving accidents holiday parties 

-increase suicides holiday season 

-people getting really sick colds turned pneumonia 

-weather related injuries: slip falls due snow, rain, ice, etc. 

Hospitals already pretty full October March. without covid 19. Smoke pot too, helps prevent got it. Lol

Good one.   Idiots telling myth...LOTS idiots there. Idiots wear masks NEJM(New England Journal Medicine) published educated theory MASKS VACCINE. limit small exposures body turns immune response. gave example Revolutionary War, Washington(a future SMART President), ordered ,to combat smallpox, pin would put smallpox sore stuck soldiers- small dose smallpox would makes troops IMMUNE ravages smallpox! Yep. promise every hotel bare minimum get away spend extra money/do extra stuff, bare minimum standard differs bit quality hotel. hotel top high brand, budget brand either, middle. pro mask here, account PPE adorned healthcare workers died first wave? Extremes bad sides.

On one hand virus real exactly mild cold.

On hand fucking airborne Ebola death incarnated.

&amp;#x200B;

So one side believes anyone doesnt follow conspiracy theories mindless sheeps.

Other side believes everyone doesnt follow strict guidelines indefinite lockdowns facemasks virus spreading terrorists.

&amp;#x200B;

Absolutely fucking perfect people sitting middle, like do. Understood. like Florida. Completely irrelevant though, person knowingly put lives danger stop immediately, deserves fine. 🤔😃💩💦👅 medical condition exempts wearing mask. What? dare ask private medical history.  would vote that.   Succinct guys perfectly good senate, could using instead... yet business leaders petitioning Deblasio ""do something"" cause city flight, crime, etc. 

I'm saying city number issues right now, happened many banks businesses signed petition spent profits stock buybacks. never gave shit crumbling infrastructure. care happened homeless soaring, control rents propped failing work-in-office model broadband around long enough could seen work home coming gotten front it.

Even they're petitioning mayor governor whose hands tied lack funding. Notice they're petitioning ""do something""...

The rest country ""did something"" - reopened urging business leaders federal government wound causing wave virus infections dwarfed northeast dealt March May. Promoting theory would get half population face mask pronto. Skip pick truck, wear face mask! Easily 1/3 - 1/2 U.S. health condition would fall Pre-Existing conditions. thats looking 30,000+. Covid19 deaths 45 65 years old.


There's really reason single morbidly obese teachers. fits people's narrative. seems find pre-existing condition one death, blame that, move new death possible new pre-existing condition, blame that. forget making list Pre-Existing conditions nearly half Americans have. Albuquerque, it’s pretty good. see almost everyone wearing mask. problem is, see lot people wearing improperly. worse others. wearing face shield sans mask. majority, lot. 

I say people seemed forget 6 ft thing though. I’ve decided start say something them; especially wearing mask improperly. Though fair, find forgetting deserve called well older people know fairly well. One mechanic go 74 engine stand right now. Rebuilding one cars. One older person know keeps bitching ""the fucking protestors"" ""they whatever want, too"".  stare phone piss send anti BLM texts. dont time energy hate much. keep wanting go restaurants. dont feel comfortable that.  US fucked long long time. Get used living like years one dóes see [effective dropped quickly intelligent lockdown effected, suggesting measures taken clearly effect spreadibility Covid. kickstarted unseen rise cases already though, hospitalisations IC admittances month later. R stayed really low long time, witch cases low, untill allowed again, combination people giving parties,BBQs, weddings etc. distance wearing masks. specifically advised gather 6 people home again, although contact sports still allowed (which worries me). Let's hope helps R go again, although long plateaus around 1 might still stay plateau new cases Please get wrong. illustrating attention nuance wording give rise change meaning. hoping would clarify something that's conjectured hopefully wind potentially positive news.

My family pro-mask. least half dozen cloth masks ordered per family member months ago. kool-aid drinking puppets gullible you’re wishing death people, class act validity still saying recovered COVID immune? although Kansas democratic governor, legislature strongly republican gov faced much push back many efforts completely hampered. Midwest fastest-growing infection rate. Thank you, Mr. President. Active “china flu”. Yeah see dont support people online stuff brought Young, healthy people long-term impacts hearts brains, spewing sounds dangerous, opposite end spectrum...  person never said anything America jealous piece shit. country must suck much use America scapegoat constantly. Bring toy knives sometime nice American home. show real blade since country lets keep little pocket knives posts. 


Reddit based America too, place talk shit us Americans.  brave openly come tell world understand science, narrow minded way that. fairness mom that’s works every disease, making assumption would 100% work covid pretty dangerous.

I also assumption low exposure amounts potentially conferring immunity, knew CDC said wear masks LIKELY bunk, also know high probability definitive didn’t make risky decisions due assumption. Pretty sure lot families feel losing loved ones. Alternatively, could get snot covid patient, lightly cloud disinfectant weaken virus, rub nose?

In seriousness, headline misleading. expect people follow rules follow exactly? dealt CummingsGate particular properly maybe people would feel inclined trust government follow rules...

New report coming China proving face masks cure SUPER AIDS CANCER  rep rest world good. opposed full blown Qultist replying to? dealing global pandemic causing massive upheaval costs non-vaccination likely greater costs associated leaving large portions developing world unvaccinated.

I'd also interested reading issues distributing vaccines quick google search found WHO/UNICEF report Kenyan vaccination rates major vaccines (Measles, diphtheria, polio) numbers pretty solid. Mid high 90s depending estimate want yo use.  real vaccine masks made along way. Luckily TPTB, people follow politics think relevant them. played Apple 2(?) computer class grade school. died dysentery many times. NM  wear masks anywhere inside except private residences even outside cities (overkill opinion). really seen non-compliance. Wasn’t thought people low doses don’t develop proper immunity? What's cringey word ""whilst""?   was! 1978. vaccines 100% effective.

[Seasonal flu vaccine generally 40% 60% grandparents comment said links to, thry would roll vaccine low 50% effectiveness.

So lets imagine situation two grocery store employees right things whole time. get vaccinated even say wait recommended 3 weeks (or however long is), return full pre-covid socialization some. One two vaccine ineffective (using idealized statistics), create larger risk society vaccine's release.

Now, might something mitigate this. vaccine might prevent 50% infections reduce severity contagiousness another 30%. totally sure works. (And obviously depends actual vaccine) effectiveness may related demographics. 75+ like 30% effective 30-60 85% effective would make easier tell segment population play cool. You’re dramatic. Calm Delete Facebook account TODAY. never played black green origin trail u ain’t part generation.

My first visit 4 hours. KKK actually quite fond fabric face. looks Covid19 cardiovascular disease. See bradykinin theory. Congrats new job! imagine horror searching job time. 

When company sent us home March, told girlfriend matter time we'd full-time WFH. manager kept talking ""when we're back office"" I'd sit meetings wondering lived different planets. 

We got news last month office permanently WFH turns need people office make sales calls middle pandemic online phone anyways. cannot say anything would violate medical privacy. assume concluded related vaccine, otherwise think would resumed quickly. Bullshoes 2 months claiming helping fact increasing risk.

They play politics. We're supposed trust them. Wow. That’s awful. thought “all lives mattered” people. Oh look, 18 year old killed someone, fines would cripple life, go free.


See idiotic sounds? ain't even able keep stockpile masks way stockkpile monkeys.  India doesn’t money infrastructure really real lockdown it’s populated cities. good majority it’s citizens working poor next nothing. Yes r trumpeters r dumb Thing is, know masks help spitting people. 

We still know help minimise spread population level, many need use masks effective.
Social distancing effective already something like half population it, isolation needs almost 90% halt Covid.


I think telling article OP one strongest arguments masks theoretical argument basically says:

A - masks could lessen viral load

B - still get antibodies low loads

ergo 

herd immunity might still viable masks.


We still know herd immunity thing Covid, many infected fast (as know Covid antibodies seem short lived).

As effect masks seems limited best, maybe save professionals properly trained use effectively, put additional strain supply waste infrastructure.

Your best course action still keep 2 m/6 ft away people, wash damn hands.


If close proximity people (like store clerks, etc), think lower risk, might make sense introduce barriers (masks, paper/plastic dividers, gloves) people always gonna talk you, maybe mandatory desinfection people gonna touching things, adaptations make sense workplaces minimise risk.


My local store 2 markings aisles queue register, also plastic sheet hanging front register lessen spit droplets also regularly desinfect counter register.


A restaurant spread tables never sat within 2m anyone outside party, desinfection station entrance restrooms, desinfected tables, chairs, menus pay terminal patrons (as well taking cash). outdoor tattoos set rain fly tattoo outdoors?  parent two (responsible) college students, wish could give multiple upvotes this. hope holding stupid ass covid parties feel demonized along classmates should. shall assume crash position.

Malaysia here, around 70% wear masks outdoors 95-100% large shops security/cameras. cases, pretty much, Malaysians coming home anywhere (and tested treated necessary) illegal workers across porous border Indonesia. clusters generally illegal workers staying crowded accommodation east Malaysia fortunately usually contained well. 

I teaching China breakout occurred actually lived Wuhan 2006/7, watching situation develop carefully. CNY went holiday Thailand friends returned yet, crazy 9 months. cost worth though? Peoples' livelihoods, income, mental health etc also matter. think one concern continues follow assumption virus primarily droplet transmission. would interested see theory holds aerosol transmission proven vector. ""As society can’t even decide illness real not."" COVID? illness referring to, then? Buy sugar gelatine. make peeps. Basically make marshmallows pipe roll fine sugar (blend regular sugar), color add drop food coloring mix well sugar. Trick I've found make sure sugar mixture hot gelatine hold well. I've masking public since March rarely forgotten so. employer also requires daily. Yes, will, efficacy data Phase 3 convincing. However, big if. validate thesis victory claimed?

Edit: idea small doses drive immunity response increases overall immunity (this similar allergy treatments people exposed small doses time - think peanut allergy);

Should sell masks pre-dosed virus? Masks sold delivered weekly sets weekly set slightly higher level viral load. 

If thesis true, maybe washing sanitizing hands much?

Just suggesting might ways get low dose exposure.

Edit: votes? driven scientific proof article truly hypothesis / theory only. It’s reasonable guess point. 

It require significant research prove. 

And like wearing mask, theoretically, shouldn’t antibodies already could measure? guarantee Christmas brutal. It’s even cold US hitting 1000+ deaths. gets cold bioaerosols survive much longer people shopping, even sure deniers keep delusional point.

Except people listened Pelosi visited Chinatown would virus spreaders. 5.4% Good grief, please make masks regular thing pandemic.  I've heard rumors china might few, perhaps already ready prepared covid, special price I’d argue it’s media broadcasting false information that’s leading numbers. people circle nay sayers, anti masks, etc seem fans similar news channels. 
It blows mind country aren’t unified. know smart people believe disappear election. realize considered year long effects... Asymptomatic still contagious. dont understand ? Whatever situation, mask=good , mask=risk. kids still contaminate parents Oooh compliance. live people go parties put masks pictures, even swap uncleaned masks.

The ongoing randomised controlled clinical trials Oxford coronavirus vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 resume across UK clinical trial sites.
Globally 18,000 individuals received study vaccines part trial. large trials this, expected participants become unwell every case must carefully evaluated ensure careful assessment safety.
On Sunday [06/09/2020] standard review process triggered study pause vaccination across global trials allow review safety data independent safety review committee, national regulators. routine follow-up appointments continued normal period.
The independent review process concluded following recommendations independent safety review committee UK regulator, MHRA, trials recommence UK.

Nothing ties reaction vaccine far. it’s possible quickly resumed could mean participant received placebo. 1 18,000 far good. Phase 3 usually 5,000 one lot participants. don’t always attack them. Treading lightly could be

“Ya, definitely believe masks right now. Appreciate asking” mask hold back ashes No. not. confirmed cases. PCR positives. big difference 

Here's article beginning July pretty spot doesn’t help people like Neil Ferguson don’t even follow distancing rules.  This. handle this. saying masks help effort save Healthcare.

However, blame them? People hoarded toilet paper fought it. think would happened regard PPE? 

!remindme 2 months Lool, made laugh Get affairs order.

I’m reflecting first started wearing mask. I’ve cognitive behavior therapy regulating breathing heart rate causes panic. used feel like wasn’t getting enough air, yawn uncontrollably, heart racing. don’t really get feelings anymore hardly notice I’m wearing mask. difference people refuse wear mask use evidence way wear one. people do, aren’t gonna make fuss smart enough realize mask wearing shouldn’t politicized.

Idk think honestly. know tests pretty inaccurate think antibody tests too. no, government officials/overlords know best gage actions tell us do. excuse I'm going chug gallon fish bowl cleaner get hair cut without mask on.  Lol It’s called herd immunity SMFH Same! Expert opinion evidence lowest form evidence reading research articles. Please take grain salt. Officially it'll great success. tbh Someone Lancashire spare 10k? Well blow down. I've noticed that, 'we need open schools kids worse home' narrative. ask plans improve home situations, know, make sure kids enough eat safe space home, thundering silence. Also, schools important, we're going make sure they're well ventilated adequately funded, right? class sizes actually allow one one interaction, superior online, right? Nope. basically schools need open cheap, bare bones daycare parents go back work, got it. I'd respect said that, instead pretending give fuck kids. lot more, bit more. vulnerable people stupid stupid people life absolutely hit first. lot early infections deaths totally avoidable we'd anyone Helm holding reigns. consultant doctor tell masks don’t work bother.. serious autoimmune condition shielding category. 

Now get regular communication telling wear mask go out, course either completely shielding wearing one since early March still blows mind people consultant level education said masks don’t work. vaccine would distributed four phases, health-care workers, elderly people underlying health conditions getting vaccinated first, according group. Essential workers, teachers people homeless shelters well people prisons would next list, followed children young adults. slow curve like everywhere else. Canada slowed curve zero deaths. Like it’s mystery open again, literally hundreds examples Yes, throughout whole pandemic police reasonable. Fines non-compliance (not parties, things like meeting groups start pandemic wandering streets several times day point allowed to) sparingly issued - almost always give chance told first all. If, side 2nd lockdown, everyone wore masks time stayed socially distanced, levels would mildly up. Shut bars/dine-in/theaters/etc vaccine pay workers stay home.

For reason us Americans can't act like grown ups basics needs slow spread. fines keep gaining interest. credit goes shit can't get future mortgage, loans etc. gets job point they'll take wages force pay. Either way, 19, he's paying back point. try maintain staffing levels classrooms, Missouri Board Education made easier become substitute teacher emergency rule. Instead previous requirement — 60 hours college credit — **eligible substitutes need obtain high school diploma, complete 20-hour online training course pass background check.**

i.e., grab willing idiot street.

""education"" Go call someone schizo get steep fine wearing piece cloth close others. Ticket gotta paranoid delusion!

""That's schizophrenia gotta pay fine. refused submit order... control, schizo. gotta pay still!"" - totally schizo is. arrive US, American really relevant. Om nom nom nom.  
It's never enough turd chomper.  
Let's watch come back more, comes appetite shit can't get enough.  
Step aside folks, comes more. Exposing young healthy quickly *would help slow spread.* 

How exactly think we're going come this? Everyone hides fucking homes forever? years? vaccine?

Wasn't *ALWAYS ABOUT* slowing spread hospitals get overwhelmed? Flatten curve? 

The curve fucking flat.  Israel first country go second full lockdown? need worry bigger things Worn mask every time left house since March won’t stopping anytime soon.

You sign Quora Chinese boasting threatening DISGUSTING effective vaccine start going population's arms, we'll finally going hill. Mom totally appreciates that! ignorant people, neither stupid smart mind you, post secondary education makes substantially likely able weed conspiracy theory bullshit fall immediate emotional bait. Never flu. Death rates common cold *extremely* low. BS.

COVID, hand, deadly old people. Totally different cold flu.

And house party breach laws different passing someone street. 

What trying prove? Man Fuck them. they're willing step spew vile lies judge critically deserve quarter. need polite rude people, sure hell give shit make feel.

I'm glad hear brother mend here's lasting complications. I'm pretty sure bunch. 

And reason past generations living died out. see fascism rise again? people left living experienced horrors WW2 understand hateful mindset leads. Yeah, process switching buying beans bulk glass jars local bulk store January. covid hit bunch plastic bags beans. Harley Davidson motorcycle rally last weekend, could why. know *why* go there, although parents prefer Arizona Nevada, really like go Rose Bowl Parade, they're going year. I'm running several errands leave mask rather touch take put back on. Less risky. FWIW think China US may wrong here. China active outbreak vaccinating people outside trial setting unless old, preexisting conditions, elevated risk exposure. Sinopharm employees family members would better waiting conclusion Phase 3.

The US *does* active outbreak probably issued EUAs already frontline healthcare workers, meatpacking workers, attempt demonize China, US media will, like lockdowns it, end making much difficult to, time comes, convince people attacked China doing, case take (much more) fast-tracked vaccine.

It's worse that. Given countries approved vaccines leaning toward early EUA, China Bad, Russia Bad, Trump Bad trifecta play makes rational thought US difficult.

The US vaccines fast-tracked Chinese ones. Pretty much leading candidates worldwide passed Phase 2 none passed Phase 3. Government employees generally side, Trump Party operatives force questionable things. case, seems want obfuscate data looks better Party, still providing accurate, yet less helpful data.

At end July noticed interesting change TX DSHS reporting covid deaths. graphs useful projecting future deaths, changed graphing certificated deaths, deaths given day shrunk 0 graph. still reported number death reports day, began recording August 3, that's blue line graph. red line shows certificated deaths August 3, yellow line shows certificated deaths September 12.

I feel like sound like Charlie Day \_It's Always Sunny\_ meme.

To recap - blue line August 2 number deaths reported day. graphed TX DSHS change July. longer graph data, publish number day, recording since August 3.

The red line number certificated deaths 8/3, yellow line number certificated deaths 9/13. death certificates come in, go back update counts previous days, that's yellow line red line.

On August 3, graph showed 0 deaths day. 9/12, data show actually 193 deaths 8/3. time, yellow line come approximate 7-day average blue line.

Is making sense anyone me?

Anyway, Texas way graph going July change, projected around 7,500 deaths August. turned 6,602 deaths, pretty close considering 7/1 deaths per day 100. look way graphs done though, would hard project numbers would become. since I've keeping track it, tell probably around 4,000 deaths September, even though TX DSHS graph makes look like DSHS Covid  PFE large cap (and previously DOW component) significantantly moved positive negative vaccine news, cuz end day, coronavirus vaccine material them, many drug revenue pipeline going make break company all.

And many vaccine candidates there, really moot point lot large bio tech (AZN, JNJ etc) mess standing/business accelerated program. (Things may hit different smaller companies they've all-in entire resources vaccine candidate).

When vaccines hopefully become available, actually wary despite political BS significant extra scrutiny facing. fought law law won. happens old vulnerable go store? they’re around bunch people aren’t taking seriously cause government told go lives. What’s plan then? 

Also don’t know approach “fuck everyone healthy young” controversial lol Ah. Yeah, don’t need go see doctor get tested. guess US do. average 80% think time, plus minus standard deviation course. It’s fourth year teaching, I’ve already seen much it. area trends conservative there’s community Facebook page follow local news. summer dozens posts people demanding teachers come in-person teach. saw parent student taught first year say teachers willing die. I’m area originally I’ve never planned stay permanently, year really made want leave sooner later. that’s said firefighter live Portland, Oregon area currently worst air quality world...hurray! /s

As already terrified virus before, last days level 2 evacuation wildfire zone (within kilometer level 3), worry even higher risk C-19? 

Cool. Cool. *sigh* think kid got loan school? parents took loan school insead sending free one? what's going here. dangerous? virus go godgilla “Could” it’s unlikely though , like I’m attending frat parties getting extremely close folks don’t know . Ridicule usually works better open societies.

Otherwise siloing truth, exacerbate problem. may true social circle.

Also, thats making lot assumptions given variability people’s support systems. example, likely large amount incoming freshmen left home state first time haven’t chance build connections.

Don’t get wrong, general, young people resilient. However, we’re getting caught writing 18 year olds kids without second thought. 

We remember kids future. lending guiding hand? looking crush kids don’t meet expectations don’t know control them? People make damn decisions based risk assessment, every single person?  Without federal, national mandate financial help federal government, expect work? mean individuals would greater risk dying caught . don't. simply tell old vulnerable risk averse self-quarantine.

The rest society, obviously low risk, go lives. truly understand controversial.   would happy clarify meant you, instead decided cunt it. pretentiousness counter productive.  think it’s shabbat Mate I'm trying tell country do, I'd hope would understand significant lag infections deaths: wait act deaths spike, late. thus we're back square one. engage further. maybe knows lol enforced testing go in...

You're positive, still wanna go in? Ok fella, fun, try kill anyone love remember visit gift shop.

And either seal area maybe napalm? doubt, among educated extremist beliefs, skews everything.

I try differentiate educated vs ignorant, smart vs dumb, nice vs mean, self-centered vs altruistic. things impact “smart” person appears folks course change - although rare imo.

I’m older I’ve concluded nice people best.

Throw emotions mental health well guess stop trying figure people out. teach 8th grade SoCal high desert. district gave us option choosing go in, work home. don’t know it’s hard districts do. personally go (I’m 25, live alone, single) like separate space get work mindset, lot people staying home. It’s working pretty ok. making recommendation individual action, writing policy poster likely 18 year old. Living pandemic. apparently intelligent responsible enough throw party. Sheesh. Well guess never know, try, we? This. lots anecdotal cases now, evidence overwhelming going lot hesitancy reporting (people keep claiming relapse instead reinfection). meantime, MSM stick reporting rare cases reinfection genetically confirmed distinct (rare b/c procedure; necessarily b/c reinfection rare), continue give impression reinfection rare event. could make virus go away actually. take ""panacea"" eradicate one specific disease, least stop issue. manage bar NY. We’ve capacity every weekend well month. It’s disgusting. follow every rule we’re following Governor Cuomos orders it’s insane it’s allowed begin with.

Just tonight 20 people crowd outside waiting get in. Every bar area like this.

I say, Nee Yorkers good masks. Rarely see anyone indoor public place without one on. Even bars one sit down. usually goes window around 11 everyone shitfaced keep yelling put on. CDC **did** basically say low infection rates knew asymptotic transmission. 

The fear people would buy N95+ masks protect wearer; necessarily surgical types protect everyone else see everyone wearing now.

Unless you’re Left Coast trying die smoke inhalation week 😤😷 mean, seems like countries issue. isn’t uniquely American thing.  Well that’s feel, guess take account reason. Thank you.  would like say, science works. get evidence base assumptions pit trial. Later evidence might come makes previous assumptions false. People always got end result science rigorous process trying hard failing trying. first time got sense science works due novel nature cautious approach. Also healthcare workers need protection ordinary people cause first line defence. CDC right make assumption cautiously. Dr. Fauci one biggest advocates condom use AIDS epidemic. lot general population thought otherwise. 30 years later he's pushing mask wearing. Maybe he's something, Educated friends..what mean this? Friend usually company keep similar thoughts with. 

Or story wanted share would paint favorable position? ""I started masking up""... stores enforcing masks people outside? Seems like huge difference.  Well put perspective Canadians considered super polite compared Americans . American believe true.
I look sacrifices people made history others, yet can’t even get people wear mask . 
Remain calm, sorry jerk pulled immature fake cough thing  figure?

Covid \~240 (officially recorded) deaths Lebanon Beirut explosion's official death toll (at least) 190. yes think government hospital management responsible adequately protecting staff.  don’t consider countries struggling right (ie: Peru) strictest lockdowns around world? could consider lockdown fairly lax lockdown...that struggle greater extent. honestly appear connection? large population lacks immunity entirely ticking time bomb - soon case two appears, take spread like wildfire! still don’t know tf still see people know dining restaurants masks everything, get fukin takeout. notice Governors 50 states ordered lockdowns restrictions?  hoping anywhere realm reality. basic education government work would make issue lot less confusing. 

In United States, powers Federal Government powers States have. States power lockdowns. Federal Government not. change next year, regardless elected. shit This. much this.

And many people said tips went curbside only, they're back nearly one tipping curbside pickup, plus indoor dining customers mostly worst customers. know one restaurant/bar says wish everything would go back curbside again, busier then, PLUS feel like open keep everyone else doing. don’t agree. Reasonable people know recommendations change change actions accordingly.

Those mission wear mask find excuse wear mask matter expert medical advice saying start wearing them. Yeah, except retail people refusing wear despite mask orders many companies policies can’t demand safety reasons, since cashiers employees assaulted. w america Please make comments like unless experienced teacher. time people think teachers ""off"" spent grading, creating content, recovering mental emotional beating take school year. Thank acknowledging underpaid underappreciated, please understand hardly ""time off"" relax ""do nothing"". Riding right edge guidelines throwing hands air tips edge. sympathy. Guatemala, right next door, opening 18th. Entering airport people required show negative PCR test taken within 72 hours agree quarantine. mixed messages whether 2 hour nucleic acid test might available Ministry Health Kiosk right airport want quarantine.

Land border crossings quite clear. open sounds like requirements would risk based.   already know storms killed patients. Dude, that’s objectively terrible analogy can’t compare part direct slaughter people. nature actions comparable directly. smart option. lock huge cost, virus levels go down. reopen, people interact more, levels go up. right back started. Love tolerance human compassion sub... Nowhere safe travel, narrative, pandemic.

People stay close home, spreading around unknowingly. Yes letting someone die passive, what? Would evil letting someone die? someone dying front refuse help I'd rather stain clothes want to, would evil? justified let people die sacrifices made? save billions sacrifice single person? Would justified?

The world black white, clear line evil good. Stop trying sound morally superior making absolute statements. always trade offs made. Restaurants make lot money beverages, especially alcohol. no, selling nearly many go drinks make loss. 

Also, servers need dine tips, people tip much, all, takeout. people relying people dining in. 

You make argument way way currently change awhile schools health. /s in, close proximity others airborne pandemic linked transmission lockdown reduces stress that. worldwide effective lockdown would reduce more, less bodies...

Schools reopening, without effective technological measures reduce infection. stressed. Hahahaha ..... people boast keeping th economy alive. reality care funny thing many modern conspiracy ramblings always tie back JFK.  like blues tradition constantly call back Robert Johnson. Q, invoke JFK Jr. He's supposedly alive huge MAGA supporter he's building case pedo Cabal. Whereas India registering daily 100k cases. 

Pakistan truly outshine India covid handling Even reason fly states would spend taxes them, nope, Ebola is. Frankly, I'd rather price reflect realistic situation workers' rights protected. logical conclusion line thinking, anything reduce price acceptable, eliminating labour costs entirely slavery. ethics treating human workers still matter too. mean, matter phrase still collective want US part of. Retail vs service industry pretty different. retail guests aren’t removing masks eating putting back speaking you.

While service industry exactly happens Oooookay. Let's unwind logic chain. Next two keywords ""R number"" ""exponential"". Yeah, wait actual holidays, like Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Boxing Day, go travel spend time family.  People average intelligence generally listen him.

People average intelligence care $ lives listen him. Hehe...as saying goes...""No Shit Sherlock""...

Its reduces Viral Load.

Even kid kicked Science class could figure out. Trump brain 

No LTP 

I wish though need Kid n Play House Party II fresh duo trying outwit authorities rona throw party century. love posts though “we understand virus lot better”. we? Clue long term effects? Eventually experience COVID19 personally one way another rate. like asking it.  Weird. guys part problem. History look fondly Wow probably pretty good course action doubt would considered solution thay involved police since allready knew wrong party calling police wouldnt option. like every neighborhood lean hard way.  Montreal Covid back 300 new cases today 50 cases per day month.  fat guy coughed walking dog mask impress girlfriend last week. People think over, remember started 50 cases less year ago. Smug Canadians thing getting old.  

This turned rant little quickly needed purge. Europe pretty broad larger continent. mention new cases everyone seems care total cases. would love see outcome research study looked correlation anti-maskers, higher std rates group. Really? asked relevant question

Not many people normally die day, matter course?

This “question”. trying minimize number dead comparing baseline deaths excess deaths explained pointed comment nonresponsive question.


Nope, made general statement People hard time answering simple questions lately.

Which demonstrates don’t understand excess deaths illogically jumped insulting comprehension (I assure you, fully understand wrote - doesn’t make responsive question).

You assert like, demonstrate Feeling smart doesn’t mean are. Consider learning logical fallacies spot - it’ll help you. great day!

Lol, logical fallacy commit again? couple weeks ago, city (vegas) used emergency alert system ""urge"" everyone go get tested, symptoms not. set testing centres specifically this. Doesnt tally narrative impossible get tested days. Demand fewer people getting sick. Even sending hundreds thousands people alert, daily test numbers still peak. 

When got tested booked CVS, symptoms required, free. try that? say symptoms Ok, even twice rate, 2000 days... exactly happened Flu pandemic 1918. first wave bad, second wave atrocity. Well, true, sucks big time. Drop Ebola bombs. Wow. concentration camps them? needs new management inclusive vision health health building. 1981, best description generation  sounds spouse receptive.  Maybe start working now.  things take long time. There's several neighborhood snowbird Canada many arriving Late September/October time frame. honestly hope come here, wait least there's vaccine.

If get sick here, American insurance (many get 6 months) SOL, bills crazy. Missouri too. Everyone wearing masks inside live. 10/10. Sweden followed guidelines respected social distancing staying home except necessary. Sure mandate lockdown, probably would citizens comply recommendations. Even so, still rank pretty high deaths per capita due Coronavirus compared rest world.

Only reason lockdowns people bother right thing unless forced so. started well. “We appreciate much still pickup! going stir crazy it’s nice feel sense normalcy!” even though customers kind, ones treat like shit reeeaaalllyyy treat like shit. Yelling us servers mask mandates like decision (I fully support it, still), suburban soccer moms “exempt” masks getting pissy deal outside restaurant, impatient rude people. online order come in, gives pickup time wrote special instructions “make sooner”, got mad wasn’t ready showed early. Well, widespread vaccination always good thing assuming works intended - boosts consumer confidence, alleviates pressure needing test/screen aggressively, potentially open country international travel again.

Based understand, really see emergency use prior completion Phase III big issue. Phase II generally vaccine determined safe. Phase III largely tests efficacy. quite unlikely point there's still something significantly dangerous vaccine know yet. worst happen wasting resources. Fuck this.
Now money power grab government. beyond excessive. 

People commit actual assault, rape battery suffer massive fines. 

Way top. Well shit fully agree hes wrong point never planned 30 people there, wasnt intent yet hes getting full punishment it, likely pay 10,000 even though blame shared. knew breaking social distancing measures theres 0% chance would called police glad camper! gross without Covid! rising though literally one knows long term effects, lots stuff coming long term heart lung damage news, snow cold wet oven hot! too. Even though I'm worried every day work. overall attitude town (and state) non-existent. Even though that's feel, surrounded people go day virus, start let guard time time There’s gun side it, there’s also certain comfort people find conspiracy theories. It’s really fucking scary admit live world someone would walk school massacre kindergartners, virus shut economy, couple hijacked airplanes completely alter track history. Believing puppet masters grand sinister plan, it, palatable some. Even virus 20% deadly, would significant portion populace would become fatigued certain aspects right-wing friend say, ""People going die, might even me. I'm going go around scared bogeyman."" 

On plus side, even hardcore GOP-cult relatives cautious group gatherings, protecting elderly uncle ongoing health conditions. see tabloid news interviews every week commenting predictions future getting involved political soap opera take RV, place seniors complex there. keep pointing complex single case yet. course 100 residents summer 1700 winter. Honestly they're running clock point anyway understand attitude even agree it. Bigfoot exists?? Ahhhhhhh! alt right immune? FWIW there's [mounting asymptomatic carriers (not confused pre-symptomatic carriers) generally transmit virus others share, Chinese Virologist! correlated Minnesota would one hardest hit states summer, weren’t wear high quality N95 mask extremely safe, yes. Even better - wear N100 full face respirator bulletproof intents purposes. family food pickup - pack collapsible pole chairs small table trunk.

So, takeout stays hot eat tree somewhere near restaurant people within 50 feet. It’s great, still feels like “eating out” fun excursion, without risk. places don’t room outside tables, they’re close together. may good use ""both sides"". Central Valley. People still wear them, considerably less even month ago. people house parties, masks, obviously social distancing. Sure, killed lot more, although lasted lot longer Covid has, let's compare years see. Yeah, see that.

No friends invite evening sitting front lawn. (Or front lawn sit on) go hang Applebee's bar shoot shit someone. 
Thank you.

I agree aggressive quarantine called for. 


I'll speak Dr. tomorrow, looks like testing everyone next week.

Give 'rona time settle in!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank answers. Well then, good luck. “volunteered “ small island nations like Nauru. Turkmenistan North Korea claim cases, confident transparent. Idk getting narrative. U.s. built one highest testing rates world relatively low cfr evidence identifying lot cases wear much it’s becoming “natural” forget it’s even on. would compare denmark? Denmark tests almost country It’s disheartening. try get cynical remember lot people right thing it’s really hard. Especially even people thought would know better, also throwing caution wind. evidence throwing party would save lives. Everyone attendance willingly spread virus, guess what, virus spreads. slow can't stop it. Government knew concluded pandemic preparations pointless try control virus. 

Humans basic need contact we're social animals. Zoom cut it. Go beach - perfectly safe outdoors. enjoy outdoors general - hiking, sightseeing, bird watching, boating, whatever people Florida. 

What going Canada stay there? virus present too.  matter? Deaths LOT harder sweep rug, they're falling.

If people asymptomatic, never go hospital, never cause outbreak gets traced back them... problem? Hell, immune. Well......... MSM busy showing Celeb news, really sure.  got lucky happened Mette Frederiksens watch. Seems like born handle something like this. past PMs would done well. go allowed 35. 10000 15 extremly excessive. 500 1000 would enough We’ve same, won’t go eat, we’ll go Target non peak hours get stuff. 

We haven’t bothered staying sorts, it’s really starting wear us 6 months idea people go hospital see unproductive anyway. can't go hospital check covid patients. people trespassed even arrested trying that. Today Robust long lasting. days month so. believe one actually fucking knows right lol God im starting hate back forth information. keep posting incredibly anecdotal video even prove much, since masks guidelines find hugging people anywhere. Stop it. originally advised worn protect supply ppe healthcare workers.

He knew people wearing masks lied save supply. poster justification hating more, obviously. hahaha- good one. live America. don't. think parties going around country long enough now, bigger fines, harsher consequences, likely people get message time shit! working far preferred slap wrist approach. Well tremendous resurgence cases. Kind concern whole region. confirm. Two teachers high school (and three college) retired. convince people conspiracies real mocking along believing things fake?

You drop ""theory"".

The issue conspiracy theories conspiracies happen, cult groupings form theories never correct. defy anyone provide example legitimate conspiracy wide theory movement surrounding prior revealed.

Generally closest example provided someone inside information fought bring conspiracy light. never active theory community surrounding conspiracies.

So conspiracies exist, conspiracy theories ever fiction. already decides 3 week lockdown starting friday like 7 comments last used word wave (outside using reference word) that's want talk end day, know I'm right. 

You know people get lax, cases rise, restrictions snap back. That's part blueprint great on. Keeping diligence. 

So alt, then? lack intelligence read usernames. Got it, mate. 19 fully grown adult lol encurage everyone else same. completely vegetarian vegan diet, jus lower meat consumption. Better everyone :) friend director finance midwestern hospital. They’re hemorrhaging money due lack elective outpatient procedures; cut something like 20% staff. I'm even curious process opening borders (globally) towards US like. Like even vaccine approved tomorrow, would imagine would take months verifications, etc. process indicate enough people immune cases fallen low percentage becomes clear rebound uncontrollably. I'd imagine we'd need instant testing released high volumes better tracing. mentioned, trust US numbers? Administration clearly broken trust order manipulate narrative outbreak. think also extrovert thing. lot people want hang people. Even talking wait staff like socializing them. becomes habit, can't see way get extrovert tanks filled. Groceries? Order online use curbside pickup - straight RV driving south. Gas? Wear gloves. Get vehicle fixed? Wear mask talk car repair shop employees outdoors - they'll understanding given we're talking elderly couple. 

They need cautious ad ICU doctor, viral loads could potentially exposed order magnitude smaller. Downvoted speaking truth. sub unbelievable. live? don’t see people wearing masks, live Riverside county. Happy Cake day!

Yes, plan well, lack enforcement rules making wary even that. isolated due surgery, recovered it, figured could eat outdoor places.

I've three restaurants. least one maskhole wear mask around chin place. one case, maskhole walked right past table. another case, even escorted employee. long you’re thinking outside box, maybe consider possibility teachers vulnerable/scared take sabbatical instead standing way. 

There virus going around that’s deadly people. Unlike illnesses always around school, covid-19 spares children vast majority time. isn’t March. know identify treat high risk patients. That’s death rate isn’t anywhere near peak. plan never hunker indefinitely. 

These aren’t normal times. You’re right. Instead expecting children bear brunt pandemic (admit not, that’s is), it’s time teachers make hard choices own. Whilst agree you, it’s pointless try make people see difference. you’re mindset “government bad freedom good” Cummings always seen equal. Laugh boss's face. reason people ridiculous beliefs people smarter take high road bite tongue. Call fucking moron get back work. Works experience, maybe without cursing depending work environment Hey I'm vegan fuck vaccines Keep eye temperature. Im telling sometimes hardship comes learn live it. would rather things right reality.

Another thing. Life doesnt go shit post grad. new experiences new things. College isnt high point, milestone. make high point, truly suffer leave college. CZ, absolutely pattern  analogy  *aware* numbers?  People tired losing job, missing career start facing months isolation anxiety something (in country, 6 weeks second wave) kills 3 people day (traffic fatalities: 22).  got mad started protests masks social distancing across Europe jokingly said ""do guys steal everything us?"". Welp 🤷🏻‍♂️. They're saying exact bullshit people said summer. ""It's testing. dead people?"". Probably exact thing people say weeks things get bad again. Ha. us actually remember UK gov changing entire tactics several times March April. Black death example? allowed 30 Pakistan testing shit. India Pakistan's testing ratio(tests/million population) similar till 6000s. till June-July period, India's testing ratio stands 40,000+ Pak sitting duck 13k+, billion people India Pak. absolute numbers, Pak testing approx 30k day, India 1.2 million day. California 22 cases per million 25 deaths per million. population 40 million. Jong Kong? Junited Kingdom? shit   agree there. need drastic action enact change. response protests police force disgusting. riots protests symptoms rot system. surely criminal negligence. Chinese virologist tells likes clickbait media love that. Next week: Man says scientific proof bigfoot exists. barbers hairstylists near offering outside haircuts tent roof umbrella. Buzzing short cut doesn’t require much equipment sinks. Google one town? sure many countries vying become No.2. Huh...? But...italy? What? 100,000 cases daily basis make consider ramifications, know will, thought month people understand know wrong. key part assuming “ultra-weathly” pay all. won’t. global. influence politics. mastered ever loophole know new ones. upper-middle middle class pay it. say “they already do” many people may pay M4A. 
It’s different lifestyle. Sure much Europe “free” healthcare uni. average middle-aged European professional much less wealth American counterpart. typically rent, use public transportation, less disposable income. Americans likely homes, cars, disposable income. Getting lazy complacent it. wave dynamic makes lot.more sense now. love kind stuff too. similar vein, Ive watching Historia Civilis channel YouTube, amazing job breaking history Roman empire, especially battles.  lot thought, don’t feel sorry though. He’s adult. wouldn’t feel bad 50. He’s grownup testing law see bluff, even news coverage wants depict like boy bullied adult world. 

And heck make example. Frosh week madness. others decide throw parties take chance breaking law, fill boots consequences.

(That said, teaching moment, one dies result, suspect fine eventually quietly lowered thrown appeal.)  “Works well far”? read day majority cases days ages 10-19... almost number daily cases peaked ... missing here? go. Stop looking reassurance reddit you’re good noodle. know risks, know mitigate them, know works. point you’re going decide you’re comfortable one else make decision you. willing shut economy reduce traffic fatalities. talk lockdowns number daily deaths covid significantly exceeds number. Spoiler alert: nowhere near close atm. literally try tell parents exactly, care. think big deal, infuriating. risks tiny young people. people get long covid find cleared months and, importantly, post-viral syndrome uncommon virus. 

A young person responsibility elderly person immediate family. free socialise way want. virus coming everyone case. 9/11 nothing compared this. exposed fake patriotism is!! easy say” never forget 9/11” go bomb 3 world countries nothing 9/11. Covid real test patriotism failed!! called patriots don’t care 194 thousand Americans died. throw covid parties shame people wear mask act like elderly Americans subhuman. patriotism go???? What's scarier someone thinks COVID hoax ignored? Someone thinks wearing mask makes bullet proof. average safety protocols work! death rate would much higher everyone idiot kid did! hard understand? That's alt. I've responding multiple basketball conversation time. Jeeze, man, sorry I'm memorizing user name. That's pretty egotistical you, btw. 

And yes, propagating dangerous misinformation. saying big multiple waves inevitable. not. countries that.  going personally since longer back saying. hurt people kind misinformation posting. stop it, love good.

Grand Empress Orange Troompa Loompa lied everyone promised Covid-19 hoax would disappear Easter like miracle original 15 cases would quickly become 0.


There's actually audio tape stating constituents mentally strong enough handle truth. telling truth may cause fragile minds panic.

Spanish flu dangerous young people. young people think high risk dying they'll behave differently. want put grandmother danger, go see her. can't expect people put social lives hold virus mainly kills elderly. expect flu accept trade certain number deaths price worth paying normal life. Protests represent community outreach. Parties represent egocentric self-gratification. understand difference? Maybe become clearer later  think true honest. Brexit I'm also hard lockdown it. got variety pack silk masks (with pocket filter inserts) dark floral prints honestly feel adds much tropical goth ensembles. I'm wearing like every two weeks barely leave house, do, enjoy extra accessory also happens life saving that.

My point is, lean aesthetic masking! happier it. income got crushed (self-employed) qualify unemployment. $1,200 something anywhere near needed. Nearly every human death ultimately caused oxygen getting brain. People refuse believe doesn’t happen directly them. understand downvotes here. absolutely right. government needs lead example. Public apologies paying fine absolute must.

I feel like I'm watching absurdist film.  Rough timeline Maybe vaccine masks made along way Yes, demographic free risk dying suffering serious consequences. certain demographics conditions dramatically higher risk them.

Someone elderly, overweight, diabetic, etc, taking significantly precautions given risk. mean others taking precautions. Based read, asthma thankfully one conditions associated significantly risk. Yeah understand agree saying. absolutely right accounts. 

The issue loopholes destructive some. got link straight Dr. Francis lol. I’ve following twitter thread he’s scathing criticism.  That's France, worldwide fancy local variants.

While French, work Switzerland, university, tell colleague (scientist) stop publishing anti-mask nonsense claiming pandemic over. 

We pretty decent scientific board advising government, understand can't see crisis science lens, prime minister asking people please serious masks gels. people wearing yellow vests, broke confinement rules buy cigarettes wine, traveled across whole country grill butts beach bring back sunny photos nice viral collection.

What honestly expect people?

At point I'm completely hopeless humanity. FF/EMT here...and amount disregard masks unreal. I’ve never heard bitching whining. mean trade deals destroying good jobs ones destroyed needing college degree put people whole debt. real recovery lower income people Great Recession. can't herd immunity without vaccine. infection rates would slow reach herd immunity new births population movements would cause ebb flow decades.  Yawn two independent variables similar lead nearly identical results, make reasonable argument similarities larger studies may suggest. idiots, reality problem everyday.  good leader lot :/ won’t anyone mention History Channel??? Shows like Ancient Aliens made people suddenly think things don’t understand explained ridiculous easy grasp bullshit. Please lock avoid lockdown? would smartest thing do, there's appetite it. worry fall winter we're taking 40,000 cases fall winter. think going bad. probably believe 9-11 real Don’t antibodies survive week? almost 3,000 April despite fewer cases compared now.

You good basis saying that. far less access testing back then. Oh fucking god. former server bartender. top tier dumbfuckery.  let people know others fever.


It's useless reopen can't even filter people known fever.



Especially given main point people may false sense security.


A point people false sense security want go 100% back normal asap ignore. N95 KN95. I’ve read valve doesn’t help, got it. safe going parties ever be. age group flu deadly nobody would ever tell go party case get flu die.

Zero community transmission going happen without curtailing civil liberties indefinitely. I'd rather take chances virus. Life risk free. And, even vaccine released soon (unlikely) antibodies shown fade therefore still infected symptoms spread virus vulnerable (who respond well vaccines). Besides, vulnerable want get it, they'd better staying home taking precautions (like immunosuppressed people always done) don’t see good way anyone who’s high risk sacrificing another 1-2 years life.

Why think 1-2 years would enough? indication disappear entirely opposed low level, constant issue learn live with? fucking Republican controlled legislature Wisconsin overriding Democratic governor's mask mandate mandates trying ya know, keep beautiful people safe.  “Live within means” old Republican talking point. Blaming people suffering. People refusing acknowledge financial economic hardships before. 2 case. Kinda. Thanks. last time, lying, immensely anal. 

You seem confused. **You** lying. called it. described problem detail you. yet failing even comprehend idea gotten something wrong. discussion. made fantasy loudly arguing caricature they're saying they'd love take rinky-dink working vaccine might never produced scale. sounds reasonable. 

No reasonable. never said suggested it. lie. clearly concluded actually debating say impossible. keep lying pretend winning argument. Holy fuck. Philosophically, it’s absurd premise even debate. don’t know risk initially, wearing mask tiny effort, downside wearing mask, even it’s best case scenario, orders orders magnitude worse effort financial investment make getting mask. perfect demonstration fundamentally illogical human beings be, nature. Plus article includes Norway, EU. ""Europe"" tends defined around 740 million people. idea article includes Russia though, shave 140 million that. I'm Saskatchewan &amp; roommate finished 14 day quarantine vacationing Delaware &amp; Pennsylvania. USA still allows Canadians travel country.

Edit: apparently can't even spell province, haha. 

*banjo noises* discussion yesterday FB someone 6% CDC thing. tried explaining comorbidities death certificates work. kept denying saying worked 30 years data management knows read chart. 

I asked ""Suppose correct 6% total COVID death count actually COVID. data expert, explain excess mortality data goes beyond offical COVID death count far 2020 US around world.""

That's got called ""sheeple"" use brain come conclusions. respect fascist bigot. teacher’s pay says lot career. did? Spanish flu, far deadly, evoked similar attitudes. last one comparable size swine flu far bad sars-cov2.

And yes, time one person endangers others throwing frickin' party - find non-essential things like party happen I'm person liked rave last year least. incredibly tiny sacrifice compared life might continue instead ways get serotonine fix. basing entirely difference 2 cruise ships? bet huge demographic difference two ships. masked ship still average asymptomatic rate. first ship 20% rediculous virus implies old people Nope. I’ve tried channels already got thrown loop. area pretty much anti mask get going chain lands pretty much unemployed. can't carry economy. 

But rich, hold tank many small businesses. people become scared really economy. 

But hand, prolong pandemic ineffectively social distancing masking. LOL. Given I'm minority, immigrant wman, dare anyone find privilege background. I'm also youngest child big middle class family never counted helps parents. way around: helped support parents financially retirement. earned every cent today. Call crazy, seems like one place *definitely* abundance surgical masks available pandemic, would hospital. weren’t stocked up?

That would make simple distribute healthcare workers need them, hospitals could simply pay masks, themselves, rather relying general public make donations, etc., isn’t efficient, reliable, least. thought stock photo, saw one guy mask who’s clearly wrong place. like someone user name “CumBlaster1200” thinks standing lecture us public policy 🤣 love country problem first tactic find race associated problem fuckwads rush attack race, even though nothing problem :(. 

I’m sorry dealt did. :(. Lots people suck unfortunately. Wa soon, ID MT, etc. family N100 respirators covid, need anytime go outside. air quality ""hazardous"" level week now. deaths click box. sorts good data too. It’s new Where’s Waldo, took second find him. research paper, perspective article. concept sounds interesting certainly appealing - translate backed data regarding generation immune response. Performing animal studies seems like reasonable approach confirming whether hypothesis true not.

Regardless, wearing masks even past ""end"" pandemic, conjunction physical distancing, drive transmission rate. Curbside pickup great hope never goes away. car eating done it.  I’ve never heard song heard it, care it, song means it’s time go home, it’s favorite song. somebody who's anti-chiro whole life really simple that. fix scoliosis? No. make fucked lower back muscle feel better days go work tell stretches flare back up? Maybe. depends. 

But like they're quacks degree palm readers. They're good things. blood loss killed me, Jason voorhees let people make feel bad need mental health. Hope fun! went restaurant (outdoor seating) friend's birthday today, amazing Protester : ""bUt RiGhTs!?"" mask real deterrent virus, way would staple people's faces. Bet would save 1000's lives too. (FYI I'm UK mask uptake pretty decent outspoken neanderthals)  know necessary fib. could published guides make masks early on. price gougers would sit heavily devalued products. helpful skilled people could made masks hospitals tide over. Instead outright lied. Really glad ignored early advice, made common sense.  Thank Christ.  think cool. reason masks themselves. feel like I'm kind ugly always thought eyes one best features. mask honestly makes feel better myself. sounds really sad I've typed it. Ah, see mean. Sorry, bit facetious.

It looks like indeed treat seriously separate act law, introducing measures enable courts treat even seriously. good Source claim? actually blue-ish light. said back late April friend would call crazy say ""I definitely see thing lasting August""  looked mom scar arm read stopped giving smallpox vaccines scars 1972, must something else. helpful all. Mitchell Mcturtlefuck anything it! family control mask wearing, got virus hearts exploded pressure. 9,000 people died covid, 191,000 happened maybe Covid died average 3 causes Maybe time reread source, age group 15-24 likely die Covid 19.

Vaccines work exactly natural infection, many work similar all. Quick googling gave number like 0.4-0.6% likely, although one know sure course could higher lower. Personally guesstimate would lower. Nope. spouse would file sorts affidavits unless comes with, he's also dual citizen he's also banned entry. 

Essentially, ""leave myself"", ""jump ridiculous amount hoops"", ""stay US family"". Long term, if/when travel ban gets lifted, might seriously push us become expats though. I'm UK so.... Nah it’s cool. wanted people correct something saw it, appreciate sentiment. fact they're nothing shameful beyond words.

Mitch McConnell try uh... prevent lawsuits employers unsafe working conditions. V-shaped recovery time now! Thanks! missed one.  Happened nearly two months family came Covid. Finally went away, hang hopefully you’ll turn corner soon. Wife symptoms related Covid months. She’s finally getting better. People really downplay long term effects. Anything short hospitalization considered “mild”, people don’t understand affect quality life. fortunate empathetic engaged doctors. wonder Trump hates masks much, rofl! Yep. 

And tell excess deaths compared years deaths under-reported, over-reported. Trump cultists justify crap says. Yes, I'm anti-masker either. believe making mandatory inside (if based proper evidence) reasonable restriction civil liberties (if regularly reviewed). problem close nightclubs, young organise private parties. way stop massive fines really want stop it. It's, unfortunately, way stop people things perfectly normal things do. disagree course. single viral particle enough cause infection. unlikely true. cases dropping lot lately though? Lazy teachers wanting longer holiday. People smart enough get proper job ended teaching easy good enough proper job /s.

Sadly many people think something like (my wife teacher - works really hard it). nurses ... care workers..... number professions. willing die better tomorrow?   pandemic likely go history straw broke camel’s back 40 years poor economic decisions.

You’re commenting reddit. Clearly time valuable American Football, it’s themesong NFL broadcast. They're allowed per Master Settlement Agreement. Yes, do. middle pandemic age group present party (late teens) danger flu. think really appreciate risk absolutely tiny. 

New Zealand western country (note I'd rather live virus kinds restrictions seen China etc.) come close community transmission still massive curtailment civil liberties. go there, even citizen, put quarantine expense. also miles away country. And, know what, still outbreaks community transmission. 

&amp;#x200B;

Vaccines work provoking immune response includes production antibodies (just like would happen person infected). way vaccines work. Plenty young people symptoms tested found extensive heart damage. they're oblivious it, mean shorten life lower quality life. need rude. dreams desires. look medical consensus anything could risky. tend tip stupid money curbside. Probably half reason even bother getting curbside support people work there. suck. One that’s friend mine, bartender..I happy find found less risky job meantime. comes sides might want tighter seal Definitely denial. 9 months I'm sympathetic. don’t fucking understand what’s happened country.

Trump. People back-justifying inane lies. come time crisis thanks effort leadership healthcare workers, scientists, researchers, EMTs, food workers millions others chose believe science took upon wear mask, social distance get vaccine comes out. hard battle fought, 200K dead countless others got incapacitated chronically ill virus. 

Then one day, over, assholes come say country exaggerated death toll bad. I've seen couple friends facebook suddenly became virus epidemiology ""experts"" March, claiming soon die exaggerating. They've STFO since we've reached grim milestones family members personally affected this. suspect coming years, they'll try gaslight history experiences claiming bad could been; refusing acknowledge effort help us overcome this. girlfriend planning getting place Rona hit. lost job luckily secured 6 month contract fairly quickly. it’s long term thing. 

She takes we’re living together see eachother week most. works high risk industry(grocery). also refuses wear mask goto park together even though beg to. We’ve sex since March. 

I love death don’t think take anymore  Whose reporting recommend? SG made statement asking people leave PPE healthcare professionals March 8th due shortages. April 4th (when supplies recovering) encouraged public use PPE, CDC immediately began publishing recommendation. April 6th released document claiming PPE ineffective-- mention reserving medical professionals shortages mostly over, correct mid June.

I mean, that's went down. understand need bring insults sarcasm this. That's way mouth breather gang going upvote nonsense. 1st wave Act III around me, people starting get ""covid fatigue"" longer following rules half wearing masks ""dont get trouble"" shit. nobody taking serious anymore april - june. How? get maniacs line vax. easy all. get autism mask then? one likes hearing parents good areas called idiots, he's wrong. folks Republican sheep think question they're supporting. worked store year. wore masks unless outside taking trash, eating break room, used restroom. 

But one took seriously half employees wore covering chin. 

There handful us wore right time. Ebola actually deadly ""deadliest pathogen"" mortality rate prevented virulent Covid-19 HIV. hoarding driven toilet paper shortage time, know said ""everyone mask up"" thousand people would masks, Healthcare workers would go without. Well, bar set pretty low. Thank kind sentiment. Got mine week. pleasantly surprised wait, shot performed social distancing intact!! US Population - around 330 mil
US Confirmed Cases - 6.5 mil (meaning 1.969~% population)
US Covid Deaths - 194,000 (meaning 2.984~% cases resulted death)

SWEDEN Population - 10.23 mil
SWEDEN Confirmed Cases - 86,505 (meaning 0.845~% population)
SWEDEN Covid Deaths - 5,846 (meaning 6.757~% cases resulted death)

I kinda wanted math :) obviously since Sweden smaller population, amount cases makes sense think? plus universal healthcare! amount deaths proportion population confirmed cases even higher US! sorry it’s formatted weird i’m mobile :( quite. She’s first western female became Tibetan monk. speaks letting go expectations, learning become comfortable change, life change. 

I find navigating area acceptance wanting world different place tough. world changing way don’t find acceptable really hard, it’s something we’ll deal age grow sick old, regardless pandemic not. end well. daughter took proper precautions still caught COVID.

Oh, god, going end like flu shots, it? years, half people I've talked like, *Yeah, got shot, still got damn flu. shot shit.* half people going like, *I wore mask, still got damn covid, masks shit.* they'll spread little anti-masker friends ... Same. I’m proud. no, it’s government trying control you!! course, government clear... guess it’s fun prank something... anyway, don’t government tells you! Unless it’s police telling black person something! means India million tests day, million unreported cases day.  mean, dude thinks windmills cause cancer. hear say ""that man smart"" well, gotta bridge sell you. Honestly blame falls people. CDC always said masks work... told everyone refrain making run them... Healthcare workers needed could still get them. obviously means work. bought damn toilet paper day one... needed protect mask supply. People may gotten message game telephone masks work... truth would always anti mask contingent. however become huge movement sign protest thanks President dumb come. subreddit became political. Masks always made people ""immune"" , subreddit continued support facts, go back forth covid good, covid bad.

News flash covid bad, news flash masks always worked even back march. Username checks really think wanted prevent run masks. Americans paranoid hell. Ammunition emergency food still scarce. sat several interviews week head honcho. first pulled away face talk (to candidates, directly across table). last interviews mask around chin whole time. uncomfortable enough, felt bad candidates. say person highest position authority taking seriously, know? No. looks like bitchy Karen posts hourly Facebook. im willing bet cant grasp asymptomatic concept, straight dont care dont think serious. Like people legit think wearing mask gonna poison somehow. One case case. Thanks. really sucks best. Social media completely destroyed people thought good, honest folks. Including ex. understand otherwise good people dragged easily. hypothesis based hypothesis. first hypothesis [(in )) posted sub 3 days ago mislabeled find/study. I’m doctor, give explainlikeim12.

Virus particals measured doses, like drugs. Viruses, like drugs, LD50 (a dosage lethal 50% people).

Researchers suspect healthy individuals small infectious doses SARS-Cov-2 might give body time analyze fight/beat virus multiples inside body enough cause symptoms. [April (early) article infectious dose viral dose often studied humans unless volunteer purposely infected virus. [Influenza virus inoculum volume critical elucidate age‐dependent mortality ways reduce viral exposure theoretically higher chance asymptomatic case:

* Proximity control virus
* Wearing mask
* Washing hands
* Wearing shield
* Etc

Many articles saying should, interpreting things incorrectly. 

For example saying “weaken virus” isn’t accurate describing happens either inside outside body. Wearing mask reduce infectious dose, virus might affect less. virus weakened.

Also, masks don’t give immunity: body gives you/gains immunity fights virus. 

Asymptotic cases ) [may result strong immunity. 

If see something wrong info jargon, please let know. want express information accurately. That’s pathetic... :( one AA meeting couple days ago wearing mask. sat away everyone hell? don’t care “stand out” anymore.  ""People claiming"" ""we told"" helping understand point is.

Are saying someone misleading you? Who? How? Why? correct. I've treating covid ecmo patients months covid essentially full body disease due clotting. We've heart strains, strokes, kidney liver failures, lungs gone shit, etc. point buy groceries gas... maybe get vehicle fixed. impossible drive far exposure. N95s effective wearer. people idea hard PPE doff PPE way cause contamination. completely left importance washing hands touching surfaces. Source: ICU RN Nawwwww! mean sitting packed resturant employees wearing masks going cause virus spread?? Fuck tell so! it’s easier sanitary leave take put repeatedly forget half time anyway Fauci lie? would read comment, would understood people taking Social distancing lightly.

PS : People using masks sanitizers cases still rising. total neoliberal takeover France

One strongest welfare states world.

Massive taxes.

High unemployment due smothering job market regulations.

""Neoliberal takeover"" gonna lie, somewhat anti-mask bit. early days, scientists doctors saying ""you need wear mask"" whereas people advocating mask usage seemed mostly doomsday preppers Facebook moms paranoia hobby. Unsurprisingly, listened doctors. Well, turns preppers Facebook moms right once. think little early declare that, curiosity though pandemics comparing to, Spanish flu obviously one others? I'm going directly home, I'd rather touch mask. Unless hot breathe easily, I'll leave take get home disinfecting process. Disinfectant wipes phone keys, hand washing hands. Question - able transition education background? Nice whataboutism.

My grandmother lives third world country trade sanctions. left refugee along family child since parents dissidents.

What's excuse giving shit sick elderly? country war, trade sanctions? people country give damn sick? Fair question. there's blatant disregard, parent says, may make sense fine people involved.

If know AIDS unprotected sex abandon, twisted people done, see problem fines least associated costs treating anyone caught you.

Sadly, people shit know bad consequences small none. hefty fines make lot people think twice. default fine, last resort fine. People need take responsibility part spread virus. far able prove link. find chef infects bunch people cooked food contact with, I'm sure they'll update info. true, distancing schools here.

My niece regular school since lockdown. cut classes smaller classes avoid many kids room - enough rooms actual school that. 

So class taught place, DISTANT pupils.

They also bunch rules like share others smartphones pens stuff - exchange objects general.

As well, happened quite times schools got closed down, close couple weeks one case.

No masks true.

It works well though tbh. [Yes, Dole factory last revision FAQ six months ago. think probably new information available point. updated? orange keeps putting cities, clear economic push bring needed. big numbers box office without la nyc noticed decrease mask usage well. schools open, colleges open, less mask usage. 

Just time flu season.  wonder end? beginning makes sense me. still excuse reopening *cries indian* According Wikipedia page they've one product even make phase 1 trials entire history company. title rephrased ""lockdowns"". COVID cause this, lockdown measures did. sliding scale. hard lockdown 6 weeks would likely put halt virus, yet would cause deaths hunger etc. opposite side also holds true, lockdown = covid death. yes right doesnt disappear hits outdoor, gets dispersed concentration low safe gather. indoors (with almost air circulation) virus stays afloat virus concentration air. 

a comparison might understand throwing bag salt pot full water gives salty water, throwing bag salt lake/river almost impact salt level water amount salt needed raise salt concentration exponentially higher. say BLM protesting! Although different countries scales authoritarian leaders, tens thousands protesting Belarus Russia mostly wear masks police seemed left alone. That's actually works.

It doesnt matter send money non-profit spend directly, bottom line get taxed still drops.

They harder track supporting who. main reason return keep Canadian insurance. Yup, shit like going make people replace social distancing masks disease particularly exceptional. actually relatively mild compared pandemics history. hope restaurant spoiled community. ♥️ Thanks caring going extra mile crew. much per pound? Wearing mask unnecessarily much better wearing mask necessary. really big deal wear one circumstances.

In fact, even covid probably continue wear mask typical flu seasons. reason never people would look like I'm crazy. hope there's mask acceptance covid.

However helping reduce impact covid, help seasonal flu. Getting sick sucks, even put coma gives permanent organ damage. like way think government wants virus move population, killing sick, disabled elderly. mean comply spread faster! want punish government inaction, make sure many targeted groups survive!

Doing right thing house parties resist government! Conservatives Kier Starmers Labour believe there's thing society. us prove wrong protect neighbours community. 

We need government protect weaker members, need write equation. Instead mindless lemmings government wants, responsible community. 

The thing evil needs succeed, good people nothing. price party could done students done city. Helping vulnerable shielding making sure food supplies, venture put risk.

Meh, RV probably worth something. Go get tow coffins home. I'm confused, saying hosting house party middle pandemic good idea? know thats way thinking. Last checked dont need store flu death bodies uHaul vans fridge trucks Cases deaths spiking though nervous. slow rise since June, we're getting closer closer numbers posted start. definitely think people losing steam. live North Dakota let confirm people wont put fucking mask.

Mask requirement Target, Walmart, Starbucks Lowes, thats pretty much it. Bars still operating, people still going movies.

Guarantee would parties. like glimmer CAN-adian. 😜 Yeah, saying article said weren’t sure they’d wait 2021 start it, feel they’ll likely start year. Don’t even try talk logic people. countries done it, possibility issue “after issue beating us up.”

A couple weeks pressing pause button bills, debts etc hardcore lockdowns would obviously measurably better half year crippling economic mental/social torture.

And isn’t even hindsight 20/20, countries start.

It absurd still seen “infeasible” we’re except loosely Facts people birthday suddenly become model citizen. Early pandemic, old bulk supplement supplier sent N95 mask $80 order. checked website, wanted $18/ea masks. back find anywhere--in part scumbag companies like buying price gouge. gave free sample RN wife, otherwise reasonable access masks despite dealing dozens dozens COVID positive patients day. 2 dozen coworkers eventually died COVID. wonder better access PPE would changed that? live fucked world. thoughts exactly daughter quarantine everyone. Probably least week regardless test result.  Quarantine means stays room needs go common area house wears mask times outside room limits time necessary go bathroom type need. spending time room anyone else. Anything else like food delivered door bedroom.  Clean surface touches. designate bathroom use mo one else would even better. rest family isolate. trips leaving house least week. visitors. 

Unfortunately negative test early signal everyone safe. means yet positive. takes exposure enough virus body test detect it. likely get tested stops quarantining. 

Obviously doctor give definitive time frames that's general idea expect hear. two options:

everyone gets tested asap. rapid test 100% accurate test, possible daughter gets false negative test.

OR

no test yet, stay isolated checked temperature daily 2 weeks. Positive test mean hospital admission, practice, 2 week quarantine likely required, test not. 1. Could still enough herd immunity 
2. makes massive difference either way 
3. Vulnerable people would probably likely get vaccine Good This. parents complaining seeing constantly. told straight back July coming (central IL) see holidays. may well well spring summer next year see them. Without vaccine, I'm going anywhere coming here. way I'm giving could possibly close ""the end."" looks like Vaccine option here

You believe sanitizer, masks, social distancing options? There's difference typo writing something makes sense. Sheep What’s wrong coffee shops? starbucks allows mobile ordering moment limited amount people inside moment. also ask pick drink you’re touching people’s drinks trying find yours. feels pretty safe obviously there’s risk involved going there. feels safer going grocery store Target. Exactly. weather nicer live, husband picking food taking lake nearby eat it. Beats eating noisy restaurant day. honestly never can't imagine why. Evidently yes  guess what? things 1918 1920 spanish flu. first, everyone listened...but came anti maskers, pro freedom, anti w/e people devolved ""if going get it...might well live die""

humans stupid. natural way thinking overall. didnt get far smart, got far ignorance stupidity. choosing ignore many things pretend ok. matter 120,000 die, matter millions die...its good man. Oh sucks mean, area anyway teachers take leave absence come back next year, stipulations it’s like next year hiking teacher jobs. 

Those classes don’t exist. feeling alt. replied comment chain, either can't read usernames got confused account made initial comment fucked up.

It's ""dangerous misinformation."" Even BEST blueprints around world people getting lax stricter standards reinforced. Shit, even New Zealand got lax let couple go funeral 2 weeks snap back.

The problem obviously inability parse information simple username scan highlights that. 400 plenty long good, representative sample Moderna still reputation worry about. botched product likely kill company. Read article properly read around research. 1:80 undercounting May-June period, based current numbers. I'd say India still undercounting, way way worse May-June period. Atleast brought testing numbers 1.1-1.2 million day. per reports, large number places finally offering free testing Central Government finally removed/increased cap number tests states day. I’m still thinking March things start relaxed Memorial Day/early summer everything normal Literally nothing vegan want technical. Yes, early stages get false negative.

 rapid antigen viral protein tests allowed India dramatically increase testing capacity 1.1 million day, quicker, cheaper test less reliable retesting often recommended. India suddenly disappeared? guarantee people - even educated people - could tell difference co-morbidities Perez ting conditions. Scientific papers published absolutely regard PR. scientists don’t recognize dangerous poor presentation fOlLoW ScIeNcE! Oh, Reddit. Never stop.  Maybe [immunity] wears eventually still know

Best guesses vary 2-4 months, believe. really don’t even need take mask off. Simply asking another person cares whether keep tells need know person.  today also told permanent effects virus.

What reading? There've articles many months long-term effects. guess hoping get paid stay home ramp production part would enough. didnt consider predatory capitalist system garbage humans be. someone old still naive times. Wishful thinking, guess. Well, everything seems obvious also true. responding anti-mask trumper spreading much possible shift blame spread misinformation. He's also calling biden rapist/racist asking blm stop rioting tells anything. agree people seem grasp asymptomatic concept. 

The two houses behind house constant gatherings parties. think understand one could picked virus somewhere asymptomatic spread whole group. 

I longer believe people really think - minds grasp pre-formed ideas presented media passed along others. ""Masks suck"" seems much commonly grasped idea ""anyone could asymptomatic carrier"". pray person edited article. Wear mask toilet paper debacle somewhere too.  Keep stigma going people mental illnesses. It’s something need America. Fauci’s management AIDS crisis reprehensible and, many ways, mass murder, claim created HIV bullshit. Source that? deadly alarming? killed 200k people United States since January, months businesses shut limited travel. stands we're probably going break 300k end year. death toll would likely millions action taken all. wear sick crowded places post-pandemic, would would make ridiculous statement like this? Lemme guess, think concerts never happen either? keep well - long keep enforcing mask use, especially out-of-state visitors. add TP thing, actual hoarders fraction reason selling out. real reason many people suddenly staying home, using much TP home rather work school mall wherever, typically stocked thin crap sold bulk consumers don’t generally access purchase, probably wouldn’t want use home anyway. needed reason smug little asshole.

California, mask gotten even useful fires made air quality awful That’s unfortunate think 40,000 new cases day last forever. flipside, people giving social distancing speak. 

Are they, though?

Or see anecdotally? would saying since mid July?

From case counts, numbers keep dropping. shall see dip since ~5th due Labor Day testing slowdown not, 5 days now, think clear evidence shows still effective job distancing enough slow spread. Maxines people wore masks, one would get immunity, though virus would still spread, slowly.

No, no. number people less 100%, masks less 100% effective. Cloth masks 100% effective, told lot, *reduce load*, get little virus... ideally, enough dose trigger immune response without enough get seriously ill. 

It's like accidental vaccination relies upon masks *not* perfectly effective. True subgroups way way lower fatality rates. 20 year old females around 1 10,000 chance lower die SARS2 infection. adminidtrating vaccine many side effects might unethical specific group.

There point arguing someone making visit awkward day worse never another visit her. what? really believe governments caring? reduced viral load explained start, clearly

It clear significant factor, though theory several months.

So instead telling everyone, ""There definitive proof covid spread aerosol, need wear face coverings"", said, ""To safe side, wear face coverings definitive proof covid spread aerosol"". way convince people anything true, factual, authentic.

We already knew that.  theory merit explains things. Like Starbucks South Korea 56 cases 4 staff, wore masks entire shift, tested negative despite going duties. problem they’re following scientific protocols expense citizenry? yet, headline still incorrect. Masks ""cause"" immunity, immune system does. Masks reduce viral load would correct.

They'll fine, thanks. No. based decision early [reporting  
Data individuals aged 18 years old suggest relatively low attack rate age group (2.4% reported cases). Within Wuhan, among testing ILI samples, children positive November December 2019 first two weeks January 2020. available data, absence results serologic studies, possible determine extent infection among children, role children play transmission, whether children less susceptible present differently clinically (i.e. generally milder presentations). Joint Mission learned infected children largely identified contact tracing households adults. note, people interviewed Joint Mission Team could recall episodes transmission occurred child adult. 

You appear latched piece evidence confirms hypothesis ignoring evidence doesn't. emails interesting course, show considering options should. worry me. really go herd immunity would convince Director-General, Johan Carlson, appointed government he, turn, would convince government go route. prove something like happened, I'll take seriously.

Any decision like logged since contradicts already existing planning serious departure stated goals planning. decision unearthed. course claim unofficial decision kept us, silly would believe would need hide perfectly rational decision based best judgement?

Lab origin theory zero, nothing going here.

Taking serious really religious thinking.

Religion also starts X possile, jumps ""we know X"", skipping everything ""it could happen"" ""we know happened"".

Lab origin theory also religious sense people cannot bear psychologically pandemic started moron wanted pet bat whatever.

You want human activity design cause. cannot accept sometimes random stuff happens. 

Hurricanes need caused evil gods whatever, happen reason. Pandemics also need caused evil people - happen time, they're part nature. I'm England. Masks mandatory shops public transport, people willingly wearing half wear wearing properly. Barely anyone wears one outside. Social distancing went window months ago, everyone behaving like there's virus. There's big movement towards 'not listening experts' last five years so. much Fuck Everyone Else culture. nonsense.. Belarus 100 thounsands people protesting month... masks social distancing.. lockdown whatsoever.. Yet national corona crisis, hospitals fine, bodies lying street either.
Unless virus smart attacking people protesting mainstreem media agenda. Yup. Schools reopened, mostly young people symptoms. Test rate also increased. mostly young people symptoms, go hospitals since affect them, moment okay. problem might transmitted older persons. Might wait weeks apologies take one back. sound like one researchers whose funding could threatened public backlash.

Anyway, re: science falsification, lack substantial amount evidence would clearly indicate animal origin. can't easily falsify possibilities. Step 2: reasonable possibilities? Among candidates, one answer terrific public policy implications, worth exploring.

Anyway, odd I-don't-trust-her Hong Kong whistleblower claims smoking gun lab-origin evidence release soon. We'll see, but, may case ""we'll never know one way other.""  I've plenty friends go chiro weekly (or even twice-weekly) basis chiro sells idea needs regular, ongoing thing. people injuries, regular people suffer mild back pain occasionally.

And every one would fewer problems need chiro good exercise program regularly.  Chiros temporarily put body back be, thing keeps good posture strong core I'm saying people New York Lombardy atleast chance seek medical treatment go get food necessities.

Locking people apartment/building draconian way contain spread virus. way say China prioritized people economy willing let people die horrible death covid/starvation/neglect people could return work sooner, really warped way make CCP look like 'care' citizens. Im’a go “naaah” too. Trump virus now, he’s polluted country idiocy. Funnily enough, second pneumothorax wasn’t painful first. suspect better skilled hospital staff compared first time lot nerve damage happened. 3 chest tubes span year wasn’t fun though. pandemic it’s crazy psychological game pain chest anxiety, post-surgery pain, Covid pop another lung. Medical advice pandemic ever changing, especially novel virus. be. 
People acting like deception sticking old, unproven beliefs deceptive open new developments? know I'd prefer. 
The CDC advice given early everybody wanted N95 mask short supply. I'm guessing saw happened toilet paper, so.... 200k dead... vibe live, swear people dead ass afraid without watching again....

""'Im saying people New York Lombardy atleast chance seek medical treatment go get food necessities."" agree you, mean concept germ theory around century zero excuse ignorant opposed people 1918 likely knew nothing little since doctors still wrapping heads around it. Microdosing Covid dataset people covid random sample population. samples overwhelming number older people pre-existing heart issues. either biased (intentionally not) made up. Interesting although unsurprising:

“While strong democracies slower initiate restrictive policies, likely follow policies nearby countries. Following lead others rather making decisions based specific situation country may led countries locking either early late. Conversely, countries follow easing restrictive policies reinitiate policies, may situation countries adopt epidemiologically suboptimal policies.”

——- unquote

This would also apply states within US. NY NJ CT RI lock down, rest country *at time*. could restricted travel NE, started public information campaign, focused getting ready wave reached them. 

This report saying democracies copy democracies without analysis whether conditions currently match elsewhere. 

Strikes lazy, buck-passing, seeking plausible deniability: “But Mom, *he* started it!!” 

I think better this. Apparently not. (small) cupboard house dedicated masks sanitiser (all bought carefully, one time, display full), likely qualifies hoard, wrong. time on, Federal Government keep millions spare monkeys ready emergencies secret underground facility desert Nevada.

Unknowingly keepers, radiation nuclear explosions Nevada desert, mutated monkeys gave intelligence. proceeded take facility form army.  criticizing Dr. Fauci, people? sub, less! 

He's done great job keeping coronavirus response apolitical possible. Sure, lot people hate him, hardly see reason to. yes, make mistakes every (all humans do), make worse. He's NATIONAL EXPERT god's sake! seem like strict mask mandates may solution pandemic. see long term issue? masks help thing never passed critical thinking test anyway. IIRC months ago identified half dozen different minor mutations different continents. Seems odd definition ""stable"" ? Whilst deserve form punishment, can't help think scale fine bit harsh. Sorry you’re right. AP terrible source, I’ll read buzzfeed like on. know checked regularly, making assumptions. believe would been.

And strangely enough, yes able coordinate food delivery people unable go out. know fact. might people's usual standards food delivered.

I believe China's government efficient, know personal experience inefficient be, mobilise emergences pretty damn good. helps huge standing army.  whole ""PPE"" shortage hospitals, remember?

That caused hoarding. caused sharp spike demand. Utmost hard national lockdown would one situations financial impact locking everything would genuinely dangerous virus itself. 

The infection rate currently 1-2% compared 45% March nowhere near initially unless things go catastrophically sideways. That’s 100% Gay    true. say one case snowbird heading early sick restrictions New England. couple 70s think place need Winter would Florida.   door welded shut. door opens inward, possible weld bar across it, likely building welded shut instead individual apartments.

Can read? can, would ignore this? Way young die.  upsetting think kids Mom.  Fucking ridiculous propaganda... far less prevalent people wearing masks social distancing. Nobody flu. happening, would far cases coronavirus flu. coronavirus yet. think back then, idea handle cases. somewhat know wrt caring people leads recovery vs death. Pray tell find n95 masks? reason used “ “. could well degenerate point people much aware it. 

What I’m trying tell even though seen rising number case scaled testing capacities impact yet seen hospital death count remain quite low comparison number cases diagnosed (19 yesterday). 

Sorry ideas well expressed - English isn’t main language tell :-) This! I've tried explain regards schools. saying ""switch HEPA filters"" thing. Wow, comment section vile lived North South Dakota would wanna live anymore? doubt people suffer long term damage COVID (As virus) think based proportion asymptomatic infections, risk slightly overstated 'millions' term bit exaggeration. Also, know full long term effects virus west six months? dont think people saying myth. along lines ""its really bad flu"" people terrible immune systems underlying disorders really main ones susceptible it. Meaning, try take care immune system stay inside one people instead closing economy. honestly everyone turned fucking PHD scientist knows everything know corona less year old. told grandmother adjustment could empty gallbladder prevent irritation inflammation. That’s something couldn’t convince full shit. fine, thinks gallbladder emptied - better let think doesn’t need vaccinated. Small victories. write book shit Chiro says debunk her. Yes, I'm hearing. control money, control go do, surprised next thing "" people leaving cities cameras are, moving rural areas surveillance , fires set purpose drive back towns"" true. dine occasionally outside restaurants keep that. think masks absolutely impact, hope theory true. I'm glad sick staying strong anti-maskers. many covid positives, especially 30, remain symptom-free duration infection. That's spreading fast. fact recent outbreaks universities across US, vast majority students testing positive asymptomatic. becomes deadly problem interact older, vulnerable ppl outside community. wife daughter haven’t sick. 

I thought it’d pretty lucky asymptomatic. Esp 6 month old. thought wearing face mask necessarily *protect* coronavirus, reduces spread. OP say anything boss conservative?? Ask Sweden. understand worry going concerts, logical ways work social distancing. I've seen car concerts example. think main thing now, though, getting government assistance. (and be) long, hard road music industry. Unfortunately, misinformation propaganda better infecting brain cells anything sufficient society stop virus infecting them. depend venue, different venues treating different levels care.
Won't catch spoons, nicer restaurant they've cleared 3/4 tables. I'll consider it. I'm worried going dentist despite assured they're careful. ""rise"" small amount cases basically deaths, ""second wave"" god's sakes. drops ""wave"". 

I'm saying mischaracterizing purpose anything. saying make seem inevitable really big outbreaks periodically that's simply case countries, Korea. Experts' predictions always mark far, necessarily bad news. eat local diner every weekend. places WONT SURVIVE keep closed.

If sub way, country would stay strict lockdown vaccine comes out. 

Unpopular opinion: probably keep vulnerable strict lockdown work herd immunity much ICUs handle. vaccines don’t shit wasted 9-12 months developing them? Organized religion cancer world Oh jail time judicious beatings get compliance rates right up. really? said line one... I’ve got go listen. well put! know what? That’s fine. long sort time look forward to, that’s fine. stay inside day air dangerous breathe idk even true. feels like it’s going keep getting worse. feel like I’m midst chain events end humanity. want wrong. copypasta like there's novel virus loose people spreading other.  Masks vaccine! barbaric?? 

the bit welding people apartments, kidnapping put got dragged ""camps"".

bare faced lie. contact case quarantined either home hotel - inconvenient boring inhumane.

again outright lie. plenty footage time citizens welded homes gun point, others inside camps medical attention running richest, powerful country world killing 200,000 citizens negligence might viewed little inhumane though.

how much paid write garbage?

edit: lol account history actually priceless; china, content account posted since inception karma farming/manipulation subs sub trying justify chinese government's obviously faked numbers. actual honest god shilling account wild, incredible. new hotspots outside Madrid, earlier one centered. virus making way around country, inevitably, like U.S. Brazil Italy. second wave. guess. 

1. commenter said: know victim (in case, Dad) know he's good person got bad luck they're happy help
2. Also I'm guessing community homogeneous? single race, they're background: farmer, somewhat religious, football stuff. can't stand see ""freebies"" going people think work it. think people (urban liberals) work it? Because:
3. media. profited YEARS pitting red blue, generates views, ratings, clicks, etc. starting backfire, although honestly can't tell realize backfires still enjoying it.  
I blame left right media this. right media blatant faking news, left media masterful ""bending"" truth disclosing entire picture. Maybe whole thing backfired rather they're planning along they're still continuing increase divide. lucky around Spanish flu. shot people refused wear masks social distance. propose iin meantime? Well agree there. Wonder bad laundry got Boris? happened young woman live Lancashire too, dad successful business it’ll like pocket change them. whole heartedly agree amount, you’re going knowingly go guidelines set government, risk multiple people process, prepared pay price!! 10 days =/= 2 weeks. long think take interview hire new person? 

What fuck talking $1000 go doctor? Cash price I've seen literally everywhere 50 100. 

You obviously idea real world works lmao. definitely know medical business. don’t agree listen non-teachers don’t work hard teachers complain incessantly them. Damn crazy liberals harassing Sandy Hook victims. /s

It's always conspiracy wingnuts. Time shift back facts, science, data, etc. magical thinking please. Link? Exactly! see kind comments saying close everything sake health us service workers want need work He's rich anyway - went £30k per year school.. Daddy sort out..   first part, European nations try. obvious see decline comparison uncontrolled outbreaks like Brazil, US India.

Well say unified. speaking contrast happened America comparison people make sub.

The local governments inside US tried varying degrees. federal government supposed handling national disasters absolutely nothing even impeded progress. decreasing set record 12k? 12k daily cases, it? None killed 200,000 6 months 8 months, whatever number want put it. barely anyone. big deal, goddamn ""wave"". 

Using try say waves mass cases deaths inevitable matter stupid best, lying fit agenda, likely. Best 25 bucks pat back. world needs better america. another commenter mentioned, three major holidays coming starting five days, need get lot shopping done then. Many US colleges subreddits, listen chatter dorm building floor new infections. swear lot comments come people claiming incredibly concerned staff reality give damn restaurant employees much need jobs survive. shows touch real life are.  reconsider life choices Yes, really time trying figure pay rent various bills support families I'd bet even server, social justice warrior reeeing wind.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well beer company come say didn’t create people read taht believed it, I’m surprised one knew would reason, yes. stamina used be. I'm pretty good shape running tough lately. weeks ago thought really bad allergies, I'm guessing that's it. assumed allergies cough wet dry like typical Covid cough. main issue unaffordable. Like... people think bottom 99% spare £10,000 disposable income. That's around $12,794.99 USD American money.

The actual crime fit punishment either. Yes may global pandemic levels government set fines excessively harsh. also worth considering people charge Eton educated toffs incredibly warped view country upper class ivory tower.

This kid deserve 10K fine Britain's youth deserve vilified made example British government's inconsistent-as-fuck coronavirus guidelines. also worth mentioning six months ago, Boris Johnson want lockdown instead insisted let virus pass population sake ""herd immunity"" pipe dream. **His inaction reason Britain currently highest death toll Europe.**

Given fact confirmed cases bad Britain mid March, still locked country back down, think that's Boris wants do.

The worst part kid likely ***fucked*** life now. likely dragged courts inability cough ten grand, end fine negatively impacting credit rating rest life. fuck teenager's life something like this. America simply care refugees asylum seekers. US politician publicly advocate testing non-Americans everyday Americans cannot get tests? I’m Wisconsin today one gives damn either. I’m east side St. Paul metro. Sad. According article ~$29,000/200 = $145 per death  colleges enablers, knew exactly going happen, chose money people dying. Nothing ""cherry pick"" make difference.

Corrected you, right? 

If **true majority** people said anything brother called ""A fraud, spreader false propaganda, liar, Russian operative *and* dangerous radical"", delete comment. 

If small proportion people said things like this, chose worst cases, (by definition) look bbc UK Twitter. 
60% comment every coronavirus post says doesn’t exist slippery too! Put grit don’t fall, substitute scotch water. Oregon whole dumpster fire pandemic, several months people demonstrating France wearing yellow safety jackets sign recognition. first changes government wanted make, help Facebook socials quickly transformed demonstration everything (French people turned demonstrating science).

Anyway, people blocked roads, camped roundabouts, sometimes aggressive people wanting go work join them.

In US would supremacists kind similar mob. France mentality minus guns racism. least that's opinion, others might differ (I'm need were).

To sum up, people ready throw revolution stupid reasons, putting danger try reasonable, need go work willing change world voting instead burning down. really. try keep head focused work, limit exposure world, keep fingers crossed one vaccines works out. 

Also, lot promising reports coming say wearing mask greatly reduce viral load lessen symptoms, potentially leading immunity. I'll keep best family hope works out. understand is: think virus big liberal lie, account fact world? actually think worldwide scam? surprising, southern il give flying fuck. schools reopened, ppl going bars pub crawls, still tons weddings masks. sister worked nursing home started highschool again, quit even ppe terrified getting residents sick. still high schoolers work :( would think rural areas would afraid many small hospitals icu beds. one deadliest pathogens long shot. H1N1, AIDS, polio, Ebola, SARS, MERS, small pox deadlier past 100 years. guess look stats Midwest steady number .  Would call flattening curve ?  Sure high regions Spike 200s 300s..  point can’t stop don’t spikes overwhelm hospitals right? talking geometry? fuck respectability politics. believe saw video yesterday guy blew vapor smoke nose mouth wearing many different masks(cloth, surgical,etc) vapor went every mask wether sides directly could manage dozen entitled hosted party within guidelines people showed uninvited whole lot left st point. Yes, entire world waiting American election go back normal. That’s double teacher makes South. It’s even comparable. Every teacher know three jobs.  Many people know second jobs restaurants also worked. Server here. Never got unemployment despite best efforts. clear wasn’t getting unemployment, got job grocery store quarantine. restaurant reopened, ran back. need money. don’t blame anyone coming restaurants. Yes it’s selfish move, United States created.

Edit: didn’t get stimulus check either student Check France Uk numbers. problem similar. bartend cash dive bar loosely follows rules. far I'm ok. totally guilty this. completely unconscious thing, loud area, ear plugs make point something. lowered mask basically yelled 3 people could hear me. finished realised mistake said sorry working with. laughed talk type mistakes every morning part top mind awareness. Nice you’ll probably get buccaneers game know caught work? Right! soo hard wear mask long shifts customers eating drinking merry! would piss watch them! That’s like saying “I don’t think it’s fair use people nursing homes going die soon anyways, anything would killed them, pandemic not”. said late 2021 new hope outlook somehow changes I'm pretty sure cloth mask filter smoke well N95. Neither actually designed smoke though. 

But smoke thick enough low ground areas issue. Really mostly smoke obscuring sky bay. Yesterday smelled bit like fire first time week two way.  Retired therapist here: agree people advocated leaving.

Its case quitting quitting him. want call tell quitting would allow maybe come therapeutic response. would count maybe time self reflect words. recommend closing sessions patients benefit complains insists seeing person would simply hang him. areas, therapists using zoom skype see clients. 

Also would fill many online surveys could find warn possible patients. Complaining reddit helpful.

Good luck hope get help need shown utilize critical thinking. Spoiler alert: not. old conspiracy theory spread people time time. look closer makes fucking sense (statistically example, timewise too, match antibody test results, mention confirmed reinfections mild, go deeper even things make sense hypothesis). Whaaaaa say? suggest do? This. I've kept dining room closed want staff deal types people. thing is...

*""Reputable conservative right wing Christian news sources""* (direct quote) telling grandparents CDC published *""fluffed numbers""* *""lied everyone virus dangerous""* attempt *""blame Trump right election""*...

So people study totally disregard results source. shit? Doctors desirable profession.

Somehow america labelled medical insurance salesmen desirable. Even though share similar views, ypur premise incorrect. increased number people makes conspiracy difficult maintain, done history, effective scale.

MK Ultra conspiracy solid amount CIA government complicit abduction mental torture weak individuals. Moreso, entered several wars served nonsensicaö haöf truths motivation.

Fact want run conspiracy, need handful individuals highest level political economic power band together, agree course action lie obfuscates true motivations. Cartels create unspoken monopolies operate like example. Conspiring possible competition. Quercetin, vitamin d3, resveratrol, green tea. Good luck. 

Also alpha lipoic acid co q10.

I take these. They're harmless help! Backed science lazy cite references. Google ""quercetin ncbi"" etc dont agree you. third world country. similar things happen rest european countries think happen Spain. E.g. parties lot people without masks, masks buyed china bad, politicians saying stupid things interested power, protest marchs againts masks, people robbing big amounts masks, problems un economy due social distance... sadly happens worldwide. Teachers never said they’re essential. They’ve said jobs remotely, safer themselves, children, everyone children spread disease to. difficult understand? many nurses, bus drivers, Uber, policemen, Target employees, garbage men, actors, professionals, waitresses, truck drivers died? get break profession (deaths per 100k) see significant?  Facebook twitter aren’t unique United States, I’ll grant point Donald cases means virus come around get older ones sick ones pretty easy means deaths start rise sooner later can't see scenario could POSSIBLY go wrong. yeah well waiter dress like bee keeper serve may universe telling learn cook.... Delusional thinking seldom completely harmless, always potential hurt people. France tests 1 million per week, equivalent 4.6 million States side. Numbers comparable  haven’t yet, we’re considering going outdoor beer garden pop recently opened city. It’s outdoors tables spaced 6 feet apart reservations deposit required. It’s something we’d regularly, getting married small (a immediate family only) courthouse ceremony would nice go celebrate safe way. There’s thing 0 risk think it’s pretty low risk.

Just one time deal it’s hosted brewery I’ve heard following strict county regulations dining consistently often going beyond. It’s admit virus actually real fucking terrifying can’t bring it. bigger pride - pure, existential fear.

I don’t pity them. pity people spread to, frankly I’m glad disease targets narcissists sociopaths. Good riddance. water wet. anyone think people going restaurants would actually help ease pandemic?  today 13 Sep:

Announced: 515

Actual reported: 1838

This lag - intentionally announcing lower numbers reported. guess need massage curve keep back-to-school plans alive. can’t imagine anything gaslight-y trusted therapist berate beliefs try use mental illness you. hope see fact became angry proves abuse coming logical place. fall prey prejudices way another, matter educated professional are. I’m trying excuse behaviour, it’s ridiculous unprofessional importantly therapeutic. berating someone mental health ever worked?

I know personally, would find really hard doubt shoes. wanted point therapist speaking health professional (or would understood science!) fear/anger/denial/whatever. ""Balancing return""

Their vaccine costs $100 per dose (it's cheap cultivate virus- 1st candidate inactivated live virus). nice way saying expensive vaccinate everyone. Still responsible people. wrong country?

Facebook, Twitter, Orange Twat? 

What win? everything open, can't know actually caused it

*Taps side head* said significant portion, people hospitalized due COVID significant portion.  Great Influenza John Barry, hypothesize 1918 flu could led numbers increased deaths following years side effects survivors, appear studied great depth. today 13 Sep:

Announced: 515

Actual reported: 1838

This lag - intentionally announcing lower numbers reported. guess need massage curve keep back-to-school plans alive. Slippery slope fallacy. Thank mean, 2021 like 3.5 months away. never expecting normality come time. Leaving obviously underreported fatality rates aside.Death reason elderly risk,various complications Corona including limited Acute Respiratory Failure,Pneumonia,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),fibrosis etc etc(there's really long list) also arise.

Many corona-related deaths often ruled one following complications(with common one flu) completely dismissed(I personally experienced it) non-corona related death.

My original point debunk fact India thinks safe virus since population mostly young.But clearly went head.  Mask!

No Pants!

Freedom!  recommending stay-at-home strategy travel ban? would work? people watching China news like since December would know Masks wearing important! didn’t listen Fauci, February one wearing mask city buying essentials getting dirty looks. watching news China experienced would next. can’t believe many people trust government! crazy mean... call British Donald Trump United States. Although possibly bad.  Genuinely gov could slapped Cummings fine, said he's law, done press conference etc public would happy hell. 

Instead constantly say wrong done yet fine other, normal people breaking rules.   Marriage always frought issues usually married honeymoon spouses tend thing, couples differences start show.

Not wanna marry someone exactly like myself, keep thing long enough turn “out sight mind” thing point couple gets forced back others lives extent disturbs enough cause divorce, worst.

Aint love grand? It’s little complicated that. It’s people afraid Covid climate change. It’s they’ve invested whole life believing certain “side” right everything. fear confronting entire belief structure wrong. can’t house cards would collapse. Right time cold weather people huddling together indoors! \o/ Proven policies exist solve restaurants permanently shutter people kept safe. policies initiated state federal authorities. policies involve government financial support pivot operations owners, financial support employees affected pivots, paid government employers. 

Stop pretending nothing done, we're Americans goodness sake decide something, it. landed moon first, mobilized two world wars, dragged great depression federally led policies. Government works, elected leadership makes work. It’s relatively easy understand. change guidance wearing mask June (!).  

So basically first 3-4 months lead medical professionals US government main medical organization world (WHO) recommend masks

Crazy. partner you. know felt like going insane push back got people preparing. Even skeptical couple weeks (around beginning February). soon hit Italy getting real information, board. stopped talking acquaintances friends it. started wearing mask accepted dirty looks. think people didn’t want accept lives could upended like this. think I'm going excerpt Trump saying dangerous COVID play back phone encounter assholes, maybe followed saying ""suckers"" / ""losers"". cognitive dissonance confronted deeply frustrating profound. Yep. one can't understand taking mask indoors presence others hour time could possibly create additional opportunities get sick. one years comprehend issue wearing masks.

LOL. good one. still anti-vaxxer's. there's going anti-maskers years. wait years passed start openly talking dumb right never wearing one. much responsibility this. many people dont feed kids, etc. best take I've seen yet. Keep going. Thanks setting example! Read posted yesterday Covid-19 sub: sound like you’re experiencing? Cloth masks problem, one helps wildfire smoke definitely is. think health economy priority. People around travelling, weddings, sorts risky things.  think could better balance. Health important, jobs. mean two things unrelated, mentioning irrelevant point. person's actions warrant fine.  Darwinism right? Dear people Dublin, could please stay need another lockdown, would great! 

Dear people Germany: parents could dissuaded vacation, please stay away elderly people hiking trips Moselle region. Yeah, noticed cases starting creep back. CDC says every one case detected, likely 10 silent cases. there's building community spread going right now, also thinking could see exponential growth month. thoughts Sturgis rally push? Punish harshly? Yes. ""Or forget it""? That's fucking stupid.

The thing whataboutism understand: Multiple things wrong time, best (but often impossible short term) something them, worse still good much many possible, worst option nothing them. Many parents know choosing send kids person told expect school get shut soon, hope kids get weeks normalcy happens. trouble understanding logic. eldest son asthma. gets it...I don’t want think possibilities could happen. 

But hey don’t let personal story almost 200k bodies tell otherwise. 

Stay safe social distance. buy bullshit 'conserving"" PPE early on. Osterholm kept pointing studies cast doubt efficacy masks ignoring data far east suggested helped stop spread airborne illness tremendously. high profile scientist doubt usefulness masks stopping spread.

Then doubted clear day evidence came early contact traced outbreak studies virus airborne, aerosolized. doubted asymptomatic spread. 

The problem saying, ""Well we're 100% certain yet,"" problem saying ""we know take simple steps MIGHT curb spread evidence keep calling ""inconclusive"" ""circumstantial"" might evidence things actually work and/or happening"". Cause that's went U.S. MONTHS. took consortium long ignored aerosol scientists finally push back set public facing scientific statements track cared saving lives accumulation efficacy multiple measures rather ""being right"" ""causing panic"" ""giving false positives"". Cause false positives LEAST problems could fixed quickly fucked many ways.

I believe Fauci many American scientists believed superiority American science studies really think masks worked. did, would gotten front stories like which, everyone else know collective amnesia, news happening country.

How conserving masks let people use ones already own? got sick died, many did, allowed even use PPE, guess someone else find masks going belongings use them? 

Yeah, got nothing... Rounding corner? 

Give us credit Fauci, least people wearing masks seem positive effect. means 50% chance one other. Either successfully immunized not.

No, not. That's immunity works. sliding scale, binary. record, 50-60% efficacy middling year flu vaccine, still get it. Why? Even still get flu, lessens severity duration symptoms. theory behind makes sense, hard believe  talk eating restaurant point. know people refuse believe restaurants places easily caught. _seen_ people eat? People chew mouths open, talk food mouths, they're using utensils drinking glasses leaving saliva things, they're leaving covid infested table behind leave. waiter busser comes deal it, clear plates spritz cleaner hopefully single use rag/paper towel. disinfect chairs? floor around table? long dishes sit dishwasher counter top they're washed? cook get anywhere near anything? cook sick? waiter? give crap position tables 6' apart, that's issue restaurants. People hear ""it's foodborne"" get eating, act eating, full things spread it.  links studies, keywords likely bring up? can't find justifications seemed reasonable me, I'd love read studies point that's case. feel like twitter worse helping kind stuff spread that’s saying much. I’m also biased don’t use twitter Facebook feed cat groups Hollywood gives shit people making decision. want money. I'm I'm gonna say stupid thinking saying people colour rioting racist legit people colour rioting people colour lives matter moment.  IQ test. version low score wins like golf. prize Darwin award. agree, anecdotally couples know addition single friend decided great time IVF. I'm stunned...  Quite bluntly, way learn responsible adult held accountable actions.

This someone went something stupid, immediately _realized_ something stupid showed regret.

They planned party, invited people, rethink actions people started showing up.

Their response Community Protection Officers showed 'well, shit, alright, party's over', _hostility_.

This case failing consider others first. case failing follow COVID-19 orders.

This case clearly deciding law apply them, outright hostile response someone trying shut let enough.

So yes, serious consequences _are_ called for. making mistake going party, throwing party, deciding rules matter authorities showed up. Pretend like someone else’s s*** hands blood mask. Don’t friggin touch you’re ready wash hands mask ready go wash. Thanks correction. meant voters split two major parties, totally right. Adrenaline unnecessary risk taking? Fair analogy, bungee jumping sky diving present risk others around you. I'm worried about. people hug pay price. Cool google search.

That's literally 100% opposite said. weird attitude best pay gives best results, corporate executives. kind reasoning gets totally forgotten conversation shifts things like teacher pay. conversation paying less expecting results decline. answer question, yes, like sane person I’m completely okay “clearing deadwood approach.” Also known approach ever applied pandemic human history. fact, alternative “everybody hide homes don’t come years create vaccine miraculously goes away own” approach never even CONSIDERED prior pandemic COVID (including pandemics WAY deadly). It’s fucking stupid anyone publicly advocating “strategy” immediately committed. find characterization extremely flawed offensive. “The downside lost grandparents.” Umm no, many grandparents 60 healthy fine. actually looked data would know COVID really kicks 75-80 demographic, specifically already way dying something else. Good riddance them. know 80 nursing home suffering ailment would much rather COVID take things drawn out. 1 google search...

You're essentially saying way make leave I'm lease not. think backwards. can't make leave we're lease.

I’m talking athletes. we're talking social constructs, biology. People need accept viable/realistic option... governments have. Teaching online 2 times work pay. see burn high. saw interview director head studio Russel Crowle movie. tried act like movie worth going theaters for. don't... Person well. unemployment run out. happens, you’re done. depressing life must be, judgmental  Weddings funerals permitted, whole bunch restrictions (numbers, social distancing, masks, etc.). Graduations online year. Life bottoms sometimes. Mine several times. always rebuild. long shelter, food, access medical care, wait start again. 

It may take while. really bad one. want catch thing organ damage brain damage. also lost job company downsize I'm job pays 1/4 used make. sucks, hard, war (economic health wise). know right ask people go acting like everything normal even though could get sick die, could save company job. get it. get also. suspect quite bit younger (I'm middle aged). future possibly grim. Look now, throwing tantrum get way. 

You got WOOSHED lol one fully knows long term long term effects far identified

If know long term effects, possibly identified long term effects?

And yet people wonder nobody takes subreddit seriously anymore... Nothing Sturgis incompetent governorships. Nothing see here. Move on. Yep....... matter ""being smug"". guys need get clue card, wearing mask public would good one. Germany. working. know countries multiple local lockdowns already suspected Israel first second country-wide lockdown. Israel big country guess hard impose matters would Brazil US. last thing guy needs mortgage. happens lock again? It’s happening countries may forced follow. yeah, places hiring, you’re competing tens millions unemployed people desperate work. Testing UK generally done doctors. Wrong continent, dear. Nobody cares scares someone would consider going grocery store exposure. really looked like freedom customize character showed e3. find there's basically two classes can't customise?! added many symptoms Covid, even bad night drinking home alone would click symptoms. illegal specific limited way. everybody tested positive. party, people knew tested positive. everyone already infected.  Came looking right way! totally agree this! listen, pay! awesome😷👍🏻 consider someone fully grown then?  Cases also rising UK Cries 2.2T USD Sell pig now. excuse guys actions. goddamn toddler, adult.  I'm trip Soi Cowboy Walking Street one thing drive hour game, another fly half way around world. fined would admitting wrong, admitted wrong would fire neither.  and? could kicked property party all. national plan still ignore it? worse kids imo.I've WFH since March, I'll quit going back high risk situation (my wife's immuno compromised). make call (I understand many adults luxury though). kid, parents school say go back, fucked. Imagine spreading grandparents ending lasting organ damage someone forced go back want to. That's got breed serious resentment. least fuck catch it, me. 🤣🤣🤣I also working elon musk. nothing wrong unemployed future boomer. get UBI. Social constructs aren’t representative biological reality r/JusticeServed don’t care kids feel. care getting kids away like parent evening weekends. rest kids awake time schools problem. Oh forgot live Happy rainbow self determination land. Scary part is, could standing front denier telling story they'll inclined believe he's paid actor tell truth. consequences her? Nothing. Absolutely zero. Humans everywhere, see consequences actions, knowingly harm others care all.

Don't worry. knowingly willingly broke law. Germany law. tried pay it. particular felony get 5 years prison, though, US citizen likely get fine. Also, grass green we’re middle pandemic. time survival point. keep getting increasingly better treatments understanding helps prevent serious consequences

Thousands people going die.  showing big brains here. Could've listed **country** 🤦🏼‍♂️ there's resources devoted making happen US. big guy top, influences spread throughout world. 

If similar firehouse directed country 20+ years results would similar. smug, everyone needs figure beat this. sure around Harrington seen street one claimed that. accurately pointed using wrong terms pisses became disgusting insulting asshole deal inadequacy. *hack hack hack* USA! USA! USA! *cough choke* fuck compares someone possibly spreading dangerous virus? Yeah almost like playing importance cotton masks might help truth spread instead making fun right. mean might helped cancer patients actually stay safe. see anything endangered lives everyone else sentimental, alright, gets misty-eyed glorious opportunity spreading!

Then, many years later, sitting retirement home, reminiscing, it'll like ""Yeah, gatherings? Good times..."". Dude it’s September..we can’t live fear forever welcome to. means it’s one ""pro lifers"" hear much about? aware different kinds average: mean, mode, median, range... he’s idiot. age, know what’s right wrong. Must tell obvious joke. Must not. Big true Yeah, groups need drop political angle protest fact non-political protests deemed acceptable pandemic. falling, falling hard thanks fat, traitorous scumbag office right now

I'm sorry rain parade self-flagellation, US falling least 30 years. Trump symptom cultural political decay. One, unfortunately, accelerated even further. Oh ok sorry   addition to, too, additionally, likewise Spain, France, UK seeing cases rise due 2nd wave thinking safe virus.

A country needs long lockdown get virus control.

It U.S. government dumb idea people unemployment, letting companies go under, financial safety net people supposed working. German Boxing Federation Sunday reported ""large part"" 25-strong Tokyo Olympic Games team contracted Covid-19 training Austrian Alps can't carry economy. 

But rich, hold tank many small businesses. people become scared really economy. 

But hand, prolong pandemic ineffectively social distancing masking. Sure young people die india places, much agree on, enough even remotely compensate extreme differences demographics. whole point.

You seem understand age dependent Covid mortality rates are. We're talking 1000 times deadly elderly young people. Even young people die twice often india west come close compensating fact less 1% india's population western countries Anecdotal, I’m teaching person classes sizes 20. Everyone wears masks time we’ve two symptomatic cases 6 weeks school, none know past 3 weeks. doubt actually spreading ton we’d symptoms. Sounds positive! Sounds awful lot like political climate Brazil. coincidence fucking Steve Bannon involved situations. Everyone even shred authority subject unanimously stated letting virus infect everyone horrible idea disastrous consequences. ones pushing idea herd immunity corrupt politicians billionaires pandemic hurting bottom line. one restaurant.


Got it. multiple hot spots sad state we're in. People would rather die hurt others inconvenienced. may say so, exactly liberties lost. give away voluntarily. virus spread thing matters whether NHS overwhelmed. pretty clear going be. five deaths reported 11-12 September 67 serious underlying health conditions. Yes, that's sad major great scheme things. rediscovered love cooking, days want someone else cooking (especially) cleaning. Curbside pickup works fine me. data shows children good carriers infect others

There really, really decent evidence this, lot spread it. really flawed contract tracing studies many months ago got people thinking children good spreading it, they've basically debunked point.

Basically, represents wishful thinking. could provide decent evidence kids spreaders like adults, I'd like see it. One question mind. know headaches fairly constant coming intermittently four days? Also, know location headache would interesting, worries know.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Florida. Disturbing. administration utterly inept every way possible. discharge criminal penalty bankruptcy? Sorry, Jesus isn’t right now. Leave message internal screaming void. remember episodes star trek loath give developing societies access federation technologies advanced enough handle appropriately. feel like that's situation us social media. technology society culture advanced enough use without destroying ourselves. always though it'd laser weapons something, fucking social media site. imagine suddenly access actual alien advanced technology? Yikes. evil necessary? probably reply would love see try justify wrote. also wrong vegans pro-vaxx, that's different issue safe them, unlikely kill effects noticeable period year.

And criteria would zero community transmission vaccine developed deployed. Trust do. love job though family. really think it’ll soon? He's 100% masks. Apologies double negative. simply made point idea mask wearing could conveying mask-wearer level immunity based inoculating folks beneficial level viral load dubious best. And, thought dangerous could lead folks potentially reckless behavior. I'd recommend listening recent episode. believe addresses may missing bit nuance. If, hypothesis, theories tests literally plenty studies prove cold\\bad weather increases viral spread due things people staying indoors more. Viruses also last lot longer dry cold air, meat packing plants hard hit. Please stop spreading misinformation. Oh do. People die AIDS. die random infection depleted immune system can't fight off.  one talking ‘indefinitely”. Sooner later pandemic people party much want. think problem asymptomatic, way define is, never symptom testing positive, either viral load testing anti-body testing. 

Pre-symptomatic transmission symptomatic transmission main routes proven today lead symptomatic cases. problem know pre-symptoms asymptomatic. So, initial pre-symptom window difficult deal person know appear way predict symptoms. 

People never show symptom, reason tested, generally speaking. So, CDC little confirmable/reliable contact tracing data asymptomatic cases leading symptomatic cases...

More importantly, opinion cases bad. keep using ""cases"" metric ""how doing"". ""know"" asymptomatic cases lead cases death near zero, could good vaccine. realize sentence stated data based date, hypothesis mine. based declining case fatality rate, along current mortality rates age groups 50... seem worse anything else there. 

Anecdotally, mother law 7 others nursing home tested positive asymptomatic quarantined 14 days. reason tested one nurses, wearing proper PPE, contact symptomatic person, nurse, positive, also asymptomatic. Based contact tracing, nurse 8 others presumably caught nurse asymptomatic tested negative roughly 2-3 weeks afterwards. nursing home told us 9 people quarantined, monitored appear fine. Also, nurse came contact ~40 residents floor. 

To me, get kids (all ages) back school, wearing masks, study suggests build immunity low viral load transmission. suggestion would use daily temperature checks go/no-go. Use Universities ""bubbles"". Again, age group shown resilient wear masks, maybe build immunity. 

Of course details need worked missing need plan move forward. Something sensible, risks, hopefully low something silly wait see approach. Hopefully vaccine ready middle/end 2021 get 50+ maybe importantly 65+ vaccinated get back out. vulnerable group 65+, probably need play extra safe still.

This debate think problem people following simple guidelines end game defined. What's plan Fauci? develop plan escape planet search one instead building spaceship, accidentally construct time machine, sending back 1947 Roswell... Monkey problems? monkey problems. Well sure, since care covid. test, could possible keep countries report real numbers. Since testing lying numbers. War covid won. Damn hate time line. retesting order applied people negative results fever, coughing shortness breath, developed COVID-19 symptoms within three days negative test results.

Close 100,00 re-tested exhibited symptoms. there's even higher number asymptomatic carriers tested negative currently walking around infected infecting. Ok, link then. maybe ""you knew"" backed studies yet.  Really good point. think he's trying anything. neural pathway ritalin sudafed addled brain stays stable long. think says stuff. 

It's like Drain Swamp Fake News, thing said Quebec Territories included study, though seperate study showed 2.23% positivity Quebec donors. used think lived in, like, good community. collectively decided positioning party town college kids important families live here. Sad. lot us don’t like vast minority. nobody would even wear masks.  things non-essential that's way looking life. note nobody ever taken attitude towards infectious diseases. many times anyone tell young people socialise might pass infection could infect someone vulnerable?  Meanwhile india vibing daily 90k cases literally public buses filled completely Problem one really saying otherwise.

Plenty saying everywhere like Sweden economy would badly off. leaves punches big hole argument demonstrates majority economic downturn attributable lockdowns.

He's making qualitative argument quantitative argument. problem people like line reasoning take specific numbers say support point, ignoring everything else number. number say think says, numbers, qualitative facts important.

The reality anything else requires enormous burden proof met. Past pandemics globalisation, widespread air travel, DJT polarisation mask issue. Maybe alternate universe DJT told everyone wear MAGA masks opened economy well. didn't. alone can’t carry economy, look Disney, look airplanes. Conservative playgrounds might busy, that’s going last.

I’m saving absurd amount money now, that’s norm.

Make safe kids kids money comes back economy.  made critical failure early saying masks work, instead declared effective could return normal wore them. mention also myocardial inflammation baseline measurements well. appearing like something quite common, started looking starting see common actually is.

See commentary numerous cardiologists Prof. Darrel Francis (Imperial College London) screaming now.  India 95k daily cases. According article ""The 27 countries European Union plus U.K., Norway, Iceland Liechtenstein recorded 27,233 new cases Wednesday"". Anecdote time: grandfather showed clip ""amazing pilot"" landing plane one wing wing fell midflight. obviously video rv airplane spliced similar looking real plane take off. pointed out, grandfather even process fact real. Look it. right there. Proof internet. ""No, that's skilled pilot."" Harmless instance, see credulity leads. know? Maybe real vaccine masks wore along way. masks preventing massive uptick France? suffering result letting feel-good ignorance anti-intellectualism fueled healthy dose xenophobic populism run rampant, usual. mean ""we knew"", mean early on, March?    
You need evidence make claims, ""I know"" good enough.  
 earliest know evidence think iceland study cruise ship study around March, even showed amount people asymptomatic, many people spread virus symptoms. Fake news. numbers much higher.  Fuck em!. literally. keep wearing mask. Ohhhh nooooo fewer cases ever before! getting this?!? U.S. averaging thousand COVID-19 deaths day. people die COVID-19 week died 9/11 attacks. Please stop spreading misinformation. That's many people died young, skewing average. 

The post replied load nonsense though. wasn’t him. pretty much every voice authority time. 8% India's population taxed. idea talking about. putting American context without knowing true capabilities Government India. job two years assess capabilities Government India. summarize abundance reports wrote subject...they good. randomized study, results may artificially high (people symptoms probably likely enroll, even disclose results), may artificially low (people choose participate scientific studies may likely average adhere mask guidelines. results would accurate, still interesting comparison perspective. World War 2 generation wouldn’t done shit stupid. Maybe trump right fucking losers.  evil party. need get grip using language like that.  come family teachers assumed would also teacher. basically sat college intervention telling choose education career. Looking back thankful that, yet also dismayed right. Nonsense. proof masks anything outdoors. still case wear mask around chin right? side note, fuck people wear masks around chins? think would uncomfortable wearing mask. imagine building infrastructure today involves much higher degree labor skill century ago. Tell something that's obvious./s viral inoculum matters determining severity SARS-CoV-2 infection, additional hypothesized reason wearing facial masks would reduce viral inoculum wearer exposed subsequent clinical impact disease. Since masks filter virus-containing droplets (with filtering capacity determined mask type),2 masking might reduce inoculum exposed person inhales. theory bears out, population-wide masking, type mask increases acceptability adherence,2 might contribute increasing proportion SARS-CoV-2 infections asymptomatic. typical rate asymptomatic infection SARS-CoV-2 estimated 40% CDC mid-July, asymptomatic infection rates reported higher 80% settings universal facial masking, provides observational evidence hypothesis. Countries adopted population-wide masking fared better terms rates severe Covid-related illnesses death, which, environments limited testing, suggests shift symptomatic asymptomatic infections. Thank understanding me, feel like people hard us high risk. I’m someone literally try harass right post almost like shame high risk. That’s interesting statistic high risk safety hadn’t heard before! worries many people throw precautions soon vaccine exists combined large anti-vax movement. know isolating better alternative, it’s putting major halt life plans looking even really frustrating see city partying like normal every day. trying get best can. Increased time front screen blue light prevents melatoninw helps sleep. Naturally working home causes increased screen time several ways. sleep difficult.

Also depression plain boredom decreased social interactions variety activities makes harder *do* anything sounds like start really good sci-fi story. still law heavily restricts socialising. So, think it'll safe hold parties? criteria must met? certainly safe them. It’s sweet tasty not? You’re missing out. Sorry boring self 🤷🏻‍♀️ single person living relatives problem Americans selfish fucks thanks culture hyper-individualism. Asking people let healthcare frontline workers get masks first would done nothing. Water Wet: CDC Study I'm really around people stuff leave mask time. take off, I'll lose forget remember halfway parking lot. course much worse, general expectation 2nd check workers get get phase-out fed unemployment bonus. PPP funding 95% business small business country, funding state/local, plus/minus optional things. are, 2nd check, unemployment bonus check run out, expectaitons way reality. “I can’t believe you’ve done this!” world going shit matter colour humans trash.

But yes I'm racist. seeing black people riots black lives matters movement noticing police anything makes raciest lmao I'm surprised America seemed real bad right now.. we're real bad. smh That’s hearing, part servers serving people indoors serving sort people think eating indoors pandemic good idea... God damn sir madam, beat it! upvote. personally require ""them"" wear mask, ""they"" don't, I'm going.

Neither parents. Get used it. Deserved  lump ani-vaxxers this? question mine time. new disease. vaccines it, vaccine say 'no,' to. Even people believe vaccines hesitant get available safety concerns. 30-60%, depending survey look at, saying people want this. anti-vaxxers 'ruining' chances heard immunity. explain please? Truly wondering.  sorry loss. Former HS English teacher, here; left end 18-19 school year. work B2B tech sales making money even 30+ year salary former district's pay schedule teachers bachelor's degree (base only, including commission). I've year currently junior/developmental role...once book business next 6-18 months, earning potential goes roof. Sometimes colleagues role bemoan job hard stressful, bite tongue. Compared teaching, job breeze. laughable.

It helped internal recommendation program friend already working company. worth, though, skills included resume: presentation design delivery; written composition editing; creative, strategic problem-solving; prioritize multiple projects deadlines; foster maintain relationships; flexible self-starter, quick learner; branding client experience care (I degrees Advertising English).

Besides money work/life balance improvements, mental health positive feel like different person. benefits comprehensive actually called benefits advisor make sure reading right. get tired sales, moving laterally elsewhere company entirely possible. expense work-related costs company (used spend hundreds dollars every year teacher). I'm thoroughly enjoying learning whole new industry, teaching skills apply countless ways.

It makes sad, tbh. absolutely *loved* teaching, best moments. becoming fewer every year. submitted resume current job, cried. forever champion teachers, future child's teachers spoiled rotten supplies appreciation gifts I'm going buy them. anymore. destroying me. Leaving best professional decision ever made, even though broke heart. long distance ""scrupulously cautious"" ""batshit"". Drawing line one stretch.  We're used it. course, prefer warm, Canada.

You grow it. happened open, might help - [CDC planning scenarios, updated Sept 10, current estimated IFRs age ever lived UK? have. amazing. system taxes absolutely insane. luxury goods tax, 20% VAT tax, door knob tax, average speed camera traps automatically mail speeding tickets reading licences plate calculating known distance traveled time cameras. 

They TV tax pay tax collectors go door door radio signal detectors threaten people pay detect TV home. 

I lived there. insane! happy fuck squeeze every penny working class people. yes, intend using COVID excuse squeeze every pence people. teen fucked up. agree. draconian. fine Roma broke garage stole shit HALF much! going coffers. was, would added zeros.

Edit: lol, second call brits insane CCTV Tax state start downvoting you. Excessive taxation burden backs people. makes sense, gyms live require whole time. don’t blame you. Imagine throwing house party global pandemic

I make happen even pandemic Collision sport
Absolutely insane player COVID asymptomatic Even easier police already door. It’s freezing Canada wintertime though. Tough seniors. Lol, actually quite hilarious me. “I want lock down...going lockdown would put street.” You’ve effectively brainwashed literally advocating making homeless avoid exposure disease far less 1% chance killing you. Think second. let guess, sooner still mid-to late March, right? police show end party, don’t want people there, response would be, “yes! want break up!” not, “piss off! we’re party here!” argument doesn’t hold water. chose consequences. Among Virginia schools, James Madison one top party schools. also reputation highest STD rate lol. Doesn’t surprise bad there. Even treatments things say infection long term effect heart, brain, lungs, unless completely eliminates infection, going problem. also. especially won’t care vaccine. people saying wait years vaccine also. Enough. People free shelter place home however long way. Human traffickers, probably.

I would *hope* scrutinised welfare charitable agency, though.

Edit: horrifying.

Who handed to? really better gassing them?  need wear mask long mask good enough. deffinetly it. education system need inovative people like Visited PEI 2 years ago 10-year break. many things changed people still nice everybody! one partaking whataboutism. 

It Government's job tell go restaurant eat. personal risk assessment + whether value quality life quantity life. 

As long follow city's policies regarding mask usage social distance, go restaurant, movie theatre, school, etc... I’ve heard lot need back school someone take care cannot go back mental space spring it’s good mental health.

And I’m ..........
If home safe healthy kids safe healthy makes mental, fuck? I’m saying it’s easy non stop risk health everyone else’s don’t parent jfc.
And clear stay home parents crowd can’t work home truly need someone else watch them. greed. authorities much tolerant things announced ahead time. I’ve eaten outdoors handful times places known taking seriously enjoyed myself. said eating indoors vaccine, live cold climate outdoor dining won’t able option soon. given opportunity end party without *any* fine. chose fine. wear masks, apply disctancing, yeah, charge same. respect this, starved social interactions. isolated everyone around them. could easily hung 3 closest friends well within guidelines. ... medical facilities catering seniors FL AZ.

Oh boy. Canadian Snowbirds depend American medical system all, universal social back home.

If anything, American diabetics losing access cheap Canadian insulin Americans allowed Canada. continuation high school program based community experiential learning.

Non traditional, exist they're amazing wish 18 year old enough friends able throw party. 39 year old still doesn't. Agreed excuse never ok us it’s fitting Europe? Obviously there’s bias here. Bunch losers Still right. 

That’s CFR, measure testing rather covid’s lethality. 

The number you’re looking IFR - infection fatality rate: actually get covid, many die? 

But covid significantly stronger impact elderly, get accurate understanding risk really want check IFR stratified age. CDC numbers you. poor kid. duh ""What going do, fine me?""  
 -- Man fined  entirely capable following guidelines 18. Full time job, helped parents bills, went school, etc. stupid impulsive act. thought regard everything well aware going on. really hard considering everything available days chill Netflix, video games, internet sites, music, books, online video chats, social media, etc. $10,000 dollars would letting easy. Now, £10,000 would justice. idea using utensils cups someone else personally cleaned makes want throw lmao. know I'll ever able get idea head able enjoy restaurant. Idk makes neurotic weirdo something that's am.  Imagine telling everyone travels way tests positive go away... would go well. could tracked fined £100 afaik This.
They could made National directive, Trump could asked people make masks, keep distanced good U.S..

But money made that. many continue go anyways? article completely useless without information. would give almost everything able go massive party right now, there's nobody could give make safe. IMO, attendees fined, well. successfully downvoted you. Thank lesson. they’re RVing maintain social distancing, won’t bad condo senior community. They’d super vigilant shopping getting deliveries though. sucks, lot snowbirds depend warmer weather abundant access medical facilities catering seniors FL AZ. admit speaking ass spreading misinformation. 

Nice. estimation, think us feel powerless. We’re scared. people feel powerless, attempt exert control order counteract chaos.

Unfortunately, instead guiding young people, we’re instilling fear putting boot neck step line.

Anyone sort psychological training knows isn’t effective. 

To compound issue, combination punitive punishment, fall mental health issues could cause significant impacts families generations. 

People think looking big picture, we’re considering pick pieces COVID isn’t center lives. Wallaceism? never said entitled them. I’m expressing fucking sucks I’m fucking depressed. mental health toilet. 

But yknow, I’m horrible person Im expressing want enjoy college like everyone else me. think will. extremely arrogant. virus also spread frozen packaging apartment units. What's point?

This thread HOUSE PARTY. Equating outdoor protests 100% stupidity. Well, older bad heath, go eat inside restaurant. Also, lived older person. ate inside 2 times table 6 people entire restaurant. 

Some infections people's personal bad choices. Like birthday parties inside going bars. live country allows people make lot choices. also live consequences. many infections avoided individuals choose avoid unnecessary risks, like parties crowded places. older people want stop things. negatives liberties US, country based on. 

We entire world going live Covid years, least degree. going away Japan France too. US one advanced biomedical industries. probably access vaccines larger numbers almost countries. getting back normal sooner world. good bad aspects way US handling virus. think future, 6 months year now, amongst best world. Sanitizer still inflated, try find Lysol spray... italy? ""Alright, I'll pay $20 whatever fine is"". isn’t all. 

The second wave Spanish flu bad flu mutated much deadly virus. 

It basically entirely new virus second wave. 

This virus mutated way isn’t really able to. 

I idea people think two things comparable. One question motivations. Fauci Trump spokesperson, political reasons saying back then.
 
 Likewise, study study shows vitamin deficiency probably important arbiter whether COVID infection requires hospitalization - hear nothing Establishment media. money telling people take D3 supplements; hospitals, long tail medical industry, make money keeping people ICU.

 Unbridled capitalism wrecked U.S.. Well someone dig hole fill back year. Can't spend budget! thought Canada reported zero deathd finally

That reporting error. option populace understands ramifications. RemindMe! 8 Months Yes, mid late next year wide distribution earliest. difference contracting contagious disease sponsoring illegal gathering contagious disease spread. disease that's illegal. gathering that's illegal one ""cost"" gathering turns disease.

Yes, I'd happy people sponsor illegal gatherings made responsible costs associated gatherings, including crowd control, event cleanup treatment medical issues resulting events. get proper permits stay within Governor's mandates event size, get free pass pass costs public. felt heart rate slow reading response. Thank you. example shut orders. 

You look statistics compare countries test less classify deaths differently. also look see eyes. last months, seen one person sniffle. 6 months gone know 2 people Covid. know them, second hand knowledge, friend friend. know 1 death, second hand, 6 months. live area least moderate level infections statistically. I'm talking small town Kansas.

That even close catastrophic scenarios told back March. 2 million people dead. hospitals overflowing. 

Tell statistics give quotes.  know lived seen eyes nothing near told would be. say done really well reality lived. Yes, Also bad allergies grass I’m Around people mowing put mask feel like weirdo problem paying fine, also problem dividing fine known participants. share it, property owner/resident, really put stop it. assume bend toward flattening curve? Maybe I’m wrong fronts He’s hating, it’s great many wearing masks! he’s using less *praising* way saying comon’ gotta keep this!!! aren’t yet” Cummings believes eugenics thinks good thing spread virus kill considers weak. mean wants. obviously manipulating people government wants. people government wants? obviously reverse psychology ffs. person originally asymptomatic? mild case? doctor recently said it’s possible reinfection due someone getting light load, enough body fight it. 

That terrifies vaccine’s effectiveness.

Edit: based article, patient underwent “treatment” I’d assume least mild Maybe wait land cutting parachute time. Yeah, would hope vaccine take moves 0% n% , n whatever proportion able get vaccinated, life slowly returns pre-COVID normal, reach n% pre-COVID normal. 10 epidemiologists interviewed article said near-daily marches rallies nearly certain result transmission.  spread virus. Even yours. would probably get long term payment scheme. know someone accidentally owed 800 paid 5 week couple years heard MSU??? right. However, government said that, would riots. first weeks ""special measures"" (talking Switzerland, live) shortage toilet paper, also apples, potatoes, flour yeast. Alcohol gel anything resembling brand Dettox gone 2 months. panic. Imagine said anything implied ""you need masks can't give any""... 

(To lighten moment bit: [Swiss )

Edit: remember Argentina truck carrying masks hospitals [hijacked March 26th best advice time. learned knew understanding changing circumstances, advice updated. 

What want held account for? Trump’s advice wasn’t based best available medical advice. starters held accountable 10s thousands American deaths. water poured ice, ice become ""wet?"" think truth probably lies somewhere one. mild cases likely similarities. Severe disease probably causes worse inflammation however, common COVID. 

But whole idea makes sense. SARS-CoV-2 closer cold virus flu virus. likely cause nasty cold instead acute respiratory illness future loner novel resistance infections, vaccination, some, both.

I know rearranging cells heart former COVID-19 patients often show unique virus. viral infection something similar name Rubella Virus. There's least one two though cannot recall. will. winter bad capabilities masks wide spread protocols practiced.

It sounds masks dilute viral load enough healthy people handle without getting sick result temporary immunity months.

Next summer + vaccine pandemic done. No. viral spread increases due people staying indoors contraindication lockdowns? think, needs consequences gullible dumbass

proceeds convinced random redditor. Yup. Less likely, someone asymptomatic less likely coughing sneezing main way transmitting virus, even talking within 2m someone spread it, touching face/mouth (example smoking cigarette) touching something/someone else another picks spread it. 

If wearing mask catching COVID, however, that's much lower chance spreading it. Pro-vaccine vegan doctor here! Also pro life saving medicines. would ideal us advance point testing animals obtaining medicine animal sources (example- insulin) would norm. aren’t there. need live alternative it’s vegan take vaccine medication. 

As foil example: It’s vegan ethical test makeup animals it’s necessary wear makeup alternatives it, world needs better economic system, amirite economist.com?  longer lockdown lasts people’s resilience continue compliance erodes, it’d actually less understandable occur early stages late stages. It’s everything. football. Poor Texas 😣 Marvel origin stories like that: highly unethical human drug trials leading superpowers, followed justifiable grudge. “30 people exposed COVID you”

“But... hormones...” Around me, something like 80% people seem *yet* take covid seriously. Still bit shaky, no? can’t know similar. 

I’m far expert, study saw COVID talked heart structure changes presence heart damage markers. don’t see here. 

Also, timescales different. talks back normal 4 weeks, wasn’t COVID study tracking heart inflammation 2 months out?

I really want agree don’t see enough similarity results two studies. course masks help you, people always touching discipline keep hands masks washed frequently properly like medical professionals trained do. without discipline power protect wearer diminished extent, different everyone. wearers talks, coughs, sneezes, still keeps germs environment people. 

This going since February pretty simple point, still get this? confusing? request source this? Technically, 100% correct. Death prevent virus spreading, always. death becomes vector transmission successful, virus thrive kill. Basically viruses suffering numerous random mutations. ones end beneficial spread thrive, die out. becomes rapidly aggressive virulent, spread. drags death, causes symptoms promote spread, thrive. one reason many viruses go lungs. Long, long ago, virus mutated way caused irritation lungs caused animals sneeze cough. ended spreading virus, since massively beneficial spread viruses, became common feature natural selection.

One big problems human behavior. spanish flu deadly handled it. world war going on, soldiers mild cases stayed front lines. would spread trenches, generally bad. soldier got sick, sent back home. involved traveling crowded trains, crowded hospitals crowded cities, spreading virus went.  prominent thoery this, highly virulent strain spanish flu (otherwise known H1N1 swine flu), emerged, despite aggressively murdered people, often young healthy people, flourished due environment. would explain second wave would leave massive piles bodies, seemingly disappear within 2-3 weeks city. Also 25% got infected despite killing many. actually killing fast normally spread, keep carting fresh infected bodies crowded areas, kept numbers going.

This one reason concerned potential lethality new COVID strains. unlikely one rapid onset death find footing, maintains long incubation time, people keep getting keep going large groups unmasked, dry environments, could remove ""penalty"" virulent mutation would face lethal nature. 

If death infected person little stop spread, killing host becomes feature, bug, least until/unless kills many hosts anyone spread to. Well... long there's independent oversight... Absolutely. correlation isn’t causality dining (indoors) seem obvious place get it. There's also people cottages PEI even going back normal homes Ontario Quebec even though still better many places south border. Anything get rid pesky facts, eh? Turns real vaccine masks made along way. Yeah ok keep thinking take great care body even get virus would knocked little granted bounce back soon enough Get live life stop letting news tell anything everything coworkers mother rushed hospital Covid, meanwhile another coworker yapping “it’ll magically disappear November!” It’s nuts. get giant majority American electorate vote (poor people middle class people) best interests? Inundate continuous rhetoric, propaganda, polarization. 

In end, get ""American Exceptionalism"" populace war itself. Comparisons like invalid. Sweden size small US state far better US states

They better people listened experts [instead deliberately holding back testing *hopes* pandemic *killed non-supporters paid 5 cents per pound, would cover cost protections, better pay, full health benefits workers. 99.999%

Do statistics back number? blowing air ass?

To knowledge original ""untreated"" numbers **working adults 30's** mortality rate 1/400 1/500. still fairly bad odds talking strictly mortality.

But that's line looking at. many long-term effects think people leaving ICU, come close death, still live?

You need start using brain, thinking carefully. Plagues bend people, things inconvenient. outbreaks factories handling vegetables fruits, exclusive meat plants?  not. Also sample size less 400. greatest study. Idk. gave reasonable amount warning Jan.

The world reacted poorly. People hard hating chiropractors. aware doctors expect work miracles fucking work people cure pain due things place. Physical therapy work well case point shows always PT help right away might help all. go get massages help back pain anything else sometimes need cracked (especially upper back) massage can't always chiro visit can. think judgement reasonable caution supersede judgement person actually experienced disease? wearing mask make dangerous lmao Right wing redneck dumbassery win! Yes this. Bingo third message deleted post past two hours. planning bombard daily discussion day going take break point? high school friend whose father middle school principal. warned help pay college went teaching. never figure joke. necessary? probably reply imagine power green light medical study find side effects experimental vaccine.

How would solve without something lot people would consider ""evil""?

There pandemic going on, know vaccine distributed fast enough hundred thousands people die, perhaps millions.

There experimental vaccine cured 20 20 people agreed test subjects. do? Distribute drug without testing? test tens thousands monkeys, since genetically close us, would evil rather test people agreed. Great moral decision! 

Who willing let people experiment body possibility permanently affecting health? one except people desperate money. experimenting people who's circumstances forced participate. That's good either. do? check they're financially stable participating selfless. Great, filtered good 99% people wanted participate study.

You have, lucky, hundred people test subjects. there's side effect 99,99% chance affecting people, there's possibility going unnoticed. distribute millions people. every hundred million people, 10,000 people get side effects, perhaps even life threatening. even taking effects drug people preexisting conditions account. 

If would chosen decision experiment tens thousands monkeys killed tens thousands innocent people could saved drug tested properly. 

If consider saving killing experimenting monkeys less evil killing, experimenting monkies evil two option.

The alternative would let illness run course let millions people die.

If alternatives this, please publish results humanity profit this. say likely? got unlucky. unique unlucky experience mean people age need fearful. Considering administration power moment seems trying best help Covid spread much possible, kill many possible, start...? Well, there's nothing goals. Shame many citizens actions kill, admin sure seem give fuck. :( Wonder picked border?? #Why ONE single US University posted original microscopic images virus saliva? ""everywhere"" come US University done above??????  complain boomers... Quick—everybody panic even more! inventing new unthinkable ways daily! USA always country tries less 50 ways mess something up.

We doomed get go, state legislature wants feel like they're kings queens Fiefdom, take advanced heed anything, regardless topic, seen directly affect them.

Imagine Kingdom 50 Banner Lord's. well coordinated think said kingdom would be? Good job functioning Test Trace system! absolutely correct thinking give upvotes Dr.Fauci also said...you might tired hearing expert name subject, someone singularly prepared serving 6 presidents...masks PART solution.

Wash hands often

Practice social distancing
Wear mask

It matter arguments give GLOBAL treatment virus, starts you. get right, shove others like Trump, get worse. Period loophole let cohorts 10 4-12 come part days,


I friend gets vocal kind wording, like ""taking advantage loophole law"" thing. pretty much never ""loophole"". specific wording someone fought get legislation, regulation whatever, *because* knew wording would let avoid worst restrictions something close wanted anyway. Thank you. keep seeing people talk article shows things doesn't. Correlation equal causation. Figures Idaho. farther inland west coast, crazier hillbillies get. time get Idaho, got crazy rednecks protesting favor spreading disease. makes sense somehow, bumpkin brains, wearing masks ""right"" people gotta stand ""rights"". Newsflash, gullible simpleton makes twice vulnerable, disease manipulation. rest us right shun people like you. subside eventually not? guy it? Good. addition International Criminal Court really need International Stupidity Court.

I wonder city would natural home that. ASSHOLE spreaders! Dude, pandemic continent. Saying global pandemic specifies global. That's redundant, adding new information. Without ""global"", might referring pandemic covering asia example. I’d say whole talking point along lines of, “my personal comfort important public health” “you can’t tell do!” anti-maskers aren’t actually trying make people sick, don’t give shit anyone themselves. World fked, dont lack empathy, prove kids said Wal Mart employees go work every day much higher risk, teachers think jobs stories fat teachers dying COVID may may gotten school.  Whereas England week, college kid got fined £10,000 ($12,794.99) throwing party 😣 likely. concern lot scientists cardiology studies first published amount people myocardial inflammation, degree inflammation. happens lot people get myocardial inflammation common colds, isn’t studied extensively because, people, common cold isn’t dangerous.  New Jersey here, Labor Day weekend knew LOT people went hosted cookouts. rate transmission slowly started creeping recently, expect week see start skyrocket, schools, indoor dining, movie theaters opening within last ten days. feel like treatment gotten worse since covid? talking couple friends work food service said treated worse covid ever before. hard believe. Somebody literally risking health get double cheeseburger, hell would dick them? Lol exactly. realize he's joking right? Yeah, still need [put like reasonable logic, though. Well people think stupid. Anecdotal hmmm many it’s systemic. gov making point. tell now, kid Lenton, _""under influence hormones highly susceptible social pressures""_ holding big parties anytime soon. people wore masks, one would get immunity, though virus would still spread

Do concept epidemiology works? [even 80% people wore masks, even *US* would flatten curve would reduce virus' R 1.0. Even fox acknowledged ([non-fox Meaning could tamped without needing vaccine come along later. Love DDDs Decades people look back get whole ""wear mask debacle"". wear mask! Brilliant! Inorder give upstanding reputation, we'll also call ""lobbying"", means seen equivalent ordinary citizen trying influence representative."
