0,2021-06-23," 30-40% US? hospitalized couple weeks ago super young nurse beebops tells tachycardia since getting Covid takes beta blocker everyday deal it…she meh kind freaking her. That’s big deal. can't take them? Probably way buying time. spread delta inevitable, delayed weeks save lives. Well it'll battle COVID variants versus Vaccines too. country worst COVID strain? country best Vaccine?

Will Variant delta, new challenge delta plus. super Olympics COVID variant emerge take place ultimate victor?

Guess we'll find out! shivering point could barely stand morning after, went away got back sleep.  parent, remind that. school system long since bent wills ""back normal"" crowd, lord knows politicians gave children decades ago. work healthcare, lot RN’s wouldn’t consider average intelligence vaccines Ugandan Olympians use? That’s point masks Americans talk about? European thread WAY focused measures, mostly social distancing, experience, American threads masks masks masks. big deal there? Feels like another decent simple measure Europe complement core measures. know... vaccines work quite well. need billions larger percentage population (likely including children, Israel seeing) take want protect unvaccinated. That's fine. society decided back September okay sacrifice kids old people economy. Im going guess nearing end regular decreases daily cases. hoping see sub 10k vaccine rates dying Delta arriving… ugh. it’s successful business model work work long time, consequences damned. believe much believe tooth fairy exist. None.  Sticking first paragraph: RR extremely charismatic man. Handsome, wide shoulders, talked parables (like Jesus.) despise Reagan, give devil due.

Full disclosure: RR fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon. guy well second moderna shot. risky delta variant unvaccinated live highly vaccinated region (New England example). Asking family members also 10 month old daughter. Thanks. record,I,Japanese,am strongly against. again
Vaccines good.
Sensationalistic journalism bad.

Don’t believe hype
But go get vaccinated
Because not
I dislike gambling life  So, upload another database? possible check that? Britain big, predictable variations reporting day-to-day. 7-day average 11k, equivalent 55k US.

The issues these:

 
Britain done vaccinations according age group, extremely successful reducing hospitalisations. However, people socialise age, means virus still cause significant outbreaks among younger sections population, since spreading completely unprotected groups people. understand it, lot outbreaks neighbourhoods lot student housing.

Britain also large South Asian population strong links home countries substantial travel back forth India, Pakistan Bangladesh. means delta variant cases seeded higher numbers Western countries. demographic also substantially younger, likely live crowded housing slightly likely refuse vaccine compared British average.

Vaccination opened adults, special efforts increase vaccination areas particularly badly affected.

Some good news outbreaks delta variant we're seeing seem end quite quickly. Bolton first town big outbreak variant, cases going time now. Nearby Blackburn also seeing drop-off. suggests virus spreading unvaccinated groups quickly running opportunities. exactly. younger people coming hospitals delta variant apparently matters crazy anti-mask anti-vax folks appeased. 

I understand lot human behavior blows mind people willing risk lives children. potential spread mutate virus among kids real threat. guess kids traumatized wearing little piece cloth? Yeah. aren't. 

Excuse rant. I'm sick bs. getting ridiculous. UK better job much Europe vaccination variants going hit continent matter what. 

A vaccinated British traveller risk Germany vaccinated French traveller. reason work hard since 1970's, Robber Baron class taking virtually increased economy productivity. grew fifties sixties, full time working mothers relatively rare.  yet, money set aside college (MUCH cheaper), went vacations, etc.

Then came Reagan. new, ""flatter"" tax package....with Democratic congress going along....made sure Robber Baron class kept money. 

My first minimum wage job 1965 $1.65/hr. Today that's $14/hr, per inflation calculator. Yet, federally, still bit $7/hr.

Best luck business., can't take them, however. Israel 60-65% fully mRNA vaccinated, everyone 15-18 unvaccinated easily room variant spread age bracket infect everyone. billions doses, problem going solved large scale.

Since vaccinated people occasionally transmit delta, problem becomes worse. unvaccinated pockets potentially reached disease, rather protected vaccinations around them. 95% effective hospitalization still means \~0.5% country end hospital population exposed. can't handled hospital system (even spread several months).

It's 88% effective symptomatic disease knows % asymptomatic, still infectious. Yeah, that’s I’ve using. They’re scratchy compared washable ones. sweat lot work… feet day. But, gotta gotta do. like second pass 1918 pandemic. sucks. Guess I'm getting here. Good luck! 1st shot protection 33%, that's concern. need 2nd dose. 2nd dose protection infection goes 88% still robust. Someone please correct I'm wrong.  Except immunocomprised children can't get vaccine. vaccine needs positioned community benefit... Americans thoroughly selfish many seem care. frustrating. Infertility...  fact ""are glad"" (""whos laugher"") shows true colors. restriction addicts dont want end. Oh,I sinusitis too.I'm sorry ,it sucks! (I try take zinc too)

Happy belated birthday!  Fair, environment i've living Florida. know states also throwing caution wind. Right.  thought exactly. entirely household extended family vaccinated, except younger kids. daughter wants vaccine seen like person covid people recover go through. shit sucks would like avoid outcomes serious possibility. Highly doubt enforce logistics/airlines staff. 41% among unvaccinated younger demographics going die covid en masses first place, nowhere near sick 65's previous waves, well taking lot less time hospital beds compared 65's previous waves. 

The epidemiological data available PHE show case rates look hitting plateu next week two, hospitalisation rates rising line would expect respiratory diseases still remain acceptable levels continue plateau drop vaccination, deaths date death even budged upwards trajectory slightest. 

Don't try misrepresent make argument insignificant insinuating care clubs. life still affected lots people STILL cannot legally see 5 friends indoors, none friends gardens, space, ability private get together outside. might enjoying life right plenty people aren't. White House supposed safest place earth. test negative let in. Yet every one Trump's debate prep team, save one, got Covid, including Trump. definitely went debate symptomatic. already extraordinarily low. positivity rate NYC routinely 0.4%. 3 layer disposable medical masks comfortable. toss replace gets sweaty. (Really, anyway remain hygienic.) I'm Florida too, mentioned that. I'm sorry magnet program guys, vaguely remember sign forms school long time ago, know draw via lottery. can't wait 'till get toddler vaccine, goes everywhere mask, trust people. scientist, guess ‘endgame’ like H1N1, SARS-CoV-2 continues especially hardy (for whatever reason) member well-known family viruses haunts humanity level another eternity mostly kept bay vaccines boosters.   kid going upset Pfizer option her, she'll still get it, she'll upset 2 sticks instead 1. Show State showing us dumb.  far… Good. work setting like this, getting vaccinated choice. daycare owners perspective get it. doubt anyone’s getting rich absorbent rates now, likely running small margins. least mom pop places. yea, don’t know anyone multiple kids it. Especially parents aren’t earning high salaries. biggest concern deciding another child make average income. looked nanny covid way reach. Good. time stop bringing sticks gunfight.  like 5% difference   become new normal?

Roughly around time general public able vaccinated. vast majority armchair scientists sub, translates, somehow, 'pandemic over'. even mention thinking keeping masks open *everything else* get downvoted oblivion 'fear mongering'.

It's basic science. Shit learned early high school. countries individuals mask fine they're feeling good years. tell 'muricans wear masks everyone chance get vaccined (even explicitly say *literally* drop every mandate) get pissy that's 'normal' enough them. 

A pathetic opinion bunch selfish children imo; masks really nothing complain about. Especially since people still advocating least want places people go to. Like grocery stores need bring kid need worry getting infected. also pumping fuckton money education system. sad many people understand basic properties virus.

Essentially mostly everyone sub: availability vaccines + declining numbers = pandemic over. *Anyone* says otherwise 'fear mongering'. 

The ignorance palpable.  everyone background science context understand this. Many read headline, misquote it, move on. may even forgo vaccine due misunderstanding.

Is point literate people enough context background science make informed decision based trash article want fake internet points redeemable less ads gems? :P  Also second team arrived Japan.

Second team,first positive.

City worker also quarantine.Younger people yet vaccinated. That’s Australia spreading love, lol.   Where’s peer review pre-print? really means nothing viral fitness. Moderna put fiance pretty bad think never got covid. positive lower nose swab negative brain swab. results kind opposite his, negative lower nose one brain swab rejected labeled right. assume since testing place busy mixed tests up. sure covid still side effects it. Since already still feel worn tired little sick top huge deal. I'm essentially getting used feeling sick tired time guess. 

Most Moderna friend group also pretty bad side effects. worst ones people Covid well. 


Not saying wrong anything. throwing hat ring. Good!!! Thanks! too! mean, even groups equal double dosed group 10 % total. would argue even pretty reassuring. Taking account skewing groups makes reassuring. Clearly vaccines working. Jennifer Bridges, registered nurse lead plaintiff lawsuit Houston Methodist, said director called Tuesday ask she’d gotten vaccine yet made effort so. said replied “absolutely not,” told terminated. one supported anyway danger;;

(I first one vaccinated family includes extremely vulnerable young person) Also dont bloody FAT. Eat healthy pricks least light exercises function country's size. There's similar phenomenon compare US Europe.

The US, huge, relatively shallow peaks troughs virus causes outbreaks specific parts country. European countries smaller show much distinct waves. got feeling pfizer moderna playing numbers delta variant efficacy. Look israel. Cases shooting again!  mean... That's totally off-topic, yes agree scary.  Developing 16B doses 6 months logistical impossibility.

We're pace [22 billion end year. Presumably main producers - mostly China, also US Europe - exporting heavily soon. sentenced re-education. Perhaps tell IHME studies wrong:

Brazil actually done better job counting deaths comparable countries. depend rate breakthrough infections, hopefully stays low think unvaccinated people restrictions. much vaccinated person spread infection, state community spread.

What meant hospitals unable offer normal care affects everyone can't nothing. Hopefully real issue, I'm hypothesizing low-hanging fruit. drop R0 results achieving herd immunity sooner.

If politicized I'd bet nut till cases X number everybody would cool it. Unfortunately, Russian bots Facebook said ""oh god, hard wear mask!"" everybody immediately forgot fine wearing drywalling/insulating/painting hot summer days, fine wearing neck warmers scarves faces winters, wearing Halloween masks, etc. excuse claim hardship.

There people may really struggle—e.g. particular type claustrophobia—but dwarfed people really want feel like hard.   Mine fuck kids apparently Different countries, guess. seen preliminary studies show mixing vaccine platforms might actually result improvement immunity platform twice, think anywhere near conclusive. *Screaming Japanese*

I telling would happen vaccinations fantastic certainly great start! Unfortunately clear vaccinations **as** effective delta variant others. There's 41% increase number patients **one week** even opened completely. could completely open find back year half ago throw efforts thus far window that's really want, reality we're going certain safe enough us lift restrctions order continue help save lives, prevent NHS pushed over-capacity risk spread variants even further. 

There's upcoming goals us; continue vaccinating unvaccinated, provide boosters time comes adjust future vaccines towards prevalent provlematic variants. 

The 19th July going back lockdown, whether lift last remaining restrictions. act like right life dramatically affected can't go clubbing wedding 500 guests. Right things everyday life open go living life. one people love complain sake nothing better do. It’s semi sensationalized headline, I’m sure goal get people assumption kid fine actually read facts. headline isn’t false, it’s part facts think people know about. agree Think long hard making decision. Lots people brainwashed thinking children expected you, something everyone eventually does, be! 110% sure ready parent, go ahead some. remember, can't return kid hanging onto receipts turns like kids! Babysitting good litmus test tolerance dependents. Thanks vaccine deniers antivaxxers keeping human Petri dish available variants form spread!  guess concern vaccinated/partially vaccinated people could still spread virus unvaccinated people. Also, plenty fake vaccine certificates found around world. knowing truly vaccinated/not harder telling everyone certain group quarantine. There's still right work home (due corona) &amp; financial support can't Germany, quarantined either work compensated. Hahaha. want actual quotation marks? 1980s called. said internet hard you, come home.

(As racism? know Adam. nice projection, there)  even work? thought Moderna Pfizer compatible since work principal?  updated?

EDIT: too! Two days ago got mad journalist asked questions actions towards covid, got mad, removed mask, yelled her, telling shut up, went rant press ""merda"" (shit). always attacks press, time looked bit emotionally video, case curious, tone voice body language says all, find English subtitles. lock flu, statistically dangerous covid children.  could prioritize 1st shots like UK previously. Halt 2nd shots ~70% get first shots etc. would probably lot slow spread.

There's also groups likely meet/travel/not follow restrictions... Like university students. could vaccinate sooner rather later, one state US did. thought younger trend hospitalization older populations fully vaccinated already.  

If fully vaccinated less risk.

Under updated Health Ministry directives, vaccinated formerly infected people ordered self-isolate 14 days authorities believe may ""close contact carrier dangerous virus variant"".

On June 16, Health Ministry listed Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico Russia off-limits Israeli citizens residents unless receive special permission.

m-RNA vaccines perform better non m-rna. Pfizer 70% effective Delta, J&amp;J/AZ around 60%. 
Single dose m-rna around (just over) 30% effective Delta.  

Get vaccinated save lives help keep virus spreading further. makes lot sense vaccinate completely (well, enough reach herd immunity) several countries time rather entire world bit bit. sucks poor countries course, life fair. Reverse here! little tired weird “dead arm” poor guy fever crazy sweats three days. fine that. scientists know new variant comes out? can't find answer anywhere. 18-24 1/3rd first dosed UK since opened 18+ adults. 

By July 19, everyone hopefully one jab many double dosed many first jabbed young people weeks build antibodies. vaccines don’t work instantly, all. takes 3 weeks reach first level immunity dose 1, 2 weeks second dose reach full protection.

Most importantly, jabs work going hospital, reducing people’s experience covid nasty cold body pains fever. Ya. Covid didn’t impact Europe South America all. Hey! Gradually, bit bit, gotten better. certainly fully vaccinated (whether placebo effect not!).

Coping mechanisms honest around important. also took cycling exercise gradually built mileage week, 10 miles 20 40 helped hugely. tackle 25 mile bike ride wiped afterwards - 3 months back, 5 miles would floor me.

If affected long COVID lose hope, get better. proactive overall health, gentle build exercise hope works you! Rather 70+ rather mostly protected  group also delay 2 doses, thought reason higher efficacy. logical chances success similar chances failure? find fairly worrying highly educated generation ever stupid. Exactly. Everyone acts like got vaccine it’s they’re protecting unvaccinated anymore. It’s ridiculous people ignore 20% population kids That's effectiveness hospitalization fairly irrelevant situation, proper metric would effectiveness asymptomatic infection. Intentionally unvaccinated pro killing kids point wonder vaccination rate among college students moment. lol see, told you. CDC announced today indeed connection vaccines myocarditis. pretty obvious month ago actually paying attention data. elderly / working class popula

Why reporting earlier death? thought reported day. something like backlog?  disagree. think anyone making claim responsible citing source. Every reader need go google every claim read. potentially hundreds even thousands people coming number sources interpreted number ways person making said claim could provide one unified source. 

Regarding said doubt, *should* doubt EVERYTHING source attached it. way know know true. That's science works. problem that. think skepticism good thing, long using skepticism excuse confirm bias. can't seem digest fact called non-1st world countries also make vaccines. Odd find higher SSR rate Granblue Fantasy...... question. vulnerable population get vaccinated, virus mutate way dangerous general target younger victims ? 

The strains circulate ones bypass immunity. repeat foolish mistake pm made there’s risk fragile ego get hurt? Places like germany fraction cases uk has, delta still dominant. Unlike france, uks cases predominantly delta, absolutely makes sense handle like that.    need stop looking local sub like car crash can't look away. People batshit insane lost critical thinking ability. 

It's like want everyone stay locked 2023 care little Johnny obviously want die. large middle ground ignored. ""Extremely rare"" quick recovery. got sick dog 2nd Moderna shot (im 36) 36hrs. Im pretty sure heart inflammation somewhere chills, fever, nausea, aches lol long cases extremely rare dont hospitalize kids, think there's need panic. Ideally better proteins entire virus available WBCs encounter. However double edged sword. WBCs may ""learn"" important protiens watch due much input. shown real world data Spike protien based vaccines providing superior efficacy compared inactivated virus vaccines 100% not. Bolsonaro total disaster. incompetence  Authoritarian != Technocracy. Russian technocracy.

New Zealand/Australia successful geography isolation lack population density. Taiwan too.. they're islands. Even Taiwan half-failing ridiculous undertesting 4% death rates. also got plenty forewarning. Australian/New Zealand also managed copying China's strategies (Immediate lockdowns, banning interstate/city travel, significant infringements peoples right move about)

Containing shit China, first hit mystery illness warning (so tests even administer), weeks Lunar New Year 500 million+ people usually travel, definition hard mode. China succeeded. really trying hype people NPIs? things cost.

This compounded fact state seemingly stuck first phase months, partly people jumping ahead line getting shouldn't. state even country pretty well COVID-19 sure priority getting vaccine.

Thankfully able get fairly early, essential workers barely head start general public get vaccine. thin ice restrictions released context reality long gone (the initial covid strains).

Every outdoor measure relaxed, stronger strain covid spreading around. think look back months weep stupid being. wonder it'd mRNA vaccines COVID spike protein vaccines. almost certainly spike protein causes myocarditis, fats, salts sugars vaccine, since know spike proteins cause myocarditis. mechanism would mRNA vaccine would make one's body produce, say, hepatitis B surface antigen problem?

What 600000+ dead US alone? 

I trust CDC NHS morons like evidence J&amp;J 60% effective Delta variant. Gottlieb said that, think ever studied. was, results said study published. Yeah got point kind silly now. We're fully vaccinated would take test show we're negative. We're genuinely desperate spend money abroad! many little family owned restaurants visit year Florida miss. downplay effect pandemic definitely driving force change, US life expectancy decreasing years. think good measure vaccine making things better:

The last time figure 7 day moving average derivative positive October 7th 2020.

7 day moving average deaths June 23 2021: 10

7 day moving average deaths October 7th 2020: 53

Essentially comparing like like death rate little 1/5th was, deadly variant. I'm weaponising ignorance - blindly accepting vaccine can't possibly know long term effects sign healthy society.

There hundreds reports people menstrual cycles fertility cycles messed up. 320,000 adverse reactions reported UK alone, that's reported.

There's massive difference vaccines developed fight mumps, measles polio. vaccines developed refined number years, one developed mass-produced eleven months.

Yeah far seems like kids immune system handle Covid fine cases: remember asymptomatic, get kind ""long covid"" find 6 months. Sure, kids get really sick; ""long covid"" 6+ months really small number, exception rule (from data far, could change future, course).

Vaccinating children make sense limit circulation virus *if high proportion vaccinated adults*. population level, vaccinating anti-vaxx would probably work well. kids asymptomatic they'll develop immunity, become stronger wider time meet Covid-19. Vaccinating kids protect anti-vaxx sounds kinda weird ears. sympathy willfully unvaccinated. hope take anyone go.

It's called public health concern, reason suffering polio, measles, mumps, deadly diseases others cared enough fellow citizens get vaccine. lower efficacy preventing symptomatic disease mRNA vaccines. seems prevent almost well severe disease/death, though. #Yet Don’t smoke don’t fat Many states strict lockdowns past two months. strict even grocery shops even street vendors selling vegetables allowed come out. 


I believe stats given Indian government situation gradually improved India compared last month. Restricting international travel two months risk dying covid fully vaccinated going kill majority cases obviously going unvaccinated (hence first line saying vaccines fantastic), proportion not; like said, clear vaccines effective certain variants, specifically delta variant. reason cases plateu act rising cases - we're leaving be. seen yourself; rise cases certain cities, precautions put place slow numbers. putting ahead seeing 5 friends public people ventilators. guess that's choice feel life seeing 5 friends take priority hospital families obviously that's choice, personally came delay this, weeks months, personally selfish enough say no. Also, state I'm misrepresenting argument followed suggestion I'm enjoying life right - course I'm not. sucks can't see friends once, sucks can't travel abroad freely, sucks everything requires extra steps sort out, ensure book places far advance, way ever attitude things important preventing deaths.

As said, 19th lifting final restrictions otherwise face another awful situation result lockdown again. I'm going whinge wait little longer, again, choice choose to. Putin saying vaccine got really isn’t helping.  AZ significantly prevent asymptomatic infection

It fair degree degree equal widely used vaccines. * cries california * context? prefer give clickbaity titles views testing lower dose vaccine adolescents young adults? young people generally prime immune system perhaps lower dose enough?
 
anyway Sinovac test vaccine 3-17 years old immunigenicity 2x stronger.. wonder would case mRNA vaccine? sure downvoted. vaccines early (AZ other), people would able get shot earlier, undoubtedly would saved lifes. That's boosters :). Get vaccine, get boosters, leave unvaccinated alone.

The funds go towards production effective current vaccines. think recommended, yes. people legit medical reasons can’t vaccinated. people endangered people could get vaccinated simply choose to. Hence comment funds redirected. Manufacturing would place put them.

The world need 25th slightly different COVID vaccine. needs make effective. two goals outlined same. nature exponential growth, either creating conditions reduction (eventually near zero), widespread infection. difficult 'a bit' Covid going around, hence yo-yo lockdowns had.

Because long Covid, risk variants, risk vaccine work, widespread infection tolerable outcome. Hopefully comprehensive vaccination enough keep suppressed - seems likely scenario.

The question is, many people allow get ill along way? feeling taper restrictions cases always trending down, avoid exponential growth unnecessary suffering, roll vaccine age groups.  happen first second dose? Excellent work care anymore put comment another post here, I'm gonna paste here, explained happening Brazil now:

The Parlament currently investigating handling Federal goverment Covid, far seems like Bolsonaro bet contaminating people covid get herd immunity, ignoring companies trying sell vaccines. president also firing Health Minister tries prevent people getting sick, like comedy sketch shows (turn English subtitles). Bolsonaro also angry Parliment investigating him, accusing persecuting him.

He incentivizing people go social distancing wearing masks, state governors trying help people Bolsonaro seeing state goverments going agaisnt him, turned political fight. using fuel narrative persecuted lockdowns social distancing causing economy go makes followers mad health measures. São Paulo's governor former Governor Rio particularly angry Bolsonaro fighting political power. Rio's former governor even said imp34ched result going agaisnt president's wishes, think presindent gone far narrative can't back without looking like surrendering.

But here's thing, Bolsonaro lot followers, even see places votes also ones affected worse. incentivising public demonstration support followers ([without masks social using narrative anyone speaks agaisnt trying tear anti d3mocratic, voters eat up.

The state governors ones bigger job securing vaccines states, Bolsonaro accepting buy vaccines Pfizer (who tried selling us vaccines, [Bolsonaro months) due political pressure, many lives already lost needlesly. blaming deaths damage economy state governors trying lockdowns.

Introverts extreme anti-sovials like found many benefits past 16 months... dont enjoy pandemic whole, got vaccinated encourage people dont lock everything again, basically shut hospitals anything covid economically destroy future...

...but, know much relief me, finally people company worked home, could work office home without anyone bothering face-to-face (I prefer online actually gather thoughts reply later next 2 seconds), meetings zoom, presentations.... perfect working environment everyone leaves fk alone sends email slack message... outside work, meeting relatives, basically meeting anyone household members, finally perfect excuse meet face face.... antisocials great past year ask me, people werent dying, everything wasnt closed, government didnt manage waste money previous 10 years combined... already got well whole familly need vaccinate?

100-88=12

12/5=2.4 this. vaccine works like charm, basically anything happen US happen people think covid harmless. Great, thanks (I Spaniard, interested) think delta variant gains dominance, facts shifted, people get vaccinated avoid it. mask less useful everyone else isn’t wearing too, said provide protection. case one else wearing mask, N95 probably useful.

I would suggest paying attention risk threshold.

- Track local case trends county/city

- Make sure you’re fully vaccinated 

- Follow CDC guidelines.

The guidelines haven’t changed yet. Obviously they’re watching delta variant closely. haven’t deemed necessary change guidelines yet.

In regards people severe symptoms: yes, COVID-19 regardless variant serious disease. flu, it’s never flu. virus avoided.

The best defense vaccinated. talking german newspaper, expected EU idea u downvoted since saying dont unhealthy life. Smoking cause deaths 3 times less time covid. Im bad math. explain? pfizer AZ almost identical stats every single thing, studies AZ better. know everyone subreddit hates AZ much naive policy making. Killing mask mandate ""signal"" ""forget problem"" rather ""offering incentive"" claimed.

This fall slow motion train wreck.  would never relent. Well, really, that's caused someone left behind, mostly stupid antivaxxers. much non smokers smokers since smoking causes deaths coronavirus? should. High vaccination rates encourage complacency. entire world vaccinated, new variants continue pose risks vaccinated. bet sleep really well night. country, Spain, good aceptation rates, regions start problems target people 40. guess people 30-35 quite reluctant, difficulties exceed 70-75%. hope wrong, but... Comparing worldwide death rates US (with lower average cases/rates) thinks disingenuous best. end supreme court case. Sure, christianity true imply socialize said morons? government ever met deadline? Depends country. high uptake. Others, much lower. late. variant here, dominant weeks. Now, take hit vaccinate fast possible. even bother look links huh? second wave started Argentina end March per first link vaccinated people 7% time. people healthcare workers, security forces teachers. Also see cases falling past weeks 33000 18000 day.

And bothered look link actual death data see deaths falling among old.

Edit: also Oxford Gamaleya joint research mixing vaccines. think smarter Oxford team? effective give everyone household two shots vaccine? sub corrupt. Theoretically whatever booster develop would even better original first second shots sure anybody “know” even decide recommend them,’or recommend high risk demographics, think somebody relatively low risk would still able get one wanted? it’s recommended pharmacists, etc deny access?   half country never thought real half got vaccinated? Maybe, sure details regarding work published NIH. would assume though given note private data. would assume like filing patent.

It make sense someone put image strong beliefs, buckle direct confrontation beliefs.

But maybe people low standard they're willing post social media. enables spread misinformation actually believe push comes shove.

If get sense conversation becomes competition ideas shooting videos/links back forth, disengage, longer education, becomes battle ideology.

Try googling vaccine specific resources [how talk vaccine hesitant family also suspect psychological concept ""[deep used change racist prejudice beliefs helpful well. I'm that. daughter turn 12, things looking...okay-ish....for her, worry 9 yo son. Type 1 diabetic nonstop anxiety. thought 2021 school year could return normal, live state stalled around half population *can* get vaccinated actually vaccinated. Highly frustrating feels like huge part problem people could make easier us tripping conspiracy politics (our state definitely red) refusing so. Yeah, we're similarly start sending twins preschool 2 days week.  
 nice preschool keeps small cohorts mix others preschool, feel like ok balance. yeah definitely nervous it. keep wondering whether I'm unnecessarily putting harm's way, new debates whether they'll even approve vaccine young kids EUA, could forever actually get vaccinated. frustrating. Honestly, point STILL refusing get vaccinated end catching delta variant deserve what’s coming you. 

Unless course medical condition preventing getting vaccinated silver lining many people vaccinated, theory, slow spread Delta Variant well. general consensus seems haven’t vaccinated point that’s problem. 

There’s excuse everyone that’s wanted one plenty opportunities get it.

I feel sorry legitimately can’t, girlfriends mom auto immune disorder insane reaction flu shot years ago. mean got pfizer biontech got fever chills soreness headache next day too. hell.

So... really depends person vaccine guess. peak everything January vaccines available everyone. Sure deaths happened 2021, trends 2020 ease typing/less risk misreading terrible handwriting use frequent medicine notation mcg

I'd like think nurse would think meant mg meant μg based context medication typical dosing... learners usually mention ""sanity check"" recheck time dose would getting multiple vials. 

But despite happens meds familiar with... recently saw nurse grabbing 10 vials phenylephrine 10mg/ml x1ml thinking wanted 100mg wanted 100mcg 😅 honest media problem. science things mentioned either settled still investigated. It’s media outlets flip flopping constantly clicks. Speaking terms personal risk, wrong though

That's whole point - word ""pandemic"" means something affects **entire world**. One person's personal risk irrelevant that.

A accurate way put would ""the pandemic affect personally anymore"". Unpopular opinion true. Maybe it’s “second grade” country. distanced, use camera angles make look like it’s raise blood pressure. CNN every single day. rural area anything like rural area, still believe it........ Singaporean here.

Gum sold Singapore, unless referring medical gum. rich helps too. 🇺🇸 anti-vax resitant group world...2nd Russia

You seem lot trouble words ""worst"" ""most"" 49 cases province.

how high risk there?

&amp;#x200B;

in US - 49 found every 45 minutes. I’ve got ten month old. We’re staying holed get vaccinated, pediatrician thinks end year. plenty countries world yet gotten anywhere near access vaccines US have, ""just self-centered people"" ""needlessly"" dragging out. Don’t bother engaging report. Exactly. people totally legit reasons (like cancer patients) either can’t get vaccine need modified vaccine, like getting four eight small doses instead one two. would love see survey US participants, facebook seems ""no"" rhetoric lately, depressing Someone please tell scientific community stop studies knowses feel comfortable. trend downward several months now; virus destructive beginning year 95% effectiveness twice effective 90%. differences huge. Preferably degree social work dramatic arts therapy!  don’t want number reasons.

You remember one though: they're willfully, uncompromisingly ignorant. Covid gets subscription service don’t want Vaccines aren’t silver bullet. neither seatbelts. stop getting car today? Yeah it’s really tough. three year old seems fine also signs socialization skills be. expect child spent nearly half life bot allowed see play kids. 

Now goes gym class every week one wears mask. We’re California, place trust majority state herd immunity now. also live fairly rural area, also know people around us vaccinated. 

We make decisions people making vaccine trying balance kids welfare. Atleast now, like said statistics make feel better, I’m still cautious. Zero point vaccinating kids. actually gets complicated that. risk older people also changed time, even vaccines, things like better procedures keep virus nursing homes. 

Exposure virus also matters.  primarily around vaccinated, exposed virus first place younger people not. would expect far fewer old people die virus, regardless efficacy (the direct protection) protection lower overall spread older communities. get excuse hold “the safe Olympics”. Well reason isn’t self-centered people. job year. I’m going spend one second giving shit people needlessly dragging shit out. That’s problem point. mine anyone else right thing. don’t think county data helpful. county huge . pretty much stay small radius 10-15 miles neighborhood groceries , car repair , pharmacies, dinner ,work ect . Vaccination rates vary inside county differ based income , zip codes ect . I’m poor area many immigrants wasn’t prioritized . half aren’t vaccinated. Whether it’s gop , low income didn’t time bought conspiracy don’t know . used county data would think safe isn’t. It’s good know happening zip code adjacent zip codes determine risk tolerance safe .  hesitant one reason, potential long term side effects, ive covid waiting period advised doctor get it. Alot fears started subside Let sum Florida policies… 

We don’t give fuck anything. 

This isn’t something I’m proud of… think half population is…  wear mine conditions:

1. kids (5 7) there, set good example solidarity them,

2. business requires requests it,

3. approaching masked person, feel respectful wear one see another person wearing one (they're obviously concerned reason, maybe they're immunocompromised something). works, kids can't get vaccinated, lot people want get vaccinated.

Also vaccination eliminate chances getting infected, lowers lot. Got ya - understand. I'll resubmit using original title. Scare tactics. That’s is. whole, state 85 percent people vaccinated. breaks 58 percent one dose 49 percent both. Huh. right. 

The media really shit job subject. go back normalcy vaccine widely available. Sure minority legitimate excuse getting that's unfortunate. practical lockdown mentality virus 100% exterminated 2020s kids remember this: normal covid Trump's cult followers. keep hearing argument think problem. vaccines, including low-efficacy chinese ones extremely effective keeping people hospitals.

But understand, MRNA vaccines capable actually stopping infection significant rate herd immunity take effect.

Population vaccinated mostly sinopharm AZ still spread around significantly, protecting immunosupressed antivaxxers. yes, need protect antivaxxers, going ones keep generating new variants can't stop spread.

I may wrong, course i'm virologist lol.... would love proven wrong someone Americans really fucking stupid. Poor doctors nurses need month rest. Let ""god-selected"" individuals, self proclaimed, take care ""communities"". wouldn’t want feel bad go forth enjoy.  I'm fully patched, 5G microchip make go away? make sense compare 2021 2020, rather compare March 2020 March 2021, year length covid deaths really started happen larger numbers. 

So really years covid numbers counted March. winter wave deaths happening land year number change skews information disproportionately Yes - real gambles make daily. Take choking says 140 kids die yearly US. COVID killed 324 kids year half, that's 0-17 year olds. kids died 2018 car crashes. That's double COVID deaths.

So yeah, things riskier COVID children. telling protect child COVID, whatever think correct. lots important perspective consider here. COVID significantly less risk children age group - always best news virus, hopefully, nothing like COVID ever comes around affect kids significant way.  Given many millions people outside US aren’t vaccinated won’t getting vaccinated anytime soon, variants inevitable regardless US children getting vaccinated 

I’m fully favor kids getting vaccines variant risk overstated given sheer volume unvaccinated people worldwide. It’s far likely vaccine resistant variant originate outside US shit bro. get mad see people wearing masks tbh. many think it’s over? believed concern vaccinated didn’t think concern moving ignorantly world before. now. know anything long term effects, matter time unvaccinated reservoirs brew strain far, far deadlier kids. 

Keep mind first wave Spanish Flu impact kids, younger healthier people much. case second wave. effectivity based 100 people throughout phase 3, ‘for person it’s 95%’

For people it’ll weaker effect, elder fx, it’ll protect others completely, like young. People arent 1:1. I’ve read article. can’t tell article particularly headline isn’t sensationalized. Wow!  Never rated anti vax party intelligent bunch actions follow suit. someone tell anything Dr. Robert Malone?

He claimed one inventors mRNA vaccine seems one many researchers 80s. Many people vaccine quoting him. far.. Good thing access affordable lifetime healthcare possible chronic conditions - Oh wait……… decline coverage altogether they're unvaccinated older, at-risk age group.  Exactly. difference basically year’s worth research COVID. 

It’s like decades worth research flu.

There’s way know long-term effects. dispute people older 50 probably 2.5 times likely vaccinated, makes sense they’re 2.5 times less likely become infected. 

Are testing asymptomatic children, positive Covid rates occur children fever, cough, runny nose, etc? people deny day opposing vaccine get still deny it. Like somebody favour wishes SMH..  sure you’re getting downvoted. still haven’t FDA-approved so, yes, fast tracked. fast track took EUA. speculate may related concerted effort politicians media tell us things looking up, even actually aren't, yet.

Someone posted day ""down to"" approximately 300 deaths per day USA. said still lot deaths is. shitload people croaking every single day still virus. allow anyone downplay serious still is. strong business push whole time. Vaccinations mean ‘it’s best get’’

Which true. Can’t stay locked forever. people shouldn’t act like it’s still wear masks go things. 

I think people vested interest complete “back normal” trying hard keep information discussed. It’s kind silly me. People want about. info harm others much. let individuals decide. that’s including children. aren’t even allowed get (at least US). goalpost ""The two thirds US adults gotten vaccinated going go live normal lives risk us drastically, dramatically reduced personal protection vaccine reduction transmission large population vaccinated. vaccines dramatically reduce risk vector disease, going living normal lives major source transmission epidemic growth."" Sure, dual purpose. I'm saying hurry trials start jabbing them. 99.2% percent effective. Hopefully Delta. viral infection long-term effects. COVID fact different respect. [The flu known increase risk heart attacks, However, first time many people infected once, become hot topic. 

I even long-term respiratory infection left sore weakness two months 2014. needed get joke :) vaccines combinations would accepted. Canada true outlier (renegade?) comes mass vaccination.

It's weeks ago since default recommendation inoculation Canada stick manufacturer's instructions. say, Canadian getting first shot Pfizer Moderna month eligible get second shot 3 4 weeks later. month, standard policy extend gap 16 weeks stretch inadequate inventory shield politicians uncomfortable questions potential slowdown vaccinating people.

This means lot Canadians ""fully vaccinated"" Pfizer Moderna received two doses 8 16 weeks apart. time latest change dosing gaps announced several million Canadians already passed least 8 weeks since getting first shot. There's currently Hunger Games-like scramble us rebook appointments second shot. I'm currently scheduled get second dose Pfizer late September getting first one early month. next week, try rebook might/should able reschedule I'll get second shot end July (\~9 week gap) middle August (\~12 week gap).

Another complication combinations allowed. chaotic rollout grossly prioritized giving first doses, Canadian health officials reserve shipments giving second doses. whole program assumes vaccine deliveries stable predictable duration, we're using Just-In-Time inventory modelling run process. course, vulnerable disruptions like latest one Pfizer reduce deliveries next weeks production problems.

Like many European countries, Canadian government allows people got first shot AZ get second one Moderna Pfizer. Merkel get second shot Moderna yesterday getting first one AZ?

However, recent cutback Pfizer's deliveries means lot Canadians first dose Pfizer expected get second dose Pfizer week next suddenly offered Moderna second shot. Canadian government public health authorities declared kind mixing safe days ago, keep ignoring country kind mixing mRNA vaccines wide scale. answer whether mixing acceptable full vaccination travelling internationally next 12-18 months.

In meantime, lot Canadians taking chances cancelling appointments week next want get Moderna find later year ""full vaccination"" defined Canadian government meaningless according government border guard Europe, Asia anywhere else. Children 12 attending school without social distancing masks months. Children aren’t getting ill Probably. Good news probably also going massive overlap population needs long term care COVID (in US) providing healthcare people... least hopefully look forward revisiting topic new perspective later. mentality well. population never achieve herd immunity, there’s much do.

My hope lot people “not vaccinated” stats already disease herd immunity happen due that. variant seems get people easier vaccinated people still *some* protection. Florida news source. Welcome western hyper-individualism, societal Cancer modern world We're talking past interest conversation. depends whether COVID-19 impact people recovered. know scar heart lungs affects arteries. possible survivors might still decreased life expectancies compared people never infected. complicated you’re making it.

For one vaccinating younger people also lowers community transmission rates. It’s important. Obviously people choice, encourage everyone get shot benefits society overall. 

I got shot people myself. Super healthy active fit 35 year old dude, wasn’t scared covid wanted lower community transmission protect vulnerable people.  fact evidence contrary. know feel stayed inside 13 months I'm gonna feel bad going family vaccinated.  comment gets taken down, evidence motive beyond scientific discussion respect medicine within push vaccination.

Scientific medical discussion take place. Among scientists doctors. normies think know better doctors scientists pretend they're ""censored"" discussion shut go around spewing bs. I've seen folks going needle phobia people anti vax whatever, like really thing making confrontation helps one. They're scared. Like want help someone needle phobia get vaccine, talk quick painless was. Let’s forget children also human beings. Fair enough may bit higher, 80% estimate come true enough whole, lead horse water can't make drink. simple terms: 90% effective 10% chance virus still getting through. 95% effective halved chance getting mere 5%. regard twice effective.

Yes I’m starting suspect that… Moderna delivered reliably EU past. I'm pretty confident meet Q3 target. corrolary part point, COVID shot significantly effective flu shot, far, itll great kids get it.

Despite that, much less effective shot deadly virus pediatric population (the flu) certainly dont change behavior much, rightfully so. It’s subjective multifactorial, I’m opinion isolating young children another year(ish) harmful risking covid infection. RSV influenza dangerous children too, draw line? Again, it’s subjective. pro-vaccine, I’m keeping three young children socially isolated local infection rates practically zero.  immunity natural immunity. :) feel guys! That's rather crazy... Hopefully many people get infected result. discussed? vaccinated helps prevent infection, severe illness, death. vaccinated not. order talk effectiveness natural immunity, one must infected first, lead spread disease, severe illness, death. Natural immunity way real world observable cons theoretical pros. though? Looking Mississippi’s cases, seem following national trend currently all-time low.  Get vaccinated people. Please. guess I’m glad got mine? barely testing, real numbers could way higher. people test private clinics (cheap, takes minutes test get result) vs public clinics (expensive, forced wait hours results take days week arrive).

Private clinics results count statistics, contact tracing private companies take action employee says sick allow quarantine take sick leave without going hospital. backwards system.

I surprised cases EXPLODE moment Delta variant starts dominating. Half?  issue isn’t “trust” fact countries haven’t approved don’t want get stuck unable travel go certain venues I’m “fully vaccinated” standard international interpretation Stuff still says fine print, ""Not vaccine, use risk,"" legalese.

Why? Thanks. Looks like risk 25 year old quite low. amount people extremes same. Pretending people take seriously exaggerating disingenuous stating opposite. Um, 80 diabetes catch it, there's pretty damn good chance going pretty bad stuff you! would try track data outcomes 80s people diabetes. Romania also pretty high case fatality rate (over 3%) general.

My wife brought point case rates fairly high, factor million people caught it, probably natural protection. could also factor. 

Let's hope lot false negatives due variant, fear may also case. UK fully vaccinated people % total population 2 weeks they've quite similar levels even longer compared US. top that, UK vaccinated significantly overall, helps well. end, large majority states fare significantly worse UK comes vaccinations partially fully vaccinated. Cases dropping areas, delta becomes dominant, share people fully vaccinated protect rise cases, hospitalizations deaths UK able stop similar, higher, share people fully vaccinated.

I saying precautions taken. saying overwhelming majority states there's basically nothing preventing cases, hospitalisations deaths rising delta increases share infections. Perhaps seasonality, affect UK well. Add vaccination rates country overall low even many adults received first dose yet, situation drastically improve US anymore. enough partially fully vaccinated measures stop rise. rise basically inevitable country overall. drop stabilization cases/hospitalizations/deaths well vaccinated areas probably enough counterbalance rise less vaccinated areas delta increases share infections. Mask pray. wouldnt let kids - I'm sure many parents choice. best, that's do. Asymptomatic 15-30% original variant, it’s gone virulent strains… P B &amp; J ?  Nice aunt Links. Plural.

Nah Wearing masks/distancing helped stop spread flu past year.

I'll still wear mask cold flu season. prevent needless deaths I'm it. Germany debate wether hospitals reported faked numbers, got bonus every icu unit occupied covid patient. 

Also numbers never hit roof.

Edit: I‘ve corrected, Norway also placed order via EU. Fuuuuck. Sick Dutch people coming caravans Rhineland vacation summer. thought 3rd wave bad... WTF saying? Never mind. Stop sniffing glue. entire country? Hmph. don't. Delta will. There’s word this: Darwinism ‘engineers’ YouTube million views railing dangerous spike proteins are. I’m disgusted idiotic drivel encased pseudo science. old boomers too. 

They start “we know dangerous spike proteins are…”. can’t anymore dumb people. Wait, mean guys NPCs? presentation points risk myocarditis vaccine increasing age decreases. trend may may continue age groups given vaccine greenlight FDA. I'm saying right wrong we're vaccinating healthy toddler/teen/young adults protection, protection others expense. several family members inlaws anti vax least vax resistant. potential massive hospital bill, and, ya know, death, see let .0001% chance (or whatever is) kind vaccine complication sway them. 

I throw pile things last 4 1/2 years add totally relating huge swath people there.  Israelis? could really go bad become real “Second Wave”. happening right around vaccine distribution, along climate change, strongly speaks need stronger global institutions. world relying charity wealthy countries.  technically speaking, need permission, think pharmacists actually care. friend went got first shot without parents' permission he's 16. ask said concerned ""long-term effects"" pretended research, even though also said vaccines modify DNA. googled right conversation got exact opposite saying cdc's website. idk there's really much convincing do, think they're stubborn let minds get changed Yeah feel kinda bummed got JJ one. constantly feels like we’re left conversation America. It’s always Moderna Pfizer. AZ interchangeable way mRNA; mixing different deal (and studies show mixing AZ/mRNA fine improve outcome. countries already mix.) can't get disease. triggering immune system people autoimmune disease painful debilitating. kill somebody, yea could excruciating.  Who? (:P) Wow. 2.6 million people 16 total population 9 million. That's... kinda crazy. guess reaction makes sense clamp hard. That's insane number people 16. first wave worse politician planned. stipulate dangerous Delta variant allowed roam free.

I'd prefer act cautiously ""60 million people could die second"", rather overcrowded hospitals like Italy first wave. Yes that’s sad medical profession basically discouraging people. 

I remember someone telling doctor wasn’t sure vaccine safe saying: must know. like: eh doesn’t. 

I’m discrediting GPs don’t get wrong. GPs ones create drugs. might know bit us read scientific studies can’t. didn’t try guess. still can’t. it’s same. It’s dangerous. safety/efficacy standpoint there’s every reason think it’s fine. concern bureaucracy standpoint (will countries agree).

We supply issues. Moderna shorting/canceling shipments months many people got Pfizer first dose. need second doses, Pfizer cutting shipments us next weeks Moderna finally belatedly sending shots missing.

Supply imbalance: enough Pfizer lots Moderna; either mix make everyone wait second Pfizer dose. decided it’s better mix, especially given already eight-week delay first second doses. Uhh remember US mocked poorly dishing vaccinations countries already ""back normal""? Ya suddenly we're caught we're still assholes. trust doctors, immunologists, NACI far WHO. got Moderna dose first Pfizer. Feels great fully vaccinated. mRNA vaccines? “99.7% people fine Covid.” Agreed another lie- among many. 10 people I’ve know Covid, 8 alive, 6 still symptms. two, rather debilitating. Problem solved. first half lol glad read way Freedumb! stay masked mean pretty nuanced subject. 

When someone says vaccine x% effective could mean preventing infection, preventing symptomatic infection, preventing hospitalization, preventing death.

All info anyone wants it. confused. ZERO symptoms, panic again? still talking ZERO symptom people infect unvaccinated people? Public Health Scotland study confirming basically exactly — Pfizer vax 79 percent *infection*, PHE confirmed 88 percent symptomatic disease. aware yeah thats point-At point countries start drawing framework this? know zero cases impossible. also know infection vaccination occur mild vast majority cases. point accept finality it? Still understanding exponential growth? delta variant infectious dangerous variant we've encountered

&amp;#x200B;

[Table 3 report shows delta substantially less lethal virtually variants Finally, sky high estimate feel good breaking Exactly. mean, what’s another couple injections Olympic athlete? Yes I’m aware UK fewer young people vaccinated due high uptake among older age groups since generally socialise within age, means spreads much easily. you’re vaccinated zero issues resuming life. parents brothers fully vaccinated visit much possible 7 year old 3 year old (we live 7 hour drive away). still mask public, don’t take kids much, socialize fully vaccinated adults. they’re fully vaccinated, we’re going back life normal too. updated today.

One less idiot (and idiot children) lives blessing. state Maharashtra, India's largest metropolis Mumbai situated, launched investigation mid-May, adding 10,000 COVID deaths June eastern state Bihar, made headlines dead bodies washed banks Ganges river, added nearly 4,000 deaths single day June northern states Rajasthan Uttarakhand begun audits, Uttar Pradesh, also come repeated fire covering COVID deaths, yet launch official investigation.

… good idea keep masks long people waiting vaccines

Any evidence benefit? feels? people able remember super liberal folks anti vax crowd??? essential oil folks? political thing holy shit. literally nothing whether conservative not. everything whether crazy not. Guess what? Crazy people voted President Trump. Crazy people also voted President Biden. ... wear face mask mouth nose instead chin?  Overall, yes, see NJ good reference point. Lots current cases Delta variant. Spacing links help.

There's line break them. going respond like overlooking link, suppose there's much left guess rational rest response going Getting rid symptomatic infection goal vaccines ever. People getting running nose issue, hospitalisation death is.

Completely wrong counts.

Sterilizing immunity goal many vaccines, though unfortunately, unattainable cases -- like COVID, time being. attainable, however, great way permanently wipe disease least safeguard regions epidemics.

As people getting runny nose... issue, right moment spread disease someone who's immunocompromised vaccinated. Then, becomes issue.

Not mention last week, 10% hospitalizations UK fully vaccinated patients (2 doses 14+ days). although effectiveness hospitalization good, complete -- means large enough epidemics still plenty damage even large portion population vaccinated.

[Here's study last year effectiveness needed prevent *""This study found vaccine efficacy least 70% prevent epidemic least 80% largely extinguish epidemic without measures (e.g., social distancing).""*

The numbers different right delta variant infectious, study shows quite well vaccine's effectiveness preventing infection (rather hospitalization) important: actually helps stop epidemic.

Moreover, let's forget large epidemics regions high vaccination rates form perfect breeding ground variants better job bypassing vaccine-conferred immunity. problem vaccines help prevent epidemic, rather soften conclusion study says

As numbers study ""*With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced 66.1% (95% CI: 54.0 75.0) B.1.1.7 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 77.3) B.1.617.2.*""

A longer interval vaccinations contact virus might push effectiveness little, now, numbers we're seeing AZ disappointing. would think numbers risk incredibly low sides. 

It matter either way. vaccine may make feel like shit weeks. want natural antibodies (your need test confirm though) matter get it. think people legitimately enjoyed pandemic precautions wanted last forever. 

I mean working home part, get. 

But think maybe people like parties concerts sporting events crowded malls anything. means they’re sitting home fuck-all, they’re missing wasting life; it’s norm. You’re really understanding conversation you. Arguing semantics doesnt help, it’s misinfo tell people vaccine prevent getting covid, doesnt. nice day parts US MUCH lower vaccinations rates UK. places think trouble. Pt, people vaccinated-- nobody 35 vaxxed yet. I've never wanted stabbed pointy object more. Agreed. Trying convince everyone know get jab. 

Not going well. feel like pretty solidly walked point admit currently evidence. soon tell one thing vaccinated infected delta; another many hospitalized apparently severe disease. understand logic behind non requirement new technology vaccine received long term testing humans yet, want give people freedom choice. clinical trials mRNA vaccines end ~2023 Cringe Australia's lockdowns also done state, still much shorter Canada. Israel's decision nothing grounded science grounded science. 

Science says Rt currently 1, means spread occurring. Science says vaccines certain percent effective help predict many hospitalizations deaths may occur result widespread uncontrolled spread unvaccinated communities (and spillover vaccinated ones). Science help predict (imperfectly) pharmaceutical (e.g. mandated vaccines) non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masks capacity restrictions) may Rt context currently circulating strains. 

The decision done data social political one, scientific one. may perspective ""well, variables show even Israel maintained restrictions allowed uncontrolled spread, 750 unvaccinated 50 vaccinated people die, societally acceptable compared X risk disease, especially since vaccination status personal choice Israel."" becomes *normative* judgement, scientific one. /u/FusSpo nice edit made there. enlighten us truth there’s clearly information directly disputes article made guesswork actual data. Yup. get live choice make. 

I mean, not. Sometimes don’t. Get live is. Careful, people like questions asked. actually mean table 4 shows CFR 0.6% Vaccinated, wary, weary parent two young children here. *do* take children outside. *not* take indoors public spaces. would could wear masks, alas, young wear wear consistently. close, prolonged contact unvaccinated people. 

I agree risk death children quite small. children get sick insignificant number experience lingering symptoms could well affect rest lives (recent data UK puts number 9% kids age 10 become infected). Breathing problems, fatigue, ""brain fog"", cough... know list possible. Yes, less likely happen someone age unvaccinated (about 20% chance developing ""long COVID"" someone 30s 40s), willing take chance children. love deeply also (hopefully) 70-80 years life ahead them. time scale, even ""minor"" lifelong symptom adds lot.

So, please understand many parents - even ones children playing outside - still much living pandemic even not. kids, would worry.
I think much either daughter failed school's precaution protocol; get test return. learned LOT Delta variant waiting results. shouting ""pandemic!"" Like Michael Scott declaring bankruptcy misses nuance critical thinking. 

If vaccinated USA, going back pre pandemic life 100% selfishness, normality. USA seeing covid issues countries...were lucky I'll give that, also need realistic situation. 

The dictionary definition pandemic useful daily lives people seeing cases communities right now. kids 12 think said vaccines 100% effective stopping infections? absolutely aren't, one thinks that. also completely falso say ""vaccines prevent getting disease."" absolutely prevent majority people getting it, yes.  


Here, data available look yourself, specifically going want look PDF pages 60 62.  
And here's Moderna's, PDF page 28 keep simple you:  remember threads beginning Pandemic people saying ""please stay home keep elderly, young, ill safe,"" so, many folks commenting unfair go Spring Break get wrecked. 

It's similar people refusing get vaccines *if they're able so.* Get shot protect can't. That's whole point. need get 3 weeks first dose. Delta variant catching lot incomplete vaxxers first dose. know Covid dangerous young, infants died it, I'd prefer reduce risk best can.

We also nearly enough data long-term symptoms know whether severely affect children. absolutely right careful.

Hopefully vaccines approved soon younger children. know trials going now. don’t think poster disagreeing you, instead pointing vaccine-hesitant people see fast tracked misunderstanding exactly means

It’s say people aren’t incorrect assumptions, that’s hook they’re grabbing onto. Yarın 18:40. Turistlere Enjoy I'm vaccinated diyebilirim artık :D it’s anything like UK cases rising aren’t resulting hospitalisations anymore due vaccines good thing don’t think fully go anytime soon catching means feeling shitty like flu sounds like right direction. understand. point difference estimated confirmed infections reason stop using data.

My point always big difference two, reason question 'anyone still looks thing'. based math statistics. Yup factor ~90% efficacy vaccines already need around 92% population vaccinated going hard reach without making vaccines mandatory.  That's pretty common It’s people get vaccine  Study highlights **importance vaccinating uninfected previously infected persons elicit cross-variant neutralizing antibodies**. fuck Pfizer vaccine 90% effective yet 40-50% cases fully vaccinated people? Makes absolutely sense. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I mean u vaccinated people still thinking Earth flat? Americans dumbest people planet... understand right, original comment worded differently wait revised patch version. Article Sep. 2020, last data point 10th June 2020. much know Covid June 2020? Besides, Singapore airport outbreak data shows significant transmission going among vaccinated people, one-dose fully vaccinated. know people asymptomatic symptomatic.

That even Delta variant. Truth is, know. Transmission reduced compared unvaccinated, much? good idea keep masks long people waiting vaccines. people people nobody it. couple days ago thousands unvaccinated people flocked UK watch soccer party night. would roll back? risk tolerance zero permanent standard. waste time become. There's second issue immunocompromised people well. can't sure vaccine actually worked, know, account compromised immune system. mean page 43 say:

""There increased hazard ratio hospitalisation S-gene positive compared gene target failure (1.8, 95% 1.4 2.3)""

When sub stop reading actual papers start compulsively downvoting ignoring negative news?

The vaccines great everyone get vaccinated, false say covid zero threat fully vaccinated people. There's threat, greater Delta Alpha. still get covid buy won’t terminal. Nine Yankees personnel players got covid even though vaccinated. outbreak government office Manatee County FL vaccinated person exposed didn’t get covid two coworkers died. Seriously. needs redone bottom up. mostly non-vaccinated getting it. 

🤷‍♂️ fuck 'em Darwin thing. article mentions young people fewer ACE-2 receptors therefore less affected. would also case Delta variant. suspect trials underway 12s hopefully we'll able vaccinate long. adolescents tend milder disease adults, unless part group higher risk severe COVID-19, less urgent vaccinate older people, chronic health conditions, health workers.'  'more evidence needed use different COVID-19 vaccines children able make general recommendations vaccinating children COVID-19.' much risk spreading virus infected it, vaccinated people close 0%. since cases continuing drop weeks mandates lifted, think safe say effect vaccinated people coming together minimal.  entirely untrue. People still dying one thing almost universally common: vaccinated. Pure clickbait GTFO think *possible* get covid vaccinated, vaccine stop covid? assume trolling. No, vaccines 100% effective. Moderna Pfizer appx 95% effective. said, no, still wrong, sorry. incidence curves track infection rates amongst vaccinated vs. unvaxxed people trials. Good us, incorrect. :)

Here, specifically going want look PDF pages 60 here's Moderna's, PDF page 28 keep simple  half America ignorant...no wait stupid better fit .. also believe science.. 88% efficacy symptomatic infection 2 doses Pfizer 79% efficacy infection *entirely* 2 doses Pfizer

You’re spreading misinformation. comment junk    88% efficacy symptomatic infection 2 doses Pfizer 79% efficacy infection *entirely* 2 doses Pfizer

Your comment alarmist ill supported evidence thing read wrong... childless adult, keep reminding this. twelve unprotected still. Source? consistent trend around world reported centuries least, yet birth control abortion access way easier poor century ago.  UK pushed-up second doses well. 

The erason obviously think something reports 1 dose effective delta variant, two doses are. Always somebody’s else’s fault. think read post wrong Vaccination means body already recognized virus signature early able fight right away. mean can't get it. mean severity less vaccinated, possibly lot less, unlikely would level requiring hospital.

It's also idea vaccinated people can't carriers seems crazy me, especially low level asymptomatic ones. it, regardless bad ends being, please stick avoidance others masking necessary. reason cautious.  understand concern. US daily case rate currently low levelling off. look UK see infection rate growing like mad. higher percentage people vaccinated yet things going badly. Presumably due Delta variant taking over. US Delta prevalence much lower, doubling every one two weeks. causing increasing infection rate UK, can't see reason us becomes dominant. doubling every week two, take long. can't anything stop except personal note, get shots now. may still get infected...but get sick. Works me.  majority adults vaccinated see children getting infected major unvaccinated group left.  88% efficacy symptomatic infection 2 doses Pfizer 79% efficacy infection *entirely* 2 doses Pfizer vaccine

The guy right. You’re spreading misinformation  extremely small number...

Please don’t try “gotchya” lines   wonder army clickers China downmodding things want off. assuming fine now, also new admin. Thanks. hope enough Americans pause watching Dancing Stars whatever do, go get vaccinated ""flying Delta."" happens make get another batch shots? fess say already vaxxed? Actually, study Netherlands found obese people lower lifetime healthcare costs die earlier. also save social security lot money.   Wow, 6.35kg, half kilo day. That's pretty scary. people misconstrue warnings fear mongering? mean surge relative earlier pandemic? Sure. city 600 deaths total never hit ICU capacity. believe American city similar size (and certainly none similar density) great numbers.  Succinct way put it. Imagine future people inject covid tounge help lose weight way people inject botulism foreheads lose wrinkles.  No, vaccinated travellers exempt. whole point. need accept new variants keep appearing cannot keep lockdown, quarantine cycle forever. Vaccinate whoever let us move lives. get it, I’m saying sucks Exactly. can’t find perfectly competent people live *drastically* competent governments.

Especially since competence, America rates near bottom developed nations. Sounds sensible me. Keep they've finished vaccination. Lmao hmmm wonder headlines see straight lies... oh thats right, them. Honestly fuck media, money game that’s completely unreliable God, dysmal. truly hope things get better. Maybe Delta scare crazies. Fingers crossed you. Seems like good reason gOverNmEnT lIeD mE

It's pandemic. going resolved overnight. Events continually changing need act accordingly. It’s definitely Florida grew in. mean, never top curve, it’s turning Alabama.

Gotta love Late Stage Capitalism wonder long starts resulting substantial loss business.

Recently barked store mask. said vaccinated, said care, walked one me. (I usually carry one forgot day.)

If enough people that, bullshit likely stop sooner later. Miami BTW. New variants appear CONSTANTLY on, that's viruses work. cannot keep lockdown/quarantine cycle forever. need learn live coronavirus accept risks. Vaccinate whoever let us move lives.  Actually, study Netherlands found fat people lower lifetime healthcare costs die younger. also saved social security lot money.

I'm totally pro vaccination way - mean easy backfire anti-vax people paranoid. 

They think there's conspiracy manipulate people getting vaccinated false pretenses. there's article say ""yea ok let's conspire!"". reality true pretenses course, conspiracy erode trust none less.  entire page become delta, delta plus, delta ultra, delta omega-3  Thank you, too. person position make good estimate told 10 percent vaccinated work. person required ask, not, think, ask proof. Apparently often angry vehement vax. guess 10 percent start :(. shame workplaces keep people informed. high risk area. 2 days coming home town got email city.. „quarantine 10 days“ - today police rang door check me. living south Germany. I‘m idiot. 

I read post realized would mean Moderna Pfizer dose size. We, Europe, would literally swim MRNA vaccines would probably done now.

Never seriously thought it‘s obvious. Maybe Oregon, states locking again. Good bot. sure going go, though. Europe serious issue vaccine skepticism well. worldwide phenomenon, ones US louder. Update flair! Yes it’s kind brainer take pfizer moderna vaccines AZ given choice. 

AZ still value developing countries. Pfizer Modena adapt vaccines use forgiving storage conditions would massive win. hope hard work figuring improve storage conditions also tackle variants.

**More 130 Secret Service officers said infected coronavirus quarantining wake Trump’s campaign travel**  Smokers really get screwed. save health care social security bunch money dying younger, charge extra it. Wake exactly? Elaborate please? article already posted yesterday. 23 March 2020 (plus minus days) seems peak ""oh shit gotta something"" period. whole bunch places went lockdown then.  found easy KNOW little bastid lying.... 1st thing...look lips they're moving lil fk lying  US, people access vaccines months now. Cool story 😂🤣 husband still wearing masks even though we're vaccinated. taking tiniest risk bringing home kids. 

Michigan lifted COVID restrictions yesterday. vaccination percentage 50s. went Kroger yesterday people there, one entire place wearing mask. worried here.  You’re moron lol. Literally google question tons journals inconclusive. VACCINATED DOESNT MEAN CANT TRANSMIT I’m Riverside County really shocked bad Covid county aren’t vaccinated . said, live area lot red voters.  think huge inconvenience?

Yes, absolutely.  Refusing healthcare sounds fine isolation, that's we're really taking about. We're taking whether right freely access societies services benefits granted someone willing bare minimum protect society. We're talking right infect potentially kill people. Language matters. virus reaction part social contract, need collectively decide move forward. Copy editors ones write headlines time, usually quick perusal article, grab salient part make attention-grabbing headline. journalist/reporters don’t write them. may another option companies suspect happen: go Social Security people file disability claims &amp; contract doctor city. sure would work well not, though. would imagine doctor see access full medical history.



I surprised little asked upon booking appointment determine eligibility vaccine. answers clicked actually sure (certain allergies knowledge either way). cases yet people getting mRNA vaccines &amp; major problem come proper screening would've weeded out? Says person using social media wonder many resign secret service 2020 alone?  10% hospitalized patients delta variant fully vaccinated. continue wear masks herd immunity built say understand you, relate feel you. hope things get better. bad, medical data super sensitive think ever knowing colleagues vaccinated possibility. feel unfair knowing it, least aseptic standpoint: ""80% staff vaccinated"". want, want back office.  my.  got downvoted heavy saying  probably reached time high collective stupidity somewhere 2018-2021     problem is, it’s basically impossible gone completely. Yes- vaccinated parents fine physically. can’t pretend kids somehow protected proxy. Especially everything re-opening kids back daycares schools surrounded unvaccinated littles. 

So like said- vaccinated parents kids 12 option vaccinated.  See, issue presents lot people dying getting sick anymore. Would truly willing never things people getting sick almost none dying? comment incoherent I’ve reported uncivil.     Large african american populations? It’s Reddit. stereotype basement dweller life outside website exists reason, such, sub very, biased. hope government Repos every car road starting tomorrow seatbelts fucking perfect either. Tam needs crawl whatever hole came never show face public again. Source?  there’s also odd interconnection Secret Service HSI. friend HSI supervises Secret Service teams, fall count Please stop lying. data suggests original covid 0.1% mortality delta less lethal original covid. Either get vaccinated keep afraid. current rate based numbers take 395 days it. Oops. forgot subtract 2.8bn already given...330 days go. Sounds like wishful thinking really get everyone planet vaccinated 11 months, maybe lot manufacturing coming online still come?  really understand difference context disease **never seen humans** radio technology that's mere step-up currently existing decades old technologies? Toddlers danger covid. fine regardless. UK data includes efficacy testing positive well. numbers somewhat lower, 85-90% mRNA significantly lower weaker vaccines. find publications roughly weekly.   easily find case rate among unvaccinated area. That's risk have. long enough vaccinated, unvaccinated protected. enough vaccinated, unvaccinated probably get sick. Remember thing ai programmed sole objective running paperclip factory nothing else, would eventually turn whole world paperclip factory convert everything paperclips? starting feel like that. Absolutely nothing matters Covid prevention people anymore. shooting everyone leg would decrease chances getting it, they’d damn well it. 1. vaccine determines likely get sick come contact virus. people's vaccinations determine likely come contact virus. combination two determines likely get sick.
2. vaccines strongly mitigate transmission. vaccinated person much less likely infected, much less likely experience symptoms, also much less likely asymptomatic spreader.
3. Wearing mask alone, like jacking wearing condom, confers appreciable safety benefit. enjoy it, go it. r/woooosh it’s not.

‘Labor’s worst ‘

That’s defend current government’s handling. Everybody wants thing understand refusal acknowledge sounds like dangerous strain covid insane way detriment families many unvaccinated realize .  


I look forward opening back , look forward friends family dying go picnic without mask. dying dying options. Also, vaccine free, get it? get kids flu shots, get COVID shots? bah Lmao got em queue az depend many cases county (or adjacent ones). Almost everywhere US really, really low prevalence currently. Polio 2 doses 90%, 3 99.9%
Measles one 93%, two doses 97%
Diptheria one dose 97%
Pneumococcal 89%

Just went list CDC website.

I'm vaccinated, ""stupid"" say 79% efficacy great.  single high quality study ivermectin.

You search /r/covid19 lot low-to-meidum-quality ones. He’s correct. 

Humans generally shitty. So. Fucking. True. help ya, help ya, help ya? go free rock climbing? Sure. 
Can drive without headlights on? No, impact people yourself. Note: there's backlog deaths due Father's day+another holiday. Deaths still fell 6.8% past two weeks. period, cases fallen 34.2% - good trend still peak first wave. heard anything yet.  taking account single year (2020). agree statistical anomaly majority Americans wearing masks social distancing. facts based couple previous years exactly point. flu has/had annual deaths per 100,000 people children compared COVID. one (very few) concerned children Flu, massive concern children COVID? fact COVID less deadly past flu seasons children. 3000 dead children Brazil reportedly gamma variant

You gotta source that? US there's grand total 324 covid deaths ages 0-17, that's 10 times less deaths country larger population. mean.....yeah...it meant gross simplification children whole lives ahead them. even afflicted ""minor"" long term effect - say, permanent reduction sense smell, fatigue, breathing difficulties, brain fog - course child's life...that accumulates actually minor effect all. 

Recent data UK indicates much 9% children infected COVID experience kind long term symptom lingers infection clears. insignificant number children looking millions infected. anyone high quality studies ivermectin. Listening Bret Weinstein JRE tell he’s full shit lot stuff idk much ivermectin I’m familiar publications reliable. *Fuckin' *same*. got second shot days ago I've repeatedly told already 'you're vaccinated now, still wearing mask?' Umm...because *6-year-old* can't get shots yet? know damn well wearing mask whole damn time attending 4th July party, thanks much.*

I'm quoting person responding to. know follow nested threads? fault can't keep up, chief. kids used they'll even wear house remind they're still wearing them. yes second Moderna came pretty strong arm pain lasted day half like first dose - nearly debilitating fatigue full day. in, couldn’t leave couch could barely stagger bathroom. Along creepy ache made way aware every bone toes neck, appetite, brain fog mild fever.

I felt like hundred ten years old.

Still well worth though. I’m closely exposed three thousand people per day. vaccine effective enough I’d happily take lot sicker side effects.

(Fifteen know family/close friends got Moderna. four side effects level worse. lightly-affected arm pain.) husband side effects second shot 2 days. prepped ahead time heard women possibly harder time I’m SAHM 3, can’t chill sleep. movies ready, dinner ready throw oven, toys nearby….I didn’t even spike fever. sore arm, little tired (solved nap), slight rash arm. reacted far worse TDaP months prior pregnant. strange affects people differently. Nothing 100% problem. Masks, distancing, nothing 100%. way completely mitigate risk anything. unaware, Covaxin inactivated virus vaccine Covid-19. effective inactivated vaccine good thing imo. almost always bring 0 side effects, people tend trust inactivated virus vaccines others, since used decades. No. Read article.   Brazil reporting another case record late game pretty fucking scary. They're lot pain. suggest look efficacy routine childhood vaccinations making really stupid comments like that. Vaccines might add often don’t even stop transmission like do. Could kids one primary unvaccinated group now? compared earlier, much higher number adults getting it. house people like Open Google shitlord husband similar (he fell 10’ ladder onto concrete - shattered elbow, fractured sacrum crazy amount nerve damage). 

He constantly adjusting standing, sitting, laying down, walking, pillow adjustments, etc. He’s constantly taking medical marijuana, somewhat comfortable. sleeps hour increments, adjust positions (I’m night owl, he’s constantly asleep awake walking around back sleep). 

He’s denied ssdi twice far. He’s 54. It’s pain ass. sucks. stuff wanted us; go visit docs, fill 20+ paperwork packet, write used / can’t anymore, etc., list current docs treat him, more. 

It’s fun pain uncomfortable 24/7. It’s fun seeing either. language headline ambiguous. One could interpret headline saying child susceptible catching strain adult vaccination status, distinct concept saying unvaccinated people susceptible children much likely unvaccinated. former would unique development, latter, much. No. absolutely not. negative data children inconsequential it’s worth investing one second brain power in.  shameful. discrimination ok discriminating affects bottom line. Yes, degree. Also state freedom choose still others. Also, want replying care, post public forum.  I'm fully vaccinated 100% support right refuse.

I like we're headed vaccinations become condition employment. conditions mean can't get vaccinated? lose jobs too? symptoms except last two think :👀 False, unfortunately.  


Last year 300 American kids died Covid, 30 died influenza. /r/byebyejob    Vaccinate shit goblins  I'd like learn infection threshold, good material that?

Has world lost reason ability see nuance? Nothing black white.  Yes, telling CDC guy's little sister school Indiana definitely make change guidance kids masks.  Fauci appear headlines give depressing hopeless outlooks pandemic? things looking good pre-delta, didn’t see articles anywhere. Hey Computational Biologist here: putting stuff SRA asking removed (especially since updated), totally normal valid. SRA (along databases like EBI DDBJ) hosted NIH, rights data still owner's hands.

Check NCBI's policy ""Molecular Data Usage"" here: able get vaccinated? turning politics point completely wrong? I'm actually fairly confused incivility. Lol kinda dumb shit fact suggests market sequences, primary focus genomic epidemiology in the joint WHO-China report ... representative viruses circulating Wuhan late December 2019 early January 2020 one (delta) good…the next one (gamma) bad…which already prepped public “booster” shots Let explain - we're taking actions protect others, opposite.

History judge fellow ignorant, selfish kind accordingly.   understand people reading Delta somehow renders vaccines ineffective. nearly effective prior strains. difference mother fornicator much infections, going butt excavate lot people lot faster. result it'll sweep breakthrough cases. lack efficacy, buttload cases unvaccinated group.

The end game vaccinate entire world. simply going take time. can't pull vaccines a$$holes, we? No, would require vaccine trial, kinda. evidence points good effectiveness vaccines variants. 

Given virus variant come somewhere, area decent coverage vaccines, vaccines clearly reduce spread, issue. Definitely need 11 people replying fucking thing. Give guy break.  wow man. cant use rational thinking skills sub matey... 

BAN HERETIC!  Yeah, way less people two hours inland well. high uptake populated areas still carry state high overall numbers even pockets low uptake. generally viewed likely vaccinated eventually get it.

I'm sure, could way. Pandemics end, them. world build enough immunity make virus ""non-issue"" one way another. define ""non-issue"" lot different things. Keep mind current vaccines still highly effective we're wresting lack efficacy vaccines, enough people taken vaccine.

Lastly keep mind needed alter vaccines tailor Delta strain. stands right now, yet necessary. important keep high level perspective. We're currently prognosed peak fall that's 20% last year's peak, that's worst case scenario. great, definitely progress year year.  I'm ish 806 people infected Delta variant ended hospital England 1 February 14 June 527 (65%) people 135 (17%) 21 days first dose 84 (10%) 14 days second 14 June, 73 deaths England people confirmed Delta variant died within 28 days positive test, 34 (47%) 10 (14%) 21 days first dose 26 (36%) 14 days second dose

These actually encouraging figures. keep mind demographics two doses vastly different zero one.

Those aged 50+ high-risk health conditions previously represented 80% hospitalisations 99% deaths pre-vaccine waves. [As (page 10), vast majority doubled-dosed individuals far group (most 50 haven’t received second dose yet).

The fact people two doses make 10% hospitalisation 36% deaths (rather something much closer 80% 99%) great news. fact, 2 doses vaccine [have 92%+ effective preventing hospitalisation Delta far (after properly accounting age, clinically vulnerable groups, ethnicity week test). conspiracy theorists. understand people possibly think youre right side history... get less lethal info? don’t believe you, hadn’t heard before. breaks heart… likely homeschool coming year area anti-mask I’m pretty certain masks optional kiddos. meant aren’t artificial wombs such. trying funny, hard feelings. Though believe worth getting worked over, wearing mask one around completely useless. makes feel safe, one stop them. wish could opt updates 6 year old day camp summer desperate see kids. literally kid wearing mask, least 30. know anyone said anything him, he's made decision going wear decides safe, really care others think.

m: milli, 10^-3

μ: micro, 10^-6 People still listen fool? Cyanide thank you!!! Far kind. natural concerned new medical treatments.

What people worried ought look incredibly thorough extensive process place ensure treatments are, generally speaking, safe general populace.

There's good reason vaccines widely available back September, example, even though actual methods well-understood working science it. go rigorous testing significant number real humans approved. 

It's like came vaccine said ""hey, try shit"" sold pharmacies. That's works. went well-defined human trials first, specifically look side-effects people worried about. 

People say vaccines ""untested"" well-understood know fuck talking about. Might already that. K417N mutation noted increased transmission resistance vaccination. Somebody want able researched, said elephant room. Part localised testing surge happening. example first ever COVID test nhs testing area(hounslow, current hotspot).The test done door door. targeted compared previous waves. Professor here.

Meh DC 69.5 according site. Wow that’s amazing news! Wonder get lockdown so? still significantly measurable increase safety wear correct type mask. I'll wearing one children vaccinated, even vaccine, still 15% chance contracting it. please state position masks theater, I'd glad go around circles one, let's quoting whole, “

More evidence needed use different COVID-19 vaccines children able make general recommendations vaccinating children COVID-19.

WHO's Strategic Advisory Group Experts (SAGE) concluded Pfizer/BionTech vaccine suitable use people aged 12 years above.

Should start wearing mask inside places? wrong tangent here. I'm addressing people reluctant, I'm addressing anti vaxxers. That's massive difference. course careful consider benefits risks. directly refusing vaccines reasonable, religious reasons besides medical reasons. describe medical reasons.

Also, another reason wrong tangent... I'm us. I'm German actually working healthcare system. None cases describe would result financial problems patient. That's system. everything fine healthy, need anything. moment shit hits fan, life f*cked without health insurance. Insurances situations things okay, that's absence system based pure egoism. Here, pay get unlucky. That's fair.

And pay based income have, get treatment (unless use private insurance, much expensive overall, mostly addresses convenience things, like room hospital alone, another patient). That's also fair. even upper limit, debate fair not, think fair treatment costs already covered (average).


Another thing apparently realize: scientist doctor (particularly involved studies) tell ""there complications"", know what. add ""that know of"".

We’ll probably move away enough us get burned didn’t necessary knowledge context evaluate data.  try talk lol paying attention health effects going Covid-19?

That's way live life. can't vaccine take that's problem point. Phase 3 data looks good.

Pandemic fatigue ""personal freedom"" [1], misinformation online certain political officials media.

Additionally, CDC advice vaccinated people could wear masks inside outside harmful. given unvaccinated people excuse wanted ignore pandemic. unvaccinated people regular vaccinated people people mistakenly get impression pandemic over.

Also worth noting, judgmental wife told definitely going get vaccine became available. Definitely gave us eye roll, side eye, judgmental smirk. snarky self righteous. think there’s imprecision phrase “get it.“ vaccine can’t prevent exposed virus, therefore virus way interact body systems. vaccine gives body ability fend well. could mean anything best-case scenario, effectively virus doesn’t “do“ anything all... two situations virus around detectable, symptoms… causes symptoms, you’re sick… very, rarely could still get sick.

And along this, chance giving virus someone else proportional much carrying moment. obviously much, much less vaccinated, never zero. practice, don’t really need worry vaccinated people much spreading virus, technical sense possible.

Belgium (and guess goes EU) covid-passport (which allows vaccinated people travel EU without PCR tests/quarantine) shaping major reason doubters getting vaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

A second big reason large number people vaccine quite widespread long term adverse effects found far. also helps convincing doubters vaccins safe.

The die-hard anti-vaxxers almost impossible convince though. Flu vaccines pretty low barrier. basically useless unless fragile working fragile.

Yep, vaccine readily available now. people don’t physically can’t get they’re immune compromised, don’t want number reasons. 

If don’t want it, you’re eventually going catch COVID hard way. We’re getting herd immunity one way another.

That's waiting side effects never showed up. them, long enough since first shots, believe they're safe.  news reporting hospital cases non vaccinated people. unvaxxed point probably never believed wearing masks first place.

Germany would recommended get vaccinated even Covid ensure comprehensive immune response. suggest waiting 6 months covid infection - could local requirement. Check doctor local authority find recommended you. problem vaccine protects hospitalization death, good, even mild version turn long covid end sight. Additionally, still spread it. kid's vaccinated yet. can't be. found vaccine safe kids yet. know they're working it, act like I'm going murder children bringing home damn anti-vaxxer. That's said ""had bad reaction covid"". I'm counting people actually covid. People unvaccinated never covid represented statement. Well, probably wear masks rest life, flu equally deadly two year olds, that's vaccination.  Driving kid school necessary growth development. 

Not getting vaccine risking Covid unnecessary. 88% thought efficacy number, right? 

lets round 90%. means 10 unvaccinated people would gotten symptomatic COVID, instead 1 unvaccinated person would. 

For me, that's great, still want hang around bunch infected people indoors without mask anything. lots Darwin awards Given lower per capita deaths US average course pandemic, aren’t well helping Covid win, then. see west/east divide. Pretty much EU countries range 35-55% vaccinated people. However two big outliers - Romania (25% vaccinated) Bulgaria (13%, yikes!). even Poland 44% Hungary 56% clear west/east divide. countries reason failed convince population vaccinate. Could Go Wrong? true, COVID-19 around less 2 years. number still pretty scary. Either way deaths preventable. Well one thing, mutation could part SPIKE protein isn’t involved binding target (like ACE2 receptor lungs). RNA would still different, maybe different vaccine RNA vaccine won’t effective, domain protein responsible binding lungs releasing viral RNA would unaffected, transmission would still possible.

Another way could happen is, depending specificity ACE2 receptor, binding portion spike protein actually could change, it’s possible would still bind lungs also RNA would different enough vaccine work. universal flu shot? would awesome! Heh, try 😁 Unfortunately assessing risk, lot people give “extreme events” exceptions weight without considering rare are. cause something risky like take vaccine scared possible heart inflammation. 95% efficacy means 20 unvaccinated people would gotten symptomatic COVID, instead 1 would. 

For J&amp;J certain variants, like 5:1. 

So even vaccinated people probably hanging indoors without mask place high community spread virus. US work culture bad compared Europe, Japan worse US many ways (working hours, etc.). ""But COVID, pneumonia!"" Vaccinations aren’t cause problem. It’s people esp America created arbitrary goalposts pandemic tend revolve around unrelated things want like “the school year” “nice weather” “summer vacation” “the economy” Weird got vaccine live like 2019. Please tokenize us. US worries me. Facebook Google show scientific sounding anti vax propaganda ""recommended videos"" people. get youtube page recommendation anti vax propaganda. Esp mRNA inventor video.

Then also propaganda certain group (there essential oilers too... ones bigger). Ironically political senate state leaders party vaccinated. want subjects vaccinated, idea why.

So point carrot stick work, limited extent. not? tons kids outside everytime run errands. risk children tiny. can, won't. Lapd even prohibit cops guns drunk let go cars? Cross roads? Yeah. lived Massachusetts, would worried 3 year old live Alabama. think that's true most, exceptions. severe tinnitus (ringing ears) makes difficult function sleep times, even causing suicidal thoughts. people reported tinnitus worsen vaccine. me, worth making worse, especially tinnitus seems (maybe hopefully fully) getting better very, slow rate.

I guess maybe could fairly still classified coward, think valid reason get vaccinated (at least now). I'm comparing minuscule odds getting covid vs minuscule odds adverse reaction.

There covid case within 100km me, year. let's say control community transmission, i.e. first wave lockdown, using see cases per million local government area, LGA's surrounding me. number order magnitude XXX per million. That's absolute worse case, takes **total** cases, across entire pandemic region.

The order magnitude Pfizer adverse events order XX per million. put another way, getting covid 10x likely. 

However simple since: 

* government would lock us well got there. 
* Currently state consider outbreak, 42 active community cases, **but** delta strain, spreads far easily dealt before. Well look UK, really. uptick cases (which still pretty low) seem much data many new cases vaccinated, new cases vaccinated percentage symptomatic percentage severe enough need hospitalization. full quote headline derived from: ""The Delta variant clearly going another wave. decide get vaccinated, virus still find you,"" Osterholm said. is. toss 300k doses received came plant Baltimore.  someone give us condensed version need know new delta plus mutation? Good day everyone, question couldnt find good info, anyone know effective coronavac/sinovac vaccine delta variant? country used vaccine one found Pfizer one efectiveness Save it! case levels area?

I'd still wearing masks public indoor spaces virus circulating lot am, despite vaccinated. 

Luckily, almost cases many people gotten vaccinated. antivax made choice. 

The incentives nudged lazy undecided. Immunocompromised individuals (ranges levels risk) live like bubble person like many now. example, blood cancer patients went chemo cancer remission immunocompromised COVID stay inside extent- would avoid things like concert. even vaccination need wear mask, distance take precaution. Source? work within healthcare system. latest Covid update email stated 99.5% new cases 2021 unvaccinated people. science clear. everything avoid it. wish speedy recovery! Strong beliefs, loosely held. recommend keep kids safe? stay home turn 12? always go Facebook without knowing block certain accounts follows. think issue has, well, inaccurate extrapolation data subsequent reporting media outlets, leads public bombarded conflicting information. you’ve noticed, whole thing experts rarely made declaratory statements without making sure science behind robust (well, except couple don’t listen much), wasn’t hold off

But you’ve got news outlets, like NYT, WaPO way heads reporting neutralization assays, CD8/4 responses bunch stuff drawing completely wrong conclusions lack training understand things, ultimately actually want clicks attention, bulletproof science. that’s even touching places like Fox alternate reality. 

Im immunologist, I’m pretty familiar lot “science” reported on, it’s painfully obvious news outlets don’t know they’re doing. Flip flopping constantly stuff like “vaccines great”, “variants ruin vaccines” explicitly harmful public health, especially see latter often based news outlet taking study completely context drawing wrong conclusions, even worse example like NYT reported New York variant leaked, unfinished paper Columbia university. 

So don’t issue experts established science data changing. doesn’t anything bad, harmful reporting. fully vaccinated, COVID much less deadly flu. Yes, variants too. mRNA vaccines incredibly effective.

The reality nothing changes US. next several years US 50% vaccinated. COVID continue spread. hospitals overrun there’s reason lockdown. People making choice. incredibly stupid choice, America about. hasn’t approved Canada, either. don’t currently approve mixing form due current lack data. (Indeed, countries currently mixing mRNAs, completed studies it, entirely alone one)  New York... Florida singled out? That’s excellent. Thank sharing this.  I’m glad live Massachusetts. came whopping 63 cases yesterday. one masking much high vax rate. feels like it’s here. apply logic areas life, though, justify driving child around car engaging everyday activities carry much higher risk death covid infection? like meme.

Millions people dead COVID globally..... SLEEP

A small number people experience rare side effect vaccine (that appears resolve cases).... REAL SHIT. Truely pathetic. That’s awful. USA Weekly Case Change: -12% 127 202 = 62% 
USA Weekly Death Change: -12% 132 202 = 65% 
Both ahead worldwide average. That’s totally valid, can’t find data 16+ population specifically 16 17 year olds. Either way values approximate, it’s still majority. percentage people bad reaction vaccine still less percentage people bad reaction covid.

&amp;#x200B;

That's correct way looking get vaccine, 100% got vaccine don't, 100% likely get COVID. 

On hand, vastly underselling difference anyway. vaccines incredibly, stupendously, gigantically less likely hurt COVID. Also something never thought recently: needle phobia real. saw many news videos people getting stuck. overly afraid needles every time seemed unnecessary. Like, come on. know needles work. Quit close shots people getting stuck. I’m sure greatly affected needle phobia folks. vaccinations working delta variant? can’t grow pig’s ears, either. NOW!!! Yeah bad article will. Tears laughter. Thank you, well put. drastically altering life multiple years avoid something ""easily avoidable""? dying car crash thanks seat belts ""easily avoidable"". nothing last year easy. Bolsonaro actively everything stop lockdown, administration vaccines use masks. defunded (even more) Brazilian public healthcare system, surprisingly great history conducting mass immunization. reports last year Pfizer tried reach government 80 times never heard response. find search “CPI da Covid” It’s cause vaccinations, that’s don’t give fuck give example gambling child’s life? Like driving car, car seat airbags stuff?

Feeding food could choke on? gambles?   point natural selection work. decide get vaccine, risk death. Honestly lot people holding country back anyway huge loss. Right - vaccines 5 year, 10 year, 20+. Influenza needs annual vaccines rapid rate mutation, immune response fades fast. see someone say that, always wonder spent even second actually think it. 

COVID kill enough people real sort ""natural selection"" effect. consider death rate reproductive-age people..... mean...come on. Guess continue stay home socially distance simple. Vaccinations (and restrictions) work community level. really *anyone* *everyone*. mono college campus immunocompromised state almost tanked academic career. Thanks telling immunocomp person feel. wouldn’t call 80th 200 better 60% might check math one tho.

Your point still would worked without made number. Many states low hundreds cases per day right now. One family friend’s parents friend died covid getting least one, doses. 

That also India though. feels disingenuous take deaths worldwide, ask people US alone trending back normal. India ate shit really hard, situation? Ohhh absolutely has. Billionaires made like thieves time. Meanwhile, small business’ closing country (United States me, I’m sure true world), hundreds thousands jobs lost, top unemployment benefits running out. shit storm continues grow 

Edit: sprinkle rising homelessness, housing crisis, crime whole left vs right cold civil war brewing we’re looking abysmal future right states. lot people terrible assessing abstract threats. see someone sick dying registers real threat.

This would also apply anyone recently moved American southwest somewhere like Florida keys surprised extreme climate events. people also need understand get hospitalized covid going getting stuck LOT needles get vaccinated. sound frustrating many different directions changes schedule. 
I really hope none face issues travelling two mRNA vaccines mixed.  I’m psychic dude. You’re stubborn sake argument. medical treatments potential side effects. expected vaccine brand new. Maybe chance low, maybe side effects. pretend isn’t possible naive. look world, even government pushes something says bla bla bla safe. Yeah they’re probably right sometimes aren’t. decision put body. Hence decided get vaccine, didn’t certainly would gotten COVID likely way dangerous Ironically, delta variant contagious.

Dramatic rises infections nearly always followed dramatic declines. seems delta variant able spread population quickly India followed pattern smaller countries done.

Brazil followed American pattern, size country means get big rises falls national scale, although get regional scale. delta variant came along, India also followed pattern certain degree. think benign reason: think lot people actually really scared corona virus denying, become anti-vax way coping fear. 

It's unreasonable people respond like this. think people pretended something problem lives rather deal it. Corona major impact people living lives short period time must freaked people lot. people want face fear end denying deflecting. Excerpt: Delta variant may twice transmissible conventional strain.

Granted, think people exactly running headlong letting toddlers kids teens catch COVID risk side effects emergent immediately apparent like post-polio syndrome referring phrasing “hurry start jabbing them”. Maybe read much able choose  Source: June 14, 671 deaths fully-vaccinated individuals, 122 (18%) 671 cases reported asymptomatic related COVID-19. Sinovac sinopharm did. apologize one shot strategy, one shot good enough Delta. Also started vaccinating 30 year olds long ago. going say sure, that’s case throughout pandemic, actually don’t know children past isolated due restrictions schooling things relaxed. 

Anyway, yes agree comparatively children becoming infected year ago. Whether that’s due vaccinations, socialization vs restrictions, and/or new variants, I’m sure. misunderstand.

I replying person equated ""risk"" vaccine risk COVID, completely idiotic. Perhaps meant reply person misunderstood message.

My point vaccines millions times safer catching COVID. idiot replied seems think vaccines dangerous. It’s literally article situation that’s become political. supposed source “a non-political” article situation made political ? plain censoring, limiting reasonable discussion. R-value 1 exponential increase, easily happen heavily vaccinated regions well, UK Portugal. long stays 1 real question. Maybe vaccinations catch it. many people really don’t want end sort selfish catharsis. need feel morally superior us brain got vaccinated. idiots listen past year made nothing worse..., problem now. Good luck. exist would mandate vaccines. Yeah, think exactly correct. also 2 year old take many precautions mention. many hot takes subreddit seem assume activities situations comparable, risk COVID every age group same.

In theory sounds solid, legitimate field hell field legitimize fact-free stance husband? Sounds like quack. approaching 100% effective severe COVID death. Also, it’s extremely effective doesn’t mean aren’t breakthrough cases. know two different people covid despite vaccinated, transmitted via people also vaccinated — people unlucky, suppressed immune system, whatever else.

Even though I’m vaccinated, don’t think could live shed virus someone else got sick, transmitted unprotected kids. 90yo family friend died recently 2 weeks getting COVID vaccine. aunt posted Facebook died due shot. decided leave part found stage 4 cancer couple months ago *actually* killed him. wonder much men generally great self care. husband vaccinated, he's anti vax. would book appointment remind it?

You see men heart attacks too, married men live longer wives force go doctor follow-up care. Heard one. hope approved soon, sake. Cases continue decline week week.  need permission anyway right ? minor. there's much apart trying convince them. ask get vaccinated ? People seriously WANT live rest lives locked wearing masks. Let us make decisions!!!!! probably won’t give shit cases around heart issues younger people. I'm pretty science-minded parent little kids, feel like we've lost minds here. There's lot data risks covid young children, they're pretty low. I'm worried we're creating generation kids social psychological issues attempt protect something dangerous them.

We make personal decisions regard risk, parent 4 year old needs support social development, there's way I'm keeping isolated kids vaccination. taking account adults population? Say group 6 unvaccinated people, 4 vaccinated (which real ratio atm). case majority deaths likely unvaccinated people, weather vaccine effective not.

What would tell something efficacy *number deaths among vaccinated* vs. *the number deaths among unvaccinated*. already done course that's proved high efficacy vaccine, can't conclude title particular article. enough people get poke Israel considering closing vaccinated Israelis may quarantine Delta? Something right. Florida. you, Pappy? Thank absolutely right. make harder see kids, one coming us week we're trying figure see one. Well maybe let ten thousands together arenas .... i'm minor, im sure would mad something without permission deaths decline. SC less 150 COVID cases per day statewide, dropping, peak 5000 per day.

Given observational nature data, estimates vaccine effectiveness need interpreted caution.


As wrote earlier, don’t get hung vaccine percentages. Yup. I'm pregnant wanted data first, soon data released babies born antibodies virus scheduled mine week. Melbourne certainly lot.of restrictions lockdown last year.

I think retail usually closes Australian lockdowns. Entertainment generally (eg cinema) pubs restaurants switch take away. time parks exercise closed one time Adelaide copped lot flak changed it.

In Sydney generally lock down. there's outbreak capacity limits venues, restrictions many people house, masks introduced settings. cares people ‘deserve’ illness? Elected officials can’t allow mass spread infection, breaks society.

The real choices absence voluntary vaccine acceptance forced vaccinations sort rotating restrictions cases rise (masks, etc.).

I’m sure sub finds hard understand. sister pretty bad 2 months towards initial outbreak, major lung scarring still struggles breathe sometimes. One best friends well also it, passing work one day found basically heart someone 80’s. She’s even 30. It’s scary shit. fairly mildly, losing taste energy, months later still get totally fatigued construction work used able go day problem. haven’t reached herd immunity we’ve always herd ignorance. data heavily skewed towards larger total January/February. problem vastly less right vaccines, borne continually falling Covid deaths, well fraction daily new cases. wear mask places still, otherwise one wearing anywhere. still wear dispensary (cancer patients etc), super market, restaurants.  social issue. Bingo !  efficacy can't confirmed, correct. transplanted patient looks quite bad honest. safety confirmed huge amount real world data. japan vaccination problem? Technically science 95% back. Pretty good tho. Nobody talking taking “large doses” ivermectin, whatever means FDA doesn’t even provide number claim people talking about.

Again, point legitimate discussion allowed, discussion falls within category accepted discussion.

Which case claims discussion ivermectin immediately shut linked entirely different drugs don’t work dangerous.

If ivermectin proven work treat covid, vaccines wouldn’t approved EUA, cannot safe alternative order approval.

This simply illogical way view strategy fighting ending pandemic, reason limit one method treatment multiple methods treatment available used. 

The current accepted view vaccines treatment killing people needlessly, causing harm needlessly.

If limiting spread virus, none would objection immediate exploration alternative treatments, seems become validation identity. It’s unreal  training cosmetology school 99% cops. embarrassing.   German RKI (our CDC) still says close contacts VOC patients (except B.1.1.7) must quarantined matter vaccinated recently convalescent wild-type/other VOC.

RKI says still enough evidence rule breakthrough infection due VOC B.1617.2, P.1 B.1351. didn’t get cold social life year half. That’s fucking sustainable, honestly would rather get cold times year wear mask work. approaching masked person, feel respectful wear one see another person wearing one (they're obviously concerned reason, maybe they're immunocompromised something).

This great. mask mandates Canada still, find leaving I'm walks stuff cause pandemic showed need go 1-2 steps deep find someone kid 1, going chemo, autoimmune, otherwise vulnerable, find minor inconvenience actually becomes inconvenient take put leave whole time. Unless get vaccinated within next week, around unvaccinated people fully vaccinated return school fall. longer offering remote learning.  Yes no. Well yea case. coworker irrationally scared vaccine. knows it’s irrational can’t anything really. understand that. There's thing natural immunity un-alived... whole thing could completely avoided whole country went lock 3 months starting last March. 

Not really. Countries Europe strong lockdowns squash covid spring summer saw surge back fall. I’ve definitely learned trust lot fewer people this. hear ya. benefit vaccinating young men already covid outweigh risks vaccination? Thanks think accurate way put would ""the pandemic longer affects me."" Saying ""the pandemic me"" makes sense linguistically, definition word ""pandemic,"" can't ""over"" based one person's experience it, someone feels way, suggests world view self-centered. vaccines drastically reduce chances catching spreading Covid, even mild cases. Quick question, US say get first dose Moderna, cant get second one 8 weeks later, 4 like advised, would people applying vaccine let get shots? would prohibit getting vaccinated make smart decisions social distancing, problem you. Bahaha almost like extremes ends bad. hunger infectious disease? young person made massive social sacrifices. lived alone entire pandemic rebuild career opportunities ground up. I'm sure assuming otherwise. people get it, less effective. 

My mother-in-law leukemia, crazy cocktail drugs result. got vaccine (Pfizer) doctor told like 50% effective immune system basically broken point. told around unvaccinated people without mask. Yes, are.

How exactly seeing “long term” side effects working?

Five years line magically get side effect? How, mechanistically, would work?

Once vaccine reagents system immune response done, could cause side effect? biggest difference US UK UK gave 1 shot people US higher percentage fully vaccinated much longer. Sure, % covid Delta increasing US, matter total cases decreasing.

Being fully vaccinated better protection precaution. half people state fully vaccinated, continuing precautions environment low still decreasing cases would crazy. US dropped drastically vaccines readily available. headline really really sucks considering take anything date consideration fully vaccinated myself, yet (Canadian) first thought ""well, maybe that's little far""

Then remembered minor inconvenience wearing mask me. hey, walk staircase without gasping air, makes sense really care unvaccinated adults point, delta variant affect children 12 cannot get vaccinated? latest data suggests children remain decent chunk COVID cases miniscule proportion bear delta variant you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said Delta variant. “If you’re vaccinated, you’re hosed.”

Tell 8 10 year old students (siblings) elevated heart rates lung scarring ""mild"" COVID cases last year. think people started forgetting potentially dangerous stuff world became focused covid. mention huge toll took people's mental health, growing concern many people. Quality life suffered, cant pretend doesnt matter. said, cant force people get vaccine (although concern many people refuse get one, somehow mandated enforced one way another) Agreed, responding comment explicitly stated that:

“the point acting like pandemic ‘over’ longer affects personally suggests entire worldview revolves around yourself”

I reacting mentioned regarding correct nomenclature describe vaccinated person going normal life pandemic indeed still exists. Instead responding implication made somehow bad feel way. also say personality thing involved here.

Yet. people idiots increasing risk worse variants. I'm pressed it. comment replied even mention kid wearing mask. understand reasoning ""kids died gambling kid one million hard pass"" undoubtedly gamble kid's life time. Exactly. I'm fully vaccinated still wear mask since four year old two year old home. “The UK surpassed Israel, long-time leader Covid vaccination, higher percentage Britons received first dose.

Britain, overtook Israel Wednesday, given first dose vaccine 64 per cent population, including 80 per cent adults. compares 63.7 per cent Israelis initial dose.”

“In Israel, 59.6 per cent population second dose Covid vaccine. UK, stands 46.7 per cent, 31.9 million Britons second dose.” must really spooked variant they’re also bringing masks back. everyone gets COVID winds long lasting respiratory problems

That's me. Can't speak broader population, speak personal anecdote. year since COVID. I've gone hiking **few dozen** times since (most recently Sunday short loop Organ Mountains), even **year** later lung capacity stamina shot. 2-3 mile hike mild elevation change would classified Easy-Moderate limit. days 10-12 mile full day hikes half mile elevation change over. 

Earlier 2020, could pass staying-inside-out-of-shape. can't say year later, multiple exhausting shorter hikes several weekends. appears new normal lungs handle. gotten goosebumps nowhere, apparent reason? so.. licked No, people warning variants do.

We're getting closer point we'll play catch vaccines again. Unless cancer. they'll put sunscreen smoking cigarette indoors BAIT HEADLINE Everybody thread: ""Derp, what's long covid?

Let’s gooo! 🚀 Something keep mind , dangers heart inflammation kids getting Covid significantly higher. 

The reactions vaccine mild quickly resolved , addition extremely rare. Israel sophisticated vaccine passport system. Anecdotal India children super affected second wave small minority affected (severe symptoms deaths). would say kids probably get hosed careful.

That's messed up.

There also Jurgen Conings... wild ride say least.

And otherwise still sciencephobiacs like Dries van Langehove share adherence. ""Why clickbait headline scaring everyone?""

&amp;#x200B;

In US, every day people get vaccinated, infection rate, hospitalization rate, death rate steadily falling. headline clearly worded give opposite impression. Fuck CNBC. three look runny nose, headache, sore throat

So, cold symptoms. Could beginning COVID virus mutating something infectious less deadly?

I've read hypothesized OC43 coronavirus, one viruses responsible common cold, could cause 1889 Russian Flu pandemic. course OC43 mild annoyance. Maybe that's direction virus headed? come clear data yet vaccines perform regard reducing transmission? Water water everywhere drop drink So, people died ""world"" question focuses US...where people died 2021 vs 2020 daily deaths, 7 day moving average, March 2020 levels.

This saying 'figures lie liars figure' exists. This. Plus, 50% positive cases Israel vaccinated best estimate (the article links says estimated 40 50%), there’s info whether “vaccinated” people fully vaccinated, there’s info symptoms saying seem mild vaccinated. 

I’d also like know genesis positive results; coming mandatory tests (like work) picking asymptomatic “cases” really could it’s somebody’s nose they’re getting sick maybe even infectious. There’s heck lot information missing claims, think it’s purposefully sensational report little context (nothing new obviously).
 
Tldr, let know vaccinated people getting severely ill hospitalized. I'll darned one hand could lead bias, other, going value accurate decision making highly. Wrong heard physicians professional groups advising people get vaccine white count low. live attenuated vaccine would contraindicated, covid vaccine that. may good immune response, some. MS unlikely cause low white count get response vaccine. actually preventive measure? evidence asymptomatic fully vaccinated people wearing masks preventing anything? looks like Minister guessing article. glimpse Israel's Delta variant spike: Israel HMO Maccabi says 244 members tested positive. 61% fully vaccinated, 60% *them* suffering symptoms. 2 hospital.  among 39% vaccinated tested positive, ZERO symptoms.

So maybe they're talking symptomatic infection? Either way, small number, much less statistical power reports UK larger populations. S/he failed calling people selfish changed argument semantics. article link isn’t even 100% numbers. One person says 40-50% cases vaccinated. Another person article says third. 

Meanwhile real world data UK mentioned shows it’s highly effective still. 

I’ll take real world efficacy numbers estimates without real data.  super interesting thread situation Israel [Early clinical evidence extremely almost like preventive measure.

No, no, that's crazy talk. fit narrative anymore media newer narratives Politics. Lifting quarantine requirements looks like bad policy decision delta cases rising everyone freaking it, actually look science, there's good reason require quarantine vaxxed.

I still know US requires negative test board flight states vaxxed. We're among first lift mask mandates, capacity restrictions return mostly normal, know we're still holding onto policy.   what's wrong using phrase ""for you?"" that's case. acknowledges pandemic still present, affect got vaccine. like they're saying ""pandemic over"". browse rather anonymously YT first thing encountered among ~8 top videos: antivax propaganda.

Only thing downvote videos report fraud one options. Vaccinations recent trend. year worse last year (in US) worst months record January - March. also better/lower numbers basically time \~March 30th 2020... many us vaccinated - time get back there. 48% young people gotten vaccinated, really say correlates conservatism?

Also, I'm disappointed subreddit. voted? become new normal?  respect answer, upon reflection find agree. Agreed, think going challenge times, specially atom bomb disinformation (deepfakes) looming horizon.

But fair, people \*really\* dumb want hear. mean, people understand asymptomatic means. There's much communication do. also able deny coverage people engage dangerous activities like football riding motorcycle? Covid causes myocarditis well MIS-C kids.  got first shot, felt like huge weight lift shoulders. glad fully vaccinated. hope various vaccines stay effective coming variants. starting think unvaccinated walking Petri dishes. chances happening covid still much higher among vaccinated.

Are people going continue quarantines, lockdowns, masks, etc... point majority world going like ""fuck it, we're opening everything (including borders), we'll live it""?  everyone's different family knocked like 30hrs.. Ooh yuck, antivax ignorance. No, older children partially vaccinated already spread much within schools within families. That's difference slow rise exponential surge know case fatality rate COVID, what's rate COVID survivors long-term complications?  said it...

4.3% total population fully vaccinated. Damn government really fucked up.

You know fully vaccinated? every single politician. Fucking Muppets. Well right, 500M deaths acceptable amount now.      macabre sounds, overall deaths Covid US likely little effect worker shortage. Even million deaths would small amount overall population, nearly enough cause worker shortage alone. Factor large proportion deaths 60 plus range (people either retired close retirement), argument holds even less weight.

The worker shortage due many factors, including Covid done society, deaths big cause worker shortage. It’s everything else happening country. fact children 12 (in US) going back school ton un-vaccinated children close proximity?  Use brain.

What worker shortage result Covid deaths? studies suggesting actually 900 thousand, maybe million now.  We're taking whether right freely access societies services benefits granted someone willing bare minimum protect society. 

If we've hit herd immunity, yes, granted get vaccinated.  presentation available FDA website probably made evaluation data (it compared reported cases expected cases instance), anyway CDC basically also sharing official numbers myocarditis numbers, Moderna bit triggering, probably higher dosage intend isolating global population vaccinated?

My vaccine works mean pay infect customers. isn’t “going narrative”, it’s unnecessarily exposing vulnerable among us deadly virus. small percentage people cannot vaccinated also much likely go hospital. It’s also arguable don’t understand science around vaccines, you’re probably wrong field. People vaccinated reason we’re seeing variants. enough people opt out, eventually we’ll right back started. Literally going one basic amino acid another site may recognized antibodies… don’t think different Sorry got downvoted asking genuine question. Ha ha good, complete moron.  evidence needed use different COVID-19 vaccines children able make general recommendations vaccinating children COVID-19.

This different argument one you’re claiming making.

This current claim making **totally** different original claim.

Your original claim animal studies. are. correct run concurrently human studies - riskier **trial participants**.

They heroically took risk.

But change risk profile non-trial participants. normal safety measures needed passed EUA approval. excellent, I'm envious them, preclude tactic mask mandate. Best part one bit cases decreasing 2-4 weeks roll back again. essentially extra protection. bear mind seeing evidence delta variant may increased risk unvaccinated, including children, would protect too. 600,000 lives could saved governments world learned science started lockdowns day word broke.

Yes, know still huge problem around world, I've really done help control spread. Cases low US compared winter, think vaccinated, every right take back life now. We've already suffered, need prolong to. Florida, least, forbidding cruise lines requiring proof vaccination... 88% symptoms, probably means 80% infections.  huge population unvaccinated adults? covid going ignore winter rolls back around? 

Numbers went last summer too.. last winter hit.    lesser testing/more focused testing. numbers dwindle sick unvaccinated mostly people get tested. situation 10 unvaccinated people get tested 9/10=90% (juts example) seem like big deal.

As vaccinations ramp time focus different methodologies evaluating infection prevalance, Almost easy reading article, says Florida (where many cruise ships sail from) passed law prohibiting businesses requiring proof vaccination. Always think bright side. worry vaccines ever. Yuuge plus! That's research necessary here. Obviously there's ton know... And, ask me, researching year ago... finding virus targets brain.

I know family members likely know wanted mention juuuuust case. ❤️ national level statement may true; local level hospital capacity managed confident. Nothing bad last winter medical systems failed many parts US simultaneously could definitely impact care COVID non-COVID patients within regions. 

Keep mind bad flu seasons already strain hospital systems; COVID winter additive flu burden NPIs (rightfully) mostly gone. course, may expect light flu season due morbid ""population culling"" effect COVID well relatively low global spread flu strains right - may relief there. We're summer. 40 percent adults vaccinated likely be. 

When winter comes back, likely see surge areas low vax rates. 

If high vax rare area.. problem over. Okay? breakdown many new cases vaccinated partially vaccinated? Here's I'm worried: pandemic response proof if/when another serious pandemic similar threat emerges significant chunk population nothing whatsoever hinder spread. low expectations pandemic response started become politicized, results managed underperform even those. nefarious actor actually engineer bio-weapon response proven low bar required effect absolute catastrophe. equivalent showing enemy high definition one's entire military arsenal permanently unserviceable unfit purpose.

But... b-but you? go sure downvotes. It’s common sense seemingly. That's true, first dose. AZ second dose 3 months first, long wait second dose might make lot difference spread new variant. think got point can't believe explain this. 

You see, longer virus alive mutates. 

Now, thanks unvaccinated brain farts, might mutate enough affect vaccinated people. 

We back square one new type vaccines researched account new mutation. 

That could avoided everyone got fucking shot kill virus good. 

Now know insist everyone get vaccinated, brainless psychopaths included Yeah feeling effects right now, feels like big hangover far bad expected :) talking ass way ever attitude things important preventing deaths.

It's scary many people view. Paywalled unusual joint statement, top U.S. government health officials, medical organizations, laboratory hospital associations others stressed overriding benefit facts clear: extremely rare side effect, exceedingly small number people experience vaccination. Importantly, young people do, cases mild, individuals recover often minimal treatment,” statement said. vaccinated, expectancy hasn’t changed any, numbers rebound next year.

There huge swaths U.S. vaccination numbers low. imagine we're going years people vaccinated end measurably longer life expectancies unvaccinated similar demographics. assuming newer strains COVID go around like Delta variant vaccines effective them. said, vast improvements treatment COVID would expect overall positive impact mortality rates well. Still, adults refuse vaccinated, I'd expect life expectancy depressed. Many school districts making masks choice fall. big mistake? weren’t able see shit coming miles away.  That's simply true. Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna similar performance, also use similar mechanisms (both mRNA vaccines). AZ hand works quite differently (it vector vaccine), example much lower protection Delta variant one shot. believe fear mongering news sources tell believe TL;DR old conspiracy bullshit post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Young people unvaccinated group.

The delta variant makes 99% cases UK now. transmissible higher rates hospitalizations. twelve demographic increased naturally knowledge. good reason then? I'd certainly find justifying domestic restrictions 33 million (which vulnerable) people fully vaccinated, well 20 year olds single dose, quite hard honest. much? know.

That's true. know immunity pretty significant, even computed. percentage people contracting COVID-19 small. number people contracting COVID-19 dying almost zero. That's indicator strong immunity. almost like make numbers  mean we’re something like 70% vaccinated state 10% first dose? I’d guess you’re looking weeks 10% second dose businesses comfortable.

Read again. didn’t understand. Stop wasting people’s time pointless debate perspectives already presented.  What’s biggest reason hesitancy? FDA? Pfizer’s fine history?

I’ve read FDA approval one primary reasons many healthcare workers haven’t gotten it.

What else combatted specific facts? 

It’s true shame there’s still much info vaccines seems taking backseat shaming. 

The info N protein antibodies vs Spike protein seems omitted public eye. don’t scientists know long natural immunity lasts long mRNA antibodies last? isn’t info proper antibodies tests vaccinated people take? There’s lot underrepresented info feeling like lost opportunity rollout. even close July 4th goal. Get info out! Sorry worried. Glad choice continue wear mask like citizens choice to. Go Michigan! Efficacy correlated antibody levels, higher antibody levels necessarily mean higher efficacy. happens case. destroyed means destroying everything else fast possible.    si frustrating 11 year old right now, it! 11 year old also 5'4"" taller now, could easily pass 12 13 year old. wish could also maybe go body size comes kids. 11 year old aretiny, teenage size already forget new Delta plus variant noticed too. timeline kids getting vaccines fast enough. need approve immediately children protected. gonna get Delta+ GTR? think Australian government would quite willing got symptoms lmaooo. indoor gamer friend got mad sick. Anyone sauce one behind paywall? aware news without fear. CDC thinks 100 million Yeah help Fiji island nations. think might possible? /s Dont worry cant get autism twice. Wellllllll……yes, vaccine 100% effective everyone, still possible (but less likely, it’s survivable less severe) become sick even vaccine.

Not mention people legitimate medical reasons prevent vaccine.

Not mention people got vaccines available, etc etc.

Plus, that’s kind heartless…we balance (understandable) frustration antivaxxers compassion, we’d bad are.  coworker come ""testing negative flu"" feb 2020. I'd bet everyone place work exposed then.  ""we know"" argument used anything. open-ended becomes meaningless. Since 5G around 2 years old, know long term impact 5G human health. avoid 5G?  Delta variant postulated originated Nepal. isolated sample collected India back Sept 2020. Back Jan year talk double mutant later dubbed delta variant. 

At point isn’t anything much take vaccines continue preventive measures. it’s bad it’s made great. it’s worse delta another round lockdowns hopefully vaccines contain spread.

Personal protection byproduct main purpose. That’s absolutely fair. don’t make rest us fully-vaxxed people keep lives pause can. Hospitalizations deaths rising UK.

Thankfully much slower pace would without vaccines. new covid dlc Explain it’s twice effective please policeman job interact w/ public. +302 what? 12 weeks optimal (for highest efficacy second dose) AZ. need herd immunity.

I also doubt we'll ever achieve it. We're definitley yet UK we're ahead most. 

Get double vaxxed relax- give really good protection. Nothing else do.  apologies anyone living DC, PR, Guam, American Samoa, Palau, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, Virgin Islands, Native American Reservations removing list posting hell markel That’s really safety thing though Cause think shoot virus ""with gun""....  Kids gonna go school catch million colds. like 2019. downvoted YouTube stating facts? think important remember vaccine hesitant people ""I'm never gonna take it"" camp- hesitant means that, whatever reason. People NEVER take sure vocal, minority. Wishful thinking mentality Significantly fewer would without vaccines.

The evidence in. Double vaccines gives
 great protection delta full protection.

I doubt we'll ever reach heard immunity. transmissible vaccines good enough stopping spread.

The solution get double vaxxed. wear mask you’re fully vaccinated there’s next cases? I’m judging choices want understand rationale behind isolate. would even covid never existed. us J&amp;J folk get news booster supplementing Pfizer/Moderna? know still great protection, heard little news ""mixing"" vacccines. sucks J&amp;J thing available area long time. child two, going make wear mask till get vaccinated? doesn’t Iook like approved 12 soon waived long term efficacy.

...Hence fast tracked. you’ve chosen second explanation. Maybe actually wanted get vaccine while, double anti-vaccine stuff help justify earlier position. So, changing mind dime getting vaccine finally honest herself. cause something risky like take vaccine scared possible heart inflammation.

Or Tennessee anything go by, drive vaccination tent. parents compromised immune systems can’t get vaccine well. whole family vaccinated don’t worry us. Sorry read that. Genuinely. Ummm. I’m vaccinated. It’s rest world. 

But I’m simply…done. I’ve done part. 

In US, it’s problem refuse get vaccinated. That's still long way short 200 million estimate. always trust CDC compared random experts, people like Scott Gottlieb (great guy board Pfizer).

The goal vaccine us get hospitalized, despite that, even Delta, good protecting infection, cherry top. Nobody get stressed breakthrough infection (unless live super high risk people anyone unvaccinated).

Despite data showing so, always push news boosters. booster protects 10% more, people say needed, definitely optional certain groups really want it. Unless vaccines don’t work anymore, push boosters fishy. Explain exponential growth UK. majority US fully vaccinated. One dose curb delta infections large amount. Delta also shown higher rates fully vaccinated breakthrough infections. Nobody knows. There’s ongoing study UK mixing moderna/Pfizer another study thing enrolling Canada now. hope.

Edit: said lack recommendation due lack data hopefully studies go well eventually accept encourage countries let us in… knows Grandma vaccinated stay isolated. Kids spread effectively. Grandma take responsibility, pass 5 year olds.

Someone unvaccinated reason point much likely catch bingo night getting hair cut. I’m vaccinated. people don’t want take seriously get vaccinated can’t anything spend time worrying? can't. travel city procedure, over. due nature can't drive herself. honest suspect may due decrease asymptomatic testing (e.g. schools). testing symptom/contact driven, higher +ve %. time tell. misinformation comes anti-vaxxers.

That's soon became safe relax restrictions started pointing ""dangerous"" vaccines are. prolong make money. evil. Since idea read throughout pandemic sidestep pedantic comments exhortations.

As physician extremely well read area, tell categorically vaccines safe. Yes, alluded to, side effects, major. clear, literature supports, that, percentage gross numbers, vaccines cause significantly fewer adverse events covid causes severe illnesses deaths. denominator always critical data point. read 7000 breakthrough infections example, realize 7000 70 million (more now) puts things perspective. hundreds thousands people died country several million died throughout world throughout pandemic. numbers incontrovertible favor vaccination. End. vaccines, dispite media people scared air. vaccines great , variant vaccine resistant. hit 70% 80% vaccinated, green open normal. like fine, stay basement world move without you. Kids die cars airbags cars seats time. limited risk, erase it. Even unmasked kid safer covid safest car. mask them, bit safer still. understand it, fight government forcing something will. fighting protect individual rights. It’s different choice isn’t forced authority figures like doctors scientists politicians.

Many social activities recommend vaccination. Activities like yoga art classes suggest wear mask vaccinated encourage vaccinated go massless. life returning normal unvaccinated feeling left behind. can, course lie; say vaccinated. make feel?

It’s see Facebook experiencing real life that’s changing minds. happens quickly, dozens tiny social interactions single day. time interact someone new might ask back they’re mind, “could get COVID them?” perception risk quickly changes. another option, could get vaccinated.

Suddenly, needle prick doesn’t seem like big deal. Get shot, go back normal, stop worrying it. “they” made free will. us full arenas events open proof vaccination. require vaccination attend people worried. Even then, I’ve full capacity baseball games, zoos, whatever. It’s amazing many kids clearly 12 going around unmasked.  still get vaccine. made differently live weakened virus. lot people can't get flu vaccine get MRNA one. I’m glad mindset ability. Unfortunately, us live community high vaccination rates low cases. we’ll keep wearing masks kid get vaccinated. 👌🏻 limited edition version? lifetime support? backwards compatibility? able run Delta Epsilon? Thanks! best sense reliable vaccines are.  Exponential growth happens naive populations. Again, concern around Delta variant mainly centered low vaccination areas. Epsilon couldn’t outdo Alpha. Newer generations aren’t always best. know every disease different two family members autoimmune diseases (both immunosuppressants) got mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) side effects. understanding viral vaccines (traditional flu vaccines, J&amp;J, AZ) can’t used people taking immunosuppressants even “harmless” version virus used shots dangerous, mRNA completely different, new technology safe people live virus culture vaccines. know “healthcare workers”, include hospital staff janitorial food service.

I’m client’s office right can’t grab studies, vaccination among actual medically trained staff high - typically higher 90%. believe doctors vaccinated 93-96% sure everyone keeps bringing cars also wear seatbelt put kid car seat. It’s like vaccinating serious effects car wreck. example people MS specific issue.

&amp;#x200B;

what issue?

&amp;#x200B;

**People progressive MS,** older, higher level physical disability, certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart lung disease, pregnancy), Black Hispanic populations among groups highest risk hospitalization due COVID-19. Individuals **high-risk groups especially encouraged get vaccinated.**

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance People Living MS** guidance applies people MS ages 12 older vaccines authorized use age United States, Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna Janssen/J&amp;J. 
**People MS vaccinated COVID-19** 
The science shown us COVID-19 vaccines safe effective. Like medical decisions, decision get vaccine best made partnership healthcare provider. people relapsing progressive forms MS vaccinated. risks COVID-19 outweigh potential risks vaccine. addition, members household close contacts also vaccinated COVID-19 available decrease impact virus. 
***People progressive MS, older, higher level physical disability, certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart lung disease, pregnancy), Black Hispanic populations among groups highest risk hospitalization due COVID-19. Individuals high-risk groups especially encouraged get vaccinated.*** 
The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer BioNTech Moderna) require two doses need get doses maximally protected. vector vaccine (J&amp;J) requires single dose. Whether receive Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna J&amp;J vaccine, takes two weeks fully vaccinated considered protected. 
If you’ve COVID-19 recovered, also get vaccine. don’t know well protected people COVID-19 infection, long protection might last. People COVID-19 infection past get infected again. 
**The COVID-19 vaccines safe people MS** 
None available vaccines contain live virus vaccines cause COVID-19. vaccines likely trigger MS relapse impact long-term disease progression. risk getting COVID-19 far outweighs risk MS relapse vaccine. Learn mRNA vaccines (Pfizer BioNTech Moderna) vector vaccines (J&amp;J) work Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC). 
  
Any vaccine cause side effects, including fever. fever make MS symptoms worse temporarily, return prior levels fever gone. Even side effects, it’s important get second dose vaccine effective.  Staying houses ten years table, never table. misleading stat. see Covid knew enough PPE treatments. reality numbers way high advantages state enjoys (which includes warmer climate) Hospitalisations deaths moving fair bit honest someone ELI5 heart risk touted huge problem? Isn’t rare self-limiting/goes away own? Isn’t possible people get myocarditis flu infections never know? people acting like deal breaker? literally stance - fairly sure science behind vaccines, least principal, concerns safety vaccines given dramatically accelerated development testing cycles. want go first, knew countless millions would less reticent result, major problems would detected fairly quickly. 6 months later sure enough, right - vaccines quite safe first claimed changes vaccination programs made result (i.e. I'm Pfizer know governments intention give AZ), also showed actually looked risk, still low. POV means system worked. seeing mask mandates lifted think ok. That's exponential growth, sign California. described scenario assuming entire population naive virus. think concern Delta surrounding states regions low vaccination rates?  care little transmission risk healthcare workers patients. transmission unvaccinated staff patient results preventable patient death inexcusable.

way read bother understand anything said. Thanks pointless conversation. Exponential growth funny way. look like big deal is.  “long term side effects” don’t work way people seem think do.

What scientists mean “long term side effects” side effects last long time, pretty much seem thing COVID vaccines. 

What lay people seem mean “side effects show years later”, that’s really thing medication take twice. There’s causal mechanism it. Places like Japan Germany also imported bunch vile stuff internet RVVTF oral therapeutic drug assist us later year.  bull shit law. 

I bet overturned courts vaccines receive full approval FDA. Let’s hope happens. what? Nestle already bought water rights. makes hope though anyone else might thought saw change heart maybe stopped thought getting vaccinated themselves. I'm sure much wishful thinking someone anti-vax make post showing getting vaccinated seems like possibly good thing me.  real kicker that's preventing disease first place. efficacy hospitalization death still virtually 100 like every variant. well 1 person gives 2 people 2 people give 5 people 5 people give 8 people .... see upward trend concern ? .  


You get 500,000 deaths without 1 first case grows. stop driving right? Cause doesn’t drastically impact either right, deaths really low right now, assuming hospitalizations low well understand point Markel's statement. thing made lose weight finally getting antidepressants able break free self loathing cycle. isnt always divine moment, aware unhealthy terrible constantly sad anything it. That's typically around 40% effective, youre taking risk. Also, parainfluenzas? vaccine that. extremely contagious, cause pneumonia ultimately death, though exceedingly rare healthy baby die. again, healtht two year old dying COVID well. long term health issues concerning me.

Im trying attack here. Everyone risk assessment, think COVID put extreme edge. again, youre think best child, kudos that.

My mindset is- prevalence COVID extremely low community + majority people son encounters vaccinated + community high vaccination rate, Im going open life bit, benefits bringing kid world. 

But, again- judgement here. hope stay healthy safe. Ill read reply, wont respond we'll likely talk circles, haha. good day! Condensed version: get vaccinated. see many people saying choice getting vaccine, getting covid.

Why become locked way thinking?

There alternative treatment used variety different countries promising results, called Ivermectin.

I’m sure lot people heard it.

Respected, credentialed professionals field medicine whose careers line claims saying need paying attention Ivermectin.

We looking situation either/or situation either get vaccinated, catch Covid possibly die.

We looking many angles possible treatment methods possible using tools toolbox.

If people don’t trust vaccine, let take drug received Nobel peace prize, around decades, much cheaper, shown efficacy prophylactic use, reduction hospitalization use early stages Covid, even shown reduction symptoms long haul Covid.

Why earth wouldn’t look possibility further? Ivermectin needs testing/data, wouldn’t pursue it?

It’s already used successfully countries, would feel safe using it, US dictates cannot use safely administered countries, would choice believe motive behind isn’t trying end pandemic quickly possible. risk vaccinated people becoming infected virus low, still happen

The current data says order magnitude less likely youll get Covid youre vaccinated. IIRC least 20 times less likely catch it. data far shows mostly unvaccinated hit delta variant. overall efficacy lower delta cases, thing matters (preventing hospital deaths) still virtually 100% fair, inactivated viral vaccines lower side effects. Yeah, it’s easy skeptical vaccine say, December, virtually nobody gotten it, it’s distant thing you.

It’s whole thing virtually everyone know gotten vaccinated, they’re completely fine weeks months, you’re odd one everyone telling wrong Moderna delivered ~1m UK's early 7m contract (+10m later order, far I'm aware expected 'eventually'), hold breath getting time. folks aren’t vaccinated infected. got one shot far China’s vaccines (both Sinovac Sinopharm) inactivated. sure data suggests it’s threat children.

new data comes time.

&amp;#x200B;

you listen say, **see** what's happening places.

there NOTHING inherent US stop taking hold here.

&amp;#x200B;

ask Missouri.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spike cases prompts Freeman reopen COVID recently seen surge cases **fueled Delta variant**. One hotspots include Ozarks. According ***Missouri Department Health hospitalizations Southwest Missouri rose 196% last month.***  
Furthermore, says **'There yet enough evidence use vaccines COVID-19 children make recommendations children vaccinated COVID-19. Children adolescents tend milder disease compared adults.'** 


&amp;#x200B;

Israel highly vaccinated. they're closing schools again

**In 2nd school outbreak, 44 kids catch COVID — apparently Delta highly vaccinated - look who's testing positive.

**Youth, Delta variant behind UK COVID people behind surge, 5-fold **higher rate COVID-19 test positivity among children 5 12 years (0.35% prevalence) adults 18 24 (0.36% prevalence)** 65 older. **People younger 50 2.5 times likely infected older people** (prevalence, 0.20% vs 0.08%), although researchers noted infections seem growing comparable rate age-groups.

Less wealthy countries relying Covax, WHO’s vaccine-sharing initiative. Vaccine diplomacy also played significant part race secure supplies, although health experts raised questions effectiveness China-made vaccines. Vaccines work least Delta.

We're better country them. Funny thing she’s car seat go car. you’d like metaphor game: It’s kind like vaccinating really terrible side effects car wrecks. It’s guarantee survival, wouldn’t drive around without seatbelt back pick up. 🙃

Edit: typo mainly pandemic really get going March 2020? started clock 1 March 2020 (or whenever 1st deaths happened), would still saying thing 2nd year worse 1st? look Worldometer's graphs logarithmic view. see deaths (both US &amp; global cumulative) really start picking February 2020.

If 20 people got vaccine 10% bad reaction it, 20 people 10 people got COVID 20% got bad reaction it, number people bad reactions exactly same, despite difference rates.

Folks sick dying almost cases, unvaccinated. 2 cases yesterday 0 4 days that... example would picked Chick Fil breakfast kids. workers outside, one mask one approach car. put mine rolling window down. 

If go inside always me, cashier worker need help one on, put mine approaching them. 

In case walking next someone, put on, would stop next them. virus still find you. kill you. 

Good luck. Yep. Vaccinations. fact demand flatlined Week 2 general population availability there’s waiting list, 16 haven’t gotten least one dose now, that’s you. ages 12-15, talk parents getting vaccinated ASAP. 

Also, general consensus vaccinated, there’s much average citizen. Unless something comes around starts putting fully vaccinated people ventilators, there’s reason tell vaccinated Americans quarantine “stay home much possible”. vaccinated, covid *is* “dealt with” good data threat children. Remember, negative outcomes besides death.

On top benefit society (and kids) kids spreading less. Best guess: found within day someone liked/respected got coronavirus, possibly died it. vaccinated good immune system, pandemic pretty much over. wear mask required feel like someone would comfortable wore on. come go please. hug people again. go dates. 

All happened CDC said vaccinated people low risk even indoors without mask on. 

So yes, pandemic me. live smokers? coworkers go multiple smoke breaks daily, see people smoking bars (outside), restaurants, etc. still fairly common. Also trending better +60% countries. Past data means little context. word US might drop test requirement vaccinated citizens flying back US?

I trip Europe planned September test requirement return home making bit nervous, get false positive, legitimately test positive asymptomatic? I'd potentially spend two weeks hotel expense burn vacation time spare. is: government said worry anymore. win? great example FDA job. refused approve due lack evidence safety. shows FDA doesn’t approve stuff company wants to. Well example people MS specific issue. Canada that's 1 400 people. That's one group people MS. think safe assume people health issues also present low white blood cells. 

When say ""significant group"" mean 10% population. even 0.5% population, that's still significant group. Explain variant affects spike protein enough neutralize immunity would also neutralize method transmission virus Two reasons. election passed, cases/deaths near level hysteria began last March. Simple 

Because sick extending whole pandemic around antivaxer idiots don’t want protect 

Ontop still get Covid jabs doctors like fauci media loves remind scary titles articles gives impression jabs don’t work creating tons vaccine hesitation actuality extremely rarely effects 

So end goal 2 groups getting Covid quite frankly really thinking hard them

Now yes understand 0-12 cannot shots yet chances unless kid going come mind much, knows getting approved shots, well fact kids don’t really get sick Covid anyway 

immunosuppressed People? trying sound harsh don’t see massive issue go guys dragging forever 

So ask again, 4 groups mind, GOAL?? 150M figure includes teens, compare 200M adult population. imagine shape without vaccine. Hang there! specifically said vaccines given risk first. WORLD Health Organization, particularly applies places vaccines short supply. recommend 12 say data still younger kids, even yet approved.

There horrible side effects billions people getting medication be. I've CovidVaccinated no, wipe 80% posts, wiping posts telling people get vaccinated, pro vaccination subreddit acknowledges side effects thing side effects better COVID. kid lot higher probability dying covid 1 million gets it, seems like everyone unvaccinated get it.  2019 every year going forward Claims kids get severely ill high rates pretty much unfounded point. point point concern vaccine cause unforseen severe side effects general population- isnt data support theres basically null hypothesis. UK lower vaccination rate US. 1) thought yes man

2) worrying covid way reflects whether continues problem. determine ""significant group"" we're vaxed. source see say opposite Agreed. list, I’d also add UK focused vaccination efforts first doses, unfortunately vaccines (especially AstraZeneca, relied heavily on) really fully protective Delta variant received full course vaccine. UK reduced dosage window response, still operating 8 week lag, recent vaccination recipients won’t protected late summer. That's fair stance take suppose. There's difference cautious around brand new vaccine got fast tracked suspicious vaccines whole. get point think phrase harsh. 

I also think average person US can't much what's happening worldwide terms pandemic. best thing responsible Americans end pandemic get vaccinated. Every person brings less likelihood spreading virus next person may travel unprotected region. ""I can't it, want it""

It's teenage hating kids wearing ridiculously expressive brand clothing. (I would wear it, never buy it) talking worldwide US? it’s latter you’re making stuff up.

I’m young fully vaccinated. don’t worry Covid anymore. there’s variant road vaccine resistant I’ll start worrying again, hasn’t happened yet. anti vaxxer. already first dose AZ vaccine last month. hesitant side effects mean willing put everyone else risk. last paragraph true.

Substantial reductions SARS-CoV-2 infections (both symptomatic asymptomatic) reduce overall levels disease, therefore, viral transmission United States. However, investigations ongoing assess impact COVID-19 vaccination transmission.” vaccines supposed end problem?

Unless trying imply vaccines somehow effective solution? don‘t know Ya recent data. overall data much worse. 

USA 14th cases per capita considering counties tiny tiny nations take USA like 4th worst world COVID cases per population. 

The deaths bit better much. Something like 12-13th worst world remove tiny guys. Oh yeah, reason rebooked Italy 2 hotel vouchers expire end 2021. airfare booked points worst case they’re credited back. weren’t that, would chosen different country. Yeah health data say wants (not even getting many blunders questionable suggestions various health orgs made throughout whole thing) kids died gambling kid one million hard pass. mention colds norovirus going around. I'm Colorado husband brought home cold us coughing full mucous 10 days so. AWFUL. 100% worth taking mask off. wrongO think agree. years out. currently still issue.  I'm even sure JJ ever approved Canada tbh. Deaths higher November check going Israel proposing pretty common smokers well. It’s consequences now... either get vaccinated gamble life positivity rate decreased 0.2%. share feeling, can't understand cases low.

I think lack tourism explanation, detected delta variant time - true enough genome sequencing, clearly present spreading.

The vaccination status sad, indeed. people know vaccinated, notable exception parents law - simply want to, understand should. father law (in 80s) diabetes ""somebody"" told good idea take vaccine, diabetes. tried explain contrary, diabetes good reason vaccinate, can't convince him. that's situation almost everyone vaccinated. many vaccination, simply see reason it. Article behind paywall guys ridiculous. like people look headlines etc ask critical questions.

If watched CDC presentation yesterday said summary lot information provided heart risk first shot stats time. Also stated males higher rates it.

I think people focusing one 4 things opinion pro vax anti vax CDC still provide guidance

1. death rate higher seasonal flu 0-16 age group? flu harmful age group? mandate flu vaccine.
2. point 1 associated health risk young adults carriers? example accept risk pandemic? (they partly answered this)
3. females lower risk? concrete answer.
4. mRNA vaccines given age group? facebook likes important stuff? 

\[Honestly dompamine hell drug manipulating peoples behaviour\] mRNA vaccines slightly less effective Delta variant 
Here’s important takeaway article:

“Doctors researchers say still strongly recommend Americans 12 older get vaccine, heart problems uncommon cases mild.” tell  complaining officials handling new disease revising recommendations according new findings new data. 

You perspective scale work done here. overload constant bombardment studies anecdotal reports hitting medical professionals right currently GLOBAL research happening large fast pace.

This never going perfect. Also, average person street dumb sack rocks. You’re absolutely right variant probably pretty soon emerge that’s resistant vaccine. many people vaccinated going again, it’s matter time. technology tested, we’ll able get new vaccine quickly – years, it’ll probably like getting regular flu shot. that’s reality we’ll need face matter what, might well return normal now. time Olympics yikes. Oh, no, dip hit new highs 2024 never like flu, lol. debunked year ago, homie. cool i'm sure go get vaccinated behind parents' back...what change mind later i'd end getting vaccinated twice lmao like normal flu variants battled year. imagine would different, even similar, disease get new name. 

Same virus. SARS-COV-2 sufficiently different (in genetic structure evolution—I’m scientist don’t know really) SARS-COV-1 classified separate virus, though still type coronavirus.

As is, variant isn’t different enough thing; it’s variant virus causing disease. That’s understanding could wrong. won’t cry 1 tear anti-vaxer gets covid *Eradication?*

Not endgame, even know it. super funny see frame socialization negative way, tells everything need know.

We're moving without bud, good luck. officers already had, recovered from, CoVid? natural immunity, need get vaccinated?

Not trying make point, asking really don’t know answer. color palette first graph beyond dreadful. Three blue shades, two nearly indistinguishable... really? Brown people dont count.

Let's honest here. Vector vaccines (comparatively) underwhelming. 

\- J&amp;J lots problems production millions doses lost due contamination

\- AZ even problems meeting contracts, god-only-knows reasons (I also suspect quality control). also probably dangerous (comparatively speaking) vaccines there, point several countries restricted use others abandoning altogether.

\- Despite promising left right, hard russians meet promised countries (Serbia, Hungary Argentina) got enough doses Sputnik make difference. also hear contamination issues, specially second dose. 

Plainly mRNA inactivated virus vaccines produced enough numbers. former effective safe also comparatively reactogenic, later effective extremely safe next none side effects. 49 cases

Novavax developing hybrid COVID/Flu booster shot, would awesome see future!  think eventually close eradicated, but....it take long time.......(thus ""impossible"") point. 

The vaccines NEVER promised COULDNT get COVID vaccinated, even delta variant. stats less likely die. Israel \~59% population fully vaccinated. Obviously cannot speak hospitals Florida, hospital staff.

As employees majority Medical Dental staff obtained vaccinations hospital directly, hospital knows vaccinated. 

Now new hires different story, hospital Administration said ask, new hire obligation answer, though do. Delta variant coronavirus almost doubled week 73 people confirmed died testing positive variant, 26 vaccine guess lesson get overconfident. Herd immunity still fair distance away, vaccine sure guarantee Delta variant. Yeah, honestly I’m at. I’m young nurse, everything telling even variants aren’t taking point post vaccine… hear otherwise, I’m hanging friends, getting nails done, going baseball games. Normal shit. 

I still wear mask work supermarket, that’s preference. respect mask preferences other. feel safe enough least certain activities. someone US, incredible many people understand bad here. Even people vaccinated, socially distanced, stayed place, etc.

It feels like truly getting people understand failure ""too political"" something. truth feels hyperbolic. even sympathetic descriptions can't stoke than, ""yeah, Trump terrible"" type reactions. Perhaps slow rolling nature disaster something psychological way. friend hold polio shot reason hesitant. “That 70 years proof works.” happily explained first started shots, zero human trials. placebo controlled trial initial dissemination vaccine. 1.6 million kids enrolled.

But, potential get slippery slope done mindfully. know friend mine trying get job teaching English south Korea, careful make sure medical records show taking/had taken stimulants ADHD, since take kindly hiring folks take medication mental health. That’s less associates degree. personally guarantee people keep perpetuation idea vaccinated people need mask hunker till “covid goes away,” remaining unvaccinated population fact get vaccine. Ever. Since context answering idea SARS-CoV-2 “not threat children” addressing related concept infections = opportunities mutation = chances strain escapes vaccinated protections, most-relevant take-away children young adults *are* getting sick significant rates. (Many people mistakenly believe children literally can’t catch COVID-19—in reality do, though rates lower adults many children hospitalized, need ICU care, and/or die, looks like rates *long-term health problems* following infection nearly high children adults.)

Here’s up-to-date article [UK vaccination one 18 vaccinated, 50, they’ve using modified schedule 2nd shots people going 2-3 months 1 shot. particularly relevant since Delta variants make 96% UK cases, protection single shot (depending vaccine) around 50% efficacy Delta.

This... That’s hate whole COVID craze. People say one thing safe isn’t don’t even fuckin clue happen line. People lost sense objectivity want good reason masks stores? long spend cold average year? long spent cold last 2 years? Personally I’ve 0 colds since masks started . Usually 2 months worth cold though year (including mild symptoms). me, masks stores (grocery etc restaurants) seems reasonable. They’re air conditioned, you’re long people spend lot less time sick. Good trade imo you’re able get vaccine choose whatever stupid reason get covid…that’s you. little sympathy that. could probably write masters thesis length paper topic. long strange series events hard pinpoint, differs many people, varies depending live. 

Theres rural america, urban america. people rural america, watched afar virus hardly affected them. friend lives rural Oregon, hardly affected way. never took seriously. 

Then people urban centers vastly different experiences depending big city was, state in, state's response restrictions. 

Here midwest, *very* cases followed lead states locked down. know it, virus unknown thought could stop tracks. Instead made everyone fed situation beginning. lockdown ended, many people thought worst already over. turned case, waited vaccine. 

The media done harm good. politics issue well. Republicans claimed Trump responsible vaccine, came time take one Republicans knew skeptical anyone taking it. 

 live covid restrictions ended last month. People arent social distancing, wont use mask since required, moved lives. got vaccinated, spent year following situation closely. Im exhausted want move on. realize over, theres much anymore. part. Sounds great theory, except spread, mutation, kids, hospitalizations, etc. there’s mountain reasons unvaccinated going cause expensive long term issues.  Vaccines...plus Pfizer vaccine 88% effective delta strain. little disingenuous. height pandemic right Christmas/New Years. fatalities decreasing since mid January.

I'd sure hate last American die COVID freely available vaccine months though. disagree, even risk greater elsewhere mean carry risk children unvaccinated, no? know risk is, leave medical professionals. Performative selflessness degree makes little sense. little bit selfishness completely normal detrimental society, it’s define world. food shortage North Korea doesn’t mean refrain burger tonight solidarity. ...do understand Australia New Zealand need open eventually?

Look comments here, it’s quite clear ppl think vaccinations. 

We need IQ tests corona tests wife told 10 minutes ago holdout coworker getting vaccinated! idea changed him. 

This feels like kind shift. Maybe Delta getting attention? 

That story coworkers room going hospital two died one vaccinated person wasn’t even infected powerful story. 

Whatever reason, I’ll take it! randomized community test populations give meaningful positivity rates. Otherwise matter people likely request require tests today vs last week.

Sewage testing seems pretty random. Wonder that's trending? Fatigue; State &amp; Federal governments coordinated response lock whole country stop spread.

I spend much time reading anti-mask, Anti-vax anti-lockdown threads actually believe Covid less deadly refuse math. ""This year"" arbitrary cut off. includes peak deaths January ignores vaccine rollout, really got going March-May.  said .1% May hospitalizations people vaccine

.8% May deaths gotten vaccine Unfortunately there's much boasting spite we're reduced to... Nobody explain nonsense point. can't see rules lasting much longer, especially ones getting screwed everything (i.e. got vaccinated). hope constantly needing additional vaccination, science behind current double vaccines states needed. covers delta.

It starts feel like vaccinated really vaccinated vaccines effective coming variants.

I think need reassurance this, since what's right getting vaccines dad insane, mom isn’t anti vaccination, thinks current vaccine might safe. disagree isn’t malicious Uh pretty much everywhere already has, state in? interesting watch play too. Canadian, *incredibly* cautious reopening (it's driving nutso honest), outdoor masks never thing took off. see odd person wearing one seems convenience (going multiple stores short time point taking off) anything else.

And yet I've seen lot discourse outdoor masks online seems even something ""pro-lockdown"" crowd US latched onto. It’s better slightly outdated wrong factor 25 think “anti-vaxxers” get bad rap should. think reality situation much simple. people like told something required. human nature finest worst depending situation. continue educate, encourage, incentivize, etc people options damnit can’t get board demonizing outright discriminating someone isn’t vaccinated. alarming news american pension providers, like shit seems delta variant information coming Israel used mostly 2 shot solution (Pfizer) vaccine evasion. terms seems number break infections quite high variant. ask question immunocompromised people? data much less effective vaccines them? asking little sister (13) takes Humira Crohn’s received second Pfizer dose week ago. places, cases low kid statistically safer they've even everyone wearing masks. Maybe take Disneyland, zoos, parks, playdates kids vaccinated families safe. Thanks, Canadians hope too, hands certain point. fully within rights countries determine eligibility full vaccination, one naive arrogant enough think Canadian ""standards"" must apply everywhere else world. best minimize chances screwing engage vaccine mixing validity outside Canada.

The irritating thing Canadian politicians public health doctors practically shaming anyone refuses mix mRNA vaccines insisting Pfizer Moderna interchangeable difference like Pepsi versus Coke - juvenile analogy.

Canadian doctors politicians effectively ""shooting now, asking questions later"" exhorting many Canadians possible ""fully"" vaccinated next couple weeks obvious growth Indian variant (which caused government bungling earlier year closing borders far late). They're thinking happens later summer deal Canadians whose vaccination histories real hodgepodge settle matters international travel (if government foresight/courage). chilling read honest, always potential long hauler symptoms worried me.

Complete garbage makes mad haha

Has anyone read garbage? guy Dr. Malone barely inventor mRNA, one many back day mins Google research, pulled unknown reason going deeper it. seems weird agenda mRNA vaccines think pushing drug called Ivermectin? That's true though. get another disease requires hospital capacity full unvaccinated covid patients might die. Delta coming town get you’re saying. worldometer isn’t date. majority states aren’t reporting new numbers. know many flaws guys comment decide hill die brevity’s sake lol believe really boosters hence mix match. believe reason seeing quoted doctor asked back (not virologist etc) body develop anitbodies adenovirus shell delivery mechanism.  Sure that's goal post lifting restrictions removing mask mandates. 


Another surge could put hospitals overflow hurt Covid patients patients needs. shit right there. Instead HCQ+ least they've moved ivermectin flavor bs.  personally liked Crystal Covid better Less deadly flu

Actually it’s not. can't anything situation India Brazil. want hunker solidarity something? Fuck that, I'm vaccinated, close friends family vaccinated, cases state extremely low, I'm going go parties without mask on, thank much. Ups n downs ... tend isolate nature various reasons effectively forcing get outside meet people I'm familiar surely helps. someone explain proof vaccine remove 14 day quarantine period international travel England Germany? understand England hotspot delta you’re fully vaccinated would need wait 14 days especially provide negative test yet vaccinated part problem Success keeping cases low reduced urgency vaccination. Meanwhile, unexpectedly, Delta happened. makes populations largely untouched covid even vulnerable before, leaks dangerous tough control. timing Delta variant really worse Australia New Zealand. would strongly suggest using Bing, Florida clearly didn’t report 45k new cases yesterday. did, would articles it.

Saving minutes isn’t worth extra risk I’d much rather get accident non-highway speed. yeah, us factor kids driving choices. virus ravaging anti-vaxers anti-maskers people live real world continue life normal.

A pity, that. /s AH toddler? can’t equate teenagers 2 year olds, can’t equate teenagers elderly. mean 90% effective twice ineffective 95% effective Deaths first year life also different.

Apparently much different. put infant mortality 0.6% deaths. Google says 5.7 1000, checks. 5.7 deaths 90% deaths occur baby hits 1.

Just 5.7 still order magnitude greater deaths 1 2.

But 0.6% greatly undersells effect life expectancy. deaths could otherwise live 70 80 years. Someone dying 50s 60s would 15 20 years remaining. one infant deaths weighted much heavier. Numbers UK showing fully vaccinated people still small chance spreading covid. significantly reduced, still there. 

I'm arguing CDC's decision wrong (or right), I'm putting info think important folk facts make fully informed decisions things. wish could get better data news Africa. Yeah know, I’m holding hope. long vaccinated, risk spread others, need refrain going out. get numbers from? far I’ve seen hospitalisation numbers took vaccines. I'm 177% covered. checked, mine 18% makes sense  Bingo also medicines usually needed chronic conditions probably higher rate mortality potential side effects. slides spell perfectly mRNA vaccines male youth data right spell good picture. Parents need informed that. Sunk cost fallacy mainly. spent much already completely wasted cancel, even insurance payouts. someone unfortunately infected March 2020 would comfortable meeting large groups friends wearing mask around strangers last year I'd recovered? risk serious illness reinfection greatly decreased much like fully vaccinated. Technically, could acted like pandemic universe social repercussions would greatly different now. understand, still vector virus. still infect immunocompromised people, children, unvaccinated. although illness less severe vaccinated recovered alike still infect them. I'm still keeping distance people public limiting social contacts, since start pandemic. too. everyone immediately go back normal virus spread rapidly, increasing risk infection vulnerable groups importantly (because affects too) allows virus massive platform spread mutate point vaccination become less even ineffective preventing illness. mean previously infected people actually form protection virus, even vastly inferior vaccine protection? Well 7 years old guess total non zero number scientific medical concensus vaccines safe.

mRNA technology used decades. conceivable mechanism long term negative effect. evidence contrary, there's first class ticket Stockholm waiting you.

We're dealing exotic strange treatments. We're using experimental treatments. science behind vaccines goes back decades. say ""we can't know"" just... weird? like saying ""Prove Toyota Prius make catch cold year now!"" There's just... mechanism happen.

There plenty things concerned about, vaccines one them. know said got vaccine etc. etc. still giving ""We can't know..."" shtick. know. know. billions dollars tens thousands people making sure know. random untested stuff. knowledge entire weight human expertise behind it. Love username. I’m vaccinated, still religious wearing mask people like you. hurt keep family safe. wish would lifted mandate fast. 100% agreed testing Mrna vaccines , left immunocompromised people it. Due that, one confirm safety or
 effectiveness vaccines immunocompromised. think that’s common misconception actually. mom bloggers stuff use essential oil everything don’t vaccinate kids, feel like image become face anti vaccine movement (and good reason) unfortunately that’s portion anti vaxxers. 

it also comes lot like libertarian conspiracy minded places online predominantly male. think get less media attention. That's surprising, unfortunate. Older people make many antibodies vaccinated. still generally helps. case reports saw people pretty compromised already closest thing would really minor rare, permanent side effect that’s hard see statistically. would still present acutely Solution: Cancel wait 2024. know sucks lot people, like past 15 months joyride anyone else. stupid country sound like someone never met 7 year old. get links source that? Smug remarks funny way. look upvoted are. Thank posting information. 

We beginning see rise infections Florida counties vaccination rates low. media coverage mention number cases found usual survey, minor outbreaks.

Hospitalization rates rising Osceola Jackson Counties. news coverage outbreaks now. don’t know link without deleted there’s interview Slate Dr Monica Gandhi regarding take variants everyone read. Gottlieb measured, rational voices give accurate truthful breakdowns. oncologist told get flu vaccine chemo.  missed Wired one. link? Whelp, that’s one way increase percentage people vaccinated :( World hunger me, enough food fridge.

A bit tone deaf, no? Alma Mater, UF, require vaccination. It’s Florida university, don’t think legally require covid vaccine thanks DeSantis; however, UF estimates somewhere 70% 80% students vaccinated. 

UF also moving fully normal campus experience fall. Less 50% county UF vaccinated. expect hold outs add covid college experience. Oh well.. 🤷‍♀️ scratching surface long term issues. 


I elementary school students elevated heart rates lung scarring... doctors know mean development. one US ever going comply restrictions again. It’s over. us vaccinated (and idiots aren’t) happily living normal life again. know personally won’t wear mask listen new restrictions try shit again. I’m done, rest country. preventing cases, hospitalizations deaths rise US. UK manage it. clearly measures taken.

Look figures since June 1st UK. Almost every data point COVID-19 growing rapidly UK due Delta variant. variant also rapidly spreading US.

* [Reproduction [Share positive [Hospital [Hospital [ICU FDA putting warning kids get vaccinated heart inflammation, I'll keep kids safe keeping home MRNA them. Right, hopefully end case come fruition may directly feeding it. older persuasion get it, locked away last year half want experience life little time left world. know plenty young people also made social sacrifices old immunocompromised continue so. hope bite ass variants come along, especially someone who's immunocompromised.    bad rollout significantly slower European countries.

Dr. Malone's research lead actually invent mRNA vaccine?  True that’s scared humans operate. Well yeah that’s discussed always takes time governments adapt rules new scientific findings (such as: vaccinated people less likely Covid symptoms, also less likely transmit virus).
And guess reducing quarantine requirements risk area would apply UK, also countries like Russia, bribing government official get fake vaccine certificate pretty easy.
I personally agree allowing vaccinated people test quarantine make sense. So, know vaccinated people getting spreading Delta variant?  reddit discussion someone last night. wife fully vaccinated since January. still wear masks everywhere go, even though state dropped mask mandates. So, asked 'why?'

Because 4.5year old son home. He's vaccinated. might catch something bother me, I'd bringing home could get sick. while, statistically, he's likely get sick it, could bring straight camp/school give friend, bring home get family member sick.

And wearing mask, getting curbside delivery fucking easy. literally zero effort much stuff.   Yeah math using efficacy formula vaccinated unvaccinated deaths come really high degree efficacy. Mixing tested AZ/Pfizer IIRC Moderna/Pfizer, safe effective. heard testing J&amp;J uses similar mechanism AZ (so fine followed mRNA vaccine) Man love Iceland. pragmatic.   doctor delay vaccine white blood cell count goes up.

&amp;#x200B;

until?

do know happens white cell count goes transplant recipients?

my neighbor lupus.. also takes immunosuppressants.

she's MD.. got 2 series vax that's doctor white blood cell count goes up.

meanwhile.. body **EXCEPTIONALLY** vulnerable actual infection?

The tragic thing is, long term side effects covid exist. People still feel symptoms year recovering. long term side effects observed vaccine.

You let fake science social media dictate decisions life. could seriously ill. still could suffer long term side effects.

It job educate closest make mistake did. 30% COVID survivors suffer permanent damage bodies result virus. anti-vaxxers usually younger 85, they're spring chickens. They're likely middle aged, young enough know surf net, old enough good distinguishing good info net unreliable info. people going die virus directly, going suffer long term health effects probably shorten lives.  Honestly would probably make difference, probably get downvoted hell this. However waiting untill full approval get ours. antivaxer all, cautious one new experimental (probably right word) vaccine. 

Another worry mine kids arent old enough get vax anyway worry mutations aggressive children thats viruses host adults vaxed...

I constantly reading articles (from medical sources, trying stear clear popular news ones) learn help sway concerns. 

That said, arent vaxed, literally dont anything around people still treating like quarantine. husband works home, homeschool (even pre pandemic) mom retired online school (she lives us) us getting vax right seems like negligible decision really wont endanger anyone else.

People somehow seem forget 48 million Americans age 12. poisons people's minds well bodies.  pandemic, people thought real, Masks Tyranny, big deal, trust case numbers, Deaths Mattered, vaccines cause magnetism, etc. etc. etc. would agree. work Texas ER Physician received vaccine last December. worked 4 different facilities never asked Covid vaccine card I've near heard licky ghosts. bunch dummies needle phobia like looking get jabbed. Got second shot today nurse told good go 'wait done?' Literally feel it. first one little small prick, like pinch getting hair pulled out.

Now aftermath painless know sure? You’re fine masks kids get vaccinated? guess missed something here. Sure, everyone make decisions, facts, especially they’re young impressionable.

Also, don’t think know “long term effects” means context vaccine. It’s already year since first trials. closing 2 billion vaccinations globally. long term side effects. you’re talking adverse effects magically pop years injection, simply possible mRNA way works. That’s educating (and closest you) subject key.

You’re villain, fool. ""post-vaccine"" world yet case numbers incredibly high Israel breakthrough infections without testing know transmission among vaccinated population. Literally every time take child house, gambling life extent. car could suddenly swerve crash sidewalk. Maybe there's public shooting literally public place kid gets killed. let swim? Why? Drowning *massive* risk children. mean, honestly see insane set line vaccinations ""I gamble kid's life"" exact thing every single day? long athletes protected fans allowed, Olympics fine.

So fine, greed get way. hear, man? Covid OVER! WON! /s Fully vaccinated people still die COVID, rare insignificant opposed cost continued societal closure.

But also consider vaccine used, MRNA vaccines higher efficacy (including emerging variants) vs Astra Zeneca distributed UK (but US).

The best data longterm protection Pfizer vaccine think comes Israel, vaccine personally received. Evidence? can't smell taste dead. Somebody self-educating Facebook /s along lines assumptions. people left vaccinated family (besides one anti-vax aunt, nurse, course) male cousins early twenties. it’s vaccines, can’t bothered it. important, lot people got tested work school required / suggested it.

I know people worked schools got multiple tests week offered one. symptoms necessary. College students getting tested frequently. Israel's coronavirus czar Dr. Nahman Ash said Thursday Israel reinstate indoor mask mandate beginning Sunday, light recent rise coronavirus cases across Israel.

Ash said government working bringing Pfizer vaccines Israel. Israel unsuccessful attaining new vaccines, run July, Israel's store vaccines set expire.

Ash added Israel investigating new ""technological tools"" enforce coronavirus quarantines, citing Israel's previous attempts employ electronic tracking bracelets. ""We bring forward new proposals technological arena. Shin Bet tracking deal enforcing quarantine, so, time being, plan implementing it,"" Ash said.

Despite dangers new COVID variants, government plan prohibit Israelis leaving entering country, Ash said. ""We trying avoid (scenario) testing isolating"" people, said.

Israel's Health Ministry registered 148 new coronavirus cases Wednesday, highest daily increase since May, infectious delta variant makes headway across country.

Also Thursday, senior official Pfizer Israel said company's vaccine 90 percent effective preventing symptomatic coronavirus cases, 95 percent effective preventing serious cases require hospitalization. However, effectivity vaccine preventing infection transmission still unclear.

The northern city Binyamina declared ""red"" Israel's so-called traffic light system, reflecting relatively high rate coronavirus infection, amid new uptick cases.

Prof. Ran Balicer, chief professional coronavirus cabinet advises Israel's coronavirus cabinet, told Kan public radio believes localities face restrictions coming days, played prospects lockdown.

Earlier, Prof. Chezy Levy, director general Health Ministry, told radio station ministry soon know breakdown numbers – many diagnosed returned abroad, instance, many unvaccinated children. But, added ""the wave infections continuing regardless.""

When asked many new coronavirus patients vaccinated, Levy said ""We're looking rate 40 50 percent,"" said figure concerning.

""Even though numbers low, fact reaching vaccinated people means…that still checking many vaccinated people also infected,"" Levy added.

Sidenote vaccine able age group work status time got covid state fault linked December 2020 publication simply talked vaccine hesitancy among women. article discussed post also explained women previously reported vaccine hesitancy men U.S. well. report May 2021 shows vaccinations females U.K. actually far higher males, think argument falls short: figure 5.  April 2021 Office National Statistics believes 75.5% females received least one dose vs. 70.1% males. I’m vaccinated everyone point isn’t vaccinated consciously choosing get it, that’s fault. states open, gonna fun kids 12?

People give weird look still wear mask. kids vaccinated want transmit something them.  Dude we’ve eradicated 2 diseases history humanity- small pox polio. still even pop occasionally it’s small enough considered eradicated sucks

Does it? big question vaccine prevents Long Covid developing get breakthrough infection. 


I've already risk getting Covid expendable frontline employee, vaccine seems like Covid going away due nature job likely point get matter hoping everyone else job cares. 


And upon seeing reaction people celebrated hard wear masks work, stopped supplying us regularly. figure going end well. It’s 70%+ US population fully vaccinated. Saying problem new Variantes forming half US population isn’t even fully vaccinated. prefer TBC, Burning Covid It’s like we’re dealing resistant variant virus currently. Delta variant, smelta variant, wanna see Foo Fighters Dave Chapelle able cough someone’s face unapologetically like used to. Research says otherwise alright. One anecdotal confirmation here, received mRNA side effects despite auto immune disease! South stupid bad Positive test percentage lowest ever. Testing non-issue stop caring case numbers post-vaccine world. That’s keep asking people - explain mechanism action would case long term side effects. It’s usually crickets Yes. also speaks loudly character family member would put want child’s needs.
I don’t think I’d want child around person like that, relative not. Indeed. Considerably less half bodily mass genetically (source: Radio 4 Times, Parasite episode) count people already covid, likely times higher tested positive, addition vaccinated likely already reached herd immunity. Everyone high risk almost half year st point get shot. Anyone wants one get one. point need move fuck on. shutdowns masks first emerged vaccine. different situation can’t keep living lives fear. you’re vaccinated get covid that’s you. Oh ok.  card says received two valid doses brand second dose got. many European countries mixing least AZ Pfizer / Moderna. US won’t discerning. Shouldn’t issue.   semantic argument calling people selfish? Again, kids going school necessary growth development. 

Not getting vaccine risking Covid necessary.

No one saying kids back school. 

But 12+ fully vaccinated do. test trace oriented. easier small population. ever go you’ll understand effective.

Masks good tool fight, nothing , nothing less. got end entity US delta variant worrying enough need wear mask I’m fine right now? I’m fully vaccinated Moderna right States tiger.  Could try actually read research? we’re following science trust that, now, information leads us believe vaccines protect hospitalization even Delta variant. Cases aren’t best metric majority people vaccinated breakthrough infections large won’t result hospitalization death. see CDC others reconsider NPIs recommend put back place la Israel next week? One profiles Kariko, describe sort issue test animals early development technique, details little scant it. Regarding Malone, wonder carrying emotional baggage anything find, real intuition matter. Though again, pure speculation, would make nice tidy story. article highly disingenuous feels like written Reddit Covid doomposter. Case counts definitely higher - January February. real world, right now, daily cases US fallen mere trickle comparison, thanks vaccination. 

I swear, 'fuck science' left 2021 getting almost bad 'fuck science' right 2020. - - wrong, choosing trust guts opinions scientists medical community. know quite people aren’t going back office September they’re choosing continue quarantining get vaccine there’s longer term data it. 

I got mine, understand caution around novel vaccine Tokyo increasing rest nation decreasing. appears happening. add user flair settings! bad flu season years ago 150 deaths per day average. hyper aware flu, possible deaths higher due flu (where flu triggered final cause, final cause given cause death. medical community aware covid, covid prioritized cause death).

So stuff said correct, looking equivalent slightly worse flu season vaccines. noticeable anymore.  others stated well, preventable, people care choose vaccinate die. 

I extended family electing vaccinate. tried explain should. would sad got covid resulted death massive health problems. would also view choice, like driving without seatbelt. Wow 26 deaths even 14 days second dose. Idl shit injecting. mean vaccines ineffective future?  People 18 less 1 20,000 chance dying covid.

If kids, I’d probably worry much. That’s lower risk dying car accident year. Thanks read it, great recap. China blood millions hands. Covid far riskier actually is

I've reading one latest variants much worse children previous ones. whole lax saying ""if vaccinated yet that's problem"" viewpoint really shortsighted. Somebody accidentally headline. Silly Belgians, American vaccine doubters change minds!  make day bit brighter....

There one particularly bad day April creates small spike graph, overall much fewer deaths April 2021 November 2020. ""if vaccinated, need wear mask."" People vaccinated, ""good want wear mask anyway nobody ask been, lie them."" Basically.
Also, lot tribe can't vaccinated due limitations travel lack news. I've telling people years still struggle getting water electricity LIVING US! Yet they're still people still surprised it. Yeah, vast majority deaths occurred early 2021 disastrous holiday season had. Cases deaths way way peak lower year.

I’m saying people act like it’s 2019 tomorrow, I’m personally still wearing masks think CDC’s new guidance premature, feel like chewing people post vaccine behavior less stringent unreasonable point.

There's historical distrust authority here, partly old communist regime, partly recent government that's full-on corrupt earned ire population. result, anything government says seen skeptical lens.

I think that's crux it. That, plus Russia pretty active disinformation here, pushing anti-European rhetoric internet. result, anything that's coming Europe, including vaccine supplies, seen skepticism.

Finally, worth point that, due warm weather, Covid caseload pretty low right now. also mild first wave government reacted quickly, Covid problems feel distant average Bulgarian.

All amounts uphill battle government convince population get jab. hope attitudes change.  Yup, half get vaxxed going heat hit hard late fall. choosing continue caution around novel vaccine

I think true though. getting vaccinated quarantining, things would fabulous everyone involved. Easy vaccinations competent President eases lot worry.  journalist/reporter?.. would think one agencies investigating origination virus would work lead.

The reason matters anti vaccine people also say they're supported science. They're wrong. Saying supported reputable institution helps give actual credibility. 300M AstraZeneca could used someone wants Africa Latin America.  not, anxietyx suchx, anyx not, anxietyx matter would brain cells suddenly spike proteins? I'd say many people never cared begin with. bit sociopathic ask me. Sounds like Canada fully unlocked July. province releasing lockdowns restrictions July 5 either going immunize population faster, start divert excess (on hand future deliveries) sooner, slower, divert excess doses slower, gets distributed end.

Sure, someone living US, complaining gotten shot earlier, African perspective, US sitting hundreds millions vaccines using plan use, sitting *just case*. 

This definition trickle-down. got ours, make sure needs taken care of, happy give want. 

On point paid it, nothing wrong that, want talk equity, sitting 300 million doses saying eventually give guys chill probably bad form. Public policy evidence based. Full stop. Every second article Pfizer good protections delta variant. Israel vaccinated population Pfizer. what’s issue? infants die seasonal flu, far greater threat age range. disinformation spreading social media last week inferiority Western vaccines superiority Sinovac.

Natural immunity protective durable. rate Delta spread, means we’ll get herd immunity faster.

Hospitalization rates [are cases like used to, either. Except canary choose coalmine, unlike unvaccinated people. they've gone counting guessing death toll.

Great. caveat that. Apparently lot people double vaccines still infected carriers certain strain showing symptoms. untestable obviously can’t reported. doesn’t mean aren’t people carriers. thought interesting bit info. Either way, anecdote. framed like it’s complicated issue? many US ease cases deaths way, way down. don’t think anyone thinks it’s over. Let rephrase that— don’t think intelligent people think it’s over. feel empathy places hit hard. It’s finally take breath knowing we’re much safer here. Still need get lot vaccinations arms we’ve done well Pfizer moderna effective I’ll say don’t care  think need hysterical, cases US plateauing start rising - likely within week. Multiple low-vaccination states starting see mild rises cases. states high vaccination running ""room"" fall. Massachusetts can't make 400 case rise Missouri 60 cases day drop. words, really anywhere go up. 

The spread virus become regional (what places high vaccination rates versus low vaccination rates?) pockets uncontrolled spread vaccination rates low. asterisk due UK done aggressive age stratification vaccines, seeing rapid rise cases despite much higher vaccination rate (partial full) US. Israel - long viewed virus control - seeing rapid exponential spread (absolute numbers low, Rt far one). 

Again, meant ""hysterical"" - statement inevitable facts. case decline over; (at least short run) - nature pandemic changed. longer national affair, regional one.  many areas united states might well over, deaths higher worldwide sure, mainly happened india.

Were halfway year first 3 months 2020 virtually deaths. took deaths ramp 2020, shit gonna higher year regardless I've read article too, quite strange. Either testing criteria (even hard explain), vaccine efficacy close 0%. know going on. 2020: 📈 
2021: 📉 agree, also find curious people shoes (you unvaccinated family) aren’t willing suggest solutions. take COVID tests! double mask, outside, hold child short minutes! gold standard vaccination sure, options they’re wanted. &lt;3 vaccinated internet stranger Ill tell why. stayed indoors mostly, gone varying levels depression, panic attacks, gone edge killing myself, worried people know home country would die worlds worst outbreak. Dealt finally vaccination changed everything. basically shot normal life 14-15 months sacrifice. Im 5 weeks past second dose already anxiety way down, Im sleeping better , mental physical state touching pre pandemic levels. However even feel anxious places like gym sometimes wear mask feel safe.

After want give shit people take vaccine willfully dont Im sorry dont mental capacity empathy. would try strangle doctor still enough strength left. Emotional labor. I’m seeing especially stark relief right work home husband teacher summer. days feel like I’m working two jobs he’s watching TV. wish true unfortunately everyone get vaccine. got first shot today one 40 vaccinated country. Probably legal issues Yeah, that's true, tested vaccine supervised phase 1 volunteers time animal testing. still passed pre-clinical/'animal trial' phase. God-damned think Ireland, Spain, Denmark Norway get vaccinated population. According ECDC tracker, Ireland seems winning hoping continues! Vaccinations media showing much big deal anymore. Also think lots people got used it. Wearing masks, social distancing, stuff think people got used apart daily lives. know have. yeah, I'm vaccinated still wear mask. I'm careful careful be. Asking everyone wear masks indoors science based policy, rooted human behavior. lieu constantly verifying vaccination status. However feel effectiveness vaccines, far easier reduce risk way trust people. lot American holdouts get vaccinated next four six months.

Currently, coronavirus vaccine currently ""fully approved"" FDA. Three given emergency use authorization agency. full approval given summer/fall......either health premiums unvaccinated skyrocket, they'll facing denials coverage. 12/10 Outstanding maneuver people fully vaccinated one shot?

The studies UK talking 88 % protection symptomatic covid fully vaccinated people. don’t say can’t get Covid. nice unsarcastically. 

We’re talking redoing indoor masking. Chill out. future US. also means upcoming case “surges” likely short, small peaks plateaus rather prolonged, meteoric rises like threatened health care system capacity. Yeah no, grew Orange County ignorance world wide Well first off, AP, generally considered one three legitimate news organizations world. pulling crap butts.

Last week, linked estimates June July made German government (probably Moderna announcement): countries get amount vaccine share relative population (unless opted expensive batches), could take German estimates, divide 7, multiply 4, get rough estimates Spain.

America given IQ test en mass Vs countries think would do?

Vaccinated people incredibly low risk spreading virus. Calling vaccinated people self centered they’re longer staying home little ridiculous, risk even getting infected incredibly unlikely. Unpopular Opinion: Skepticism early adoption medicine isn’t crazy. (I say someone views global vaccination pathway mess.) 


tl;dr: COVID-19 vaccines great! wasn’t assured beginning even basis trial data alone. 

RNA therapeutics appear safe, effective powerful, history littered drugs/interventions made way clinical trials discovered little benefit (Zetia) actually dangerous disclosed (Vioxx). 

Further, vaccine trials weren’t designed identify sigma harms (1 ~15k) matters population order billion receive intervention. 

Additionally, prior infection autoimmune disease exclusion criteria Pfizer Moderna’s trials. folks positive COVID-19 IgG slipped trials (on order 100s patients). disease antibody enhanced disease reasonable theoretical concern likely true rate prior infection likely much higher observed rate, generalizability trial means assured. 

As dust settled widespread vaccination, vaccines appear quite safe (though associated unpleasant systemic adverse effects sizable minority patients) _might_ even therapeutic COVID long haulers. means assured based trial data alone. Health authorities still split whether kids even get it. doesn’t recommend it. Pretty sure data suggests it’s threat children. wonder reflected life insurance rates?

When got life insurance years ago, answer lot health questions sent someone home get blood samples such. 

It seems pretty likely people unvaccinated would pay higher life insurance rates going forward. data mild Covid (i.e. requiring hospitalisation) causes long term symptoms. no, may tolerable outcome. Outcomes judged public health whole, narrow focus whether hospitals overwhelmed.

I'm afraid 'try enjoy lives' wait we've dealt Covid. infection rate higher ever county. 60% vaccinated stores still requiring masks despite state county mandate ending. know it’s little topic bad working environment US? hate working culture Japan passion always wondered it’s worse US. although still carry mask car case store I'm going still requires mask wearing. gotta say none recently mask might disappear life altogether soon. naw bro. got wrong. 45% Americans fully vaccinated. majority not. sure focus adults... even focus adults percentage vaccinated 53%... straight uncle cdc.

look. vaccine great original version virus less effective newer variants. think least effective delta variant... think numbers still side vaccinated means still like become severely ill, learned anything last year global problem.

the virus continues run rampant likely variant emerge dangerous even vaccinated people. 

while wish vaccinated individual reality not. vaccinated don’t kids 12 unvaccinated high risk people house, it’s probably huge risk. Yes, number people think virus literally isn’t real small. There’s larger contingent think threat exaggerated.

Of course, side spectrum sizeable contingent people think Covid far riskier actually (deaths rates 10%, etc.), cuts ways.  get spreads more, correct? less deadly? Wow title scared shit me. Canada, approving mixing among AZ, Pfizer, Moderna. Turns AZ Sinopharm. So, ignoring bad ones except Bulgaria, one except Bulgaria bad?  Sydney. industry moving towards direction requiring COVID vaccination condition employment. couple issues surrounding this:
1) COVID vaccines still emergent use approval FDA, different vaccination requirements health providers requiring condition employment
2) DOL (department labor) guidance surrounding legality requiring emergent use vaccine condition employment…until weeks ago. 

There legal cases already surrounding issue courts already sided healthcare facilities businesses early adopters requiring COVID vaccine condition employment around country. moving correct direction. 

We see least Pfizer full FDA approval next month two. enough actual world data support approval submitted full application governmental approval. enable businesses require vaccination condition employment. 

Also, OSHA came new rules surrounding COVID precautions week (yeah, it’s year late) require organizations create policy response surrounding COVID mitigation. requirements old science/evidence borne requirements longer needed you’re vaccinated. Organizations need policify response new rules either accept science based evidence support whether follow rules (ie don’t need socially distance vaccinated). big step putting vaccination requirements organizations without legal repercussions employees. 

Ultimately, FDA gives full, unconditional approval vaccine(s) enough legal protection employers require vaccines condition employment. (IMO). happens, don’t think see widespread requirements around vaccination status. (FYI, hospital organization working plan require staff submit proof vaccination rolled next couple weeks internal employee health department, anticipating change moving towards it). J&amp;J: One done, wham bam thank ma'am. long alpha variant we're OK!!! /S

But seriously thought Pfizer came said variant problem vaccine, heard immunity. kids too. We’ve got vaccines it’s months get one kid. unvaccinated people refusers immune compromised folks. There’s still large population waiting. problem basically over, kids getting severely ill near 0 rate

For now. able travel easily without covid-19 passport sure helps, want go vacation. rare case people's selfishness overriding stupid beliefs, benefiting society's common interest. 1. Virus binds better cellular receptors.

Small side note, vaccine actually intended prevent infection first place, reduce symptoms. new effectiveness around 88% Indian variant. means 12% chance even catch virus exposed.  No, AZ reaches optimum 2-dose efficacy 12 weeks gap. 3 week gap efficacy lot lower. Yeah fucking know. impossible. didn’t lockdown like countries (and I’d argue don’t remain lockdown indefinitely expect visitors show proof complete vaccination) covid stay. eradicating covid us anymore. doesn’t even seem goal. We’re aiming control. 

I think that’s fucking bullshit someone administrative capacity mandate vaccines. ""Most currently hospital COVID-19 Britain unvaccinated, health officials say.

Speaking BBC Breakfast, Head NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, said many hospital Bolton – badly hit Delta variant COVID-19 first discovered India – younger, ""very, few"" fully vaccinated (www.bbc.com/news/uk-57367849 , , www.bbc.com/news/uk-57294438).

A study presented UK government's scientific advisers likewise indicated vaccines drastically decreased chance think intended near future people vaccinated. catching covid similar flu, probably go hospital get mild case. monitor oxygen levels (not temperature we're used flu), case situation worsens. True enough, think I'll wait scientific conclusions established. vaccines prevent getting COVID-19; keep getting sick or, failing that, make sickness less severe. thing would truly prevent getting hermetically sealed chamber.

Vaccines less like force field like starting fight power-ups fully loaded. children get vaccinated, me. Wth...this sounds fishy, looks like money exchanged hands, pikachu face.. consequences two doses though. One-dose efficacy drops like stone Delta variant. doses vaccines (almost) effective Delta (as Alpha original strain) Yes. He’s opportunist. ignore him. He’s predicting market crashes decade. suddenly he’s Covid expert. No. Ignore Thanks. much before? Well can't stay lockdown mode forever we? 18 months already point restrictions hurting actual virus itself, IMO. (im Canada btw reached 75% (12 older) vaccinated people still rising.) per capita number one matters. Science works. Thanks. Mine 6th May. probably impossible Australia New Zealand. also impossible America, Americans get vaccine. (agreed unlikely that, due poor choices population govorners/leadership.) countries better situations US fair chance, already see.  countires much willing lock properly, mask up, America not. Thats biggest incentive, cannot get die hard anti vaxxers get vaccinated, ton vaccination hesitant people safety concerns, see goes well surrounding also get shot. case two people waited despite chance get since march, finally want get shots asap! exactly. aids comparison bothering me.... aids vax still running rampant thru many countries.... say, covid? Flu? COVID wake call millions overweight sedentary people country start focusing healthy eating exercise. long history humans viruses confirm viruses evolve milder forms virus time, less lethal contagious mutations crowd less contagious lethal.

If case, Humans would gone extinct long time ago. Given context comment comes across ""COVID kills old, sick people issue""  gonna say... someone living Bulgaria, statement OP made laugh loud. even vaccine supply, either... Vaccines available many months. I'm foreigner got first dose May.

Main reason vaccine hesitancy. get PCR results?? Like register?  assuming governments/communities spread message individual behavior one vaccine vaccinated

That core issue. agree partially vaccinated better all, fellow German really seen kind messaging. like ""oh already got first dose, I'm mostly protected"" hold Delta especially immunized AstraZeneca. That's think first doses take priority full immunity. Belgium must Fox News. Faux news that's also small percentage population.  Deadlier have/had coming em due personal, Darwinian choices.

 kiddos options bothers me. Yes? medical information keeps modified. wonder they'll say next month. least live whole set laws raise taxes pay medical costs, restrict smoke prevent people passing smoke others. smokers made shiver outside door previous form social distancing. Last week someone r/coronavirus said US ""currently lowest cases per capita world, practically equal Australia"" 😂

At least exceptionalist made us discover many talented comedians... No, I'm saying part calculations. I'm saying calculate things like number, similar theme person saying.  rising significant extent?  went looked Mississippi, relatively low vaccination rates significant increase cases could see.   think natural immunity infection, vaccination, even poorer states, well vanishing, eliminated, even managed measles. Seems like unrealistic target. [CDC Data Yeah, don’t think talk year 2021 entire year terms Covid. talk months, things changed lot months came along average temperature year far 15 degrees last year!!!1. people think cold weather behind us!?!?? They’ve started testing boosters data released yet sigh.....are another person unaware US worst amount cases world ? Americans uninformed million total cases...worst entire world.

Yes, way runny noses headaches according number media reports seems.  It’s going eradicated. That’s impossible situation. wasn’t impossible beginning. covid become endemic global populations.  Yep, way math works really shows crazy 95% effectiveness really is.

Let them. Sooner later variant get them. Either directly indirectly. Would say vaccine administration public slightly rushed? bet mom lucky sence doesnt personally know anyone unexpectedly died covid. Many people thought desiase old sick outliers, attend third funeral single month... know 2-3 people died covid 40s even 30s, mindset changes quickly.

The truth is, nobody knows mom would handle covid nobody knows would handle covid vaccines road... data says vaccine benefits far outweight risks, data still incomplete... guess mom around 50 years young, certainly past age wanting children... think women like get vaccinated, cant hurt anyone else (if negative consequences offsprings ever proven) covid pretty nasty statistics people past half-life.... opinion everyone 50 get vaccinated, well younger people comorbidities... would healthy female 20s early 30s planning get pregnant, healthy kid teens younger, would naturally doubts... mast cell activation syndrome.

Covid boosters like that. immune system able expose covid generate immediate response. felt like crap immune system recognize throwing everything it. get it. look CDC guidelines. listened panel yesterday like 2nd question asked guideline pamphlet given parents included information updated overwhelming like ""yes should"".

I know everyone wants covid gone yesterday put mind eyes parent reading information giving vaccine child. information says risk dying greater heart inflammation covid people going care community transmission.

No one arguing risks associated vaccine lower Covid every age group. particular one seems males cause seems either undiagnosed heart conditions and/or mRNA vaccines. think schools likely last holdout lack vaccine ages 2-11 teachers unions aggressively pushing restrictions.

With public transport, could see mask mandates dropped early Next Year get holiday season Covid resurgence. 

For healthcare facilities nursing homes, masks probably never going away. someone doesn’t want can’t get vaccinated shouldn’t end it? Can’t everyone vaccinated satisfied knowing safe realistically possible never leaving house carry lives? point actively discriminating peoples vaccination status?

This around long enough many variants around long enough know affects children. know *for specifically*, less dangerous flu.

A vaccine eventually them. It'll probably good idea take added peace mind. changing literally *any* behaviour young children vaccinated proof positive understand risk assessment. I'm immunocomp, vaccinated fully socializing. Sorry. obligated concerned. here. immunologists know shit. Moderna, Pfizer, AZ essentially antigen. inactivated one complex though Ugh thing I’ve got Covid Zero Even AZ, risk adverse effects low it’s almost line general population’s normal risk factors.

Not mention even orders magnitude safer getting routine colonoscopy…  Again, know you’re saying. without data know it’s factor 25? Except probably ravage anti vaxxers, considering they're way likely young. 

Over 50% Covid deaths US 85 years old. CDC's guidance give 2nd shot whenever turn long least 4 weeks since first one.  It’s crazy angry factual comparison makes people. literally indistinguishable cold/allergies? Netherlands, govt seems think many young people take shot good summer filled travel festivals. hope works! data J&amp;J yet? 30% Covid deaths UK 100% vaccinated. Might well enjoy life. ""If shot works, care get it?""

It's convenient means avoiding cognitive dissonance recognizing ignorant decision could kill someone. Yep. pretty weird watch self-processed “pro-science” people become skeptics science (and CDC) started supporting loosening restrictions ending mandates. It’s hard give something you’ve spent much time integrating identity using labels good person. still ongoing. see PDF many reported cases VERS hospitalized? huge amount.  


The link national news. crazy. Poor planning regulation Corporate propaganda. Yes, that's true was. need define ""couldn't go anywhere."" Retail open time, schools open, worked normal. people stayed home kept children home though.

That lockdown lockdown ever done.

Did Canada lockdown March 2020?  question. I’m mad children 12 forgotten Yeah. Well said.

Btw, information, many bucks talking here? I’d hope coworker resources seek therapeutic treatment fear sake sake everyone around her. Exposure therapy effective. People afraid spiders able actually touch spiders end it. 

Fear overcome. Exactly, dying Covid Covid two different things. they’re classified counted two different things. Paywall another kind Covid vaccine? Capitalism drives society economy around you. Yet subs like /r/travel, /r/solotravel, etc. flooded posts americans planning trip abroad covid dealt everywhere else. Masks bother all. Honestly, even if/when over, plan still wear sick. definitive proof wearing mask keeps germs yourself, spread dont need to? mean point feel like know sick around people wear mask, kind asshole... I’m telling Director General Health Ministry saying. It’s still early analysis makes feel better. shocked too. wife got married last year plan go Italy Spain honeymoon. We’re supposed go Spring 2022 hope happen. No, analogy—just one-to-one analogy (i.e. analogous attributes others) asymptomatic people. Please look rates hospitalizations delta variant. much much higher variants, deaths high yet.  


The problem going breakthrough infections hospitals etc. deal staff pop positive? Clinical data showed truly asymptomatic transmission massively, massively overexaggerated. folks refuse vaccinations Missouri also support idiots state legislature refuse fund Medicaid expansion. lead rural hospitals closing patients going St. Louis, Columbia, Kansas City.   I’m sad didn’t understand could prevent getting COVID.”

This misinformation, vaccine doesnt prevent getting covid Yep, cases irrelevant vaccines. Israel currently averages whopping zero deaths per day.  see. right offices priced full occupancy. even 5% dip crush value buildings, totally understand particular narrative needs pushed. fail. WFH attractive many talented people - deal it. reason took vaccine? Yeah like buddy owns CBD shop thinks CBD supplements keep safe Covid. Exactly! kid ends lung scarring needs oxygen super early life? don’t want massively affect quality life I’m sick quarantining now.

I remember back March 2020 couldn’t imagine lasting 18 months 2 years longer, are. We’ve done it, I’ve kept safe far. stumble end vaccines age group sight? need anger management. Mind own. RPh parent consent state...

Make friend adult signs guardian. ""Grandparents"" best... one make sense? I'm you, I'm going keep taking vitamin-D keep mask handy public transit future. Three layers protection definitely makes confident.  virus first claim fame asymptomatic transmission people. data shows won’t continue even vaccinated people infected. someone issue wearing mask last 15 months fully vaccinated I’m sitting 2 questions: vaccinated people hospitalized and/or hospitals overwhelmed? 
No no. Okay cool let know one changes. mean time, spare hysteria stop basing things case numbers. Oooh edgelord I'm going guess partial reason news outlets reporting numbers/deaths way previous administration.  
Not many people realize we're close 620K deaths according worldometers badly delta impacting unvaccinated people immunocompromised/have lost resistance. wanted know who's responsible, need look mirror CNBC. I'm worried well, smell/taste loss brain tissue loss *preliminary* findings. Now, know vaccinated worse (check flair), yet I'd like know risk knocked fully vaccinated. Then, I'll eased COVID cases around cops dumb enough get vaccine, natural selection solve problem. delta variant fucking around. Definitely relevant comparison infectious disease Deadlier where??? would Americans afraid problem thats really even considering like 70% vaccinated? live US..  article saying indication half new cases vaccinated people.

Bullshit Full vaccination Pfizer seems provide 88% efficacy delta variant. Moderna likely similar. drop original strain protection huge. Thanks!

You’re right, that’s great read! It’s interesting see scientists working scrambling understand adapt covid back early days. remember CDC saying virus wasn’t airborne looking number infected dead NY City. thought myself, well... people either collectively picking noses subway, thing air. bought masks despite told idiot so. It’s good science back vague animal sense things. 

Glad learning lot disease transmission general. I'm anti-vax all. normal vaccines well annual flu shots. I'm cautious around new products. seen real world results showing previously infected person would significantly protected getting vaccinated. Without that, would want vaccinated?

Just tired articles completely ignore way protected. guess probably want admit previous infection comparable vaccinated reason. Tdap! Fair enough. there's always something worry about. far news vaccine's efficacy almost universally positive, even better vaccines way. Americans spoiled, entitled babies. long shot. comes Delta variant. We're going learn effective vaccine many die refused get vaccinated. Um.....why simple covid test good enough? Let's keep eye numbers. feel bad young children aren’t old enough vaccinated parents struggling choices risks take unvaccinated kids. I'm less inclined workers wearing to. places workers are? Absolutely. Yeah it’s insane Easily thirty seconds research destroy ignorance. Vaccine available agegroup workclass time contracting covid That's mood. sucked knowing sent work pandemic without vaccine. 


Then sucked felt like nobody really seemed get people still leaving houses living pre-pandemic life job deemed expendable. 


And sucked prioritized vaccine work put effort get us vaccine, even though required building make money.

&amp;#x200B;

You get used it. wish people thought that. Instead seems “Oh dont want take vaccine? Lets ban work public places put registry do”

It’s asinine. Leave people alone make decisions. It’s way get unvaccinated mask up. also checking vaccine cards that’s harder implement. 

In article saying indication half new cases vaccinated people. It’s didn’t recommend kids get all, simply said vaccine supply prioritized older risk people. Vaccines exist then. Normal low summer number plus vaccines trick. love places say vaccinated walk around,kiss,hug everything zero ways know someone vaccinated. Lmao covid symptoms, reported vaccination. I've twice. fun either time. live, there's less 22% people fully vaxed. closing 2weeks second shot. I'm taking chances people run around screaming anti-vax rhetoric. Well, Covid pretty harmless lot people. Accepting fact also getting vaccinated mutually exclusive.  true even vaccines. city even remotely dead.  Better safe sorry. wear scuba suits shower.  made guffaw. Thanks! course did. someone living Bulgaria, vaccine skepticism much prevalent neighbours? Bulgaria capacity given least 70 doses per 100 people. Even exclude EU member states, like Romania, Greece Hungary, still lag quite significantly behind even Albania, Turkey Serbia. makes Bulgarians much anti-vax neighbours? Bulgarians ""bad"", they're definitely unique notable rate skepticism. better US. sight, mind. MIL happy wouldn’t let anyone else near infant one year old. 

“But I’m bubble!”

Yeah bubble like 50 strangers; knows interact with. 

Got vaccine? Sure come over. held parents standard. want over. bad, not. I'm vaccinated. I'm going back normal life. Well, excuse find anecdote credible, then. :shrug: Especially runs we've seen far large studies. pandemics end, one way Smart people. case diseases kill hosts quickly asymptomatic spread. cases, less deadly strain competitive advantage.

Covid like that. point. seems new retort anti-vaxxers is, ""You got vaccine, care do?"" 
 
The answer is, chances virus replicate, chances mutate. That's many variants right now. knows sort variant (they're talking ""delta-plus variant"", example) hear next? 
 
Last thing want see point variant current vaccines suddenly **not** effective against. we're back square one. That's I'm asking - always knew vaccine 100% wanted take precautions despite fully vaccinated myself, family almost fully too. talk encouraging vaccines amongst friends families, like stats least observations go along I'm saying. Friends starting travel overseas want understand stats going around. craziest part me. like, think literally killing you? can't handle lack common sense taken country. miss point advertising vs real data comparison. LOL! Ty that. I'll pass Unca George! Downvoted saying see children outside..lol. kids JUSD Northern California, testing wasn’t required site testing twice week kid get tested eligible win prizes. school 2 positive tests 1500 tests 2 months period. School negative test results gone now. see response person below. Try get 2nd one close 3 weeks first can, earlier 3 weeks. endocrinologist also seen uptick kids diagnosed t1 diabetes. 

But hey, lifelong disabilities illnesses count... I'm fully vaccinated. I'll staying Iran couple months, folks aren't. safe eat restaurants, keep home food? Here's ""cricket"" you:

With mRNA vaccine--such Pfizer's--when injected arm, assumption intention lipid nano particles encasing mRNA express mRNA cells within injection site. reality studies coming showing lipid nano particles along mRNA found concentrated basically organs including brain. question this: evidence mRNA expressed cells outside arm injection site? so, would problematic want mRNA expressed brain cells, example. brain cells would express coronavirus spike protein per mRNA instructions, thus provoking immune response causing immune system attack kill cells.

I'm worried something like could, THEORETICALLY, contribute degenerative mental disease like Alzheimer's many years road, example.

If answer is, ""No, that's happens; seeing inactive remnants liquid nano particles mRNA flushed system""--or SOMETHING--that would solve issue me. information seem exist anywhere. does, there's way sure.  know enough wait evidence playing safe upon. Anyone feel free call paranoid fully agree. Bc people dumb Nope, sounds like someone may illegal cloning. reporter investigate, it? 

Also, pretty common publish data one database eventually update update once, rather multiple data multiple versions them. 

There plenty reasonable logical explanations this. I'll see dig somewhere, main points backed article New York Times: (about original issues las autumn)

...and additionally link US federal agency: (about issues spring)

You might well read links instead long ramblings. Antivaxxers posit vaccines designed reduce population going happy. theory going come true, unfortunately going part population decimated. COVID-19 pandemic caused approximately 375,000 deaths United States 2020. 

We roughly ... 225,000 deaths united states 2021. 

So Covid deadlier parts world, starting dwindle US. 

I'm vaccinated, I'm feeling pretty good. 

It would cool folks conservative corners US would step start making PSA's types concerted efforts get supporters start getting vaccinated tho. 

In MN, rural population getting vaccinated good rate, Delta variant gonna coming them. Yea sure, 100% agree. live work make two five appts one, can't say sure ever make one own. Also, every woman circle friends made appts SOs well, sad useless men lives, still really pathetic widespread. 

I definitely try best wife mother sometimes pick battles. Unlikely since CDC trust already quite low flip flopping make matters worse them. they’ve done really good job far acting swiftly taking chances greatest health emergency lives. We’re talking masks here. Easy stuff. lockdowns. hate feel self conscious wearing mask public.

Ffs, people pretend like 500,000+ people die.

Like, I'm glad vaccinated, would love wear mask, whatever happened layers protection? ounce prevention worth pound cure? immune response last resort, line defense. Because, ""if someone dies covid US counting that"" Dr. Brix  *reaches shotgun* Vaccinations people won’t take. We’re falling short proposed July 4th goal.

All need imbecile antivax idiots cook vaccine resistant variant back square 1. put quotation marks around ""forget"". Narrator: be. attractive mean attractive everybody. Everyone company eager get back office many us young started jobs fresh college. gotten chance interact colleagues person isolating experience stuck small, dark room alone day every day. mention training feels like difficult thing world virtual format. Sounds like one pushing narrative suits interests. Quite certain 50% includes *very mild* cases, would counted asymptomatic [in mRNA test, 1 symptom counted]. Speaking terms personal risk, wrong though?

Yup. vaccines give 95+% protection even catching current crop variants, catch it, similar level protection death hospitalization.

I personally know half dozen people hospitalized able go back work months recovery. sense taste messed up, get tired much quicker, presumably lung damage.

The vaccines protect death, necessarily permanent consequences. think lot people start opting masks drowsy allergy medicine Trevor Bedford [recent tweet thread gave following summary [in look like rapidly become dominant variant US. know however much surge expect due it. We've steady decline national case counts. I'd expect decline least slow tail follow UK reverse.

We're currently seeing start surge Israel pronounced surge UK. seen US yet, short version one quite sure future happen due conditions different somehow.

The worrying early data US charts like showing Delta (purple) clearly increasing quickly filter rest COVID cases... hard tell sure much adding cases happened opposed replacing cases would different variant Delta around. looking countries guess there's enough former matter.

Vaccine evasion seem major issue moment (Pfizer claiming 88% Delta opposed 95% original study, remember vaccines work well 100%), there's vaccines approved children 12, there's plenty unvaccinated hosts available virus. would gotten idea??? Yet people keep touting, “99.7% people fine Covid.” ignorance. It’s death rate. wish public attention put people alive dealing long term damage. Put numbers Covid dashboards. Hospitalizations, Deaths, “suffered cardiovascular damage” see you’re downvoted. don’t know sub ignores serious effects arise even mild cases. vaccinated good it’s quite enough avoid really bad stuff even don’t really bad case COVID first. I’m vaccinated people important me? reaction. think may happened channel gained bunch subscribers Trump still office stayed downvote Biden-era content. believe never made new channel official channel white house, regardless office.

Meanwhile, first week July lot people still get second dose resulting lot new jabs five weeks later on.

Yeah do. great aunt told thinks doctors aborting 2 year old babies murder. tried explain definitely thing, alas, amount evidence explanation sway her. lady 1 lung refuses get vaccinated thinks dangerous.

I can't find information online. According Bloomberg we've hit 2.8 Billion worldwide doses!

Days from:

0-200M: 68 days

200-400M: 26 days

400-600M: 15 days (April 1st)

600-800M: 12 days (April 13th)

2.6 - 2.8B: 4 days (June 24th)

Wow, amazing say least, mean we're giving 50M/day, currently 42.6M/day (and extra doses carried 2.6B), mean praiseworthy. China updated first doses number, we're likely 25% whole world least one dose.
