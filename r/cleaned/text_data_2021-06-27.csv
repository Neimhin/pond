That said, practical proof experience non-EU citizens get EU DCC well. I'm German citizen, parents not. got EU DCC, able request parents well. issued couple days waiting.

The article also incorrect Covishield vaccine eligible EU DCC since exactly parents got EU DCC for. mention member states able issue EU DCC _any_ vaccine, like Hungary going issue Sputnik, contingent upon visited EU state accept reject specific vaccine (if approved EMA).

The Covishield version AZ vaccine accepted EMA. I've checked laws recently Austria Italy, drove (no parents me), listed Covishield valid brand.

I also know Americans got vaccinated there, resident Germany, able get EU DCC. government US doesn’t cover healthcare is… Fully vaccinated folks protected feel safe, 55% Americans yet. Vaccines don’t protect Delta much Alpha, vaccinated folks infected transmit readily, even asymptomatic. population-wide perspective, still significant outbreaks Delta compared Alpha, especially among unvaccinated. Yes, reason poor adults poor countries need kids. it’s dangerous kids Nothing article good. It’s Moscow it’s Petersburg hosted six Euro 2020 matches welcome quarterfinal game Friday. Spectator numbers capped, authorities still expect 26,000 people city's main believe explosion new infections since mid-June due so-called delta variant, first discovered India. Got it. Thank you. want people prohibitive medical conditions feel guilty/attacked, top feel terrified they're protected vaccine. large amount studies done specifically Delta variant, article about. know 79% effective infections (including asymptomatic) indicating indeed reduce transmission. Notice says “not yet clear” terms efficacy, information available. vaccine shown highly efficacious reducing transmission ancestral variants, similar efficacy numbers symptomatic infection delta.

Context everything, ignored twice. answer is, again, posted misinformation. Ah! body ""fighting"" vaccine components ""direct action"" vaccine. That's good hear, thought vaccine ""aggressive"" potentially harmful chemicals. Thank answer, I'll keep mind choose take vaccine. Exactly. received Indian version UK pissed stops travelling easily EU.  look flu shots surprised what's going on. believe trying limit public gatherings ultimately futile self defeating. could found way make gatherings safer- moving many gatherings possible outdoors, example, helping gathering spaces improve ventilation- lot people would tolerated kinds interventions lot longer. 

I believe lot resistance we’ve seeing things like masks even vaccinations nothing post hoc justifications people desperate need in-person human connection. 

I believe it’s fair say many Redditors type require much less human contact average person, leading severely underestimate lengths people would go obtain contact (I’ve tried pointing multiple times lonely depressed people make bad decisions told video chats good enough, lot Redditors, genuinely is). 

So, bars restaurants small retail stores schools churches barbershops closed down. People start going weeks, months, feeling isolated, rarely seeing people seeing small number neighbors. Eventually people snap start hosting small gatherings home, without guidance safely possible… second wave, third, fueled mainly small in-home gatherings. 

I’m even going touch inconsistent way certain things labeled essential things labeled non essential, way public officials kept getting caught breaking rules, leading people incorrectly assuming rules empirical basis could safely ignored. 

I remember first heard AIDS crisis, abstinence way guarantee ones safety AIDS. true… super helpful, lot people willing practice abstinence unknown time period, possibly forever. Telling people use condoms get tested regularly worked lot better, even abstinence much much safer condoms. 

In way, could advising churches bars best way improve ventilation helping move outside. could telling people open windows set box fans going host Thanksgiving. could treated people like intelligent grownups agency instead children needed hide blankets danger passed. actually ended happening many people ignored maximalist positions public health officials advocated, nobody trusts anybody anymore. 

If can’t force people want- can’t, aren’t enough cops America force everybody behave reasonably really don’t want to- *convince* behave close way want possible. 

I think Terry Pratchett described politics kind like dairy farmer- figure get maximum amount milk minimal amount moo. Well, milk much moo, helps nobody. Gottlieb?? known long time. 1918 Spanish Flu Tanzania 50% people infected developed central nervous system disorders left fatigue bad even harvest crops. also developed melancholy, described depression back then. wish could precise like saying vaccine decreases infection 10% 95%. possible transmit obvious 100% protection. Right, ""spreading"" making covid cases. Covid cases, however, largely flat significant threat public. That's lie. federal initiative health insurance companies cover 100% government would reimburse them. make phone call two Well..can't use Scotiabank Arena anything else....\*cries blue white\* Yes. deferral. Testing good. Unless I’m missing something.  things considered, 2 people , relatively age, need ICU care, one vaccinated, intentionally, was, someone's gotta get bed. Someone make call gets it. difference one vaccinated one isn't, yeah, vaccinated person get bed. give new liver drink. get pushed back list. Man literally asking source. Chill. Again, *fully vaccinated* people shown high risk long COVID. Also, article June 2020 concerns mild COVID unvaccinated people. see think it. updated last year. I’m surprised hasn’t movement towards already, especially many single employer funded insurance plans. couple people group hospitalized Covid must ridiculously expensive small plan. Rule 1: Keep discussion civil. Thank you. I'm surprised high numbers corona cases UK coupled incredibly low rate death hospitalization seen GOOD news people. Exactly. I’m going hold them.   wish would walk-out somehow set financially burdens. small counties deserve nurses doctors. What? Need advice. tested positive (after fully vaccinated March) according health department good stop isolating tomorrow.

Although protected unvaccinated person, mean bathe COV2-delta (or even plain COV2 original flavor) come away experience guaranteed without infection. 

Now say care vaccination protects serious illness death, fair enough. personally want risk longer term issues COVID, like see even ""mild"" covid.

A slight exaggeration, perhaps. almost every headline ever slightly exaggerated best. gonna happen. Festival season almost over. things need planned advance. I’m fairly certain festivals going happen 2022 though. Doesn’t depend type vaccine? hope others support kind universal healthcare favor denying treatment some.

Why stop people vaccinated, refusing treat alcoholics, overweight, smokers sounds like good idea well. Let em fuck around whatever. Yeah mean there's nothing catching another apartment unit move wear N95 24/7 even home. seems pop time time Korea also really good covid numbers whole time. common, expect much higher covid numbers Korea cities everywhere. even close numbers needed. vaccines given 2 billion people 1 million (EMA reported 18 fatalities vaccines 25 million vaccinated) severe deadly side effects. 

Don’t listen idiots, you’re likely die car accident go grocery shopping vaccine. Don’t go looking social media advice whether take vaccine. Read reputable sources like CDC EMA consult physician.

I also noticed randomly things taste correct, sort like lose sense taste never returned 90% time dont issues that.

I also noticed everything sweeter too, like used awful drinking much soda eating many sweets since caught covid, every day eat drink less less find sweet... thankfully meat still good I'd probably die 😆 say P1 killing prior infected individuals? Also plenty scientists disputed methods claimed high prevalence Manaus massive reinfections. nominate government job providing service. counting virus evolve less deadly/more contagious time, seem lowering death rate Lmao, Springtucky.

Edit, found preprint compared infection rate 2,195 individuals received single dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) infection rate 21,950 unvaccinated, propensity-matched individuals February 27th April 14th 2021. 1,779 vaccinated individuals least two weeks follow-up, 3 (0.17%) tested positive SARS-CoV-2 15 days vaccination compared 128 17,744 (0.72%) unvaccinated individuals (4.34 fold reduction rate). corresponds vaccine effectiveness 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%) preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection onset least two weeks vaccination. data consistent clinical trial-reported efficacy Ad26.COV2.S preventing moderate severe COVID-19 onset least 14 days vaccine administration (66.9%; 95% CI: 59.0-73.4%).

Lots reports covid causing blood clots, aneurysms,amputations, organ failure etc. US. grappling deadly third wave due, part, slow vaccination drive. 14% adult population received one dose.

What even talking about? Kids die Covid. spend months hospital, week. Stop lies. 

I've looked data. you? Tell percentage kids long term symptoms Covid. tell changes Delta variant. I'll make prediction: tell me, either unfamiliar data, like says. Prepare new variant Russia actually super important point people. literally walk right pharmacy counters almost anywhere get shot waiting $0. 

Also good idea schedule second shot right get reminders it’s due. Totally agree seen Fast 9 today. know movies going overboard, Fiero rocket ship? L fucking L great. Covid months ago. figured I’d ride antibody protection Fall case vaccine needs tweaked newest strain. Kinda like different flu shot year— think something similar Covid next years. get vaccine— holding months. I'm pretty sure keep social distancing fully vaccinated. reliable study I've seen Scottish COVID-19 hospital admission approximately doubled Delta VOC compared Alpha VOC, risk admission particularly increased five relevant comorbidities.

The actual hazard ratio 1·85 (95% CI 1·39–2·47). fuq  Post text. really fascinating many people understand difference travel ban lockdown. Latest PHE data showing protection hospitalization higher Delta Alpha, efficacy symptomatic infection 79% including AZ (which lower efficacy) Pfizer/Moderna remain highly effective Delta. vaccinated, concern you. opinion every reasonable public health expert well, it’s supported robust data. 619,000 deaths 910 deaths. 

3 covid related deaths last 8 months. 

It works.  current vaccine doesn't. assume update either. think get covid multiple times time want playing Russian roulette better immunity vs. long term damage death.

What mega clusterfuck species helped instigate  lot experts think so. rural pockets seemed escape thus far without vaccines, it’s looking like they’re borrowed time I'm ok it. believe death penalty, even psychopathic narcissists. whoa Good you. clarification note 4: young children also cannot get vaccine yet. running studies 2 above. 2 going even away. Like Family tree guess could DEAD? even think comment write intending placing burden someone state obvious? don’t see downside headline. Maybe hype ""think children"" camp loosening covid restrictions low vaccine uptake areas. Nothing seems get people arms much ""think children"", whether that's good cause bad cause.  European deferred programs

And ""some,"" mean like 2 3 countries. Plenty European countries similar policies.

Many countries without blanket deferrals write rules basically ban MSM X months. Since majority epidemiologists agree it’s matter time virus matures enough render current vaccines effectiveness 50% I’m genuinely perplexed flat denial? saying Delta worst mutation we’ll see? assume current vaccinations providing adequate responses don’t even 12 month data trial participants yet know one haven’t tested. also know since majority world yet vaccinated potential evading mutations remains high. Vaccines given general public 6 months we’re 24 months novel virus still learning about. It’s little early evolutionary development speak absolutes. many people fully vaccinated? No, get COVID documented cases second infection killing. Delta new name Indian variant.  Wonder, know rate Infection? stupid beginning british government didnt enforced harder limitations. mean crazy open Pubs Clubs sit crap oO  pretty violent protests Europe.... think medical system got overwhelmed, would lived better times (if access better care) died. Yeah imma need source bud LOL that’s true, south. Yeah basically would unlikely spike protein different since that's attack mechanism Another major vegan introvert here, initially holding many initial concerns, ultimately fell wayside indomitable logic. Glad one came conclusion.  pandemic never end. require us get annual vaccines like flu shot control it. Vaccinated people need care, unvaccinated adults obviously already care. guess leaves people kids young get vaccinated? wait get shot. became available last month area doctor wanted wait till little later pregnancy. fully support vaccination yet, waiting line get vaccine, got scared. woman behind started telling get phizer, moderna, moderna worse. fully understood phizer moderna mRNA vaccines would similar side effects. found asking nurse moderna safe, even though logical brain knew better. social creatures fear spreads like wildfire. didn’t background medical research, don’t know I’d vaccinated right now. Well travel ban can't really work people still travel they? callous thing could possibly wrote. You’re willing risk child’s limbs someone else’s?  Thanks! get second Friday! much easier second time book.  96% American physicians vaccinated though What? still people arriving Australia overseas. Citizens returning home, people special work permits, people left compassionate reasons. Thanks!   real though, insurance companies could start charging higher premiums companies without mandatory vaccinations, least discounts high vaccination rates. That's probably way make happen. People really happy Venezuela though government started promoting vaccine. It’s political. didn’t approve Astrazeneca batch way, months ago, political BS, long explain here. 

The trust vaccine countries living regimes almost zero. Pfizer. nothing somewhat sore arm. even bad. That's symptom doses. everyone people know convinced drink bottle pedialyte day day 2nd shot. may coincidence, though, people kind-of sore arm maybe fatigue next day. immunocompromised patients work with, thank so, much getting shot. Better late never. You’ll helping save life life others Yeah, think point “If fully vaccinated, lot protection,” still remains. perfect, think goal anymore.

I meet lot people outside sub use (much lower) possibility fully vaccinated people getting ill bad news, really good could hoped. It’s better start imperfect UBI make better rather keep using programs ineffective delta doubling every month cases flat variants going make difference, soon variants gone delta still doubling. It'll start threat doubles enough times case India, sick/deaths due lack vaccination? Good question. won’t make look good I’ll honest

Yes, want people get vaccinated getting bad case COVID lingering effects. getting vaccine time avoid Fall surge clearly choice person making (in US rate). can't, try, save every single person price freedom. Im stil surprised size, last heard regulatory agencies requiring small trials approval, even multiple arms seems quite large funny US it, uncontrolled reason like pandemic count accurate, another country, fuck pandemic, undercounting shit definitely saving face, nothing pandemic. don’t mind trash takes curb, unfortunately stink way there. That's important point. reports cases milder symptoms experience persistent people touting hospitalizations even though cases up, that's good news one hand, enough data understand infection impact us long-term, longer year more.

Another study says one ten long-term effects 8 months following mild 10 odds want play around with. could mild infection, like bad cold, also 1 10 chance losing sense taste smell almost year. think need careful disregard cases asymptomatic, mild, hospitalizations low. still problem. I’m gunea pig Texas. Unvaxxed unmasked. I’ll let know live. wouldn’t? got December. vaccinated month first symptomatic got covid twice, separately? confirmed, thought like eight known people people “reinfected” later actually sick infection. test DNA believe determine they’re two individual infections simply reoccurrence. right, changed semantics ""information"" ""data"" realize it. Good call out. I'm genuinely trying obstinant. OP feels safer following new advice that's great them. 

In mind really trying ask scientific data action based keep hearing alarm bells halls Israel UK yet hard data receiving essentially good news (beyond Delta greater danger unvaxed people). I've trying figure data behind shifts mentality here, far advice extent it. Intelligence gap South 2nd dose early january? get first then? US massive undercounting like everyone else.

I think irresponsible open without careful study risks. right approach. Daycares even staff fully vaccinated. sarcastic comments. Australia's economy fully rebounded past 2019 levels. seems like continue going quite well keeping virus totally eliminated. 

Meanwhile western countries lost hundreds thousands lives, required massive trillion dollar injections cash keep economies afloat, still seeing historically high unsustainable employment levels. real question is--how long countries go suffering lackluster pandemic response? Fuck. What's vaccination situation Australia?  Yeah I’m wearing mask anymore
After 2 weeks. People aren’t even vaxed aren’t wearing it. Tired always bring considerate one. barely breathe work first sequenced UK April. OG delta still winning hands probably transmissible. still speculation, slightly meaningful nonetheless. Cheers.

They freaking *vaccine lung cancer*. unbelievably state agree, let's go one roll National Guard shots. choice--you get get back life.  hilarious 😂 thanks chuckle doesn’t “not trusting vaccine,” “understanding vaccines work”. It’s definitely better vaccinated unvaccinated. No, mRNA vaccines provide far effective long lasting immunity disease especially newer variants - antibodies original likely protect much, Delta.

Where risk? 280 million Indians got vaccine yet 26 got clots. Yeah, would make sense lived rural area super low vaccine rates I'm willing bet paranoid people live places like Seattle Boston high vaccine rates virus pretty much eradicated. become psychological problem point. Yeah fully vaxxed done mask unless place insists. 30% vaccination rate area vaccines widely available long, that's unconscionable. I'm really sorry.

Some friends boat regarding kids. country we've vaccinating oldest youngest, we've started vaccinating people ages 35-39, people 35 vaccinated unless work hospitals schools, kids vaccinated all, we're getting lot Delta variant transmission among teens young adults. parents protect kids? far go? idea.

Basic mechanism is:

- vaccine spreads unvaccinated area becomes endemic
- makes lots copies, including mutant lines
- constantly tested vaccinated populations come contact sick populations
- version even slightly better resistance vaccine competitive edge spread more
- repeat

Lol Maybe won't. understanding person replying outlining scenario second infection could kill even partially immune making less severe. Exactly. hate narrative switched cases, rather something really matters like hospitalization. someone get vaccinated reduce risk?

But getting covid create antibodies people risk-reducing effects. Getting covid 2nd time death sentence, it? smaller, prettier, friendlier, less corrupt version sully twust accent. 10 days level immunity starts kick in.

Congrats almost over. However balanced opposite direction people die, covid, 28 days.

Well pacing China US, saying. thought green pass given people received vaccine EU/EEA country. vaccines given anywhere EU/EEA, non issue.  vaccine(Pfizer) start effective?

Just go first one today. still get corona next two weeks?

When consider bit ""safe""? must way contagious

It is. reason UK cases growing exponentially (faster higher anywhere else Europe) despite us 60% adults fully vaccinated 20% first dose.

With older variants would enough snub out, delta variant...  Haven’t UK Canada also administered well? know UK given 5million these, people vaccine passport EU well? Yes, every vaccine I’ve memory person administering asked arm preference, ones went arm. would really nice true. Europe’s new ‘vaccine passport’ programme ... includes Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine version manufactured India – Covishield you! good. Think Pfizer better rated honestly, take offered. There’s lot immunity antibodies! soldiers stand body remembers.. Yes, absolutely. let know. They're offering second jabs UK first one 21+ days ago couple walk centres. Usually 8-12 weeks.

Even then, there’s compulsion OP respond, could well lied whatever flattering sequence events wanted transmit. addition, OP said introverted make talking feelings thought processes daunting, sometimes.

Overall, wanted charitable shower OP praise finally getting vaccine. costs nothing. I’m going niggardly ration compliments; you’re free so, prerogative. Aha, okay -- definitely know that. forgot Oregon's horrible racist history. Cannot believe shit still endures. Though, live Boston area stuff endures here, too... stuff tied together makes physically uncomfortable. vaccine get good vaccine.

The difference mainly lower efficacy vaccine, need doses achieve effect society level. think supply issue, mRNA vaccines slightly effective, mixing AZ/mRNA may even effective. Sinovax shows 50% efficacy real world along troubling evidence coming may last months. It’s garbage vax compared anything even worse Sputnik vax. It’s pretty general consensus lockdowns work

Only look lockdowns failed variety reasons applicable Australia:

 - little restrictions
 - Start late
 - End early
 - encapsulate infected area
 - exist zero-covid background
 - restrict quarantine incoming travel

Australia seen many lockdowns cities, every time brought case numbers back 0. Canada mixing vaccines heavily. Europe. assume American? Terrific, imbeciles country take two shots pandemic, god knows even fewer every season. want go vacation lol Exactly. inhale virus, got swabbed right time, test positive it, immune system would take care made sick, enough replicating able pass someone else. 

Most vaccines work way. Ever heard herd immunity? u got sick brother via sick girlfriend who’s parents literally live Hubei province travelled back Canada mid Nov 2019. combined evidence also supports timeline existence personally knowing well body works interacts timeframes every regular sickness , KNOW it. 
Not sure think gain suggesting don’t know it’s surely helpful party talk asses without evidence...like receipts brought. PH getting injected Sinovac lol Considering people got COVID multiple times (not vaccinated) I’d say it’s durable protection get vaccine July 19th well 90% adults vaccinated least one dose. I'm sure else point.  headline makes sound like playing Djokovic. even conservatives, biggest anti vax communities liberal minority communities Well work reacting ever-changing consensus. Updated policy/messaging want see means paying attention reacting new information. I'm sure sarcasm not, July 19th almost 60% UK population fully vaccinated, 50, group makes 90% existing hospitalizations deaths, vaccination rates 95%. Medical environments would good application.

Pretty much anywhere it’s viable get rapid antigen test constantly there’s higher risk exposure. actually zero evidence stronger immune response, vaccine immunization aquired infection. 

You pushing misinformation telling people need get vaccinated need get vaccinated, exactly much hesitation vaccine. 

Stop pushing false information. made AZ's cell cultures AZs input. guess EU would issues QC, normally tough generics general.  ""this fauci guy"" lol made laugh. first  pick sarcasm think says lot topic/sub. well could 100% serious post. Well played.  That’s herd immunity for. Let people get shots get them, can’t (immunocompromised such) also stay protected. Pfizer Moderna also reported 100% protection death. problem media (and people general) took numbers irrefutable proof getting vaxxed meant covid kill you, without taking account sample size. Hell, people even know confidence interval is. can't believe people still this. Come close contact someone covid likely get regardless vaccine taken. I’ve seen several virologists advance hypothesis last year. 60% single jab, completed. ~34% completed track mid August 70% total population completed vaccinations. EU whole even away 49% single, 31.5% double jab. talking grandma phone like idk Fauci guy keeps changing story. like uh yes? changes advice obtains new information? Like scientist?? attacking virus. Think infection antibodies work. There’s antibodies row like NFL linemen base nose throat waiting block virus. Rather, virus gets body, begins infecting cells antibodies within jump action. immune response antibodies body dictate course illness one. act fast you’re totally asymptomatic. don’t get sick.

In reality everyone vaccine get “infected” COVID would probably test positive point. majority won’t register anything beyond cold. It’s totally fine mix two doses AZ Pfizer/Moderna. clinical trialed that, actually turned slightly better two either one. She’s good.  understand many countries low fully vaccinated Great cannot make different public roles vaccinated non-vaccinated people. However, think know virus, outdoor transmission really nil think mask mandates outdoors actually backfire ways, make people forget true risk trying keep things really risk like outside public beach guy flew Hawaii country literally burning.

so way Fosters ""Australian beer""... sounds like Scott Morrison ""Australian Ted Cruz"" XD love Boris thinks tell Covid show's over.

/UK doomed Commented article literally may need booster shots means pharma sells fewer vaccines. article said 50% new cases Israel people already vaccinated.

This misleading statistic.

If 95% people vaccinated, could 500 vaccinated get sick, 500 vaccinated get sick (ie 50%).

But 100,000 people, that's 0.5% vaccinated getting sick, 10% unvaccinated getting sick.

The odds dramatically different, 50-50. Ok, thanks info. dont specific data show you, one unfortunate rare cases.  
  
How make claim certainty breath say can't show specific data?  sure got voted got sick February 2020 nowhere, usually don’t get sick fine. Covid hit wore mask faithfully got first shot Moderna felt like death seven days after. never tested positive assumed bad reaction first shot. nowhere near 70% total population vaccinated end July I'm going eligible. currently quite far 70% total end August let alone July. office exactly that, right highly contagious delta variant hitting everyone hard. Oh, we're required wear masks boot, prove we're vaccinated. guess logic pay people retirement they're dead. Sadly, stay power long plays China card. I’m sure J&amp;J Canada got first Astra Zeneca shot wanted mRNA second, could. Seems perfectly safe mix, sure would work full course though., Canada, anyone received AstraZeneca shot choose get Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca 2nd dose. declared safe NACI, take that. breakthrough infection occurs, theoretically spread infected. said, [recent research shows vaccine notably reduces risk household transmission 40-50% compared unvaccinated individuals. There’s still lot kids without it, globally lot people don’t access get second wednesday want day work case get sick. cash sadly. Masks distancing never actually *did* work *all well.* Covid denier, even saying wrong things do, clear. best mitigation strategies had, *at time.* efficacy wearing mask standing apart never anywhere close efficacy even modest vaccine. 

People clinging masks correct *largely* doesn’t hurt anything wear it. (With exception people lip read understand speech, certain sensory processing challenges make difficult wear something face, etc.,) wouldn’t venture harass someone choosing wear one, thinking that’s really much, especially you’re fully vaccinated, verges magical thinking security blanket. Natural immunity, esp toward variants, nearly good vaccinations. literally solution problems sitting right front us. people get dumb little shot. make everyone sit wait vaccine case, history. non-American, remember reading article discussed easy predict political affiliation truthfully answered questions. think there's better example COVID ancillary issues, e.g. vaccines masks.

It's incredibly bizarre could mistake vaccination heat map electoral one. like country divided can't agree basic fundamental realities. realize particularly novel observation, unfathomable politics divided almost define terms opposition one another. apologies, sarcastic! People tend downvote signal moderators comment may sound bit ""anti-vax"", even true information (like one shared), even obviously ""anti-vax"".

The days nuanced opinions over, seems like people ""pick side"" every single matter society. Ugh can't public figures level headed realistic. man Scott love r/Coronavirus! brave young man. literal fiction works ammunition them, wouldn’t worry stuff like giving ammunition.

I *would* agree though it’s fatiguing try keep stuff. tough one something I’m curious well. case maybe many people died last year died “with covid”. news going go well covid deniers. guess need actual studies looking rather raw numbers. I’m feeling like raw numbers becoming useless people vaccinated coming “maybe” milder cases covid. Mixing Moderna &amp; Pfizer would even less riskier mixing AZ Pfizer. largely indistinguishable immunological perspective use mRNA technology. AstraZenca vaccine, hand, employs chimpanzee adenovirus. different compared Pfizer &amp; Moderna. Yeah went compulsory (public school thank you) university south (FL). take bullshit, feel reflection pessimistic attitude towards moving south going school there, actual content schooling.

I phenomenal educators teach levels. great, wanted graduate. went great PUBLIC university graduation PUBLIC school, went graduate time highly competitive engineering degree less 15k debt.

I’m saying it’s great - isn’t. I’m saying popular take shitting south lame. live west now, know what? Reminds lot Florida.  Nobody says doesn't, rare. reason news story extremely rare. 

Kids likely killed seriously injured car accident Covid. people double vaxxed still die covid. small minority, yes, let disease ravage unvaccinated populations mutuate percentage could get bigger. Isn’t what’s happening delta variant right now? That’s it’s crucial many people get shot possible   original Pfizer readout interim P3 results indicate 95% effective preventing infection. 95% effective preventing moderate severe illness. fact didn’t test regularly asymptomatic infection all. 

I’m interested got numbers    Correct. Part danger contagiousness spread levels. 

Kids much danger dying smallpox right now, they? actually [a separate trial happening moment.

COV-Boost working boosters combine best base vaccines, ComFluCOV figuring whether boosters given alongside flu vaccine without anyone imploding side effects damaging efficacy either vaccine. Thanks link! helping county’s mass vaccination site. One night end night, literally one dose Pfizer left. went around checked volunteers see anybody still unvaccinated. person police officer assigned event. refused vaccine hated needles waiting J&amp;J available him. age limits stepped much. able find person street shot wasn’t wasted, underscore helpful one done shot be. Funny Muricans call Pfizer. It’s biontech. Mine wife's experience:

We sore arm first dose, though tetanus level sore mine minor. second dose, convinced repeatedly move arm full range motion keep blood moving seemed help lot.

Tiredness - first shot minorly tired, second shot far starting 26h after. wife zero tiredness.

Achey - aches first dose either us. Second dose, pretty achey tired went sleep woke next morning perfect health. wife woke middle night aches chills, lasted 24 hours. BBC recently report almost newest fatalities Covid vaccinated?

""Could"" ""does"" different things. idiots covid flu really trust vaccines one knows long term effects trip. delra variant let's loose gonna mayhem It’s like expire. Might well stashed emergency supplies case. Don’t want vaccinate? like don’t access vaccines… probably less anti-vaxxers third world countries actually remember horrible diseases like polio tb eliminated recently thanks vaccines expects cases 10s thousands winter

This might sound like lot, tiny fraction millions flu cases occur every winter. Even Delta variant, hospitalizations U.S. winter likely unvaccinated people elderly preexisting conditions, along handful unlucky young healthy people. precise, mean say they're trying **but failing due govt arrogance incompetence** 

There's difference activity outcome.  wonder endgame countries kept pandemic control via strict border control. Even vaccinated whole population inevitably going large exit wave covid soon open borders. matter slice it, going politically difficult. Yes. Australia could done same, decided to.

Presumably Australia could work Canada get excess supply, wanted. looking like Pfizer anyway, stepdown protection minimal. little worse AstraZenica, definitely bad news fully vaccinated.

And read article, unvaccinated spreading almost exclusively. studies show dramatically reduced chance asymptomatic infections, lower viral load get infected, meaning less infectiousness.

With cloth masks, getting giving little additional protection vaccinated. might able simulate effect herd immunity wear N95 (not loose-fitting KN95 ear loops) take care learn properly fit face. UK, vaccines broken link cases hospitalizations deaths, past outbreaks there, cases went 10,000 day 100,000 (10x), hospitalizations deaths would rise similar multiplier. current Delta-driven outbreak began month ago, cases gone 2000 day around 15,000 day, hospitalizations even doubled, deaths barely changed all. Well thats proof mRNA vaccines work... Im glad got Moderna vaccine described literally every sinus infection I’ve ever had. born lived LA life. Sinus infections hot months basically fact life due rapid air changes indoors AC outdoor heat. 

I’m vaccinated visited LA. cut trip short got sinus infection. Never got tested COVID I’m wondering seasonal infection COVID. frustrating thing even government/health agencies seem making messaging go along. less kind new variant fear point massive institutional freakouts may result in. Could be, know latest update honest know option point. testing takes possible replace one sequence mRNA vaccine another matter weeks.  allows drug companies jump action creating testing vaccines mimic new coronavirus variants arise.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   you’re absolutely correct I’d like point messaging disaster..

The problem medical establishment treating predictions hypotheticals like settled fact instead moving target …. they’re wrong changes look like liar. I’m speaking Fauci scenario general. It’s delivery  4 weeks second shots, 8 AZ, people AZ last 8 weeks anyway.  Delta hysteria really getting hand. Exactly. fact matter is, without extra precautions number kids would die car accidents year would exponentially higher.   opened shitter vaccine astra aged 18 thgh gp . better nothing sure. interesting? Yeah think e things high priority, getting classroom ready. sure masks alone help many classes next outdoor ventilation (windows) overcrowded Delta highly transmissible. 
Besides that, many parents push kids go school even sick 
Not looking fwd J&amp;J? What's person 65's chance spreading COVID catching COVID?

What's person 65's chance spreading COVID vaccinated?

What's person 65's chance death vaccinated? IDGAF I'll take extra boost heck it! always hear work  "" that's way we've always done it""  immediate reply 
"" make right"" 2 weeks 1 week!!   hospitalization rates *up* 1.3 every 100,000 think alarmed this? Agreed situation step child whose father anti vaxx (he got vaccine) pawning mother.(says sterilize them). really frustrating witness first hand stuff. I'm sure scenario playing worldwide. Ok use argument lockdown forever ever? covid never leave reality. drugs b legal  Shit Belgians ahead us! can't let happen, Dutchies!  Delta Airlines: ""Wasn't us, swear!"" pint? seriously, think anyone knows do. 
The thing government failed beginning (and I'm talking UK, majority, all.)
What done identified outbreak. include WHO, this. failed after. variants popping up, biggest thing (various leaders) call variant concern. shit. after? Nada. waited long ban flights infected regions people suffer, potential infection, going back masks, lockdowns protests. Yes shall question, unfortunately stay safe possible obviously sane. *Yes.* “Something something moving goalposts” change guidance based studies much use studies Yoda: another still wish they’d wait us even eligible get second shots. varies province we’re going masks-optional also still making everyone wait 7+ weeks second shots. Kinda sucks re-open well lots people even given opportunity full vaccination. That's debunked. Liberal minority communities low income, conservatives income brackets even less likely get vaccinated. wait see, J&amp;J news like months, finally press release July 2nd J&amp;J effective July 3rd. 

Then we’ll watch everyone BBQing outside 4th windows, dark, wearing masks. Regional lockdowns (like town town basis) maybe. big cities generally high rate vaccination, low risk outbreak even nearby rural areas them.

As hospitals, again, rural areas might cases hospitals handle, nearby cities able take excess patients relieve burden them. I've always felt judge says they're handing unusually hard sentence ""make example"". justice? immediate grounds appeal... started Pfizer 12. less youth option carriers.  several COVID symptoms 15 minute COVID flu tests came back negative. specific, I’ve never felt bad life. yesterday sore throat last night somehow morphed worst symptoms I’ve ever felt. Symptoms include; sore throat, productive coughing, congested nose, runny nose, body aches (neck, jaw, ears, back), splitting headache, weakness (can barely walk anywhere without feeling like ran marathon dizziness, fever. tests came back negative said something viral. do? feel awful job said needed come back work negative. Thanks advance.

Should mention 18 year old female work daycare.  “Only” 2 billion lmao prove negative? 

Here’s February, studies beginning determine happens, but, numbers yet, so…  Man, sucks.

Not situation good job lined Japan waiting nearly 1.5 years enter country (with highly competitive academic fellowship). idea I’ll enter. Maybe sarcastic  Provides ton protection stay away unvaccinated morons Nope. 100% mods wholly embrace natural selection. know better think works. reason shorter interval would make testing process faster, would approved sooner. testing indicated slightly longer interval gives better results, though. Probably multifactorial obesity likely big contributor difference, use oral contraceptives Ok, weird anti American media spin nothing drugs tested globally, reported globally. Data data aggregates levels large ignore reality vaccines great; one UK (AstraZeneca) one US (J&amp;J), one China (Sinovac.) vaccines better: one Germany/US (Pfizer), one Russia, one US (Moderna), one US/Sweden (Novavax), one China (Sinopharm) maybe one Cuba. lesser vaccines protect individual, society allow virus continue spread much greater numbers. need use ones reduce risk greatest degree, would mean lesser versions used better products can't be.

And forget vaccines China ""gave away"" ineffective given back recipient countries like Brazil causing harm good.  considered fully vaccinated week second dose, careful then. Nah, D++ next varient followed D\#.  Reduce transmissions, stop. still infected whilst double vaccinated, far less severe symptoms also reduced transmission chance.  There’s war expertise certain portion United States population. Another reason support animal agriculture. I’ve read flu vaccine protection wanes quickly. point might make sense vulnerable populations get two flu shots per flu season. postpone everything life every time flu season rolls around? not, you’re far paranoid. yes, natural state apparently far paranoid need chill.  Clearly fame isn’t everything. Ty detailed answer, exactly looking for, worries completly unjustified. Here's silver ya! arguably close, saying good would overreaching.

It requires 3 doses, vaccinate significantly fewer people per 1,000 doses, doses given means protection, particularly variants, equivalent 2 dose regime would likely significantly less effective. also much comparable vaccine Novavax, also requires 2 doses efficacy, significantly worse variants.

Overall, 3 dose aspect really dampen ability say good Pfizer. Yes, vaccines work teaching body launch quicker effective response infection, end causes damage replicates enough spread new host. order happen, virus still land start process becoming full-blown infection.  know read graph understand statistics you? Exactly, looney tunes try compare us countries. There's thousands people monthly desperate come country willing risk lives even illegally. thought could somehow cut borders, even wanted to, nuts. Yes, do. literally remove building. double mask wear eye protection. started early never stopped.:) around folks. anonymity internet gives people freedom annoying versions themselves. What's person 65's chance death catching COVID? Dude understand frustration describing held ransom absurd. They’re providing service requires time money charging cover costs 


I’m going show grocery store accuse holding groceries ransom won’t give free. People wearing mask also spread virus. Best way go would live lives virtually. work corporate consulting people fight vaguely suggest process/strategy needs improved barely touched 5 years ago.

i absolutely fucking hate mentality. People apply personal lives, many self improvement self aware modicum emotional intelligence they're year year. come studies Moderna Pfizer? Never see anything J&amp;J.  even question? I've read throughout pandemic virus endemic capacity on. Well. I’m Florida everyone seems pretend like never happened here. don’t get it. Anytime south gets mentioned people lose concept civility here. reason this. Yeah EU targeted 70% first vaccination end July (some high EU people even mentioned mid-July). goal. never said reach 70% fully vaccinated (by end July), think countries target end August/September (by time school starts) 70% fully vaccinated. exports. donations. People buying these. Still great thing US allowing that, donations countries can’t afford vaccines better Dont immune systems that? Hence 14 day qurantines Australia? know, *people* (⸚᷃ )  Use whatever example. wanted create time machine attend Broadway play New York early June?!?!?! 2019, 48 million kids U.S. 11 under. That's almost 15% population. Add immunocompromised people medically advised due medical history get vaccinated I'd wager closer 20% mark, like 65 million humans.  Near zero. tend one shot, indoor environment unmasked long periods maskless people. Basically, give extensive exposure virus. boost CDC opening floor gates unvaxxed people go around unmasked. Seriously? California walk (no appointment) nearly pharmacy get vax. Including grocery store ones, it’s literally location every miles. don’t see state would different, Walmart, Target, major pharmacy grocery chains. It’s 10 inches horizontal 8 inches vertical 

It won’t scan don’t even understand sad can’t guess state bc many would offended this? common knowledge awhile. consider consider California governor said asked would lift emergency Newsom reiterated commitment lifting coronavirus restrictions June 15. noted variants virus still spreading that, combined varying vaccination rates states countries, could require issue new restrictions future.  disease extinguished. It’s vanished; it’s taking summer months off,” Newsom said.

He'll give powers virus ""vanished."" Whether intervened not, unlikely end. kill enough people fizzle own. best hope minimize lives lost long term damage body. 

Johnson Johnson obvious fact give shit anything except money. They're completely neglecting research purpose beyond making money, basically giving middle finger everyone who's vaccinated vaccine. Yeah, dude dedicated entire career infectious disease. *Much* less qualified Kayleigh Facebook!! free guidance:

are vaccinated?

yes chill

no get vaccinated That's reassuring.

Now least flu lasting friendship. positive note, mask sales remain strong. problem someone read tiny bit theory knowing enough. Sometimes little bit knowledge worse none all. wrong because:

 
1. death rate low. also targeted specific demographic, really old, often isolated anyway.

2. COVID robust asymptomatic spread. lot population spreads without even sick, much less dying. 

3. COVID long presymptomic spread. Even people get sick, spread around. 

4. takes actually die COVID part. get spread that. Even hospital, that's wonderful place spread disease. 

5. thing make spread also cause death. Higher viral loads better chances infecting cells cause both, instance. selection pressure, especially points actually select deadly correlates infectiousness. posted before. Go see doctor, man. It’s downvoted can’t provide verified source; e.g. BBC News, Associated Press (AP), Reuters. definitely lmao check post history, wonder shade prefer though lol. fair though, that's virus literal worm haha amount rottenness needs accumulate human brain one thought rumored great actually see x-ray. I’ve seen several subjects, pretty amazing stuff. say like flood lawsuits bad thing. Hundreds thousands people dead. consequences severe.  big talking? Mine wallet size smaller 8.5x11"" paper. Scanned fine ClearPass.

I'm sure FedEx/Staples/OfficeMax whatever copy shop could make shrunken copy layout card different might confuse app. seem different holding phone away. they’re stay. Lmao vaccine yet? ask since OP mentioned getting covid post vaccine. severe seems there's still symptoms wondering loss taste/smell also one them. would really interesting case, got shot recently feel fortunate feel like go back .  News talking 'delta plus' variant. gonna get 'delta pro max' variant? I've Pfizer, going save fortune condoms *Sigh* Interesting; high AZ first, improved response nethertheless. Again, great news AZ takers then!

Also, thanks pointing me, reason brain decided skip it! I’m arguing don’t attempt set public policy protect children die car accidents banning driving would majorly inconvenience society take approach covid. one ever said shouldn’t try protect kids covid Sort like antibodies? Baisc logic way repeating. children infected virus March 1 April 4.

You keep saying like alarming numbers, literally sliver fraction percentage population India. die letality rate low general kids"". Well, argument apply variant anymore.

It absolutely still applies. can't even find numbers kids dying. *because they're dying*. don’t understand they’re still Trump basically every politician love know got vaccinated Yes people better it, might half many. What's wrong trying limit probability dangerous variant? Sounds great theory, we've treated seeing leaders loot public treasury futures decades now. Let's see powerful people make tiniest sacrifice first. happens, like millennials Gen-Zers, I'll working paying student loans. j&amp;j?? Many us got j&amp;J like never including anything. Almost feel like maybe properly vaccinated something still need get one others.

If case hell J&amp;J begin keep trying bring lockdown? nobody discussion bringing lockdowns. 

The person tried say kids die car crashes, therfore protect kids COVID. pointing stupidity argument. Stop trying pretend like conversation something else. could harness pandemic's back forth motion energy. would solve energy crisis... forever. either heard anything regarding JnJ it’s effectiveness delta variant? shot (plus confirmed positive covid months shot) feel good probably pretty safe. sucks. Sorry hear really different countries use different priorities. go strictly age groups, e.g. Germany simply free-for-all now. I'm talking generally higher virulence negative selective pressure. virus also makes fair number people unwell enough reduce much get infect people, increasing virulence negative selective pressure way too. Honestly, work mutations? good it’s efficacy? might think easy answers find, googling doesn’t seem help articles feel like fear porn. Every generation gonna get “boomerish” relation younger gems. it’s way forever wtf pro choice getting vaccinated deadly virus? hope million dollars unicorn, things possible. statistically astronomically unlikely trillions (or more) individual virions around world suddenly simultaneously start producing defective copies can't replicate. would like humans suddenly becoming infertile ending Children Men scenario; going happen without outside influence, like vaccines making impossible virus find new hosts. really public health, journalists work hard get info post private company NYTImes. mean journals, articles illegal public read FBI libgen. way access signing expensive school offer it, medicine school hard get, filter high school matter luck rich parents care you, work healthcare etc.. 
Sure work hard fucking hard fucking get it! Motherfuck  There’s surprisingly large number nurses antivax camp. hospital asked nurse vaccinated yet (it early days) flipped told matter personal freedom wouldn’t getting it. dangerous able smell smoke rotten food… make sure fire alarm works! hell about? China never gave away vaccine doses Brazil. 

We national lab licensed produce Coronavac imported raw materials, bought paid for. doses scrapped returned either, ideia got (or sort damage imagine would caused vaccine, even particularly effective).

There people try choose vaccine they're taking, though, that's true. that's due misinformation 'China vaccine' exposed lots propaganda praising Pfizer. call 'vaccine sommeliers'. Keeping masks then. USA certificate white piece paper anti-counterfeit kind would thought? part ""long asymptomatic presymptomatic) spread yoy understand? Plus, add mild symptoms. covers people. strong evolutionary pressure virus become less deadly. Really gonna start saying people work. ""Well can't one now, sent overseas!"" Better yet, tell they're giving ""illegals"".

Guess state live in. Here's thing - Missouri like New York, live; may ample access &amp; availability vaccine like New York does. I'm giving benefit doubt vaccine like 2 months (Especially since NY one 1st get age/occupation/medical condition restrictions like 3-4 months earlier) - MEANWHILE, face masks &amp; 6 feet apart known 2 years throughout US, genuine excuse. ass mean - read Burnet White, ""Natural History Infectious Disease"" back took evolutionary biology related classes college. 

Maybe said ""as example, killing host..."" talk statistics yet cherry pick outlier validate point. Consider following measles cases year.

Source: Could even RSV, it’s going around lot. responded specifically someone dismissing things car accident example. That's discussion about. problem anti-vaxxers could cause virus mutant point virus breaks vaccines. Right seems unlikely, still possibility. thing there's much change people's minds. protect hope vaccines continue provide protection. far science strongly suggests they're exceeding even expectations. made big deal big deal. 

Let's consider single manufacturing chain produce either Cuban vaccine Novavax vaccine, seeing directly comparable. manufacturer makes Cuban vaccine need produce 50% doses vaccinate number people protection using Novavax vaccine, take 50% time vaccinate number people, 50% money. Consequently, large number people remain completely unprotected longer amount time also get hospitalisations deaths.

That's undesirable. like J&amp;J single dose vaccine offered protection double dose Pfizer AZ, paying nearly much attention Pfizer AZ. would try educate maybe give reading material, wouldn’t work hard…they sound like antivaxxers don’t lot hope come around. 

If vaccinated (family), you’re probably pretty safe, high risk kids something, yeah, wouldn’t risk it. alternative guys could hang socially distanced outdoors- also pretty safe. way tabulating things, Missouri 7.9% positivity rate June 25. Health officials exclude recent three days ensure data accuracy calculating moving positivity rate 4.5% June 1. justice system supposed rehabilitate people lock away quarter life make impossible function finally get out. goal needs show people wrong help improve decision making. person go around murdering people made dumb mistake dealing drugs. study suggests even got covid getting vaccinated offers best protection, I'm sure think anti-vaxxers would ammo reading particular study. guidelines change we're still learning virus effectiveness vaccines. Science always changing, that's happens learn more. got J&amp;J one week like hottest jab town “one done.” 5 days later blood clot scare happened it’s meme vaccine ever since.

Your story story. drove way Salt Lake City (where grew up) California I'm impatient turd wait Pfizer shot.

Waltz convention center hear volunteers say, ""Today first day Johnson Johnson.""

Eff it. drove 600 miles. I'm going home without shot. Whatever fine. permeates culture, actually blame Boomers putting collective psyche effectively. link? Trying caution 81yr father. Thanks!!! whole argument started someone saying 

“and people sub still say doesn’t affect kids”

(Or something along lines - mobile - sorry)

I one brought vaccinating adults alternative protect children (which imply I’m favor that). Maybe agree making different assumptions people sub saying doesn’t affect kids (or doesn’t affect badly enough) I'm surprised prefer anecdotes people fled independent review. told can’t find 

And here’s thing, don’t want gave giant piece paper. card ones ones scan app job using verify vaccinations Antivaxxers stupid though understand science. ignored.

As learn more, expect competing complimentary studies hone truth situation best understand it.

That's science works. deadlier detrimental that. Killing host spread virus means, well, virus spread strain dies out.

This big driver evolution kills 0.5% long periods asymptomatic presymptomic spread like VIRUS.  thinks spent much time playing phone pandemic game. great news suggests even covid still get vaccinated, debunks theory ""I'll get covid, survive it, fine"". Regardless, getting vaccinated must so. people don’t believe based reason. Nothing change mind believe shit isn’t real.  Interesting note, one thing I've trouble smelling COVID feces things considered foul odors, like smoke, rotten food, sour milk, etc. smells obviously recovered completely used be, issues smelling ""good"" smells, like candles, perfume, etc.

It's bizarre. never thought I'd point \*want\* smell bad odors unsettling can't smell all. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Last thing said we’ll probably need booster fall. back forth information helping comes vaccine hesitancy. Protecting kids dependent families taking individual action everyone locking point.

If kid 12-17 years old, get vaccinated ASAP.

If kid ages 2-11 isn’t eligible yet, yeah still precautions protect them, even vaccinated. Don’t submit herd mentality let guard unvaccinated kid.   long haulers study people asymptomatic determines longevity/how figure vaccine hasn’t around years? least long it’s safe use humans. Stay hydrated watch blood oxygen. headache probably dehydration, cured electrolytes (pedialyte cheap stuff) water. That’s antivaxxers never (really) paid attention vaccine industry. 

They don’t understand study limits overall nuance healthcare.

Not that, many Anderson’s collaborators Wuhan came Singapore end December gathering Nipah virus. word illness sweeping laboratory, said.

“There chatter,” Anderson said. “Scientists gossipy excited. nothing strange point view going point would make think something going here.”

The names scientists reported hospitalized haven’t disclosed. Chinese government Shi Zhengli, lab’s now-famous bat-virus researcher, repeatedly denied anyone facility contracted Covid-19. Anderson’s work facility, funding, ended pandemic emerged focused novel coronavirus. 

‘I’m Naive’
It’s it’s impossible virus spilled there. Anderson, better people, understands pathogen escape laboratory. SARS, earlier coronavirus emerged Asia 2002 killed 700 people, subsequently made way secure facilities handful times, said. 

If presented evidence accident spawned Covid-19, Anderson “could foresee things could maybe happen,” said. “I’m naive enough say absolutely write off.” 

And yet, still believes likely came natural source. Since took researchers almost decade pin nature SARS pathogen emerged, Anderson says she’s surprised haven’t found “smoking gun” bat responsible latest outbreak yet. 

The Wuhan Institute Virology large enough Anderson said didn’t know everyone working end 2019. aware published research lab involved testing viral components propensity infect human cells. Anderson convinced virus made intentionally infect people deliberately released—one disturbing theories emerged pandemic’s origins.

Gain Function
Anderson concede would theoretically possible scientist lab working gain function technique unknowingly infect unintentionally infect others community. there’s evidence occurred Anderson rated likelihood exceedingly slim.

Getting authorization create virus way typically requires many layers approval, scientific best practices put strict limits kind work. example, moratorium placed research could done 1918 Spanish Flu virus scientists isolated decades later.

Even gain function effort got clearance, it’s hard achieve, Anderson said. technique called reverse genetics.

“It’s exceedingly difficult actually make work want work,” said.

Anderson’s lab Singapore one first isolate SARS-CoV-2 Covid patient outside China grow virus. complicated challenging, even team used working coronaviruses knew biological characteristics, including protein receptor targets. key facets wouldn’t known anyone trying craft new virus, said. Even then, material researchers study—the virus’s basic building blocks genetic fingerprint—aren’t initially infectious, would need culture significant amounts infect people.

Despite this, Anderson think investigation needed nail virus’s origin all. She’s dumbfounded portrayal lab media outside China, toxic attacks scientists ensued.

One dozen experts appointed international taskforce November study origins virus, Anderson hasn’t sought public attention, especially since targeted U.S. extremists early 2020 exposed false information pandemic posted online. vitriol ensued prompted file police report. threats violence many coronavirus scientists experienced past 18 months made hesitant speak risk words misconstrued.

The elements known trigger infectious outbreaks—the mixing humans animals, especially wildlife—were present Wuhan, creating environment conducive spillover new zoonotic disease. respect, emergence Covid-19 follows familiar pattern. What’s shocking Anderson way unfurled global contagion.

“The pandemic something one could imagined scale,” said. Researchers must study Covid's calamitous path determine went wrong stop spread future pathogens pandemic potential.

An expert bat-borne viruses, Anderson foreign scientist undertaken research Wuhan Institute Virology’s BSL-4 lab, first mainland China equipped handle planet’s deadliest pathogens. recent stint ended November 2019, giving Anderson insider’s perspective place that’s become flashpoint search caused worst pandemic century.

The emergence coronavirus city institute scientists, clad head-to-toe protective gear, study exact family viruses stoked speculation might leaked lab, possibly via infected staffer contaminated object. China’s lack transparency since earliest days outbreak fueled suspicions, seized U.S. That’s turned quest uncover origins virus, critical preventing future pandemics, geopolitical minefield.

The work lab director emerging infectious diseases section—Shi Zhengli, long-time colleague Anderson’s dubbed ‘Batwoman’ work hunting viruses caves—is shrouded controversy. U.S. questioned lab’s safety alleged scientists engaged contentious gain function research manipulated viruses manner could made dangerous.

It’s stark contrast place Anderson described interview Bloomberg News, first she’s shared details working lab.

Half-truths distorted information obscured accurate accounting lab's functions activities, routine they’ve portrayed media, said.

“It’s boring, regular lab worked way high-containment lab,” Anderson said. “What people saying is.”

Now Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute Infection Immunity, Anderson began collaborating Wuhan researchers 2016, scientific director biosafety lab Singapore’s Duke-NUS Medical School. research—which focuses lethal viruses like Ebola Nipah cause disease bats perpetually circulate—complemented studies underway Chinese institute, offered funding encourage international collaboration.

A rising star virology community, Anderson, 42, says work Ebola Wuhan realization life-long career goal. favorite movie “Outbreak,” 1995 film disease experts respond dangerous new virus—a job Anderson said wanted do. her, meant working Ebola high-containment laboratory. 

Anderson’s career taken world. obtaining undergraduate degree Deakin University Geelong, Australia, worked lab technician Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Boston, returned Australia complete PhD supervision eminent virologists John Mackenzie Linfa Wang. post-doctoral work Montreal, moving Singapore working Wang, described Anderson “very committed dedicated,” similar personality Shi. 

“They’re blunt high moral standards,” Wang said phone Singapore, he’s director emerging infectious diseases program Duke-NUS Medical School. “I’m proud Danielle’s able do.”

On Ground
Anderson ground Wuhan experts believe virus, known SARS-CoV-2, beginning spread. Daily visits period late 2019 put close proximity many others working 65-year-old research center. part group gathered morning Chinese Academy Sciences catch bus shuttled institute 20 miles away.

As sole foreigner, Anderson stood out, said researchers looked her.

“We went dinners together, lunches, saw outside lab,” said.

From first visit formally opened 2018, Anderson impressed institute’s maximum biocontainment lab. concrete, bunker-style building highest biosafety designation, requires air, water waste filtered sterilized leaves facility. strict protocols requirements aimed containing pathogens studied, Anderson said, researchers underwent 45 hours training certified work independently lab.

The induction process required scientists demonstrate knowledge containment procedures competency wearing air-pressured suits. “It’s very, extensive,” Anderson said.

Entering exiting facility carefully choreographed endeavor, said. Departures made especially intricate requirement take chemical shower personal shower—the timings precisely planned.

Virologists infectious disease experts initially dismissed theory, noting viruses jump animals humans regularity. clear evidence within SARS-CoV-2’s genome artificially manipulated, lab harbored progenitor strains pandemic virus. Political observers suggested allegations strategic basis designed put pressure Beijing.

And yet, China’s actions raised questions. government refused allow international scientists Wuhan early 2020 outbreak mushrooming, including experts U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention, already region.

Beijing stonewalled allowing World Health Organization experts Wuhan year, provided limited access. team’s final report, written vetted Chinese researchers, played possibility lab leak. Instead, said virus probably spread via bat another animal, gave credence favored Chinese theory could transferred via frozen food.

Never Sick
China’s obfuscation led outside researchers reconsider stance. Last month, 18 scientists writing journal Science called investigation Covid-19’s origins would give balanced consideration possibility lab accident. Even director-general WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said lab theory hadn’t studied extensively enough.

But it’s U.S. President Joe Biden’s consideration idea—previously dismissed many Trumpist conspiracy theory—that given newfound legitimacy. Biden called America’s intelligence agencies last month redouble efforts rooting genesis Covid-19 earlier report, disclosed Wall Street Journal, claimed three researchers lab hospitalized flu-like symptoms November 2019.

What World Wants China Disclose Wuhan Lab Leak Probe

Anderson said one knew Wuhan institute ill toward end 2019. Moreover, procedure reporting symptoms correspond pathogens handled high-risk containment labs.

“If people sick, assume would sick—and wasn’t,” said. “I tested coronavirus Singapore vaccinated, never it.” Good drugs back menu boys Dense outbreaks people dense heads  Countries vaccines doubling backwards get countries like India vaccinated prevent development variant vaccines ineffective against. soon variant exists, whole world basically sent right back Jan 2020.  hyper-regionalized

Well, hopefully vaccines keep working. data UK Israel promising. (Because national healthcare collecting data - US CDC collecting significant data breakthrough infections anymore.) Isn’t fantastic? Look far we’ve come since March 2020.

Even ordered Pfizer we’d still probably waiting given exporting situation. lack of. NC big vaccination campaign. stadium parking lot used packed times went. drugs stores around state giving shots too. get shot want one. Indiana, we’re stretching. Thank much information. strict daughter(who diagnosed cancer 2 weeks old) who’s toddler finally feeling ok outdoor play (approved oncologist pediatrician) delta news freaked going strict lockdown her. reassuring currently can’t vaccinated. bugged mom months letting get vaccine. vaccinated wouldn’t let I’m 16 thinks it’ll make infertile. grandma ended taking I’ve got second shot week AZ restricted people 60. 

Everybody else getting Pfizer that's supply limited til atleast August. exact reasons.  Also, numbers indicate steady case rate, I'm betting good chance things take summer gatherings, schools starting, etc.. least area. yes, data shows... understand fuck vaccines scarier people covid. That's great read. Well done!

It's possible sharing stories like encourage vaccine-hesitant 1000's ""early adopters"" ever could, thank sharing this! one study showed fully vaccinated people chance get Delta variant well 20%.

Source please. Here's article long term symptoms 1918 Spanish flu case anyone's curious info: people get vaccinated, maybe people get vaccinated eventually catch it, get full partial immunity. point anywhere else spread to, it'll fizzle out.

I mean, unless there's variants coming Africa elsewhere. biggest gap see urban vs rural. Maybe figure see 5 people day issue them. What's over? Covid? No. far it. honestly think getting started. report comment lol

as said, check back 2-3 weeks see things going studies showing hospitalization rate Delta much higher (10x greater).

Source please. read different numbers time, also heard 19% long haulers asymptomatic acute infection. reports vaccine causing longhaul people, proven, anecdotal. Seems immune system subjected spike protein causes kind weird shit. Bret Weinstein good podcast Youtube took days, sure got see it. Every guy try pegged least once. frustrating, find word cheque day, asked paper sign money..


I've found loading vitamin b complex helps particularly bad. That’s I’m basically saying. never going people won’t get vaccinated. trust anything Russia says. AFAIK really disclosed data claim proves vaccine's efficiency.

Russia, terms trust, level North Korea, slightly China. hope brings much needed light issues people suffer chronic illnesses face.

I think lot people would actually experience understand horrible is. upset person internet who's spent year half trying empathetic exhausted, upset communities people refuse get vaccinated, wear masks, practice social distancing?  I've never heard something like Today, small town Georgia Lowes, saw 1 person mask. Everyone else must vaccinated! component vaccine would people allergic to, exactly?

How many people anaphylaxis reaction vaccine?

This sounds like problem 11 cases per *million* doses. statistically insignificant point really worth discussing issue. real question someone protected natural immunity got Covid back November.

People still show antibodies tests, protection. He’s talking every week since February last year. He’s kept clear head voice reason thus far. He’s pretty spot understanding headed. see 2nd infection would kill already partial immunity. Tres commas club Actually, no, it’s matter time variant comes make current vaccine ineffective. possible? Yes. likely? No. virus would mutate significant way order completely evade efficacy. change potentially lower efficacy, doubtful become ineffective. said, it’s always good prepared worst case scenario. Awwww lucky you! Hope fun hahaha congrats! Yeah girlfriend lives Germany obviously seen long time. Politicians need stop playing games. opening borders tourism. Sadly work time take two weeks go Mexico seeing me. much better now, doctor figured lumbar pain deep seeded singles, shingles manifesting.
She 24.  forgetting words called aphasia. typically due form brain damage. MS get aphasia time. called tomato ""red citrus ball"" once. know citrus got yeah. frustrating. really hoping breakthrough infections lead long term covid. Fuck Thank you, paywall pisses every time lol connected.

Hopefully vaccine available his/her age group summer over. ok. They've practising 54 years moment!   got upvote using whole nother! That’s colloquial kinda feel could guess you’re either author might read.   Wait see racial breakdown vaccines Mississippi realize instead dunking dumb rednecks they’re actually making light racial inequality.  area. Low vaccination rates, majority willingly unmasked last May (2020) onwards. “Pro Life” bumper stickers abound. fail see getting vaccinated public health human kind isn’t “pro life”. want ways- aren’t pro choice traditional sense definitely want choice whether vaccinate mask. putting life hands vaccine? hope you’re joking. shoot epinephrine go allergic shock fine. sit 15 minutes.  Krogers even takes license can't leave. really unlikely reaction. Good time delta hits hard fall. Thanks info. There’s lovely comment lower thread explains shouldn’t count immunity sickness since five variants now. becomes endemic though it’ll much less deadly like flu. Meaning boosters necessary high risk like flu. confused. Wasn’t supposed happen variant not? Outbreaks among dense. Good thing school opens back person lecture.  Yeah ""honor system"" obviously working. would've thought 🤯 Don’t forget! could also eventually mutate wipe us means another year able get kind healthcare non emergency issues rural areas. got vaccinated wear masks daily. go kick rocks care. Ok thanks explanation. Note initial infections original strain COvId infections P1 strain. far know haven’t gotten really nailed delta variants think nature virus makes mutations extraordinarily rare.

The reason we've hundreds millions people infected.

If virus replicating often (because high immunity levels), even less opportunities new mutations. They're actually reported lot. see fairly commonly. I've looking factual science-based covid reporting since pandemic began, sure algorithms serving content gotten message. people need see see it, algorithms going challenge echo chambers.  get aphasia sometimes migraines. get creative words brain decides angry meat ball bone house. vaccines needs approved immediately. can't afford vaccinate kids.  somehow even half still won’t even get damn vaccine. They’ll spend day treating people it, watching patients die able damn thing, still refuse get vaccinated. It’s fucking mind boggling.  already know ain’t serious it’s blocked paywall. really know long immunity last different variants, we? 2nd infection also act booster.. Thanks saying this. work retail go back masks. covid outbreaks working store. employees lived hospital workers sick family members went wedding. 

Let unvaccinated put masks back on. supposed wearing anyway, one checks records. Could also change variants line? October last year. Lumbar pain first symptom. cousin (who schoolteacher) twice. second time partially vaccinated, wasn’t bad. I’ve read they’re working cancer vaccines too. Sounds like good come bad times. isn’t nice go terms? See comments. get tested, tests 3 months later antibodies lung scaring. United States already make people pay things, clearly already know that. clear vaccines widely available would treat COVID differently.

It's healthcare system want. neither system kid cancer paying out-of-pocket antivaxxers get free ride, now.  read this? Lol. I’m loner depression makes seek friends.  high risk death? Yes also general poor health/ comorbidities lack oxygen Wrong. delta way dangerous kids flu. Confirmed positive Feb 2020? Hard get tested back then… Top comment I’m dreading fall. 😬 variant. Herd immunity covid achievable vaccination.  chills 2nd shot expected, people know side effects all. fine   way go! keep mask keep smart you’ll fine. make sure follow second. Sucks mom vaccines left family....hurts inside bit get Future vaccines won’t choosy strains target, however part flu vaccines aren’t effective short period infection high viral load. immune system less time sterilize infection COVID.  Right, aware that. specifically calling 10x hospitalization statement knowledge claimed demonstrated anywhere follow shit way closely (as many us here). 

Lately I’ve noticing tons unsourced, upvoted claims here, like 10x one above, making numbers help. lose arm, dead. deaths. understand?

If spend week hospital incur large bills stressing family, dead.

If kids start dying, new strain fact ""just Covid"" statistics studied many months ago, guess dead time. 

Or stick head sand pretend none exists, makes uncomfortable match world view.  ""impending doom"" two months ago? It’s hard know since data hasn’t released. Everyone acting like exist Cuba actually great medical field. lot people go Cuba study medicine. girl knew studied UC Davis went Cuba medical school, done came back US residency here. doctor now. University Americas Havana. buddy study abroad UCLA. Cuba trains lot doctors sends South America humanitarian missions. leaks coming travel banned? Protection? Yes. lot? No. People stop optimistic vaccination. also get vaccinated &amp; social distancing (this utmost important) anything better nothing. leaks coming travel banned? safe get blood work done 10 hours vaccination? want sure Hello. guys liberty choose preferred vaccine? think countries governments opted disclose brand names encourage people get whatevwr available. Thanks.  district required, doubt would able to. vaccinated rest teachers grade level lol  COVID's mutation rate appears astronomically low. Pretty sure fizzle die hit greater immunity levels. go AZ. big backers University Queensland vaccine also would Australian vaccine manufactured Australia. Unfortunately effective vaccine threw lot HIV false positives therefore still got TGA approval. 

Not saying looked vaccines earlier never AZ spent lot backing Australian research. Sure that’s going convince anything differently. don’t think they’re going end hospital. hopefully mutate evade current immunity  probably used first 3 examples, since actually reduce healthcare costs, technically. 

But get saying, think that's totally reasonable.  Ok Stephen bother reading wrote? literally started vaccines good. let clarify appear easily confused.

everyone get vaccinated. according epidemiologists WHO, people considered Dr. Fauci's peers. recommend also wearing mask. I.e. both.

&amp;#x200B;

Now unless work cdc WHO. Let save time. work one places. care opinion is. take pandemic advice random fucking reddit commenter. one got gross side effects first AZ dose Pfizer dose. Still worth though! Ugh, too, buddy people sub always saying doesn’t effect kids. Yes except immunization lasting variant. Costa Rica Puerto Rico.

Also, stating all. point world health rankings place Costa Rica US 36th place. libertairian\_hiker stated experience Costa Rica poor, rankings meaningful them. People shit healthcare US number valid reasons, see anyone flocking Costa Rica Cuba care around here. still world class care research taking place here, regardless rankings state. ignore implications mass liquidation, cumulative theoretical wealth american billionaires would cover 1 year current annual healthcare costs. billionaires money could get 1 year Jealous! received got third arm. Shirts nuisance. odds getting surfaces practically zero. But, mean, that's easily mitigated use hand sanitizer even source transmission. probably frequency negative stories get exposure. Fist bump They'll catch virus then, become part herd immunity statistics. Damages lungs second time finishes off

Edit autocorrect You’re wrong lol. Remind 6 months laugh Hopefully mRNA flu vaccine?

My mom can’t get flu vaccine due egg allergy. sake, I’d love see mRNA flu vaccines sooner rather later she’s got medical issues make higher risk. She’s got problem mRNA, got Pfizer months ago. live outside Charlotte too. seen “I self-identify vaccinated” shirts yet? Imagine thinking somehow worrying stranger's opinions. must worry things lot project readily. Four *possible reasons:* 

1. UK ant colony
2. Infections appear densely populated areas ethnic minorities large numbers vaxx-hesitant
3. predominant vaccine AZ inferior mRNA products offered Pfizer Moderna
4. Despite restrictions, many UK given thrown towel. helped 1 2 wear mask distance like everyone still got children fellow citizens cannot take it. like normal covid infection can't tell why. two 70-80 year old ytd fully vaccinated asymptomatic. also 20-60 year old also fully vaccinated usual mild symptoms like fever, runny nose, sore throat cough. 

But thankfully none severe symptoms. covid last year, basically bad cold. long you’re ‘older’ immunocompromised. You’d fine, probably fine ! Tell people died second wave Spanish Flu. formula work immunized silent carriers. point thing herd immunity. Oh yes booked flight September....unfortunately job can't take time summer.....so yeah hahaha It’s single payer, government run healthcare. it’s multilayer private health insurance subsidized government. zero sympathy people unwilling vaccinate even wear masks appalling irresponsible behavior harms others responsible possible unable vaccinate read article months ago saying going endemic lot places. cant help notice gerd mention. covid give you/make existing gerd worse? Ive acid issues swear went overdrive post covid. Nope, I'm covid researcher. OP, explaining scientific hypothesis works case. 

Here's news article detailing situation though. better solution mandate vaccines. Require vaccine passports enter DMV, courthouses, public transit, etc. Nowhere article Fauci quoted saying unvaccinated people greater risk winter.

Nowhere article even quoted saying Delta greatest threat unvaccinated people, claiming did. 2 year old got in, too! far guys? side effects? Mine's getting second Moderna couple weeks. bad reactions far, hope handles second one better did. Yes, even vaccinated people spread infection.

I hope vax kids soon. *know* there's headline writer somewhere itching use ""Variant X"" article. Yes Delta going fuck shit reading. Fun fact, many bedside RN moved last wave - know wife RN. monumental nightmare gets like seen areas. exactly fucking wrong. Jesus. Follow science. Masks aren’t solution problem, vaccination is.

Masks stopgap vaccines unavailable.   hysteria, Dr. Fauci earlier week saying delta variant ""greatest threat"" unvaccinated people: also read paper stating that, mentioning that, reminded part, too: Nope, interests massive insurance / health / pharma companies ability pour unlimited money politics.

But absolutely agree functions support American work force's collective Stockholm syndrome. anyone think children???

Seriously, kids get sick?????? buddy’s otherwise healthy uncle Uruguay, currently ICU, would beg differ. got Sinovac along bunch people community good amount symptomatic. Like said, vaccines may good vacuum get continue living life like you’re vaccinated. argument ""see, gonna mutate anyway. vaccines effective."" Masks homeopathy compared vaccines. Look basically every country that’s vaccinated adult population. masks that? No. Vaccines did.

Masks stopgap allow vaccines developed distributed. mean fuckall vaccinated people.  cases increasing Israel 12-15 age group, lower vaccination rate get sooner. Maybe people could less selfish wear mask helps people able get vaccine yet. Plus, getting Covid seems like much better incentive wear mask. FL did. Unfortunately. least district did. changed “highly recommended.” 26% yikes... Get ready spikes horrible can't get vaxxed, whatever reason Still convinced, need 5 billion doses given make sure safe.... /s ""and I’m sure never either, Covid started."" &lt;-- part Covid risk young kids low. societal danger much higher school closings. Saline water? like counted. many non-covid deaths marked Covid Yes.

Any variant Covid going danger unvaccinated. knew resident low vax rate area, long hauler, owner body autoimmune disorder, pretty fucking bummed.  **Jun. 27, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Vaccine rollout great here, put perspective apart overseas travel odd 4-5 day lockdown, parts Australia everything normal living pandemic. Whereas UK family really starting get back socialising seeing other, almost year lockdown, missed school months spent stuck houses seeing nobody.

The economy booming too, little job loss, lengthy restrictions killing economy. lot less long term damage increased poverty debt.

In ways think Europe approach worse worlds, particularly UK, still lots deaths, lots economic damage lots restrictions. Think super yachts, would ya? I’m small business owner prepared take hard line fortunately employees got vaccinated. stricter restrictions overall compared US. deaths compare UK/Italy US? mRNA vaccines different traditional vaccines actually ""inert virus."" mRNA code instructs body create small part COVID-19, spike protein, body creates immune response to.

Oh well. long hauler congestion issues went away vaccinated. question - new information indicates fully vaccinated people start wearing masks part ""more cautious stance""?


The answer World Health Organization changed masking recommendation. Even US different place lot world, OP still following basic health advice WHO. information OP operating difficulty finding fault logic even I’m starting go maskless public myself.  *so* glad able get 10 month old trial (no placebo), especially live Louisiana.

It may accelerate vaccinated months end, that’s enough push one wave, it’s something. Oh great tell people nothing lose going die decision made spite.. could possibly go wrong. elderly make vast majority covid deaths, especially congregate care settings. still going majority deaths, even vaccinated, risk old efficacy virus. uk vaccinated deaths unvaccinated, young unvaccinated, old overwhelmingly vaccinated.

It's easy say exceedingly unlikely issue, depends definition risk. likely die old vaccinated person young unvaccinated person. like personal risk covid, motivated get vaccinated, stressed out. actual risk miniscule compared vaccinated elderly person location zero mitigation. problem exceedingly likely exposure south, especially congregate care, going way protected mitigation. Far fewer get sick, still hundreds elderly people vaccinated die. right thing, vaccinations really meant personal prophylactic, they're meant societal cure.

Also, communities brook impact personal freedom, much easier institution elderly care impose limits care. elderly people, risk, stressed make sacrifice, generations betraying duty care.

I'd say sucks.  wrong. Brazil places 30% population infected once. Whatever immunity get likely long lasting. may also apply vaccines (hence experts always talking boosters).

Delta variant also happy transmit children.  unvaccinated taxed higher rate vaccinated? Countries free health care often tax behaviours lead higher risk. Cigarettes taxed heavily, studies shown smoking results much higher health costs government.

If government paying covid treatments, would make sense willfully unvaccinated would receive higher tax rate help pay cost, infection, increased spread. Agree Yes. current vaccine works agaonst current variants. wont true forever covid stay like flu. become endemic reqiore boosters. almost certainty. frequency boosters entirely debate far though.

That's be. idea. rarely go there. fundies white supremacists make uncomfortable. friend got infected November, got infected would lockdown months, maybe year, also closed borders. quarantine perfect mean work all. let’s talk women experiencing weird menstrual cycles vaccine. Everyone shrugs, MEN something change like (say red semen vaccination) world would stop. war, politics, nada. They’d shut got figured out. hypocrisy. excellent, hope people take approach literally never sicker day second shot. Imagine much worse ACTUAL COVID would have. I’ve known lived several people got COVID even mild cases absolutely miserable go WAY worse post vaccine symptoms. It’s free, 2 hrs time 24 hours misery avoid otherwise likely worse two weeks life possible permanent chronic pain. totally worth it.  I'm good giving people tax refund take shot. Whatever convinces people get them. Ive thought theyre still dumb selfish. One hope unvaccinated start dropping lile flies. venn diagram people protest people anti vax likely circle. People like drive Missouri get fireworks neck woods. think may pick fireworks year. Likely people dense…… Also worth mentioning, lockdowns go one (Sydney) probably ""light"" side. retail stores open; cafes/restaurants take-away delivery only, still work; schools would probably least partially open school holidays happening; construction workers still work; people allowed outside; etc. don’t think you’re quite getting I’m saying. Citation needed spent 90 minutes ER $16,000. can’t imagine much experience cost. I'm thinking thing. find resources safety/efficacy J&amp;J + 1 Pfizer, J&amp;J + 2 Pfizer shots? didn’t say immunity same. said level protection severe disease hospitalization damn near same. People gotten covid getting severe disease even get infected. shows robust level immunity would healthcare workers testing positive? wearing sufficient PPE, correct? scenario, people taking care infected children home. Living them, without masks (my assumption), 24 hours day. measure PCR positive swabs surfaces fine. would positive swab nasal passage unmasked family member surprising? got already. Doctor told expect side effects. Didn’t side effects.

I could choose second AZ Jab biontech got AZ/ BT combination. end doesn’t matter spike protein delivered. Sick people US already go bankrupt. It’s actually fucked up. horrible society. Haha remember “double deadly” wherever hell month ago?  hit antivaxxers I’d letting nature take it’s course. We’re hoping buy home next years prices would much nicer variant swept area. Unfortunately, long it’s also risk kids immune compromised folks, we’re best limiting spread. 

Also, since it’s shown vaccine isn’t 100% effective, I’d rather limit number times I’m rolling particular die. didn’t spend last year staying masking get now. 

Then there’s medical staff worst year life really don’t need repeat. 

Unfortunate, since world would much kinder, better place good portion antimaskers … weren’t anymore. Unless coworker doctor, taking medical advice them. PCR routinely used measure infection individuals post-Covid. PCR would pick random virus breathed in, mechanism work.

Quantitatively PCR measured Cycle (doubling) threshold many individuals clocking 30 Ct many tests limited 40 Ct. difference factor 1,000; think that's quite sensitive enough reliably get breath breathed in, yet replicated. Yes, imagine insane hypothetical US government doesn’t help sick people. Australia pretty much every state constantly tests sewage Covid fragments, know pretty quickly something amiss shows target area tests positive, generally it’s cities hotel quarantine happening ping family member someone cannot get vaccinated, thank much getting shot.

You means it'll safer uncle there. Thank Internet Friend. Please get vaccinated people!!!!  Outdoors vaccinated enough. Outdoors practically enough Whoa, headaches? too, thought work. happened around time gotten covid too.

Fuck me. Yep, super easy! filled little bit paperwork, got shot done! ""Certain parts U.S."" aka South. 
Gee, wonder why? May non issue terms relative numbers non issue mind people. need somehow address that. 86% first dose 62% second dose 
 
UK 65% first dose, 48% second dose. Second dose risen recently, critical particular Delta variant. Ya I’ll definitely keep masked up. still avoid going anywhere really. shopping every weeks that’s it. I’m kind hermit point. This! learn effects menstruation even evaluated clinical trials vaccine! mean, nearly 50% participants might menstruating (assuming percentage menopausal) didn’t even think include questions trials? Instead, find many problems undergo lots tests painful biopsies, could avoided. Indeed. one age 12 vaccinated yet. I'm vaccinated still mask protect young'en. vaccinated people still catch it. Don’t make conclusions based sample size 30 Especially country protection pretty much gone variant picking speed.

And think worldwide years still really control.

Another months home I'll fully vaccinated, finally. hundreds million India received vaccine yet adverse effects few

similar observation Indonesia. long term affects severe covid infection include damaged lungs. Even second bout affected ability breathe would mean hospitalization potentially death. rAcE similar experiences sub. it’s totally unreasonable uneasy covid/new variants… don’t understand anger/pushback. It’s perplexing. 🤷‍♀️ Thanks reply. Interesting, perhaps immunity lessened second time, t-cells b-cells etc. Either way, one wants dealing twice. Glad better. World Health Organization's advice targeted toward world, 25% population first dose mostly oldest most-exposed. live US, follow CDC advice. Europe... what's story vaccines Delta variant? existing vaccines provide protection new variant? It’s normal, aphasia can’t form sentences traumatic head injuries strokes, friend brain fog.  Ya see heart inflammation cases hospitalization rate 5% (it strongly age dependent, reasonable best estimate), 0.2% now. mortality rate around 1/10th that, probably around 0.02% vaccinated 

Citation please? Mortality rate vaccinated individuals far lower that. article: Charisse fears shot could effect daughter’s reproductive system (a misperception public health officials repeatedly refuted).

“Isabella said, ‘It’s body.’ said, ‘Well, it’s body you’re 18.’”

Daughter's. Reproductive. System. queen even annoyed? sure quarantines needed fully vaccinated. 6 vaccinated get infected exactly supposed transmit virus someone else? this!!! people's biases non-global north countries 'trustworthy' really apparent unbelievable vaccine patent protections still lifted. Politicians really priorities straight. I’d stop going chances people don’t vaccine stay inside !!!! one point, dumping bodies rivers without burning them. sorry, request another trial pfizer, moderna, astrazeneca 'impartial'? cuba legitimately good healthcare system; know falls outside hegemony needs held exceptional standards given global north. help kids whose parents let get vaccinated I’m getting vaccine FDA approved last time put “ medicine” body wasn’t FDA approved doctor called moron.  Hotel Quarantine protecting community large, people quarantine. Kinda. They're biotech R&amp;D is, poor country, impressive. train shitload doctors, doctors decent. great, decent. try extremely hard provide best medical care due lack money, that's often good. shortages imported medicines, equipment supplies. public health monitoring preventative care extremely good. mean things like control STDs, family planning, maternal wellness, etc. They're smart enough know (unlike US...) really aggressively push preventative medicine, pays hugely line lower health care costs. Esp. since preventative medicine WAY cheaper implement poor country system treats presentable illnesses.

I want get sick Cuba, choice third world countries get sick in, would Cuba. WHO's advice completely point. 25% population first dose, they're mostly vulnerable often-exposed groups. know vaccinated people spread virus unvaccinated people (extremely often fact delta common vaccines). everyone particular area get vaccinated (this case two countries, ignore kids) vaccinated people need keep wearing masks.

If local health agency different advice relevant you, go tit. Can’t say hair cuts but, I’m immino-compromised person dentist several times. dentist seems seriously proactive Covid protocols. get don’t feel like comfortable always leave. Keep mind communities atrociously low vaccination rates. People vaccinate (or able get vaccinated yet) tend live near other. areas gonna get hit hard, eventually Nurses ALWAYS make sure there’s air injecting. usually hold syringe light inject tiniest bit make sure doesn’t air it. Hope makes sense Judging amount maskless people inside visited area, yall pretty good vaccination rates too.

It January. Yeah it'll that. “Vaccine dead”. Wtf. think everyone isn’t vaccinated dies? That's actually site saw earlier today. linked it. Thank so.

A lot people politicize Covid beginning end US actually done really well. developed one three vaccines amazingly short period time. rollout perfect (How could anything large complex perfect?) actually gone rather well. vaccines free charge anyone wants plus we're giving millions dozes away countries. think look back last summer say hoped would time year.  thought sarcastic first comment. “Tell X” tongue check counter point, actually “go find people tell them”. Might language barrier.   People Manaus Brazil likely infected 2x different strains. 2nd strain killed plenty people survived first. One quite strong piece evidence favour Sputnik V [San population got Sputnik led dramatic fall infections short period time nearly zero, indicating high efficacy. unexpected serious side effects reported. Also new cases even Delta variant starting take across Europe good sign far. 

Of course, sample size small Sputnik problems upkeeping quality standards, overall seems good viral vector vaccines (AstraZeneca Janssen), better. Honestly surprising vaccine uptake low Russia, even considering distrust government, mixed messaging social media misinformation. personal opinion would Novavax:

* high efficacy.
* one protein subunit.
* potentially - countries may able produce without much uplift existing infra.
* comparible example existing vaccine HPV vaccine.
* require specialised freezer.
* may potential issue adenovirus-based vaccine has: blood-clotting.
* people may bit comfortable somewhat ""more traditional"" approach vaccine.

Don't get wrong: personally issues mrna-based vaccines (having taken one myself). significant lumbar disc herniation required surgery (microdiscectomy) 9 months covid. 
I 100% blame covid. I'll interested hear common side effect years now. Vaccinated people live virus fine. unvaccinated risk, delta vaccinated people able spread covid unvaccinated sometimes raises risk. pretty asinine kids vaccinated, risk relatively low. even current vaccines, egg allergy thought shifted quite history egg allergy severity receive licensed, recommended, age-appropriate influenza vaccine. history severe allergic reaction egg (i.e., symptom hives) vaccinated inpatient outpatient medical setting (including necessarily limited hospitals, clinics, health departments, physician offices), supervision health care provider able recognize manage severe allergic conditions.

It's there's 0 danger, likely get flu vaccine that's already there. super nervous look getting done allergist's office. friend dryer trying let know put clean clothes blanket. actually said was...

""I put clothes your... bed... towel...""

We laughed pretty fucking hard one. He's tested low B vitamins takes supplements suggested doctor. worried cause kind thing lot.

Honestly time time well. got me. completely forgot event took place 100 years ago people happen be...wait it...dead today 2021. Sharp analysis! smug said that? 🤔

I mean agree sentiment still... 🤔🤔 Missouri local vaccination percent 23%. people gotten vaccine probably all. We've already open back covid wards hospitals. bury vague comment ""these measures relaxed regions"" means they're really trying speak CDC local US affairs. 

Not makes messaging much less muddy Completely normal. still better quarantine leaks, restrictions entry. ""Tell X"" figure speech. mean actually tell people Melburnian here. wish 5 day lockdowns. stupid . girlfriend get corona twice mom sister daughter meanwhile whole time never wore mask never got corona somehow antibodys protect me. Doesnt make sense. thing think vaccine made nano control time given . hate sounding crazy nothing makes sense . Michael Scarn!  grew huge amounts lead anything well. So, double whammy Well there's problem. Expecting good in-depth reporting news outlets show people really going on. well ratings guess. one sentencing death penalty? you? Me? sentencing themselves. worse that. rest world clamoring vaccine vocal group lets shots go waste freezers. shots get life back normal, prevent long term covid, even prevent significant number deaths. refuse. live (hopefully) consequences actions.

The flip side connected. inaction impact others. So, many people harmed selfish few? slow assuming outside help comes. Which, considering people Africa slowly vaccinated going case perfect enemy good.
Nothing world perfectly safe outside cage. Fear cage build ourselves. source many. 

Yes true. know trying spread fear covid's risk children, science absolutely shows children extremely low risk covid, similar levels risk (or even below) flu. *good thing*. lot people seem reluctant accept good news scientific results all. delta, vaccinated people sometimes transmit virus unvaccinated people. risk vaccinated people still extremely low (comparable less boss's kid flu). FYI - That's always way is. Old people around much longer always like stay around &amp; fuck things much depart.  countries UK eu. shots? Everybody comments practically begging boosters smh never even GERD COVID honestly. COVID felt like heart fire I’d get dull aches chest. thought nearing heart attack. thought precordial cache syndrome. got put PPIs helped. Shhhh.... one supposed talk potential point origin. 

That leads inconvenient questions. shame seem stopped updating it, pandemic far world. Yeah, hand, scientists saying vaccine breakthrough ratios natural infection. Natural immunity may best all. (everyone get vaccine regardless, makes natural immunity better) That’s natural selection baby CANNOT RELAX, CITIZEN. 

~~Al Qaeda~~ ~~Isis~~ ~~COVID~~ Newest Variant could strike moment. Unless hate country, *stay vigilant*! also says around 90% Indonesian doctors vaccinated Sinovac. put protection rate death 93%.

It's ideal, doom title shows. find discussion pretty much google search direct links Primary source: UK also similar situation - Delta variant pretty good dodging natural immunity past variants

ie UK close 80% population COVID antibodies (from vaccines prior infections) despite Delta variant still surging.

We thankfully still finding deaths hospitalisations remain low, likely high levels antibodies population. Thoughts Delta result lockdowns health system overwhelm like last year US?  UK, people vaccinated, still lot get ill. Read Vaccine FAQ sub. address fears you’re having. Oh yes, I've heard. Housing prices monstrous Europe. 

House prices Asian countries horrendous well. Look China (esp Hong Kong), Taiwan South Korea. Americas pretty messed too.

As said, buckle up! talked someone yesterday said threw away bunch expired doses one took Issue was, choice. Scott Morrison offered 40 million doses Pfizer turned down, instead placing eggs AZ 100% avoidable. also enough AZ vaccines get decent chunk vaccinated nobody 50 allowed take it, vaccine uptake 50+ lower one would like. 1.1B almost 80% Indian population. Surely lethal? Yep US response worthy criticism due poorly government responded pandemic many ways planned decades advance.

A really interesting aspect many large companies US (particularly tech sector) seemingly much better understanding happening February/March US government - switching everyone remote work well ahead state federal government.

Testing disaster start, one accurate intelligence bad things were. Federal State response often contradictory, local healthcare systems multiple times came close collapse - *and kept happening throughout 15 months!*

Most damaging - something many similar countries managed avoid - deep politicisation crisis. led states zealous locking long periods time, states flippant removing restrictions first opportunity.

Where US really outshone rest world pharma capacity produce many vaccine doses short amount time - something developed country able do. Virtually anyone US could get vaccine dose within first 4-5 months 2020. Shocker estimates least half church vaccinated. state reaches 70 percent, could mean hundreds unvaccinated, unmasked people attending Sunday service.

Not sound callous, get ass church Sundays, get vaccinated. like back early spring people get appointments drive hour away find place. adult wants get vaccinated ~~can get vaccinated day~~ already vaccinated now. UK prioritised bringing deaths else, meant getting higher risk groups vaccinated first. contrast countries opened vaccination age groups earlier on. So, example, states US vaccinating adults since May became true whole UK last week.

This means something like 99% everyone likely die COVID two injections, great explains low deaths, 30s vaccinations ones one, virus spreading. framing. Chinese vaccines good enough protect severe forms death. ""journalists"" rather thankful 10 11 vaccines job, maybe rather complain lack patent waiver. better since 10x population underpaid interns taught use every tick book get views. Bologna American here. always assumed Canada Australia smaller, functional siblings ours.

Nice see entire English sibling tree screw (instead us).

That said, U.S. pretty good buying bunch crap nobody afford rushing houses. rollout surprise. worry first foremost, something people telling to. Talk doctor weigh risk vs benefits.

Old news. really stupid angle make political. conservatives done liberals great favor criticizing realistic conservative estimates. made exceeding conservative benchmark decisive victory. semi-famous actor (broadway actor maybe?) multiple amputations. ended dying anyways, yes something happens.  took son hospital months ago said covid test mandatory recieve treatment. 

Some still refuse treatment, suffer enough want treatment requires tested. nothing else, safety medical staff know get tested quarantine. based already open sourced research? Plus trusting Cuban government like trusting fox take care chickens 3 friends double vaccinated caught Delta. UK. 2 vaccinated Pfizer 1 AZ. cases symptoms runny nose headache (1 said assumed Hayfever tested positive Covid), heavy cold extent one said pre-Covid would day working home gone back office similar-feeling illness. Kids can’t get vaccinated, groups either can’t get vaccinated vaccine ineffective. problem people get vaccinated choose also go without masking. Brazil history successful mass vaccination campaigns even remote areas. healthcare system far-reaching and, expected handle vaccination drive well. That's Pfizer wanted use pilot program COVID vaccine.

The current federal government sabotaged vaccination efforts every level. got first Az, got 2nd pfizer, grab 3rd moderna complete set? Yes maybe slightly less effectiveness. Also worry one dose two much lower effectiveness world racing get everyone get doses. Small, properly staffed equipped hospitals, hospitals. talking India I'll join getting downvoted. Lots people addicted pandemic, like lots people need chaos enemies lives. world accept CoVid hits flu level deaths. No. getting close flu level deaths. change variant overcomes effectiveness vaccines fully would race get 3rd shot boosters. fear children. toddler fear getting dealing severe outcomes. variant scares most. Roll tide lmao do. infections rising steadily almost 2 months now. deaths haven’t. unvaccinated maskless people smart. know don’t need wear masks get vaccinated cause everyone else following guidelines! /s Thanks long people keep getting vaccinated… Centuries humanity survived multiple pandemics.

 


Like 1918 humanity wore masks tons deaths similar rules.

 


Yet many idiots fighting masks probably even thanks easier communication. appears last least year suspected last longer infections, even asymptomatic. 5% population vaccinated, even though 6 happened catch COVID, fairly common vaccinated people transmit COVID unvaccinated. would make sense whatsoever Australia fuck around lowest immunity rate world. Even USA, mean, Australia ? Another idiot friend posted gram vaccine isn’t safe-but he’s cool cell phones laptop WiFi balls, driving buzzed, speeding etc point, people encouraged every way possible get vaccinated, free donut, free beer fucking $50k lottery so. life isn’t worth compensation. let go now. I’m tired people. told pandemic over?  would seem not. lag couple weeks behind infections. started increase, It’s early say anything right now.  won’t available kids 2 time soon, kids young aren’t even able wear masks.  single infection /. time virus survives goes generations ( itself) there's chance mutates.

Usually virus bacteria go tons generations fast. It’s incredibly frustrating someone child 2yo cannot get vaccinated cannot wear mask. Delta variants seem better infecting young people lead worse outcomes. Vaccines widely available US months now, yet still tons people choose get go around mask free think COVID “over” won’t affect them. Fuck people. Pharmacies vaccination sites US often one vaccine available, tell one upfront, preference choose pharmacy based that. Well…it kinda isn’t it? indicates, zero covid transmission policy bit fools dream. virus always going find way spread. literally need kill entire population achieve perfect 0. even put sickness, drastically different. hear respiratory illness people get, gastrointestinal versions largely go unreported. F L R realized. That’s bad. sad isn’t risk happening extremely low? Like mean extremely low! think C MIS-C means children. think mis multi inflammatory syndrome something... case misC always kids case numbers really matter hospitalisation especially deaths low? important, anyone able access it. Yes, maybe no. Wrong. See: cases COVID-19 kids, \~0.03% dying = 1200 children died COVID-19

An average flu year kills 37-199 kids according CDC: statistically COVID-19 3x deadly children year flu. wear mask outside? appreciate it! side effects? Moderna side effects quite harsh.

I'm going work look issues green screen people get fully vaccinated PCR-tested shortly beforehand. Since new project use signals (potential) errors. Sure, going zero covid strategy like Australia literally want zero transmissions 90% reduced transmissions.  Well sounds like stop interstate travel set! 1st No, you’re dealing ‘I’m pretending stupid’ situation here. I’m it. Forgot even wrote hour ago. Yeah, fuck old people.  Pharmacist California. point amongst highest vaccinated states county. run clinic literally cannot fill slots. vaccines ultra effective vs variant. 

At point unvaccinated every opportunity get vaccinated. Vaccines prevent 100% deaths. Chilean government made comparison Sinovac Pfizer. similar effectiveness preventing deaths far 100%. Maybe know going around someone unvaccinated vaccinated hanging vaccinated people generally good reason keep wearing mask. Asymptomatic spread vaccinated people essentially unheard of. continue act flu, since that's deadlier kids. Reading thread, holy hell feel bad nurses, again. Canadian don’t get this. pay this? long pay back? people afford don’t insurance? chinese vaccine shouldnt counted Yep, swept neighborhood couple weeks ago. vaccinated house didn’t know. Pfizer apparently offered us priority start rollout phase wanted use us case study/example rejected cost unique story, guy spent money organize fake vaccination camps people publicity. seems suffering mental disorder know one confirm knew vaccines fake even duped someone money. Oh fuck, ability remember words declining pretty hard lately. brain tumor? He's board Pfizer vested interest outspoken guess may genetical issue Aus? lost sense smell taste several times colds, days nose clogged. corona, loss lasted couple weeks even nose clogged. Same, I've seen Gottlieb thrice week made double take main issue stems fact agreements companies work. 

The Indian version(SII one) complete licensing deal SII control production, sale, marketing etc.

The country companies(SK, MX, BZ etc) producing AstraZeneca, AZ responsible ensuring meet EU standards vaccines used EU.

SII apply get EMA approval(even submit dat AZ need apply diff license.) seeing plan sell EU hard see this. Whilst true, go show vaccines positive effect. nonsense. pandemic sense 99% deaths preventable remaining 1% dwarfed e.g. traffic fatalities

If ""pandemic over"" mean covid ceases exist, never ever happen. mean ""people willing get vaccinated need worry"" moment already come. Yes, variants concerning, worried covid variants diseases ignoring years. economical better Dec aus vac numbers high. issue Europe. Outside Europe, one gives damn non issue Go get shot, solved mine. Yep aus great contact tracing. Testing. population compliant. people get back 100 %. people don't, however.   27 percent one jab Started random back ache (maybe coincidence), pretty rough sore throat 2 days, congestion persisted, mild fever night twice. None really bad. Weirdest thing feel it. Like slightly disconnected reality. makes sense. mention parents let teens get vaccine.   anything, rated efficacy Sinovac.

WHich 100%. Like vaccines either.

Thats HATED publicity spin ""100% protection death"" claimed AZ trial. 

If like 15 people vaccine group get none dies special property vaccinated, statistically expected.

They would needed least factor 20 statistics give even 2 sigma estimate wheter fatality rate deviation compared infection rate non vaccinated infected. much lower risk long covid well. authorities Abu Dhabi, UAE going deploy special scanner detect whether person covid not. relevant quote article linked technology detect possible Covid-19 infection measuring electromagnetic waves, “which change [ribonucleic acid RNA] particles virus present person’s body”, media office reported. RNA typically acts messenger carrying instructions DNA.

Can anyone ELI5 whole electromagnetic wave emission predict rural areas state gonna bad time soon. Low vaccine rates. mask mandates. could die immediately cases Thankfully whole family in-laws vaccinated!....well except maybe in-laws Montana. I’ll let mother law deal lol. Last time texted sister law Montana said always wears mask around chin work big wigs around she’d pull still keep nose poking out. like “oh you’re one ppl”. asked going come visit like “well summer, maybe next.” never responded. Gloves spread transmit virus effectively hands. You’d change gloves often would wash sanitize ungloved hands. 

As biologist worked viruses lab, mention worn whole lot gloves, chose use gloves pandemic. yes boxes garage. trust bare skin greater awareness I’ve touched, feel safer without them. 

Not hands surfaces real problem, mind you. It’s air breathe.  Half adults 30 given covid vaccine.

Tell me, reading headline news refer to? I'm wearing masks they're mandatory, there's way I'm getting vaccine, sorry. swine flu ended I'm putting goofy ass shit body. I'll consider Theyre FDA approved though. hope one celebrity's wife pretended OK!/s Unless parent little there's nothing do.    get vaccinated, choose arm want injected? country, uptake slowed dramatically one month.

We june 600K+ first doses.

In July barely 200K+.


We even hit 40%.

FML looking (and hoping) for, thanks. Fantastic! Congrats USA! Great news. That's fucking shocker. Maybe Australia small population giant island continent better indicator death rate lockdowns. Almost every hospital where? when? Source. I'm saying everyone is, I'm third generation parents put private school kid. ex-wife went public school weeks parents know better. things I've heard seen public schools include ""I believe this, I'm required teach it..."" teacher covers entire theory evolution single class period rolling eyes.

I went college prep school costs $200,000 unaided tuition. college acceptance rate 100%, full-ride scholarship rate 95%, Ivy League acceptance rate 85%. PhDs teaching English Math learned write collegiate level essays. 

My ex-wife's first job college trying help 101 students learn write college essays writing-center type thing one college bookstores. shit show like never seen. 

I worked Mobile, Houston, Nashville, Huntsville, Atlanta, Phoenix, Nogalez, south work factory inspections pretty rural areas. 

My coworkers outside Montgomery. white-collar kids attending private schools enjoying education line would get nicer schools AL. saying public schools absolute shit, many are. 

My real point threw money Alabama's school system right is, schools wealthy areas towns would get amazing benefits poor schools would get worse.

One things Alabama (and saw every city lived) build new school white area towns, build current capacity under. 3,000 kids attending current overcrowded high school, new one serve 3,100 kids. law minority want move school majority white, may --except schools reject overcrowded.

Additionally, Alabama build nice communities gate build schools small neighborhood effectively private school area. 

What Mobile built school serves 95% old money neighborhoods building ""new"" school (they renamed existing shitty school added gym) re-zoned capture newest nicest neighborhoods new school run-down areas town bad ones. offset obvious racism capturing really huge beach resort homes new low-income school banking fact one paying $3,000,000 house really cares pickup cost private school would put kids private school anyway. 

Final point, Matt Massey made headlines Alabama refused build new school parents Madison County **blatantly** wanted draw zoning lines based income. can't find Facebook posts comments, parents basically got kid go school poors since poors already school that's 50% free lunch, drop new school right next neighborhoods million-dollar homes people living $40,000 houses continue go schools built 1960's. I'm saying public schools Alabama garbage. could name would put kids in. I'm saying went Alabama picked school random, chance 1% would pick school worth attending dumped money AL school system, would likely funding wealthy schools average education Alabama improve. Thank much. Probably giving third dose, given many people second dose already protect certain level probably land hospital for. also hurts small businesses it’s additional cost take account. deters people opening businesses leave employer’s coverage either overpay shit health insurance go without. dumb system. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That's correct. exactly 12 weeks think shots now. app vaccine tracking started counting 84 days next shot. Delta USA fascinating me. countries vaccines administered per population, delta quickly becoming dominant strain (50-70% cases). likely cause symptomatic breakthrough infections vaccinated (but yes, much milder unvaccinated), contagious variant long way. It’s crazy it’s ~14% USA, countries seeing clearly quickly dominate. don’t really understand why.

I’m Canada, health unit ~85% eligible population vaccinated (solid majority MRNA vaccines), schools closed since early April lockdowns, experiencing delta outbreak. doesn’t make sense USA lower vaccination rates lower health measures aren’t knee deep right now. long term effects Covid still discovered. Scares crap outta' me. Absolutely true. rough guess we'd need.

Note Pfizer vaccine seems sterilizing immunity least 80%, really silent carriers majority vaccine recipients. 100% vaccine coverage, we'd pretty close number Delta, though obviously get 100% coverage.

UK. Taipei, June 28 (CNA) Taiwan Monday reported 60 new cases COVID-19, lowest one month, three deaths disease, according Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

The daily number lowest since May 19, CECC first issued nationwide Level 3 COVID-19 alert, overall coronavirus numbers trending down, said Health Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), heads CECC.

Meanwhile, number infections Pingtung County cluster originated woman grandson recently returned Taiwan Peru remained 12, according Chen.

Eight people cluster confirmed infected Delta variant, believed transmissible variant yet, according CECC.

Although overall trend decline, larger expected crowds public venues weekend raised concerns infection control breach, Chen said.

Among 60 local cases recorded Monday, 26 males 34 females, aged 10 90, onset symptoms occurring June 19 June 27, according Chen.

In two cities considered Taiwan's COVID-19 hotspots, New Taipei new domestic cases reported Monday, 33, followed Taipei 22.

Outside two cities, Taoyuan reported two new cases, Keelung, Nantou Changhua reported one case each.

Of 60 new cases, sources 32 cases identified, sources 25 investigated, three determined unclear infection sources, CECC data showed.

The three deaths two men one woman 70s 90s, passed away June 25 June 26, CECC said.

The new cases brought total country 14,694, 13,200 domestic infections reported since May 15, country first recorded 100 cases single day first time since beginning outbreak early 2020.

To date, 635 people Taiwan died COVID-19, including 623 since May 15.

I’m curious given much spread prior vaccines released I’d think majority people US sort immunity haven’t really seen people talking it. 

Obviously want many people possible get shot regardless previous infection I’m curious theory way vaccines injected west vs countries like India (aspiration, syringe pulled back see there's blood).

Is real plausibility this? “We Darwin awardees” would appropriate No, blood clot major issue would reported thats widespread. Always hard way easy way. thing people getting covid once, getting sick isn’t fix  50% well herd immunity estimations even original strain Covid. Delta strain far contagious tell, thus herd immunity rate higher. 

That's also mention large portion already vaccinated UK got AZ jab, 10-20% less effective preventing cases best vaccines. stands reason although nearly 60% fully vaccinated, perhaps 45-50% truly going get covid. fair, highlighted entire pandemic, many parents depend able take kids daycare school order pay bills. like *want* take sick child school, simply choice. entire healthcare employment systems US fucked.

So probably virus, short amount time small number, cannot multiply already existing antibodies? Excellent point. IThankYou. friend works CDC. rank file staff pissed everyone else stunning incompetence. crucial lack leadership, lot best practices completely ignored last administration. Really?? would say that?!? 


/S needed....  Funerals attended 50 people?! Ai. Fantastic news! Giving boosters shots really going slow worldwide effort end pandemic. avoid would perfect Around Christmas got mini pack cheezits printed sticker saying thank it! See, care. Canada mixing vaccines, (or mRNA ones, think that's everywhere, right?). 

E.g. got AZ shot #1, Moderna #2. AZ #1, could gotten shot #2 well, wanted. somebody got Pfizer/Moderna #1 would get one #2, AZ.  One he's fully vaccinated, corona he's likely get pisswater people consider beer. ive caronavirus past first vaccine really need second covid vaccine? I’m sure better solution would been… I’m happy animals many animals rapidly mutating virus it’s hard say bad idea shut down. I’m hoping mink industry never recovers though. grandmother gave vintage mink coat hat (I ask it) absolutely loathe it. would help rural areas north, midwest, west, etc?

This ignorance everywhere. Flying going grocery store. can't think well state low, plane people way state India number countries worldwide vaccinated. Statically coconut trees don’t stand behind gas station. Hilarious. No, seriously. Lets joke potentially thousands Americans lives ruined people work office despite risks variants. great hear. Vaccination key getting mess. one wants needs lockdowns. 21 Pfizer 28 Moderna, got first dose early May second dose middle June, six week interval me.  agree points there’s often obstacles initially considered. 

I’ve read accounts people able risk getting sick shot calling out. Living paycheck paycheck makes people make difficult decisions focused tangible immediate future.  Meanwhile hospital feels like they've done everything support us threw BBQ day shift main hospital 🙄 well-known scientifically leading German virologist, Christian Drosten, said Covid-19 probably came animal farms China, captured animals would added. said ferret-like species know bats breeding going caves feast them, plausible contacted infected bats. - hypothesis based know SARS (Drosten expert SARS MERS Germany) - virus new reservoir species much closer humans bats.

To me, plausible theory far SARS-CoV-2 made jump humans.

Full text interview Drosten German: Canada they’re recommending people who’s received AstraZenca get either Moderna Pfizer second. don’t know it’s supply issues AZ. think soon, maybe September, Brazil donating too. 500 million doses bought entire population need something like 400 million (not counting Janssen that’s one dose only).

And still got 3 million Janssen donated US, imagine lot leftovers. they’d stop voting republican. Exactly. mink story something like 10 months old now. variant going cause waves, would done long time ago. Squeaky wheel gets grease? Kidding. 
It felt like complained loudest one point fortunately getting celebrate vigor. AstraZeneca may *the best* vaccine there, still great vaccine importantly cheap. Many luxury choice, AstraZeneca much better vaccine either nothing waiting months another vaccine. “Huge amount vaccinated people getting covid”

This simply true. made post precisely demonstrating false statement. Currently working vaccine clinic. mixing different vaccine brands. got one other, that's it, least now. people got one brand vaccine, well got non-US vaccines, wanted try swap Moderna/Pfizer. Though, we've deny them. eat shit gov tells solution protect delta variants.

As appose you, believe random person internet convinced real stupid comprehend science works.

If came it, I'd rather eat shit die stupidity. never said anything contrary Honestly, point get vaxxed don’t think you’re probably part several present social problems. Remember rare…all viruses rare extreme situations. spike protein best ""bang buck"" terms stopping infection first place

But also contagious, easily bind ACE2. mutate away this, sudden we're dealing situation anymore spread easily. thought second shot booster shot already. lol. people need second shots third? mean forth one? maybe fifth well  They're worried extremely rare blood clot, live continent filled deadliest animals planet. Thanks! :)  show good strategy delay second doses countries lack vaccines. able give first doses people, eventual protection second dose even greater.

It necessarily 45 weeks doses, helps establishing upper limit. know delaying second dose *up to* 45 weeks give worse protection, rather contrary. bullshit paywalls articles public health

I know want result be, I'm NY Times tell can't charge people read Public Health stories I'm covering Public Health much. irony. said, ain't looking good. Gosh wish english. It’s entirely supply issue Statistically, many things kill kids, higher rate covid. mean start destroying coconut trees, exterminating every bear, banning cars. Imagine horrible society would thing acceptable risk. completely nuts much finger pointing government, we're pace fully vaccinate 12 older group 75% coverage *by end July*. Toronto smashed North American record yesterday 27,000 shots given one location, logistical masterclass also barometer general interest.

Canada stands good chance avoid Delta-driven fourth wave, we're totally pace first large-population country reach levels called herd immunity. tremendous success around. Aussies apathetic lulled false sense security cases throughout pandemic long periods community spread restrictions all. Apart Victorian wave never got bad Australia all, even mild global standards (although lockdown solved one worlds harshest) point, laugh risk going insane. Really wondering things gonna look come fall. honestly sounds like Australia restrictions Texas point.  Oh, thank dog ! Vaccine Efficacy [calculated relative infections control group compared treatment group. People groups randomize anything happening vaxxed group happen non-vaxxed group study.

For example, using made numbers here:

In low infection rates scenario: 

  Control: COVID Incidence: 0.1%
  Vaccine: COVID Incidence: 0.005%

Vaccine efficacy (0.1% - 0.005%) / 0.1% * 100 = 95%

Similarly, increase infection rate groups 100x, efficacy still same:

  Control: COVID Incidence: 10.0%
  Vaccine: COVID Incidence: 0.5%
  
Vaccine efficacy still (10% - 0.5%) / 10% * 100 = 95% turns out, extreme concentrations wealth power make youthful brains ""elderly"" well. Australia plan close borders annually flu season too?  Sorry, bad translation. german ""infiziert"" ""The purely mechanical process infectious agents come contact host called infection."" think english word that. ""infektion"", means infection. AstraZeneca offers 60% effectiveness infection delta variant. Though give lot prevention hospitalization, death!

This means - 50% population vaccinated AstraZeneca - 60% people immune infection delta variant.

This means 30% population immune infection. (I hope got maths right!) [And - US spellchecker - changing 'math'!]

The generally accepted number, percentage population needed immune infection, give herd immunity, around 60%

The UK still far achieving - Delta announced today actually, talk doctor get AZ 60 Definitely nearly deadly sure overload hospitals medical care inevitable god man, you’ve responded like half comments attacking raising valid points.

You quick search subreddit alone pull number studies drunken math off, thanks correction. still need step though.  always 95% effective best. Almost vaccines use double-shot, two doses needed individual.

Sure, Johnsson&amp;Johnsson exists single-dose, hand countries administering third doses vaccines evens out. vaccines made Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna set persistent immune reaction body may protect coronavirus years, scientists reported Monday. 
 
The findings add growing evidence people immunized mRNA vaccines may need boosters, long virus variants evolve much beyond current forms — guaranteed. 

People recovered Covid-19 vaccinated may need boosters even virus make significant transformation.

I asthma, I’ll admit, it’s little difficult breathe sometimes, don’t mind help vaccine can’t help. Yeah lot good evidence outdoors, even unvaccinated, pretty low risk. got Sinopharm country lived. country I’m citizen consider “fully vaccinated” therefore I’d subject quarantine travel whereas vaccinated people not. country lived saying can’t get two doses Pfizer I’ve already Sinopharm, agree Sinopharm doesn’t enough immunity recommends get *one* booster shot Pfizer, would still make considered vaccinated home country. disconnected reality feeling people call “brain fog”, covid back October/November Brian fog hard deal with. among last remove mask laws, probably first reimplement them.

(Ditto NJ, NY, OR, WA) got J&amp;J back March. far good. I'm seriously thinking getting Pfizer Moderna early fall safe... received Pfizer vaccine would beneficial get J&amp;J vaccine?

*Probably* not. mimic spike protein, benefit would negligible. Add J&amp;J vaccine uses adenovirus vector, get J&amp;J vaccines made using adenovirus, may eligible different vaccine future using said adenovirus.

So yeah, sit tight there's official recommendation anything else.  Source huge amounts vaccinated people? google search didn’t find huge amounts (~4000 153M people vaccinated hospitalized with, necessarily due COVID, equivalent 0.002% vaccinated people)

Great! fuck, then.  Yes, fortunately eliminated cluster-5 variant spread human population.

A genetic recombination event may resulted Y453F mutation passed high risk variants like delta. Could led another variant exceptionally high binding affinity ACE2. take heart, people pulling chain try get reaction you. risk clots super low, symptoms treatments already well known now.

There's ton's videos protection rate really means, too. well protected J&amp;J. good thing got it. got vaccinated US recommended interval 3 weeks (for Pfizer least, maybe 4 weeks Moderna). seems US least happy continue shorter interval.  thats comparison NZ make sense all, fantastic job better everyone else, comparison didnt make sense. really hard time logic here. articles make case Delta affect kids worse strains. They're proof Delta yet well-studied.

But predicted, address primary issue said wouldn't: high percentage kids long-term symptoms Covid.

Also, kids go hospital, die Covid. Regardless variant.

Your diversion ""but experts think Delta ***seem*** worse kids!"" merely dodges issue variants bad kids. ""Not dead"" equal fine / worries.

I've given 16 months life, giving anymore. risk getting seriously sick variant fully vaccinated person close 0. continue staying home irrational fear choose. heard Delta Variant Delta Plus?

People thinking taking approach like Australia’s plan lockdown double digit Covid numbers feasible US really set disappointment.

My dad thinks US should’ve taken Australia’s approach reason didn’t didn’t try hard enough.  Great. urge people wear masks much want. vaccine 90% effective Delta variant though I'm going worry it. I'll wear wherever business requires worn required mask staying car. Well worth, Belgium 75% eligible, 60% population.

LMAO, time live in! Well, young people article mentions. 

They still get vaccinated, young person lethality covid much less influenza-A. virus really seek out.

Ah yes I'm glad latest mutation comes heat-seeking augment. 
I'm joking, get point. Totally agree rampage unvaccinated. vaccine it? say least 2 million doses month. specific say 4000 L/month. 0.5 mL Novavax dose, that's like 8 million month. hope pumping adult side slice population every 4 months also exporting/donating enough annually vaccinate another 32 million people elsewhere.  made mind month ago acted accordingly, heavily restricting entry UK. both.

If read comment chain start might understand we're talking past other. Anyway silly conversation lets leave it. That's true all. Immunocompromised people encouraged get need it. immunocompromised vaccine contraindication. Nice meet virtually well. nice vaccinated area It’s bit infuriating actually go ahead get another shot country first dose isn’t happening least one month :( Wow. Sense humor found. And, strangely, ""floor joist foundation injection site"" post OK? Whatever. Spain vaccinated people don’t need masks outdoors everyone? seems little transmission outdoors.

I still wear mine lot NYC it’s required public transit it’s easier keep it. take walking dogs park though. others said, yet. may point though. really concern J&amp;J going wear anytime soon concern protecting Delta (India) variant. Right UK 1-2 months ahead dealing variant Pfizer/Moderna protecting effectively enough. data J&amp;J shown kinds numbers yet vaccine prevalent Europe.

It's paywalled info lost upon me. Plus loved ones stranded overseas. I'm UK girlfriend Melbourne. seen well year. Meanwhile, US, CDC holding obvious likely efforts (masks!) evidence ""wasn't conclusive.""  got Pfizer followed AstraZeneca showed antibody levels five times high two doses AstraZeneca. month ago know mink farm is?

Do think milked live quiet retirement?

Do think? data evidence shows killed could fighting antibody-resistant strain already deadly virus.

Let's honest here, minks living fur farms living greatest lives going killed regardless.  Yes, use viral vector tech instead mRNA. J&amp;J uses human virus, AZ uses chimp one. seems risk blood clots side effect, there's much controversy around compared mRNA ones That's thing. Aussie govt stuck gambler's fallacy kind situation. ever change tactic decide accept moderate circulation virus inevitable, people ask locked much last year. ask forbidden seeing overseas loved ones long going change tactic anyway. recall Quebec March 40% Quebec known Canadian province people following rules most. There’s way moment that’s it’s lower 60% people breaking rules either occasionally time. us AstraZeneca first dose, also adenovirus viral vector vaccine, recommended mRNA second short. I’m somewhat expecting recalled third shot mRNA later fall. protected delta variant.

Not sure worried about. hate people won’t let change opinion. Like somebody changes view something someone like “oh you’re hypocrite! said (blah) 4 years ago! Don’t try backtrack this!” it’s like sorry friend allowed change mind? develop new opinion based current level knowledge like, don’t know, critical thinker? want never evolve grow? source that’s find?

Asking seen many articles like response delta variant. believe Canada officially recommending mRNA booster AZ single dose. EU definitely far target. Belgium think you’re right. there’s much vaccines hesitancy, supplies confirmed long term, mid august seems like right timeframe. 

Our reopening plan however talks 70% adults fully vaccinated September 1, that’s likely gonna achieved month earlier. Lol georgias rollout ass still require booster shot? I’m moving France September fuckin hope step end goal? get situation? workplace dress code says wear pants wear shorts everyday, it’s hot.

Now, change happens every couple months single year. They’re (Baby Boomers Gen X’ers) used scares them. posted sources.... posting speculation. Hello?!?! saying exact thing they've saying since last year. new variant. advised maskless*. 

I'm saying covid real. I'm saying real. I'm also saying going away. Ever. OMG OK, next time probably quote article. read it, last two sentences said something Biden noting unlike vaccine diplomacy e.g. China, vaccines deliveries abroad U.S. good world political requirements attached. able stay masked work? donating quotes Everyone needs wearing damn masks still.

Covid joke. send kids school online, even home school can. Delta variant going total mess many people false sense security current vaccines.

People kids need spending extra time them, shit hard them. Take hiking, bike riding, camping, etc.. Anything away crowds. hear North Korea pretty good approach call get second dose showed up. I'm saying get Pfizer-​BioNTech getting J&amp;J, PB&amp;J. noted Q3 Q4, Australia going receive enough Pfizer Moderna vaccines vaccinate entire country twice. It’s unfortunate waited long, fairness, didn’t problem now. certainly feel flight attendant case, I'm curious legal perspective. could possibly prove became infected due SWA's negligence, matter even infected SWA training. Further, subsequently infecting husband within SWA's legal responsibility, provable opposed infected elsewhere?

/sincere question, trying defend SWA Dr. Snape. Potions Master? always knew it’s difficult Covid taught it’s constant challenge. really gained extra perspective struggle people go daily basis. wished could get vaccine getting mine least could do. I’m grateful got mine week ago. It’s exhausting feel them.  wife decide ready start kids? many years talking? Covid conspiracy theory.  point obvious, thought. If, viruses world affect humans, one ever eradicated speak extreme difficulty unique circumstances needed eradicate virus. Smallpox slow mutating virus without non-human reservoirs. One exposure smallpox vaccine gives LONG lasting immunity (on scale decades), wiped among humans animals affects harbor disease pass back humans later time.

Covid fits neither categories. already seen evolve least part escape immunity prior infection immunization - though much slowly much less completely influenza instance - known animal reservoirs. would make attempt complete eradication orders magnitude difficult, impossible. also FAR less deadly smallpox effort required attempt total eradication may simply worth it. telling diseases like influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis, rotavirus - diseases mass vaccinate ongoing basis - eradicated. They're controlled greatest degree reasonably possible.

Even escape sterilizing immunity, people reinfected infected vaccination seen far less severe cases people immunologically naive. Mass vaccination prevent hospitalization death, coupled natural immunity large fraction people already infected, reduce orders magnitude dangerous disease covid society. cat's bag disease endemic human population, animal reservoirs. onus proponent eradication make case virus uniquely susceptible eradication, uniquely deserving eradication efforts, compared list dangerous infectious diseases eradicated. Lmao! disagree first part 80 million donation. They’ve ordered 500 million Pfizer donations. Yes.
(This bad way communicate anything remotely nuanced)
My point is, taken responsibility thus far, make them?
I agree unfair.
AND want get COVID-so choice have?
 guess I'm clear mean ""at point"". make happen? cover non-aca plans? Lmao CDC’s updated numbers state 33% African-Americans received least one vaccine 38% Hispanic people received least one vaccine, despite readily availability vaccines minority communities. aren’t taking it. 

Asians far vaccinated ethnicity, long shot.

CDC: think paper looking people 65 years age? That’s drives nuts. “Ooh. It’s like flu.” No. after-effects awful. mean, that’s science. data available guidances change. People need understand works. don’t get that’s hard understand Congrats Canada! sure wish Americans got mrssage herd immunity like guys seem have. border reopens, unless Mexico pay wall. hope get back parks again. Right? Like yes, learn change recommendations. like knowing there's car crash ahead interstate knowing lane get closer. How's specifically, would like ""make minds""?

It's like someone gets sit declare ""voila, need booster!"" ""you need booster!"" so. fact virus vaccines constantly learning about, can't ""make mind"" boosters needed want answer. reality dependent facts ground. US begun exporting vaccines, donating vaccines directly expiring. first 80 million donation announced. Yes, bad things happen world. I’m sorry you’re realizing this. Yeah workout doesnt kill muscle cells, different type stimulation induces growth. zero covid strategy impossible achieve don’t really see benefit using two different vaccines, risks. antibodies spike protein get second vaccine literally prints copies spike protein would one two things. Immediately neutralize spike protein little benefit additional protection. could hyperactive immune system catastrophic effects. syndrome called antibody enhancement serious know little specialty. sounds like talking ""generic"" Covishield vaccine made India, copy AZ's vaccine. Many people EU European-made AZ vaccines, pass EMA quality control checks.

The weaker vaccines general problem EU wants eventual elimination, since gives poor sterilizing immunity even original sars-cov-2 strain. course know AZ single dose mRNA gives extremely good antibody levels (the best correlate sterilizing immunity), medium term easy fix. Yep. Australia population roughly 2.5 times US state Georgia yet Georgia distributed almost million doses Australia has. Yeah, country used too. sister got vaccine(sinovac) last month, yesterday tested positive. tested positive last december without symptoms too, time worse. You… really look US doing. 75% 80 million initial donation *are Covax*. 

Only 25% direct. *are* making messaging go along every day learn new things get data incorporate. one knows everything COVID, long-term impacts, potential variants, etc., learn steadily improve guidance recommendations. would concerned kept saying exact thing face new information. died loved Haha! Love analogy! It’s big deal, honestly. types cells body life span, they’re constantly dying, broken down, replaced. worst, vaccine causes early death bit muscle size head pin. damage muscle hard workout. Thanks! still happening I'm going ignore that. Yeah, one really shocked me. well earlier! Jesus Christ. 18 months still flu shit? AZ first dose moderna second dose, 9 weeks apart. bodes well. lots people wrong internet, especially cesspool like youtube comments. May well say peace leave that, never convince crazies. study finds Pfizer Moderna vaccines could offer protection years: **excellent** news sure. really anti growth mindset rally around, applies aspects life. example, grandfather’s cousin argues paying golf lessons said I’m better teaching myself, don’t diagnose you’re wrong outside eye you’ll never know needs improved guy gets heart hurts  hiding anything? 

Again, take entire job melt one simple yes fit sin situations can't, hiding something? Lol 

Are twisting facts purpose? Lol  covid late december/early january. double shot pfizer march/april lots things still smell cant smell all. 

for instance cant smell anything rose related. used bronners tea tree castile soap stop tea tree smells like burnt rubber Poll: would rather... Well sometimes Rupert Murdoch wants world feel alarmed, wants world feel saved.

 depends stock prices politics, like everything else US. Pretty cool manipulate demand supply media huh ? 

What society wants believes tradable commodity. 4 cases COVID total area yesterday. odds running someone COVID point really, really low I’ve shots months. I’ve played nice, wore mask everywhere, even places optional, I’m sick assholes around couldn’t bothered mask vaccinate themselves. I’m done trying considerate them. I’ll wear mask go medical facilities visit retirement home something, things like going grocery store I’m done unless store requires data saying shots received aren’t good protection variants state. when's earliest get Pfizer/Moderna 2 shot solution since J&amp;J appears cheap knockoff brand good stuff? booster gotta get? Figures get one done need 2nd shot anyways lol

Wonder free future shots well, assume they'll expensive next time around? Interesting. Based comments sub others, already Gospel virus considerably deadlier. God hate arguing people YouTube comments saying got covid fine after. Saying people treat bodies like trash people treat bodies like trash ones get it, baffles me.

Is people denying end cardiovascular damage road makes irritated. 

How would guys respond people conspiracies, anti-vax, people don’t believe variants? sounds like can't handle simple adult ideas like.. things change. 

Just stop watching news literally can't handle facts. 

Every variant introduces new set possibilities. research counter test it. short test long tests. results seem contradictory first. contradictory even. 

This part process franky sounds like mature enough handle narrative maybe longer two/three letters, yes/no. 

Think job someone demanding melt absolute yes situations. would probably think person immature idiot. bullshit phenomenon guidance really changing. gone ""we know long immunity last. We're optimistic can't make recommendations without data."" ""we data now. good!"" That’s entirely reasonable shit?  get confirmation heart gonna grow 3 sizes chest? I’m Grinch cosplay Christmas want part play too, whole thing authentic. Agreed! It’s happens people desperate answer isn’t known yet, media needs engage viewers, opinion. news happily latch onto something that’s still state flux present fact know people drink it’s better knowing 😕 (J&amp;J, yay one jab) agree person you’re replying to. can’t believe fast everyone willing throw bodily autonomy, letting government create divide people take substance otherwise clubs, work, nothing you. doubt lot ""positives"" asymptomatic breakthroughs see vaccinated (ie: believed viral load low transmission unlikely).

Why would assume unless testing conducted random? There's reason asymptomatic vaccinated individuals would feel need go get tested, think theory correct here. Politicians literally get criticized ""flip floppers"" this. Odds likely misinterpreting headlines actually conflict. main complaint along lines terrible high school science education is. graduated 20 years ago well regarded high school, basic science mostly babysitting. advanced classes SIX total people including me. ones worth anything. cell molecular bio major almost bio classes completely new information me, made first year rougher been.

Studies shown delta variant \_really\_ want wait full 6 weeks engaging potentially risky activities. efficacy Pfizer vaccines delta greatly reduced one shot. Nope wearing mask ever know I’ll fine! Sorry bro! realize fact checking isn’t free, right? It’s lot easier make shit chase sources. Got first dose California. Moved NY next week. NYS said wait 6 months could get first dose again. said fuck found CVS 3 hours away new apartment would get second dose. gonna play games I'm glad Delta creeping study sample size 14 people. also heatlhcare. South region expand Medicaid lot poor people doctors. Since doctors, get little medical care trust doctors. doom loop. sample size study 14 people. 

“Dr. Ellebedy’s team found 15 weeks first dose vaccine, germinal center still highly active 14 participants, number memory cells recognized coronavirus declined.”  Good reporting costs money. Good reporters deserve paid well order good reporters writing good news reports requires company paying reporters make money ads enough. want clickbait go free shit. Anecdotally, I've found first time got sick restrictions loosened (hadn't sick year!), hit like TRUCK. I've heard others say same. think immune system overexcited. I’m talking donate export. USA donate 500million+ vaccines cost  Rapid tests reliable indicators, get PCR test done (which usually needs 24 hour turnaround time). problem isn’t changing advice based evidence, problem giving advice based little (scientifically obtained) evidence scientific process actually time run it’s course provide *actual* evidence occasionally contradictory original advice. problem people can’t say “we don’t know time” obviously make many people resistant idea vaccine. ""Variants? Shmariants."" -Dr. Monica Gandhi vaccine effectiveness variants. 

She first vocal voice getting people masking public, think knows CNN. feel AZ Moderna: that's going change hurry. end week canada enough supply hit 75% available people 2nd doses July. dunno ever met target numbers sub contracted plants production issues. Guinea Worm, too. Thanks Jimmy Carter!  high UV light concentration virus much less able survive outdoors? ask, Australia surely give perforated ozone layer.  Go get tested.

The country experiencing massive surge infections, President Cyril Ramaphosa said announced new wideranging lockdown nationwide address Sunday.

The third wave currently centered Gauteng, South Africa's economic engine. scientists said 'matter days' impact Delta variant spreads provinces. don’t think it’s much scientific process issue much way it’s reported public. makes total sense people lose faith science way read every day it’s flip-flopping constantly, trust it? reality needs presented better way. Um.. yes.

Deaths hospitalisations rising slowly. Vaccine programme well. Health care unlikely overwhelmed. reason stay shut. got you. daily counts quarantined boarder?  makes sense. digging study mentioned looks like they’re still recruiting. 30% goal. Priya Duggal. couldn’t find anything Heinrich. Nah bro gonna MaSk Up! Sorry honest response brave (on Reddit places) wanted let know internet stranger proud you. takes lot self-reflection look preconceived notions biases CHANGE interest collective good. That's *huge* step proud it. hope whatever side effects might get minimal, get major ones, breathe easy knowing effects temporary still better risking long COVID death. Stay safe big THANK part! 💜 also endemic two countries now, Pakistan Afghanistan. going rough countries eliminate in, 21 countries 10 years ago. Pretty amazing progress. It’s based decades research past studies vaccines. read article linked? It’s based conjecture, it’s based **science**. Science theorizing, testing, refining theory. constantly improves, continue improve nature science. mRNA could well revolutionize medical industry many ways.  think it’s going take longer months. enrolled sons (1 4) moderna trial several months back. called us last week tell us 4 year old wait list 2-6yr trial starts 29th. trial set run year. Based info, 6 getting vaccinated fall wishful thinking. sure tell you; science works. collect data make recommendations experiments on-going, people re-run old experiments using new technologies updated assumptions find old data isn’t *exactly* right still pretty close, continually provide recommendations know. 

It would amazing know everything know something able provide data common person right away set; it’ll never happen way. 

To address specific concerns, though:

- Delta variant 100% treated seriously, **unprotected** much likely get since it’s much transmissible. 

- current vaccines authorized still offer protection **hospitalized** **suffering severe disease** (though don’t offer complete protection virus entering body.)

- **CDC** recommended fully vaccinated people forego masks, also consider still wearing we’re still collecting data well vaccinated folks actually spread others (looking again, Delta). 

- **WHO** one making recommendation everyone mask up, keep mind they’re global presence every country getting vaccine coverage US is, it’s still huge worry countries. 

Hope helps. Even considering lag hospitalisations deaths way would without vaccines.

Cases still matter nowhere near much used to. [KCL found last month vaccinated seems reduce risk long COVID test positive vaccination, reduces older people younger. unfortunately still vaccinated people test positive still symptoms 28 days, say severe symptoms follow longer that.

It's also small sample size, since million vaccinated people database, couple thousand tested positive. idea much difficult vaccinate population size states compared Canada? Canada’s population centered effectively three cities, Montréal, Vancouver, Toronto. Canada much homogenous. Yeah, Alberta folk, generally, it’s totally different place US. enough PTO get every six months. either need fix figure lay four days. Same. I'm pro-vaccine, Moderna gave crippling joint pain times took month recover time. Plus laid two days time fever shaking.

Every booster means subjecting significant discomfort. I'm willing catch covid, fucking sucks know could subject twice year.

My friends took Pfizer much less strong reactions. going regular thing, think I'll choice switch vaccines see less brutal. get groceries? Yeah that's science works. aim improve people's critical thinking rather roll new information chunks make easier people process delay so. would children growing up.

If cared much children, spend time instead dealing dangerous drugs? kids better without her. nothing parasite society. world better people like prison. country, Denmark, Astra Zeneca part official vaccination program either, get personally ask doctor allows use you. regard, remind Australia well! Yay 😁 carry show mild symptoms. year thing still figured out? family tree stick... EU countries make people countries dealing papers doctors’ turn around borders. Backwards German practices cute zero patience stuff like now. fix damn central database stop going abroad mkay. don’t believe there’s adjuvant moderna vaccines. There’s two reason strong response. A) don’t really know lowest effective dose kinda rough guess based phase 1 trials. B) mRNA cause immune responses.

Interestingly look next gen vaccines trying solve problem self replicating mRNA. instead one mRNA copy resulting one spike protein, one mRNA copy could multiply inside cell 10 copies. would greatly lower dose needed theory reduce immune response. What? people responding referring mixing vaccines general, specifically Moderna v. Pfizer…. always thought general consensus Aus US Nz like Canada. source last claim? (vast majority asymptomatic) clearly know talking about, hun. dealing higly evolving virus new variant concern showing affects children even more, expert doubting anymore delta variant. 

Don't know many kids got infected god knows many died (India deaths undercounted six times, 1,2 million deaths unnaconteud yet, never will) second wave India variant delta, beggining dominate strains worldwide? 79,688 children infected virus March 1 April 4.

So apparently discussed least. Vegetarian introvert sassy here. Yes animal testing...still need live. animals. 7 day average cases county 3 per day, 1/100,000. I'm wearing mask low odds. that's true I'm sure we'll start seeing results soon. far UK death tolls moved. They're close single digits daily.  Niggardly???? may gotten without knowing (no symptoms) hurt people giving them. 

Though appears care hurt people anyway. outbreak among Finnish people traveled bus St. Petersburg,  literally know single person like that. seem like progressive perspective issue either. 

One friend able get vaccinated health reasons set first shot tomorrow. Every time interact full masks even though every friend fully vaccinated. virus NEVER 'cared' responsible wasn't. GOT variants now.
Viruses intentions. replicate search hosts survive. Well seems ripe going way supreme court, probably plan along. Dismissing grounds cause lawsuits really fair judgement. there's concern many lawsuits law changed, cases thrown out.  I’ve got problems tanks. We’re allies. wake new information, possibility armor piercing rounds, may wise tank drivers accept fact wearing extra protection doesn’t make dick appear smaller, may help others. end day, people trying get shot. Respect that. get second shot end July country need appointment. love ffp2 masks. hand sanitizer. Vaccine protection compared unvaccinated population, 0% = unvaccinated person. Really.
When expect this?
And really taking responsibility, would get vaccinated. Interesting! heard MIS-C ago. could read, rare. you, chance, find data probability MIS-C?

It would interesting see exactly ""rare"" is, compares ""rare"" side-effects vaccines (like myocarditis thrombosis).

For kids really need extra careful risks vs. benefits balance may different older age categories. Unfortunately, centralised system storing information Germany (data protection; federalised systems; etc.). means people get digital certificate taking yellow vaccination passports written vaccination confirmation pharmacy, analog information turned digital certificate.

Which means people forge analog information (easy enough do) order slip information digitised system stay forever, undetected. around 2x flu extrapolation accounting many peoples get tested. even 10x flu still like 50x less small pox. Open reader view. doesn’t work try private mode. sometimes gets rid paywall. agree public health articles free.  short-term vs long-term tradeoff.  ok partial protection ~1-2 months waiting 2nd shot exchange durable long-term protection? 

with delta rattling around think shifts risk tradeoff favor getting shot sooner. hermit fantastic imo Vaccines clearly broken link cases hospitalization deaths, look UK's last outbreak, cases hospitalizations deaths closely linked, cases rose 10x, hospitalizations deaths. Same. laying bed sick dog last thing needed hear day vaccine day going give blood clots. Lol. fine 2 months later. :'( poor minks Bro lmao know exposed go get tested monitor symptoms. Great job let’s start focusing ending worldwide. agree said. would important proper risk assessment (with actual numbers models) freaking kids going get amputated due covid. likely *extremely* rare occurrence warrant extra precautions.

But done thorough analysis. I'm wrong, significant concern significant amount children, means what's right protect children. sure. sympathize. PO box Montana able empty since early March.

Hoping get soon, though I'll quick in-and-out anything else there. ready yet. (But get US, avoid quarantine return. I'm fully vaccinated Friday week.)

Might worth getting xray done someone doesn’t drive, I’m hoping grocery delivery still exists future try get place own. Paywall vaccines present antigen immune system via different mechanisms build other; two *not full* doses, two full doses, one vaccine instead two full doses vaccine.

preliminary safety analysis in; slightly higher side effects 2nd shot vs. two shots mean hope would. That’s point vaccine. there’s point. Sputnik made two different adenoviruses tell, one used JnJ. problem line thinking (kids get sniffles etc..) idea long term effects COVID be. 

I disagree hypothesis here. I've lost 4 people close healthy comorbidities. Kids spread this. also gives virus ample time hosts mutate even potent variant. Perhaps variant vaccine resistant.

You correct medicine risk v. reward aspect it. case, personal feeling risk contracting/spreading becoming seriously gravely ill global pandemic still present reward getting vaccine children is....*what?* Amazing  point vaccines, especially non mRNA ones, reduce mortality, prevent infection completely. Cuba’s medical world good, vaccine probably really good, too.  It’s definitely awesome, doesn’t change fact still vulnerable others still freely “shooting”. I’m driving tank, wife one convertibles, kids running around traffic. Ok everyone, trucks ready...

Literally extent “plan”. Eating indoors gonna take awhile come back since it’s one things experts aggressive telling people avoid, see increased takeout, delivery, curbside pickup options restaurants big part Post-Covid world. 

It’ll probably stick around grocery stores well, since they’re essential business people still vulnerable post-vaccine can’t avoid.  Nothing perfect putting words mouth. 

I also linked quote Pfizer official I'm sure would question I'm right said, right there. 

I vaccinated, wife vaccinated, baby people around without mask current transmission info have. That's all. Hello, report there's also lot interesting info twitter. asked Twitter could specific. Let’s wait see. Good. sensible. Pair disincentive though. Thank you! Canada beginning give people second doses, spent long prioritizing first doses. States, could get second dose soon three weeks passed first dose. 

Comparing Canada US bit silly though, entire population Canada amounts less people say, California’s population. US incredibly diverse place, different places different compliance forth. 53% US population amounts 165 million people fully vaccinated, compared Canada’s approx 38 million 30% vaccinated, amounts 12 million people. Accordingly, amount people fully vaccinated Canada nearly 14x less United States. California administered [41 million Canada administered nearly [24 use statistics paint different picture compare entire country, comparison pretty useless view. put simply, US done far, far better job vaccines Canada, Australia, UK.

With regards Canada’s rollout: It’s bad country manufacturing capability (which surprising, considering Canada supposedly rich country), pales comparison US long, long margin. genius. According what?  fail see practicality this. Especially vaccinated...  studies coming id wait. 2 dose study coming august jj specific trials. 


More likely booster needed everyone within 2 years due virus mutating body ineffective. virus chamce mutate enough pple vaccinated giving large pool grow change on. majority vaccine pool shrinks. 

But virus mutates enough vaccine say.. 75% gives chance continue mutate 25% pool. (Plus unvaccinated )

Give everyone booster number goes back to95% covered shrinks enough possible herd immunity likely small pool mutation growth. 

Then maybe booster every ten years still growing shifting time unvaccinated pple. 

Not mention possibility random shit. Like hiv population africa pple well enough live sick enough stay sick year theyve found huge breeding grounds mutations None numbers article consistent sources taken total population (71% Belgium Malta wrong, Bulgaria figure). look current vaccination rates, EU considerably speed reach 70% total population end July. reach 70% adults though say Belgium reached 70% adult population (75 actually 60 total). talk 58% figure full population. it’s unclear. stopped taking vacation longer thought benefits enjoying time outweighed anxiety going work.  larger number quarantines ever subjected one, get Pfizer Moderna country offering (eg, US). that, respective company's websites CDC three say this. ""Don't get first one Brand A, try get booster shot Brand B."" did! Even correct Pfizer (or hasn't) published, problem message sounds bit like 100% convinced Covid-19 vaccines perfect. That's problematic opinion have. ever go zero: could long time, U.S. cease exist next 100 years so, example.  We've gone three day week reporting. It’s refusal vaccinated that’s now. agree refusing vaccination goes along masks distancing. Yet another example vaccines work. Sounds like norovirus. Pretty common cruise ships understand. many? 1? 50? 1M? Without numbers compounding factors, straight fear mongering highest order. grew Birch Bay 90 days cutoff health agencies expect new positive test mean new infection rather shedding old one. pretty arbitrary.

People anxiety disorders often think rationally. talk exclusively terms fear. know often suffer thing. made comments subreddit day similarly alarmist, deleted anxiety-induced half-trolling add anything discussion. okay cautious, falling self-destructive behavior, probably time log off. think intervening set path never end continue get shots every 5 years? seems like pretty profitable idea Agreed, lack data JnJ getting annoying. I'm debating mRNA booster. conversation adults needing get vaccinated reduce spread protect children can't get vaccinated. 

An example brought cars, deaths children that. 

I pointed TON things, intrusive things, combat that. 

Your response ""but nah lockdowns!"" 

You whacking straw man, argument issue here, disingenuous attempt change subject grounds feel stronger you. might well telling earth round. 

I must point out, though, rural availability still sucks 5 months. TL;DR: Maybe, risk downside getting 2nd jab completing medically-recommended vaccine series two shots? 80% Americans vaccinated MMR, put vaccination rates perspective  That’s wild me. number doses representative amount resources required deploy vaccine, larger number doses required per person means difficult rollout. 2 doses twice difficult 1 dose, 3 doses 50% difficult 2 doses, etc.

There's also strong argument longer spaced vaccines produce efficient rollout give little bit protection larger number people. Two doses 12 weeks spacing giving 33% protection first dose gives greater protection society three doses 1 week spacing giving 90% protection. That's considering effect transmission. start looking hospitalisations deaths, situation much strongly favours longer spacing. Even AZ gives 71% reduction hospitalisations single dose, point impossible argue shorter spacing offers protection public health. Hello, Corona virus vaccination card isn’t new ones (US) small card like. Mines huge. 

My job wants use app called Clear app requires scan it, can’t read mine huge piece paper. 

I called number ask could email said couldn’t help happens people big piece paper.

Is places turn card? anywhere go maybe makes copy get scanned? referring immune response result vaccine start, though.

On population level, army people swords. I'm reading Los Alamos scientists making bomb absolutely true science works - everything much U-235 needed best container make chain reaction, assumed one thing quickly found wrong change course. factors determined number new cases per day along factors testing positivity rates. counties listed “high risk,” state seeing consistent case surge like last winter 3,000 people hospitalized January.

But Alabama isn’t reporting new cases per day. individual counties reporting daily cases? miss going Blaine. Nothing better stopping Edaleen ice cream way pick US Amazon packages lol hypothetical someone said done science X solution, someone comes along disagrees, say “you’re idiot, science says X answer” say, “maybe you’re right, proof evidence support this” everyone treating word science like kind label absolute truth it’s literally method FIND truths even certain Imagine that; vaccine didn’t get disease!  Maybe everybody able get vaccine. woulda thunk it? Anyone know % hospitalized vaccinated? sub tendency downvote cautious people btw (sorry that, it’s totally reasonable question!)

Some things consider: 
-are high risk (preexisting conditions, old age etc) 
-where located (ie south delta quickly becoming dominant)
-which vaccine (in previous Reddit post posted couple studies provide Pfizer effective fighting delta specifically)
-you always wear mask right? 

I think overall though, well protected covid delta vaccinated. understand anxiety. feel comfortable with. :) might get awkward Canadians vaccinated AZ despite [cutesy analogy used politicians Western-made AZ Indian Covishield recipe made different seems EU, ""kitchen"" ""dish"" prepared become part criteria determining eligibility incoming non-EU citizens later year.

The problem [Canada date received 2.9 million doses coming COVAX (made South Korea), Serum Institute (made India Covishield) USA (through Biden's loan unused unapproved American inventory). far I'm aware, [500,000 doses Indian-licensed AZ arrived Canada second half pretty much used first doses beginning April.

Strictly speaking, EU would need scrutinize every incoming Canadian's vaccination history determine his/her actual dosing regimen been. case, EU would (should?) filter incoming Canadians found received first dose AZ March early April since drawn Indian delivery. Biden's loan AZ start getting used around middle April later followed South Korean loot via COVAX. interesting thank thoughtful response flight Florida Frankfurt Aug 31 lays-over Lisbon. isnt great news :( must know someone immunocompromised another illness prevents vaccination, right? them, wouldn’t wish protect them, keep safe people refuse get vaccinated choice?

I understand it’s 3% US population, example, that’s still ~9,943,478 people. 22,800 cases today. 10,500 2 weeks ago. soaring,they're defo going up! recent study argued this.

Could save you, could kill (blood clots)
May reduce transmission, may not
may need boosters, may not
= unknown experiment.
 Manufacturers know, neither dies 'the science' There’s evidence right boosters needed time vaccines, probably won’t get concrete info subject till least Fall. I've talked many Cubans exile. trust whatever stats authoritarian government puts out. Hahahaha  blood clots rare. I'm afraid not, empatically not. article discussing whether *second* shot needed case previously infected individuals. accepted wisdom amongst dealing problem, know bit 'basic science', previously infected people get least one vaccination. second shot question. spare onerous, back breaking task taking 7 minutes read article actually learning something present following quote covers PART debate article about: also point **some people become infected SARS-CoV-2 mount relatively weak immune response**. response especially common people don’t develop COVID-19 symptoms. “There’s huge range antibody generation durability individuals,” notes Wherry. “Making decisions based previous PCR-confirmed infections might miss people.”

Perhaps basic basic science developing habit forming conclusions absence evidence. Look speak. Without *very* basic habit nobody claim understand anything concerning science, 'basic' otherwise. world doesn' necessarily act way expect, certainly desn't act way want. said locked end year? like car deaths, topic here? born south you. Augsburg Bavaria, Germany.  Freedom liberty end choices make directly harm freedom liberty others. Good luck you. Yeah country full dipshits refuse vax something fuckin idiot told facebook. ranking cuba edge states, states 37 cuba 39. tried reading? knew majority state wearing masks keeping 6 feet part would cause many Covid-19 hospitalizations? /s No. vaccine many things others. vaccines lack called sterilizing immunity. vaccines conditions provide all, do. depend number contextual things. 

That say, get Corona Virus reduced chances develop symptons call Covid19. get virus, lacks type immunity transmit others. 

We known hope thataybe would work better alas, vaccines, maybe future reformulations vaccines. Don’t get wrong, I’m adults getting vaccinated got shot first chance had. don’t think lockdown end year due risk much smaller risks already took pre pandemic (since unfortunately cannot make driving safer covid kids). I’m also fully favor masks places children must frequent, everywhere else people able chose saying wear masks distance forever order protect extremely low % population? Sorry, can't buy that. take account fact nobody goes fucking bankrupt receiving life-saving medical care Cuba? mean can’t seem even get people mask get vaccine. Seems like simple ask, yet we’ve got 18 month, ongoing debate it. So, looks like it’s stay 

Masks stay. I’m flying I’m without one this. simply don’t want breath everyone else’s shit.  Get widely available vaccine. Otherwise, sucks them. said wake get fabled 500 million out.

Pretty sure ""lost"" debate revealed can't actually read. Internally yes, link outside world incredibly strict. example, seen girlfriend (who lives Melbourne) 14 months. hurt, numbers huge relative dosages given - 2.5 million (1.5M AZ, 1M Pfizer) almost 50 million, 5% we'll received end week.

It helps, sure. vaccine deliveries coming rapidly pace vaccination accelerating quickly.

Canada hedged bets made deals multiple vaccine providers. couple work (the Johnson &amp; Johnson one particular) overall, going much supply demand long. doubt give shit people HIV. wear mask distance like everyone still got children fellow citizens cannot take it.

ZzzzZZzz that's basic math. half population vaccinated, half still get sick, that's Delta spreading.

It legitimately good question, already answer. say “we’ll never this,” mean you’re accepting defeat convinced wearing masks lockdowns/ social restrictions forever? instituted dozens laws regulations reduce injuries necessary activity (driving). 

This support case lack protections something else. Regarding vaccinations, stop speed limits stop lights? No, protections well. Adults getting vaccinated less burden getting driver's license, makes big difference. getting downvoted know reddit loves apologists leftist totalitarian governments. romantization Cube absurd.  ""they're communists must lying"" dog shit propaganda buddy. really way nail exactly many. I's like everybody gets tested weekly basis, especially asymptomatic, especially early first wave real reliable test. However think common sense consider 33m confirmed infections captures positive tests must LOT positives there. don’t think that’s issue, we’ve lot freedom last 16 months, comparably. part people accepted restricted movement favour fewer, less severe outbreaks. right point strategy abandoned, that’s something hasn’t really discussed all.  Thanks! Sorry, lost debate posted US shipping donated vaccines asking woken do.  Pretty spot 👏🏻  Side note: sub getting brigaded morons something? Seems like comments getting downvoted. people get vaccinated, share make up. mean they're working, that's math

If 100 percent population vaccinated, 100 percent cases deaths vaccinated people. Rubbish didn’t problem. They’re constant threat sudden lockdown they’re allowed leave country. plans make taken away whim. Whole industries sword constantly dangling head.

They different problem world, still urgently addressed. get double length crisis compared rest western world. Eliminating diseases took time (decades, months).

A lot decades spent getting feedback vaccine effectiveness improving them. measles initially single dose, found three doses lifetime immunity really strong. may take decades we've got much faster vaccine development, there's lot room improvement now.

Eradication (worldwide dropping infections entirely zero) like smallpox difficult, since may difficult-to-reach animal reservoirs. original bat reservoir (with wuhan strain) really matter; eliminate delta whatever next-gen strain rest never gain foothold. Mink farms present significant problem. 1800s called. want epidemics back. know someone ""mild"" case ended diagnosed brain damage 6 months later.

Yea, I've vaxed months now. Look words used. Words like ""may,"" ""could.""

There possibility need boosters. possibility will. media comes sides, general public used hearing something big ""maybe,"" expect answers, NOW, possibilities, ANSWERS.

I'm...in Bangkok. yes, get saying. Thailand, Sinovac AstraZeneca available now. Sinopharm Sputnik coming July. Moderna Novavax, maybe October. I'm advising clients (I Covid risk mitigation businesses) friends hold July. point taking inferior product better one coming soon.

And yes, Sinovac prevent death, time fails, people downline put risk, especially countries vaccine rolled yet. Ultimately, J&amp;J gave immune system information Pfizer gave mine. probably going find differences minimal, exist all. not, we’ll know soon too.  live poorest city US. Places like Mississippi poor many reasons lack heathcare helping. 

Come visit us think heatlhcare good economy,

Congratulations living rich area deal poverty. vast majority infections UK partially vaccinated people vaccinated; cases kind irrelevant since inevitably decrease finally cover largest spreader group, young adults, got vaccine access recently. pretty much every post sub days it, plenty info comments / articles  They’ve got told NHS “Vaccines don’t stop transmission”

So...is gonna enough misinformation/doomsday/neurotic people *finally* accept reality? got two shots don’t need third? Hundreds millions people gotten virus… billions not. never got it. Neither I. Don’t see what’s hard understand that. Yep. Intelligent countries (Signapore example) already recognized Covid endemic. really vaccinate country reopen international travel, likely appropriate restrictions (entrants need vaccinated). Otherwise, many years countries willing for? cost? Australia's border policies borderline inhumane, preventing citizens seeing family members countries international workers/students starting jobs/education. Covid likely never go away. longer goes for, less likely international community seek invest country. I’m sorry, that’s sounds rough. Glad he’s okay. 

I personally miserable week (fever, chills, works) second Pfizer shot. would again. sure beats getting Covid, even one recovers, long term effects scare way more. Depends vaccination rate around you, anyway. started going gym without mask CDC dropped guidance, never felt uncomfortable, south may think twice (even though technically matter since I'm vaccinated suppose).  Delta variant. UK adopted months-long delay vaccine jabs 1 2 turned vaccine 1 enough protect Delta. young people, covid actually less deadly flu... say certainty, yet young people don’t need vaccine, already anti bodies, take vaccine die blood clots. feel like maybe chances covid better vaccine

There risks, say certainty vaccine better certain individuals good would agreed longer spacing doses get people partially vaxxed right approach months ago, Delta variant making doses pretty much mandatory protection I'm sure. odds someone 60 pandemic. think overly cautious. fully vaccinated, LOT protection Delta variant. get it, vaccine ensures likely get mild symptoms.  you’re healthy enough you’re thinking jiu jitsu, you’re high risk. one rare breakthrough cases, you’ll likely experience bad cold worst. 

Personally, place you’re considering requiring vaccination participate, would enough me. It’s true, I’ve comments asking question removed covid science subs I’ve also temporarily banned. I’ve told it’s “on topic” want sciencey explanation natural immunity vs. vaccine. thank effort, see one line 2019 results. That’s good hear. jabs Pfizer. someone explain true people told wear masks vaccinated areas variant virus spreads across globe again. Sounds like boldface bullshit me. Lets transition full helmets oxygen tanks already, apparently nobody needs breathing anyone ever again. It’s fucking “don’t bring problem, bring solution” mentality. work corporate consulting people fight vaguely suggest process/strategy needs improved barely touched 5 years ago. I’ve found boomer-ish mindset, driven people able sleepwalk entire careers based perception opposed actual value.  AZ like JJ?  Please somebody explain me…I gotten lot vaccines since child understand they’re like one done protected life basically…I’m talking two round vaccine(a) mean like even polio vaccine two shots understanding don’t get another one ever. 

Now w flu shots never get bc they’re vaccines it’s like different shot every year understand bc flu always changing would never call flu vaccine. Isn’t COVID vaccine thing like flu shot? call something vaccine doesn’t protect life? I’m anyway shape form anti vaccines movements stupid af they’re dangerous I’m pro get shot that’s vaccine couple months years worth protection. 

I would feel comfortable getting COVID vaccine figure make last long vaccines said play part mask public go outside events don’t want get vaccine yet doesn’t mean ppl suffer One step away ""those people."" mean ""people like you"" ? Dutch already send hundreds thousands doses countries kingdom (as expected, countries kingdom help eachother, independent countries), pretty big waves get vaccines anywhere else. islands access enough vaccines cover entire adult population couple months now.

They also already send hundreds thousands doses Surinam, former colony that's completely independent. also huge wave now, COVAX deliveries went slow. Netherlands decided send enough vaccines July cover entire adult population (750,000 doses).

Also, said still receive 12 million Moderna doses 2021. they'll need maximum 3 million doses coming months population, remaining 9 million 2021 Moderna deliveries donated. probably count millions Pfizer, Janssen, AstraZeneca potentially Sanofi (no results yet) CureVac (probably low efficacy) doses. people there's sussinct way describe situation clear much world still worry. convenient term use think people realize virus literally eradicated. got mine night discontinued - vaccine 6pm. News coming out. later announced they’re pausing it. may lives similar way flu we’ll need annual semi annual boosters, starts evolve lots variants?  Yes, even safety precautions still unfortunately hundreds children dying every year car accidents. unfortunately reality hundreds millions people point SV SP vaccines available much easily , much cheaper, much earlier MD PF vaccines, still prevent hospitalization death 99 percent time.

Also, many non-western countries, remainder 88 percent world, simply access MD PF vaccines, US hoarded - understandably , since world's no. 1 COVID nation 6 months back.

When poor, choose. wait american made limo. take media adverts much better . really care either, since East Asia , even 10 percent kind infection rates west, many countries China Vietnam Singapore near zero COVID cases. Probably, speaking certainty future brand new things silly. would extremely unexpected anything point, sailing unknown waters.

Rules (especially rapidly evolving situation) going make sense everyone, everywhere, every time. we're trying get entire country pull direction. I've pretty disappointed last 16 months inability make trivial personal sacrifices. Yeah two doses going tricky, least one dose seems doable though. hard say true.. Yesterday listening radio news saying protection may last less year. Finally malls useful something. limited data read, killed. ends small number them, easily replaced, potential mechanism arm soreness. agree. I'd really like comparison info here. bad COVID kindergarten age kids? comparable chicken pox back vaccine? Chicken pox could kill, long term effects (I know several people 40 shingles), yet one homeschooled children keep getting chicken pox.

I know families suffered COVID kids 10 almost symptoms. want anecdotal evidence considering things. USA recently announced “vaccinated purpose travel” 2 doses “any approved vaccine” 1 dose J&amp;J, includes AstraZeneca.

The fear USA letting people astra Zeneca came announcement Bruce Springsteen show, government. show rescinded statement favour USA guidelines days later, rumour mill persistent. free public healthcare countries. compensation suffering caused induced take something. I'm shitting south. I'm shitting lower standard education here.

[CDC's according site vaccinated folks participate normal activities without mask, I'm sure effectively cuddling strangers 3-4x week without mask especially new contagious variant going around. Now, [WHO telling vaccinated folks mask 

I'm thinking risk postpone joining martial arts activities months. go wear mask? overly cautious vaccinated individual? Delta starting spread US, come.   could catch symptoms, give kid mild symptoms.

That…doesn’t seem like much concern. sure read New York accent head. Plus effective. countries relied heavily china seeing spikes much worse countries used pfizer/moderna/jj/az.

Vaccine hesitancy less problem people thought. Average deaths 20 day (lower France Germany), hospital admissions 200 day. 

These numbers tracking far lower previous waves, getting large bursts infections areas, especially student cities, translating large numbers hospitalised.

It would certainly make room uninfected people get 2nd dose also making people infected less hesistant get 1st shot instead 2.

Oh no! work overnight even thought this! appreciate brought up, I'm gonna look now. Vaxxed longer wear masks J&amp;J one similar mRNA ones one dose blood clots would popular finished testing 2-dose regime it.

Novavax efficacy that's around 95% range like mRNA ones, also 2 doses. Unfortunately, can't find paper read time, doctors compared antibody counts vaccinated one mRNA vaccines active covid infections post infections. groups showed antibodies, vaccinated showed highest antibody counts lower variance counts. groups showed lower counts higher variance. implication unvaxed group may weaker immunity variation level immunity. caught virus still get one vaccines.

If find paper I'll post it, I'm pretty sure lost browser history.  agree. hundred thousand cost hospital stay crazy. private room due covid, iv meds, 12 days oxygen insane.

Honestly sheer amount gofundme drives occur within first month drive vaccination centers.  cover small portion people vaccinated still get (plus people can't get vaccinated due age valid medical reasons)

Edit: I'm saying support idea denying medical care leaving punitive health bill, there's easy solution problem. work pharma. Clinical trials take ten years. quick?

1. Funding. 
Funding cycles usually happen results gathered phase trial. Starting lab (phase 1) level. take years. Obviously funding issue here.

2. Due above, phases often completed reviewed, funded, designed, recruited undertaken. Obviously takes years. able undertaken concurrently. Phase 2 still running phase 3 was. make phase 2 rushed? No. exact process, run time phase 3.

3. Notified bodies (FDA, MHRA etc) worked rolling review system. Usually trials would need completed reviewed etc compiled report submission document. would reviewed notified body. Due urgency, notified bodies reviewed stage completed. need wait everything completed. rushed? every bit data reviewed, would traditional format done simultaneously. always happen? Money resources. vaccines obviously prioritzed.

This able complete trials vaccines much quicker previously done.

Any questions, please ask. NY Times interviewed doctor suggested ""two three"" rule, even vaccinated folks.

The rule is:

* Outdoors
* Socially Distant
* Wearing mask

Choose two three things, good go.

That's rule I've following given peace mind. keep mask pocket go walk park, go somewhere, stop talk somebody, put mask on. Everybody get paid, that's whole nother story. nerve ask us afraid virus low death rate. Completely oblivious fact slowing spread lowered death rate tremendously. I'm thinking fall unpleasant. least South though think numbers stay relatively low we're outside, last summer. true peer review magical. many things take word.

The real reason believe Pfizer data lying would eventually found fuck stock price, incentive it. rumblings Thailand mix match. bet AstraZeneca Sinovac, looking salvage really unfortunate strategy. Sputnik coming soon, Moderna October. we’re already gonna lose people south / rural areas high resistance vaccines.

Okay...that leaves fewer Trump voters fewer anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-looking-out-for-each-other morons. Yep would thought. 95% 100% We're sure. thought they'll similarly effective, published studies/results mixing different mRNA vaccines yet. UK running trial this, hopefully they'll publish interim results soon. No. Delta Variant sure. looks really good variants. kinda do: Signed vaccine literally first day available demo worn mask since became longer required. make sense anymore. original CoronaVirus shaped like sphere. variant shaped like triangle. Unless kids pre-existing medical condition, virtually zero chance getting severe form Covid-19. They'll likely asymptomatic. older people family vaccinated protected, would worry?

I'm genuinely asking :-)  Okay first France unfair Germany WWI. war Guilt Clause put entire blame Germany. Problem Germany start WWI. Austria Hungary did. reason France wanted take revenge humiliating defeat Franco-Prussian War ended 1871. WWI Germany took 3 million Deutschmarks loaf bread. Add comes Adolph Hitler.

I'd rather vax kids take chances that, take chances delta variant. info variant kids can’t vaccinated yet - worse Alpha? exactly case family. Even though fully vaccinated, kept tabs rest world. Delta causes countries go back lockdown, still use masks public try limit exposure much possible. Like others said thread, unlikely people listen public health orders go back effect. unfortunately means variants could result dense spread Gottlieb speaks of. know many want believe vaccines enough. may help us today, let Delta spread unchecked. unfortunate sad anti-vaxx others refuse public health orders keep pandemic ending. people get vaccinated medically cleared also wear masks get tested. actually think uncontrolled soead best way reach herd immunity scammer docs YouTube told Precisely. ""if vaccinated people transmit delta variant."" 

Pretty sure tbh. .93  Lot panic inducing posters lately conveniently leave part Medicare &amp; medicaid Bullshit. Crazy thought, maybe let's adopt policies explicitly designed increase suffering? Healthcare stop human right someone disagrees you. think saying data supports range scenarios, depending data sets included. would 1:8 best case scenario, 2:1 worst case scenario, 2:3 estimate.

I can't make got 2:1 ratio though. bit weird throw without making reference table something. go 2:3 estimate explicitly though. peer reviewed paper think they're making stuff up. look numbers like. page 4.

Be warned though, one decisions made think they'll need defend they're using dutch estimate 700 side effects per 100k vaccinations, rather EU average. ways makes sense, could reasonably expect average brought reporting, estimate line CDC estimates, something keep mind.

Well course, think vaccinating 100,000 people save 2 people cost/benefit ratio vaccine terrible.
But that's crazy number. 

A real life number:

Austria 646,243 cases 10,471 deaths. That's 1,620 per 100,000 cases.
source: (official gov website) need legislation allow insurance companies deny claims catch covid refused get vaccinated. want subsidize stupidity. There’s way say wasn’t.

Cautiously optimistic, let's wait approval foreign health bodies (EMA, whatever country bodies clearly FDA touching it). Personally, kids think would comfortable point, everything know virus now, treat young kids without otherwise health concerns vaccinated adults. odds severe lasting symptoms low, lower typical seasonal flus. 2009 even flu pandemic several times deadlier young children COVID time frame nobody knew taking much precautions still rare get severely ill.

Of course make argument waiting another months vaccine approved safer, think also real risks lack close social contact may also profound young children.  Go world!  Whoa….

That panic inducing incredibly misleading, given vaccines still 88% effective literally symptoms, 96% effective hospitalization, even protective death.

I’ll give usual reminder here: *reductions risk*, hospitalization rate 5% (it strongly age dependent, reasonable best estimate), 0.2% now. mortality rate around 1/10th that, probably around 0.02% vaccinated (on average; again, really depends age). comparable risks unquestioningly accept order live way want live.

Real world infection data tell true answer. India's health ministry saying variant transmissible. unvaccinated affect vaccinated. get sick take hospital beds. 

Imagine heart attack told “Sorry, beds.” Need kidney transplant? Got shot? Sorry, beds…etc. beds unvaccinated taken them.

These people don’t understand actions butterfly effect…that connected choices make affects people. can't kid play playgrounds crowded? Lol. delayed enough vaccines made stop deaths seen countries.

The real problem shithouse govt decided go cheap vaccine purchase went one. good bot look study reference, 4,460 infected vaccinated people includes people moment get vaccinated, ignoring fact takes weeks build immunity. 4,405 infections (98.7% them) first 28 days 1st dose (i.e. 2nd dose taken effect). applies deaths, 7 9 vaccinated group happened 2nd dose would effect.

Further, given extremely limited time frame studies reference (4-6 weeks), NNTV obviously quite high attack rate 2-month period going relatively low. even admit Israeli field study, observation period six weeks, U.S. regulatory studies four six weeks, period commonly assumed sufficient see clinical effect vaccine, would also time frame within someone infected initially would fall ill perhaps die. observation period longer, clinical effect size might increased, i.e., NNTV could become lower and, consequently, ratio benefit harm could increased favor vaccines.

But we've seen uncontained spread COVID looks like, areas saw 50-70% attack rates 0.3-0.5% population dying (and likely top end infectious variants). Trying argue need vaccinate 16K people save 1 life light asinine. 

Taking lower two (0.3% Population Fatality Rate) NYC saw, vaccine that's 95% effective preventing death, would Absolute Risk Reduction 0.285% matched vaccinated unvaccinated groups. NNTV inverse ARR, would 1/0.285% ~350 vaccinations save life, 45x lower number paper uses. also means 285 lives saved per 100K vaccinations. According article, mutation reduces ACE2 affinity, hurts ability spread Lying ass. vomiting stuff read online... 

Nah, believe not, true.

Know someone part it. fucking hate anti-vaxxers too, weaponizing America's grotesque healthcare system like stupid idea many reasons. Healthcare human right, even stupid people. Deadly transmissible. 

That’s really generally virus mutations work science. Washington State seems concerned [gamma (formerly known gamma variant local public health officials worried. That’s contrast Mountain West many Southern states, delta variant — transmissible compared alpha much 60% — driving cases putting pressure everyone concerned delta going deaths hospitalizations, seeing Washington, seeing breakthrough cases proportionately, hospitalizations gamma variant,” Lindquist said. sorry comment deleted, thought offensive

nonetheless I've read profile, true politicians required tell truth companies ways get around too

for starters amount pay small may choose pay it, think famous case company (I'm thinking Nestle I'm sure) got sued Europe complied also got sued Asia reason fought it

for company matter numbers sometimes simple expect

besides case vaccines companies require people sign agreements make liable side effects such, country sign order get vaccinated: says legal action taken government company made megacorp battling third world court issue all

so essence say right get fine print actual numbers think actions might defy logic Man remember years back Cali needed raise taxes pretty much every year pay government payroll alone.
Now seem rolling dough.
Hopefully save future expenses  citizens highly suspicious vaccine want it. Shame Sputnik seems highly effective strategy using two different adenovirus vectors two doses looks smart. don’t see anyone said refuse treatment. Make pay de-prioritize treatment though. alcoholic needs liver, receive medical treatment don’t actually quit drinking. much different that. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Based fact, good reason *not* delay vaccination concerns regarding myocarditis pericarditis.

Puppet master (s) pulling strings Yeah well mask mandate gone many students going wild cafe’s also Portugal. ticking time bomb… came looking TLDR, I’m mildly disappointed. Downstate Illinois might well South. think kind arguing disadvantage admitting killing animals fun. reason gun/hunting nuts usually conservative idiots mere coincidence. Retail. Well understand you’re coming from. God got customer service 25 years ago. hated it. assholes made bail. Yeah know there's someone cite study vaccine disease somewhere somehow effective real disease think there's paper declare true covid all. Heck, limited time struggle prove vaccines effective _at all_. fuck tries claim even one released vaccines effective virus itself? humans weren’t biologically programmed social creatures (which understand rather foreign concept introverted, basement dwelling redditors) problem idiots children. populations interact. live ""on land"", separate geographic regions. Palestinians live WB PA government, Gaza Hamas. go Israel, Israelis cannot go Palestinian cities areas A/B/Gaza. subset population interact Israelis 100k Palestinians work Israel proper (and permits so), vaccinated long time ago Israel. practice new COVID cases Israel tracked back Israelis returning abroad, Palestinians. *centuries tools make sure come pass. people want pretend virus issue take ill—then them. tired dealing people live alternative reality. age knowledge—ignorance choice. Um, last year's rioting covid... convince them, people get vaccinated they're told they'll responsible pay treatment. There's pattern often seen. effect them, care. them, sudden becomes issue.  Nah, wrong. said private insurance, government.  use gloves work. hardly anyplace wash hands see people wipe nose touch door handles. I'm fully vaccinated + 2 weeks, whats consensus around kids immunocompromised people potential exposure?

I also wonder small percentage fails catch asymptomatic id never know potentially spreader.  phrase “hunker down” mentioned article. spreading misinformation? ones need hear read it, wouldn’t. lumbar pain worst part, actually still extent. sister person I've heard symptom, hope better. poor support yacht! would make feel better? aren’t worried immunization getting sick won’t last, it’s really vaccine dead?  thank working them! S.A.M.E. Glad someone else questioning efficacy results here. think emphasis needs ""you"".  seems end game this. Eventually you’d get combined Flu/COVID jab. course. vaccines sword, shield. also 100% efficacy (efficacy prevention symptom).

That said, average vaccinated person spread virus far far fewer people would vaccinated (lower viral load, fewer symptoms like coughing sneezing, much faster recovery). individually may much good guy gave unvaccinated grandmother, population level crushing virus. Meanwhile, vaccinated individuals protected severe illness death Here's step-by-step:

1. Scroll up
2. Read edit
3. Feel embarrassed foolish
4. Move goalposts MIS-C right believe reported children. It’s happening several months. believe text means 146 children diagnosed 103 went ICU. don’t believe high rate diagnosis outside hospitalization. don’t know think article proves? Please tell you’re joking. Every single healthcare issue already you. government US doesn’t pay healthcare bill. insurance do. It’s already vaccinated not. check back weeks see delta doing. how's sound.

my prediction: goes way rest scary variants went.....aka nothing   Dense population catching it? I'm month due second shot. think ill get now.. dead ""Dealt force"", want push policies need first person knocking doors force people like backwoods bubba get shot.  Lol I’m Cancun husband honeymoon say painless. Thankfully
Our resort site testing (since US requires negative tests return) people escape Mexico return like isn’t pandemic... issue need vaccinate prevent means vaccinating countries wave sending support near peak wave. also need segment populations, it’s far better prevention standpoint achieve pseudo-herd immunity one area 20% coverage across multiple areas. 

It’s hard gain public support type plan though. Well, number one. Take advantage another week half. introvert could sure shit leave two weeks ease (aside pup walks)

And proud yourself. anyone try better person dwell shitty trash used be?

You're better week ago. That's big accomplishment!

Both parents unvaccinated couple weeks ago mother got vax one Saturday (last, two days ago) dad got J&amp;J Monday.

My dad going get one mom scared. Proud both. I'm harping waiting. badgered get them.

Don't beat up, overcame. Good job. doesn’t one still prevent hospitalizations? talking USA? health care wrong. hearing guys getting government pay healthcare. pay use insurance. sign single payer healthcare? willfully vaccinated? May want edit that. lunch Montreal's central station group came back CES Vegas, got sick. sister hit worst, brutal lumbar pain, like writhing pain crying. followed 2 months shingles....

Get damn shot people. going honest you. I'm biology student graduate undergrad December. gotten vaccinated yet ""what if"" back mind. bf pushing get one well. can't tell everyone, including parents, listen science I'm not. nagging anxiety. get one problem one driver house (injured foot involved) lot shit going know I'll able actually get done. want though make push get mistrust drug testing US.

I'll take chances lol.

You continue live fear. thanks it’s 30 age group that’s least vaccinated right + oxygen overwhelmed, could benefited assistance. They’re little asterisk next every otherwise justified expression complete indifference toward lives unvaccinated. happened well.

WHO delta, ""to lethal it’s efficient way transmits humans eventually find vulnerable individuals become severely ill, hospitalized potentially die."" CDC described ""hyper-transmissible.""

Studies cited saying delta 60% transmissible alpha.

I heard CDC says virus inherently deadlier outside contagiousness, Dr. Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health Providence, said delta variant ""is far contagious variant seen throughout entire pandemic. also appears little bit deadly people get infected.""

No idea 10x came from. Perhaps reference India's delta wave much deadly first due spread. Covid also dangerous demographic, fact less flu.  bad policy happens…….. Anecdotal - however, year ago April antibody test work, showed high antibody levels (no positive test symptoms).

Lots disenfranchised people. Man, imagine sick immune response that. Still worth it, look forward recovery day. They've said Covid past protect getting again. Advise people get vaccination. Let us hope nastier variant appear, one overcome vaccines. might now, rest year spawn better, virulent variant. better place sprawling American South? 

The good news even though children young adults getting sick UK, hospital admissions lower expected. 

Additionally, (and read this) spread seems slowing. entirely possible getting boxed vaccinated individuals. 

That may help us parts Florida. extremely low vaccination rates counties enough stem tide. genuine point surviving AML, suffer?. Actually response parents care. Interesting well thought reply. However scientists pointing (on twitter) reinfection studies showing higher breakthrough delta, vaccine studies are. knows, think discount natural immunity far. one fan find culture, wish could go without pandemic mutations.

*Find gonna fuck around* :( come crying end breakthrough case losing sense smell. Confirmed antibodies 3 months first.

First, chest pain, high fever, sweating despite 104f fever, cough, cough deep lungs, could sleep stomach. Fever unrelenting 5 days, 10 minutes late reloading anti-inflammatories, fever went up. Blood pressure 160-170/110-120 vs normal 140/80. felt like needed cough lung nothing. could hardly make bathroom wrecked.

Second, thought food poisoning. Day 4 exposure, got sore stomach migrated gastrointestinal attack, passing pure bile. Sat toilet couch doubled pain.
After 3 days, called Dr, again, assumed good poisoning sushi, advised get covid test right away, hospital worked seen big uptick gastro covid, went sure enough, positive. 2 tests confirm. I'd before, wanted make sure false positive.

Both cases 100% different, nothing either.

Putin: Well, shit... definitely fucked vaccine side things. per capita, US death rate 50 times australian one. trade off. Live lockdowns live deaths.  Basically everyone wants UK US, certainly every demographic stands high risk death hospitalization. point level risk accept, nobody willing talk level is. never however zero, may even slightly higher regular pre-2020 flu season, resume living life. life lived soly avoidance death even life worth living view.

I'm sick shit, people need get fucking vacinated. couldn’t agree more. I’m vaxxed, I’m also bit nervous-nelly pessimistic-patty. Every time hear variants, jump worst conclusion.

Pressure provide good working conditions? exist employees never leave. Upward pressure wages due workers wide choice employers could leave work for? Nope, they're going leave.

And even hurt business owners long term, since wealthier society one people spend more, also pressure innovate fewer workers less workers trapped cheap - worker productivity takes hit.

One introduce risk death due lack healthcare consequence leaving job, surprise, people become risk averse.

Big business give two shits economics though, control government enrich regardless productivity is, whether innovation actually happening. Source? one refusing them. We're waiting register. 24 unvaccinated guests infected, huh?

There's assumption current safety net always, might well expand covers people used cover. know, like nations.

The problem lack political necessary.  I've wearing mask public always even getting vaccinated.

Just worried washing clothes laundromat shaking stuff there. last sentence, talking virus antivaxers children? supply issue personnel issue, supply increased even (Now countries hitting demand limits), resolve itself. delta deaths UK, 40% unvaccinated people. 17% one vaccine dose 43% two.

Source this? I’ll use N95 fly rest life. Planes gross necessary.  got first one couple days ago too....I’m terrible procrastinator. walking thru Walmart like welp I’d idiot waltz ask vaccine. did! It’s way premature strategy best. We’ll likely better idea 5-10 years now. saying get vax get vax maybe information help put mind Exactly. highly doubt cases world’s largest slums accurately counted. I’m sure people live could gone lockdown quarantined. said unvaccinated people greater risk ever even though cases astronomically higher winter.

It's absolutely nonsensical, hysterical thing say.  Epsilon won’t necessarily worse delta. beauty data needs happen know happened past.

You clearly want wear mask, added precaution help safer. Sure cloth mask may nice hurt wear better mask N95 mask. masters subject yea general idea I'm talking about. completely wrong, bud. see one single payer health care system country came vaccine. They’re seriously trusting efficacy results put Cuban government It’s reinstating mandates unlikely, even reinstated adherence would low. No, like that! Time already to,d better strategy is.

One smart friend insists unethical use vaccine ""created stem cells"" - even though cells harvested 40 years ago cells used testing 1000s generations removed original tissue. different mind babies aborted directly injected vials. apparently thinks people unnecessarily suffering dying *today* okay. also watches podcasts saying vaccine dangerous, sent articles veterinary virologist trying suggest risk jab, pseudoscience podcasts he's listening reiterate confirmation bias.

The rejection expertise embrace conspiratorial nonsense problem COVID underscored, going away. Yeah knew this. sarcastic first post. Many PCR tests check different sequences COVID19 genome. variant may cause one sequences fail heard variants totally escaping PCR detection yet. possible theory mutations eventually evade current PCR detection think we're yet.

Don't get wrong. Vaccines work, unvaccinated right now, still definitely try best secure vaccination appointment soon possible. However, problem lies CDC's guidance, may longer adequate light new information. pandemic constantly changing situation, all.

Wonder whether CDC revert back mask recommendation people regardless vaccination status (as recently done, I'm aware two organizations necessarily agree). used think would almost certain, I'm entirely sure. Even do, doubt many states, even ""stricter"" ones New York California, would willing reimplement mask mandates. *Definitely* Florida, Texas, etc. social end here, all. still good thing?

Thats evolved cellular memory response B cells, time active antibody response decomposes, long-term memory cells ready rapidly expand re-produce effective neutralizing antibodies infected-cell killing t-cells shen virus encountered again. people theorizing might need boosters sometime near future, slow drop serum antibody levels could allow someone temporarily infected again.

We're politically left US, much like Canada.

However New Zealand like Mexico, people come ship home commit crimes EU citizens also EU residents?

Either way, neither scenarios seems far fetched imo:

EU citizen lives Britain. S/he received Covishield AZ vaccine UK. S/he returns home EU (for whatever family/work/etc reasons) finds him/herself without green pass.

Person B India. S/he received Covishield AZ vaccine back home, later moves EU (becoming EU resident) work.

Its important note lifespan vaccines. protect life. fact,, even know long protected [We don’t know long protection lasts vaccinated. know COVID-19 caused serious illness death lot people. get COVID-19, also risk giving loved ones may get sick. Getting COVID-19 vaccine safer one answer:

[The immunity conveyed vaccine varies. For vaccines, like polio vaccines, immunity can last lifetime, while for other vaccines, like influenza, vaccines are needed 100 years ago people probably thought would fizzle out. Last year people thought would fizzle out. vaccine thought would fizzle out...

All vaccine companies posted BILLION DOLLAR PROFITS quarter.Yeah, ok. new flu shot.... there's way someone making billions let something fizzle type capitalism. CMV, Deltas handed variants.  linked article literally says break infections.

There aren’t ton, breakthrough infections delta vanilla variants. Unvaccinated staff concern studies results, study also showed 10-fold decrease 6-months, logarithmic scale. Results same, presentation different confusing.

This actually like see, antibody levels need drop acute infection/vaccination. seeing would massive problem. important drop, baseline titer established, observe vaccination sometimes natural Covid infection.

All all, I'm pretty convinced Pfizer/Moderna vaccines highly protective least 2 years, *provided that* virus mutate it. unvaccinated population. remarkable amount people, whether measure per country worldwide, either refuse get vaccine lax masks social distancing huge population supply demand.

It restriction lifted like, 2 weeks ago? You’re technically right, it’s like absolute bare minimum. honestly seems like posturing new government (especially PM’s statements) show they’re taking things seriously, without actually imposing unpopular measures.

Sinopharm's efficacy data still promising, slow acting immunization long timeline vaccination means there's lot spread people celebrate early. 

What world really needed simple, one shot solution effective. Kind unexpectedly, one shot solution taken Moderna Pfizer. high first shot protection really helped rapidly lower cases countries access. don’t. anecdotal number unvaccinated people dropping dramatically every day, likely issue near future, especially approach herd immunity. point being?

It absolutely possible eradicate virus. even possible push low level life back 100% normal.

Yes, vaccinated people less likely infected (and infected, cant contagious) vaccinated people get infected less contagious unvaccinated infected people. vaccines 100% effective anything, they're highly effective relevant metrics. happened already? UK citizens go certain countries EU fully vaccinated. Oklahoma tf mean I’m spending every waking moment watching virus ravage countries. look Oklahoma’s trends graphs. Public health issues cost money report well. undervalue reporting refuse pay time. That's sustainable. they? one make minds? heard yesterday need six month booster. I'm getting feeling lately nobody actually knows they're doing. No, best protection anyone get waiting we've reached herd immunity virus can't exist meaningful way infect first place. 50% efficacy brazilian study 14 day gap doses, real world data shows 28 days goes close 64%. 

please send link lasting months, seen anyone talking it. happened already. pushing UK citizens banned entering EU. want to, fly Portugal today I'm fully vaccinated.    bullshit two vaccines mot need modified variants? getting info? understand mRna vaccines work? virus would completely different proteins variant get through. Stop reading non scientific sensational news thinking correct. It’s possible, way hell I’m taking risk enjoy breathing much. point wonder Novavax doses actually see use Canada, they'll exported countries. Either way, good world adding another 24 million doses production capacity Royalmount facility.  husband got yelled mom phone visited get vaccinated. Initially everything coming Europe, small batch AZ came India. US's demand started fall cliff, started getting doses US production facilities Pfizer/Moderna. Note donated doses anything like that, changed procurement doses paid US facilities rather European ones. key success government negotiating large contracts last summer, particular Moderna. Canada put lot faith abilities produce effective vaccine. planning isolating entire life? sounds like he's double vaxxed thats good protection ever going get.  J&amp;J didn’t second shot though? So, foundation floor joists injection site? Also variant real world situation vaccines ineffective. Dispite much meadia want be. Yeah mother camp of..it's flu..if get I'll fine I'm healthy.

Not worth trying anymore ""Booster shots every six months""

""Could last years""

*sweats capitalist* Canada (AZ MRNA). Canada also mixing MRNAs (so Pfizer moderna given first second doses indescriminantly.) got mine literally day pulled, lol. I'm butt jokes hear talk death via clots I'm 60 percent protected. go Mines second grade would lose place school permanently go ghetto school town live :/. hard. wish could virtual option vaccination. think that's much ask for. I'm teacher hated virtual, hybrid worst experience life would December save lives. Yup. feel well. beginning pandemic, people talking sacrificing elderly economy; people want sacrifice children. Wearing mask troublesome all, I'll keep around strangers (i.e. going grocery store, gym, work, etc.). Hopefully children get vaccine school year starts fall. Hopefully something unprecedentedly unpresidential never happens impact CDC guidance global health emergencies. tone deaf O'Toole cronies were, right least complaint government moving fast enough; versus questioning usefulness said vaccines. could fared far worse. DELTA takes off.

*When* DELTA takes off. FTFY.

This virus really seek out. Good luck ones anti-vaxx. met doctor pharmacist couple taking vaccine. US midwest. God save midwest south here. Hopefully variants come morons, could potentially set us back square one. always wondered usefulness border closures within EU. like EU country achieved anything remotely similar NZ Australia, strict border control measures effective keep country covid-free. 

Practically EU countries rampant outbreaks point growing *within* borders, what's point? Ah, variants? Well, border closures stopped either. 

At best send signal countries taking things ""seriously"" already happend month ago. Currently German residents allowed enter UK. 

She pushed EU countries attempt avoid headache closed borders EU neighbours. believe Pfizer high efficacy symptomatic infections (90%?). study shows efficacy transmission much lower (50% so). could indicate transmission asymptomatic infections cannot neglected. But, unfortunately, data study distinguish symptomatic/asymptomatic infections.

That said, data Singapore indicates transmission asymptomatic infections fully vaccinated people uncommon. know place refer us, J&amp;J’ers 💅🏼 you’re unvaccinated it’s matter you’ll contract covid Lmao 😂 small study Spain received quite lot press. Here: biggest financial rescue bankrupt country history.﻿ January 2019, Greece repaid 41.6 billion euros. scheduled debt payments beyond 2060. people elsewhere country looking us saying, ‘No thanks’ getting vaccinated, good,” said Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer Mercy Hospital Springfield

Narrator: people seeing symptoms UK, older fully vaccinated people younger unvaccinated people, current Delta variant, symptoms shifted around bit looking bit flu-like.

For older unvaccinated people, though, Delta considerably deadly (something like double dangerous) seen far.  repilcate response that's poor copy NZ response? anyone seen data Delta people unvaccinated Covid previously? got J&amp;J time unfortunately got covid month later. fever almost two weeks (I felt awful need go hospital anything, telemed) GF tested positive well (she Moderna months earlier) symptoms mild lasted day two. I'm guessing sleeping next every night reason got it.   around 10x flu. much contagious. It’s ok, it’s long pandemic. It’s expected us difficulty readjusting. allowed couple bad jokes interim period. Except hold it’s made available fully vaccinated. would likely November. wringing hands right now. little one registered kindergarten local school watching outbreaks schools Israel Delta variant looking homeschool year taking meager savings enroll private outdoor Kindergarten. I’d feel like failed allowed infected close getting vaccine. much concerning news coming effects brain feel ok it. stick another 6 months. Tough call either way parents. Yep, apparently still spread it. Bad title look highest 50 counties covid rates, MO half them.  Germany mixing AZ JJ people, want get second shot due rare side effects.

So vector first, mrna later think mixing vaccines Spain. also results countries stopped astrazeneca j&amp;j young people vaccinated mrna second shot. seems mixing gave even better protection one vaccine. eradicated years arent issue. Fella, read comment found ""regurgitated fact"" way, might reading comprehension issues. Everything wrote entirely accurate. AVAG! I’ve found it’s safe bet assume nature, uh, finds way… Haha! Yeah jk. got J&amp;J one week like hottest jab town “one done.” 5 days later blood clot scare happened it’s meme vaccine ever since.

But I’ve world without mask haven’t gotten sick yet, can’t complain  news Bangladesh keeps getting worse 🇧🇩 That's interesting angle actually. true too, people got upset *wanted* get vaccinated quickly possible. hands clean bro.

Oh no… /s thing vaxxed definitely count towards 2/3 rule. Vaxxed plus one three scenarios offers massive level protection beyond efficacy vaccine itself.  I’m mad didn’t get mine sooner. Got first shot days ago problem. care OP replying wear mask, point choosing I'm fully vaccinated state fully reopened (this week Oregon) make (quoting here) ""a selfish piece shit"".

As far ""the science says"" part reply, ""scientists"" saying vaccinated person wearing mask anything substantive reduce incidence Covid. So, wearing mask choice, one science says effect unvaccinated population. Honestly that’s probably best solution point. Get companies require vaccinations institute rule says anyone working federal government (contractors, etc) must fully vaccinated. give $200 everyone vaccinated August 1st. Sounds like cancer vaccine! extremely unlikely Canada follow UK’s delta trajectory one simple reason: UK opened indoor bars 18-30 yr old vaccinated.
Canada overall still quite far behind UK reopening majority young already 1 shot, 30%-50% protection symptomatic infection. Majority Adult population also fully vaccinated end July, populous province expected fully reopen What, what, WHAT!!! believe variant around since April, around time regular Delta

source? mother conservative husband COVID January, still get vaccinated. ""We antibodies."" 

Good luck, y'all.  teachers/staff district required vaccinated? still air? Lol I'm sure threat anything considering would likely financially fucked broken leg covid bills. nice part living corporately owned cesspit country They've already hit herd immunity: Israel R &lt; 1 zero restrictions. scenario made sense aggressively push vaccinating children, given rare side effects like myocarditis. reason changed delta variant higher R0, therefore higher herd immunity threshold. Still, even right unclear whether Israel actually new outbreak. entire thing might die days / weeks. every delta exists epsilon Lmao, well convinced bullshit. Thanks  nationwide herd immunity, sure, we’re still ways off. state 60% everyone one dose, 85% 65+ one dose, still steadily climbing. part. I’m worried us. 

My parent’s state, hand, still stuck 45% one dose. them, somewhat worried (although least parents vaccinated themselves). state already seeing flare ups supposedly caused delta variant—particularly under-vaccinated rural areas.

I fell behind work ate lot savings I've saved lot again, housing market nuts still can't afford anything decent. I'm talking people can't get vaccinated.

Oh wait, talking school shootings ? Haaaa True! here! couldn’t wait actually breathe outside home. Gospel immutable.

True! That's know appropriate keep gentiles slaves choose get vaccinated

For people underlying health issues, truly 'choice' get vaccinated. People severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) component mRNA vaccine, example.

Let's get torch-and-pitchfork *quite* yet. Picture #6 shows another public health concern nothing original argument. claim Israel vaccinate Palestinians ""if want pandemic end"". practice pandemic Israel nothing vaccinating Palestinians. studies mentioning natural immunity stronger mRNA vaccine one due impact B cells lower mRNA vaccines.   assume vaccinated people catching Delta capable spreading unvaccinated people?

Got shot around 4pm, came home, typical.
About 8pm, got tired went bed. Asleep quickly, around 2am woke worst sweats I've had, like, room 19c absolutely dripping sweat, still headache.

Just 4am woke again, headache, brain fog.

The first covid exposure train station, second Uber covid precautions, driver coughed sneezed times it. saying got first dose Pfizer second dose moderna binary-brained bumblefuck comes ""uhrr vaccines for?"" I'm right you. Call paranoid, think about:

1. Anyone already sent kids school prefers continue that.
2. Parents already group know knowingly bring sick kid(s) school/daycare. 
3. fall, already reports families ""pacts"" test kids covid symptoms, kids could continue play whatever highschool sports
4. Put things together sure testing kids. Kids completely asymptomatic, something mold sniffle, easy overlook
5. know governments reporting cases
6. know adults even mild covid-19 long haul health complications - assume kids
7. suspect kid's side effects reported. little, vocalize sudden longer endurance run one month ago? tell parents, tell pediatrician? happens, reported?
8. know people avoid covid-19 really working. Duh! Temp checks? part ""incubates spread 2 weeks symptoms shown"" understood? places successfully controlled either lying (Russia) strict (Thailand, NZ). yeah, world working - pretending people ""doing right thing"" time happened 1.5 years yet?
9. Covid-19 fatigue. people done right thing collectively, fucking sick tired bullshit. want go half things used to? Yes. vaccines, summer northern hemisphere, etc, getting huge veneer ""the way things were"" lull us false sense security. fall hits, kids vaccinated reasons started above?BAM!
10. covid mutates, likely see worst outcomes kids. really hope I'm wrong here, see already Brazil India.

So yeah, school district says online classes kid's age group. I'm lucky afford babysitter (it's financial struggle year, manage), probably pull home schooling necessary. would rather look back 5 years think, ""fuck me, overreacted COVID-19. Haha"" than, ""hey Timmy, I'm sorry almost teen scarred lungs propensity early heart disease given covid tired covid read writing wall sent back known petri dish called school global pandemic control."" *deep breath*

I feel like loon saying this. feel like crazy conspiracy theorist, awful. can't afford bill decide seek care delay care? First, US report excess mortality weekly basis. updated retroactively short deaths reported promptly everywhere. see report even omit 2020 data expectation calculation avoid pandemic normal surveyed nations report this. doubt even do.

Second, beef someone else mention countries all. Oh well. typo? mean ""impatiently""? manageable vaxed. unvaccinated coworker also caught felt like dying symptoms.

I mild cold. also eventually lost sense taste smell.

Been held home alone while. That's roughest. Doordash got taste anything. 

Looking forward getting back soon.  12 child affected. Gotcha, thanks reply. reassuring fascinating. got vaccinated required everyone sit minimum 15 minutes make sure allergic reactions occurred. concerned hypothetical reaction, make sure facility resources handle anaphylaxis (they almost definitely will). probably passing someone else could worse side effects, even none. got typical sore arm, plus chills night day one shot 1. sore arm shot 2. Moved arm entire 15 minute observation plus constantly afterwards still got sore arm days, results vary. protection recovering original strain also blunted new variant. people could reinfected estimated 6-8 months also get vaccinated, they'd likely able reinfected sooner this. Thanks agree. Even ONE wasted vaccine tragedy anyone wants it. even gives fuck redistribution expensive like stuck global pandemic isn’t?? Somehow, think thought allowed go mask-free would motivate people get vaccine. people won’t get vaccine people vehemently opposed masks, instead they’re maskless unvaccinated. That’s pretty brave admit public. Kudos honest sticking convictions. Glad you’re vaccinated. holy shit That's small minority they're worth mentioning context horrible people refuse get vaccinated good reason are. Haircuts entirely risk level, IMO it’s silly put dental work, important medical checkup. would trust dentist better following COVID protocols hair stylist. like needles, reminder lot lots lots hospital Covid unit going least one times there. forget going pissing tube inserted urethra whole time too. IIRC there’s evidence it’s deadly dangerous. vulnerable people already vaccinated, it’s mostly infecting younger, healthy people least likely hospitalized COVID.  Health personnel everywhere exhausted burnt out, know many right interested going country that's still throes pandemic.

Local personnel understand language customs, connections local communities, likely get people vaccinated. Mask definitely going back on. correct. green pass non-EU citizens well. many live within EU, vaccinated EU, get well.

Non-EU residents obtain well. request made, least Germany, vaccine entered yellow book, issue EU DCC. True. rest world extremely compliant restrictions, countries beat COVID protests anywhere else except US. common side effects observed pain, redness, swelling injection site fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever nausea. symptoms immune system going work responding sees pathogen. like mild flu day two.

A less common reaction allergy one components vaccine. rare cases lead hives, swelling, wheezing, anaphylaxis. asked wait 15 minutes post-injection monitored symptoms. clinics probably epinephrine treat reaction.

Most recently, advisories added myocarditis pericarditis (inflammation heart surrounding tissue) following vaccination. quite rare, order ~10 cases per million. know cause yet condition occur viral infection.

As long-term effects, first trial cohorts observed year signs concerning effects. There's really anything vaccine would accumulate linger. primary components lipids body processes time mRNA relatively fragile gets broken soon used make protein.

There's good write-up FAQ vaccines developed quickly without cutting corners.  guy’s beer goggles shirt tho Hi novavax trial zero anxiety side effects. boyfriend roomate also trial anxiety wasn’t seen us (we also withdrew study recently discovered got vaccine placebo). discounting persons symptoms contributing experiences. Great info. Thank you. Yes evidence going come trial lmao That's weird. Germany, get EU DCC irrespective nationality, EMA approved vaccines, including Covishield. got made non-EU parents got vaccinated Covishield. haven’t doctor
In 8-9 years don’t get sick, medicine type period 2 COVID shots. BC/BS plan kids(who also never sick - routine checkups). 

Im honestly scared think price increase year something almost never use. don’t know old I’m starting recognize trauma I’ve endured.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Show hospitals. Many anti vaccinated know horrors disease. think like cold think almost everyone allow eventually want end pandemic faster without waiting around specific brand. Saudia Arabia allows I'm pretty sure countries thought would strict vaccines Think Delta particular, R0 around 6, we'd need (1 - 1/6) population immunity (vaccinated ""naturally acquired""), around 83%. Note that, vaccines perfect, ""naturally acquired"" immunity likely even less Delta, might need vaccinate 90% population. And, course, kids can't vaccinated yet.

We're likely vaguely OK original coronavirus, R0 around 3, we'd need 66% immunity. Open link incognito _4/5 Cuban doctors prefer Cuba vaccine competing brands!_ European version specify Vaxzevria specifically either. SII's Covishield accepted well since vaccine, different brand.

I've got EU DCCs parents vaccinated Covishield. took longer obtain them, able get request.

I've also looked laws Austria Italy recently, since travel there. mentioned SII's Covishield breath sentence regular AstraZeneca shot.

If specified brand vaccine, would get even complex since vaccine certificates Germany, example, stating Vaxzevria issued Romania state AstraZeneca. 

So news might stemming misinterpretation rules, new interpretation. North American record vaccinations one clinic, think would possible.

Ontario gained 10% 2nd vaccination rate one week (76% first dose, 32% second dose), number vaccinations per day keeps going rate. 

It's even tomorrow opens adults eligible book second dose, rates nothing keep increasing long supply keeps coming like been.

Great news province! Children 0-11 choice say matter vaccinated right now. roughly 15% entire US population. former resident Springtucky, shocked well handled it. health department head said national TV job well, people hate him. I'm saying thrived, far better Midwest mid sized cities (and expecting far far worse knowing vibe there) dude retired proving statement true. think they'll even greater false sense security result. proof vaccines effective future variants either. Maybe natural less sensitive mutations.

But course could boost vaccine necessary. Interesting, still dev, interesting. Thank sharing. didn’t know living interesting times would confusing/exhausting. lot people side effects, nothing worry about! word numbers UK vaccine mix study coming? Seen several times end June🤔 I’ve edited comment reflect recent change linked. FDA dude talking disease? Vaccines, sure, makes sense. disease spread CDC's territory. Yes. also contradicts literally every bit information have. It’s click bait title, article mentions infected, vaccinated people could spread virus already new. also mention variant involved. really easy answer problem. No, it’s easy blame them, problem.

And honestly? took phizer vaccine faith people worked less due studies claims facts. less less trusting even hugely nudged money control. literally inclined due faith strong trust facts. 


This seriously needs stop. know needs change. need change. we're partisan living other's echo chambers

Yo, sides problem. I'm sick assigned blame compassionate/logical/hardworking/contributing member society. living echo chamber. partisan. Wouldn’t vaccines perfect example shield? It’s entirely defensive. Vaccines aren’t going attacking covid cases. understand, working person reluctant get vaccine. ask 2 week vacation get vaccine ride side effects. (It’s pretty bad) arm swollen leaving unable drive, hard even type computer. busy, recommend get vaccine vacation. mention financial costs community due community members sick (loss income due temporarily permanently stopping work, people taking leave work care sick family members, people become disabled develop chronic health conditions years later result COVID-19). Everything cost, we're part community. Depends:

- symptoms data ranges 30-60%
- hospitalizations pretty high - ~70-90%

But believe calculated separately either.  could obtain green pass PCR test. Here's university's page  First shot 9/2 second shot 9/23. I’m worried variants vaccination rates dismal part country. ONE wearing masks anymore. Thankfully friends family vaccinated work home I’m much. hopeful news all, Pfizer really ramping booster shot trials. eligible join go Friday. booster shot isn’t specific variant may get placebo determine booster needed I’ll get go back get ASAP. hopefully we’ll better data booster shots soon. perfect example civics must taught public schools. owe something societies live.

But expect them. lucky made *THAT* available. Quebec, appointment system based age groups specific spots per area. Booked appointment soon could (within 15 minutes appointment booking 2nd shot opening) still leaves waiting July 30th it. guys lucky. Canada problem, caused problems here, too, stopped Canada becoming #1 country world first doses, expected everyone wants vaccinated second dose end July.

We stretched time first second doses - slightly controversial time seems working. UK something similar. Good luck enter, since lot countries banned mandatory quarantine   next variant … one that. Etc. get really deadly one thanks southern cross Petri dish. longer lucky country then. second lockdown Sydney, otherwise lived mostly covid-free without restrictions past year.

Now, government sort vaccination program, lockdown again.. ***could*** seems like EU green pass sinking deeply politics. AFAIK Sinovac Sputnik-vaccinated people Hungary also get it. efficacy data mRNA vaccines still ~78-88%, percentage point breakthrough infections occur uncommon Stop funding schools property taxes might able get decent educational institutions they'll serve greatest good. Dae’shun? didn’t choose coronavirus. media cares clicks views—bad news drives that. Reporting single death COVID latest mega-variant good media. Many people still take reporting face value. That’s see many questions thread contain misinformation speculation. would say vaccine dead. would say ""become complete hermit, get sick multiple times, get permanent physical damage, get vaccinated and/or die"".

After all, options enjoyed simultaneously. mean insultingly. One could easily say Canada up-north version Australia.

Similar histories, similar age (as countries), broadly similar culture, similar population, similar population distribution (Canada's north mostly unpopulated, Australia's Outback), unhealthy fascination America... Canada Australia lot common.  everyone south. I've seen many family friend groups completely split vaccination question (when boiled down, really ends Trump question).

I've always wondered something like civil war could happen families, neighbors, friends actually fought other...well, I've seen it. getting sick isn’t recommended, natural immunity part solution. People unwilling get vaccinated eventually get sick least degree immunity infection, helps reduce spread. people getting sick increases risk mutation, people immune still beneficial PTOs man... kinda vacation/holiday much rather have. see kids 2 wearing face masks? doubt it. barely-1yo understands maybe half dozen words, good luck explaining needs keep mask on. Note CDC never even recommended kids age wear masks. Got 2nd early smaller Ontario clinic last week absolutely packed, said 3k day vs 600 got first dose. orderly course full queues stations. go compare countries death rates slagging response.  live Ontario, Waterloo Region ~ 600,000 people higher case counts Toronto public health unit every day. TPU probably 4-6 times bigger variant took foot hold here. also highest vaccinated percentage world think over. Something like 83% cases non vaccinated people. get jab. Vaccines ""the merrier"" type proposition. keep shots COVID stresses organism immune system.

You gotta strategic. example await new Pfizer shot fall made popular variants. It'll effective going loading whatever find now.  can’t remember efficacy vaccines one dose. around 50%? maybe assume two doses it’s 95% less likely transmit someone else? delta it’s going around 80%? 

That’s lot assumptions I’m glad it’s becoming little clear.  absolutely correct. 

&amp;#x200B;

Signed, 

&amp;#x200B;

An American that's lived many foreign places sense ""home"" anymore.  People 60 can't get wait get supply Pfizer. People 60 want also waiting Pfizer. Looks like death 🤣 That's we're hoping is. concerned wife lost 100% taste days. I'm one who's leaving addition, Delta significantly contagious.  mutation wish Nice, house other.  I'd stay put await developments. 

If gets bad fall people recommend mRNA shots people like you, they'll also modification new variants. don’t see why. It’s different restaurants bars cash only. try avoid them. CIMAvax-EGF lung cancer treatment developed Cuba. Also anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody treatment patients organ transplant rejection, human recombinant erythropoietin treatment anemia, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment neutropenia. 

There’s treatments created kept wraps part, medical tourists Cuba report treatments skin cancer, Arthritis mundane things like acne male pattern baldness. already close quarter population vaccinated using vaccines. That's better many countries better access global market. It’s called harm reduction model. let lot people die unnecessarily AIDS adopted HIV prevention, let lot people die unnecessarily drugs alcohol adopted addiction treatment (and it’s still standard many places) we’re going let lot people die unnecessarily COVID finally get around admitting it’s model best chance working. Basically, idea shitty measure lot people willing adopt way better public health overall perfect measure people willing adopt. 

Problem is, many people would rather feel righteous accomplish goals. See multiple examples thread. Sinopharm okay, like 70/80% Sinovac 50%... 100% effective stopping serious covid. vaccines end Good point.

Personally took Jansen, I'm rock hard place. one April. That’s CDC lifted mask mandates fully Vaxxed people. breakthroughs it’s rare. I’m surprised make little proud hear something there's pandemic responding crisis. everyone US could vaccinated wanted to, 90% least. everyone sick making political statement. got demoralizing, like going treating kids cancer people setting fire joke. sympathy them. Thank you. roll back, faith CDC could make situation worse. guaranteed work end causing unnecessary suffering. people think rationally future risks rewards. also magically disappear (read: die off), they'll end producing variants, another opportunity escape existing treatments immune responses. best models UBI funded progressive taxation. Also, reason UBI can't start beyond poverty line except conservative talking heads would shit pantaloons. Ding ding ding ding ding ""Variant Alpha largely stopped one vaccine dose, Delta it’s really necessary get doses adequate protection. timetable second doses accelerated UK."" neighbors keep complaining noise aluminum mine backyard, worth know I'm getting quality. Immune systems according Pfizer Moderna Thank you.

Not sure political more. karenitos syndrome. 
So example (no mask) shop keepers assume exempt. suppose states assumption could assumed vaccinated, reality ""what virus"" 
Up week CDC gave green light masks off, majority shoo keepers wore masks, might see it, infrequent 

I hope right July globally blows away, take precautions then. Updated notes sources. second gets EUA 6mth-12yrs I'm calling kid's pediatrician asking get shot her. yeah, know. germans problem *following orders* new information (Delta variant) changing behavior back cautious stance makes sense

Genuine question--what new information indicates fully vaccinated people start wearing masks part ""more cautious stance""?

If makes feel safer that's totally fine. begrudge anyone wanting wear mask. imply data driven decision rather emotion seems premature. got downvoted too. yeah you’re right.  Well... Southern states like Texas Florida exact opposite. illegal require vaccine, state funded place (aka schools colleges) even illegal require mask.

The exception medical care facilities.

Wait. worry Texas passed law ensure need license conceal carry gun! Priorities. Hey, small heads someone else told about. comment offensive anything, consider addin edit note striking wrong part instead removing it. way others like follow discussion later :) Pfizer vaccine 18 year olds take Pfizer shipment delayed plus huge Moderna shipment. guess could wait Pfizer end July risking delta variant becoming dominate immunity could two weeks taking second Moderna Fair not, think that's do. People vulnerable--those can't get vaccine medical reasons, etc.--should continue mask, distance isolate can. Actually, anyone who's unvaxxed whatever reason that. 

I know sucks, see anything else society offer them. Look get it. don’t like told government. Neither I. spent first 13 years life Germany. Europe people sense duty community even entails sacrificing curtailing freedom association choice concerning masks. concept Alien us. I’m saying legally state compel vaccinate. ABSOLUTELY NOT. Vaccine Passports May way curb spread people choose vaccinate.  caught virus level immunity, there's guarantee level vaccinated it. 

This makes sense. purpose vaccine trigger body's natural immune response? literally provoking reaction getting exposed virus, it?

Is citation all, suggests vaccinated person ""more immune"" someone sick previously recovered thus antibodies? MSNBC also argued exact thing recently. MSNBC = Fox News 

They two sides coin That's works, one much higher infectious rate fairly quickly dominates new spread. apparently better getting past current behaviors. problem people like me. I’m vaccinated, six year old obviously isn’t medical condition makes high risk. dad anti-vaxxer, anti-masker, big Q, gets son EOW isn’t damn thing it. 

If could leave Mississippi would, custody order locked in.  Yeah insurance deadly injection? Lmao healthy 18 year old males getting swelled heart fools. There’s reason says DONT inject kids. Shits fucked young healthy mid age. Vax old vulnerable want let’s keep fucking moving it’s false narrative that’s spread. credible data natural immunity way less vaccine preventing severe illness hospitalization Yes great way slow spread virus keep sick contagious people public instead hospital receiving treatment. also super duper ethical Depends serious outbreaks are. Vaccinated people well protected serious disease, still get covid transmit it. data drive policies, outbreaks get serious enough, measures like lockdowns mask-wearing table. I’ll concede much true. differences really still millions people low access hard-core anti vaxx. outreach low income communities door door vaccinations still needed.   strategy working far? may true, highlighting might make us feel better, it’s going make problem worse. Sorry losses. 

On completely unrelated note, HIV considered immunocompromised day? heard treatments extremely effective. Compared December won’t lot people high risk death vaccination compared COVID-19, within 95% confidence limit.""

This insane claim.  agree Vaccine proof. It’s way point. it’s Reddit evidently it’s enough fully vaccinated anymore. fully vaxxed, continue wear masks (2 masks according couple thread), fully support mask wearing restrictions going forward. Otherwise you’re asshole “ONLY” getting fully vaccinated. Anti vaxxers aren’t evil ones anymore. narrative isn’t met, fully vaccinated people suck also. concur. willfully refuse vaccine could prevent disease, you. Can’t go crying ‘mommy’ infects you! manufactured, difference(s) 2 versions AstraZeneca vaccine? Peer reviewed mean impartial. research still often done people interest outcome, peer review means independent experts read work said makes sense. actually checked everything themselves. still carry virus even immune I'm mostly okay this. empathy completely run out. want play stupid games take stupid prizes.

What I'm okay stress add doctors nurses working ER COVID units. creates avenue new mutations. want fuck around, let find out. I'd prefer posted articles read Yeah, agree that. wonder could estimated. hitting younger people much harder time. vaccinated pool keep spiking getting high growth. 

What interesting testing contact tracing. hard big place like us. could work focus unvaccinated people. Contact tracing could work well stopping outbreaks. True. fair expect vaccinated continue forced mask social distance? Sinovac effective? LOL Nope. Fully vaccinated, ditched mask unless required. It’s well established mask doesn’t prevent infection, prevents spread. we’ve saying months, trust science, that’s exactly I’m doing, say vaccine effective masks don’t prevent infection. I’m sure shade thrown us following CDC guidelines.  Dense outbreaks dense people. also legally compel people comply state gun laws stop growing weed basement neither seem working them. agree. Poopoo Hmmm…are suggesting wear mask house I’m kids even though wife fully vaxxed? I’m sure understand question. WRONG government legally compel vaccinate. See Jacobson v Massachusetts (1905) nuance wear mask vaccinated even new delta concern watching county case counts they're staying low. going fairly highly vaccinated places. Vermont high vaccination rates low case counts certainly need mask again. really enforced. Shops assume someone wearing mask exempt. Obviously people refused wear mask throughout pandemic vast majority followed rules. 

It become politicised like US wearing mask seems badge political allegiance. Instead, people happy wear required. downside people worn require. never see anyone mask outside even social distancing required possible. upside covid dangerous indoors people prepared wear indoors distancing possible. imagine July masks longer required law nearly disappear.  kids protected can't get vaccinated yet (assuming 12) stopped wearing mask? agree. There's zero point bringing back restrictions mandates--the anti-vaxxers Covidiots ignore (just always have) vaxxed people resent notion they're asked go back ""lockdown"" status protect anti-vaxxers refuse protect themselves. 

The option sit back watch Delta variant thing unvaxxed. sad come that, choices consequences.  second Moderna dose month apart.. also, aren’t mRNA vaccines much harder to
Produce existing labs around world? Wouldn’t traditional vaccine something countries (many sub 5% vaccinated rates) could produce access to. Sinopharm/Sinovac trash. shouldn’t autonomy body body expel something kill kids. people want keep autonomy penalized. get social service help, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, section 8. get tax cuts, child care credit, head household, SALT, etc pay exact tax bracket get deductions. want keep costing nation money? fund it. also don’t need precedent, Supreme Court already ruled legal.  US way would happen arresting taking vaccinated. Otherwise SOL. sort paid monthly subscription? perks purchasing Delta Plus?? People forget NOVEL virus. don’t know whether people ever get sense smell back. don’t know people live entire life brain fog cognitive impairments.

There’s lot good reason want take extra precautions community spread ongoing even vaccinated. sounds like generation replaced one equally selfish bitter. older ones starting get little boomerish, tbh chose accept risk car accidents risk reduction measures place. still risk even measures take reduce (which happens higher children covid). still don’t ban driving, one point draw line willing make public policy protect people. Also measures taken protect children covid too, like vaccinating large percentage adults, recommending many places mandating masks children (just like seatbelts), many schools also offering remote options parents chose home school regardless, businesses offering curbside pickup hospitals public transportation - can’t avoided still require everyone wear masks curious - use eye protection? face shield? goggles kind? first comment thread denigrate China attaching political strings vaccine shipments? LOL blatant politicking US blaring speakers sending vaccines Taiwan. China continued send vaccines Taiwan rejects 100% backhanded deal US.

You're way transparent motives here. Good grief. Yeah. actually was. don’t see point continuing this, thanks.  America made people stupid live Thing is, studies continue extend potential effectiveness vaccines. makes sense they’re wild longer. anti-vaxxers getting “fatigue” new studies giving longer effectiveness timelines, makes clear sense, fuck em. seen evidence someone could get covid twice vaccination.

There, better? force children vaccinated attend public school. new idea. We've weekly deliveries, occasional curbside pickup items available delivery. How??? 

How know 1 year old vaccine protect years??????

Just how???

Do ""primer"" level time machines telling us about??? NooooOooOoo need boosterssss  mom hospitalized Covid 2 weeks getting Sinovac vaccine 2 months ago. sadly looks like make it. ""my team"" lol

it's genuinely sad can't possibly comprehend world red blue doesn’t hurt Canada received millions millions vaccines USA much lot population vaccine hesitant I’m super protected now, got it. 30 dsys paid vacation still think even nearly enough. Dont know americans it. disingenuously arguing point nobody making. sorts smaller steps could taking protect children besides locking away. arguments adults getting vaccinated lower spread protect kids, example. 

Your logical fallacy straw-man argument, bastardize someone's argument argue that, rather reasonable point making. mean like US? Cuba higher standard healthcare U.S.

Have actually hospitalized Cuba poor? think so. Agreed, sounds dumb try convince us he's legit. He's friend sounds like quack. really stuffed up. Changing health advice 50s 60s (using AZ) help either. saying age got Pfizer age got AZ make much sense people. people think Pfizer good vaccine give blood clots. .006% fully vaccinated people, pretty solid. Time hit pool! /s mean, really trusting authoritarian government? coping. Go look Taiwan reacted vaccines. Keep crying Science always updates that's one great things it. stick tradition ""consistency "", medicine would pretty dangerous. Scientists constantly scrutinize evidence sake betterment. asymptomatic. long expect test positive? week exposure? 2 weeks? month? don’t really know answer? real question many variants show less threat? Yes. non medical doctor dispensing medical advice. 25% sent COVAX. Great demonstration rational thinking there. hope US, see spike cases, relegated spots low vaccination rates areas high uptake don’t shit actions hesitant. ban UK travelers going Hong Kong. People Hong Kong banned going UK. still flights leaving Hong Kong UK effective jnj vaccine delta variant? Yeah, like said, cases affecting unvaccinated group till recently eligible receive vaccine. pretty problematic people make incorrect statements assertion get upvoted people want hear, somehow. hard people understand story plot written advance unfortunately.  &lt;3 Yeah already addressed ""wake then"" comment. Please refer back one. Cool announced something set take place unspecified date future. different actually damn thing.

Nice try though. bad expect get called out. Nah. know way many people whose cruise vacations resulted explosive diarrhea 2-3 solid days. Don’t feel strong need hop one even best times. 😂 examples make wonder f nervous system due covid. really sux  Yes Explain mean false sense security vaccines. you’re absolutely wrong that. Post text. No, misinterpret. wrong. going feels, instead objective logic. get it. pandemic bad, scary, traumatized us. bogeyman. going hunt us forever. Like pandemics, end. sure related moving wet dirt via wheel barrel dumped dirt new location smelled like poop really nasty smelling too. happened twice.

Have experienced elsewhere Ignorance really excuse world much information literally finger tips. Gaining workable understanding purpose operating mechanisms mRNA probably requires 20 minutes. expert? course not. fears DNA altered mRNA vaccine assuaged? likely. funniest part silly little bit conspiracy well known viruses often insert DNA way, meaning vaccine actually protects DNA altered. cry harder Given need two shots, 8Bn would vaccinate population. continues confound think access information.

From today [U.S. Ships First Coronavirus Vaccines Abroad, Donating 2 Million they're even shipped yet, ""already started"" lie.

On top that, ""President Joe Biden committed share 80 million doses America's supply countries around world.""

Now got B+ math, bear me, 80 million quite ""500million+"" claim.

It's like trying hit bingo blatant lying. think that's actually bit problem. We're essentially seeing discourse crisis play real time. Usually time makes public awareness, there's degree consensus scientific community. There's time stuff. 

So take discourse that's evolving apply public policy. 

Government communications team given information public health experts expected transmit general public. Messaging designed definitive consistent across platforms. Government leaders briefed expected help carry message media sources.

General public gets carpet bombed information official sources, local jurisdictions, journalists pick press releases, elected officials, public health rep's.

By time received information sources generally trust reliable information. trust information trust source, trust source generally definitive information. Soon, friends family receive similar information awhile public consensus starts develop. 

And academic discourse shifts. 

It's hard see people become skeptical sources generally consider consistent monolithic change discourse. see lacking consistency. doubt consistency information coming out, less receptive new information. 

TLDR: Scientists always communications specialists, expecting general public immediately shift discourse really misses mark. vaccinated? There's evidence getting vaccinated helps long haul issues. got one J&amp;J one MRNA shot (Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna) need review “basic science” you’re going parade opinion around authoritatively without regard data.

Studies shown natural immunity COVID found inferior long-lasting vaccines. sister BIL COVID later got shots. Honestly? risk US died last year. Two weeks second shot, although I’ve also seen 1 week. However long wait it’s shot #2. There's asymptomatic people developed complications ranging lung issues neurological issues COVID. would assume also lose sense smell well. Sorry. misinterpreted. I’m talking entire life 99% people planet used all. corona virus cold? Sure. One that’s deadly? No. willfully say it’s purely ignorant. One thing list locking kids house refusing take anywhere car, despite chance dying getting seriously maimed. strikes government mandated quarantine prevent Covid 19 infection kids bridge far. friend's Dr (not medical dr claiming he's working scientists university) telling get vaccine. They're saying since covid need it, telling Hydroxychloroquine actually helped people (maybe expected), possibly dog deworming medication could help point, non conventional advice. friend taking advice seriously, I'm quite scared them. Especially since want around us we're high risk. 

Is Dr disservice giving kind advice? report him? I'm seriously scared friend feel like end well experience covid really bad. Yes, silly point. Someone getting abortion affects handful people involved process. getting vaccinated spreading Covid around effect much larger broader scope people. certain things people must sacrifice openly freely participate society feel like getting vaccinated, unless medically unable, one things. Anti vaxxers don’t ammunition begin with, whole “crusade” based completely falsified report doctor license taken away stealing drugs use Spanish flu entirely new humans form. Spanish flu known disproportionately killing young healthy people. disease random effects. people get sick, don't, die, don't. psychologically used flu, this. That's biggest difference. *feels* different you, impacts substantially different pandemic flus were. Conjecture: opinion conclusion formed basis incomplete information.

As per Oxford Dictionary. think complete information pertaining long-term effects covid vaccines lying yourself. ...if viruses mutate

Look flu shots - people get time still ""flu season"" care. COVID going anywhere best immunity natural immunity zero one hyper-specific aspect virus like vaccines do. Thanks sharing. doesn’t hurt extra sanitizer hand. masks worn hay fever flu/ cold season.  Already started. 

Taiwan, South Korea, Brazil, Peru, Canada, Mexico got shipments already way.

Time stay date news Disney Cruise Line postponing first test cruise since pandemic brought cruise industry standstill handful participants inconsistent test results Covid-19, company said Disney Dream scheduled set sail Tuesday Port Canaveral, Florida, 300 employees volunteered ""simulation"" cruise. trip postponed next month, pending approvals, small number employees inconsistent results Covid-19, ""which considered positive CDC,"" Disney said Centers Disease Control Prevention, CDC, approved cruise line's request conduct two-night test federal government starting allow cruises sail again, nearly passengers crew vaccinated virus. Republican Florida Gov.

For months lots Pfizer people got Pfizer first doses, time second doses, tons Moderna, almost Pfizer, lots 12-17 year olds take Pfizer. trying convince people okay mix match. exactly year since tested positive covid sense smell nothing like used be. really hope comes back fully cook enjoy food/having fully functioning senses... Calling now: theyre gonna push back reopening mid September Long-term sad sufferer here. also get dawn emulating alarm clocks work great me! That's said. 

In fact, post close I'd post rebuttal someone saying that. longer there. nose/brain recognize smell something blank/empty. started really smell floral smells slowly gotten better mainly anything rose specific Exactly, variants considered real problem mRna vaccines people understand. Seems weird compare based many doses recommends taking without considering factors like time doses. 3 doses take 1 week apart would likely best vaccine. Nice contribution. I’ve definitely never heard argument word word every. I’m serious. It’s crazy. Wish award give uncanny ability original. Honestly, bother. old mud-wrestling pig problem. get covered shit pig enjoys it. Given restrictions currently Ontario last summer (without vaccines) surprised. Please get PCR test. It’s conjecture. It’s well informed decisions based long, long time research. [I found article useful safety mRNA Based read, mRNA vaccines delivered via nanolipids appear safer live attenuated virus vaccines. also proving highly effective, past vaccines made methods. 

Do think 5 years long term enough? 5 years? read article, would seen vaccines negative side effects within much shorter duration. 

Medicine continue advance faster rates computing power networks improve. vaccine developed faster vaccine whole world involved, decades research mRNA vaccines, enormous amount money partitioned development. skeptical want, every day data confirming new vaccines safe highly effective. *can* define terms opposition one another. someone says “I’m Democrat” understood mean “I’m Republicans doing.” 100% reminiscent teams sports game. 

I’m saying aren’t reasons this, sides equally fault. truly polarized...battle realities K remember told now. Get mRNA shots common knowledge. Hey. Thanks offering you’ll future part problem! announced morning, I'm sure PHU's making booking times available find supply targets. disagree. really entirely new humans form. It’s easier spread world much different say 1919 “Spanish” flu. There’s also seemingly weird randomness dies. friend lost husband. Avid running. Super healthy. Nothing underlying. 45 dead covid. So, nope. like flu me. Get tested. Please don’t risk spreading others. last, robust study found nearly 100% recovered covid regained sense smell year, often times much less. 15 minute test going fairly low sensitivity detecting Covid, even symptoms 72% likely catch Covid positive case (58% without symptoms) entirely possible Covid even negative result -- 3 10 Covid patients people get negative rapid test. 1,215 cases US 2019. right, sometimes day goes without case, statistically, that's bad statement. averages 3-4 day. I’m still masked stores I’m little lax things great around here…. Although I’m thinking late fall winter may need …. Anyone suffering psoriasis Pfizer injection? mean… that’s small effort individual level don’t understand anyone would’ve worried it.

Is company going give two additional sick days year boosters? that's long leveled first round shots. even kids would need caretaking yearly boosters either. EU countries last open everyone 18 generally ones eventually vaccinate most. donating China Russia combined cope must 18+, first dose, since current first doses 18+ 50-60% doses administered every day second doses many countries. Los Angeles fully reopened case numbers rising slightly. Test positivity, however, doubled last 2 weeks. numbers low due less testing. Delta working magic. point? saying anything occur UK guaranteed government act weeks months late, leaving airlines open last year late, leaving planes open India year, lists endless. Wether still bloody mink farming absolutely irrelevant, could coronavirus mutate ferret, UK government would still nothing late, understand? changing definitions words changing subject conversation, good day you. Hehe, Dr. Snape   mean though. rolling average almost 10x higher two months ago, clearly still increasing. 

You fairly say cases hitting mostly unvaccinated people, deaths hospitalizations increasing far less rapidly before, cases certainly soaring. Authorized yes seems take second fiddle AZ. places sitting allocated doses.

COVID eradicated China, plain simple. socialist functional
.... Don’t fucking lump us gen x’rs boomers.  much information coming confusing. tell us “shop” vaccines there’s articles like this. Also originally going get J&amp;j it’s 1 shot find it’s 60 something % effective vs 90, seems like something kind worth driving next town for...

Also today NPR one guests said longer wait two doses vaccines, effective is, 3 times effective. it’s already 90% something effective, times 3? anyone help lol thought original herd immunity strategy protect vulnerable allow young healthy naturally resolve virus. think issue at-risk population high vaccination rate. We're worrying group people at-risk get Covid. Deaths Covid 30 years old 3000. Factor potential number 30s infected death rate astronomically low. car accident likely event kill young person Covid. blame 24 year old healthy person taking vaccine, putting anyone risk risk people vaccinated opportunity get vaccinated. left US. Also less corrupt.  vaccinated provides protection others. risk infected reduced 90%. infected, risk spreading reduced I'll lower viral load.

With mRNA vaccine, I've paid service washes dishes use them. Getting vaccinated protecting others. Dude, crazy. communications war, too.

This actual Chilean government talking applying different ones running numbers. believe in?  doubt Get covid test first. Lots things cause fever chills. 

From seen posts people say 5 days mild symptoms vaccinated people competition see less likely, large amounts communities [low vax question conservatives low af rates, im saying can't scapegoat one group others too. USA update first dose shots:

True hypocrisy professing belief actually hold. Like politician publically equal rights, actually believing that. actually see big problem either, long publically held belief good one. Sure hypocrite moral honesty issues internal conflict affect me. Yea good evil, like Jesus. That’s base world people could care less anymore. know people sub tip spear people don’t care anymore. Bad things sometimes happen good people, that’s life unfortunately. Sometimes people end unlucky end disease statistics. 20,000+ people ages die flu yearly don’t shelter place flu season every year.

I feel bad kid, couldn’t imagine they’re going right now, threat level Covid kids general lower influenza, probably even lower kid household taking precautions. kid ages 2-11 household isn’t eligible vaccine yet, need take individual action protect point.

 got mild PTSD people telling us botched vaccine strategy.... Smallpox doesn’t zoonotic reservoir host. know mammals harbor Covid, like pigs birds flu. there’s non-human reservoir, it’s going go like smallpox. Lol ok there's way would abused. Papers, please!  sure right place post goes. fully vaccinated end May I've covid symptoms since last night (fever chills mainly). wondering long symptoms last vaccinated? information find online vaccinated yet. Anyone caught covid they've vaccinated share experiences? Well Iran obviously banned American British vaccine Polio close too. Hopefully gets eradicated well.

There comment Pfizer Moderna yet.” want 0 cases period. might succeed short time they're island nation IMO impossible metric achieve. open doors cases come. vast, vast majority people Covid symptoms. immune invincible? fully vaccinated person since February spent week CA, **phew**. think something mRNA vaccines provokes huge response, lots people feel pretty ill shot, including myself. haven’t similar responses vaccines I’ve had. Maybe it’s adjuvant? Moderna.

If booster would love viral vector type, traditional attenuated/inactivated virus, compare. Duh! start nonprofit fund journalists. need pay bills — expect do?  good look literally changes every day/week there’s absolutely reason trust it. trust today it’s probably going 180 tomorrow next week?

It’s like eggs. Eggs good you! wait eggs bad you! wait cholesterol eggs good cholesterol they’re good! wait, excess cholesterol bad even good cholesterol eggs bad you! Etc etc etc.

So live good bad you, data both. it? It’s coin flip. might scientific process, don’t surprised people lose trust everything told believe today might totally wrong tomorrow, right month later, wrong month later that. certain point give go years decades longer.  mind seeing come Canada too. got first dose may told 2nd dose would scheduled time August. checked provincial health site, earliest book appointment October. fly Delta? vaccine card.  used Europe like B cells part immune system.

You’re going get vaccine you’re going get covid. Even vaccine, still might get covid (though it’s unlikely kill you). world cannot hide covid. 

I sincerely hope quickly get vaccines everyone world wants one. personally would expect Germany reach least 85 percent adults vaccinated mid-August 80 percent total population end Summer. think another small decrease vaccine hésitants deaths hospitalizations? Lmao that’s accurate I'm saying even before, would find reason. Anyone find stats many people died last period time(6 months, year, 18 months) previous time period pre-covid?


US and/or world. Yet US effective vaccines. Vaccines made China Russia proven unreliable. Cases soaring UK---22,868 US equivalent 110,000 cases, US reporting 10,000 to15,000 cases stupid ppl please get shots NOW! includes ""macho"" first responders who're manly &amp; strong think need get vaccinated. literally ppl developing countries like India would move heaven &amp; earth get chance one vials, yet ppl Golden State regions US DGAF. grandmother (84 yo) two doses sinovac vaccine, hospitalised faring quite well. healthy person quite old, vaccine actually saved her. people get vaccinated infected, chance new mutations basically head towards 0.

Wut? Explain virus mutates?  Sorry, failing see comment differs saying? expect us done duty got vaccinated, afforded right get back normal. forced wear masks distance order try protect vaccinated. Agreed. really need watch fever, coughing, shortness breath.  I'm sort basing country. first seemed handle situation well became total shit show people disrespecting rules whatever. got surprisingly better amount people wanting get vaccine really low. part probably badly country handled things many biggest politicians want vaccine themselves. reason people decide whether want vaccine based favorite politician says based least favorite politician want. family holdout sister husband. nurse sister. Uncontrollable natural conditions like allergies cystic fibrosis might need normalize mask wearing on. kinda good see Israel experimenting option. way we'll data approaches countries know better whether open not. “When done correctly” heavy lifting there. Even well-intentioned people truly wanted follow mitigation efforts weren’t always perfectly. lot masks didn’t fit well, peeking noses, etc. people never gave crap made even less effective. 

What wanted masks much better accomplished vaccines. Lithuanian donated 20K vaccines Taiwan ago triggered bromance guess becomes semantic argument point. commenter referring vaccine itself, immune response result vaccine. vaccines game plan organizes way beat opposing offense, keep football example. shield, protective, actual offensive weapon. again, really useful argue either way, pedantic.  like people use term ""post-pandemic"" refer current times, pandemic officially over. stop 2 weeks could get 2 months? 

Imagine much happier people would could eff worry work couple months Delta variant. husband got appendicitis shortly second Pfizer dose. Purely speculative posited two related given husbands significant immune response inflammatory state leading appendicitis. 

We’re still board future boosters offered us I’ve never ever seen sick second shot. Counting lucky stars hasn’t ever actually covid. True, I've always felt certain subjects paywalled though, like health/weather/election related stuff problem, similar concepts words German focus host versus virus. Oh God, they’re calling us J&amp;J’ers “people like you” now

BTW, languages nuanced ways deliver idea ""a group people belong"", form appropriate different context. Non-native speakers sometimes get trouble using best form (because native language forms different).

Source: English native language. figured so. still effective vaccines. Israel’s decision statement never meant everywhere going go reverse bring back lockdowns. think lot people shock. hear ya There's course action embark on; that's issue. do? know PTO. think I'll let others take first see well works them.  Huh? point hardly vaccination right strategy using mitigate virus spread. 

If vaccinations get 60%/70% level, sure stop lockdown live virus. fact any. Canada Aus similar size economy. Canada also local vaccine production. vaccination numbers speak themselves. There's also much evidence causes harm kids young, besides outliers. Better assume harm - lack evidence encouraging least. science shows vaccines work. 

Once people get vaccinated infected, chance new mutations basically head towards 0.

The chances getting covid twice 0... get close 0 nobody around covid (because immunity). Wearing masks months longer end year really bugs you. information paper, seems available free:  Thanks! Alexander Hamilton founded NY Post. 10 dollar American Bill. NY Post credible source I'd quote. That's even older paper Guardian. Anyway, left important details. Like super majority people died also old. 70 kids testing positive single day country 9 million *any* stretch cause alarm. That's point. many 70 kids symptoms? many ended hospital? Also, since mentioned two words German. English, similar differentiation: 'coming contact virus' 'being infected virus'. 

'Coming contact with' - physical action host encountering virus. include minor infection limited number cells immune systems fights strictly immune system/antibodies neutralizing virus. 

'Being infected virus' - host comes contact virus, virus able infect cells degree overwhelm immune system begin spread, establishing infection. Nope green passport next week so. already got mine Mail goverment. giant qr Code plus writing kind of. implications gets vaccines become dark political extremely quickly.  problem grandmother family age bracket, essentially used family doctor laying (ie, illness, need, hard stop). used medical information evolving, making super confused lol So, normal 70 kids everyday infected? dramatic logic talking about, Israel 10 Million pop, huge country.  1.) people can’t vaccinated take precautions whole life. It’s terrible hand that’s nature. Also, kids recover rather easily covid. give cherry picked story one losing limbs covid, that’s big outlier.

2.) science physical science nature. also social psychological science. We’ve worse pandemics covid been, went back pre pandemic lives them, around amount time now.

3.) verified epidemiologist ama Reddit said variant evades vaccines, also invade immune system infect us longer. Oxford also recently put study saying thing.  live Minnesota (the Midwest) large majority people vaccinated. TIL India like Republican led states Trump administration.  feel folks.

Get vaccination, get Covid 19 Delta Variant.

It's much easy catch moves like wildfire.

Get poked get Covid. Ooo Aren’t polite. approved vaccine better vaccine.  People like condolences :) So, short answer know, nobody does. 

There's lot IFs present response. people still test high antibodies natural infection year ago.

But people also contracted Covid twice... again, lifetime immunities. seem pretty short. Nobody knows.

But saying ""it's going go away... eventually"" Trump said, almost exactly. sure wanna boat guy issue Define everywhere else, another user confirmed Indonesia also much issues. guy hindu nationalist Modi supporter. run excuses defend supreme leader, pull ""you white people stay this"" card.  Hopefully never lockdowns future pay (and breakthrough infections) never happen.

And necessary herd immunity happens 100% get vaccinated infected. ""Could,"" ""may,"" can't wait known fact instead speculated.  may confusing article OP. us replying different times. would times focus somebody definitely go back prison? sympathy someone knowingly distributed lethal narcotics caused overdoses. anything, sentence light. EUA longer-term efficacy, safety. requirements safety full authorization compared EUA. happens muscle cells affected mrna vaccine? die, get killed immune system go back normal producing spike protein? Lol got vilified thread post saying nothing benefits wearing mask outside pollution pollen alone. ( tell everyone wearing masks outside stating pollen won’t going throat lungs)  15 people, weeks 2nd shot two vacines, show good immune response. different british study 90 people.

 people hear: ""You never need another covid shot"".

This good news people need walking around thinking 'everything over, permanently defeated'.   allergy season full swing, can't stop sneezing day every day  Practically one Australia vaccinated natural immunity. That’s difference. don’t potential huge deadly outbreak anymore. Maybe country prioritized vaccines wouldn’t lockdowns. I'm sure degree - turn news open news site see mrna discussion. true j&amp;j. That's I'm saying. Actually internet free, ISP take money. honest, give badly situation handled, surprised saying Americans want get vaccinated thought. taken Zyrtec 3x last month. wear mask outside time. Usually time year severe seasonal allergies even Zyrtec. eyes got itchy watery grass pollen extremely high, hence Zyrtec 3x. Allergy sufferers, take note! Even 2 layer cotton mask decrease pollen. It’s really important jab keeps people hospitals, J&amp;J that. Also taking 14 days big plus ever growing numbers (especially vaccine keeps Delta variant) it’ll help ease stress healthcare systems around globe. look Africa, imagine logistics -70°C wouldn’t easy kind high temperatures. Researchers happy get 67% annual influenza vaccine. pros cons. kind garbage propaganda this? Ofcourse would surpass us absolute numbers due huge population. real metric percentage population fully vaccinated, india terrible job in. Curious, pharmacist, would give Pfizer Morderna first dose someone fully vaccinated JJ?  Finally convinced couple friends holding idea embarrassing would get seriously sick covid NOW. point people don’t much empathy anymore you’re unvaxxed. exclude countries 1 million inhabitants, single country world reached 70% total population one dose. Canada actually first days now.

It’s gone bit radar, Wales ([population reached 71.1% population one dose (and 51.3% two). Although sovereign state (being part UK), it’s still country right. Currently vaccinated 89.3% eligible population (18+) one dose, 64.5% two. haven’t noticed whiplash news much sub. People read much article sudden get mass people panicking. another post fine.  charged conspiracy distribute mean person selling fentanyl. different 'breakpoints' different drugs contribute greatly difference getting charged simple possession kind sales charge.

In many cases breakpoints set absurdly low levels drugs created public panic, oftentimes police departments use dirty tricks increase weight seized drugs get tougher charge.

For instance, dont think like anymore, least 80s 90s, got caught LSD blotters, would weigh entire paper blotter record weight pure LSD. comparison, one blotter square usually contains around 100 micrograms LSD, paper square weighs around 7 milligrams, 7000 micrograms...meaning got caught single dose LSD blotter paper, could charged amounts posession 70 doses, enough distribution charge. SINGLE TAB BLOTTER.

Probably best judge others based solely drug charges without knowing details, considering lies, deceptions, criminal behavior authoritarianism signature war drugs since inception. Ok, suspect booster shot variants realm possibility either. Wrong - Immunogenic response. shit even plague still around  Alcohol smoke usually behind many deaths they're perfectly legal. I'm advocating pro-drug dealing, US approach drugs probably erroneous. Indeed also people possess drugs consumption get punished  fiction? I'm unaware school districts requiring vaccination eligible students staff. Los Angeles school district announced requirement sued teachers union withdrew policy.

Several universities vax policy, major K-12 districts? Eligible ages only, obviously. feel like took wrong conclusions figures. reason 910 deaths *because* harsh measures like lockdowns. time country Covid free, introduced breaches quarantine. area Australia local transmission Covid year now. Per CDC, currently contraindication Pfizer based egg thing Precautions'

Next time talk doctor, bring egg thing, sounds like longer allergy eggs eating time fine Yes watched YouTube video dangerous stoves sometimes cause fires burn houses I'm going safe cook Napalm. tell live life, affect you.

Outside Australia/New Zealand, possibly countries Asia, border closures don’t anything. Many countries still sake appearance taking things seriously. 

I think lot countries scared let anything, they’ll look like Trump Bolsonaro. Damn that's wild. worked clinic max throughput 1/3 that. mean older people look think deserve liveable wage? going long period poverty 

Have living rock? already generation ""I got mine, fuk everyone else"" still alive voting. Internet isn’t free either. Less year testing 'rigorous testing' context vaccines? intensely scary. Hope guy related Sidney Gottlieb, murdered amd tortured many CIA That's problem lockdown strategy general. really easy start one, hard part actually ending it. really pretty far flu, shares external symptoms, misinformation took there. family completely vaccinqted. wear people's young ones.  I'm Florida. county school masks fall. see issues fall low vaccination rate know many parents vaccinate kids. Use Google. don’t care spend time arguing “it’s cold” COvID troll. Multiple studies done - don’t believe actual scientists, random internet stranger isn’t going convince you. /r/fibromyalgia feels pain. We’ve facing challenges guys encountering looooong time. fog inability basic functions terrible. Jokes you. dense outbreaking already right now.   significant portion population unvaccinated. caught covid back October. Got admitted ICU couple weeks. scarred lungs. dad also ICU. lungs scarred badly ventilator helping anymore. died almost 2 months ICU. 

An article said 50% new cases Israel people already vaccinated. I'm already vaccinated still fear catching again. Weight issue covid comorbidities. covid, many issues, main problematic ones regarding heart lungs. think would survive bout covid.  higher rates unvaccinated, greater chance vaccinated people catching it. can't treat two populations affect one another. far know, less likely get infected covid

What? now, clear results say vaccination prevents transmission extent (even though first test results seem support thesis).

I'd say graph cases Israel pretty clear result showing prevents transmission.

Multiple links here, halfway comment Cuba's vaccine supposedly good Pfizer fwiw Restrictions could like Estonia - travel allowed via airlines. 
 Finnish citizens always allowed leave country return, constitution.  
 
And completely insane case epidemics Ebola. dont hope so, pretty sure ended mutation. dont think cases Denmark mutation.  UK EU vaccine passports anyway UK part EU. seems like survivorship bias. Israel's adult population vaccinated like 80+% naturally infections unvaccinated population. people getting sick twice, next variant (and knows, maybe Delta too) might easier catch multiple times.  Eventually, mutant strain emerge current vaccines work against, we'll back square one. it'll wipe humanity.  efficacy data Delta mRNA vaccines still looks really good, idk idea vaccinated people protected getting delta variant protected severe illness coming February right. Ivermectin. people know, people get PCR test, whole virus genome sequences like rap lyric something? Didnt vaccinated people die delta variant non vaccinated? Yeah.  Well another lockdown August. Bold statement. Source please Australia (trying) pursue vaccinations? Pretty good idea, boost vaccinations andnl internal spending. vaccine diplomacy race begun.

I'll happily annoying one forever saves one person's life. contagious seem think, would need vaccinate. Everyone would infected, everywhere. Monstrous depends live narrative shifting “vaccinated people low risk getting COVID first place” “vaccinated people protected severe illness”? efficacy data mRNA vaccines Delta still looks really good thoughts. Got J&amp;J back April vaccine appointments hard come first available me. I’m like...well J&amp;J people supposed do? I’ve seen articles experts received J&amp;J say getting Pfizer/Moderna aren’t official recommendations. least I’ve found. I’d really like CDC address this. No, think will. Gotcha  Delta spreading? Nice. proof/link that? 50/50 think type supplied.

AZ slightly worse, much different don’t think vaccinations, also people recovered already. They're pretty unlikely able infected again.

No need fret yet. recommendation article delay 2nd dose beyond delayed (e.g. countries supply limited), loss effect fact opposite - higher levels antibodies 2nd dose 45 weeks.

The practical interesting part 3rd booster administered 6 months 2nd significantly boosts antibody T-cell responses ""*and responses result higher neutralising antibody titers enhanced activity variants""*

One conclusions evidence purported 'vector immunogenicity' could spoil effectiveness repeated doses. Definitely sounds like smug thing say, ironically. Perhaps true. would. case, bet there’s thousands pharmacy nursing students would love months. less likely get asymptomatic covid well.

That’s joke. state bubble. Ha right. virus dangerous vaccine. Every side effect hear vaccine much better thing infection.

Myocarditis (heart inflammation)? common infected people vaccination. 

Clots? common infection factor of, lots, can't find article. 

Headaches? Virus worse.

And goes on. 

The virus way worse vaccine. vaccine better virus. Branson (plus Springfield nearby) Bethany, town I've never heard here, running control. Last thing need St. Louis twits fucking everyone denial.

**GET FUCKING VAXXED** science still air it.

Some good news caught SARS survived lasting immunity COVID-19. one conclusively knows reason type 1 diabetes.  body’s cells attack cells pancreas boom gone type 1 diabetes rest life.  It’s eating poorly, inactive, much trappings associated type 2 diabetes.

My 12yo niece living NYC developed type 1 diabetes months covid spike.  brother doesn’t think family covid curiosity watching overall prevalence type 1 coming years.  huge uptick telling.  correlation causation, Covid weird disease causes problems multiple systems human body. hate position need let run kids “we know doesn’t effect them” it’s way get with.  

These people spouting unknown long term impact vaccines vehemently denying long term impacts covid.  It’s unbelievably disingenuous. You’re right, god forbid express frustration. 

I won’t step line anymore, master. apologize. Right there’s data one make recommendation. 

However, seen experts recommending second dose efficacy J&amp;J likely lower mRNA vaccine. every person getting sick potential viable variants. That’s everyone getting sick dumb fucking idea. pandemic end vaccines. Yeah, realized dumb sounds now. Whoops lot people complaining conservatives, rightly so, biggest problem. fact 45% young adults vaccinated is. sociable group result much high transmission someone older. Sometimes feel like North South two separate countries they're different People really still upvote needing mask OUTDOORS full vaccination garbage? Insane. Vaxxed not, throwing masks away stupid. I'm vaxxed wear masks still. wait till autumn Delta severe variant start killing lots people another mask mandate. sub seen variant “roll everything back”? It’s know point. They’re completely obsessed. Something else I’ve noticed common see people sub talking friends they’ve lost due pandemic don’t associate friends family “didn’t take seriously”. always gets upvoted. No, you’re insane cut people lol. Sorry, ranting Statistics class ever hated.  people less likely become infected covid, significantly so. Lockdowns? Zero chance, happening 

Overwhelmed health systems? country wide scale. Individual pockets low vaccinated areas may push capacity won’t overwhelm anything cause complete chaos. cared decision correct issue contradicting guidance wouldn’t “sick tired bullshit.” weren’t talking people. don’t doubt want what’s necessary preserve yourself, frustration shows don’t appreciate new absolutely need change plans even contradicts previous ones. would understanding less hostility you. That's certainly true, virus becomes equivalent cold issue.  sick part solution. flu.

Even was, fucking wants get sick? sick sucks. Even super deadly case sniffles, I'd still get vaccinated.

Add is, indeed, deadly hell go people? want get vaccine shots? healthy crippled fucking amazing want stay way.  also reflection America centric world view. vaccine situation back different Europe time. problem misinformation rarely behind paywall leading current situation regards spread misinformation. get enough immunity wont even testing worthless. yet headlines studies indicated might need booster shots. It’s way early start taking gospel yet official NACI recommendation says, ""Individuals received first dose mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) offered mRNA product second dose. product readily available, product used first dose unknown, another mRNA vaccine considered interchangeable used complete series.""

And detailed notes say, ""No data currently exist interchangeability COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. However, reason believe mRNA vaccine series completion different authorized mRNA vaccine product result additional safety issues deficiency protection.""  Viva la Firefox know covid Nov 2019 , severe version “cold” I’ve ever experienced lasted 3 extra days(6 total) normal me(if get sick , it’s roughly less year Max 3 days). recognized early symptom immediately went overheating body layers eating/drinking spicy things overheat. 
Twice woke coughing phlegm cause couldn’t breathe. bit scary genuinely annoyed experience scared it. wanted shit with. haven’t sick since whatsoever. Nadda damn nothin . like mask use whenever anyone gets cold. seems ridiculously respectful wear one around others. common knowledge?

The virus ever eradicated human history smallpox. People still catch plague ffs. Si, mask. Social distancing small price pay, that’s ridiculous. I’m fully vaccinated friends/family, able whatever fuck would like them. anyone’s immuno compromised sure, I’m throwing away parts life extremely small chance somehow pass something someone can’t get vaccinated That's want hear about. much virulence, severity/morbidity Delta strain. 
I mean good careful, death rate rise pre vaccination levels...
I'm far comfortable. Seems like pandemic highlighted stunning failures management many, many workplaces. Early start pandemic, policy expert said something thee effect better retrospectively say “we much, OK” little live consequences.

I think point even right amount, retroactively people say much. True reputation (rightfully) always toilet.  let’s hope real vaccines fake news AstraZeneca? I’ve tried keep expectations cautious focus improvements mean me. feel like efficacy Moderna shots took major hit, could adapt I’d likely still enough protection something like go relaxing hike mask on, even people using trail. could also feel relaxed things can’t avoid around people, like getting gas.

And honestly don’t care vaccine makes feel like got hit truck days vaccine safe COVID not. look vaccine side effects “fake illness” vaccine helping, harming. Ha!! Nope, south Charlotte. never problems spelling state capital! Lol LOL Covid, success breeds failure later. Canada great vaccination perspective last months hit like freight train. well Australia would incentive get vaccinated. nice sent full stash anti Vaxers may finally want it. Oh gave away can’t late - wait whattttt want now!!!! past year, Abu Dhabi also required many citizens download COVID contact tracing app, called COVID cases deaths per capita pretty average, massive number people flying Dubai good UAE kept infections low have. It’s literally ‘think children’ types try control everyone via sympathy

Makes sick tbh we're absolutely sure used restart mink farming industry. That's problem regular folks getting scientific info.

Regular folks hear ""no data show vaccines last years"" ""vaccine shown effective 6 months"" think means actually proven 6 months upper bound.

Not can't definitively say lasts longer yet say definitely lasts long sure. okay that's science works nobody listens idiots, let chime on. actually recommended get 2nd dose mRNA vaccine AZ, since immune response higher.

(My mom got 1st Pfizer, AZ shot.) dont think raw numbers fair comparison US 10x population people got ""Corona Enhancer"" shot. Bit miscommunication sadly... Damn would suck second vaccine suffering, better lol It’s almost vaccines work Could, might, maybe. Part issue less wide distribution. think US, Brazil, Denmark (I think), Mexico South Africa countries using it. Brazil getting shipment days ago. South Africa didn’t nearly enough. Denmark saw reports people getting days ago. isn’t widespread Delta areas. Phase III trials well variants I’d suspect well Delta well.

If you’re hearing masses sick people breakthroughs it’s gotta it’s job. got Greece, love EU. Goodness, hope so. 


It would amazing really needed stay latter part phase III (phase IV?) trial Moderna clearly identifiable drop-off efficacy 2 years in. would treat! add concern (2), cases whilst rolling vaccines, larger virus v vaccine antibody warfront have, chances virus break start eating back lines.

Less issue highly vaccinated nations, concern many (some populated) nations not.

Ideally, vaccinate entire population day - outside countries low case counts, can't really achieve (or end that, anyway). Add list international workers students cannot enter. nothing border inflexibility policy cruelty. stopped bit third wave saw CBC reporting people again. I'm tentatively figuring get back early August, based late-July second dose (8 week separation someone mid-20s) - bit easier imagine right either side, next update seems lot likelier proper developments since closed. next month Ontario probably one vaxxed areas world long term critically important, far people realize. Getting shots arms challenging public health standpoint; people lazy especially something imminent threat (eg. virus already innoculated for). Long term immunity population mean lot less likelihood sporadic upticks.  Many young people work retail service jobs

In words exactly sort jobs bring contact large numbers people therefore carry increased risk infection. “A mix-and-match approach Covid vaccines - using different brands jab first second doses - gives good protection pandemic virus, UK study found.
The Com-Cov trial looked efficacy either two doses Pfizer, two AstraZeneca, one followed other.
All combinations worked well, priming immune system.
This knowledge could offer flexibility vaccine rollout, say experts.
The trial results also hint people already received two doses AstraZeneca vaccine could stronger immune response given different jab booster recommended Great, reality Australia (and select countries) adopted policies cruelty absolutely means enter country international worker student. Imagine life put hold likely 2 year minimum 0 certainty. countries (South Korea Taiwan) largely contained pandemic without irreparably disrupting peoples' lives. Yes, vaccines form long term prevention, short term treatment. take (weeks) protect threat appear little warning. 

To limit use moment local transmission low, akin saying don’t need wear seatbelt don’t see much traffic road. here. extra time, resources administering another dose would take, hopefully bothers me. hopefully, booster required. 

Also, felt great second shot, hopefully that's need. virus reproduces, mutate. 

When people natural immunity vaccinated, virus's ability reproduce using people reduced. Also: less less people virus all, less less humans virus use mutation. last days daily deaths 19-27, cases gone least 4x numbers since cases would manifested themselves. means could looking 100 deaths per day 3 weeks. proclaim 3 deaths day...as wave doing...is extremely misleading. know many die yet, multiples ""3"" per day. Smallpox completely eradicated successful (and mandatory) vaccination program. 80% total would nice already see demand dropping regions 53% total today. 80% difficult achieve. People kept telling similar two mRNA vaccines supposed be. Ranging ""just branding difference"", ""identical active ingredients"", ""virtually same"" mixing two perfectly fine. article says enough differences make mixing better.

Just believe anything.  ""Post-pandemic"" considered *politically incorrect* terminology declares pandemic over. since involves state entire world, could take *years* that's case. Thx, read this? media intentionally omitting little fact vaccines, essentially trading death muscle cells instead lung ones worse symptoms? Vaccinated mean won’t get spread it. means chances either low. vaccinated get Delta variant, chances hospitalization death even lower, zero. COVID fun case even mild. wear mask? it’s easy, minimal inconvenience, one layer risks, use higher risk situations (indoors around possibly unvaccinated people crowds outside possibly unvaccinated people). Glad part MRNA race. pro restrictions masks somehow never got used wearing mask seeing everyone around wear one. always felt unnatural even knew right thing do. also tend believe way condition worsens

They’ll say “but said 2 years ago” argue call doctor dumb data literally changed diagnosis/prognosis Ok, thank info! can't afford take couple days recover unlikely vaccine side effects definitely can't afford take weeks isolating recovering covid. Yeah, maddening, especially considering people access vaccines choosing get it. Hopefully able get vaccine sooner anticipating. Stay safe! implying can't get COVID multiple times getting vaccinated?  know dismiss cases either young partially vaccinated people. cases greater chance coivd mutate become even worst. Reminds SNL skit ""Post Covid Party"" one guy said got J&amp;J vaccine everyone moved away covered mouth nose.  also breakthrough cases vaccines. know quantifiable comparison natural immunity vs. vaccines? Would love see actual numbers. facilities seperated Operation Warp Speed (OWS) public–private partnership initiated United States government facilitate accelerate development, manufacturing, distribution COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics. first news report Operation Warp Speed April 29, 2020, program officially announced May 15, 2020. news somewhere CBC mixing pfizer/moderna (second dose) astrazeneca (first dose) effective receiving 2 doses astrazeneca. Somewhere neighborhood 10-20% effective think. don’t really understand issue is, genuinely need reality check. UK far doomed, look current death hospitalisations rate even though cases risen weeks.  people 18-30 Mexico getting one border cities US gifted government want open borders bad, yeah, kind like choice also, lots jokes Israel isn’t bringing back lockdown. ruled today. brought back indoor masks trying increase vaccine uptake among teenagers, vast majority new infections are. Ok. masks, tiny island, EU, go it!

Masks OFF! [The flu shot offers protection flu 6 person get flu shot every year, best time get one end October.

If get early, may protected end flu season. Actually, no, majority UK’s new cases either partially vaccinated unvaccinated. Spread extremely concentrated young adults, got first doses access very, recently. There’s probably higher proportion breakthrough infections simply due amount virus circulating, doesn’t seem drastically higher.  literally copied pasted another comment his.

You liar, telling lies killing people. can't blow copy-paste quips. Right, Ad26 Ad5, remember correctly.

Problem lot Ad5 resistance world already, Ad5 used J&amp;J. Israel’s results indicator vaccine isn’t much help vs delta variant. Delta/Delta-Plus Variants (plus whatever new variants even know yet!) going disproportionately going hit denial mask-wearing social-distancing vaccinations most. 

As pretty much everything pandemic, sounds reasonable conclude surprised completely untrue year now. Awesome. Can't wait third dose!  Still, happen. Spain, Portugal, Malta, Greece already said support her. do. Pfizer says 90% effective. Thank you, take look Wow! Nice make online acquaintance fellow Bostonian! Thank god state openly embracing vaccination. guess we'll see Australia 2022 Teaching future citizens civic minded exactly short term solution... choice too. Trying keep anxiety bay. Yesterday went store. unmasked. Cashier unmasked. sneezed turned away. interaction less minute one item. Insane plague mental health literally sneezing due things like allergies literally anything random. Also, I’m fully vaccinated. It’s funny masks days security blanket anything. Oh well. know kidding, mean judgmental way, we're clear. vaccines good. Yeah, I've testing this. I've uncomplimentary things say china massively downvoted them. sub deleting posts want kowtow wants whims repressive china stands everything oppose, suppose that's business, need stop spreading chinese propaganda. Why?  Yeah, felt weird like twice. it. Yeah I'd get studies shown waiting longer improves response point I'd get  Also antibody decrease equal vaccine efficacy decrease, immunity complicated. far know, biontech % 75 symptomatic protection beta according qatar sources, also know %88 delta according PHE UK part EU.  Maybe NACI just... salty!

*ba dum tss*

God bad Oh God, they’re calling us J&amp;J’ers “people like you” 😫 getting downvoted like getting single type, burden proof people say safe. burden proof safe (and also effective). ""Better safe sorry"" means sticking studies say taking one type safe, non-existent studies say mixing safe. numbers better they're better vaccine. EU neighbors UK citizens. EU neighbors privileges.  Oh know assume 5 billion doses = 5 billion people getting fully vaxxed :) would like think people go first get second haha Even 1 dose better none :) love science all, shit giving whiplash! Seems like change dime, one day we’re gonna die there’s “delta variant” that’s sweeping ready rampage us all, next day I’m totes safe, next day everyone wearing masks again, even we’re vaccinated, etc. It’s becoming tiring!  thank majority world leaders this, Trump Boris two examples leaders platform take seriously. So, I’d rather risk chance getting purposely inject body, bad analogy bud [Pfizer highly effective Delta It'll reopen soon, expect, though probably requirement demonstrate full vaccination avoid quarantines.   **Countries:** want vaccine

**China:** vaccine home

**Vaccine home:** Sinovac school system I'm Principal already said masks schools fall. I'd surprised many require them. delta variant discovered like twenty minutes ago give em chance Hold tight, studied, goes well able mix/match boosters:   Aussies Canadians best drinking buddies. can't seem figure others sports though. amazed fast went back feeling normal wearing mask again. people took covid seriously thought would stranger transition. Source? even heard effective new variant find new article couple hours ago saying people received J&amp;J may need booster it. We've known weeks ago MRNA vaccines effective understand delay J&amp;J testing lab. others received J&amp;J voluntarily getting mrna.  Many young people work retail service jobs rely older people spending cash. Older people can’t spend cash nowhere go nothing do. enough younger people can’t see connection vaccination economic recovery, going long period poverty unemployment many them. Honestly I’ve always thought anglophone countries lot similar anyone wants admit. see 55k bill redditor posted heart inflammation? got donut though.  Yeah, share sentiment regarding accountability. many areas people resistant vaccinated wearing masks, also many areas roll-out slower, wearing mask would help keep transmission rates catch up. 

That said, would bad us virus allowed spread mutate vaccine-resistant variant going care responsible wasn't.  Iran made deals hundred million doses Cuban vaccine. individual countries contacted Cuba purchases well.  got low goal one, maybe two, vaccines show low efficacy. almost half vaccinated all. Annnnnnd they’re gonna blame liberals. EU vaccine certificates system offline digital certs something similar 

They yes, QR code scanned check authenticity app. Wow. Details?  first shot little bit sore arm literally side effects. second dose, got headache felt really tired 12 hours afterwards sore arm it. boyfriend felt tired 24 hours sore arm roommate side effects all. talking friends family received Pfizer moderna, seems like Novavax symptoms less severe knew three people (myself included) got novavax I’m sure people trial severe symptoms like moderna. I’m sorry harsh :(  fact unwilling use astra Zeneca 60

That changed literally today. 

Under 60 get AZ. position's bad world's vaccine production rolling along prob get fairly soon. 2.92 already given + 5 billion guy said

Do REALLY need specific reddit? Jesus..... too, friend. Except 

One Dose.

- AZ 71% protection hospitalisation, 30% symptomatic disease.
- Pfizer 94% protection hospitalisation, 46% symptomatic disease.

Two doses. 

- AZ 92% protection hospitalisation, 67% symptomatic disease.
- Pfizer 96% protection hospitalisation, 88% symptomatic disease.

Hospitalisation deaths ones actually matter especially elderly, symptomatic disease vague metric.

Not mention PHE specifically stated believed single dose averages taken soon people got first dose fully accurate AZ takes longer develop full immune would great. fully vaccinated, think needs allowance travel. many people businesses depend it. Hopefully US take approach UK agreed. feel like guidance keeps changing studies giving people fatigue next giving anti vaxxers ammunition. think fact we’re really hearing much overrun hospitals tons deaths good thing. might say obvious media obsessed months almost solely Covid cases. narrative almost one Covid case many harmful public perception

We’re likely going eradicate Covid ever did, certainly wouldn’t anytime soon. breathless stories cases fears fuel panic entirely helpful. Focus needs hospitals like first started making sure people get vaccinated

One question mark would variants supposedly one concerning 60% transmissible, point masks social distancing really work? feel like we’ve heard it’s worked last year therefore doesn’t hurt still it. It’d nice know effective health measures taken last year still year pandemic  efforts made increase vaccine production capabilities could rapidly produce massive quantities boosters, could also lead us requiring booster every years rather annually. still approved EMA, make sense put list vaccine certificates. Yes. Curbside godsend hope stays.  don’t disagree point that’s different discussion. Okay that's great idea fix problem, that's gonna happen time soon here. [That UK sibling well vaccine ordering good stuff. Thanks additional insight There’s also scientific evidence indicates it’s safe. You’re pulling data entirely different vaccine. AZ J&amp;J distinct differences despite adenovirus. Excess deaths probably one accurate ways measure impact Covid-19. mean science works. test keep testing learn it. ~~It first sentence.~~ not, one live-topic articles. bad. :) Interesting. wonder forecasted dates far then. That’s point though it? It’s good precedent set. Taking away persons bodily autonomy OK. Banning abortions OK, forcing someone take something OK. Doesn’t matter “its vaccine”

You get point I’m trying make, no? fully vaccinated. know fairly safe death hospitalization.

Just clear, mild case still end smell poop smell? Given downvoted people actually believe lockdown vaccine approved ages?? people get mad brought factual example colonoscopy part? Ah.. yes. scientific studies 100 percent every contingency. common normal. got Pfizer / Moderna combo Canada, myself. Yeah whoa... we're apathetic obstructionists Well true. buy air filter ac unit could last 5 years, even though tell change every 6? course.. could also, last 5 years fuck shit. 

It might depend relative risk willing take consider ""working"". vaccine! mysterious liquid outer space. Vaccine restrictions nothing new. We've smallpox, measles etc. Going bar club right. Getting vaccinated helps us society get better back normal.  blame stuff reported represented media.

Too much focus flashy titles, much focus telling people do, enough presenting ehat know, know, data currently have. Granted people want former hardly understand latter. Well, one point chose accept risk. could forbid driving, could reduce speed limits, make hander people get license, enforce laws strictly list goes on… don’t things 100% safe everything world balance benefits risks. people differ draw line. flying dangerous, others skydiving totally worth it. person ends choosing level risk willing accept (and kids). Public policy western countries typically err side allowing individual make choices personally know someone fully vaccinated, healthy, late 30's still contracted Covid. admitted ICU severe complications.

Good luck. Yes read article. exactly said is: conjecture. Looking past outcomes vaccines made entirely different pathogens different delivery methods speculating potential long term effects covid vaccines definition conjecture.

No scientist honestly say given covid vaccine produce negative side effects 5 years now. vaccines simply around 5 years, therefore predicition long term effects based science (as claim are) since science involves actually testing given hypothesis observing results arrive conclusion support hypothesis null hypothesis. 5 years passed vaccine studied period time that's scientists claim long-term side effects 5 year period associated given covid vaccine indeed case. then, claims end based conjecture scientific method. mean smell roses longer it’s bad? source this? trying doubt you, hadn’t heard before. Latter. day. course. COVID long become endemic human population. presence permanent. I've honestly tempted try get 3rd dose pfizer J&amp;J ( got 2x Moderna already) 'just case'. sounds selfish considering vaccine supply really issue, I'll take much protection get going fall / winter many downvotes too. say “oh well know xyz got covid they’re fine” read carefully find one unfounded.

Well unfounded exactly? What's lie? what's twisted? 23 often zero cases measles, despite contagious COVID. BC. wait province text/email us valid booking link make appointments come 7 weeks day first dose. Depending are, sites booking same-week others 2+ week wait, mRNA it’s seven week wait minimum That’s even extreme. Wearing mask you’ve vaccinated obviously overkill. don’t mind others mandates useless. Cool, thank you!  could win lottery! I’m interested could scientifically is. gotten first shot only, still reduces chances hospitalized 90-95%. Correct, know direct jump intermediary involved previous outbreak well one.

The best information regarding original SARS strain mentioned happens teach whole generation okay make mistakes everything must confidently resolved get go. 

Suddenly, they're thinking someone ""changes story"" means know they're talking malicious. cannot rub together two molecules empathy people free open access vaccine refuse get sick die. It’s damn fault point.

*legit medical exemptions children exempt callousness. think shows effective government mandates are. Ireland one toughest responses comparatively high compliance, wearing mask outside still seen weird. Sneezing COVID symptom.   free public Healthcare Greece. Oh cause pay it.  efficiency loss small even could testing error also Moderna said would needed said needed, make people happy keep falling fearmongering. drop efficiency mattered, would new virus different proteins. delta delta plus media scares. reason worry Vaccines Moderna Pfizer mRna based. problems variants, point vaccine keep mild symptoms. One mods one Facebook groups frequent talking third fourth doses Sinopharm. hear rumors people UAE able get two doses Pfizer lying vaccination status. Lots weird stuff going on. live Europe probably eligible two doses Pfizer here, probably that. makes hesitant UAE advises it. since I’m already vaccinated, prepared wait longer unvaccinated people hope “new improved” version Pfizer, go something that’s date now? mean states done better without draconian moves? don’t believe could contacted deadly virus &amp; know it🤦🏼‍♀️🤣 We're tree farmers crop takes 5 years start finish minimum we're used looking bigger picture longer period. surprised focused shitty looking come. I'm surprised many people America *do* want get vaccine. Especially seeing badly handling whole covid situation begin with. definitely possible, especially Delta variant takes off. One thing think people taking account Poland though crazy high levels natural immunity go vaccine rollout. Basically, socially active members society either virus vaccine protecting idiots older age groups unvaccinated. Vaccines MIGHT short lifespans, think they're sure either yet.

100 years ago flu... flu different. covid control, likely many (if any) new mutations. appears much less likely mutate flu - much likely fizzle there's way someone making billions let something fizzle type capitalism

They may choice. vaccine provides long-lasting immunity, fizzle regardless. Similarly, natural immunity long-lasting, it'll fizzle also. Many people still test high antibodies natural infection year ago. come UK cases increasing right now? thought seasonal virus something?  That's circumstantial. know unless tested that's really say it. Understandable, felt unsafe i'd get another vaccine. Im young guy im getting one friday highly doubt true. hidden treasure website internet get information from? makes think statement unreasonable? examples give viruses ""gone away?"" Yet somehow Moderna's stock keeps moving higher...  Bet would win too. US Eastern Europe? risk admission particularly increased **five relevant comorbidities.**

To honest, I'd bet people many health issues would hospitalized caught almost anything slightly serious... Better education start though. Better parenting would work better parents already problems can't. may take generations needs start somewhere. studies showing better protection natural immunity vax. think it’s person person guess say social distancing, may using wrong word, apologize.

I think family/friends vaccinated, it’s fine, agree you, going back world (shopping, events, etc.) require mask distancing. don’t think that’s small price pay.

To me, wearing mask becoming terrible thing much social bias that’s started, ultimately, anyone know fine masks, everything it: workouts, events, shopping. They’re completely fine. people problem ones beginning. 

But that’s discussion it, anyways. guess would prefer social distancing masking public continue, people option stop around friends/family private. disagree--when done correctly, work. almost impossible completely socially isolate wear high quality mask 100% time. many COVID cases spread close contacts let guard (people wear masks around families home). 

But agree think saying mitigation efforts really stop spread virus much. Vaccines silver bullet.  Yeah, that's exactly Ireland's goal is.  virus still new us. Better give us whatever know know vs wait 10 years super duper sure. We'd dead anyway. 

Let anti vaccine idiots get Covid. best way fight anti vaccine folks let learn hard way. wait till hits aboriginal settlements. Heaven help  Lies I’m 40 without spleen. I’m considered immune compromised PCP says things dangerous (those without spleens) bacterial infections. I’m caught types vaccines. mean thosr us covid (nov 2020) decided get vaccinated well (first shot may 28th, havent gotten 2nd yet still waiting)

If vaccine provide protection years say natural immunity? 

Im saying anti vax statement jjst wonderong people eho infevtion even needed tp vaccinated firdt place doses vould go thosr less fortunate countries need it.

(I well could wrong im doctor scientist dontt knowledge this)

My doctor tols gf get could get covid dont want that. Yeah, don’t quantitative values imagine get infected Covid replication factor least thousands. 

In terms PCR false positives, example recent study screening here: report 75000 individuals screened 318 positive, half became symptomatic. sounds lot like real infection lot like “a family member became false positive.” I’m disputing could happen someone sneezed face got sampled right away, don’t think common. 

I gather use PCR familiar subject; acknowledge background contribute studies I’ve seen PCR positive assumed pretty good signal real infection. context, UK's per capita hospitalization rate roughly 1/4 US in-line NYC's. Test positivity rate also low ~1% doubt lot ""positives"" asymptomatic breakthroughs see vaccinated (ie: believed viral load low transmission unlikely). Vaccines exactly supposed do. totally incorrect, news stories J&amp;J vaccine. covered often reddit. example, one discussing J&amp;J effective variants: No-vax Djokovic want get sick Cuba, choice third world countries get sick in, would Cuba.

I get idea trying say, Cuba definition second world country. get second world Cuba. Moderna 2x Im actually fan strategy. US reaching COVID zero pipe dream. damn big much interstate travel enough people vaccinated.

As long we're preventing hospitals overwhelmed, good though, Gottlieb pointed out- regional outbreaks lowly vaccinated areas. It'll interesting see plays out.  AZ vaccines?  Corona honestly lethal older/overweight people, dont fall category worst happen get bit sick vaccinated, chance slim I’m sure ignoring UAE medical experts seeking vaccines different country best something I’m strongly considering, it’s specifically discouraged UAE, makes hesitant it. I'll check back weeks see things going lol Depends company makes truck. 50% chance getting home, might wanna wait little longer one reliable, 80%-94% chance. there's truck coming, gotta jump Source that?

As understood it, don’t know jump happened bat human, direct intermediary animal involved, one would be. Poor kid. get kids vaccinated ASAP. That's it.   They'll allow people Canada well UK. Montana. Yeah that’s state ripe Delta Variant. Get one shot Pfizer live, fly home, quarantine, get two shots Pfizer Moderna. ;-) afraid lawsuits good reason dismiss woman's complaint. thought lawsuit judged merits, individually. “Very dense” yoooo thats mee Covid virus unique compared viruses aren’t issue? exactly think likely won’t hold true? Yeah pile poop guy was! reason 2 doses JnJ. issue viral backbone using. need use different backbone delivery viral backbone become immunogenic.  Sputnik uses adenovirus JnJ different backbone 2nd dose. 


Two doses better one, case can't get 2 doses Jnj short time period. Maybe next year use booster, idk. 

See article lancet essential workers 50 years age got AstraZeneca shot months back pushed getting Pfizer shot instead second AstraZeneca shot. Still, many choosing get 2nd AstraZeneca shot Pfizer one, there's guarantee they'll get want. friends essential workers. One friends get 2nd AstraZeneca shot tomorrow, he's getting it, problem. Another one also requested 2nd shot AstraZeneca, supposed get 2nd dose 3 weeks ago, he's still waiting, might give accept Pfizer shot. True, best vaccine ones that's easily available you. Get shots everyone know whether safe get pfizer/moderna vaccine youve already gotten vector based vaccine? want officially vaccinated travel, go events, umask legally, etc. Since beginning pandemic, 568,053 Americans died Covid. those, 287 deaths age comparison, roughly 4,000 minors die car accidents every year United past fourteen months - height pandemic - unvaccinated child 15 times likely die car accident Covid. Covid cases dwindle due increasing natural vaccinated immunity, probably grow something like 50x 100x likely.

There roughly 600 pediatric flu deaths US typical year. - thats twice many died Covid since March harder 😘 really is! Tbh was/am high af Delta 8 math worse complete utter lunacy. compassionate deal dangerous drug responsible many deaths. numbers article total population, headline percentage well, though wonder share 12+ large enough actually hit goal. need get everyone vaccinated effective, studied, drug approved. May cause problems line travel, etc. things happened pandemic stay forever sure. don’t know anyone problem increased take options. Even sometimes wanted pick food go hell home lol. Patriotism America seems word understand. them, seems, patriot shouting anyone agree you/the whole hating everything American.

It less patriotism nationalism. know, ""MURICA NUMBA ONE!"" that. ""stating permitting litigation could lead flood lawsuits""

Immediate disbarment occur here. lawsuit thrown could happen afterward. reasonable fair application law case case, without consideration could might happen wake litigation.

&amp;#x200B;

This case may dismissed myriad ways less egregious, least estimation.

&amp;#x200B;

Especially bailouts airlines received, zero pity remorse legal troubles. I’m super thankful there’s one done vaccine! know lot people wouldn’t otherwise gotten go back second time, including nephew mid 20s severe anxiety."
