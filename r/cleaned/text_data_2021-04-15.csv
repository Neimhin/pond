0,2021-04-15," Bahaha. Darwinism work get all, spread it, therefore care, least little bit people able get appointment, let alone vaccine, time required considered fully vaccinated. chance given person get die go every day keep vaccinating. Lots things kill viruses lab setting. Whether actually helps someone (who wearing eye protection, etc) real world setting.. seems questionable. don’t get you’re arguing nobody stating it’s authorized emergency use. it’s FDA approved, also thing guy states video. reason it’s approved yet there’s enough info, there’s emergency, it’s authorized. It’s misleading say it’s approved. I’d guess too..


But really last 12 months, India should’ve slammed finally passed Brazil #2 explicitly wrote 'private'

Also employers, except medical jobs, require vaccines germany example. India tests more. Brazil probably still limits tests severe cases  signed Moderna appointment rolled around Pfizer. limits this. mostly get get, definitely easier refuse try somewhere else. fairness according trial efficacy Sinovac 56% 2 weeks passed second dose (28% within 2 weeks second dose). still helpful especially countries can’t afford anything else anytime soon. actually disease January. immune system created -- shot needed. parents' elderly at-risk loved ones' sake, I'm glad could protect vaccine get back lives. That's made (protect recipients severe, life-threatening symptoms), seems working well. turn 2x per year shot. nobody going that. Getting second moderna dose tomorrow morning :) 
It’s speedy 28 days thankfully 50% obesity rate = ~5% death rate? Yeah that's obviously it. feel sorry 0.008 percent everything right still got screwed. “Isn’t conservative”?!?!? 

Brrrroooooooooooo. 

Their state motto “live free die”!!  Maybe twenty percent people wear masks outside neighborhood LA it’s “mandatory “ mandating illegal continue wear masks.... understand, I'm sorry. concern many people guessing whatever causing tinnitus hearing loss small percentage get vaccine likely also what's causing 15% get covid. Inflammation immune responses seemed indicate temporary learned this. apologies assuming republicans.

I'll think get back you. Imagine wrong anything deleting account Xlear OTC grapefruit juice spray nose? might start using it,. Well that’s moronic. Vaccines handed like candy NH wants drop masks now? 

At least let everyone wants vaccine get one pull stunt like this. It’s obnoxious badly “return normalcy” push done parts country involves antibodies formed way DNA based vaccines transport payload.

The antibodies immune system creates response shot, seem attack platelet factor 4 (PF4), PF4's job basically prevent much clotting.

Full details interested: now. Covid vaccine isn’t mandatory either . boyfriend's mom got Covid month full round Pfizer. Obviously mild case (mainly limited loss taste smell symptoms), clearly vaccines 100% effective (which one claimed were). article misleading, there's way vaccine 99.992% effective even. world big place - going stick around mutate matter lie, 110 children die year flu, 340 died COVID, plus bunch lingering effects. Oh man, forgotten that. ridiculous. remember heard say jaw dropped like cartoon character Mild. fever. aches there. Lack energy. bring Russian roulette talking death. highly misleading. Dare say, constitutes misinformation, even disinformation. surprising. high percentage Facebook users bright.  far understand it, Sputnik V actually uses different vectors two shots.

It interesting see compares vector vaccines long term. oh good lord....

how people like this? agree,its really messed :( Tinnitus   Would love see copied colleges. Sane. feel sane. health department, Walgreens Walmart continuing give shots hospital announced today ending clinic (so first shot, completing second shots). say point, county 35% partially vaccinated amount nurses volunteers hospital use longer make sense demand decreasing.

Local physicians area want start giving shot office due amount paperwork required believe would hamper office's ability see regular patients. asking every patient see vaccinated helping set appointments want one. 

There weird push part NC (and SC) high school kids age get shot summer go college work. idea bad reactions get sick, they'll miss even started person classes also things like modified prom, baseball games, graduation, etc. I'm saying choice would make, rather popular choice right now. Valid point, even though reddit hive mind, everybody thinks ""common good"". Point demand rapidly drying up, message biden maybe bbq July long get shot wear mask falls deaf ears people months, cases year. Btw get upvote seeing sides issue. think we're close effective social end pandemic.

Can ever get 40% never take vaccine? Yes, taking account fatality rates missing quite bit picture. Severing spinal cord necessarily fatal either - people would pretty pissed happened them. things United States Healthcare system illegal. Buying something without knowing price wrong. asked hospital much I’d pay straight wouldn’t tell me. US/Israel similar % people got think astra causes Pfizer moderna? Everyone town could vaccinated today wanted to. Perhaps local restaurants opened fully vaccinated people, would wanted to. That’s said “we thought” it’s widely speculated around 75%  think spinning facts fit ""but think children!"" narrative inherently morality data. hear ya. Idc either way. Prob goin get food meet buddies crashing family seeing grandparents tomorrow park! highly, highly, highly, doubt we'll ever see kind ""passport"". That's conspiracy fever dream that's around since announced credit cards. majority people can't work home forced wear masks 8+ hour shifts. That's bigger inconvenience one weekly grocery trip. Lmao  mean see may worried. information key. Pfizer appears getting ahead big problem avoid happened 2021. would try looking preventative perspective Cool! Send canada please :) It’d prudent proof concept. honestly, spread reduced first round, booster could knock dust. CNN put it...

About 5,800 people vaccinated coronavirus become infected anyway, became seriously ill 74 people died, CDC said. said 396 -- 7% -- got infected vaccinated required hospitalization, first indication vaccines protect completely severe disease death. Facts also factual FDA clearly stated, 2 months safety follow required EUA. vaccines EUA approval met that. 'E' EUA might give clue.

Also, vaccine studies MUCH larger FDA requires full approval. that's missing longer follow up. compared Russian roulette somewhat random nature individual's adaptive immune system may may sufficiently response vaccine. guaranteed non significant number us critically failed constitution skill check vaccinations none us know us not. vaccine? Why? Neither. Get either one. UK variant Big Japan! people US receiving third shot countries even receive first? Hopefully Biden see bigger picture donate supply countries need more. news Yes, that's really saying video, conflating ""approved"" FDA legal terminology sense safe, properly tested. tell difference testing official approval, EUA approval (can you?). way sow doubt vaccines. I’ve heard people, haven’t able find single published resource guidance. found information u/jrdz found, can’t understand wouldn’t CDC website fact CDC guidance. help super appreciated.

And thanks everything already done sub. wealth information really helpful lot us. Send north. 

There still lots people Bay Area want can't get it. What? Many employers require flu shots. pretty impractical people wearing mask 12+ hours day 5 days week. Plenty people *have* gotten without either carrot stick, though--I'm target ""young"" demographic, everyone know age group gotten it, part recognize that, even we're personally much risk, still need part.

You're probably right, though, there's substantial amount young, healthy people think way describe. that's necessarily natural default--hence difficult comprehend. one really believe common good--and plenty do--it actually pretty bizarre think that's enough incentive itself. think it’s getting blown proportion. formulating boosters order stay top virus, that’s job. Preach! Influenza excellent parallel point pandemic. Spanish flu caused many deaths covid point, society picked up, developed vaccines, completely moved threat influenza. opinion became desensitized threat *because* learned live alongside it.

Influenza continued big deal. Hospitals employees received similar sanitation advisories every flu season impact. 35 year olds catch flu live chronic lung impairment result pneumonia die. literally posted study contradicts statement - which, ironically, contains data. feel way. know people say “zero Covid” never going happen, mentally, zero Covid need feel happy again. Hearing news like makes feel like clearly never going end. miss 2019 life bad, hardly living. Lots places still bottlenecks people can't get it. 

I telling coworker today cousin managed get appointment next week another county open appointments live work (the answer Kaiser, county). 

The reason question coworker's husband can't get appointment county. now, can't get appointments. 

So maybe vaccines sent places people actually want get vaccinated? agree but, least me, weird seeing Europe extra careful year long lockdowns death tolls. Also putting trust Pfizer AstraZeneca kind European vaccines. decision weird me, way understand them, burning even money top potential profit lost lockdowns would’ve huge really idea herd immunity figure is. similar better Viraleze nasal spray? 

(Which £15 100ml bottle moment) TIL Russia European Honestly, blame media. infuriating little borderline harmful many well-regarded publications I've seen say definitively ""you still spread COVID fully vaccinated"" instead ""We know""

And yes, know technically people still spread vaccines 100% effective. everyone talk thinks this. I've talked many people arent idea vaccine see point stop spread COVID since they're low risk. Which, honestly, point view makes sense.

It's complete failure journalism, get conspiratorial really makes feel like media wants drag long possible. hope get definitive evidence otherwise soon made known. year hell, I'm unable comprehend blowing off.

For many people, lives never actually changed much. Imagine essential worker. going work every day along. still stop get coffee every morning. got two roommates also gone work every day. friends essential workers too, still hang because, see friends spending 9 hours day around people anyway, living 2 highly exposed people? roommates got sick sometime last year, never got tested, probably covid. bad, within week everyone fine. wear mask lower lip anywhere still required. Somebody comes asks whether going get vaccine. hell care? year hell. Aside able find toilet paper one time, living normal life along. Plus probably already caught it. 

Personally I'm like you, wait get shot get back normal. volunteered mass vaccination site could get shot early eligible. know ton people totally different experience this. People shit US, US quickly become top 3 exporter vaccine next 6 months. 

Taking months vaccinate citizens first evil, especially created vaccine production infrastructure also support rest world coming months.   hearing loss caused COVID, vaccine. get surprise dismay thread.  thank much There's official news boosters necessary -- making case are. 

Even end needing boosters, really nothing concerned about. flu shots every year long remember. _not big deal_. 

And anyone goes covid deadly flu: remember flu shots go every year many, many people get them. can't compare two viruses apples apples. yearly boosters reduce mortality, prior year boosters add overall ability fight flu, even get years booster. 

If COVID becomes endemic, another mundane thing deal every year.  feel completely. day comes government says need booster get events back. day give done world. numbers +65 fully vaccinated, Covid less deadly flu NH. 

This scares people. want mask mandates something that’s less deadly flu, wouldn’t also demand mask mandates flu?

There’s logical reason to. means either mask mandate illogical, they’re going extend mask mandates indefinitely it’s logical mandate viral infections. wondering going make mandatory certain activities get numbnuts get vaccinated.  

Just incomprehensible Duh Appointments hard come michigan. People getting vaccinated get second Moderna Sunday I'm stoked. I'm last covid bubble get 2nd except 2 year old newborn (but newborn getting antibodies 2 year old getting surplus). might explain NYC stubbornly high case rates even winter surge. know navigate (on page linked) see 50+ studies published 2020/2021 reference specific paper, probably trying interpret results yourself. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Maybe tell public health officials that. commenter giving experience. There's actually opposite; handful cases Pfizer specifically New York Times reported among others. Lol, course people downvoting you.

Sadly, immune compromised people always live bit differently. Big agree Source regarding overcame particular issue? Can’t locked indoors you’re genuinely concerned catching covid lmao Mate, people sub think know scientists worldwide. 

They say confidence idiots upvote. True. 3 million official global toll. think real could 6 million easy. 1 every 1000 people completing Phase 2 trial. Still go Phase 3 (so another 3+4 months minimum) could even seek emergency approval. Normal approval would take even longer standard phase 3. Vaccines going general public's arms 4+ months. yeah, little media attention vaccines point makes perfect sense. They've existed, undergoing testing, working far longer.

Still eggselent news, though.  Even walking past trail, sidewalk? know people making similar points downvoted here.

I think people fucking stupid... change vial 1-2 people? need clinics. People going right door everyday could vaccinated. Also get Fauci dam TV. asset vaccination effort many parts country.  US reaches herd immunity immunization

This already different thing top comment says Yeah, researchers COVID-19 vaccines literally used prior research make new vaccine safe. science works. take tylenol advil. dont take advil NSAIDS vaccine. take after, also prescribed daily NSAID matter take body used receiving drug wont effect immune response. mean truth that. think happened US. spread went exponential, like chain letters Ponzi schemes, eventually run people.

Everyone sees bad week thinks go forever. simply can't. Thats alot virtue signaling. get hard double masking? younger healthy, odds breakthrough case causing trouble vaccination likely extremely low. 0. Nothing life guaranteed though. 

If 85 serious health conditions I'd probably still fairly cautious (but hide home cautious) vaccination, community spread calms down. younger healthy person serious covid case vaccination likely small risk. personally plan still wear mask indoors (I mean, still required here) avoid superspreader type events, plan travel summer issues 1 1 time also vaccinated friends.  I’m pretty sure haven’t IV’ing vaccines. love ""live free die"" conservative statement least would able get vaccinated were! [95% former COVID patients suffer irreversible damage, Israeli study worry it. Agreed trying imply vaccine useless. wondering could explain apparent paradox high vaccination rate yet steep rise cases. Sorry can’t read 600k deaths attributed COVID. Sorry afraid facts, need stop listening Facebook. True, catching Covid odds getting vaccine, may even technically. still think vaccine go know look for, treated without much difficulty.

In meantime, mRNA vaccines great, difficult situation may want wait those. making stuff up? 

“Neutralisation poliovirus antibodies CHAT Sabin 1 measured sera 41 adults vaccinated OPV. Additionally, sera 28 children less 10 years age immunised IPV analysed. neutralisation assay poliovirus performed according guidelines.”

“The lack neutralising antibodies CHAT strain persons vaccinated OPV might associated increased risk reinfection CHAT polio virus type 1, implies putative risk transmission virus polio-free communities. strongly suggest laboratory workers immunised OPV receive booster vaccination IPV handling CHAT say.. matter mind. Sure fun trigger matter.

Joke's them. looks priceless. take pictures...  mRNA vaccines international effort, created US. Pfizer/ BioNtech vaccine made Germany funded German government, example joke never really funny gotten less funny. Well epidemic happening covid. sadly part normal 😕 awful lake effect may played part. Michigan area went bad winter (i’m speaking Pennsylvania here, 100% sure that) people previously shut-ins snow pandemic coming outside first time. weather warmed up, think safer actually considering lack natural immunity. Well, risk, sort of, issue genetic predisposition there's lot ""ifs"" covid interacts brain, idea would happen got it. studied there's lot people this, rather play super safe. 

But totally, try! got one shot second one weeks. follow money bet know leads to. think anything gender per se. that, especially Europe, people getting AZ 50 stage nurses healthcare workers, tend dominated women. I'd imagine data bias anything else. prehensile tail. Thats pretty great, right?  Crazy, they'd lockdown two weeks flatten curve they'd thing control. vaccine ever 100% effective. herd immunity important.

I guess got little short comments. reason cannot understand people want choose to.

I'm vaccinated btw. I've got absolutely nothing want don't. Iowa forced schools open precautions going well.  kids Iowa contracted coronavirus since January 29, date Gov.

Swelling inflammation injection site pretty common! personally well. painful even NSAIDs lasts days, good idea talk doctor. now, however, worry.

Interpreting EUA ""this found less safe full approval"" wrong. options basically:
A) vaccine probably safe, consider pandemic emergency

Hopefully they’ll order five vaccines next pandemic. tell difference EUA approval.

To get ""approval"": three phases clinical trials complete, vaccine manufacturer must present data FDA review team proves vaccine safe effective benefits outweigh risks.

To get order issue EUA, needs proven vaccine may effective preventing serious life-threatening condition, vaccine’s known potential benefits outweigh known potential risks. FDA said order COVID-19 vaccine administered public, including healthy people, issue EUA vaccine demonstrated clear compelling effectiveness large Phase 3 clinical trial.

So what's difference? EUA authorization bypass trials, review. fast tracked approval. Yes, healthcare system ""just verge"" collapsing long time.

To fair, however, big country current wave spread across quite slowly. current wave started Manaus caused kinds problems hospitals (Manaus *far* poorer Sao Paulo). Manaus far fewer cases deaths, whereas places worse state.

Thankfully, however, signs country whole may got past worst peak. least, seem worse weeks ago. honestly can't say disagree you, absolutely listen doctor anonymous alien across internet. 

Personally, would also concerned getting vaccine potential serious side effect. I'm among lowest priority receiving one anyway, would risk it? 

This article forced confront reasoning. put things perspective, believe perspective worth sharing. good article somewhere assess risks personal level. Like chances bad outcomes things varies stuff like age certain pre-existing conditions, along general community transmission rates covid.

So, headline here, would need compare also ""what chances getting covid *at all*?"" choice vaccine. chances getting covid very, low (maybe live island NZ something) might make sense avoid AstraZeneca since circumstances chances *any* negative outcome covid very, very, low, compared very, low chance negative outcome AstraZeneca.

At public health level, different countries already taken different reactions based particular circumstances. instance, fairly dense population high income country access something like BioNTech vaccine, might take approach abandoning AstraZeneca entirely. extreme, low income, poorly developed health infrastructure, lots people long travel times population centres, probably press ahead AstraZeneca similar vaccines advantages accept small number complications deaths far smaller number deaths much slower, expensive, difficult roll different vaccines.

Using average risk helpful. pro-vaxxers let's use average risk help narrative. apologies wall text. serious background article.

I messaging status 2 authors. initially involved #Masks4All, invited #CoVidIsAirborne.

That article written 3 major reasons:

1. Transmission Committee biased CoVid airborne.

2. leader committee debated two #CoVidIsAirborne scientists. authored two pretty biased reviews airborne.

3. vast majority world's governmebts' public health departments take cue WHO....and people dying it. &lt;===== care. next pandemic could already way.

If think came animals...we still living animals.
If think came lab, know humanity's rather horrific history accidents. 

I could care less started, ignore conversations started.

And go.....

1...................
Dr. Conly leads CoVid Transmission Committee, thinks transmission primarily fomites droplets (the big ones see coughing sneezing).

At last vote committee, 33% voted CoVid Airborne.

17 committee.
Areas expertise voting committee:

6 anti-microbial scientists

4 hand hygiene experts

1 epidemiologist

1 social scientist

1 water-borne epidemiologist

1 multidrug-resistant expert

1 infection control hospitals

ZERO aerosol experts.

The says consult aerosol scientists. I'm sure do....but aerosols often intuitive.

And aerosol scientists vote. Think that. one understands aerosols deep level seat table.

(I think aerosols easy understand...think cigarette smoke. Smoke aerosol.)

2...................
Anyway....Dr Prather Dr. David Fisman representing ideabthat #CoVidIsAirborne, debated Dr. Conly yourself, like, recording there.

Dr. Conly's central precept CoVid transmitted primarily via fomites droplets. Emphasized overwhelming amount virus found fomites.

He also omitted truth. SARSCOV-2 cultured virus captured air. Period. Lednicky (2020) twice.  one group...can get source pressed.

BTW, difficult capture virus air...especially hospitals excellent air cleaners (6 ACH greater). Typical, ventilation home &lt;1 ACH.

Think that! Trying capture built-up virus constantly cleaned? 

Also, far less inoculum needed infect via aerosols droplets transfer fomites. makes sense realize lungs stretch 50 100 yards...and constantly pouring air surface riddled ACE2 receptors.

Possibly different vaccine though since dont think AZ FDA approved yet. Pfizer spend two weeks normal freezer well believe. According weekly average deaths dropped 80% since peak dropping. Coincidentally, (hint: coincidentally) 80% 65+ received first dose. taking account takes couple weeks immunity fully kick normal COVID death probably couple onset disease death. builds lot lag, worry, going continue so.

Tax money. get money unless people spending working give tax money. longer virus goes on, less people giving tax money, course selfish interest get vaxxed giving money. people keep dying virus, government would get overthrown, so...

I dunno. different angle try hear excuse. Cuz we're near 50% Show proof statement there's ""lots talk"" making required 1) either get covid different vaccine becomes available take one side effects

2) vaccine may longer term blood clotting side effects we're seeing early cases it. good thing proportion hospitalized people already full vaccinated age range showing big decrease comparison othe age ranges. many cases (and new variants) young people increasingly getting serious cases. many cases started vaccinate government acted Chile covid free opened everything lol

Young people everywhere priced unfortunately sub gets brigaded weirdos mods could care less many lies get spread literally it. social end US lockdowns make difference. states basically removed restrictions March 2021 ""yeah, people die whatever"".

And results? wish like trump, idea worse is.
The guy said took vaccine could come crocodile Body positivity done damage care elaborate on. understand roots body positivity originally meant for, coopted whole different nonsense people say ok overweight/obese unhealthy, really original messaging behind body positivity.  EU behind many parts world om vaccination due low amounts available, would better gone US route vaccine nationalism. rest world glad EU though. got first Pfizer shot yesterday, looking forward second, they're saying we'll need third one within 6-12 months? get annual one, makes sense, third one year too? go hospital got little sick, whatever vaccine got (if get one) job. added /s! happy them! mostly something that's happened younger women birth control. think Merkel exceptionally low risk. I’m thinking moving US, live Ontario Canada. healthy person, like approach. always re-visit prediction different models predicting different things (IMHE says 2-3 weeks), cases seem going places they’ve high. 

Based fact increases northern states still restrictions, maybe complex factors lead covid cases going people deem “idiots” naughty? thought. think difference people specifically injecting vaccine whereas it’s guarantee even get Covid. number actually super concerning me, least 3 times (and possibly like 10 times) proportion COVID deaths children make US (and US definition defines kids 9 kids too). Hey there, got quick question. recently recovered COVID, 2 weeks since infection someone house started showing symptoms yesterday learnt positive. stay near infected person way, try stay away him.

I make-up exams following week, already missed actual exams. risky go take exams? someone recovered quarantine, still spread someone house COVID? wonder easily people programmed.  science experts vs obvious conmen upholding political rhetoric. think it'd easy win able get vaccine? they’ll fine. welp.. good luck getting vaccines, canada. bound happen. Things pretty much gone back mostly normal larger groups crowds everywhere. people get vaccinated, things really much safer. I’m going say full blown infection live virus equal that, yes. I’m going say “S” drop spike protein change hallmark B117 symptomatic, yes. I’d also point CDC, FDA usually slow give guidance. (I mask-er popular China Italy telling us so). take second infection something rare wouldn’t accurate. wish wasn’t so. many questions tested positive second time. Sunk cost fallacy noted that, preclinical data least, warning signs anything like happening. [Moderna's mice showed B.1.351 booster worked fine, [did Novavax boosters monkeys. Work Portland live rural bit both. Florida close? wonder maybe deadly strain, also also depending vaccine predominant may one less effective ones maybe. would awesome. really ever get sick get sniffles act like I'm dying I'm gathering children around bed side last wisdom. Yesterday, saw woman wearing painter/dust mask style mask store (the kind semi-rigid) firmly cupped mouth nose completely exposed.

The way kinds masks designed almost idiot proof oval shape adjustable bridge still managed wear wrong. assume city Tokyo Japanese OC. Maybe IOC gets divvy countries doubt it

I wonder NBC considering pay *billions* TV rights. Serves right absolute trash coverage decades immune systems need stop malingering accomplish mission. So? wasn’t point 

Novavax’s vaccine basically effective B1.135 CoronaVac wild type P.1. It’s using 49% figure isn’t accurate it’s using demographic really represents SA countries specifically high prevalence HIV. that’s something could really affect vaccine efficacy varying degrees Pfizer Moderna refused saying vaccine safe &amp; want tarnish reputation mention clots association J&amp;J AZ

Eh, feel like totally valid reason point avoid association vaccines encourage people go get shots.

Otherwise, ""Vaccines studied risk clots vaccines shown possible risk clots."" blanket statements frustrating border downright irresponsibleness. 

Nation States obviously taken managing pandemic little nil help WHO. successful others (Enter Australia, NZ, Singapore). Others late party seeing victories vaccines (ie. US, Israel, UK). 
Some countries elected officials daft proud care (i.e Brazil, India maybe)

And countries literally cannot manage internal conflicts worry COVID (many African nations). Literally hold value providing advice latter. Otherwise countries populations keep head listen mouthpiece. leaders act like politicians medical experts advice often generalized, sensationalized, late sometimes downright incorrect (remember Asymtomatic people didn’t spread covid) numbers agree that. Demand already slowed many places. likely story No, vaccines way out. people willing wear masks point, vaccines way. 

I get frustrated every day see people inside building wearing mask, vaccines probably way end stupid pandemic. Aspirate authors concluded combination case-based population-based policies, along widespread adherence, led Taiwan’s success containing COVID. Combining approaches led R number estimated using two different methods 0.82 low 0.62. also found considerable population-based policies needed achieve containment even though number circulating infections approach would sufficient alone, even country effective public health system sophisticated contact tracing.

Article continues Seen multiple sources recently 1% less vaccinated far. is. month two sub going able ride good news tidal wave inevitably falls cliff like winter surge. 

Except time good news may last surge thing following Spanish flu beat beat since beginning. Every pandemic hits waves dies off. Every pandemic. Never forget that. Bullshit. even quarter US population fully vaccinated\* goal 70%. Additionally, nobody 16 get vaccinated meaning children become reservoir wear one car I’m running around errands. It’s easier mess whole 5 minutes I’m car.

I personally don’t care least people choose live lives (as long it’s harmful community), don’t get invested I’m doing. biochem friend (who happens manufacture Covid tests) extremely careful, touch mask it’s she’s home always case same. 

I’d trust knowledge Covid vs random yahoo’s opinion every day week...so try get wreck next time see living life. fact you’re getting downvoted says lot people. say “if you’re worried stay home!” do, that’s somehow wrong too. alarmingly large number people decided they’re tired it, they’re going pretend covid magically vanished. I’m sorry friend way. I'd say almost entirely vaccine program. Israelis compliant measures. remember summer lockdown/curfew effect, people crowding beaches, gathering en masse holidays, partying illegally. There's reason cases high long ago time face facts natural selection for? getting different vaccine maybe weeks later.

Probably like 2 3 days average American rate we're vaccinating J&amp;J small piece current allotment vaccines. goddamn dick nose Remember, problem pause, lack understanding paused J&amp;J Vaccine. People ignorant read data understand risk big issue. 

We need better job getting people understand risk data. live Canada I've following while. hotel quarantine program monumental fuck-up honestly astounding canceled yet, definitely surprising many people refusing it:

1. forcing people pay thousands dollars 3-night stay airport hotels normally cost $100-200 per night. practice, difference regular stay ""quarantine"" stay delivery really terrible food room. many cases fine police imposing less cost hotel. honestly surprised owners hotels back-door agreements federal government given outrageous economics program are.

2. already mandatory 14-day home quarantine upon returning country, vast majority people following.

3. hotels crowded busy, making dangerous stay go straight home.

4. logistical disaster, people showing find room spend entire day getting fucked moved around different hotels find one room.

5. whole point hotel quarantine supposed get negative PCR test going home, Canada already requires negative PCR test arrival anyways they're forcing people stay 3 nights even test result comes back negative 1 night.

This one cases policy implemented political theatrics people actually impacted faced choice conforming actually intuitively safe rational them.

Also, hotel quarantine people enter via land border USA, true number people bypassing actually 200 quoted article. See unlucky enough suffer side effects, since mostly young women blood clots fatality rate covid 40 0.20% worth considering waiting depending lifestyle. woman working hospital retail environment I'd probably roll dice vaccine, I'm working home limit exposure people I'd probably wait. *Georgia Tech Coca-Cola disliked that* suppose Merkel keeps long enough may eventually work.
 
But point lockdowns curfews beneficial. won’t speak J J, big problem AZ messed trial, published data way boosted efficacy numbers questioned, rightly every turn.

Have lost ability gauge risk ? Sure. AZ’s business practices didn’t favors. Containing spread important limiting death.

Containing spread limits opportunities mutations limits subsequent waves.

Look what's happening brazil. young dying increased pace virus mutating (or really bad there, we're quite sure. numbers point virulent strain) Less 1% currently. I'm early 30s. Day second Moderna shot here. Last night 12 hours got second shot pretty horrible. Nausea, headache, chills, fever. Got 2 hours sleep. Woke morning still little nauseous think worst behind me. Glad it. No... I'm saying ""if shut grocery stores people would starve death"" true. No, going walk likely get respirator, people shit tons that. I'm saying easy choices government make reduce spread hard choices. easy choices ""stop parties people"" parties insignificant impact economy future livelihood. Saying ""shut meat packing plants"" would mean would longer meat eat. yeah, easier make policy stop parties impacting people's ability eat, even meat plant driving spread.

Every mitigation try use reduces spread amount. want get R value 1. try pick options reduce R value minimal impact society.

All $$ needs go vaccines vaccines only. 

The virus beaten us every turn. would might pediatrician recommended it. like listened recommended Gardasil vaccines kids got them.

Yet can't quite shake feeling maybe get vaccine. I'm decent age group know second vaccine get good level immunity actually first, I'm worried, curious it. sound like something happens? person incompetent? Even hosts talked everything like person talking movie. least time around hear Matt Lauer. Canadians

Even better Yeah, good, thanks clarifying :)  AstraZeneca becoming politicians vaccine. Premiers Canada getting boost confidence. Depends country government, US? Nah. People done restrictions already. dick-nosing, please! I'm glad vaccinated luck managed avoid getting Covid. However, cannot said 580,000 Americans died Covid. Nearly 1,000 Americans still dying Covid every day. acceptable number you?

It’s short bus ride. entire bus kids crashed died city years ago. Yet like 2 kids died covid healthy start with.

So going cry kids never get Covid? destroy reason living?
And didn’t say hit bus, said bus car accident. 

Car wrecks biggest killer US children Except hasn’t happened anywhere else. that’s “what happens.” amazing, must 4th 5th time governments messing around kind partial lockdown we've seen every time worked. end result always cases blowing anyway harder lockdown coming later, running longer cases control. really looks like controlling virus actually governments' first priority; care lot protecting sacred cows like keeping schools open, they'll toss nonsense like mandatory outdoor masks make look like they're taking stronger action. Right also vaccinate kids flu..... I’ve heard it’s equivalent chest x-ray. never difficult. Pay someone actually check travellers quarantine homes. Follow laws implement. 

In December, trip US help care sick family, quarantine. Nobody checked us once. updated status every day app. Nobody even bothered notify us over. followed rules believe public health. would problem leave house. vaccines prevent transmission heavily, would problem that's case. worst, 12s may continue wearing masks public setting help prevent transmission among age groups longer older teens adults.

 can't stand ear loops understand people use them. make ears sore help seal mask keep slipping down.  Well, guy real lazy. looks like Fairfax-Winchester 74 minutes...

There probably also lots appointments mass vaccination centers, seem follow strict ""you're officially part X group"" online registration compared pharmacies on. think people would WAY less concerned que jumpers damned vaccine. 

Let’s cut bullshit, lot Europe want mRNA vaccines... doesn’t matter point, expense, difficulty cooling stuff ... care. done didn’t stand fundamentally opposing views acquiring vaccines producing enough it. 

She wanted mRNA vaccines lot them, finally got numbers ordered expanded, lost precious time

she complained lack speed EU, really it? Ultimately abandoned alliance helped form EU sat ass, mistakes EU made ultimately accepted price „European solidarity“

Which think bullshit, EU would stayed together even several competing blocks vaccines, certainly remained tact last pandemic. EU needed competition, still does... already stated listen pediatricians recommend vaccine, matter? cemetery workers wearing PPE? kind don’t get people drop pandemic, speaking someone returned college year few. 

Yes think paying full tuition sit home garbage unjustifiable, get degree socialize lol. lot dropouts classes, dont quite understand youre going socialize anywhere else pandemic, youll year behind education. people also say quality education worse, thats probably due able self-motivate.

I think introvert though cause Id thing person haha. making statement. Sounds like could either keep current arrangement (grandparent childcare) hire someone. there’s alternative needing childcare, two choices. another comment said wouldn’t able find paid childcare could trust, leaves grandparents, you’ll probably accept associated risk. theoretically could, would get bad press unfavorable reactions public might hurt political party next federal election later year.  Disinfecting everything going help reduce risk covid meaningful way, spread antimicrobial resistance would say don’t it’s helpful way think, actually harmful way might immediately obvious sure getting posted now. Axios month ago interview did. developing booster end needing it. 

As now, looking like immune response still going strong six months in. Covid mutate anywhere near fast flu, may need booster may end multiple years need booster. Yes! Let’s go!!  Wow, I'm sorry people... effectiveness mean? far understand effectiveness reducing symptoms/hospitalisation/death.

It discuss transmission still evaluated. Nothing gets excited seeing politicians get vaccinated, scared, would wait tested constituents first making excuses! Really shuts anti-vax people point cases become less important hospitalization death rates metric follow. scariest thing Brazil even though everything getting worse, seems like people getting less less worried. 

I miss 2020. People actually scares back then, nowadays lot people seem listening incompetent president going parties social gatherings  Netherlands companies provide good working conditions employees working home, read rules strict. ""should"". 

This mentions rules strict: I've always admired Angela Merkel intelligent, competent leader. Yet again, disappoint.

Strong move, hope gets people board this.  know find funny? forever living March 2020. 14 months, clue politicians, epidemologists, experts oracles babbling scared tone media ACTUALLY WORKS.

Everytime cases go up, throw measures last time random. keep going up, measures harder.

You would expect would effort see prevent infections employ tactical, localized measures rip entire society apart every three months. made absolutely effort determine that. got used deploying lockdown every chance possible saw public accepts it. became normatized. theory, planes much better ventilation airports spread plane unlikely. even didn't, distancing airport still makes sense, still reduce spread disease would undistanced airport, free long air travel reduced pandemic anyway. feel shitty switch beer Big Macs. Much better you. I’m sure AZ try best convince others vaccines bad.

Seriously U.S. paused J&amp;J 6 blood clots 6.9 million. You’re trying tell they’re hiding 4/1 million. Yeah no. guys using see daily vaccines administered U.S.? Want something like covid tracking project. Listen yourself. Jesus Christ. joking right? Vaccination clinics empty days. recently report several clinics single customer several hours. Russia don’t even schedule shot - show clinic. Withholding vaccines groups harm.

It's amazing many people grasp this. FDA causing harm pause. People die decision. would know, kids don’t ride bikes Well, provider (the VA) made available patients early March starting vaccinations December probably mean SARS-CoV-2 vector. Kids generally get covid. Hahaha. try apply job degree phoenix University application/resume gets thrown straight trash btw. think late October show NYC likely actually normal vagueness driving people wall also toward nutjob conspiracy theories.

We blueprint able follow countries ahead vaccination %.

Early indications Israel 50% uptake vaccine take R0 numbers threadshold 1.

Build policy around that, tell people, reach 50% stop (small gatherings allowed outdoors), 60% stop (say masks example), etc.

If incentivize people mobilize. Even estimable [Dr. Fauci Biden team got started pre-existing Trump plan. Vaccines distributed well beginning year. Notice there's sharp increases graph: always going case, Operation Warp Speed bore fruit form viable vaccines. envy much. I’m sixteen Canada seems like it’ll turn around august/September though? Problems trials, problems reporting trial results, production issues, side effects ...

Compared vaccines especially manufacturers, AZ hardly making example. Mind ask industry work in? Obviously type job changes whether it’s worth moving every 6 months. Yeah rush There’s still better options here. city mass J&amp;J vaccine site changed Pfizer people ended registering lol Tbf football program usually pays itself

They may. Pfizer Moderna reports blood article it. seem agree hypothesis possible reaction vaccines given. see started sentence “Statistically”? means looking large population numbers assess risk, fine, nothing life absolute may one unlucky ones.

They’re taking motto Live Free Die real serious guess 🤷🏻‍♀️ Ok answer then. receive vaccine 90% effective, know 90% protected 10% susceptible? practice feasible way certain without testing everyone's antibody titers. 10% still susceptible depend 90% protect them. Right though enough people 90% population protect 10%. since way knowing, reasonable act 10% reduce rate infection enough people 90% protect us all. covid bad young age 30, mean you’re unhealthy likely?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  solution could simple ""make sure needle vein"" giving vaccine. Kids risk super low covid, need kids vaccines far know entirely protected death playing ""an immunogenic version Russian Roulette."" made death relevant metric brought Russian roulette. Common colds successfully tied less severe COVID. speculation popular while, scientists mostly given trying find evidence supporting it. People 30 even know buy stamps lol.  Yes, looks like 80%-low 90%'s real-world studies like Israeli study million people....which FANTASTIC!

The real numbers soooo good. mislead people like article doing? truth really great. Everyone chance vaccinated September. masks looked data? change covid rates based mask adherence. ""no longer required wear masks... **outside**"". 

You people beyond help. conspiracy theorists insane you, would understand. Look mirror.

edit: mean full blown screaming Alex Jones style conspiracy theorists... worst them. That's we've heard whole pandemic. ""Fool once"" that.

Flattening curve hospital capacity. preventing spread turn morphed zero-covid. means every potential time would ordinarily gotten COVID, you’re rolling 10-sided die initiative - comes 1, sorry, you’re getting sick anyway.

Way better normal, perfect.

But EVERYONE rolling 10-sided die, spreading exponentially harder, since every new patient needs roll 1 get infected. need get thing truly get back normalcy. ""new normal"" acceptable many people. people want wear masks volition, that's fine - restrictions mandates need end, need end soon. Unfortunately likely timeline.  local vaccine candidate stage 3 trials. finish vaccinations gets approved get first priority exports considering still hundreds millions vaccinate Maybe. got 2nd shot 30 minutes ago. I'll gladly get another fall means catching society's first endemic blood disease. vaccine roll NH #1 country mean? Yea. bad argument.

Its 100% chance covid vs 100% chance vaccine. 

The PR department needs go back drawing board. maybe goal convince low information individuals. countries' case numbers *very* incomplete Brazil much greater ability report deaths. Notice data Israel great, nothing like 99.992%.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's point. article misleading/misinformation. feel get closer calculating risk contracting covid grocery store, extrapolating risk death there. Although maybe I'm wrong. Math strong suit, clearly Ship Oregon! cant get enough here. People still driving two hours get shots state. outrageous thing article part, “State health officials skeptical link, although they're investigating.

Either way, vaccine hold nationwide family heartbroken.”

As vaccine hold fellow’s experience. think something voluntary nature covid vs baked chance vaccine gets people twisted. Although know voluntary getting covid unless truly want live rock years. That’s crazy man. one free, good thing country ever give people reject Nothing wrong liking it. previous guy said trashing unnecessary. prefer craft beers well bud time time. 100% number means “nobody trial got severe illness”. data looks good, 100% misleading. hopeful would be. wonder compliance like regard understanding people get yearly flu vaccines  Antibodies sum total immunity. 

Recovered SARS patients detectable antibodies within 2 years infection, still showed strong T-cell immunity SARS-CoV virus 16-17 years infected.  highly likely immunity SARS-CoV last years well. limit options selfish people, see problem this.

If come group lies, welcome again. world worked since forever vaccine virtually eliminates transmission virus. Something public health officials shouting roof tops. Wow. 25% adults vaccinated. Really hope isn’t trend shows often order millions millions US, that's risky outdoor activities largely banned (concerts, outdoor contact sports, outdoor dining drinking, etc) I’ll know stay home today! reason believe children face particular threat long term effects. children contract COVID experience severe illness. reason suspect children experienced severe illness severe long term effects.

This virus threat children. believe otherwise point, willingly ignorant. point, screw 'em. I'm personal responsibility sympathy people avoiding vaccines due conspiracy theories. Authorized Approved effectively thing case, consider semantic argument. trial, review efficacy safety, authorized use. Swap word approved authorized, change meaning sentence. doesn’t work like that. community protected whole enough people choose vaccinate; it’s individual issue.

Getting vaccinated needs personal choice, data overwhelming safety effectiveness. need identify reservations people work answer questions show data everyone comfortable protecting themself might greatest scientific achievement lifetimes. There's trial called ComCov recently started mixing Moderna, Novavax AZ.  delusional... think covid knows inside outside? crowded situation still air, fucking bad. Change attitude: You’re gonna power earn freedom. going tell friends reading headline. It’d great option us generally reaction flu shots, though. never noticed feeling poorly one, experience, second Pfizer laid 48 hrs so. Adding flu shot wouldn’t made difference. seen disaster housing market? Holy fuck You’re comparing number deaths total population. comparing number deaths average number deaths per year.

On average, 2M 2.5M people die US year. 600k additional deaths, roughly 25% increase. That’s minuscule. Numerous places VA open everybody - might drive... like hour? pay vaccine yet? ordered enough doses several brands population 4x over, one approved use Pfizer we're going use. spare vaccine give away. question many idiots get vaccinated already immunity actual virus. That's kind big unknown theory would likely get 564,000 isn’t enough you? know large number could avoided? start making money? I've doses Pfizer okay. reaction shots fairly mild considering. Reactions place basically nothing pretty bad long haulers. booster could combined flu vaccine pretty effective quite mild, might inclined take want risk taking vaccine that's going cause bedridden days routine booster. That's flat unacceptable me. Okay  Poorly? so? America first gone along old administration. don't. Work supply chain management. know folks medical field predictions place. I'm going gut sense nothing Ah know struggle. get vaccine already? hear mixed stories long-haulers reacting. you’re talking macro, i’m talking micro - herd immunity doesn’t mean shit *me* i’m dead clot

and forgive awfully noble willing pave road herd immunity deaths others recall reddit announcing covid would never hit India big supposed exposure variety infections shit. much theory sure AZ J&amp;J wasn’t women within certain age range getting blood clots? you’re demographic odds getting blood clot would higher

Edit: yes az it’s also mostly younger women, sex/age would definitely impact odds getting blood clot people NH ever you? Interesting. offense intended, work related research medical field? problem. I'm worried it, mostly curious. Haha thanks Small correction, cells create antibodies, B cells do. cells essentially *is* antibody receptor, quite same. yes, memory cells important, extend protection.

However, circulating antibody titers capable infected, there's value boosting titer low. personally think looking titers time we've seen far year likely soon younger, maybe 75+ need. I'm estimating current trajectory. get spread really local clusters only? perhaps boosters really needed all. That's hope. gonna worse many idiots get vaccinated all. honest, don’t - let’s part amicably never speak lol wear mask complain workers also can't wait never wear things again. Ahh yeah know answer question. outdoor mask mandate stupid telling people put mask back bites food Sorry it’s title article, didn’t label new. posting title like rules state. ten pharmacies miles me, Safeway, Costco, health care systems, Levi's stadium, community center etc. etc booked up. Everybody eligible 13th county bit demand calms again.

Ninja edit: suppose try calling maybe get better help. I'll give try. Yeah likewise (was sick months). zero interest taking boosters so. get it. get used reality infinitely better vaccine influenza vaccine need stop comparing virus influenza. would lot help situation. Think mumps less influenza. Mumps vaccine necessarily give lifetime protection give protection severe illness like 20 years N.D. (AP) — North Dakota health officials say number confirmed variant cases coronavirus doubled month warning possibility another wave state lab identified 79 total cases four variants, said Kirby Kruger, director Health Department’s Disease Control Division. includes 50 one first identified United Kingdom, 28 two California variants one South African active cases COVID-19 nearly doubled North Dakota Kruger cites variants key factor, Bismarck Tribune reported. would think we're programming t-cells attack known strains, booster would teach attack mutigens? know science takes time think need get handle much real-world immunity conferred vaccine. approach jacking everyone high antibody titers seems problematic.

One, people going it. hard enough get once, going come back twice year. two, actually know effects body. mRNA technology godsend expediting process, know safe keep body permanently reactive state?

I thought idea vax would give people ability make antibodies - we'd getting pumped periodically. bad round COVID took several months recover, system went haywire. I'm interested revisiting this, much less adopting permanent lifestyle. ""we brainstorm mask-bruning later.""  Dude got second 2 weeks ago. put ass day half. Totally worth it. Oh I'm sure that. I'm mostly curious need shots already got? Imagine lucky enough live country resources kind vaccine distribution ignore Wow, thank detailed answer. interesting maximums...  Still waiting point obvious. women affected (so far, I'm open new info saying otherwise), give jnj men. smart.  Wearing masks post covid become bit vertue signaly here. live bay area people openly post need mask distance next years people countries vaccinated. One dude know posts constantly reach mass vaccination threatening people less developed nations. straight faced called fact people allowed go Giants games ""act terrorism"" big ass list countries named....and got 100 likes FB... &amp;#x200B;

I’m Indiana mandate ended 4/6. businesses still require it, don’t, customers still wearing them. So, dodge without extra precautions? Right? really simple choice: afraid little vaccine, stay home let rest us non-science denying plague rats get lives. worse: ""We actively prevented anybody slowing virus political reasons God swoop sky save us results actions!"" way accurate... Sadly Simpsons quote though. uptake areas high vulnerable population low amongst ones risk, low?

Important know, stands currently, nothing stopping new surge later year rural areas low uptake uptake gonna increase. 

Especially significantly contagious variants and/or variants care natural immunity care less vaccine immunity. variant serious (for young people, example). saying new variants doom, measures, vaccine immunity level natural immunity, variants bad. know areas run, implement basically measures surge coming, like North South Dakota.

The difference first question important, means difference deadly wave overrun hospitals versus significantly less deadly wave hospitals handle load patients fine.  worries, feel trivialized it. Yeah, scary. I'm young blood vessel abnormality made feel kind like sitting duck. husband grandchild heart problem support past winter feared doomed. 3 fully vaxxed. 

That worry parents must hard. hope proud love them.

The amount people care amazes me.  Good. There's lots vaccine hesitant people comfortable J&amp;J vaccine mRNA. Disagree want, best way get shots arms get J&amp;J back market, convince get mRNA shot. explained well. theory people “infected” coronavirus develop COVID. 

It’s confusing think “infection” synonymous developing disease. Avoid advil/ibuprofen, use tylenol/acetaminophen/paracetamol. firm data knowledge, reasons think NSAIDs might hamper developing immunity. long canucks don’t lose Stanley cup I’m sure whatever happens peaceful COVID 1% mortality rate heavy skew toward certain populations almost deaths children. Yet vaccination something every single person/child must regardless already COVID not, even though doesn’t eliminate spread wearing masks till 2050 needing vaccine booster ever. Same. discussing officially Worst Headache Life needed hospitalized.  Four days life. Idk who's prescribing xanax, idk I'm gonna again. I’ve fully vaccinated month now. I.....safe? Like, I’m okay hang friends? see many people going without masks, feels uncertain IMO. prediction get small wave variants fall we're done. Maybe 50,000 similar bad flu year. Could I'm feeling pretty solid well cutie pie muah &lt;3 guys going science doctors currently telling us?

This sub anti science Well honest, point i'd happy that, think read somewhere stopping exports got shit together, problem population mass exodus cities going lockdown again. needs way stop leaving country least. Nobody etc. vaccinespotter, looks openings pharmacies, zipcode sea red dots demand astronomical lol lol'd comment.  someone lives France feel got seriously wrong end year hard lockdown. Instead put place inconsistent scientifically unsound measures. example closed cafes restaurants (except take away) kept open places like barbers salons many nonessential shops. 

They introduced curfew meaning people forced shop essential (and nonessential!) items compressed timeframe leading busier shops. also meant everyone remain indoors 6pm lead people going people’s houses secret. 

As measures place 6 months people ignore house mixing rules continue starting harder lockdown. 

A lot businesses returned office week ago told office absolutely needed. 

I son appreciate need schools open shut anyway predicted. 

The vaccination effort poor EU. overly complex get vaccine begin requiring doctor visit among things followed usual vaccination process rather emergency one. 

Also feel part Brexit relied much EU kind “see EU great” middle finger U.K. rather taking things control could done. 

France also huge antivax problem seems little done fix that. don’t know anyone vaccinated whereas whole family U.K. been. Sadly people know vaccinated refused it! 

Imho France locked like U.K. pushed harder vaccinations right Christmas. Instead went mixture poor measures nothing reduce spread fatigued people drawn measures. u science bud cases blood clots vaccines well development blood related disorders. can’t find article CDC acknowledged 3 Pfizer tried claim wasn’t true. 

I’m going say playing is, clotting risks 3 rare. J&amp;J taken mix hurts lot vulnerable populations, damage terms trust huge. are. I'm talking current ones I'm talking future ones. Also lose effectiveness faster compared original strain. honestly part says vaccinate people again. likely vulnerable vaccinated nobody else future that's guess maybe kids doubt even many kids time get infected 5-6 weeks fully vaccinated 

Not sure 5-6 weeks referring to. CDC defines full vaccination 2 weeks 2nd dose. 5-6 weeks first dose..  yes, basically extra paid sick leave: ""Compensation leave highest employee’s regular rate pay pay period leave taken; total wages (not including premium pay) divided total hours worked prior 90 days; California minimum wage; local minimum wage. maximum employer must pay $511 per day $5,110 aggregate (unless federal legislation increases amounts FFCRA-like bill)."" think hit herd immunity among segment population didn’t care took zero precautions. western world pause J&amp;J, can't ship stuff countries struggling get speed vaccines? Probably wont happen, remember global race, team. Prolonged raging Covid anywhere risk people everywhere. Fair enough guess. chose start getting traveled lot afford get sick. Also getting sick road really, really sucks. definitely seems make difference - I'd get 1-2 horrible week-long illnesses every winter, since I've nothing. 

Everyone know who've gotten one nothing worse sore arm afterwards, usually goes away within 24 hours. thought vaccines effective variants?

You know, pro-medicine come, people become anti-vaxxers. messaging place. First get vaccine order protect variants, need another shot every six months *because* variants?

Get vaccine, wait 2 weeks immunity, go live life. know. teenager 60s favorite show. question rhetorical one. Yes, referring to. already one thanks. Still daycare. data original COVID, variants. info tallied data ending March 1. link purporting variants concern directly CDC sourced using data 24 days past that.

New double mutant found seven days ago. end variants going keep popping many weak put mask stay six feet apart.  Vaccines wont save catch wrong variant.

Its longer ""COVID"". sars-Cov-2, b1.1.7, p1, etc. different. told stay inside was. Everyone sat around one particular ideology decided going politify germ theory lost daycare. 

Gonna blame Fauci bet huh. stupid? Ummmm science? Riddle hell virus know old are? 50% population already extremely masks wear begrudgingly. care town mandates ordinances. barely cared state mandates. 2012 publication date? get little feeling like pandemic. Odd live bay area restricting economic movement past pandemic’s end make able pay absurd rent. mask effective preventing someone spreading viral particles prevent getting in? Hence somebody might afraid person next wearing one. 10% .000001% accurately described phrase ""you still can"", people dont understand difference. Even media great job communicating, general public still understand everything always mitigating risk, risk never 0. 

If u ever hear ""there risk"", look size risk instead automatically avoiding Okay... government going stop acting like anti vaxxers pushing rhetoric vaccinated individuals can't go back normal still need keep masking? Yes does. appointment morning review bloodwork like every single quarter every single year.

I strong antibodies blood Sept 2020 COVID infection almost symptoms, again, rush taking non-FDA approved vaccine right now? something cannot answer it? Imagine that. Black people notoriously socially conservative, mostly due religious. 

I say though live mostly black liberal area. There’s plenty folks wear masks, double masks even, get vaccine. There’s long history abuse medical field towards black community, there’s lot valid distrust. 

Most points hear points understandable, rather straight crackpot conspiracy theories. example, one point listed above, “the government doesn’t make anything actually good us - free. don’t care. so, we’d free healthcare. trust care, now? trust vaccine free even good thing?”. get logic. I’m also frustrated don’t free healthcare. broken clock right twice day. gov/“establishment” lot wrong, vaccine something went right. can’t argue anymore. I’m exhausted. want take things political, definitely political social events made much (and much less) possible pandemic well. think simple. No, seriously mean there’s nothing around anyway. Iowa, people either go drinking meth. neither, it’s pretty lonely  studies starting come (it obviously takes time), looking pretty good, lot caveats due sparse data. least go toward ""what kinda expected"" route. shot painful, least really feel anything. I’ve implant years (on third one) love it. It’s statistically effective sterilization, apparently. previously Depo shots year, switched felt like hormonally Implanon (as called time) improvement. It’s hormones, doesn’t mean whole drug formula same, guess. article covid... Let’s point they’re comfortable technology that’s use two years longer mRNA. Masks magic barrier. probably social distancing, etc.

But fully vaccinated live life. get it, bad cold based others fully vaccinated still got it. jokes you. one actually cares wear mask outside not. date that's several months away. necessary make commitment going not, unwilling right mean much. 

Look many people willing get vaccinated compared December. value data period. 600k excess deaths compared previous 13 months % attributed COVID. Many deaths lockdowns people stuck inside, exercising breathing healthy outdoor air.

And look prior 13 months before, around 410k excess deaths. statistically miniscule numbers country 300+ million people.

No doesn't. facebook account, visit doctor today review bloodwork told there's reason rush taking non-FDA approved vaccine right now. I’m even kidding say fresh fries I’m looking forward lmao. clarify single household mean single person mean one family living single house.

I visit lot people live multi-family households, could see it'd effect people. brother said he’d get came house yeah think traveling internationally still risky something bad like happening. would suck stuck foreign country!   According people read headlines source.

This painted way seems imply vaccinated people 99.992% safe infection covid. true include people statistic, even didnt contact covid. mean seriously though...Like excuse getting it, Bill Gates conspiracy theories? want sound like jerk, get vaccine own. It'll really sad see people getting covid next months decided get vaccinted. fuck 'em, nothing else left say. know still spread bc enough data yet. I'm vaccinated still taking precautions bc children young vaccinated youngest whole host immune issues. 

There much know. get everyone sick this. too. want keep many people safe possible. “Who cares fact vast majority population protected, continue ruining people’s lives extremely small risks” pretty interesting, thanks tracking That’s wild me. seems knew fairly early mostly spread via airborne/close contact transmission. 

I know never want look purchase another bottle antibacterial wipes ever life. I’m never buying unless hit straight Ebola. wear 7 masks u want. dont care. Ill wearing zero masks vaccinated. 55-60%. 70% wont happen anytime soon. Depends you’re going internationally. I’ll fully vaccinated still show St Lucia negative test. Honestly I’m nervous abt fluke positive Oh like ship bottle! vaccine fade say need never ending booster shot. boat we? that's assuming T-cells kick protect there's evidence saying will.

And either way get COVID zero antibodies systems, I'll mild symptoms day two like first time, rush taking non-FDA approved vaccine right now???? Yes. personally pandemic over. chances getting infected minuscule extremely unlikely instance get infected would minor symptoms would barley contagious. OK let's focus numbers then. 600k additional deaths last 13 months COVID, even close. ""Who cares immunocompromised? want whatever want."" live fear virus unlikely die anyway, fully vaccinated against. Yeah bad. Likewise Australia every nzer know pissed expensive everything scientifically illiterate? Hieroglyphics. Yet UAE well Israel (or better). Considering Chile vaccination stage, expect daily cases start dropping end April. really started speeding mid-March quite Israel peaked daily cases. sure media pushing nonsense working yet one questioned Israel's cases kept going hit 68 doses per 100 people. Chile 64 doses per 100 people recent surge vaccination rate, means effect even delayed. Unlikely. TNG episode ""Angel One"" respiratory virus ship everyone taken except Data. Hopefully they’re compensated study, college busy enough let alone part study may require extra hours week let alone day.

The non-vaccinated seems weird, I’m assuming they’re willingly taking vaccine? can’t see people wanting take vaccine still willing take part study involves vaccine. It’s it’s peer reviewed scientific research. isn’t freaking Twitter poll. data Cdc publishing week.

Vaccine appointments open across country literally best vaccines we’ve ever designed. Please, go get one. promise you, you’ll fine. keep talking teachers doctors, they’ve able fully vaccinated 50 states chose to. didn’t, it’s kind point (unless there’s rare, legitimate medical reason, case exceptions returning person instruction). anger people like clearly avoiding vaccine literally zero reason Agree. FINALLY heard Fauci say something today atleast concrete. mean voice become irrelevant point touch Americans feels atleast set benchmark. 

He said 10k cases day less everything get back normal. mean hes wrong atleast someone forced set mark ""wait see"" goverment loves much. Michelle Obama already tried that. 8 years might add. wonder good chunk people wanna get vaccine. Wow, worse remember reading. Thanks. look like studies last spring hopefully things improved decent amount. *Canadian researchers letter published week suggested second Pfizer dose delayed given high level protection first shot increase number people getting vaccinated.*

I tested positive today. received first Pfizer shot 18 March. second last Thursday. However exposure roughly around April 1-3. second shot extreme fatigue last Friday woke Saturday thought cold/upper respiratory infection. showed felt zero symptoms received second shot. traced back April 1-3 guess exposure date.








My girlfriend had, thought cold, start last Sunday. assumed caught that. words cannot express awful felt last weekend. thought perfect storm combination vaccine side effects cold.








I worked home week thankfully. last night continuing show symptoms including shortness breath, episodes “brain fog” hellacious cough congestion decided go get tested today.








The urgent care clinic doc baffled I’d vaccinated still contracted COVID. wonder relates second shot. hopefully continue improve symptoms.








My girlfriend hospital getting shot today found positive. called she’d already gotten poked came clinic tested - she’s also positive. also wonder means vaccine sick virus. concern they're closing earlier expected based inadequate demand higher.

That's point, though. close shots redirected grocery store pharmacies, local doctors offices, etc., they'll still get people's arms.

Right now, I'd track appointment, I'd probably drive ways get it. convenient.

Thank Big Pharma quite bad killer disease! Im sure that’s it’s inactivate virus that’s problem

We vaccines based inactivated viruses quite effective like polio vaccine. Usually inactivated vaccines need booster shots though, maybe Sinovac would benefit additional doses.  hope you’re calling Palestinians “settlers” there... far [some variants ripping world need get children vaccinated Kids higher risk seasonal flu covid Yeah know, totally fine really care people think. kind ironic people scream socal distancing/masks name safety completely shirk concept waiting FDA approval putting something body name safety.

There's nothing wrong wanting wait FDA approval, full stop, anyone says otherwise morally/intellectually superior think welcome :) Yes he’s wrong insulting intelligence makes look equally dumb go ahead Amtrak model copy that.

Yes may grow third arm. cousin’s husbands friend HS Canada. bull shit. Theyre actually protective seat belts That's conspiracy theory. anti-vaxxer. said would Easter last year demanded pre-election rush science wasn’t quite yet Lol no

And didn’t even say doctor also advised NSAIDs possible know affect immune response, dying like second shot recommendation NSAIDs, lots booze, sleep, vices choice. side effects disappeared like magic 72 hours. Good luck! CDC published data vaccinated people got Covid. 

About 77 million fully vaccinated U.S. 
5,800 gotten Covid. 
396 hospitalized 
74 died. 

That’s .000096% risk death vaccinated. 

If you’re vaccinated chance dying Covid becomes incredibly small. 

It protects you. gets credit throwing money every vaccine see stuck 

Except first one got market. Get Pfizer/Moderna anyways cause it’s effective, especially vs severe illness. also need get vaccines India, Latin America, Africa *fast* understand risk statistics. I'm much pro-vaxx. Vaccines save lives, experimental ones. Haha that's blatantly wrong. Anyone 3rd grade level math please help explain guy Maybe he’s CEO Pfizer knows you? Where? world? telling world trying make sense. virus keeps mutating till shut across world. US 50% that's valid reason decrease supply. Michigan begging additional Billion people India. Sheesh. Accept false positive rate PCR less half percent usually. cases going businesses reopening, schools opening, people letting guard we’ve fucking year. anything false negative rate worried probably 10% due low viral load, people drinking water test etc. It’s bad tests “too many tests”. It’s highly contagious airborne virus viruses do. 🤦🏻‍♀️ That's true; second dose unpredictable people already covid generally stronger reactions shots. covid previously. first shot left fatigued eventually brought back chest pains, shortness breath, loss smell/ taste. second shot terrible 72 hours. Extreme body aches, barely able walk, can't-get-out-of-bed level fatigue. kinds side effects super rare probably covid pretty bad pretty recently, want people thinking stroll work day shot. 

I'm glad get shot never want get covid again, wish anyone. sick two months! Please get vaccinated worth side effects small get vaccinated sick. :) willfully unvaccinated going die. There's nothing point. And, frankly, fuck 'em. one blame point.

You lead horse water, can't make drink. This. Also Brazil basically 3rd world country healthcare shit everyone said thing texas too... That’s life 

And I’m vaccinated 

I worked times car road city ( major Midwest city )

But am, 38 ans innthr clear... speak newer tests error-prone though error scale proportionally number tests? depends mean best, real world data suggests AZ actually better stimulating cell amounts body Pfizer might offering longer lasting protection. AZ might actually offering advantages. think booster variants, know they're pushing yearly boosters idea. know current vaccines protection last 2 years 10 years. seems like cash grab, saw something Moderna wanting combine covid booster flu vaccine. Idk Pfizer make money. don’t “zero Anthrax” either. It’s another thing. Daily deaths still 1000. SMH. ever gonna turn corner this? Tell Denmark outright banned vaccine. Well shall wait see work around kids luckily none Covid lot brothers , sisters parents caught automatically leave school period time. 

Now none brothers sisters serious issues Covid. heal home quick recovery. 

But parents work long time long lasting issues. passed nasty things happen like losing limb needing organ transplants. One co-worker caught Covid never stops sweating. sweating since January... every single time see drenched sweat. 

But kids almost always fine. 

Just 2cents Meanwhile one site today WA 1500 people vaccinated. read either article similar article, presenting numbers article went say ""and can't stop masking social distancing."" remark comes mind think stupid average person is, realize half population even dumber. Europe as, more, anti-vaccination US. think we’re fucked. remote options, family feel comfortable sending to. 

So many kids fallen far behind. lot nothing, logging checking play games watch t.v. I've got kids coming good work done darn thing year failed every class first semester. 

We've open hybrid schedule 3 weeks 1 case. kids person 5 days week 80% attendance elementary since October we've gotten 5 6 notices positive cases. Schools driving spread.

You let parents decide best situation make risk assessments. Anti-vaxxers deniers force thread. sad numb *hundreds thousands* dead Americans. Like, yeah crappy honestly, nowhere near ""awful"". felt generally crappy 101F fever, side effect really bugged dizziness made prolonged reading (big part job) difficult. ended take day off, frustrating anything. also, lasted day. spike protein causing problem, expect problems mRNA/traditional vaccines 

Not necessarily. Remember AZ vaccine uses non-stabilized version spike protein, JnJ mRNA vaccines use stabilized spike protein. AZ spike behaves like spike protein SARS-COV-2. 

Meanwhile Sputnik Sinovac vaccines use Adenovirus vectors right they're claiming clotting issues (although believe them?) also around dozen (at least) adenovirus-vectored viruses various stages trials. numbers way low catch 1-in-200k issue confidence, maybe 1-in-20k issue? 

If cases JnJ clots show up, seems increasingly possible unmodified spike problem. Maybe there's another explanation JnJ clots (e.g., previous asymptomatic COVID infection?). Right (and may change!) rate clotting issues much higher AZ JnJ hard tell what's up, combined claims Sputnik Sinovac vaccines, makes hard say ""adenovirus vectors problem."" It’s hard understand someone could rationally think things still conclude risk vaccine exceeds risk disease.  E.g., ~850 million doses given.

I think moral duty stop suffering asap. Yeah. means it’s arbitrary number. SF might get there, but, don’t actually expect us get kinds numbers everywhere. I’ll certainly going back normal then, 70% not. God, that's awful.. won’t people argue it’s ok open up! ?! lkke they’re going let kids get covid?  said anything secret memo? make public announcement saying something aware concerned.

I saw article P1 makes 49% cases British Columbia. Granted there's delay deaths, think they'd seeing significant pediatric deaths point really variant.  Correct.

And, top that, authorities plan logistics vaccine rollout. AZ declined significant percentage population (however irrationally) another vaccine available, focussing vaccine make sense.

It depends country's circumstances, different countries making different decisions. remember AMA one people behind Israel’s vaccination effort, scientist mentioned current “vaccine passes” (I think used words “Green Pass” I’m positive) good 9 months currently, anticipates extended year.

It feels like they’re expecting vaccine sufficient protect 12 months, don’t want commit (or beyond that) don’t data back yet. ""What else telling us."" 

When pulled *six cases* blood clots *six million doses* administered. 

I'm even saying halted figure exactly what's going needs changes demographics get particular vaccine. right: anyone brain, ""what tells us"" they're extremely careful make sure vaccines safe. 

""They"" could done absolutely nothing continuing administer J&amp;J *still* would overwhelmingly net positive effect. Instead, *they* pulled 6 cases one fatality, even though effective virus killed *over half million* Americans within last year.  Touche. get Applebees like friend? No. demographics show Reddit users American. It’s conspiracy theory, it’s politics, it’s race, us hesitant get vaccine rushed incompetent fucking administration huge financial incentives rush vaccine development. One thing discussed much prevalence non-human coronaviruses amongst wildlife different continents.

I found paper several months ago 2008 thereabouts researchers tested bats Asia, Europe, Africa, measured many bats test finding significant variety coronaviruses. 

The number bats needed Asia much fewer Africa, required fewer Europe. test Americas Oceania, surprised Americas especially even fewer tested continents given distance Asia.

All speculation, actually fits pretty neatly we've seen, would explain huge difference India Brazil (although I'm sure age also portion).  nice! good point. forgot shocked first announced side effects. actually managed find one. bunch opened checked again. Phew, getting worried! ""Lost"" implies ability first place. state anybody get vaccine easily. would know got second dose today. We’re already 50% first shot. people still believe lol won’t ruin chances getting good immune response, no. However, you’re exposed day vaccine next day, could get COVID takes time immunity build — least week two vaccine. son tests positive husband gets vaccinated tomorrow, husband quarantine get vaccine quarantine ends — mostly protection administering it. Realistically, you’re wearing masks, even false negative wouldn’t likely pose significant risk vaccine administrators — you’re asked quarantine reschedule confirmed exposure, people aren’t expected act knowledge cannot possess.

I wouldn’t worry ruined vaccine efficacy — people without previous COVID antibodies showed response vaccine, remains highly effective safe.

Hope helps!  really can't tell weird brand sarcasm. check ""This one time honest it.""

You really make argument anything try hard enough person listening wants believe you. Tell immunocompromised people vaccine may work use [CA twitter Good thank do! Truly!

That still satisfy issue sending virus one family another contact school. Ok thank help it’s stressful studies showing 99.7% (from Wuhan) 95% (from US last summer) transmissions occur indoors. caveat outdoor transmissions harder trace, idea pretty much safe outside definitely holds lot water.

At time though, doubt outdoor mask mandate drastically increase indoor mask wearing, costs nothing. reasonable cost-benefit analysis outbreaks would support them. argument really want encourage everything done outdoors, main reason people would want wear masks. plan get vaccinated soon enough, I'm vaccine way. really judge people want scratching head people long time COVID COVID. however measles, smallpox etc. immunocompromised rely extensive near complete vaccination population deny diseases path them. Herd immunity.

What widespread vaccinations die early preventable diseases.  Really almost prescription drug would fine. I'll agree 2nd point. wish governors public health officials better job emphasizing vaccines mean back normal - think see saying coming months. believe able achieve normal summer 70% pretty clearly get 80% fall Covid likely issue much bigger normal flu. 

Things going change really fast next months response better vaccination numbers. help make change happen faster apart reducing cases, reducing deaths accelerating return normal life. 

A couple things Isreal

1) Normal coming soon, numbers looking amazing getting better. 

2) 70% ends quite enough get back normal even reason get vaccinated help us get 80%+ math overwhelming point hard virus spread. Given current vaccines training body specific spike protein, I'd guess depends whether significant mutations protein. Pfizer/Moderna vaccines directly derived genetic sequence protein. would also guess companies would look dosages variables. Pfizer vaccine 0.3ml, delivered 3 weeks apart. necessarily optimal, trial with. suspect they're monitoring people one dose people doses apart see affects immunity. body generating immune response! sees something doesn’t recognize, brings white blood cells. that, needs increase blood flow area, blood flow increases, means fluid going leave cells muscle, vaccine injected. get fluid area around injection, see swelling.

It nothing needle — means immune response working! Efficacy severe disease remains extremely high (10-0 case split trials). may worst vaccine have, would still end pandemic enough doses. friends 3 kids got covid barely symptoms got within 1 2 days.

Well that's remarkable, EU claimed 21m couple weeks ago! Roughly drowning pool dying. I'm actually rather hesitant take long covid anything besides grain salt. likely psychosomatic symptoms. Take publication reputable bit read bullets get right crux it: long covid clinical observation, patient-made illness. actual root medicine. might say ""well anecdotes can't wrong"", absolutely can, that's also well documented Asch Line Study: illustrates influence social pressure/narrative people's perception reality. needs kept mind discussing long covid, since data source Here's another article actually quantifies long term covid symptoms (methods data collection phone app people could list symptoms, actual evaluation physician). found 2.3% claimed experience symptoms lasting longer 12 weeks. 2.3% overwhelming majority age 50. common long term symptoms headache fatigue.

This dismiss concept long term covid symptoms entirely. long term complications associated many viruses already live with, there's reason think covid different, basis claim covid unique sense treated such. 

There's actually astonishingly little terms scientific, peer-reviewed data collected clinical environment regarding long term covid, reason think necessarily used talking point. Wow, link much data. % variant seems correlate current spike cases dont think taking account failure capture cases. Since March 2020. Ive taken counties positive cases multiplied 10 20x figure actual infection rate. calculations america covid already. Plenty counties across us locked without single case. realize football match involves tens thousands traveling ground, clustering together ENCLOSED spaces go stadium, also packing together public transport? states and/or local authorities holding vaccination clinics high schools get students India lying ass death numbers. friend (38 years old) got covid fever past 12 days. O2 levels 96% everything else normal. Unable contact doctor help mumbai.

From past 2 days fever 98 100. problem vaccines become effective enough things return normal critical mass people taken them. damn near third country thinks cause 5G Mars colonies nonsense. Reaching critical mass going difficult.

On top that, many global infections new variants popping time. one turns able bypass vaccine immunity, we’re back square one. Despite high vaccination numbers Chile using short intervals jabs meaning alhough one highest vaccinations per capita 'only' reached 40% population coverage. Still way expected herd immunity range.

And that's vaccine come questioning effectiveness. wrote brief comment explains number come sub-thread. might help explain it. numbers right, measuring different things! Interesting take. like creative things do. 

I hoping would see something like cheap blind taste/smell test quickly check senses diminishing. would say increasing number people believe pseudo science turn immediately jump conclusions there's something feeds narrative.

My country stopped vaccination AZ, however, many people think kill something (there false news saying vaccine killing people) would rather take Sputnik, gotten go EMA. refuse vaccine choose take medicine like ivermectin etc., proven dangerous vaccine itself. interesting theory, wish would explored more, especially also shown spike S1 crosses blood brain barrier administered intravenously, may partly explain heightened cerebral clotting incidence papers shown s1 (AZ use unstabilized spike) aggregate form complex platelets, see weaker signal J&amp;J AZ accidental IV theory might make even sense even though they're Adenoviral vector. 

This one reason I'm massigely interested intransal vaccine, aside obvious logistical advantages oxford vaccine Adenoviral vaccines trialed way right now. Intranasal uses less vaccine material proposed less reactogenic loss efficacy, chance hitting vein previously shown levels blood-brain uptake Spike 10 fold lower vs IV. Ah, that’s good know. lived Canada long time family’s still there, I’m touch past. Schools driving spread three weeks hybrid attendance. Let's hope stays way, bit early tell, it? Three weeks still within asymptomatic window.

It's cases students need watch, kids return, also family members.  Hate bearer good news, no. misinterpreting 90-95% statistic. 5-10% chance vaccinated still getting covid(even though seems way often presented way press) 

All vaccine trials measured chance Getting Covid vaccine versus chance getting Covid without getting vaccine. mean saying 5% ineffective. different number saying overall risk getting Covid vaccine. Basically, 95% number *not* overall risk. much vaccine reduce risk normal person walking around encountering people Covid. 

If recall correctly, overall risk getting Covid getting vaccine actually 0.04%. makes sense finding percent infected post-vaccine somewhat close 0.04%. 

I get complicated could confusing many people. different numbers. want learn more, 95% number called odds-ratio. good maybe explain whole vaccine thing better can. 

Another example; (While isn’t quite thing, might help people understand different way efficacy calculated). say hormonal birth control 97% effective, doesn’t mean 3 times hundred sex get pregnant (Imagine!). statistic looks 100 “couples” sex numerous times course year. couples sex throughout year many times, 3 get pregnant sometime year.  seriously people saying shit said natural immunity virus

Yes immunity provided transnational pharmaceutical products, allowed say things like ""herd immunity"", ""T cells"", etc without canceled kids chose stay remote even though I’d like go person. go school activities.

Sinovac better efficacy JnJ (it gives 100% protection moderate severe case, JnJ give 85% protection severe).

Sinopharm slightly higher efficacy AZ (79-86% vs ~70%).

More importantly, serious side effects reported countries using them.

Sure, underperforms compared mRNA ones, practically every vaccines are. Thats China process making mRNA vaccine. Brazil getting wrecked almost exclusively P1 variant really taken hold countries yet comparison. There's talk Brazil's higher rates severe COVID young patients there's worryingly small amount information P1 point.

So far seems massively infectious, potentially deadly, potentially dangerous younger people, able reinfect past patients variants, potentially avoid protection vaccines.

It's pretty concerning, need information  British citizens, small part rabid brexiteers mostly parrot whatever read tabloids  would also like protected children.

Crowded situations - yes, definitely need mask, casual walking street one around - no. would need every couple months? Moderna Pfizer 91% effective still six months.

This one: ? Okay, that's Covid-SARS-2 nose covered (so reckon). Now, Covid-SARS-2 lungs?

Does magically mean people use start wearing facemasks nose (like idiots already do) ? Imagine time taken given population country ( India ) highest rate vaccination 53%+ gotten least first jab also highest vaccination rate use vaccines available. 53% vacxinated already. NH killing it. think speaking metaphorically.  China Europe now? got wrong tag. definitely factor people know take AZ likely get mRNA vaccine within weeks. Can't even really blame wanting highest efficacy milder side effects.

Completely cancelling AZ JnJ vaccines though? Surely always find people would absolutely take risk themselves. even give under-60s deem risk acceptable individual level I've said many times before, Fauci seems like great expert viral behavior, terrible one human behavior. I've able convince people get vaccine talking able finally get rid masks, back read guidelines staying place. government data Brazil suggest 800 children age 9 died Covid-19, expert estimates death toll nearly three times higher.

I remember US seemed freak 150 eighteen died MIS-C big concern. side effects rare, severe treatable

Wait, side effect *treatable*? Hmmm... given rare side effect fact treatable I'm surprised J&amp;J back track already. I'm naive noticed that. UK, listed ""Deaths reported reason within 24 hours positive covid test"" something like that.

Even 90% inaccuracy, original statement car accidents correct.

One thing sure - people like looking internet never full picture, anything. someone living NL, makes sense make look numbers bit better... seriously, FUGG vaccines? Countries like freaking Kazakhstan Serbia (no offense) ahead us vaccinations. Variant strains - would prefer lockdowns and/or catching mutant Covid? worse that. know people jave familyembers die get vaccine. literally claim hoax lay dying it. CDC slow fuck. Inflammation process part developing antibodies immunity. Lowering cox2 enzymes promote immune response common sense. Taking acetominophen/NSAIDs case vaccination taken upper range fever can’t sleep. Reasonable. need boosters tetanus shots.

If everyone would part get first shots, need them. is, unfortunately.

Once anti-vaxxers die recover, may need boosters, then, makes sense. friend wants attend dinner party literally 5 days gets first dose argues bullies refused.  pandemic destroyed one friendship. related peer reviewed Norway: patients 130 000 people vaccinated far. Predominantly hospital staff likes (since beginning, AZ recommended people 65 Norway), means ""younger"" people. 3 5 died. still rare events (and expert enough judge likely causality is), statistics quite different 37 17 million mentioned Independent article. close truth remains seen guess. know 5 cases found 130 000 population 5 identified particular study.

If factor countries significantly less virus spread (ie lower risk infection) taking AZ vaccine program delay overall program much end, think decision understandable. might case entire country open eligibility days US. last months case. think month ago UK still higher vaccination rate US, demand US already drying up. lot states opened eligibility earlier. due supply, lack demand. story subreddit recently talked rural counties already lacking demand opening eligibility already planning shut vaccination sites.

The US could run system would enough demand. sure urban places enough demand this, places US appointments still hard come by. reality probably US enough vaccine demand places, especially combined vaccine supply. already happening 37% population vaccinated, at, let's say, 2.4% population vaccinated Brazil, huge problem. US number new cases per day patterns number adult COVID cases, haphazard decline. peak MIS-C US January. 

So comment way accuracy. Israel vaccinated roughly twice many Chile.

In first week vaccination, chances catching Covid doubles. probably due fact people start going around way early.

Israel 20 new cases yesterday, pandemic them. opinion, covid vaccine use technology used vaccines deadly diseases like measles, polio, TB, would need one shot eventually booster decade.

Still waiting post something, anything...... one largest donors per capita 2020 Yup  idiot Well deserving? think anyone deserves get covid 54321 can’t much longer till one super liberal blind subs delete post bullshit know it. question never whether Indian's would get infected not. severely virus would attack them. healthcare systems far collapsing. daily 200,000 cases, I'm sure 80-90% asymptomatic low fever. 'supposed exposure variety infections shit'. Hope clear now. Yeah, country also really high uptake, still 70-79 group, sometimes envy e.g. Russians, basically able get vaccine months regardless age due people wanting caring.

I guess high uptake good long run, even selfish perspective. Countries like Russia hard time controlling virus low uptake. impatience get vaccine feel safer real, though!  also US vaccine supply coming sooner UK? know enough doses available everyone coming soon US need prioritize anymore, UK quite many someone wait long time, they'd rather youngest group. True. Trump admin great job making sure contracts place vaccines. Expect admin. I’ll tell now! vaccinated!! kids get around 94% ok according cdc. FUCK MATTER KIDS vaccinated?!!!!! cannot vaccinate kids based age. vaccine good say shouldn’t matter around mask mask. Get yourselves. Teachers posturing selfish lazy point. disagree ask 9o% parents tell thing. news mandate lift. real news Israel going ten thousand cases day 20. 

After vaccinating nearly everybody, pandemic Israel over. ""It contain metal particles"" scare people swear colloidal silver panacea one pick one, Pfizer right choice, doubt.

They also plan B, though. learned kind thing fail... Getting hospitalized covid already rare getting type specific brain blood clot still rare. Blood clots general problem case, specific type blood clot. I'm trying downplay Covid dangerous I'm also trying downplay blood clots risks lose perspective actual chances happening.

I’m stupid antivaxxer health organisation hell. waited yearly shot kid 3 hours, nurse tell turn don’t vaccine me. legit pissed then, 10x times pissed chores life. False positives way useful false negatives though think picture sucks People Asian descent West die covid similar rates White people, think so. remember people holding India exemplary actions combat Covid, low reported case-numbers. context criticizing US something like: ""See? Even poor country like India way better job US"". US terrible job considering wealth, claim country like India rampant poverty, high population density totally insufficient healthcare even good times time global champion keeping actual case numbers low absurd. US countries conduct 5-10x number Covid tests per capita, always omitted comparisons. flu virtually disappeared outside Asia, probably due quarantines restricted air travel. places stopped flu vaccines except covid completely reported. Note one simply old age. 

Also quoting US stats covid circle jerk post - I’m US. Look Israel chart. vaccinating almost everybody, went daily 10000 cases, 20.

The pandemic Israel over.

This could even better persuader free beer. Ivanka Trump got shot. look lose faith humanity. Honestly nice see im alone this. shivering freaked most. 

Im feeling little better waking up, definitely feel like im getting flu cold. realistically really can’t know vaccine going take.You guess literally downplaying fact 1,35 million people die traffic accident every year? dare you. utterly abominable person. People DYING. Unfortunately, everyone strong wonderful am, live indefinite isolation confinement without wanting fucking shoot themselves. kids almost always fine.

That’s experience well. wife classroom teacher daughter middle school. them, know lot families kids. We’ve probably know friends know two dozen kids tested positive. either mild symptoms shocked test positive asymptomatic. except one. 16-year-old male athlete. Prime health, conditions, can’t shake virus. He’s going week seven symptoms. severe, enough put hospital, damn thing won’t go away. It’s exhausting wearing down. feel bad parents worried sick. 

I wish vaccine authorization adolescents lined better increasing vaccine availability. know nothing perfect, it’s long wait get kid vaccinated. Funny happening vaccinations going 50% population mark.

I would tell think, apparently dangerous get excommunicated days let ponder, pay these? Children survived Spanish flu 1918-1920 still immunity pretty much would able achieve abundance resources. Scarcity today's age myth. time earn money huh Hundreds thousands marched, protested, rioted summer long support BLM country. Nobody socially distanced, wear masks. However, time n94 masks still short supply impossible find stores diverted healthcare workers. Indeed, photos protests show almost one wearing masks. wore surgical masks, cloth masks, bandannas gaiters. Despite gathering crowds wearing masks claim less effective, outbreaks associated protests. Scientists attributed lack spread masking, even though weren’t “right” kinds masks.

Follow science. Karikó's co-publisher American named Drew Weissman. ""Lets start news chart Israel. see, 10000 new daily cases two months ago. vaccinating almost everybody, yesterday 20.""

Last checked every area Canada vaccinated &lt;30% people first dose. articles cites 21% British Columbia ""Don't make mistake"".....you realize Japanese government? call advice (if case, vaccinations would pace finish century out. (they nearly thousand people yesterday!)
I'm saying heard ""just wait, mountains bodies coming, time really it, unstoppable now"" year now. Nothing case I'm doing. cases rise (we couple dozen prefecture), uni go back online, I'm already going places unnecessarily. mention clustering inside bars/restaurants game. There's always big indoor component ""outdoor"" superspreader events. would lockdowns table everybody wants vaccine get one? 7 years, precise? Thank god. comment often here: seems journalists ""experts"" really desperately hoping vaccination fail. really dread longer center attention.

There hardly Brazil style catastrophe happening Chile right now, look statistics among people actually vaccinated, working way should.

Deaths cases fall immediately: ""see, vaccines might work"" 
Deaths cases fall drastically UK ""it actually lockdown""

Who really anti vaxx people here? everybody wants vaccine get one would life different normal?

We restrictions vaccine exist. does. Surprised anyone? happy chose go, saw irresponsiblity TV maskholes. Suppose buy tickets bug concert Miami June..... sure though Mania actually sold socially distanced seats ppl looked top other. concert sold socially distanced seats. vaccine cause clots? Pfizer similar rate AZ according study found headline news. Pfizer better suppressing bad press.  Same.

Got Moderna 2 last week gonna convince gonna worse *for me* 2012 flu, last time got flu shot.

I 2 decades COVID coming back radar. still get virus vaccinated

And severity common cold even less. Nothing worth caring about. really depends location. city's density around 1500 people/km2 one visited cities country. However, would shocked person every 5 meters radius, wear mask. lot biking city struggle get closer 2 meters someone seconds. 
I'd understand main streets. main street quite crowded sometimes, rest city winter mode. Pretty disturbing they've identified South African variant, given small population is. Probably significant thing COVID prevalence population - AZ worth risk high prevalence areas low prevalence areas (where vaccines available bit later (before autumn surge). Facepalm... dont know shit.. 30s. women. government guidance says won’t given “where possible” right? I’ve seen multiple people past days socials 30 get first dose AZ vaccine. Must available chose get it? country US approach vaccinating politicians leaders first? U.K., Johnson also got jab turn. Even Queen got month second priority group (after care home residents carers). France.  said idea lot companies going make vaccine viable. particularly surprising Pfizer big winner probably distributing whole world within year come version stored fridge getting bit ridiculous. Enough enough.

Japan higher covid rates UK. UK 60%+ adults vaccinated. Yet summer harbour festival July city cancelled still hard predict situation then. 

I know foreign spectators allowed still, utterly farcical suggest Japan going able host games.

When admit fantasy over. agree. won’t know long immunity two shots natural infection last time elapsed, you’d think one year. big issue next years variants break vaccine immunity. years there’s worldwide immunity fewer variants popping probably wouldn’t update vaccine get boosters often. aren’t many things life 99.99% effective I'm saying, no. top end, 90% efficacy frickin' amazing. Better really reason hope for, tbh.

I mean, guess depends definition ""significant"". pfizer trial, example, 9 cases covid infection among 18,000 vaccinated people, compared 162 number received placebo. numbers appear little better things shaking ""real world"" studies new variants, though hugely. recent CDC study tested participants regardless symptoms still found 90% efficacy, meaning vaccines protecting symptomatic covid, protecting covid full stop.

Is helpful? 99.992% efficacy necessarily vaccine. Remember trials vaccine returned 90-95%. Obviously need social distance vaccinated, plenty people still mandates whatnot. vast majority people vaccinated yet. obvious social distance would ridiculous continue forever. Wow [just commented ""what children, care children!?"" going become next rallying cry even cases get really low like are. smart love it. won’t automatic. Variants still mutate large reservoirs available. daughter's nanny conservative Cuban family south Florida they're skeptical vaccine, wife got told free, much safer feel, protecting people love etc. changed mind going get too! Hopefully convince rest family well. make difference people try. Republicans effects know someone got themselves... going happen eventually one community gets vaccine guess that's good thing gonna take long time happen everyone. vaccine going 100% effective anything. *significantly reduces* likelihood getting severely ill hospitalized COVID, can't completely prevent it. number people already infected getting vaccinations proves definitely 100% effective preventing virus all. second Pfizer shot knocked ass next day. 102 fever could barely stand pee without needing rest. woke next day perfectly fine. also drank shit ton water didn’t seem help. least even though might suck haven’t heard lasting longer day two! wonder many disease transmissions prevented regular hand washing surface disinfection. sceptical curfews Bavaria couple weeks earlier year. actually stop meeting people supposed home 9 what's point meeting someone evening home hour later so.
Nevertheless, closing schools enforcing WFH (why thing?) would help much more. I've working home year I'm deprived private social interaction. lots friends still go office either boss wants workplace incompetent video calls. yet, sir drinks semen. Please let us know works you. get first shot 27th (Switzerland). Curfews pointless. guess virus active late night. Gold standard handling pandemic effectively? hell hear that? people refer others bud haha 50 population vaccinated 50 isn’t, expect? It’s like don’t actually believe vaccines. Dodged Covid... grew another toe Yeah, arguing that. saying disconnect you, individual, safety, someone advising public health capacity currently recommend. bad they'll read call propaganda. Fucker Carlson blame alot mistrust IMO. UK they've putting resources convincing vaccine hesitant high risk groups apparently fair amount success. Nothing wrong hydrated ;) stops kidney stones least keep hydrated! Everyone want always hydrated reason alone! fully vaccinated girlfriend’s fully vaccinated mom flew town visit us, went eat outdoors lot. that, much different before. 

It’s extra annoying I’ve working full time Doordash driver since June, higher risk lot population, I’ve extra careful working managed stay healthy. haven’t even working much past 2 weeks I’ve got another job lined up. almost fully vaccinated people immune spread virus.

What source this? exact opposite everything I've heard public health officials. Everything I've heard says likelihood catching COVID reduced significantly, enough evidence say sure whether significant risk comes passing onto others, enough infections vaccinated people dubious claim ""almost fully vaccinated people immune."" That's me...as adult still.. Haha skipped joyfully get vaccine. Normally get chocolate make shots hahaha. 99.992% efficacy necessarily vaccine. Remember trials returned 90-95%. Obviously need social distance vaccinated, plenty people need so. fair there’s also whole 5G trackers Bill Gates side things consider. I'm little surprised made Ars given shaky math is. commentors tried back envelope math address this. 
  
johnadams2015 that's really calculate vaccine efficacy. ""5800 cases 75 million vaccinated"" indeed 99.992% uh... compare 5800 cases compared expected number cases get similar population 75 million people time. Even back envelope calculations see:
 million non-vaccinated cases/day last 2 months 4.8 million cases)
 75 million people get something like 1.4 million cases equivalent time, giving vaccine efficacy 99.6%. That's still back envelope, *lot* closer accurate ????? comparison story author did. loop here? thought voting compulsory Brazil?

Edit: typo live West Michigan it’s dumpster fire. she’s playing kiss ass politics, hospitals full younger sicker patients. Schools pretending unvaccinated kids don’t spread virus school based 2020 data cases low, there’s f2f school sports. Lots kids hospitalized. I’m nurse- left hospital January outpatient job, hear friends, it’s bad. kids home, staying home. Everyone 16 vaccinated. littles get vaccinated becomes available- something change. Even wait month get another vaccination risk dying disease much higher astronomically small reduction side effects? mean vaccines around since December data vaccines immunity 5 months. include trial period maybe 6-7 months.

But vaccines provide protection years. Even variants mutations likely get protection. vaccines given (maybe booster) kids never again. really mechanism immune system cause ""forget"" immunity 6 months.

These concerns immunity somehow fade 6 12 months completely overblown opinion. literally data support it. something else worry like worrying guess. Even without vaccine virus would circulate infect hosts became endemic. several highly effective vaccines process vaccination combined natural immunity expedite process getting lower levels infection death. I’m sick catasrophizing. get it’s cathartic vocalize end world amongst anxious parties Jesus Christ. Unless I’m missing something big, impression voting actually compulsory Brazil (albeit fine small don’t vote) agree people ""faking it"", now. come late May USA shots available on-demand anyone wants one, argument going tough sell me. I'm awake enough numbers based changing rates vaccination bad take math.

Lets say vaccination started December-ish. 20.5 million coronavirus cases January 1, 2021. Today 32 million. 11.5 million new cases. 75 million vaccinated population 330 million, 255 million unvaccinated. that's 4.5% unvaccinated population infected time. 

again, math way accurate since 75 million people get vaccinated once, best ballpark Yes That’s good! Mine knows it’s one step closer wearing masks time anymore. hates shots, last time needed boosters, took nurse hold still another nurse pokes! traumatic, went ice cream lol Getting vaccine Wednesday restored faith humanity least humanity state many people itching bit get it. Heard it’s like days go probably summer. Even though lines long, way things handled fluid. I’m reassured people live side state trying get vaccine weeks things started rolling wonder drive 3+ hours back would worth making mass vaccination event closer us worth it.

Vaccines might exist widely available everywhere yet. states even available everyone yet, still facing long waiting times appointments. See thread. Cases florida husband's work PTO freeze stop spread shop. Also, kids (under 12) visiting vaccinated parents feel comfortable us coming high infection place stupid logic as: never crashed car died, wear seatbelt? Yeah slept 12 hours day second dose. Definitely smart idea take day off. think good reason impressed. Biden Administration came January 20 realized January 30 vaccination plan. means February March created, organized, executed plan place. UK people organizing vaccine distributions back 2020. US didn't. think kind federal cooperation still possible. Mines excited vaccine, can't wait. First time he's ever actually wanted vaccine haha. Awesome! got first Pfizer shot Monday. little nervous too, haven’t issues all!  think obvious, actually contrary predominate theory point. 

Transmission air specific meaning infectious diseases, virus transmitted via small droplets remain suspended air long periods time. widely believed possible Covid, vast majority transmission occurs way larger droplets quickly fall onto surface transmission occurs there's someone immediately present inhale droplets fall. 

This piece published Lancet argues primary form transmission fact smaller droplets could remain air hours infected person left.

Here [CDC scientific brief airborne [the article important note study basically op-ed scientific journal. generally peer reviewed represent new research.  efficacy measure many people get versus don't. 

Efficacy measure effective risk *reduction* relative others. 

Imagine hypothetical world vaccinated population .008% infections like read hear... unvaccinated population .005% infections. would imply vaccine *negative* efficacy (obviously impossible) even though *absolute risk* infection low. 

This fundamental issue people understand comes vaccine efficacy. Israel, example, unvaccinated person today (assuming disease spread homogenous, sub-population anti-vax) lower risk catching disease vaccinated person would peak spread. Cases 98%, exposure risk 98%, actually *more* efficacy vaccines themselves. 

This herd immunity important. disease spreading widely endemic population, risk remains vaccinated individuals well. Measles classic example this: despite 95% effective, vaccinated person likely get measles low-vaccination city/peer group unvaccinated person place high measles vaccination rates. 99.999% means 99.999%, 100%. wasn’t trying - said SA (with fewer resources smaller capacity) punching it’s weight give world wealth information B1.351 well variant interest may appear across African continents.
To give credit, take away UK’s world-renowned genome sequencing network. SA team simply happen know shared everything know B1.351 behaviour. undoubtedly people trust particular topic. think big part people don’t want vaccinate folks don’t want mask up. drop mask mandates vaccinated folks, unvaccinated folks (who already disagree mask policies) going flat lie avoid wearing masks anymore. completely misread tone intent post. I'm done internet. Fuck humanity. MIL fence. smoker overweight gets she'll pretty high risk. husband decided we'll offer advice help answer questions research questions give good advice. We've married year (siblings/parents wedding last April) want meet future grandchildren.

I think need patient caring towards unsure. someone's anti-vax asshole, deserve cold shoulder. Beyond abundance caution think would geared towards making sure everyone still follows restrictions nobody vaccinated since there’s easy way glance tell someone vaccinated dangerous public. I’m open ideas like vaccine passport. Give vaccinated people chance hang things together. 1/5 US population totally vaccinated point, soon number 1/3. secured environment, could essentially return normal-ish life.

Not mention things like entering countries.

We need give general population, particularly young people way carrots get vaccinated. Thanks insight. informative. agree, point making everything clickbait. term seems turning ""I like agree clickbait article"". People care right whether die. preventing going road trip? adults family vaccinated go? children get vaccine? Exactly. 

Or lets put way: 

1) get AZ jab, 100% got AZ/J&amp;J jab. 

2) COVID 8 10 times risk blot clots AZ/J&amp;J Jabs.

3) Therefore, chance getting blood clots actually less COVID less 8%-10% getting COVID wait different vaccine. 

Where live, wait different vaccine would weeks. Meanwhile, continue things avoid COVID last year like working home. area experience big wave infections.  words, would definitely risk clots AZ/J&amp;J jab COVID. 

That said, none takes account COVID sorts bad things besides clots, even know people compare chances clotting first place. Yea.....you already said that. I'm talking said hundreds fully vaccinated people died. Try little genuine argue good faith. Exactly. even specific, also factor risk specific clotting events alternate ""plan B"" vaccine-- risk may less common mRNA vs Adenoviral, incidence 0. 

 must consider CVT adverse event associated greater incidence amongst covid infected person's. 

Age gender aside, risk benefit analyses different someone stays home get Moderna next week vs someone works bar, lives 5 others might wait 3 months alternate AZ/J&amp;J That’s basically it’s like Vietnam. difference one country zero covid cases day, thousands... Even 6 weeks one thing, buy CoronaVac Getting second Moderna shot today. nervous! Hey leave Andrew this.


But also confirmation could still infected, asymptomatically, thus infect unvaccinated person.

I still believe confirmation... new data, like article, imply fully vaccinated people fact, protected serious illness, protected infection. Masks mandated reach herd immunity. That's always goal. Unfortunately, herd immunity means 70% population vaccinated, anywhere close yet overall, many areas shamefully lower that. (My state sitting 18% fully vaccinated right now.)

There people may able get vaccinated one reason another, even want get vaccinated, might trouble finding appointment. know people waited weeks theirs. Mask mandates help protect vulnerable people enough people population vaccinated rely herd immunity. hug family again. Mine feels like happens good workout -like numbers clinical trial data reports countries vaccine use, including recent CDC report. compare reported infections vaccinated people reported infections similar group unvaccinated people. 

The headline appears make calculation based total number vaccines given total number infections reported, without context many unvaccinated people got covid.

Finally, please misunderstand: saying vaccines effective, worth getting. Meanwhile Brazil stock market time high.

Seriously though, people seem think weakness accept guidance protect others, that's pandemic going stretch forever seems. People keep asking big COVID learning is. Usually go-to answer ""to never cancel plans again!"" ""do want, could taken away fast!"" 

What I've learned, though, world very, big very, small. virus started one person, pretty much. look exploded. think American never truly considered goes beyond borders. Yes, US GREAT right now, despite uptick places, there's real people going stress, illness, loss, chaos faced last year time—and many people PS5 proper family get it; see proper vaccine least 6-12 months. scary. look completely differently. significantly less likely vaccination to:

1. Get infected
2. Spread virus

So factor significantly activities individual chooses engage in. heard lot, less camp well. I'm extremely pro-vax, think wanted see research, impacts, results, etc. got vaccine. want get it, obviously happened fast wanted evidence case known impacts right away.

I healthy full-time single father (35M) young kid, concern health.

I'm Canada, quite behind, fortunate enough get first dose Pfizer days ago happy relieved it! hope so. go back work person August. Hoping go July. I'm Ontario too. Right worse, vaccinated (and vaccinating) LOT population us give numbers weeks see stands. Children can't get vaccinated. I'm frustrated dragging longer. know wont ever go away, thought Florida would 5k cases day now. got pretty upset Moderna news broke morning, holy crap Justin, *8 million* doses?? think finally drop whole ""the government failed us"" narrative, true. mention 300K J&amp;J doses due arrive next 10 days, things really starting turn corner vaccine supply front. simple restrictions = lower cases restrictions = higher cases.

Notes:

* Data [CDC vaccination demographic trends exact totals every age group downloaded CSV. site provides graph data time. graph title says ""Date Administered"", data closely represents doses ""Date Reported"".
* Changes calculated unrounded numbers may differ rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC source due lack age-related vaccination data, data match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assumes 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17 since vaccines currently approved use age 16.
* 16+ 0+ age groups include doses administered unknown ages. usually less 0.02% total doses administered. need dispute something provided evidence of. That's discussion I’m trying explain concerns people like have

Ok Joe Rogan.

Step 1: Say believe experts, course, ""just questions"".
Step 2: Say important listen ""both sides"" argument, bringing opinions completely unproven things zero evidence presenting side argument.
Step 3: Rake tons money people hear want hear believe want believe instead trusting actual we’ll come demand answers

And is. Step 4: provided answers, repeat ""I questions!"" that’s unlikely make anyone else change mind.

So find expert Twitter. Find podcast. Wait local hospital give Q&amp;A. Giving unwarranted opinions things thing ""being concerned"". truly concerned concern troll, go find answers. Read comments. correct college said is, manner standardized tests measure students ability things falsely raises children means. Yea right, bad, looked further. Nahh, never used mint condition. Tell percentage protection lower, get percent off. still think airborne transmission diseases/hygiene theater UK ethno-religious-political tribe (white evangelicals, US) rejected pandemic real. Without doubt yeah mean look US vaccinating 3+ million per day, 15k seems like drop bucket entire world enjoy games without worry host control hurt hosting.but hey know thought that, right actually. Since Pfizer/BNT continuing *increase* deliveries rather decrease, there's high chance actually wrap whole thing ahead schedule. What's already forecasted allow everyone two doses mid-end summer. absolutely cannot declare pleateu yet.

Not mention pleateu 7500+ cases day fucking horrible well.

The last pleateu lasted almost entire month well Actually vaccines Frau Merkel.  
Now need That’s accelerate means. really want make analogies physical motion, starting jerking (changes acceleration) companies already developing vaccines even agreed fund research ones received research funds weren’t first market. You’re giving credit things little begrudging island helps government willing use bonus advantage. Yeah I’d imagine even 1 full year still wouldn’t enough. need back bold claim sources. College lot taking tests, writing papers, math/science problems reading literature/papers (depending major). I'd say standardized tests cover basics pretty well. That's one way expressing citizens want vaccine. Keep mind stores private property owners require wear mask, must shop elsewhere.

I hope we're July stores feel confident removing mask policies. can't that. Logistically they're enough notice. know flu vaccine new every year right? give 2 year old? Evolution states strong survive. token let old die preexisting conditions since weak anyway. can’t find apolitical source that’s acceptable sub guidelines google “Fauci 10,000 cases per day” find articles it. Good thing isn’t pandemic happening people dying. Plenty time bureaucracy slowly consider ways possible blame shifted someone else. /s all.

I've known surface-based germophobia strictly rooted science, anxiety hard shake additional solid information use argue always appreciated. trials mostly dosing efficacy.  assaulting newborn immune systems decades

""assaulting"" negative connotation it... i'd suggest immunization schedule anything based ""limited emergency use approval"".

regardless whether actually safe not, label certainly makes SEEM unsafe compared anything else schedule. think centralized healthcare density helps UK this. Vaccination hesitation aside, US 17.5% rural population 65+ plus. live acreage mile-long driveway, door door vaccination difficult. come town every week two supplies, would vaccinate right then. injured job replaced robot, career basically over. either go back learn something else get job nearest Walmart. college degrees, even field longer exists, degree get ladder new career path. IMO degrees lot flexible trades come cost. vaccine working. Vaccines totally prevent cases prevent symptoms. often wonder fuck I'm paying tuition for. second level chemistry, weeks get 10 minute video recording, whereas campus would get almost 5 hours lecture week. math last semester got one hour instruction online, course took actual instruction time. spend much time googling sources might well own. 

This semester almost finished, last exams next week. NINE lab reports two courses even marked yet.  think lot athletes willing believe risk outweighs won’t go..but lot one shot, prime 2024 they’re willing take chance  need start bringing carrot/stick approach. 

Carrot: Discounts things getting vaccine. 

Stick: vaccine requirement go sports games/universities, etc.

In experience, aren’t *that* many people steadfastly opposed it. mostly don’t see point benefit it. 

Many get hear get discount MLB/NFL/NCAA game get it.  Pfizer said need boosters

Pfizer said plan place *if* need boosters. Big difference. GOOD.

I wish Canadians same. precise problem. People, individual level, think control do. 

Vaccine supply delivery biggest problem right now. 1:1000000 chances silly make federal decisions on.

Perhaps course pandemic lied numerous times multiple different entities including government medical communities? mention fear mongering done media. could require returning citizens quarantine 2 weeks returning hot spot countries. understand. Pope openly pro vaccine, Catholic church take another path? source? think depends situation right? study view lectures home (can't dorm whatever reason- money, deadly pandemic) disruptive home environment, can't utilize say, library, issue self-motivation. can't afford laptop fully functional one, equipment helps. That's point. I'm saying comparing death counts right death counts first wave meaningless, since deaths still lagging behind cases, cases show sign tapering off. current situation like first wave last year all.

I would say first time something like hitting India, virtue much worse last year kind exercise equipment, half-arsed pushups/situps every day past weeks feeling better years. need gym bunny, really thing ""too little make difference"". exercise better none. least vaccines working though. You’d idea otherwise  That's exactly describe myself. mean people get it. 

I got first dose last week. Probably late plan move olympics US. Finally, new information. Apparently exercise good us ?

Also clear study, early pandemic quite bit false positive antibody tests unless marines confirmed positive covid test looking antibody tests accurate. it’s anything like Texas, average person continue wear masks don’t, never did, even government mandate. people hate lockdowns masks sure best get lock downs masks you’re doctor scientist, you’re cosplaying one internet giving bad advice grasp can't lay concluded benefits pause way costs. see formal estimate FDA many deaths think J&amp;J vaccine cause vs many deaths prevent.

Because makes people LOT money. lost minds J&amp;J thing. 

Covid killing hundreds people day. 

Assuming J&amp;J pause delays 350k shots day 15 days would 5.25 million people less protected 15 days. 

At 70k confirmed infections day likely 200k actual infections, assuming 99% unvaccinated, (198kinfections)/(230M unvaccinated people)=0.08% unvaccinated pop getting infected every day, 

Times 15 days, would 1.3% getting infected. 

1.3% times 5.25 million would 68k infections. 

68k infections IFR 0.1%(assuming people skew younger now) would 68 deaths. infected people give virus people thus real number deaths significantly this. 
 
Does credible doctor really believe J&amp;J vaccine cause 68 deaths 5.25 million shots previous 7 million maybe caused 1? Reading headlines hysterical things know help.

The main differences are: 

* happens shortly take it, likely presence medical professionals (unlike AZ, week two later)
* said professionals actually something save life (AZ higher rate lethality side effects)
* survive, long term effects (with AZ, affected, chances deal rest life)

At least that's reasoning Danish authorities stop AZ Pfizer, far remember press conferences.

As guy repeatedly said, countries high infection rates, AZ benefits indeed outweigh risks, that's case Denmark. need continue wear mask isolate. doesn’t anything us heard Fauci talking similar goal either previous taskforce meeting House committee hearing yesterday goal making singular Coronavirus vaccine figuring vaccine would induce broad detection.

(Disclaimer: doctor medical field). We’ve already managed eradicate several diseases across world, wouldn’t unprecedented. Given completely unprecedented (in lifetime) effect disease world, wouldn’t surprised another disease manage eradicate, albeit number years even decades. definitely near-future timescale. Pfizer bottle-filler implementation-partner vaccine researched Germany: Biontech. would google county health department state health department email website. let know reach company directly.  call live vector vaccine. viral vector. contain live virus, means cannot get covid it. 

As pregnant woman, big deal distinguish two. Live vaccines recommended pregnant women fear infect baby. registered vaccination centre? 79 received invitation time idea we're letting people America infection fears Americans apparently let us without worry kind hilarious. 

The tables turned, boys. pregnant person, thank you! still can’t get vaccine yet (because I’m Europe), thanks people like you, option might open day soon. Haven’t 100 million people already covid...so aren’t close herd immunity? probably done. That’s true, last year bit really proved easily different people manipulate sets data align agendas... CAPITALISM BREEDS INOVATION said last year...of course airborne... quibbling droplets versus air degree much. downvoted oblivion. There’s evidence documented place. Goddamn we’re slow determine shit. Basic basic research transmission wrong knowledge droplets hopelessly old. Back drawing board. Edit: we’re Herd immunity may long time away. 100m Americans vaccine hesitation according latest polls. Won’t passports matter several months? I’d expect enough people get fully vaccinated herd immunity then. Yup pfizer would nothing without Biontech hey hard feelings Lmao, y’all sure don’t want rejoin British empire? current government ass. [Wait, I've seen one. Canada too.

Here's case investigation unit layout revealed small work spaces making social distancing difficult one shared breakroom common practice HCWs remove masks eat lunch sitting close proximity one another. Depends level fecal matter. IIRC Mythbusters found bacteria ATM machine toilet seat. much data see regarding covid intentionally misinformation. unfortunate That's probably healthy trend, mean economically healthy. Nothing covid. plotline Hangover. 

I KNOW HAPPENS IM RANDOMLY MARRYING SOMEONE ENDING TRUNK.  go grocery store? cause one signs saying 'free vaccines' every 20 ft. wouldn’t better host spectators outright cancel like many seem suggesting? laugh diarrheal diseases still huge cause death developing world. 330,000 children year die Africa alone it. 

Before modern sanitation public health measures, diarrheal diseases major cause death too. Ok ever get sort definite answer whether vaccinated people spread non-vaccinated people? feel like getting bunch mixed messages suddenly stopped talking EU exported many doses largely exchange materials needed produce vaccines. Ok stay even longer leave rest us alone trial ever done. Even second trial, US, 90% mark even sight. I’m never going low vaccination states pandemic ignoring states like Florida again. learned lot values different people regions pandemic can’t forget didn’t take extraordinary situation seriously. US watching movies stretches analogy, actively trying vaccinate many people possible. Sometimes symptoms linger previous infection Whenever Germany used strong-arm tactics past, always turned well, right? Trump could put face half them. Abortions some, miniature American flags others. think people believe covid get eradicated. goal herd immunity like vaccines.  think likely vast bulk competing athletes get vaccinated attending. governments, prestige thing - spare small amount vaccines people basically represent country.

The spectators, however, fckd. imagine locals vaccinated. Even masks, transmission high indoor sports like badminton/boxing. Tbh could true, surely it’s easy enough find graphs show EU numbers then? mean Turkey alone experiencing crazy numbers, currently 7 day average 50k. I’m defending EU, I’m UK, opinion it’s lazy slightly misinformative use data. tiny fraction shipped. rotting away warehouse. masks shown particularly effective though?

Over distancing avoiding contact general? Man, college important time develop socially emotionally. can't imagine I'd like spend much home front computer.  know bunch people got contacted NJVSS February one since. idea logic is, happy still reaching people. Muh leader... actually reports mrna vaccines causing blood clots, couldn’t find detailed info credible sources. given they’re really actively investigating it, wonder data get regarding mrna vaccines actually reflects reality. 4 weeks interval Chile iirc keep saying things like that, healthcare officials area started getting shots area last week. still word vaccinating elderly area. husband's 98 year old grandmother told may another month two get hers, think healthy adults getting fall winter earliest. Yes, depends define ""low"". threshold definitely higher countries. can’t get paid baby sitter would trust. truth really simple though? 


Again, simple let's look Colorado. 6 million people live state 3 million people received least one dose. large portion unvaccinated people children people living far away dense urban areas (Denver, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs) course holding out. number cases surging? simple answer that, unless ton break-through cases, vaccine working efficiently told, new case data incorrect skewed. 


I want clear, I'm pro-vaccine think conspiracy theories fucking stupid; there's something add cases flaring like crazy vaccines distributed like crazy too. People lax they're going hanging friends day receiving vaccine. course, people — they've also likely going whatever want whole time anyway. lot people willing get vaccine taking it, going home, holding safe. Vaccine end goal population whole. individual level. *a lot* vaccinated, wearing masks public, etc. still done population safe general. daughter incoming freshman upcoming fall. born 2 weeks late class 2020. graduated high school year ago there's way hell would sent matter accepted to. probably better off. College huge rip scam respect that. read 21 days People pull purpose, nothing shape mask knowing use except got 2nd Pfizer shot yesterday (early 20s). bad fever last night, feel slightly fever feels like hangover. Hoping ends soon. honestly would have. Paying price sit dorm take remote classes bullshit. Plus extended acceptances year wait get real college experience. 


On flip-side increase adults either going back school due increase online classes. works well lifestyle. I'm assuming somewhere 10% 15% Colorado residents tested positive previously.

It possible contract disease multiple times.

In December, CO averages 3,900 new cases per day. Now, CO averaging 1,500 cases per day. Mathematically, makes sense....if half population ""immune"" would make sense see infection numbers drop accordingly.

I see Colorado record increase...I see colorado recent increase, statistically possible due bystander effect.

People see people get vaccine, assume need get vaccine ""someone else already got theirs.""

I think foolish believe anything get ""better"" 7 billion people fully immunized. large public outcry governor take action? not, route public wants take, elevated risks costs, even point stepping in?

I'm familiar polls, think huge outcry step in. I'd assume 51% population believes save money lives cities municipalities taking action 

Ann Arbor mask restrictions last heard. Probably cities elsewhere. people said taking seriously eating indoor restaurants otherwise regular unmasked indoor contact people may vaccinated. view reckless behavior. sure seniors specifically, us twice much vaccine miss understand comment. I’m 100% pro vaxx gotten covid jab. I’m making fun people try come side effects saying it’s “you know” nothing else. That’s arguments always sound. little reasoning imo combination factors. Phizer vaccine currently legal vaccine, others approved yet (and approval may delayed). Also, getting shipments Phizer vaccine difficult (it's produced country), organizing vaccinating people also incredibly slow bureaucracy.

In movie Shin Godzilla, government can't react act timely manner emergency? joke, truth. That's covid many issues here. supposed live fear rest lives?

Also. Isn’t racist? Indian? point completely unrelated mRNA tech nothing past vaccination efforts.

And yes, people make whatever choice wish stay hell away others keep masked up. want that, need responsible take one vaccines.

Foreign powers actively spreading disinformation weaken country. aid them. Yes, got right, schools reopen everywhere, spite many covid cases zone. Restaurants opened cases low.

Please tell I'm wrong, know everything country roughly 163 million people, tiny numbers compared neighbours. not. questioned pressed conference whether injecting bleach kill corona virus would work. Obviously dumb question equally dumb thing say president US. instruct people anything.   fairrrrrrrr stupid people made life suck year. could’ve different. difference covid right widespread is. February 271 kids US died record high number kids dying flu year problem right covid absolutely everywhere. Kids much higher chance catching flu. vaccines available everyone, including children, think covid control (although likely gone). point think it’s reasonable say don’t need precautions. aren’t yet.

Also, never said “shut down.” said wear masks. Huge difference. Lucky lol forgot thermometer doesn’t even work... feels like bad hangover fever. 24 hours 2nd dose hope ends soon Less side effects Pfizer equally effective. So, happened look day, Japan Olympic committee already said definitely delay another year.

There multiple issues. biggest one already cost $2.8 billion delay one year. Another issue can’t hold onto village another year (they’re turned apartments), it’s simple you’d think use hotels. issues too.

I advocated delaying another year, looked it, realized unfeasible was. :( tough one, one hand data needed fairly low risk... hand covid fairly low risk children too. know is, know should, still happens screen name post says everything need you. Love argument. ""If saves one life, worth it.."" crowd good response it. like brain short circuits lol.  people called fact possible save lives things (such masks/social distancing half year

No, people talked lockdowns, simply masks/social distancing. actually oppose keeping masks flu season, example.

And half year anyways, flu season usually lasts longer 2-3 months least Europe light measures masks certain indoor spaces could last even less. anyone know what's interval first second dose? seems like awesome job, clear anyone reading this, six figure salaries *not* norm trades. Salary data available online shows average 75 percentile salary. 

But isn’t saying you’re wrong. sounds like great job! Hell yeah. said let's postponed college business cause covid like decade ago. Obviously worked. pastor says catch Ebola simply someone sneeze blood mouth 80% mortality prevention bloomberg article? even feel shot I'm sure looked quite stoic getting it, would hate get shot front press taking photos videos. Germany (actually think Germany bit higher). think kill election campaign anything. Signed kids too.
But families area clinical trial yet open here! Sadly, repeatedly warned masks weren’t important cleaning surfaces touching face eyes would minimize Covid cases. I’m year later still message really clearly communicated public. Mostly catching Covid you’re letting people cars homes. 56% asymptomatic.  simple truth enough people vaccinated yet. vaccine's effectiveness already proven. headline misleading. They're also gonna reopen restaurants activities pretty much everywhere, til 10PM full capacity. That's actually far better 50.6% figure I've heard before. signing young children make person insane, makes cautious. bad guys this, extremely difficult thing people shamed they're hesitant allow government experiment children. Damn straight, got first jab yesterday! probably world agreed count light symptom cases, even vaccine. know why? Honestly asking, verified long-term side effects actually getting disease, none types vaccines. realize people may worry rushed emergency/experimental, pretty clear able accelerated based vaccines similar viruses around shown side effects. guess see brilliant move vigilance stupid false alarm next months fear illness death convinced already. nothing will. Welcome r/evolution got second dose got stocked Gatorade Tylenol. ready worst. 24 hours later.. nothing sore arm. anticlimactic 🤷🏻‍♂️ glhf curfews clearly government punishing citizens. can't believe people see that. they're going cause people gather one another's homes. likely cause corona spikes anything. Yeah, would believe Russia's numbers want include them. believe Russia's numbers? bloody wave, except one state, Michigan. U.S. case curve sort inching up, barely, might even anymore. trash headline. think find countries anything close fully vaccinated years. going get herd immunity global scale stricter travel restrictions - they'll continue loosen people vaccinated.

But I'm glad saying keep restrictions forever ever people vaccinated case - that's one I've seen floating around lately pretty horrifying.  things, sometimes makes sense sometimes doesn't.

I go hiking lot, wear mask entire time. Mostly model daughter masks big deal important follow rules. Early pandemic, alone front. least, people kept around neck pocket threw passed someone trail. Now, nobody bothers. think high 60's ceiling. 

Really? We're already 60% (of adults) vaccinated England, healthy 45 generally available yet. 50s (who eligible), take-up rate 95%. haven’t thought covid 8 months browse covid subreddit. Interesting. sure getting at, particular story linked report study concluded. could reported results study prior now... (the study) published yesterday (Thursday, April 15th).

Yes bit confusing seem silly study seemingly confirms lot us consider common sense... sometimes common sense actually wrong, important studies anyway confirm refute ""common sense"". important mainstream publications report results let us read journals know. :) ...kid's trials mostly dosing efficacy.

Emphasis added. They’re going reminded everyday years. Except world leaders already discussing population getting vaccinated won’t lift restrictions fully. Yup. Iowa February people said ""just wait 4 8 weeks!!!""

Iowa get case explosion.

My wives bed week 2nd coming 4 33,000,000 number? want less people get covid vaccine, sure. losing shit India? someone please explain?

Flu season literally lasts half year that's without curve-flattening effect masks/social distancing have. literally saying people wear masks public half year.

Left devices, doubt permabears CDC would come conclusion enact ""recommendations"". posts far reasonable subreddit, wants pretend COVID exist vaccines magic bullets instead effective, still one part solution make thing history. ... would remove mask mandate everyone wants vaccinated?

That's like stopping race 90% done.   time, guess.

But honestly, things really getting enforced. restaurants, bars clubs one wears them, cinemas ""eating popcorn"" need wear them, need wear small social gatherings etc. guess mass workplaces supposed enforce them, seen happening either. real shutdown, early on. Serious travel restrictions quarantine requirements believe. hammer ... smash smash ... scientific terminology 

The fact felt need clarify made laugh. Thanks.  already lost grandma last year COVID too. really sucks, still sound real. Right. shit gross virus allowed spread freely among large population unvaccinated people, mutate, vaccine longer effective.

We need mass adoption vaccine end we're stuck COVID merry-go-round. People barred participating society elect get shot. I’m BC Bonnie’s voice soothing doesn’t make poorly they’ve done last 6 months.  will; I’m saying need anyone’s permission. irritated people never satisfied.  Sorry hear grandma hope fully recovers :( lost grandpa COVID, sucks wouldc autoimmune response occur adenovirus vaccines mRNA vaccines?  57 days. Mine 8 weeks dot surgical setting doctors required change masks every two hours. wearing longer without washing replacing putting health risk (Bacteria, contamination, etc.) last time exposed Polio?  absolutely force get shot. disease allowed spread unchecked among portion population, continue mutate, may eventually evade vaccine. 

It's matter accepting risk, matter actually ending thing effectively.. That's mRNA nice comes flu vaccine. Instead predict future, actually work strains exist extent mRNA vaccine done 6 months. title picture like isn't. record high numbers cases, smell/taste first thing go, I'm curious knew happened? like burning smell nose sort smell overpowers everything else? just... smell, normal nothing smelled like anything anymore?

Curious know guys experienced. We've got similar number people vaccinated first doses UK. We've week opened gyms outdoor leisure. interesting see cases look 4 weeks. think I'd rather extra shitty flu one day, normal flu twice though.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Ughhhhhh mean yay ughh avoid. one actually alternatives. Localities businesses still allowed precious mandates. see people panicked. Ever Israel? city matter? 
People often crammed shoulder shoulder narrow streets sidewalks. 

The research shows socially distant outdoors minimal risk, crowded outdoor spaces. Risk death round trip run would 1 2,500,000

Risk death hour spend grocery store would 4 33,000,000 US, currently. Shit Yeah could see leading slower adoption. scheduled mine asked insurance info first though “I thought free?” isn’t obvious schedule without insurance info it’s free. disagree. That's good read biological science.

Well thanks, appreciate that. Unfortunately biologist expert sociology geopolitics advice guidance confidently propagate biological perspective. AZ promised delivered. 
The EU simply ordered stuff started getting pissed delivered. 
None problems present biontech/pfizer exporting also exceeding delivery quotas EU therefore got second order. failure adjust distribution now. area continues vaccines spare areas can't jab fast enough stop sending many vaccines rural Trump country start sending cities people actually want them. Getting reinfected still really, really rare even variants, would get milder symptoms chance get reinfected, would extremely unlucky get reinfected serious case Well first global pandemic life time changed lot things. learning virus time passed caused ""rules"" change.

I think whole topic lot communities. community let certain stores get packed example. stores limited. Casinos open also limited, got denied entry wait certain amount people left.

This pre-vaccine, solution problem leadership country horrible. vaccine cases dropping, things slowly opening back normal getting manageable important part. county reporting 1/000 deaths day, one wanted go anywhere. dropped almost 0, people willing go out. Utah has, far, 67 deaths per 100k people Israel 69 deaths per 100k people. Utah virtually restrictions masks since May 2020. people jump conclusions population density I'll throw numerous studies disproving relationship population density infection. many people sub like “get rid restrictions back normal now” even cases still rising there’s still lot death. I’m forever lockdown crowd, think least get point cases drop masks. Curious, include West Bank Gaza numbers? not, interesting see much regions poor vaccination rates impact regions excellent vaccination rates, preview likely divide US elsewhere. Vaccine Passport: urgent clinic first Moderna shot confirmed central database vaccinations, except clinic's local database. guess way vaccine passport exist future, got paper vaccination card proof authenticity. first shot Pfizer worse. bad muscle pain arm leg side injection limited range motion lasted almost week. 2nd shot muscle pain. Slept 12 hours felt like mild flu I'll take muscle pain cramps first shot. Also lucky get fever chills. Anyone BC here? 

Your health officials pleasant voices. Literally unintentional ASMR. I'm jealous. Nope, first dose. Second dose way 4 months fall still infect others? you’re vaccinated, chance transmission others much lower. bother, point subreddit got infiltrated large group antimaskers. dumbest argument that's caused much unnecessary hassle whole pandemic.

Imagine people stopped crying wore damn mask. would far fewer cases, millions retail workers high-risk individuals would infinitely less stress whole thing. really disgusting think much easier entire pandemic could gone people politicize virus. Thanks, wife already booked tomorrow went. doses? That's comforting hear. hope stays way. seems easy someone say ""the scientists lied us again."" thought yearly booster (especially variants) already expected? Like surprise? Moderna working booster months. meant anyone covid died marked covids death. Even hundred years old smoker overweight heart disease. 
I think saw one covid death died blood alcohol level like 400. 
Covid isn’t killing 500k. covid factors are..but distinction Bravo. Hardly ever put foot wrong lady. Yes far 6 months, it'll time find long immunity really lasts. 
Obviously longer better. seems likely, although downside side effects flu shot coronavirus shot time. vaccinated not, nobody else there, fine.

If vaccinated not, nobody else there, fine.

If anyone else vaccinated, one people live vaccinated, fine according CDC, lots people would tell fine. disagree. That's good read biological science.

Sociologically geopolitically, think it'll hold up. patience US generally next round emergency measures comes around expires, they're dropping restrictions adding back unless literally rivers red streets.

I know people told protect vulnerable one time, they'd ask list names people throw busses. It’s crazy concerned. I’m much concerned virus shots. J&amp;J aside, millions Moderna Pfizer shots administered around world, whole year ago. clots, one died, gotten shots, thousands people would gotten virus died.

Please get shot, might save life. mean yeah also think restrictions lifted adult wants vaccine easily get one Question:
- covid variant, antibodies protect original covid variants x number months? way around? Truth hurts.  vaccine heard worst/best? direct comparison. 100% chance getting AZ vaccine what's % chance catching covid? reports immunity lasts ""only"" 6 months. saying 6 months long studied. boosters planning annual. even clear yet need boosters.

There vaccines continue provide immunity 30 40 years later. would assume vaccines going shortest lived vaccines history. I’m somehow surprised... NH 45th cases 44th deaths. must low population density.

Many seem forget Biden's ""100 days masks"" ends two weeks. Though brought two months. agree completely. Though say restrictions effectively Israel least family there. Unmasked passover gatherings, parties, concerts, name it. fever 101.7 around clock chills 24 hours. I’m fine. Tell pop 500mg Tylenol every 4-5 hours. Zero reason guys need go urgent care. also great point. feel sorry you. bailed halfway following day called next. Sleep Advil. Hope feel better. end day, AZ J&amp;J vaccines go places could good (because logistical challenges related mRNA first gens) rather countries paid ahead line, I'd say stumbled efficient solution. woke 3 night got (Pfizer) shivering sweat shirt. Took ibuprofen went back sleep woke 7 fine felt fine 1 PM got fever, chills, body aches lasted 3 hours, ibuprofen managed take care Utter rubbish. Ah yes, right, 60+ belongs group three ones already admitted also states yet Fucking seriously people saying shit said natural immunity virus. Long term immunity based whether memory cells recognize virus, produce new antibodies, fight virus even know infected. bread circuses? You’re letting fear completely take here. hasn’t even proven J&amp;J causes blood clots. point J&amp;J would accelerate herd immunity net basis would save lives. Especially treatment CVST understood agree lockdowns. right started leadership leadership state. mean, point want. Virtually everyone know vaccinated immediately going back lives. Travel, family, friends, hugs, dinner, airplanes, bars, clubs, restaurants, name it. meeting today everyone said first thing going fully vaccinated.

The Faucis world probably tell hide bed another year want. hope contain outbreaks Japan. think that's bet pedantic, I'm honest.  


99.992% vaccinated people get COVID certain period time. avoided getting it, failed become infected. Colloquially, ""dodged"" it.  actually declared ""herd immunity"" 56% vaccination 30% population 18 around 85% elegible adults taken vaccine 

Plus Israel vaccinated can't get green pass means can't visit indoor hospitality venues. includes Kids vaccine well adults.   populous state nation. Sadly, think you’re right. made two culture references don’t think got either one. Oh well. Move along guess. might work all, know I'll bring gym, plane, restaurant go back those. I'm still wiping phone stuff grocery store ffs, even though know there's low chance fomite transmission. ask - *why* antibody titer consideration immunity? reasonable assume cells make antibodies needed, exposed antigen? I'm necessarily saying wrong... given confidence, want know know talking about. tell cell produces antibodies upon reinfection long initial infection? kind immunity called? would disproportionately given vaccines large cities rural areas would complain despite fact aren’t signing agree aim risks many countries, including UK I'm from, there's restrictions age risk/benefit make much sense younger people. also think probably unrealistic expect 0 deaths vaccine pandemic need pragmatic. People understandably concerned think sometimes overlooking risks medical interventions take/ without second thought we're critical situation millions people dying. get coming though.  Let’s go Guyana 🇬🇾 Lots data link below. There’s mention threshold low disease activity 25 cases per 200,000 people two-week period. seems target, it’s stated front. 

You may like Inslee, Washington done better job Covid pretty much state. 
47th cases per capita 45th deaths per capita. since case numbers gone last month, probably “Yes, vaccinated regardless whether already COVID-19. That’s experts yet know long protected getting sick recovering COVID-19. Even already recovered COVID-19, possible—although rare—that could infected virus causes COVID-19 again.” Literally try reading while. Source masks ""our best protection transmitting covid short vaccinations""? I'm anti-masker, believe overstating efficacy here. sad elementary kids can't go face face vaccinated teachers point. Working class families deserve ""zoom room"" kids. ""We've tried nothing we're ideas!"" quiet. lose. ask pharmacy?  That’s got ours. way confirmed. work workplace 150 people, half customer facing (car dealership automall). Virtually none us ever tested. One person 150 tested came positive, spouse clearly positive. even think tested anyone else dealership one (including him) symptoms. number actually positive probably huge. look excess deaths every state obviously lying numbers according you... many didn’t die? India produces huge amount vaccines. I’m sure happy keep doses use citizens residents. scientists know interpret numbers far terms cells aspects immunity. right they're going know neutralizing antibodies initially presented ""we rely one get it'll moonshot find effective one.""

We hit moonshot. I'll take many doses need happy things basically miracle. I'm part 00.008% vaccinated dodged covid. I'm Neo antibody count *only* metric this? idea adaptive immunity make antibodies cells ""learn"" them?

The human body meant walk around constant state elevated immune activity. fact may lead increase autoimmune diseases. really COVID antibodies system every day rest lives?  mean like numbers story said 600k deaths 13-month period? I’m sure more, “official” numbers Facebook, I’ll sticks CDC says. mad. deeper that. sad thing people need incentive protecting others. Hopefully evolve something better destroy ourselves. people rural areas lives changed little virus that's Well, want find one within fifty miles go right ahead guest. Definitely meant lot number dates files. picture phone worthless ""vaccine passport"" anything like that. wear one time im ouside house. place without interrumption since last summer. wouldnt mind stores. finished decade work self improvement (appearance wise) forbnow never able stay outside house without covering result progress. country restrictive mask mandate all. frustrating time dedication improving myself. send South America 3rd world country conditions still dire. Fucks women? course dude, fuck men? mean ain't judging :) Thank mean trivialize experience someone like had. forced risk lives people love earn paycheck support people awful, that's probably worst path anyone ordeal. Personally living elderly parents started leave stand feeling putting lives risk every time left house, extremely careful pretty much exposure, real chance catching it.

But really talking about, ton people care, never cared, one live cares. certain amount people vaccinated say wear masks continue spread around. username accurate. 600k additional deaths last 13 months country 328 million statistical rounding error. It’s minuscule. folks hurting themselves, mind much. Still sad, one lead horse water. 

But can't reach herd immunity levels, antivaxxers continue danger immunocompromised, children (dependents young vaccinated), serve breeding ground variants... 

Hopefully numbers small enough. infuriating... think vaccine provide level protection variants erode protection time. Similar natural flu antibodies life always work effectively natural infection. mutations virus similar thing Everyone damn fixated masks. Suddenly country full 16 year old boys want wear condom. son, I'd tell him. ""The condom friend. far sex, far girls, far fewer problems use condom.""

SC getting there, early drop facemasks going cost money. going go eat SC crowds face masks, going wait get NC GA? ^ guy fucks. really. half million million people died US alone.

Edit : NY times says 564,000 today. That's article even implying though, misleading. Get box blue surgical masks (50 $2.50 Amazon). That's crazy let wear cloth provide medical grade - even give waiting room. I'm expected take three days work? Y'all trippin understand, would timeline change? Either vax offers protection X number months, doesn't. ""Ur dumb""

Gee, thanks civil conversation. works one gets infected. feeling anti-vaxxers also anti-mask, social distancing, etc.

Even vaccinated people don’t zero risk getting COVID, people don’t get vaccinated higher risk obviously. Yep. going happen. people even get flu shot. psychological component well here. People want done pandemic, get painful reminder every six months. worked people came states (and affected countries) back Vietnam, people usually adjust pretty well, like within days. Day one living free, go bar, catch COVID fast forward two weeks, become unwell, fast forward another two, visit hospital due severe illness, multiple gatherings distancing, given frail grandparents, die, oh come? :( meanwhile placed ventilator, one week later, dead, family mourns loss massive funeral, 75%of crowd catch COVID, die... US 30 million cases, near 70k per day even vaccines, 500k deaths :)

Damn man good mask though! Ain't nothin' like smell stale air freedom rush nose! don’t know you’re sarcastic obese people much worse outcomes others Thank you! Losing taste smell worst. think contributes issue feeling better feeling worse. found resisting eating, since even delicious soup world like drinking warm water.

I hope battle successful well. Kick cancer's ass! There's still people waiting turn line delayed. delaying vaccine even week end killing far people reported blood clotting issue ever could. would make German hypothesis wrong - least described post - would adenovirus vector that's inducing antibody affects platelets, coronavirus spike protein. know. today roommate received bill ~$80 getting COVID test. one get billed don’t insurance file. assume next step involves rolling update vaccine new variants. Masks large gatherings stay year two vaccine kids take too. Maybe eventually get point it’s like flu shot schedule. it’s multiple species able jump one another seems unlikely get rid 100% time soon. know got this, vaccine reactions people already COVID vary wildly. seen data suggests kind pattern, except already strong immune response infection, probably need two vax doses. Look 2020 numbers compared years. Slight increase any.

And article reporting past 13 months saw 600k increase compared trailing 13 months. country 328 million people it’s 600k.

You guys always talk statistics talking vaccine risks let’s talk statistics here. It’s minuscule Unfortunately people rural areas don’t believe vaccines proven safe. also ones don’t wear masks. know story horse water. That’s what’s happening here. California Californians scared regulated bitches that's why. vaccinated people ditch mask dude vaccinations increasing past week Body count going mRNA Vax lifesaver medicines gotten sophisticated advanced world reopen major Power like Country USA get vaccinated cause trickle effect live? Wait, ever heading right way? Ur dumb. Go back read comment responded to. #🇪🇺💉 meanwhile spain masks outside times since basically last summer yet behind countries masks. ao fucking unfair Damn. Thank leaning in. appreciate it. British Columbia locks 2-6 deaths day might partake mostly peaceful protests. Reddit Yeah understand. vaccine teaches B cells make antibodies spike-protein viruses, actual antibody count really point right? would need stay constant elevated immune state boosters? would believe would neglect give information I'm new, people department told told anything either. yet, still find arguing people think vaccine doesn’t stop infections/spread. Less $15 burns little. What’s lose? One word.. 'Murica. Catching Covid antibodies blood (like me) really efficient too.   heard around 80% mrna vaccines Quebec likely going allow people 45+ take AZ vaccine NACI expected give updated recommendation soon. Nonna's dead, cook meatballs ragu slice Gabagool? best thing ate couple weeks ago hot, crispy French fries straight fryer, mushy, soggy potato substance end driving take home. you’ve Covid antibodies. It’s thing. Antibodies antibodies. Whether get vaxx Covid you’ve got antibodies. really. Might able find one close want it, they’re available.  say found evidence less severe covid. reading want recent source theory given up?

You one making claim evidence exists. Asking provide evidence evidence exists logical fallacy.

What found interesting research 8 months ago suggesting research done. nobody thought worth time research. basically point. could, I’m going hold probably 70 percent people area shots. one, nobody knows who’s vaccinated yet, two: don’t want seen anti masker, three: vaccine got offers 95% protection someone unvaccinated, keep extra protection double mask.

I’ll probably still mask public transit crowded spaces. really Covid, I’ve really, really enjoyed getting colds past year. lot astraZeneca articles trying unbother people blood clots happened? don’t understand rush end mandates. Wearing mask isn’t big deal conservative leaving safety rules working place seems smarter me. That’s true according doctor. doctor teenage girl spreading misinformation Reddit?  stay home live fear. eu countries decide send vaccines countries expense citizens? matter business contracts? illegal anyone bill vaccine government paid Pretty reckless ask me. vaccine turn lot less effective? Brazil countries show effectivity 50-65% according . chances coronavirus mutating something like ""common cold"" anything less 50 years would medical miracle. really would bank that. thing might become slightly less lethal (maybe), viral evolution simply happen fast timescale. really depends. still restrictions wear masks fall enough vaccine uptake, expect start see large majority vaccinated sick fucking tired get ready rain fire fucked around whole time. completely different metric trials. 99.992% figure compared anything, includes people get COVID protected vaccine, exposed virus (and thus gotten without vaccine). Presumably vast majority latter category. still super impressive. vaccines work beautifully badly calculated number. ""Dodging"" covid implies exposed develop it. even accurately, infection rate 99.992% lower equivalent unvaccinated group timeframe. Clearly neither things true. thankful live there. Absolutely! Hopefully (a little) party month two! healthcare system relies profit.its burned peoples minds lol  sounds like good area educate public can’t tell potential asymptomatic spread didn’t test people regular intervals (weekly daily) like current ongoing studies described first source, doesn’t mean reporting severe cases never tested anyone.

Studies primary secondary endpoints, primary prevent severe cases doesn’t indicate didn’t look anything else. 

The doc provided trial results directly pfizer peer reviewed FDA. I’m pretty sure it’s reliable.   Chile get caught without mask outside: $4000 fine, whereas mean monthly wage $500 Yeah sure, right, understand mean. That's (the audiance) said ""%100 effective"" eliminate community spread instead herd immunity. 617? Agreed. dropped two weeks every adult wants vaccine get one. still isn’t works, isn’t 90% people aren’t susceptible 10% are. It’s anyone vaccine roughly (that’s counting preexisting circumstances reduce individual) 90% less likely get COVID would situation without vaccine. Everyone would technically still susceptible, it’s 10% becomes quite small cases it’s stacked innate defense already mentioned.   God damnit going make joke yesterday. nobody respect mental “dibs” more??

Oh well, maybe tomorrow pp grow. :( quick search did:

Vitamin made skin it’s exposed sunlight. Sun exposure far best way boost vitamin levels, particularly foods contain significant amounts. Midday, especially summer, best time get sunlight. noon, sun highest point, UVB rays intense.

So wearing mask outside going reduce direct sunlight getting? Especially skin already covered clothing. Again, could wrong. I'm expert it. face selection pressure become less deadly. That's talking about. 

Instead started talking things like long-term effects, vaccinating many people possible, got vaccine today (congrats! get second tomorrow wife gets first next week). media said work back March 2020 hear ya, fact matter put vaccines healthy people. need limit chances issues low possible. I’m happy vaccine might getting these, would wear giant bracelet hand necklace indicating vaccine first weeks. It’s end world think ways reduce complications, including using vaccines since really sure. Spread county high last month. important thing modern science advantage provide things like vaccines help, take advantage it. vaccines available reason lockdowns ending. us kids can’t get vaccinated yet. want get back normal. time implement restrictions anti-vaxxers. terms vaccination,don't worry.they can't charge type bill getting covid shot anywhere, including pharmacies.its illegal federal law since paid already.when get vaccine,your insurance pay bill entirely any,then government pays off. I’m sure lot apathetic young adults covid vacc well. 
Only difference anti-vaccine “reason” it’s continues. 
Be glad didn’t live How'd happen? charges? sites aren’t checking kind ID. It’s out, one wiser. full protection two weeks second dose, must find gourmet doorknob lick. suggestions? Biden every politician getting various vaccines U.S show confidence vaccine along obvious health benefits.  prefer J&amp;J moderna one shot, get moderna anyways. One dose moderna gives better protection one dose J&amp;J. really want get second shot (you should, get better longer lasting protection), could tell want it.  Lol fundamental misunderstanding? booster shot. problem. God awful Ontario right now. Got first Pfizer shot today! 

Bonus: Safeway gave $20 (10% $200 purchase) getting vaccine there. subject? agreed point. never arguing likely ""kill off"" Covid begin even. know diligent FDA reviewing drug safety

The FDA clearly stated vaccines gone review, vaccines FDA approved. That’s guy’s video states, quoting FDA, article calls “misleading.” Congrats Israel! say 0 protection, said susceptible; ie capable becoming infected experiencing state disease caused said infection. Even people never immunized contact disease inherent resistance infection due body's innate immunity course inaccurate say someone immunocompetent 0 protection. I'm ok, wife compromised immune system, hit pretty hard. Thanks kind thoughts! older people vaccinated younger people wait shots (even longer lots countries ban AZ J&amp;J people 55/65 yo), young people stay inside summer like last summer. They'll see older people enjoying normal life careful themselves? Younger people bit rebellious get shots July, fear circulated among younger people start seeing friends again. bet young people continue die get blood clots vaccines. surgery without risk accept that. vaccines miniscule risk think would rather take tiny risk suffer another half year little none social life.  would mask hurt vitamin levels? created skin. shirt ""hurts"" vitamin levels way mask. ignores overall risk injured killed COVID-19. might certain people lower risk catching COVID-19, makes risk rare complication COVID-19 rare competition vaccine even. completely ignores risk they'll catch COVID-19 die injured effects virus. completely ignores risk people dying injured spreading disease. Even relatives high risk. 
They isolate “fully vaccinated”. 
Which re-infections annual covid shots never. 
I’ve long it. 
Social media/tv propaganda thing still scaring easily frightened Sorry bad luck.

I hope getting better minimal symptoms.

We've survived long, make end game! guidance I'm getting, thanks. probability risk assessment. like wearing seat belts flu shots, nobody giving 100% guarantee something protect you. could wearing seat belts still get wrecked. believe COVID eventually looked like flu several thousands people die every year kind ""live risk."" seasonal flu dangerous children COVID. know going angry I'm comparing flu covid all, really try listen here. Like seasonal flu, COVID kill children, that's always tragic. not, however, reason afraid daily basis. reason keep children home school. reason implement drastic changes society. 

Once high proportion adults vaccinated, COVID something need make drastic changes society deal with. We're seeing Israel right now. Israel actually great country test specific concerns regarding children. Israel much younger country demographically speaking US. children able vaccinated yet going present major problem, would seeing strong evidence right Israel. far vaccinated Guyana. I'm not, wear masks shot one shot contracted Covid, think need second shot unless infection asymptomatic. we've seen far polls lately.

Well Trump ain't ballot vaccine drive, we'll okay, like 2018. good. Everybody's got opinion think downvotes must read/understood mine. Lol. Ppl tend put boxes days. I'm tinfoil alex Jones type. I'm brand new parent, new mortgage, single income, die matter type. latter started covid arrived. Lol they're gonna die anyways, worth risking charges. chances could inject vaccine directly blood? One it’s literally “none vaccines FDA-approved” factual according FDA. Thank you. agree. Although choose neglect it, maybe states give vaccine countries desperately need hope companies this. great.  im obviously la county lol Lol right 
Same here. literally guess strain. It’s big monies know vaccinations work. still fully vaccinated even you’ve covid. isn’t known long antibodies infection last. vaccine needed boost immunity also protect new variants. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Covid becoming endemic. thing get choose real deal vaccine immune system gets work first. “small group”, WSJ means 0.01% 77 million fully vaccinated. I’m baffled run headline like instead one like “99.99% people fully vaccinated won’t get COVID”. literally final stretch COVID, media acting like it? they're actually process testing college students right (some vaccinated, not) collecting swabs regularly see vaccinated ppl truly carry little virus airway. think Dr. Fauci alluded ongoing study said results forthcoming time summer. need go back work, get jobs, move forward life. getting vaccine stops occurring, they're unsafe eventually, cannot stay indoors anymore need go back jobs go get car go get clothing somewhere, etc. 1) Yes, called herd immunity, claim otherwise. %100 effective reach herd immunity.

With regards statement think agree misunderstanding other.

Otherwise glad hear basically page. yes good point somewhat imprecise simplistic terminology explanations, given platform home lay audience, goal explaining concepts help people understand thresholds getting back normal life much less arbitrary seem media. Damn never end Or/and start adding restrictions vaccinated. 

People counterfeit literally everything. Counterfeit vaccination cards good reason that.  wonder crossed anyones mind yet blood clot nonsense could rumors started someone associated moderna pfizer. looking forward second one. dose 1 yesterday morning sore arm day today I’m laying couch trying everything stay awake I’m fatigued. supposed easier one. Like staying home year? that. Asking others respectful virus mutate? decide

Shouldn’t part society respects others? sayin Correct. that’s asking early getting absolutely shit moron even suggesting it. like saying half race done

More like 90% time b/c 12 months+ need month get majority vaccinations completed.

We dealt vaccines developed, tested, produced. need finish distribution takes less time development testing. paper 2006 describing link Oddly, recall UK people pretty split beginning. lot people arguing politicians said vaccines safe, take first prove it? Health Secretary challenged BBC's question time audience asked views. half said take first.

Angela Merkel course challenged time ago take AZ jab. time refused grounds rules 60s given it. she'd then, one would thought anything it. Also 3 weeks plus first dose:
-60% infections
-66% symptomatic disease 
-78% hospitalization
-80% severe covid
-84% death 

Looks like marked difference 14 21 days protection/outcomes. 
- First, never hard real number needed herd immunity, ""60-70%"". 
Second, depends vaccine efficacy. would need 60-70% immunity efficacy, vaccination. vaccine lower efficacy, need vaccinate people. lots articles news Canada Canadians going US vaccines. imposed 4 months first second doses try get many people 1 dose.

Articles people going vacation 3 weeks (and since work remote matter you) get shots. could 5 6 months here. screachers eventually silenced UK deaths count fell cliff. Children already shown get badly ill superspreaders schools open up. Staff school infect other, kids mostly don't. think we'll cruise ~60-65%, it'll tough sledding that. Hopefully time get point, 12-15 year olds eligible Yeah week ago healthy 20 something getting without good reason, lying. 

This young 20 something scheduled vaccination 4/20. Yep. last article said people know free. 

I one people. 

I confirm local game store owners brother three give expiring. brother able grab quick walmart extra one works there. one cares Absolutely ridiculous saw article somewhere suggests got lucky certain vaccine Japanese kids get little.

Supposedly, vaccine happens provide measure protection covid? 

Edit: vaccine. Terrible parent Bressan, adding many patients seeing 40s domestic workers, cleaners, retail workers waiters. “People absolutely leave home work.” People US also used free medical procedures. percentage simply assume can't afford vaccination (or worth cost). Thank you, do! Keep mind people 65 experienced serious epidemics before, heard directly previous generations seen vaccinations work. exactly people would expect highest responders. mean...we healthcare. admit, system could use complete overhaul costs absolutely insane average person. Especially without insurance. would also say sucks chronic health condition hitting premiums every year.

That said, hard get least semblance insurance Medicaid, job. Even high deductible health plan max out-of-pocket costs high, absurd. Plan wisely, make good choices, stay healthy, save money can, worry this. say position privilege, also someone done best put good position. start spot, best got. Thank replying! actually heard friend works ICU NYC it’s old guidance doctors still holding to. originally implemented try maintain vaccine supply people needed it, supply almost outpacing demand, appears dropped it. Thanks again! ""hug curtain” name hygiene theater, ultimate absurdity. hell going anymore? Yep. hit bullseye here.

It preventing infections. disrupting lives people enough feel real emergency. Bit like imposed collective mourning, happy PANDEMIC AROUND!!11!!! good. best way minimize potential variants. got really exclusive grad program waitlist around time pandemic got crazy (end March early April 2020). accept 4 students per year. Can’t help think getting waitlist got spot someone wanted put international student couldn’t come country. page, CDC references several studies draw conclusion 1 10,000, *without mention calculated based studies, studies certainly didn’t provide fixed numbers.* perspective: love see America asshole usual tried farting? flu. close flu. remotely comparable flu. Even lockdowns mask use, 10 times many americans died covid last 12 months typically die flu zero lockdowns masks.

This objectively different can't see see point continuing conversation. family vaccinated. I'm done wearing mask. Simple that. Yea would signed son know got vaccine like wife rather vaccinated literally taken 400000 cases 2 4 cases clots compared incomplete number az, haven‘t cases 184.6million doses administered. pretty obvious trying mislead public. even admitted data bad one see get thousands posts study gets shown without context analysis say again: quality journalism dead... Please keep mask. Vaccines 100% stop transmission Interesting patiently waited turn. Many age range could deemed sick frail receive shot, there’s well inactivity strongest risk factor across outcomes, compared commonly cited modifiable risk factors, including smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease cancer.

Obesity inactivity often linked characteristics active are, less likely obese. 

As much Reddit hates Health Size, people obese active. BMI perfect score. Yep. cant respond amount emotional cognitive dissonance hyperbole. Good luck man. I'm sure exactly defining ""afford"" believe can't afford it.

While states vary, people go state $30k year in.

California's going expensive, that's also California. PA sucks really true public universities, places exceptions, really rule. Plenty good schools even low $22k $23k year.

Now, something combat faster inflation rises tuition try turn back clock? Sure.

But dealing something like college obtain long term financing options relatively easy, tricky discussion exactly ""affordable"" means. think waiting couple months take kids indoor dining movie theater means failing kids. suspect time shown severe illnesses vaccine recipients something like rate unvaccinated population/prior year rates. Stop shilling fake medicine fucking asshole think seeing either effects demand peaked fact J&amp;J still paused. We're close 50% adults 1st shot. think hitting hesitancy crowd soon.

Those downright evil southern baptists germ factories rest us, kicking variants virus eventually break vaccines. write anti-vaxxers. There's hard 20% going get vaccinated regardless.  ""Hints."" realy. ""form"" anaesthetics inherent risk factors, Covid vaccine need to. create Covid vaccine _without_ even miniscule chance death healthy young individuals, probably countries moving away two vaccines using adenovirus vector, opting alternatives “COVID-19 far likely cause blood clots COVID-19 vaccine”. 

While definitely true, suspect people rationalize wanting take vaccine thinking able take appropriate measures contract COVID (and hence changes blood clots zero), opposed taking vaccine voluntarily making chances blood clots, however small may be, non-zero.  really simple though. Unfortunately good side care system due panic attacks violent outbursts 

In area, word spreads extremely quickly, point many gets chills spine hear second name, trouble finding someone first time round willing try it, got point ask family members second name “call security” don’t want risk getting caught panic attacks rare case get violent (which prob downvoted, thanks guys, helpful)

I'm necessarily saying definitely, 100% that--I'm interested people wearing masks *are* sick, mentioned. even was, justified would bad thing. Masks easy wear, hypothetical flu-season masking norm would even need strict covid ones; could probably apply crowded public places.

Oh fucks sake it’s marketing shitty ass beer making logical fallacies, like him, avoiding points crush little fantasies freedom fighter. America people also wear masks outside.

This may come shock, we're leading world covid deaths. Bollocks You’re right, also that’s social distancing - forever - rest life. 

No vacations, airline travel, nothing. 

So essence cost vs benefit situation. Either get vaccine &amp; return new normal, socially isolate permanently. Godspeed! Everyone walking around elevated antibody levels every day rest lives going lead increase autoimmune disease. Sure sensible. amuses proponents free market capitalism US cheer government endeavor yet pooh pooh similar taxpayer investment consequently price distribution controls comes healthcare. quite literally Canada insulin. I’ll get EUA vaccines one time. Even governor admits surge says state still “encouraging” everyone wear masks.

So end mask mandate now? China barbaric, tested J&amp;J vaccine population without safety checks. stop J&amp;J market ask China pay retribution.

Blood clots serious - hysteria today causing anxiety among public - cannot fault people alone reacting appropriate authorities appear negligent.

Also people cannot see damage virus - mind tends go easiest thing. Aspirate injecting make sure goin vein something, give heparin clots develop. That's start least taking account time delay. 

most people fully vaccinated short amount time, like weeks. meanwhile, people test results come early time period infected time period. 

It's also different population demographics. 

It realistic, fair comparison. Quality healthcare? Maybe, maybe, people downvoting every single story needs turned ""America Bad"" circlejerk. Go full Nintendo say delist vaccine end month. Sure, contracting covid 100% chance taking vaccine is. math works again? probability infection required make likely get brain clot Astra vaccine covid? good news Israel. Must buzzing right now. actually work way. 

Most people fully vaccinated fully vaccinated short amount time. can't compare cases many weeks ago. 

The best studies this, like UK Israeli studies, upper 80's-mid 90's efficacy (which still really great!!) I’m definitely expert, extremely serious case main thing worry lung damage AFAIU Indeed - patients getting blood thinners post treatment least month. AFAIK it’s pleasant thing take. risk death anaesthetic 1 100,000 surely would argue same, especially cosmetic procedures. many people seems second shot increased side effects, partly design - active immune response critical antigen production. wonder third shot even worse, definitely impact uptake among public. People going go that. French chef preferably Yes, absolutely must live somewhere warm. Living somewhere cold barely see people exposing skin masks past winter. remember people afraid virus stayed inside entire year. may eating right things make vitamin deficiency uber eats, always deliver stuff, said common. Well there’s ton possibilities getting issues COVID - including death. 

I think medical community governments needs look educate effects vaccine provide advise remain vigilant. already despicable.

I think 100 years' time, Chinese kids studying history America downfall, teachers asking write essays media's role it.  almost real life version trolly ethical dilemma.

Do act let trolly run 5 people able claim directly responsible deaths inaction, intervene direct trolly different track knowing actions definitely kill one person, thus taking direct responsibility person's death.

With AZ &amp; Johnson vaccine withdraw vaccine knowing less people access vaccines certain number die covid decision makers directly responsible deaths, knowingly continue distribute vaccines knowing certain number people definitely die complications related vaccine, thus decision makers would direct responsibility deaths.

I suspect ethical considerations around issues along miriad aspects covid studied centuries come. understand frowned upon hold opinion ""I'll wait FDA approved"". Like wacky, ""irrational"" conclusion arrive at? Dude same. I'm barely 24 hours post second dose feel like I'm going die. Legit thought going go ER woke body joint aches. never reactions vaccines. miserable really want go again..... Strokes common, happening often one every 40 seconds US. country is: wait enough mRNA doses available gen pop risk older people, could take months death, infected, filled beds already crowded hospitals, people slowly inefficiently traced, pcr tests done, people driven poverty restrictions, people suffering mental health issues. whole issue time sensitive, waiting greatest option see nations reopening concretely planning it. 3 months (and it'd much more, think) hell long time sixth month curfew. reason think that?  heard immune systems still thing.

The sarcasm welcome. makes difficult people ask questions related serious issues. questions entirely sincere. today, never heard every human immune low doses virus. impression given asymptomatic people immune infectious levels virus. never heard immunity virus without vaccine discussed way today. asking many clarifying questions. Zero Covid likely happen. might good somehow figure accept that. 2nd dose acquired 2 hours ago! far good!  recurrent dosing. Yeah, maybe put spin 74 deaths 77 million vaccinated patients like everyone putting spin 1-in-a-million chance blood clots AZ 77 million people United States fully vaccinated. data released CNN Wednesday, CDC said 5,800 breakthrough cases reported far, although delay reporting. Among reported cases, 396 hospitalized, **74 died**. CDC also said 29% asymptomatic. 

It's amazing UK virtually wiped virus ""shitty"" AZ vaccine (mostly one dose too), USA struggling 20-30 times numbers daily cases deaths despite apparent much ""effective"" 2-dose rollout Pfizer vaccine. Instead zero covid, think zero death vaccination. love Oxford study. Hey Oxford, sound really familiar. help make vaccine recently? don’t even know means anymore thought saying vaccines prevented severe disease though, wasn’t one important things touting? clearly showing untrue. feel like Japan done literally nothing rely geographical position stop spread blaming transmission incoming foreigners. government actually faced consequences, vaccine rollout abysmal, Olympics 99 days away, they're scrambling come reasons fact government played active hand spreading virus.

In early days decent job closing borders early lockdowns. isolated places like Tokyo, particularly targeted foreigner communities, little ramp testing. still &lt; 100k tests day nationally average. country half US population, less tests days US states WI AK. 

Further, lockdowns like friendly guidelines, government waged Go Travel campaign literally subsidize domestic travel, WFH discouraged highly, super hard get test (and still report at-home tests official data), they've botched Olympic torch run thing, they've banned foreigners, even they're vaccinated, coming see events they've trying protect first place. see they're going recoup Olympics sunk costs TV views alone, especially world anyone wants go outside see events person. go, 47.9% mortality people 40. Mine bad. I’d describe “mild hangover”. people trying hard spread nonsense situation Chile?

Look Israel's daily case graph. earliest steady, uninterrupted decline daily cases began Feb 8. point 68 doses per 100 people. Chile reached 64 doses per 100 people - way variants floating around % total infections. know fact vaccines least somewhat less effective variants. Also, expected 15% lower Pfizer/Biontech vaccine, expect decline pronounced start later well. mention Chile's vaccination campaign really took mid-March - again, check slope. Considering factors, would expect cases continue rising Chile *least* end lack obesity. infected virus, can't spread virus. Shit spontaneously appear. Wait. make sense? inevitably going get despite efforts made stay 6ft apart, wear mask, stay home? still would got it? misinterpreting this? media reporting, using .008% outliner cases wrapped ""scary"" headline. got second vaccine January 36 weeks pregnant. Coincidentally, son’s preschool shut covid outbreak week. day got second vaccine, husband came 103-degree fever lost sense smell. Fortunately, illness didn’t last long wasn’t really sick. assume got son. never got covid all. I’m glad got vaccine, hope baby girl protection antibodies well cant put efforts producing vaccines cause catastrophic clots? Thanks! I’m hoping won’t long approved Pfizer!   actual quote was: ""A likely scenario likely need third dose, somewhere six 12 months there, annual revaccination, needs confirmed. again, variants play key role,""  nightmare. feel bad people stuck Brazil taking seriously trying get sick. know people don’t like idea, since information coming covid-19 likely least _tweaked_ lab, think might byproduct that? (If lab stuff turns true)

It would explain lot. time, adenovirus vaccines widely used (mRNA hadn’t widely used, basically Pfizer Moderna vaccines). so, would interesting. Isn’t nh also like, got shots y’all come wherever get it? hilarious mention ""outdoors"" ""mask"" sentence people lose shit.

I'll masking outdoors long time come trigger y'all traumatized toddlers... us got used occupational reasons way happened. fun! honest admit belief; information I’ve personally seen. age misinformation(wether outright lie biased premature belief), it’s truly terrible thing. wish could share optimism, I'm fully expecting COVID theater continue many states well 2022. There's still well defined metrics ending many restrictions, including mask mandates.  Best luck — treatment come long way since time last year. Covid ruthless. hope makes it. sorry heard many stories people situation lost friends, even close family misinformation friends close anymore. really sad... come sort immunity liability, 
 would manufacturer kind medicine ever willingly take liability associated new medicine? Scientific advancement would stifled bc monetary concerns. good thing? Probably not. part FDA medical boards, right? protect general public neutral body study efficacy medicine. liable? gave okay, right? 

Also, nothing, coercion strong word. bc strong push vaccination mean anyone forced anything vaccine related. Societal pressure equal coercion. I’m sorry. hope vaccines help. Doesn’t sound long 15 year olds get it. 

I wish people understood it’s low death rates kids. take Tylenol? (Are allowed take Tylenol?)  Repeating “statistically” you’re comparing two unrelated numbers (deaths vs total population) doesn’t make right. Poland fucks going fine, go live life normally. ah thanks! suppose always figured pfizer moderna would sell nations soon enough though?? mean japan olympics coming vaccinated percent populous.

Here thing, nobody cares feelings. teachers doctors want risk lives deal children. real-world consequences getting sick. daycare either. wanted teachers back classroom directing anger anti-masker idiots talking lockdowns. 

Since country behave like adults lose privileges. Thats works. think someone else risk catching variant concern ending hospitalized killing unvaccinated family members mean to. Yep likely greatly reduces chance spread covid, scientists conclusively proved yet want say they're sure. Fuck yeah! Vaccine fully effectuated tomorrow. I'm invincible! Cool. antibodies fade lol sure us frustrated slowly virus work time time. Like could Thanksgiving surge weeks would long would take spread show up.

Lucky works ways, time mandate ending effect 55%+ state 80% immune more.

NH low deaths compared US average, lower cases winter, far lower deaths winter. masks still beneficial non vaccinated need mandate more. article written someone apparently understand vaccine efficacy calculated. No, it’s Federal program they’ll get paid. barriers Black people go through.

It’s also mRNA real king term experience think something like 30-40% somewhere range cell counts covid shots I'll say you, fuck em — adult fda application full approval. pediatric trials separate independent. Edit - 16+ exposed someone positive someone exposed someone else positive? latter, test coming back? would quarantine know status positive get test. Ideally want test 4-6 days exposure range. 

It possible vaccination provide protection, sort close line detectable data. actually know this. Many studies done exact topic. Long Covid essentially affects mostly preexisting conditions. kids, covid extremely mild almost every case. known. Don’t use kids excuse. important point. People like OP want argue full reopening masks let wash kids. bad get get infected? Thousands deaths? many hospitalizations MIS-C? Interesting news, thanks sharing!

Yeah that's getting question. could we'd better antibodies ready go keep C19 bay. right I'm sure could know yet. Drew Armstrong must really sore shoulders, absolutely carrying Twitter vaccine updates, everyday tweets thread US vaccine project going, changed.

 feel like Reddit fails realize West robust healthcare documentation system throughout world. West (North America, Western Europe, AU NZ) consistently tests most, general keeps relatively good records life death cycles. Many countries supposedly hit hard either consistently undertesting (re: Japan) third-world infrastructure keep track stuff well (re: India, Latin America). 

I'm saying countries worse West, obviously there's differences body count, saying West much transparent efficient healthcare documentation system. Consequentially, there's serious self selection going fact really document virus transmission impacts better countries. unvaccinated people **single household** low risk severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks physical distancing

only thing that's bit ""normal"" list safe regarding unvaccinated friends family. Pfizer Moderna shots objectively better AZ J&amp;J ones. saying latter terrible, comparison easy (if side effects, also efficacy, also understand subject lot variables sort evolving metric vaccines currently available). Yes; they'll get COVID instead, become immune way. Still helps run towards herd immunity; unnecessary deaths along way. 5ish days popping 90% less chance getting sick, getting symptoms, getting admitted hospital, dying 2 weeks 2nd Pfizer shot. 600k people matched control experimental groups. still chance bad outcomes, vaccine still amazingly teachers room students?

Yes vaccines working helping, can't deny Virus always outrun vaccine, especially couple people either forgoing mask wearing distancing feel they're entitled rules apply care etc. along state officials seeing dip cases green lighting everything go back normal right either. Last year US house fire, Jan March house fire extinguished extent, place still smoldering, see states opening things right again, i.e. lighting match, even vaccines, house go put back out. want restrictions forever, want live life see people again, means wearing mask distancing majority i.e. 70% minimum vaccinated, i'd rather keep going risk going shit 3 months now.

Factcheck.org list misleading claims made. real, billions people willing anything get vaccine right now, ungrateful mfers ignore it, people disgusting Im kinda getting annoyed Novavax efficacy SA stated 49%. 49% including HIV positive individuals, 55% not. vaccines weren’t trialed large cohorts HIV positive individuals. I’m pretty sure Novavax cause stipulation trial South Africa. balance risk continuing administer vaccine cost halting vaccinations.

In US vaccines available. Delaying J&amp;J doesn’t mean people won’t able get vaccinated. mean many people get vaccinated later otherwise would have. And, given number vaccines involved current death rate US, it’s possible people die result ~10M J&amp;J doses held up. 

An argument certainly made right thing continue hold vaccine, argument incomplete without considering potential deaths caused pausing J&amp;J vaccinations. wonder specific variant there. studies effect. dont agenda. want educate myself. happy hang day classroom 10 - 25 students five days week?

Someone understand virus spreads. We'll 44 million total doses delivered end June, including Janssen starts arriving end April. also almost half mil AZ sitting freezers Ontario used fast enough. Ya idk that.

Less 200 kids died covid US 2000 died brazil? cases high? Maybe conducting 1.5 million tests day. tests error rate. rate 5% means 75,000 tests produce false positive meaning potentially cases false. Interesting OP doesn’t want engage you. It’s valid point. hard comprehend folks may want wait something fully vetted approved?

408 distribution Biden. Trump gets credit throwing money every vaccine see stuck didn’t much plan actually distribute shots get arms. country restrictive mask mandate all.

New Zealand? die really screws government though, including efforts get everyone vaccinated? Government officials need early shots reason nurses need early shots, they're supposed working hard keep everyone else safe. Yep, plus still see people wearing mask driving alone. eyes roll pretty far back head see that.

What dropped someone cant roll windows down. dont understand need judge others actions dont bother anyone else.  Boomers got theirs. No-one else matters. profits made! hurting anyone wears passing someone? comfortable wearing mask let wear it. 
Constantly touching mask ideal anyway. Lot similar comments sub. idea. studies support this? Legit want educate myself. true TIL momemt me.  Depends much anti vaxxers affect life. Imagine alienated family wanting vaccine. safe effective mean, see Michigan numbers lately?

That's happens restrictions lifted vaccines still early stages given out.  sure, think studies looking now. far variant boosters go, think could potentially see booster existing formulations kind variant booster line. Lets say absolutely worst case happens start see protection levels falling ~9mo initial vaccination. situation might tempted try give third dose existing formulations higher risk populations try extend thay world vaccinated. I'm expert though, trying think strategic side things. really believe (and hope) protection ming lasting behind us soon, best prepared. That’s awesome! Congratulations! People’s reactions like 36,48hrs most. Like logic? body aches ~18 hours second Pfizer poke. 48yo male. horrible, glad I’m way fully immunized. Congratulations second dose! US Dept Defense study that. I’m sure spend time trying find it, will. here’s news article covered anyways: symptoms started around 18 hours 2nd shot. Lasted around 10 hours. felt like fever, didn’t temp. caved took Advil helped. 

Next day woke feeling though took cold medicine night - foggy like couldn’t drink enough coffee world wake up. ~2pm gone. around 28 hours, 12 hours bad side effects It’s funny think skeptical people mRNA vaccines cuz “new” tech is. article propaganda, 50k upvotes anti-vaxxers anti-vaxxers raise legitimate logical questions

so safe effective pause 2 them, ye right here. 

We two vaccines known serious downsides matter rare. Maybe come time, people going want Moderna Pfizer do. already impression J J less effective one shot. problem people already living like that, especially rural areas. “I never wore mask stopped living best life anyways, matter government person say don’t to?” attitude. Many talented individuals also awful egotistical, fair. US least lot places trouble filling appointments due vaccine hesitancy. Availability issue places, building trust vaccine important. Almost everyone come contact public work vaccine anyone else can’t careful stay home, keep distance, wear mask another week two get appointment that’s them. kept handing vaccine may problem that’s going hurt trust vaccines. show regulators taking (even small) risk seriously help build trust ones available. vaccine safe effective. turn, get vaccine. given right one you. vaccine cannot give COVID. part.  assume 

A. every Covid case catch, two infections miss (most estimates assume this)

B. People who've infected neither less likely get vaccinated anyone else. 

You calculate herd immunity thresholds formula

V + 3C(1-V) = 0.7

Where V percent people vaccinated C number cases. 

So home state Massachusetts (Which 9% population tested positive, \~27% population presumed infected), it's

V + 0.27(1-V) = 0.7

Which 0.589. words, 59% total population Massachusetts vaccinated, we'll herd immunity. We'll given first doses 59% population end month early May, vaccinations past letting us confident. I'm next week work. Guess I'll lol.  Let's hope article get retracted like fabricated hydroxychloroquine article influenced CDC's decision hydroxychloroquine.

Very interesting timing article. CDC never let happen here. It’s mask doomsday. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Fauci already saying masks thru 2022. real question (assuming blood clot rate lowballed):

How long increased risk last? 

Are people take AZ vaccine permanently higher risk (an unlikely worst case scenario)? Or, duration 2-3 weeks (the best case scenario)? get pretty close without outright forcing it. schools, colleges, military mandate it, help lot. could see jobs well. another country it, YAYYY, US it, ""well, make look good. /s Could imagine outrage Biden, democratic president, sent less vaccines republican areas? imagine would quite scandal That's villages everyone cares everyone else. take care other. don’t think much damage people think.

I don’t believe India’s numbers price tea China? Manaus variant, perhaps happen source? I’d like forward on. one really believe common good--and plenty do--it actually pretty bizarre think that's enough incentive itself.

Right. lots people, that's carrot. Getting life back normal, common good, concern family members health....that's good carrot gotten us far.



We getting point though need figure carrot stick everyone else. friends? 😂  56,000 tests day. 7,000 Tokyo.

Maybe they’re following rules doesn’t make complete , that’s understandable 

You suck . shouldn’t light fire keep others warm. Important lesson people well countries apparently. i’ll get many times need to, don’t really care 😂 wish people got vaccinated Michigan. Sure Canada receiving doses, Canadians sure Unless risk group, senior, native. 

Its weird say plans receive enough vaccines half population, still idea get one. Lol said Dad goes ""That's get nationalistic countries. least China shared."" audibly gasped mean he's also wrong, lol. guess helps crack outbreaks significant part population thinks mask = literal torture though.

We Germany also can't really crack outbreaks (well, can't leave house without good reason 9pm 5am would go?) also idiots go protesting masks lockdown measures. horse high all. Mine even signature. signatures nurses administered shots, though. Ah, coof nobody cares :) Sounds like different place give better results. Good luck happens again, third time charm! great another MAGAT wakco imflitrated Sub YAY STATE caveat: AstraZeneca vaccines also going expire soon either ways, US wouldn’t able use generally refer people let draw conclusions.

Of course not. father example opinion EU taxes paid (at least part) development vaccine though. I'm sure that's even true, good rebuttal it. studies released yet far know. would advise especially given J&amp;J offers robust protection 4 weeks vaccine. study ...and conspiracy theory? suggests it’s unbelievable? parroting something evidence for?

Amazing CIA head don’t consider conspiracy theory. think it’s worth investigating. Totally agree see around, definitely interesting. trust go ""I trust this, let check carefully"", trust get together majority go ""Yeah, seem able prove wrong right now"". said point view. Yeah, I'm going look Walgreens state run clinic next. deflating. I’m tired inside watching stupid commercials people pretending make this!!! swear hear another frontier commercial!!! agreeing you, better masking would enormous benefits. pandemic year still seeing people wearing stupid clear plastic shields sit inch away face. people really stupid? It’s countries jobs care citizens like it’s parents jobs care children. Parents absolutely prioritize children kids, doesn’t mean kids less important, means job taking care people direct responsibility. I’ve seen US vaccinations, it’s less certificate piece paper sticker indicating dates first second shot, personal information signature. eat raw cookie dough Reminds Borat song. “ Kazakhstan home Tinshein swimming pool. It’s length thirty meter width six meter. Filtration system marvel behold. remove 80 percent human solid waste.” could smashed reopened

No, would've bounced back almost immediately. unstable equilibrium vaccines. countries Europe. UK example way ahead. still exercise without going gym. cuz conspiracy yet see Conspiracy come true like Call Meta-Fanfiction 560k big number, one ever puts context appropriately.

We do. called horrible tragedy.

Yes, people desensitized countless deaths cars, obesity, etc. answer desensitization. Yeah, health care system. thousands them. Health care U.S. dysfunctional mess yet are. That's absolutely wild. Yep, pretty much core point. still know really bad contract, producers fucking sith whole EU bad luck, yeah, help all.
That said, nobody could known vaccine would fastest market, ""best"" (if wanna talk like sadly many many people do) cheapest ordering, spread risc last year. CurevAc troubles knew mutations already would enough vaccine give shots 24 hours day, sadly also happen June. Hey man, good. love discussions. You’ve least made think hope you. Nice get debate reasonable appropriate takes :) live? New Englands pretty covid cautious everything selling out. Feel like thats everywhere point Bats nocturnal agree you, nothing playing nice. EU oblige pharma companies first satisfy internal demand allow export vaccines. US that. EU fucked up. 3 months finalise deal AZ, selling cost. negotiate? Okay m'lady past said Germany AZ tested people 65 years old trials, unsafe give them. blood clots appeared say unsafe people 60 years old. leaves 60-65 years old never proclaimed unsafe. imagine public announcements help reputation AZ. 

But course government wants lot people get vaccinated fast, right enough vaccine everyone. one uses AZ, vaccinating whole population take even longer. try convince 60-65 years old years older age groups get AZ. would given choice right AZ Biontech/Moderna, practically one would choose AZ. give choice taking AZ waiting longer another vaccine lot people 60s want wait anymore. Overall strategy seems work quite high demand among people 60s AZ moment. past month know 3 people died South America. One 46. P1 definitely different. WATER KNOWN KEEP HYDRATED mention, much higher percentage idiots already exposed man said! No, don’t work like that. 

Oxford university reason mislead public. It'd success numbers real. They're not; test anyone. Again, risk seasonal flu well. There’s legitimate argument. Basically calculations say public health care would already cheaper even now. know kind weird know this, seeing looked American healthcare proposals german. group would like would private companies making money system. trying win benefit all. start looking enough me, bad sounds. Oh thanks apologizing, also sorry got little heated. Could've said jump, instead lied public caused mistrust experts science.

When bottleneck vaccines tell public ""vaccines help"" could prioritize elderly? simply say need prioritize elderly first get everyone else? But, new president shitposting Twitter every day. must mean plays lot golf nothing ... /s  reason take shoes TSA: security theater. referring healthcare system, since vaccine rollouts mostly logistics healthcare system issues, technology issues.  Merkel powerful women planet could Chosen whatever vaccine whenever wanted. Don’t naive. ""case rate ridiculously low."" test approximately noone. farce. CBC News interviewed two travellers, including Desharnais, say defied rules safety reasons yet receive fine.

Looks like empty threat. 2nd Pfizer dose. First one bad all. people stop tolerating it? mean parts US, restrictions never really enforced beginning unpopular. gradually crept suburbs even cities right-leaning areas. need invest heavily treatment therapeutics COVID-19, vaccines. need broad spectrum antiviral. AZ invested vaccine development production less PR investor communication.

[Blunders Eroded US Confidence Early Vaccine Front think Memorial Day weekend. government likely announce days before. don’t say anything advance. guarantee people even ones taken virus seriously say fuck shit soon. know have.  pay frogs Well, US, different administration downplaying virus. agreed comment quality education fields like medicine would noticeable difference quality received. everyones personal choice attend college pandemic, support everyones decision! Attending happened right choice me! Awesome, happy hear feeling better! Crazy Europe way behind US once.

Do think Europe ahead U.S. technology medicine? talking health care systems, medical science? could get one finding excess pharmacies. That's got mine. took lot poking around phone calls, worth it. either one, conscience clear lol single life countries worth less mine anyone else.

I fully agree. sad reality live world divided nations though. Vaccine nationalism makes much sense current geopolitical context. Lives worth regardless country rest world going pay economy taking 3-6 months recover.

In case think EU's strategy would worked AZ delivered massively Q1 (We got 31 million 100 million ordered). millions extra vaccine doses would put us comparable point least US still able feel good indirectly letting people die unlucky enough living different country. shame turn way. guys use masks indoor play date? US UK bought vaccines suppliers, without knowing would work.

The EU spent 3 months, trying get best contractual deals, even AZ selling cost (I.e free).

It nothing EU playing nice. No, don’t realize. really short sighted you. new cases last days? 200 cases Europe using AstraZeneca. hope symptoms similar less frequent AstraZeneca. 

Really hoping vaccine rolled like planned EU mean population immunized month earlier without J&amp;J. us, we're allowed register using college address--despite fact that's considered good enough residency register vote. viruses like happen rarely? stopping big pandemics happening every year basically time? evolved fight them? 

CDC raw data. Haha thanks, yeah agree. hope that's trend soon! mean HVAC systems important sanitizing surfaces? wouldn’t surprised didn’t mask mandates anywhere October. think it’s soon tell—we’ll see states’ big cities’ plans get summer. crazy number gets staggering think it. FASTER! Tell fossils congress mexican, hope borders open soon, mexicans canadians drive us get vaccinated lol covid cause point? Pfft, you’re afraid vaccine, know basement cowering fear covid. No. 74 deaths 77,000,000 full immunizations. Far better. statistically miniscule population 328 million people many new deaths COVID19. agree, there’s nuance media often misses - it’s “YOU STILL SPREAD” - it’s - don’t know spread. Probably can’t, like many things covid, experts say ‘we don’t know’ read hard true false. feel ok taking risk, I’m going back pre covid contact others research actually out.  mean ok.... that's marketing problem though addressed outside decision pause .... relevant either... It’s getting harder harder say fuck em is, sucks. get back giving J&amp;J shots. People dying. millions shots without problems happy safe. cringing idea mixed crowds masked unmasked grocery store: vaccinated wouldn’t need one aren’t would. like idea wear one vs wondering person without mask next vaccinated pretending been. share already, he? 2.5 million AZ Canada, thought. "" wear masks sick""

so sick WEAR MASK WORKS.

Also note knew asymptomatic infected common. 


They never said dont work misinformation fountain sub lost credibility perform cost-benefit analysis human lives failed correctly early months pandemic. 

Lol would anyone put credibility public subreddit first place? Exactly, yeah. People tend live close people matter what. no. stop blaming teachers doctors wanting work return normal incredibly badly also dont want risk lives families lives.

I want know, one vet another (your veteran covid war) thanks appreciation do.

I getting shot, eventually, absolutely.  i'm sorry think allergic reactions significant number shown phase 3 trials.... 

you'll probably access vaccines month less... there's harm waiting... ok kids can't vaccinated want careful ha start 4th wave. normally flu kills 60,000 people year US extremely bad year. COVID killed roughly 9 times amount past year. COVID killed kids slightly double amount flu normally does.

This means kids far lower risk adults. believe worry push potential boosters. many people getting vaccinated many various strains spreading increasing chance mutation vaccines protect adequate level for... salute 🖖 Yes get dose 2 tomorrow that's one I'm scared ab. people group reported dose 2   two things mutually exclusive. Yes, covid kills people. However, kill seriously injure vast, vast majority people catch it. That’s point. 

Yes, *could* die covid yes people died covid, anywhere even approaching *likely* die covid. That’s I’m trying say. people catch covid *are* sick days. Doged often struggle hear people wearing mask, hearing really even bad. really feel hearing impaired greatly depend lip reading. I'm bit torn.

On one hand really sucks.

On hand, first I've heard project confirmed, I'm pretty stoked it.

Which reminds need get around watching third season Discovery, suppose... real problem lack clear defined criteria meet put end things. Unsurprisingly, New Zealand right, gave public specific numbers would mean specific restrictions longer needed. US answer always ""we know"" - know many people need vaccinated hit herd immunity, know cases drop, know far deaths fall vaccination efforts, know percentage we'll hit people willing get vaccine, et cetera et cetera et cetera. 

That's true, know things sure, also issue hand, know keep saying keep accepting answer. example, want know number daily cases, nationally and/or locally, means one needs wear mask anymore. level hospitalizations means gather freely. number deaths means concerts sports events exist again. know people ballpark number head they're looking for, say it? care many people need vaccinated get there, exactly think we'll get there, even realistic number is, shit. tell number there's defined point over. sad ignorant people Tell families 500 plus thousand dead know, catch get sick days ;) Keep fighting good fight  know ISNT going help us get there? Telling people aren’t going free even get vaccine, bother.  but. Can’t mention subreddit can’t discuss incompetence might hurt people’s feelings. want blood clots either? goodness. scares me. globalized world is, spawn Covid mutant much deadly could affect whole world. You’re describing basic immunology, knowing doesn’t mean you’re qualified make claims immunity ""did everything right"" Except Coronaviruses don’t mutate near frequently flu.   I’ll drink that, man. I’m fuckin hoping I'm disagreeing low, also cover pool, so... I'm taking preventive measures order become statistics. know, get vaccinated, put seat belt, cover pool, teach kids swim early. covid preventive measure moment social distancing, masks etc. Personally, although see point, draconian extreme measures.

. Oh come rubbish. dumb. can't stay lock forever, that's life. vaccine safe, except people.

Seriously, no-brainer. People smoke, consume drugs stuff way higher risk cause clots, yet everyone goes crazy vaccine ridiculous small chance causing clot. Ah... Notre Dame, confirms forever dream school, shame I'm poor, american... really smart lol much agree you, case first experienced asymptomatic infection later manifested long term effects? 


It's unreasonable suggest may also occur children.  


Admittedly, small number general begin with. Chicago still fucked, everyone wearing masks outdoor walks plenty distancing, fucking hate actually backwards - journalists explain science you, report words statements scientists. *often* words theoretical, contradictory, confusing. scientists still people, science composed *don't* know. claim making decisions based science statistics. This! NOBODY talking getting antibody test vaccine?! Good article. agree advice experts. 

Tl;dr

Kids around vaccinated adults shouldn’t around unvaccinated kids adults indoors without mask. Oh you’re fan COVID? Name every epitope. Or, far likely option, take mask off, go day, you’re vaccinated catch covid, get sick days you’re fine like 99% people catch covid. 

Or you’re one 56% people NH received least one dose vaccine, take mask off, go life normal *absolutely nothing bad happens.* Thank god someone ran opposing story consistently fear mongering media feed today cases covid vaccination. think irresponsible extremely negative vaccine uptake promoting vaccine hesitancy. 
Before everyone jumps band wagon “well would prefer hide information report?” suggestion dressed click bait titles without context opposing information lead many people skimming feed, quickly conclude “well look thought fishy vaccines aren’t good”. - wanting get vaccinated also really, really taking pandemic seriously abiding guidelines much possible. “God grant courage change minds anti-vaxxers can, serenity accept minds can’t change, wisdom stay fuck away them.” Dude taken tylenol actually made pain worse. least advil kicks tylenol ass. got second shot wasnt advil made worst morning second shot. it’s county, state, FEMA run, aren’t going ask insurance, pretty sure. went w/ parents clinic run local private hospital system (possibly hospital system rural county, actually), lucked extra dose didn’t fill appointments, ask whether insurance. separate county health department clinics county, pretty sure still fully funded state California vaccination efforts county. Nothing website said bring insurance info one it. 

At Walgreens second dose, website say bring insurance info it, one asked, form, local Walgreens don’t appear care getting reimbursed. roughly speaking, seems case. Unsurprisingly, leads people different conclusions - regardless ideological “side” pandemic on. recent study found that, least along partisan lines, [Republicans tended underestimate COVID risks Democrats tended overestimate COVID point is, easier this, there's excuse be. _shouldn't need spend 5 minutes make appointment._ valid reason harder ordering pizza dinner ordering next shipment shit Amazon. get stat 5 million new cases since feb 1? don’t know get data. Yep pragmatic, country's ability avoid certain vaccines privilege itself. think transparancy important thing though, builds trust elected officials making decisions giving context decisions made media. Messaging researchers always terrible. reporting statements made, statements place. Update: Live Free die say goal, ideal.

It's sufficient memory cells get sick, prevent infection. infected longer means chance evolution. Actually much safer time take newborn normal year influenza infections going around. Covid least concerns 5. Hard convince people rational choices. hit 70% vaccine appointments open anyone, open up. I'm going put life hold keep antivaxxers alive.  simply true.

""The data showed 4 every 1 million people get American-made vaccines experience cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), blood clots brain. AstraZeneca vaccine, works different way similar the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, research showed incidence rate 5 every 1 not..... folks want get vaccine (because approved yet), mandatory test lets prove they're healthy.

Also, even folks vaccine, mandatory test hits concern point infected person showing up. vaccinated person still get COVID, non-vaccinated person still healthy. drop registry bullshit rapid tests door concerned (and aim hit point everyone cares vaccinated anyway, say fuck drop whole thing). use logic justify leaving restrictions place, restrictions continue indefinitely.

Which exactly many people want ending adherence restrictions earlier optimal. Unless you’re 85 yr old multiple co-morbidities, wouldn’t worry What? last .008% lick every doorknob handrail sight? feel win lotto? media keep trying scare everyone, much fucking damage willing do, don’t give fuck world getting better, want fucking profit fair, there's essentially 0 chance spreading COVID outside thought vaccine already declared safe? get ""back track"" from? Uh, live? city, 99.9% population follows them. CDC considering mixing vaccine considers emergency. get vaccinated exposed COVID-19 day next day, vaccine effective? Meaning- exposure ruin body's chance developing good immune response vaccine?

I got Pfizer yesterday son came home runny nose, developing ""I'm feeling sick"" time went bed. He's getting test morning, I'm freaking COVID ruined vaccine less effective somehow exposure prevent body developing proper immune response.

The United States certainly doesn’t give shit sharing vaccines even though sitting millions Astra Zeneca doses hasn’t even approved country. add cherry top shit sundae stopped exporting raw materials vaccine manufacturers countries need produce vaccine. tell playing eye eye here? need march streets people. literally keep us alive. Give damn raise benefits. Ah mind single anecdote proves can't get covid enclosed spaces. OK.... don’t think anyone contests that. question bat transmit humans? wet market theory? “bats cave” theory? bat transmit pangolin used Chinese traditional medicine? lab leak theory? follow question. held lower standard someone already qualified? invested school ready higher education passed someone less qaulified? employer hire someone less qaulified?  48 hours past second Pfizer shot - feeling good! 

Yesterday haze *extreme* fatigue, brain fog random body aches (the latter easily controlled Tylenol), good night's sleep last night, feeling back normal. 

My husband got hit little harder - body aches seemed severe, fell asleep 8 last night sleep 7 morning, he's feeling good too. 

So ready get back sense normalcy. Thank you, science! germany never actual lockdown, dude. pandemic! assure never thought would care children pandemic. parents want care kids - exhausted drained trying figure fuck best little guidance. Oh like everyone else expecting collective truama alive time. God damn, cut parents slack. vaccines highly effective. everyone vaccinated risk extremely low. 

That plus outdoors masked.

Edit: I'd also add, shame anyone shaming you. wedding post vaccination risky. 

Comment got removed, said removed word people would shame this. technically happened yesterday evening, figured I'd wait today new DT free Karma muahah

Fully vaccinated! girlfriend too! ""Having covid grants 80% immunity"" would fine headline. first suggestion obviously meant ironically specific Thank you. I'm scheduled second Moderna dose today. hearing I'll need 3rd shot I'm really loss. got mild tinnitus dose 1, side effect reported small number people. Covid much higher chance giving tinnitus. pharmacist said since know I'm prone side effect reason, probably woudl hold dose 2. I'm getting anyways new variants rough sound, hope I'm making huge mistake setting knows long severe tinnitus. definitely way underreported though Indoor spaces crazy dangerous aerosolized viruses like covid. Outdoors lot better, catch hanging around crowds without mask. Low density people outdoors good breeze, bother, unless cases spiking control time. 

This spot-on. what? thats said. number tells much chances death reduced get vaccine get coronavirus, vs dont get vaccine get coronavirus. normaly 0.1% people gets coronavirus dies, vaccine going 0.02%.   weekly death rate US 3/4 Germany trending down, US lowest point ever. awesome! one get? Public vocational high schools don’t necessarily neglect academics. kids still take English math. usually fewer offerings terms advanced/honors/AP courses, sure. aren’t shop day.

Have looked course offerings local vo-tech? asked administration additional resources academically advanced kids, son falls category? schools pay take courses local community college, example. majority people world believe pseudoscience. much changed 10,000 years general public. Even 90+ percent scientists crazy superstitions. Ah yeah I'm considering it'd lot. We'd forgo rather large deposit find somewhere months notice take vendors. That's good know lax suburbs right though! fair, there's essentially 0 chance spreading COVID outside 

That's true. lot less inside, probably still amounts large number cases (though still small fraction total cases). that's also lot riskier outdoors activities shut times (contact sports, concerts, dining, etc). 

 systematic review published studies transmission novel coronavirus respiratory viruses, Razani colleagues found **less 10 percent cases described spread outdoors.** also found frustratingly papers detailed settings clearly compared indoor outdoor situations.  takeaway it’s impossible get infection outdoors, even though published, clearly proportion happens much lower,” Razani said. added: “If going beach — beautiful thing — avoid times it’s crowded, mask, Plan B.” Scroll down, genius.

Look chart. couple day decline trend. normal fluctuation.  Selfish wrong word herd/msm mentality. People choose get shot likely already exposed virus immune. largely booster shots variants guess. Curfews definitely private gatherings; lot places probably still operating based studies fall said transmission due gatherings. curfew probably seems appealing governments easy way reduce gatherings across board rather waiting someone snitch one try fine people involved. That’s maybe German way this. post picture official papers. ;) gods sake, man! Supermarkets *ne-ces-sa-ry*! word EU deliveries?

Edit: EU deliveries track - Georgia enters chat.  La hosting Olympics three years public transportation last time hosted Thank you! I'm going look signing 9 5 year olds, 2.5 year old high risk (born severe anaphylactic food allergies, they've reduced SLIT therapy thankfully). Oh, gods sake. difficult understand!

The curfew prevents idiots going places idiots socialize them! preventing people walking around alone outside! well agree. however, world usa, uk, israel, bhutan. mean... government does. approved Canada. reason wouldn't. Also judging vaccine purchases, like Trump administration flawless job something. actually passed Pfizer purchase one point.
 eventually purchased 200M Pfizer 200M Moderna, still enough. Biden administration needed purchase another 200M each. absolutely obvious curfew prevents social interactions.

How else would one check people going meet people? didn’t take consideration Taiwan island nation well? Thank Oh, gods sake. difficult understand!

The curfew prevents idiots going places idiots socialize them! preventing people walking around alone outside! Sounds like shit hole country

2016 2020. 

Let's hope turn back era/error again. mysteriously untouched first wave, like countries. 

The Japanese government bragged [Japanese people many researchers around world investigated hypotheses Japanese infected similar virus recent past, something diet way life protected them, even cultural etiquette protecting them.

Turns no, got lucky, like countries spared first wave they've back foot ever since. feel like dont fat. We've known weight correlated serious covid complications. seems align seeing regular exercise likely weight therefore serious covid complications counterparts.

Asking EU (Czechia concrete) I'm sure angry, article mention 0.2% risk children comorbidities getting severe covid, may immediately cause death given current data probably give child life-long medical issues shortened lifespan. Regardless, vaccines approved children's age group, would need less severity virus itself. wrong, choices keep everything locked open boomers, help anyone choose first even second seems unfair. Germany even locked properly, cancelled Easter lockdown political pressure. whole argument stupid. yes, know referring that. ignoring context, though, making argument can't lose. Depends definition ""most world"". Good luck finding anybody wearing mask outside Latin America Africa. Hell, might trouble finding people wearing masks inside lot places. well get one shipped overnight EU  case around 20% vaccinated still 50% go get sort immunity, variants concern there. like saying half race done, declare victory stop. Adenovirus receptors platelet surface. publication 2006 goes detail: , make money make friends. They're mutually exclusive. mean need go back in, okay miss hours game night.

I like fact different random social groups. Living rock? news? can’t wake without hearing body count. Ok chances actually getting covid 100%. fact even United States one worst places, 10% population infected. words year choose get vaccinated chances getting rare brain blood clots fact lower get vaccinated AstraZeneca j&amp;j.

However talking extremely rare event cases. Far common inconvenient potentially disabling symptoms covid like chronic fatigue loss smell.

Your chances getting 30% get covid means 3% general. there's chances dying... sounds like Moderna saying something similar. wonder also true J&amp;J. pandemic virus mostly laughs said 1) Yes, called herd immunity, claim otherwise. %100 effective reach herd immunity, unfortunately know percentage exactly (yet).

2)R(t) reproduction number given date (t). R0 reproduction number day zero (the beginning outbreak unknown, restrictions obviously community-wide immunity/antibodies). cannot reduce R0 1, reduce R number given moment.

3) R number estimate moment 1 shows that, time, infections slowing. guarantee go way, due vaccines, restrictions, personal precautions seasonality etc.. understand vaccines enough lift restrictions observe R still one. forecast R future, might seen, forecasts almost always wrong. 

4) time, seen Texas lifted way earlier stage vaccination, suffer massive surge, however Michigan does. shows well-know percentage threshold vaccine coverage, also depends lifestyle, density, social gatherings, weather countless parameters. Would make sense vaccine creating antibodies fight virus causes blood clots would cause blood clots *especially* non-MRNA vaccines like AZ J&amp;J? law big numbers. increase sample size, get closer closer true value. studies gave us 90-95% effective rate done across dozens thousands people, sixty six million. 

Also, roughly 20% population vaccinated compared pretty much 0% studies done, chances encountering someone also vaccinated (and thus, unlikely pass virus you) much, much higher Phase 3 trials. Good, leave us alone.

Come back 5-10 years FDA approved April 30th day 100. We're gonna blow past 200m doses mark. Germany's cases spiking stupid people vaccines 60. I’m Hungary, told what’s available. recently one, choose mostly Astra Sputnik. decide take (or latter choose) generally urge take whatever instead waiting Pfizer/Moderna shortage reserved certain groups people, usually say vaccine better catching COVID (cases high). think that’s fair, get picking choosing, know worry certain shots overblown, believe one needs right know goes body, refuse they’re comfortable that. Interestingly though, know 3 people refused offered (Astra/Sputnik) got Pfizer within week. that’s local small sample size. Since using shots approved EU (Sputnik Sinopharm) think lot people right refuse convincing register first place. condition take whatever offered, many people skeptical certain shots would decided get vaccinated all. read article. pretty depth discussion Intellectual Property rights regards vaccines Gates' ardent defense contributing huge delays many countries. say 2024 global herd immunity reached which, **importantly**, gives virus lots time mutate fight another day. Pretty ironic and, again, kind criticism typically hear. wackos think he's shoving vaccines everyone's throat even guy engineered whole crisis. posted article I'm generally pro Gates heard anything this.

Yeah agree pic peculiar choice. figured poke *Gates literal devil* rhetoric there. Yup! Yay us! hard things! antivaxxer, fake science nonsense?

No, that's way works. Vaccines great protecting individual, community. Well reports “fully vaccinated” people infected. 
Also half, don’t get flu vaccine wouldn’t call ignorant even passed flu. risk everything. That’s absolutely true. Learn vaccinations work. trick body producing antibodies virus. antibodies protect others.

If you’ve virus recovered antibodies naturally. Antibodies antibodies.

This direct doctor. 

Stop spreading misinformation. makes statement hypothetical situation polarizing it’s stated time mass vaccination yet message still “wear mask still don’t know well vaccine works”. time, many places it’s impossible get appointment. We’re told order move need vaccinate x% people. Yet many people screaming “yes want get back normal want vaccine. roll vaccination process disaster, can’t get back normal can’t streamline process “

Now tell need go process fall. can’t figure it’s hot topic? secret memo health care workers dangerous vaccine side affects would entire 24hr news cycle guy made money Windows damnest kill Linux existential threat might bit biased IP issue. correct say we'd still expect 10% entire population come COVID.

You right correct say this, say that. said expect x% population (which 10% hypothetical) still susceptible. susceptible simply means possess sterilizing immunity disease could still fall ill and/or spread disease exposed sufficient dose infectious agent. I’m worried getting side effects county hasn’t Covid death since Feb 25th today’s case count 2. also fairly large private college within county. THRILLED!   really good news poll public confidence Pfizer Moderna unchanged. holds true could mean issues J&amp;J might much impact US vaccination rate.  outdoor mask mandates crazy. remember scientists saying outdoor transmission rare start. Ive always ripped mask soon leave store. idea mandated outside time saw repeal recently. know much sunlight affects vitamin levels, mask hurt that? could totally wrong, I'm would that? Vitamin extremely important, especially comes covid. True, though least respect we've learning better treat people become infested show symptoms. Unfortunately really know long term effects virus body even asymptomatic people.

The biggest worry point imo better idea long term effects needing worry reinfection even catching Covid recovering. Combined fact know long vaccines provide protection puts us really awkward spot. We're understandably trying get many people possible vaccinated fight pandemic best medical community knows handle things know could ""finish"" vaccinating many people find year protection provided vaccines longer effect end repeating everything again.

Personally extremely happy able get first dose vaccine today family friends least first dose still feels like we're long way away really even starting think ""beat"" Covid worldwide scale. Well Israel peak cases around 1.5 month ago, makes sense people still dying that. 

So can't compare based population, need compare also many people infected when. risk blood clots? Lol. can't math either seems.

1300 times difference 130000%, 1300%.

And 1300 times number arrived wrong, would imply vaccines 99.99% effective preventing infection, not, 90-95% effective. better brain's reaction, ""Beer? Yay! Oh bud. Boo."" Getting vaccinated seriously viewed patriotic duty opinion. part help fellow citizens. 

I mean statement overly dramatic. seriously believe it. us get get helping smaller number can’t get it. Like kids. medical issues (if exist) stops them. 

I don’t need rant people “be fine”. I’m saying talk hear freedom love country, one way literally prove it. make choice something help country live it. end everyone Russian Sputnik V beginning - two vectors. outweigh risks

Fam, take vaccine done research. research I'm pretty sure I've done US least one time. point, simply needed. need mass vaccination site Dodger Stadium walk Walgreens LA County get vaccine. mass sites less convenient, convenient - better distributing lots vaccines supplies really, really limited. Within last week, J&amp;J shot got cancelled Pfizer vaccinated wife (both shots/zero side effects) found may need third. Oh little restrictions lifted. I’m starting agree you. agree become politicized sides, say constantly taking mask putting back bad practice itself. guilty way. really, experts talking masks work slow transmission, usually assumption wash hands before, put mask on, touch mask on, wash hands take wash hands again, on.

Plus, also annoying mask constantly thinking enter shop get busy street part something. Followed big indoor party lol primary goal clinical trials COVID-19 vaccines show whether vaccines prevent symptomatic infections and, cases, moderate severe trials weren’t designed show whether vaccines also block asymptomatic infections — don’t cause new Covid-19 vaccines Pfizer Moderna seem remarkably good preventing serious illness. it’s unclear well curb spread Pfizer Moderna trials tracked many vaccinated people became sick Covid-19. leaves open possibility vaccinated people get infected without developing symptoms, could silently transmit virus — especially come close contact others stop wearing masks. magically mean people areas actually use them? need go demand period. ideally would demand places Haha get ! Booya masking social distancing 100% effective stopping transmission, vaccination free easy way make protection even robust slow spread disease.

It also allow return normalcy, even still wear mask. Today, missing ingredient dish making even hesitate swing store one thing. done vaccinated; making trip unless full cart! point probably virus hangs air like expelled breath. much breathe depends whether indoors close virus shedder. given J&amp;J Saturday still mild pain lift arm head. mild skin reaction around vaccine site light bruising, pretty much gone soreness remained now. global pandemic

This removes credibility whatever wrote Thank wish Cuomo would stick number it. ""at 60% we'll lift restrictions""

Might get fence sitters jump wear masks Walmart. could mean people would otherwise unaffected COVID die blood clots otherwise have? 

It's fine see lesser two evils start actually think numbers real, breathing people willing risk lives others. F that. go Los Angeles, Chicago New York first.

Once big cities fill, go neighbors. also huge country barely made dent vaccination efforts. seriously never getting Covid world. true. whole situation continues suck bad busch lonestar though That's there's online payment processing

Otherwise would say vaccines 99.99% effective preventing infection. lot people pissed still wear masks completely justified vaccinated still forced wear one. Yea. lots disincentives businesses require staff. mean life dangerous. survivability everyone age 65 greater 95%.

Thank taking time answering question readers. wasn’t fine. entire studio 150 kids fine!! It’s like much choice...they limited number vaccines available you! I've got shot, I've got nothing worry about.

But ""they got far, must set"" comically terrible argument. Forbes low-quality information now? slow Asia. honest, vaccine vaccine, Japan's government shown interest seriously combatting pandemic. lucked population whose heads completely asses like US, EU, UK, Mexico, Brazil, India, etc. think it’s important keep things mind here. Yes, breakthrough infections vaccination — however, number quite low. know vaccinated people less likely transmit covid. vaccines FDA authorization provide 100% protection death critical illness.

Your percentages related infection rate bit off, well. Using 89% efficacy percentage, mean grandparents 11% chance getting covid upon exposure. means 89% reduced chance contracting covid. instance, attack rate covid within household (ie: one spouse gets covid) around 40%. even household member catches covid, vaccinated person would 40% -89% chance becoming infected all, 11% chance getting disease covid 100% attack rate. 

Only decide what’s best family situation. now, probably foreseeable future, allowing vaccinated adults around children likely safe get, unless want completely sever contact anyone outside household. risk not, never be, zero. Keeping things like risk level feasibility mind long term — kids vaccinated, — really important, well awareness control behavior. It’s nice constant “what going say today” back head like used to. interesting. Brazil extremely high rate caesarean births. 90% private hospitals.

Kids die covid rate large enough bother caring. Look whats happening kids Brazil, yeah, keep ignoring it. obviously true, since virus tends collect upper nasal tract moving upper respiratory area. nose PRIMARY means getting infected, mouth too, much much less. like maybe ...2028?

:D googled rule found nothing. Yeah shaking stylish, yet affordable boots. son male ballet dancer. peak health. dies covid everyone would die Covid. 

So give stats many healthy children comorbitites died covid? I’ll wait. country 90% wear noses. see results worldmeter Poland. :( flu dangerous covid children. lock forever? mostly due high vaccine hesitancy US compared high vaccine uptake UK.

Are stats vaccine hesitancy statistically USA? totally believe it, wondering actual estimates were. here. Im getting point though either need invest fair amount equipment, need start going gym. dont enough weights, certain machines leg day really limiting. bad subtype blood clot (way worse normal DVT), compare Covid morbidity/mortality vaccine great.

All cases younger women also least think Men elderly shoud get it.

This pause likely cause people generally want J J likely lot people shun vaccines together unfortunately many people think rationally. People fully vaccinated whatever want get anyone sick.

~40 hour 

40/330,000,000 = 4/ 33,000,000 agree math pathetic. said find rate unvaccinated people got covid period time. Regardless numbers going show serious efficacy. No, don't. US reaches herd immunity immunization, measures control spread longer necessary enforced. read without creating account No, 1/3 Americans infected last months. 

In fact, vaccine rollout setting records lately. Go back months many people fully vaccinated (remember, takes 6 weeks fully vaccinated). 

A tiny percentage Americans infected last weeks - months, people vaccinated. ""Dodging"" COVID since, what, late February something vast, vast majority Americans done, vaccinated not. horrible phobia needles used regularly avoid getting flu shot. sure similar boat offer perspective.

I got first moderna shot 3 weeks ago. Told person giving ""wasn't good needles"" looking it. made joke men like that, said already done shot putting bandage it. Literally feel prick, sting, anything all.

The side effects definitely real, pretty manageable (and everyone gets them). woke next morning low fever, fatigue, mild headache soreness injection site. lasted 36 hours, seemed like eternity time, normal immune response. luxury able take day work, would so.

However, real COVID month half ago -- way worse. need hospitalized, 7 days feeling like absolute shit, brain fog lingering issues week two ago. vaccine side effects like equivalent one day mild covid symptoms. 

If lucky enough gotten COVID yet, would jump chance get vaccine. still scares exactly know yet virus serious damage lungs body, 100% wish able get shot weeks earlier avoided stress. None far aware. know death negative consequence Covid-19 right? better question would be, many people vaccinated spread Covid-19 others fell ill? know healthy vaccinated individuals unlikely spread Covid-19, far aware, vaccinated individuals still become sick still capable infecting people. sure countries, Canada contracts them. However could chosen use export controls block anyway. 

They forever grateful it. We’ve multiple covid positive fully vaccinated folks hospital. every one immunocompromised 90+ years old.  NH like 55% w/ First dose low population density big cities.

Honestly point viruses generally becoming less deadly become contagious meant general statement viruses general specifically Covid. saying ""true"" agree really applicable Covid due nature virus. Beyond yes changed subject since really much talk regard agree statement.

Ideally long term I'd like believe potential mutations could result resilient less deadly variants Covid surviving turns constant recurring ""seasonal"" disease similar Flu honestly admit concrete evidence support likely scenario. real bright side we're least learning combat virus extent current vaccines treat people get serious symptoms.

Edit: saw comment guess tried already. sucks. seen bits nasal vaccine developed would great. Exactly. right long term effects concerning even kill you. But, know long term effects caused vaccine? don't, new that's biggest reason yet FDA approved approved emergency use. enough time test long term effects.

Actually will, eventually. within reasonable time frame. reason suspect coronavirus simply mutate cold, like human coronavirus, given enough time. time unrealistic keep social distancing masks (and would definitely trigger depression 1930s-esque proportions) would *eventually* become another cold. Buy one can, also use store/sell dippin dots? (I think need like -40 tho). two larg RCT studies Xlear carregean nasal spray South America health care settings  80% effective preventing COVID.

We know nasal sprays work colds, including seasonal coronaviruses well. I'd guess probably works well enough post exposure prophalaxis. 150,000,000+ already vaccinated US alone. (Including Pfizer's)

At point cover hide behind, admit scared needle. large portion people shoot messenger instead listening message. people would theoretically enforce things can't bothered buddies Facebook said take anyway. Maybe maybe not. Texas removed mask mandates things didn’t worsen. it’s guaranteed make case rate worse Well since Reddit American-based, I’ve never London Europe Pennsylvania, appreciate it. It’s comparison comment, like article said (unless oof). case we've also lost ability put perspective comes low risk COVID severity.

I virus Sept 2020 mild symptoms. According blood test took recently April 2021, doctor said still strong antibodies blood.

So, risk perspective:

a) I'm protected antibodies

b) Even weren't, COVID symptoms mild caught again, I'm low risk severe COVID (not overweight, diabetic, meds, immunocompromised, high Vitamin levels).

So, take risk non-FDA approved vaccine right now? doctor said take time taking risk based approach. reddit statisticians counter doctor here? Brave soul, voted heavily speaking facts luck might hit elusive herd immunity number completely open anyway. Jesus fuck, ONE wants god-damned mask mandate lockdown. difference people broke-brained pay attention reality. also wear masks common courtesy, don’t mandated. assuming anti-vaxxers cooperating first place?

You naive troll? live EU directly affected yes vaccination happen soon, good outlook given 2 kids school P1 seems slowly get grip EU countries well, top coming B.117 wave slowly also evading south african variant lingering (which make much inroads yes thanks B.117), yes personally pissed well. Question is, illegal not, best effort clause little big fishy sides see differently.

But anyway, AZ basically lost entire EU booster shots shennanigans.

People get Pfizer/Moderna whatever AZ autumn upcoming season. Cross vaccination seems safe enough, Germany approved younger people got first shot AZ get second jab Biontech/Pfizer.

Given EU probably would pay lot AZ boosters (the first shot basically self cost, upcoming boosters not, knowledge). AZ lost billions long term strategy.

Not mention tanked reputation reliable partner upcoming things! remembered long time even regions!

They basically lost entire potentially high paying first world except Great Britain one! Every drug dealer street businesswise intelligent AZ management, seems me!

And nothing reported blood clot issues, reliable partner constantly dropped shipment estimates others always delivered time production EU soil, sending local politicians corner never wanted first place! Im curious confidence behind new vaccines, common medicine, case vaccines, show side effects within short amount time, hence confidence behind things? things shown side effects many months years later?

Just trying understand stuff better. read much stuff sometime it’s hard absorb overwhelming amount information Pfizer/Biontech declined funding OWS fund research, took funding manufacturing, Well like this: CDC's numbers, people 45 incredibly low risk death. There's issue ""long covid"" quite well documented literature symptoms seem psychosomatic. So, vaccines effective, 45 able choose whether get without judgement - they're hurting don't

I see moral duty argument come often, hear it, think getting vaccine would make one immoral. people really concerned morality expect us demand every politician follow mandates reprimanded. 

What hardest time coming grips idea one supports vaccine automatically terms moral/intellectual standing. highly problematic and, ironically, immoral. Wasn’t Biden’s goal 100M vaccines first 100 days? risk death COVID people think about. reports long term complications like heart damage, infertility, neurological symptoms, cardiovascular problems, future affinity blood clots, etc, surviving patients. rare potentially related, enough scares associated COVID value peace mind comes knowing everything could protect myself. orders vaccines use today placed Biden last year? you’re condescending b*tch volunteered get shots ahead workers communities.

Karma catches people like sooner later. kidding. 9 months ago, who’d thought thrilled we’d Biden presidency? couldn’t less enthusiastic president look administration. I’m floored. THIS.

Instead people took unnecessary risks justified saying ""I'm young healthy, problem"". Sign right up, Joe! I’m fully vaxxed looking forward 12 mos shot. annually flu shot also. I’m guessing eventually, flu covid one shot. Saying ""we die something"" ""if God's will"" going pilgrimmage holding political rallies going help one bit. going take toll... offer nice egg trying time? case, risk catching COVID would 1/8; tell total infection rate USA 1/10 someone who's taking precautions like masking distancing, almost certainly even less. 

Also factor someone refuses AZ (which even approved yet US AFAIK, let's pretend sake argument), they'd catch Covid-19 small window moment refused AZ jab day they're offered shot Pfizer. risk catching virus small amount time, especially taking precautions, much smaller 1/10. US getting 32.8 million Covid-19 cases 2-4 weeks. fair Trump allows liars work administration. 🤷‍♂️ let’s face people saying shit get work cushy 6 figure job home stupid stop vaccinations this...   announce ""FREE - today only!!!""

Yes, Merkel, ""doesn't forgive hesitation"". puppet Ursula delayed purchase vaccines campaign european federalism. government change medieval bureaucracy allow AZ doses gather dust shelf. seem learned nothing since March 2020, keep Plan harder harder. coronavirus pandemic United States turned patchwork regional hotspots, states hammered surge infections hospitalizations even others seen crisis begin ease. spring wave pandemic driven hospitalizations 47,000, highest since March states reported increase past week number people hospitalized covid-19, disease caused virus, according Washington Post analysis data provided Department Health Human national statistics don’t capture intensity coronavirus emergency hotspots. Michigan reported 10,000 new infections Tuesday alone. state Wednesday reported average 46 deaths day, 16 month earlier. make decent point. 15 year old. saying I'm better vaccinated? Lol. always greatest fear. US cases plummeting, tests available, India grabbing up. numbers high 200,000, testing rates 1/1000 new time high. rate lower US since around April last year, rate around 400% lower US’s average full year, India 400% population. 

I remember story 1 man city testing positive major city early pandemic, told quarantine. days later 40,000 suspected cases, testing, testing would mattered. sounded exactly like Albany, GA situation, hospital capacity went sub-5% overcapacity within 48 hours suspected cases, testing, Atlanta prioritized testing, media coverage. little reporting anomalies time.

India almost certainly 1m+ daily infection averages course months, multimillion infection daily averages sustained periods well. never testing prove bad really was. I’d surprised less quarter-billion infections. I’d imagine it’s closer half billion. 

I don’t like idea 23 getting vaccinated US, already getting extremely mild-covid August less, meanwhile there’s hundreds millions billions people globally need me. hate really.

I don’t know US makes world leader simultaneously hanging everyone else dry. We’re vaccinating TEENAGERS greater risk flu. Meanwhile Canada, South America, Europe getting ravaged. African nations, Middle East, Southeast Asia probably getting bad, don’t tests prove it. That’s leader anyone follow. makes genuinely nauseous. certainly case? California average vaccine distribution? Last checked top 15 first doses specifically.

Health equity important, especially given communities hit hardest COVID. 10 worst states terms vaccine doses used Republican btw. guess Alabama cared much health equity! Yeah vaccines know Benares people don’t want 15 year old. 16 year old vaccinated, 15 year old. much difference, physiologically speaking. land Russia Europe kept original virus bay whole time, variants came population antibodies opened everything. weeks closed schools restaurants would fine love way Economist graphs. Maybe numbers good many people wearing masks. could change many people stop.

Frankly, think Sunni get summer tourists state, especially Massachusetts keeps mask mandate. admits there’s surge cases hospitalizations, encourages everyone keep wearing masks, says time end mandate? Simply makes sense. sentences casual, since reddit.

Fair enough. Looks like babies might protected well young children. Christian Drosten said week topic, he's recently done study T-cell cross nest protection SARS-2 newborns. even another interesting observation children. children, especially young children, very, mild, almost always asymptomatic courses SARS-2, newborns apparently well protected SARS-2 infection. nest protection kinds infectious diseases, comes via antibodies mother, via placenta also little bit via breast milk, way, newborns protected many infectious diseases first year life, observation newborn children well protected SARS-2. first year life, much better. That's sudden, courses start asymptomatic. pattern, contamination coronaviruses, small children first year life get coronavirus infections. that, they're protected. maybe that's build cross-protective T-cell response. may so, none proven now. interesting lines research go after. think that's important know now, maybe reason good situation younger ones. perhaps old disease profile SARS-2 explained fact cross-reactive cells. situation comparable state knowledge, example influenza.

How? read original comment replying to, mentioned “refusing Indian ships dock ports”, “stop Indian flights landing countries”. suggesting cut rest world. That’s basically stoping exports. vaccines drugs Indian Pharma industry produces low price. Drugs poor countries Africa South America depend on. Yes agree leisure travel stopped. Indians going around touring world right now. aware. Unlike American, Indians need “tourist visa” go countries world. issued country right now. 

I get want end. too. everything black white saying “cut people world”. much frustrates Indian government allowed exports 64 million doses vaccines shortage India, still think would cruel heartless simply refuse vaccines countries really really need them. venue communicated us said they're due Milwaukee County guidelines/restrictions currently. Pfizer\* Less 10% invested. fuck trying argue?? correct number number cases fully vaccinated people (5800 cases 66M vaccinated), it’s *quite* calculate vaccine effectiveness.

To that, would need compare cases vaccinated people number cases similar population unvaccinated people. 

I don’t numbers, BUT, know **5 million confirmed cases among ~264M unvaccinated population** since Feb 1, “full vaccinations” basically started.

So 5M cases 264M unvaccinated = **1.89% unvaccinated people caught it.**

During time frame,

5800 cases 66M fully vaccinated= **.008% vaccinated people caught it.**

Which would mean vaccine showing **99.6% effectiveness**

**MAJOR DISCLAIMER** 

There many differences vaccinated/unvaccinated populations, time-related differences (unvaccinated unvaccinated whole time, number vaccinated increasing time; also risk infection decreasing people vaccinated), etc. calculation mostly kicks giggles. 

We still assume vaccines effectiveness still 90%–95% range found clinical trials. Ahhhh okay. they’re similar, see blood clots AstraZeneca Pfizer? We're going start seeing ""Experts willing bet kid life savings mRNA super awesome everyone, could mean 0.0000001% chance dying, Crazy revelation CLICK HEREE!""

There really something wrong news websites days. People household don’t always catch covid either wasted vaccination. Wasted health become severe covid work. Give two shots biontech everything fine. flinched McLaren employee (maybe mechanic?) actually tested positive pretty much forced McLaren pull out. Lewis pretty openly saying absolutely attempting put grand prix money reason happening. ""when"" questions might still unanswerable...

* J&amp;J resumed US? concerned people die pause.
* downgraded endemic? forgot metrics are. Perhaps would official ""end"" (if thing) COVID ways... Sure hindsight given know outdoor transmission lot wasn’t known time things closed. think areas kept restrictions long also think it’s easy say king thing hindsight. least county 10 days last person testing positive. provide actual substance fear-mongering bullshit? think autoimmune response - immune system getting confused going overdrive. far I'm aware, sort thing usually triggered first weeks, body responding vaccine's signal produce antibodies. example, mum kidney infection triggered autoimmune low platelet condition withina couple weeks. zombie apocalypse needs hurry get here/s could killed thing 3 months.

This contagious. never realistic chance kill without effective vaccine. Caught covid November constantly wearing mask(cashier sneezed mask nose, health department said likely caught eyes). Spent 8 days ICU, suffered long term effects. I'm vaccinated ya know what, longer gonna wear mask I'm out. Excellent news. make Moderna shortfall, though timing quite line up. Thank you. Nothing said remotely resembles *epidemiology* experts saying. Whether repeating lies others said deliberately unintentionally, regurgitating pro-corporate propaganda. tell magic method perfectly identifying asymptomatic “sick people”? could win Nobel prize immediately stop transmission people followed special method.


Or maybe luck. You’re correct Pfizer (and moderna same), AZ J&amp;J also similar. use live virus, virus causes covid-19. use harmless adenovirus delivers instructions cells make spike protein. idea similar mRNA vaccines; difference using adenovirus infect cells deliver instructions vs using lipid “envelope” get instructions cells.

I’m really struggling find info situation online. much fines per each? point agree. Online able connect peers professors well in-person difficult. ultimately, attend university degree move employment. university supposed pause pandemic digital technology allows function (albeit, shittier lol)?

I think individuals perceiving drop return investment. College prices already significantly students believe receiving subpar education compared previous semesters. think degrees really matter learn employment. However, specific career tracks like medical, would definitely need in-person IMO. think really depends people going much willing pay different learning experience. It’s useful show people aren’t vaccinated obvious benefits getting vaccinated I've made 10 trips back forth year. one call quarantine trips.  asked was, ""Are following quarantine rules?"" syphilis...  Sorry, clearer, everything seen says highly unlikely would cause issues months let alone years line, really concern within weeks. understand coming from, bit nuanced here. flu prevalant after-effect people's long term health covid (edit: I'm talking long covid heart rate, blood clotting, neurological issues, etc), spread quickly far. Flu easily avoided within home avoid sick person clean surfaces. (I've never caught people house I'm careful). Covid spread ventilation system (thus wear masks, easy precaution).

Now, got covid control vaccines like things immuno compromised people easily able avoid rest us vaccinated (measles, smallpox, etc), bam! Easy! There's much risk go daily worry kinda thing even get sick easily! bad, I'm used arguing people believe otherwise want mandates based fact.

Even so, public masking useful--until certain level vaccinations reached--because can't tell who's vaccinated they're wearing mask. know Canada, lot bad actors US understand masks affect COVID transmission think masking tool control/punish specifically. Good hear, thanks! isn’t really true. lot sports athletes really small competitive window. 

With olympics prime competition many track field sports - may last time athletes solidify ability make money sport. 

I get somethings less important life isn’t fair. definitely empathize athletes affected. It’s different people livelihoods jeopardized pandemic. 

The majority athletes currently make little money even paying way olympics minimal national support. current situation Brazil absolutely concerning watch closely. 307 people 0-18 age group died Covid USA since pandemic started. 

If happening Brazil starts happening agree react appropriately safety measures protect kids. right rate bad outcomes justify continued restrictions get enough adults vaccinated. I'm Covid skeptic anti-masker clarify, live one hardest hit parts country. point go back normal literally go forever. signed 19 month old called yet. Anything get baby (and others' babies) protected asap. don’t know price, technology produce certainly lot easier handle, meaning developing countries produce locally. Indian let say situation fucked. 
Politicians blatantly holding election rallies spiritual gatherings. Hmm, checked painkillers took side effects kicking butt acetaminophen plus aspirin. Oh well, I'm gonna assume things fine considering trials block folks taking pills side effects efficacy still fine. Thanks spelling out! think many people continue confuse effectiveness efficacy, thinking thing. Yeah anti-vax/covid denying people know age range I’m surprised guess that’s anecdotal experience. sincerely hope get close match UK number, would amazing! According CDC, no, long he's showing symptoms. Me.

I'm gonna ps5 rtx 3080 Ebola different case. spreads symptomatically, symptoms quite obvious.

People countries still let in, still get leaked cases them. US bar US citizens, example, coming back. I’m happy end soon, mental health going fucking shot things finally open up. Haha US able follow path Israel, seems likely. 10,000 cases day US equivalent 270 cases day Israel. Israel's current 7 day average 202. solar powered flashlights too! logic guess wear masks forever. That's said adults vaccinated That’s thinking...unfortunately Dr work/Dr say assume actually positive. likely get false negative false positive. Luck science wouldn’t say drastically people anti-vax, rather libertarian streak “don’t tell get vaccinated government, I’ll damn time.”

I’d worried age group’s apathy getting vaccine anytime soon schools expensive financial aid pretty good. Tuition college close $80k/year come close paying even half someone normal middle class family, I'll able graduate debt-free fortunately hope so. Interested see works second end guy parents mid August. area it’s open anyone 16 chance point Still better I've seen little plexiglass shields mouth mask, one clerk dollar store that. big peice plexiglass either, like 4 square inches so, maybe more, ridiculous working near worthless protection. sucks. Everyone 16+ approved vaccine WA state probably long states. He’s wrong graduate school would deferred (speech pathology). quality absolute shit many current students person practicums intended provide hands experience vital becoming full fledged speech pathologist. Tuition reduced compensate. sir way boyfriend fully vaccinated also fully vaccinated. boyfriend lives home brother tested positive today (4/16). saw boyfriend (4/13). boyfriend need quarantine even though he’s fully vaccinated? Polish women may hottest white girls Earth. Theyve got Slavic jaw often blonde hair. Someone tell MIL who's fully vaccinated best friends they've covid already thinks fine hang indoors unmasked. Yes. mid May start seeing cases plummet. Israel shows us hit 50% population vaccinated, cases drop dramatically. is, Israel averages 200 cases day, would 7200 US. end month somewhere mid 40s one shot total population.

The cases go we’ve made latest surge cases. Cause it’s easy look antibody-dependent enhancement immunity (ADE)for it’s actual concern emerging variants. Previously developed antibodies could aid wild virus becoming dangerous causing damage. We’re monitoring closely potential, time tell. dunno Americans ever get debt prices. can't even remember much tuition costs me, factor. definitely pay 65k total Also study saying there's 2 cases \~500k ... 180 million vaccinations united states there's 3....

the study likely using weird sampling.... also done bunch psychiatrists... please provide better context/information. think public gonna play along masks anymore June. Honestly, adult US vaccinated July, that's UK's managed get 95% 55s far. wonder US able reach numbers. I've heard bit antivax though. Thanks!

I realized commented here. Chile lot newer COVID variants? E.g., variant that's wreaking havoc Brazil?

It would interesting know well different vaccines work newer variants real world. pandemics (think Ebola) time. much easier think longer allow flights specific nations. go kids get vaccinated

Honestly welcome keep masking distancing fall wish.

Assuming schedule revised end May vaccine available demand anyone 16 wants it. Add another 6-8 weeks account stragglers getting full efficacy early-mid July. point I'm going back (full-stop, 2019) normal unless kids actually dying alarming rate. happened re-evaluate consider rather I'll choose continue wearing masks public little longer. state tries prolong beyond I'll pay fine masking (which, know anyone ever actually fined honest).

I still believe sometime next couple months cases fall low levels. 

Look Israel. Yes smart, I'm gonna meet friends inside house instead outside. Makes sense disputed anything said counterarguments. People reasons concerned new technology emergency use now. keep pushing popular narrative blindly trust reason. Think brainwashed here. I’m trying explain concerns people like have, concerns swept rug, we’ll come demand answers. dismiss anything say, that’s unlikely make anyone else change mind. tragic. intentional choice people US made making. disingenuous present is. JnJ makes Moderna shortfall extent week. We'll still 250k vaccines short nationwide April. Pfizer's boost huge. Knowing almost certainly delivered time.

Good That’s true. Though case reacted Pfizer way home. might waited longer didn’t want exposure someone harassing customers. BBC whole thing sounds like BS. It’s antibodies. Kids simple immune system. It’s off. aggressive response infections seems stop covid getting foothold. Got first today - excited never wash hands again! Same! went away 30 hours. July don’t wanna hearing word “wave” “surge” “spike” again, it’s longer issue wear mask stores (which I’m vaccinated) I’m gonna wear one ever again. people fuck that, I’m gonna remind bullshit afterwards.  could thrown heavy money resources domestically fully invoking Defence Production Act. 3M still produces domestically.

Looks like we’ve also officially crossed 80% 65+ year olds getting least one dose 64.6% fully vaccinated.   Today. It’s 10 days dad’s positive result, unless symptoms. Without making value judgement content message, no, that's talking about.

I fully vaccinated. longer act like thing. going back living. Lockdowns happened U.S. forever now. one hard locking except last Spring. worst possible time...at last minute govt spent maximum amount money athletes arrived great expense. Spoiler I’m originally Michigan access things like newspapers state. don’t special information. 

People participating activities younger healthier - groups affected adversely virus. states health department website also indicates hospitalizations continue way down. grave risk? people allowed get sick anymore? Well leader like Trump he’s sent lord policies rapture babies back god it’s part god’s plan. /s pretty much every single person picture used overweight. Asians also much higher risk Diabetes, even without overweight. They're playing lives. tested February 2020? sick March 2020 told way get test basically hospitalized point never got tested.

The trials practically can't big. 

That said efficacy, plenty large enough. Problem government objection handing nice pricey fine try go them, possible jail time

Heck, fly area (where everyone wants one vaccinated) land required isolate 10 days take 2 tests costing £210 per person

To drag easy money point vaccinated nothing changes!? It’s called opinion bud. Specialization expertise doesn’t free decisions criticism guarantee ultimately made right moves. 

Never said thought smarter anyone. Might want dive bit deeper correlation analysis. said another thread, I’d like repeat here. New Hampshire Texas Florida, cities towns free continue mask mandate without state interference. Nashua (2nd largest city) mask mandate state probably (just one example). There’s real world data mixing Pfizer j&amp;j keen that?  arm hurt lot worse first dose second. Doubtful. Pausing J&amp;J done similar damage pausing AZ. AZ largely dropped option Europe. I'm onboard lot precautions, curfews bullshit obvious reasons, first fucking foremost, night already fewest amount about, restricting people hours seem like would effective reducing spread.

Second, forces grocery shop/etc curfew hours crowd normal hours increase density.

Third, clubs gatherings, address directly. real world data? also said it’s extremely safe too, months, told us get first one get. info changed. real world data J&amp;J info efficacy going change too? Yeah got first dose Pfizer today thing I'm feeling right sore arm. similar overused muscle quite pulled. Annoying inconvenient, nothing severe. know sell warm winter face coverings?

Stopping J&amp;J vaccine cause extra covid deaths, seem care aspect health safety. EU thank UK investing Halix factory supplying key ingredients Pfizer production. incidents question rare significant enough indicate J&amp;J bad. still going provide immunity need. pause physicians create plan action better manage rare condition occurs. buy negative messaging. no, layer vaccines. likelihood causing dangerous side effects greater possibly experiencing clotting issues. So...I'm Florida. lot outdoor vaccine events. risky? suppose cooler ice would keep bottle temperature range...maybe? mean kill people question remaining is, top post? vaccine fine. 

There indication efficacy question. 

They extremely adverse certain types risk. MI least hospitals starting become overwhelmed, becoming problematic. there's political point anymore regardless politics (it matter are, I'd wager vast majority young people going clubs, bars, etc. politically active voting, ones driving pandemic point) Americans soft can't bothered restrictions.

My biggest complaint Merkel's proposal actually address real problems: home office schools. home office mandatory kids back schools. evidence I've seen shows two big drivers new infections law fails address them. night curfew proposal dumb saw research would change things % properly enforced (which impossible) peanuts compared making mandatory home office / closing schools. event insurance. pays two billion hold it... think probably occur. 100%. 2 weeks comes Wednesday.

Hoping get done late May early June send Liability I'm considering that, justice side evenly matched ""just try somewhere else draw attention yourself"" side. one hand, long take go versus other. want get shot I'm risk. suspected reasons lack internet/computer access, transportation/logistics issues, hesitancy.

It’s actually gotten point pulling census records residents 65 knocking doors get signed transportation provided. main virologist took (our PM 40s, he'll wait). probably read article see CEO actually said... Hell yes doses already shipped Mexico Canada. contracts USA forbid us re-selling them, positioned ""borrowing"" shots.

Insanity. kidding there’s 50,000 appointments What’s happening Israel seems go entirely saying. evidence lower side effects Pfizer, yes essentially same. 

At point probably find Pfizer somewhere, honest may easier convincing him. problem many people read headlines, stop there. nothing hand offer know never instance vaccine causing side effects beyond months already 9-10mos post vaccination earliest trial participants. may good info use search comparison bit apples oranges though? compares annual rate 1 month rate groups looks completely overlapping. even says natural rate children old people vaccine data excludes children incidence old people.

It may come lookout truly background noise, enough evidence AZ suggest happen higher population rate least subgroups.

Its also rather suspicious since similar effect side effects cases COVID, reasonable conclude possible interaction somehow relates specific vaccine since targets part COVID also interacts blood related stuff. think main thing sentiment kind devalues people genuinely want socialize . fine don't, I'd consider lucky enjoy time alone times. people want make friends able socialize outside school time that's also valid.

my experience Germans anything but. I've never seen group people ruthless get plane Germans, people casually disregard airport security (literally walking around metal detectors) Berliners. 

A healthy antibody authoritarian past think. don’t need insurance get shot. someone telling do, call local health department vaccination site breaking rules. think it'll states cities mandates, it'll businesses requiring deal outrage kind people want everyone wearing masks zero new infections.

Happy wrong, obviously. Apple store index CDC numbers fully vaccinated slightly misleading, numbers give ""fully vaccinated"" counting people second get second dose (or 1 dose J&amp;J) , ""fully vaccinated"" commonly discussed. thing goes show limitation profit media industry add riddled society. goal organizations get click article stories much like doom stories get clicks. article says 100 people got sick despite vaccinated third line article something like x scientist says way would expect proof vaccines working well people never actually read article past first couple sentences. responsible editors would something like vaccines highly effective sometimes breakthrough cases article would break numbers further.  seems different headline...

For first time ever history journalism. true. Germany state law, meaning rules apply everyone regardless Chancellor janitor. course rights state officials others have, laws passed parliament voted people. Sometimes take risks. Given circumstances think made right decision. God dammit philly Especially given age, doubt anything happen. her, risk catching covid dying covid much higher for, say, woman 20s leaves house get groceries (yes, that's me, lol). Yes 🤣 yup. masks Publix masked servers restaurants would easy forget there's pandemic. Honestly felt way since last summer though. know competition, that's comment about.

And clearly understand fully protected precisely comment talking about. 2 weeks 1st shot pfizer/moderna efficacy 80%. 2 weeks J+J efficacy 66%. Yet people J+J considered fully vaxed fully protected, moderna pfizer isn't. make sense. 

This mean I'm advocating skipping 2nd dose, I'm going mine next week. I'm saying way data presented comment responded better represents actual ""level immunity"" know anything that. sure long sentence though lot words.  could buy 20 3M N95 Masks (NIOSH-certified, imitation N95s) Amazon $14 pandemic. parent right manufacturing things prioritized could ended pandemic long time ago. That’s awful, I’m Montgomery county 65+ number like 83%. bad city? probably lot hesitancy around AZ age group that's supposed still get AZ. Makes lot sense me. good, single day making significant difference. Pfizer always top called free media.  whole saga vaccines legitimately one greatest accomplishments medical history. Prior this, quickest ever developed vaccine 4 years mumps. shit development January 2020 far understand approved 12 months. Getting made rolled quickly seriously remarkable, never expected successful. Arizona live, certainly feels like might herd immunity despite ""only"" 36% people vaccinated first dose. opened everything several weeks ago, ~3 weeks ago governor came directly voided mask mandates multiple times make sure. go gym, looks feels like 2019. 

For couple weeks, metrics increasing, rapidly. Cases kind lazily rising, hospitalizations deaths stopped falling went tiny amount. metrics moving downward again. 7 day average cases, ER visits, deaths actually lower last Friday. I'm sure explain herd immunity. metrics exploding. mean Sweden suddenly realised effed begged people responsible? still better options here.

Demand still outstripping supply many parts US. Putting breaks J&amp;J means many people get vaccinated later would have.

It's also important consider people, J&amp;J option. really. Mostly States started 75 older critical health care workers expanded there. supply could open categories sooner Disagreed, least half people Germany unhappy overused phrase ""nExT 2 wEeKs cRitIcAl"" (especially younger people, mental health toll real, many articles it). officially considered ""2 weeks"" ""fully vaccinated""?

E.g. received second dose Friday April 2, would ""officially"" fully vaccinated today Friday April 16? tomorrow? think essential workers likely POC thus likelihood maintaining jobs. big box stores remained open, construction projects remained open... effected probably restaurants maybe small business type, travel related jobs. worth died would affected lot things. can't quite imagine would happened Covid response died back exposed. definitely get tested. helps data collection. knowing certain may change behaviors bit. Go government site. asked insurance card gave shot. Hessen RLP, 60-69 year olds prio 3 able get vaccine astra stockpile. surprised too. 79 year old father still doesn’t one. chancellor English. Chancellorette sounds like little girl playacting. English gender job titles (usually). Gus Fring line Breaking Bad I've used couple times, actual quote, doubt try say paraphrase bit message clear. 

And man, man provides. even he's appreciated, respected, even loved. simply bears it. he's man. (my add here) provide safety family community getting vaccinated I'm man. really doesn't. provide alternate vaccine under-30's rule AZ together nothing less stupidity. Things change quite bit summer. feeling reach good point like late summer people want vaccinated vaccinated, we’ll enter realm life like living flu. Wasn’t much urgency people get shot. You’d see recommendations get flashing electronic boards Walgreens CVS probably doctor. really interested see case keep staying grey area state another year so.

Stuff keeps trying open Wednesday morning probably 1000 people getting first second Pfizer shots felt like first outing months. long line coordinated moved fast felt like lines old get places, making giddy future short time get second shot. people different parts line friends surprised see other. Everyone nervous yet satisfied look face shit finally over. seeing people front behind reassured public actually getting it. also reassured people could state trying get vaccines mine struggle first places 3+ hours away simple 30 minutes even less closer. 

Felt like watching part one big historical moments people read text books 50+ years now. went worst possible way handle pandemic something back normal. True, vaccine others previous President, I’m sure future planning, shots, better responses pandemics general better, maybe we’ve seen true power governors rather President. feel people luxury able “anti-Covid restrictions” similar ways flu, anything that’s deadlier that’s basically full nightmare deadly Ebola contagious Covid definitely keep people indoors. again, knows. unvaccinated 50% staying bubble you, either. travel. cross state lines, interact unvaccinated people.

No children 16 vaccinated yet. Again, think probable. fully expect vaccinations things return mostly normal sometime summer US good chance wide spread restrictions go back next pandemic. effective reducing severity length flu. proven fact feel damn lucky happened became parent think wasn’t terrible advice early vaccination part pandemic. “We’re totally yet, careful”. general population vaccinated, it’s leading lot people going, “what’s point?” Even though would personally prevent infection. thought Canada stronger border/inbound flight controls place?

I wonder variants got state. dad quit smoking 70's saw blood oxygen level rise course day inpatient care. finally hit bad (after several near fatal heart issues) pretty graph anything much think about.  


I've idea point story. One six million die blood clot -- OMG risky.

vs

1706 million die COVID -- Yeah, worries. unlikely die COVID

-- --

We idea long term effects vaccine designed specifically safe be

vs

We idea long term effects getting Covid, virus whose purpose survive killing crippling host concern all. 

People suck assessing risk rationally. Basically Africa South America travel ban list due P1 B1351 strains. talking about... mother hesitant getting vaccine says tested long term effects 16 year old like start hate her. never lock down, private lock down.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* concern they're closing earlier expected based inadequate demand higher.

I'd concern people still driving hour get shots.

Personally, 3 places within 2 blocks house giving shots - I'm still driving hour get shot Walmart weekend. I'd still rather go mass vaccination site. countries fewer new cases covid make sense use AZ vaccine rather wait vaccines relatively safer. saying significant percentage vaxxed people still get infected transmit disease reduced symptoms risk serious illness. understanding worked, thread seems saying vaccines actually confer almost total immunity. think journalists utter crap explaining science, don’t know science statistics themselves, usually.

What scientists actually said didn’t data see infections truly curbed vaccine. many months ago though, rapidly changed.

Most research point shows pretty robust effect vaccine stopping infection, well spreading it.

As “full immunity”, that’s really thing. vaccine isn’t magical shield virus particles, pretty effective (from I’ve seen study Israel, 90%+ effective) preventing infection.

However effects vaccine masks stack. you’re unlikely get disease vaccinated, you’re even unlikely get disease wearing mask vaccinated. goal either prevent infection robustly can, slow spread COVID personally can, wearing masks even vaccinated good step direction.

Everything statistical disease, chances infection seem very, low. Move olympics Miami? sub turing science faster anti-mask/anti-vax crowd 12. son 15 months kids (3 them) 10. would banning equal basis, 100% acceptable. However, stage, SA red list, cases B1.351 automatically attributed SA restricted highest level months. variant circulating widely amongst countries considered “high-risk” - would rather strange attribute SA situations. 

The inconsistency bit mind-boggling. It’s fine SA stays red list - reasons - starts look less kosher nobody else added every case B1.351 attributed South Africa despite wide global circulation. Yes risks also uniform across population, something find frustrating get attention. Younger healthy people far, far less risk serious illness death covid risk equation different. Like 18 year old woman got blood clot J&amp;J vaccine probably exchanged one one-in-a-million risk another. polls steadily moving, cynicism unwarranted. One worst hit regions world, also completely dropped ball vaccine rollout. Seems like fucked me. EU Redditors, mocked US year Trump, USA, lack healthcare, look whole. excuse now?

Not looking political answer, understand better without Trump example. both. Pfizer last read around 91% prevention rate catching covid catch it, Moderna 99% chance keeping developing severe hospital level complications. still wear mask fully vaccinated. month. two friend fully vaccinated traveling wearing masks gatherings gotten covid yet. 

[Pfizer press release vaccine. would hope June changes 6 months data sample size large enough prove lack transmission. believe two main factors.

1: Restrictions considered national/wide area, means enough one place good. Fairness may also play role, making sure similar restrictions avoid people jumping fences spite personal principle.

2: Ending restrictions mean spike covid cases. countries well restrictions long time (e.g. Norway) keep KEEP good. done last two weeks terms risk? Eating restaurants indoors? I'm India. stop ""holier tho"" tone. hope feel great telling daily fear living here. Wait...An anti vaxxer believing science data? Dodging measly flu virus. Nice. - ‘how 58-90% vary differently headline number effectively tiny rounding error away 100%’

I’m definitely anti-vaxxer means. trying understand two sets numbers coexist true? J&amp;J supposedly 66% efficacy trials, 100% successful preventing hospitalization death.

That's... ""almost all"" stretch. I'm trying learn, dick COVIDIOTs going kill us all, keep virus alive, let create new deadlier strains keep living 18sqm prison ever! Yet another argument keep lockdown place indefinitely. relaxation mistake. 3 co-workers borderline antivax conspiracy theorists 3 months ago since gotten vaccine. people continue get shot people initially apprehensive decide get it. ...don’t need know rate infection unvaccinated population timeframe (presumably months)?

Yes, seem article. agree likely relatively high, would nice know high. Exactly. Phizer knows pocket aces we’re pre-flop here. old kids? 12+ year olds able get Pfizer vaccine couple months. /r/theydidnotdothemath got first moderna Tuesday, also 28m, felt like buddy punched arm day, got this! say? Air? respiratory disease? It’s gonna take minute wrap mind around this.... world really cannot deal another variant juncture vaccine programs started. Come guys. We’ve past months aikido dojo. (Along continued masking, reduced contact practice.) basically force air practice space fans, make sure CO2 levels remain low sensor. far haven’t virus transmission. know got it, since happens right after, us wait little getting shot nurses watched us see allergic reactions. 

That's lot different something happen home weeks later, seems happens AZ J&amp;J. Population density incredibly lucky make safety precautions unnnecessary.

Shrapnel almost never hits eyes, wear safety glasses machine shop. thought huge soft drink fan. Yes someone (rightfully) criticizes EU, deflect criticizing US?

No, deflect, argued ""EU members"" fuck up, least argument make sense is. vaccine stop viruses entering system. stop replicating point sickness contagion time. J&amp;J seems like perfect candidate moving production facilities India. Single shot delivery would ideal population dense large India’s No, think biology covid distinct influenza. I'm aware long haulers flu, year long brain fog. Certainly never see ground glass lung flu qua flu.

It may well relate coagulation defects covid induces causing microvascular damage. Covid closer severity measles flu upper respiratory tract infecting viruses. outbreak measles 1994 closed college 2 days. definitely worth it. People underestimate getting COVID vaccine site. Lots places social distancing enforced sometimes indoors ventilation sucks.  Pay wall Antibody response stronger two dose mRNA vaccine, actual illness. par getting single shot, 80% protective illness based antibody levels. seem person understands level protection potential benefits vaccination. office mandatory

Because ""economy"" sacred. many business associations behave like Karens ""our"" government listening them. point, honestly, probably nothing personal safety. data continue improve vaccinated. determine efficacy, probably want vaccinated group taking significantly exposure risks unvaccinated. also want social norms preventing spread diluted majority vaccinated. Go meet God (or Gods) guess.. Lunacy    hate living Netherlands  mean healthcare decent think, terms care. However cost third world shit. Makes sense. Yeah always skeptical immunity even variants would go away short period time. thought years note original SARS virus promising. Take total cases since vaccines began. Divide .7-.8 since roughly 30% COVID cases completely asymptomatic may show data. Subtract 5800 breakthrough infections. 

Now you’ll find average total population vaccinated per day time frame. 

Divide top calculation number. someone (rightfully) criticizes EU, deflect criticizing US? interesting. essentially vaccinated all. comparing Moderna Pfizer AZ J&amp;J. Also looking covid CVT risks within demographic AZ/J&amp;J effecting general population demographics? shouldn’t hard, however Poles stubborn lot, hate people telling even go far unhealthy thing means following guidelines. lived 20 years seen many times, nothing like pandemic. people refuse simple basic things show care community fellow man make sick. Even year still anti masker idiots running around, worst anti Vader’s numbers increasing. know previous CDC study Pfizer vaccine 90% effective preventing detectable COVID infections 2 weeks second dose. includes asymptomatic infections. literally said it’s almost all, 100%. small number still get infected it’s reallllllly small number (see .0008% above)

Read much brah? way? someone living france, covid manager horrible, like perpetual half lockdown, kids contaminated schools, super slow vaccination ""buggy"" reports numbers Covid still 3rd leading cause death US. move forward enough people aren’t dying everyday. depend vaccine uptake.

The vaccine helps 2 ways, first helps prevent individuals catching dying. Second lowers transmission among rest population virus less vectors spread. return normal spread low, reasonably sure future outbreaks won’t nation sweeping level events.

We’re still stage community spread high. Governments responsibility citizens, Covid still killing many people everyday, would irresponsible lift mask mandates even vaccinated people don’t want wear anymore.

What need try push people get vaccinated. Maybe offer incentives to. probably don’t really know themselves. lot unknowns atm. Vaccines work. Social distancing irrelevant vaccinated people. don’t know. think patents need look themselves. It’s alright volunteering something putting child forward choice. Well, hope live theselves. hope attention crave worth it. tried world court, causing massive spread mutations virus. affecting many countries. Along Amazon, open shut case. took Vitamin morning going heavy water appointment today 12:15. See goes lol godmother who’s mothers best friend wanted wait vaccine fear it’s safe. son got covid, bad case, talked doctor personal risk someone 60. got soonest appointment could get vaccinated Monday AZ. people need time they‘ll get eventually! enough us are*

Unless you’re speaking yourself. confirmed getting vaccinated reduces chances experiencing COVID symptoms well potential severity symptoms (vaccinated people nearly zero hospitalizations fatalities), yet confirmed vaccination prevent getting COVID entirely. possible may infected, affected, case still infect others. people infect vaccinated, they're risk severe symptoms. Reminder wearing mask protect much protects others you. since asymptomatic people tend spread COVID-19, cares missed asymptomatic cases? I'm vaccinated I'm never getting tested unless I'm symptomatic required international travel. case vaccines like Astra Zenca ? Yup. sure. Like said first, think risk blown proportion CDC careful ironically cause death suffering. Seriously... amount “stating obvious” main stream media lately ridiculous. Especially latest national security report CNN stating “might supply chain issues” coming months. People living supply issues 15 months now. People know. feels like directly contradicting posts thread... 2021 literally race get parents vaccinated watch clip Tucker Carlson talk ""smart friend"" work There's multiple studies show significant reduction transmission vaccinated. 100%. 

This article month old links many different No, support healthy balance caring people's health lives letting human activities go normal. US absolutely far that. ""Saving much lives possible"" mean getting zero deaths, possible get zero deaths. Read headline thought ""what sort restrictions us ford motor company doing? Mask required car start?"" talkin crusty age Epic reddit moment responsible leadership megacorporate citizenry like fathers intended pretending something didn’t happen? Thinking this, think could kept lot economy open prevented majority illnesses deaths. definitely right stayed down. would re-emergences, maybe would regional lockdowns mask-ups individual cities weeks instead interminably. strange request. Asking competitor validate product trouble ... JJ pro bono? make billions pharmaceutical products incl covid vaccines bought us fed money. depends data getting back real world. shows delaying 2nd doses gives robust response dont see would give early even supply.

It's looking like ontario get almost 1st doses finished canada day keep going current rate. speeding rate giving doses great sign things come. 

We need get VOC hump right now. numbers scary right now. like put mask, fucking stretch, watch movie two help poor granny next you. disagree studies, that's prerogative.

If read comment you’ll note never said disagree them.

What say amount math take three studies 1 10,000 (or odds matter). sure thing ever bet life! AZ J&amp;J vaccine available would gladly take get whole family well. citation hospital infections traced lunch rooms? 4 million doses.

Last week, US stockpile 20 million AZ doses.

If Biden administration wants retain token 1 million doses await FDA approval show confidence vaccine, say anything, issue US health, safety, national security rest world inoculated, residents US. started restaurants I'm vaccinated crowds blowing mind! crazy there. rare cerebral blood clots combination low platelets seen following vaccination vector DNA vaccines certainly line one would expect without vaccination. Intersting..I would think high rates dengue South America could potentially exacerbating mobility mortality many existing vaccines given ""mixed"" - reason state: 

The logic used spacing dosing vaccines beyond something small 3 weeks; that's many, many existing vaccines work. stop mass-condemnation UK everybody calling ""reckless gambling"" started longer dosing regime. Scholz, Steinmeier, Merkel took AZ. 
Only Seehofer thought something better, declined AZ got Biontech now.  Mine told us, least start! gotten everyone 30 masks month start, could killed thing 3 months.

If ""refusing wear mask"" become shibboleth indicating political tribe belong to. Dude, literally avatar wearing mask.

If true, basically means masks anything. China hardly needs vaccine doses developed far less efficacious ones. That's terrible argument. Got 2nd shot around 12:45pm yesterday. Woke around 5am cold sweats super achy legs, took painkillers - overnight rough. feel fine though (2pm), arm really even sore.

Do side effects come go? possible got lucky done them? That’s point headline doesn’t state. it’s true anyone IC’d.  Pfizer Moderna new variants wild tested, Brazil zoo variants aggressive less reactive antibodies original Wuhan strain. Moderna designed vaccine two days January 2020 definitely possibility future keep production line built place. That’s odd. link directly national news reporting. It’s going hard break habit washing hands 30 times day pre-covid 25 times day always get second shot champ. simple fact don’t know whether protection lasts 6 months, year more! Including me! Fully vaccinated!! Yay!!!! love going work hearing HR person saying someone recently vaccinated “it’s like another flu shot, don’t wanna tell that”

? It’s different virus? comparison here? might want get yearly ? 

What “they” gain? Well, COVID icing cake. 

Wait. don’t think that’s right metaphor. 

Ah, screw it. everyone likes cake. Flu basically stomped flat. Last week, [only 15 people tested positive flu entire United Yeah, going say thing.

If true, masks basically anything. certainly anything protect wearer. also recommend steaks well done  already said none county lmao Day 87 Biden Administration. I'm blood cancer survivor part study see produced antibodies following vaccination. There's signs even well past active treatment producing antibodies rate average population, even without immune issues, even cancer survivors. Considering one prime treatments, ABVD, Hodgkin's causes heart lung damage, already risk increased death got Covid. know vaccines might provide us limited protection, desperately need studies. French testing 3rd injections see improves antibody production example. really, need rest population vaccinate protect us. largest mutations variants occurred cancer patients active treatment worry could part problem too. Mine sticker clinic administered dose. placed \*before\* actually got shot. Damn, I’m sorry. 30 hours long time. hope feel better soon, friend. ❤️ regular flu derail entire world's economy healthcare system. COVID likely become seasonal like flu, longer end normal life. I’m confused mixed messaging experts. 

If I’m fully vaccinated parents fully vaccinated (high risk). think it’s safe go summer? Bars, softball league, etc... barely left house past year due fear visit parents (usually week), might give covid kill them. 

I thought vaccine end game, sounds like they’re saying world still dangerous place. Yeah didn’t study come trials? seriously don’t understand anyone would child this. data clear...there essentially 0% mortality 0-19 age group. Ireland past, one person 0-24 died Covid. true, long make lot money. Work great job gives great health insurance one best health care systems fingertips. always, issue US unequal distribution resources. That's guess well. ""2 weeks final dose"" guidance applied three vaccines currently use US.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also guess Moderna level protection one week Pfizer. They're extremely similar, I'd surprised find major differences two. moment, no. mRNA vaccines easier produce lower marginal cost since mRNA lines built ground there's quite bit upfront cost. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

That's true: late 2020, hospitals figured protocols, in-hospital infections among health care workers basically close zero. in-hospital infections could traced break rooms, staff eating lunch together.

The trick *everyone* needs masked. One big Boston hospitals, Spring 2020, greatly reduced in-hospital infections required everyone coming facility masked. surgical masks; staff continued using high-filtration masks.

Of course, hospitals general public: there's higher level knowledge, practice, protocol enforceability. general public, moving away cloth masks high filtration masks (N95/KN95/KF94); available now. here, 2nd shot yesterday currently going 30 hours head ache , fatigue fever. fully expect stay least 2022.

Yeah BS statements like ""the best world"" got clairvoyant.  unexpectedly offered leftover Moderna shot expire yesterday, literally walking street. thought I'd waiting months, one 'right place right time' stories read about. 

I'm 99.9 percent sure stupid question I'm going ask anyway. Grapefruit grapefruit juice affect lots medications, making less effective leading side effects. There's way grapefruit could similar interaction COVID vaccine, correct? got middle grapefruit kick. 

Thanks!! hope hit 90%, tough goal think possible. certainly fascinating contrast.

The UK first dose 1st policy got lot criticism made sense given situation fully vindicated too.

The UK also running trials mix match vaccines different gaps 1st 2nd dose that's 2,000 people total. Denmark Germany unintentionally created huge trial.

I fully support mix matching criticism certainly seems less controversial they're remarkably similar policy decisions. pointing tail end graph believe. us case started level Europes exploding linked doctor disagrees her.

Yeah I’m calling bs study done AZ try make look bad. rate alarming, least tell us rate is. Absolute numbers rate. Yes, people brain clots COVID positive feel like that’s morally wrong manipulative? something side effects FDA deems unsafe enough stop completely, let’s stop it. Drug companies don’t give fuck, know now.

Many, many drugs greater 1/1,000,000 chance severe reactions. really don’t get mask problem. It’s hard stay home (except work - I’m teacher I’ve campus since August, students campus since mid fall). hard wear mask. I’m thrilled able go see friends seems like really small thing mask protect others. wear KN95 40+ hours week work doesn’t bother me. 

And I’m saying “the rest time.” I’m saying pandemic control. Right numbers climbing 47,000 Americans hospitalized covid, aren’t yet. tf paying 65k per semester Working helps immune system long-term, short-term. sleep might good idea skip today. honestly, neither there. going fine. Water also wet. That's uniformly applicable. mean apply Taiwan? Definitely US administered [\~200 million date. Sounds like resounding success me.

I'm getting second dose tomorrow, I'm young(ish) healthy. mRNA gotten media attention super high-tech option, people assume options like old reliable. That's math works.

If choose 68 (or number) deaths COVID 1 death vaccine, choose 68 COVID deaths every time. medical oath ""do harm"", ""do harm unless saves lives aggregate"". willing trade one life others. lived months California, tell guys lot dumb people there, really doesn’t compare. I’m fortunate enough Italian citizenship don’t live permanently anymore, feel cant move. Brazil shithole country Bolsonaro covid, getting really bad level shit. send results doctor advise you. Japan developed country, come vaccinating rate developed countries? 

What's explanation? Walgreens manager saying could hand 40 shots day. That’s almost nothing. Clearly mass vaccination end eventually country isn’t yet. lack demand obviously coming it’s distressing see play out. Near everything still booked solid. Way completely ignore fact tech going vaccine absolutely nothing things said. good trying change subject. last year half about, it. would drink  Yeah got relatively lucky, although spent months iron lung.

Sure, totally independent vaccine we'd expect see every vaccine.  AZ Europe, men affected too. predominance working-age women may healthcare workers vaccinated first.

If 6 6.7 million accurate JnJ US, adverse effect seems ten times rare AZ, different type adenovirus. different populations Europe, effect found 1/600 000 (UK) 1/30 000 (Norway) people vaccinated. again, blood clots take time appear, may yet cases US. hope one-per-million figure turns hold. mean green light JnJ. enough get vaccinated gives virus ability mutate possibly render vaccine useless.

How suppose we'd prevent society collapsing lockdown go decade more? calling like is. reasonable put covid fears onto school aged children shelter vaccinated. risk miniscule. Might well never let drive car it.

This pandemic made people insane. maybe listen propaganda deciding live life, k? Oh, bad- forgot hadn’t approved it- hadn’t heard took plans. Thanks update, stranger. 👍😊 India becoming worse, least Brazil second worse. Keep positive. I’ve got life live 


I’ve also gotten sick, all, zero sniffles except allergies sleeping window open

I husband. don’t need touch anyone else. Disengagement, leading slower vaccine rollout overall. Also fostering distrust regardless findings pause lifted.

Imagine there's punch bowl party, someone took temporarily away table told everyone suspected someone dropped rat turds it. returned table let everyone know, false alarm. Would less inclined drink it? Frankly, it’s none business.

Then stop broadcasting business everyone Reddit....geez plateau, looking like cases starting decline last days?  I’m Texas throwing vaccines away people aren’t getting fast enough. us vaccinated going life like normal. people getting sick droves antivaxers. Every day hear story someone who’s freedoms violated thought whole thing hoax getting severely sick.

I know guy who’s church like 3 people die claimed still weren’t sure Covid another 3-4 people died weeks getting sick one funerals. 

What saying is, it’s sad, it’s tragic, everywhere like Texas now, half filled antivaxers.. people making numbers self inflicted. 

They really need start reporting numbers broken people refused vaccines. would stark, people would realize got vaccine fine. 

Also echo saying. like 10 million people vaccinated people Texas alone. lockdown. People get now, either self isolate vaccine don’t care. hah bold assume shops open 8. *Cries bavarian* Pretty sure pharmaceutical companies afford settle suits. That'swhat do; make drugs
Pay lawsuits. Lobby government. Number super high.  % population currently sick higher before. still stuck lockdown Chicago cook lot appointments early next week right Beat it. Life get back normal \*some\* point. Mask wearing rest time simply sustainable. start reach higher levels vaccinations, immune suppressed people wear N95 KN95 protect go. I've pro restrictions throughout pandemic, I've stayed home wore KN95 public, end point. would certainly speed global production US relaxed raw material export bans they're strong position vaccine wise.

Currently raw materials manufacture AZ vaccine US still prioritised rest world even though they're unlikely ever use AZ.

So US sat mountain vaccines never use, also manufacturing vaccines put onto mountain faster country.

As soon US Defence production act ends going explosion vaccine availability globally. recommend folding power rack garage accommodate it. That's I've used last year. week deadlifted 530, safe say I'm still making progress. Okayeg eg? it? Why? 

If you’re calculating whether get vaccinated not, shouldn’t death rate versus risk complications factored decision? 910 people Australia died Covid, despite measures protect them. Lockdown can’t go forever. 

1 person died vaccine Australia. 

I’d take vaccine. opinion may vary, complication rate vaccine 1 100,000.

And that’s one several vaccines, one making headlines moment Pfizer Moderna versions haven’t seen issues knowledge.  Yeah. Super Bowl wave going happen week now. right, OP messing probability calculations make seem like point valid.  im pro-vax incredibly stupid logic. likely going get covid waiting get different type vaccine, there's much point risking it. F's chat teachers. Thanks sharing. vaccine 100% effective treating severe cases. Moderna’s trails found 0 severe cases among non placebo patients. You’ll fine. perfect conditions vaccines effective, would seen trial results wouldn’t even approved emergency use. They’re effective vaccines! Indian coworkers talk almost daily basis, they've practically amused they've gone back normal US. They've telling us parties weddings sending us pics insanely crowded shopping areas hardly mask sight. attitude recently pretty much covid gone away. Resistance Covid infection seems last 3 months, I've seen far. So, recommended people get vaccinated become susceptible again. I'm Texas lifted state restrictions month ago. Masks still enforced number businesses, I'm gradually seeing less less people wearing them.

It seems like places simply 'encouraging' masks days, rather enforcing them. also live part Texas relatively high amount people complying masks. I'm really thinking Memorial Day seeing many masks Texas. would rely whims overzealous local politicians ease restrictions timely enough fashion would allow normal wedding.

I'm optimistic normal summer reason. reach critical mass vaccinated people, yes keep restrictions place. loosening rules vaccinated people fine with; say “go back normal” reach herd immunity, we’re asking trouble. unfortunately need either reach immunity global scale far severe travel restrictions right now.  thing happened UK variant taking hold. nurse called radio show said pediatric wards filling terribly ill children. caused panic, turned take noticeable increase child hospitalization. complaint upheld broadcaster correcting information.

I'm sure nurse question saw something spooked her. Perhaps hospital hot spot area saw increase cases without change proportion age. true statistically. never said wouldn’t get vaccinated, definitely will...after lengthy period time given general public.

I’ve Corona, headache week Full reopening good point. point lockdowns stop hospitals overwhelmed, currently that's happening even without lockdowns. !!!!!! YAYYYYY add world ""leaders"" list, especially India's Modi. Conducting election rallies massive Hindu festive gathering 200,000 new cases reported daily crime humanity. catastrophe convinced species see dawn 22nd century. Pretty sure one IOC bigwigs said games postponed last year 2021, they'd happen next summer games would 2024 schedule.

I know people qualified Olympic Trials track even though they'd shot making actual roster, it'd suck much even able trials they're probably never going get chance again. Overall state dip flattened stopped, whilst may case counties, counties, rural seeing increases think soon start show trends coming weeks.  Kids need masks even vaccines. That's illegal, charging reported. Something right ""virus"" mutates fast needs vaccinations time leaving everyone fear. man made virus different properties virus animal? never locked down. That's exactly meant, although wording precise. assumes 345K number completely reported. use original official figure 800 assume everything reported number goes 0.2% I’ve seriously disappointed governors offic hasn’t sent weekly, daily reminders people minimize risk. Although get plenty emails governors office none minimize risks acquiring Covid. illusion wearing masks public fools people thinking safe cases Covid acquired home. People friends/relatives house think friend doesn’t symptoms they’re safe. isn’t rocket science sure seem act like Honestly it’s crap shoot wouldn’t read much it. Idk anyone gotten link central scheduling system. tell appointments staying open several hours days month ago appointments would probably open 5-15 mins depending site. Yep I’ve seen people wearing expensive hard find 3M N95’s noses, like even make sense waste good mask. Ironically, I’ve observed oldest, at-risk people usually worst offenders. Yeah, ""genocide"" thing hard evidence all, like WMDs Iraq. issue taking J&amp;J, can't blame younger people exposing bigger risk.

One issue society we're really bad discussing risks. Things either ""safe"" ""CAUSES RARE BLOOD CLOTS OMGWTFBBQ11!!!one!!eleven!1!!."" dust settles find incidence rate really one million across groups people still avoiding vaccine that, that's really unfortunate. blame people large, would blame news companies sensationalist headlines, public health authorities poor communication risk. Could private hospitals simply cutting corners exposing babies infection risk present elsewhere world? Might explain large number infected babies. Doesn’t North Dakota meat packaging facilities basically breeds covid lot concern keep seeing people say “when everyone wants vaccine get one,” ignoring fact excludes everyone age 12. time get ""5+""

Ignoring variant escape, would scale probability getting clot COVID herd immunity threshold (\~75-80%) account risk vs vaccine. got J&amp;J. screwed? Giving metrics sounds reasonable. Pretending it’s fine right not. Herd immunity wont reached 80% world's population vaccine. great x number millions vaccinated, actually need numbers billions.  kind feel that's given rather sort accomplishment/promise. government trying get people vaccinated since 2020. always assumed would continue regardless President. Lol, hope math teacher. Need advice.. wedding scheduled late July Milwaukee. Currently 80% guests vaccinated June it'll 99% guests. However, we're going make final ""move forward cancel/postpone"" call soon currently event restrictions tight. want wedding pre-packaged food people able mingle household members / strict social distancing also want cancel/postpone (again, original date 2020) could mostly normal wedding summer. know sub largely optimistic summer anyone insights thoughts restrictions lifting soon? third kid already technically inoculated.

you saved little bugger least one injection.

sore arm much bigger deal 3. Wearing mask along restrictions really getting old lot people, understand why.

I feel like takes away element human connection. miss walking bagel shop Saturday morning greeted smiling baker smiling back. Plus I'm bit hard hearing able see people's mouths they're talking tough me. 

I wore still wear mask every applicable situation year, even CDC recommended mandates. point want connection local community back, think widespread vaccine availability everyone wants shot get one, that's point draw line. really can't go forever. flu shot mean get attend concerts games. evidence currently predominantly childhood vaccines, parents would preemptively give child dose medication shots reduce side effects. evidence base yet covid vaccines. It’s unlikely that, without evidence, physician could recommend revaccination. 

This show infection (not vaccination) taking nsaids reduced antibody response. It’s unknown whether applies antibodies created vaccination. would disengagement blood clots cdc fda instead nothing?

Probably level disengagement we're seeing Moderna Pfizer, also cases blood clots trials. Every single vaccine far cases blood clots. every single instance, exceedingly rare. Thus putting pause vaccine 1-12 clots per several million doses administered probably wise goal cause people panic. Super unreasonable. a) choice; either allow live lives find someone else babysit. It’s going get much safer vaccines available children echo others already said certain point harm good come isolating children. Ultimately decision, something think about. I’m sure factors. one thing keep seeing Japan surprising amount vaccine hesitancy (I believe due problem vaccine past), took longer developed countries approve vaccine. it’s approved, convince people take too. 

And top that, believe they’re problem countries, actually procuring vaccine, global vaccine supply scarcity. Haven’t guys vaccinated 50% country now? Cause sane. That's increase suicides. That’s claimed zero evidence people trying return full normalcy immediately, numbers 2020 actually came recently, actually fact think it’s better keep high risk kids “isolated” rather low risk kids wear masks appalling. Masks big impact. person students bothered all. I’m much worried students risk factors remain isolated long term around refuse take minor precautions safety. still locked down. reopen borders find out.  would understand risk get informed consent vaccinated risk. That's math....

If 1000 people infected 10 die. 8 death unvaccinated. true get Covid, much likely get Covid bad reaction get vaccine :/ Thanks, website lot better one using. Booked slot mile away next week. No, that's it. 1 5 chances compared unvaccinated population. trialing mixing different vaccines we'll data eventually. Likely scenario matter problem mixing different kinds. need prove first. Mmmm chances pretty pretty good won’t actually Kids resilient adults. systems always relearning rebuilding. Unlike adults actually fragile. Kids bodies accept newer code adapt it. Boosters. Rather troubling. hard enough getting first two shots second one made ill two days. I'd really hate think going annual even bi-annual struggle. reporting across ages Brazil. total death toll 365K today likely much higher given excess deaths.

Even consider reporting children, would 2K/365K = 0.5% deaths. Children 9 correspond 12.5% country population.

I would assume higher developed countries due health care collapse still number children dying much less overall population.

Still large number though super sad. We're starting really scrape bottom doomsday barrel.

Perhaps importantly, even COVID clotting factor tiny fraction overall risk. two questions focusing are: 
1. rate blood clots vaccines high enough consider risk? \[Seems like answer yes certain groups, we're still collecting data\]

I actually agree this, Hamburg 9 pm curfew last two weeks, one two states seen 7-day incidence rate fall period, albeit marginally. caveat ""correlation imply causality"" applies, though. *The German chancellor always said would wait turn vaccinated. Jumping queue Germany serious business, threats prosecution don’t wait line.*

Unlike many world leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made much fuss fact vaccinated AstraZeneca vaccine, made British-Swedish manufacturer. 

The 66-year-old chancellor received vaccine specially installed center Berlin's former Tempelhof Airport, currently working exclusively AstraZeneca, vaccine available over-60s Germany, marginal risk blood clots. Around 3,000 people day currently receive vaccination there. 

The vaccination announced spokesman Steffen Seibert post Twitter, simple photo showing vaccination certificate.

Merkel said: ""I delighted received first vaccination today AstraZeneca. thank everyone involved vaccination campaign — everyone gets vaccinated. Vaccination key overcoming pandemic.""

Several times recent weeks, chancellor forced answer question would getting injected, whether would taking AstraZeneca. response always same: ""When turn, I'll get vaccinated, including AstraZeneca."" clearly knows sensitive issue vaccination queue is, especially Germany. 
Politicians Germany taken pains avoid coming across queue-jumpers, even there's reason allowed — case chancellor. 
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also avoided fanfare vaccinated beginning April military hospital Berlin: office merely issued photo press release, confirmed given AstraZeneca. 

""I trust vaccines approved Germany,"" 65-year-old Steinmeier quoted saying. ""Vaccination decisive step way pandemic. Take advantage opportunities, join in."" 

In Baden-Württemberg's 72-year-old Premier Winfried Kretschmann, Green Party, far one German politicians allowed TV cameras used vaccinated March. also received AstraZeneca vaccine hastened add confidence effectiveness.

Are risks? course. risk vaccinating higher, imho. don’t think that’s case, good you. different situations coming different conclusions aren’t crazy. We’re working different considerations coming different decision you. fantastic news! Cannot wait results, hoping best doubts well tbh.

Once ability vaccinate kids/teens booster shots ready ready go! light still far away, finally see light end tunnel. T_T Selling Canada rile Trumpsters much misspelled “punishment”. lot comments ignoring well immunocompromised people still rely herd immunity degree vaccines effective group things like chemo immunosuppressants. hey, let's take chances COVID can't see it. Sure, guess, use rates new infections estimate level immunity within population. rates going remaining stable, little immunity, new infections trending downwards, sufficient immunity given current behavior begin rolling precautions back rates stop falling. Repeat reach point completely back normal yet new infection rates still fall. no? resume must pretty good. working years 1-15 years old ;) Wait, thought deaths didn’t increase? must bad flu season. Mind blow Pfizer already trial boosters assume already data that. hope lack commenting mean side effects. first shot effects minimal, sore arm, second, bad, would annoying deal multiple times year. Dental gas brute force.

If actually wanting get done, strap first... J&amp;J’s vaccine 66.3% effectiveness overall 74.4% effectiveness United States, “100% efficacy hospitalization death virus,” said Dr. Irons. “That's really focus understand efficacy numbers getting concerned. lower numbers less severe problems, like simply symptoms, shorter periods time. longer term efficacy different vaccines similar. got second Pfizer dose, honestly apart little soreness arm feel side effects. happened first too, know people get much worse side effects second dose that's universal. get 2x per year immunity lasts 6 months. less needed Find mass vaccination site, they'll tell have. Add one shit column. We’ve fucked PR around things much it’s wonder people idea trust. much money make per dose? 2nd pfizer yesterday, I'm currently dying work.  need booster shot always medical people cautious saying need maintain level covid mitigation.

I’m student college offering J&amp;J vaccines. didn’t want even stuff looking elsewhere. J&amp;J got paused, next day university emailed us saying they’ll administering Moderna shots got first shot today, I’m healthy 24 year old conditions. You’re getting downvoted sub overly alarmist. panicked constantly everything covid. EVERY situation end world. people can’t stop alarmist AZ.

Would love something pop Pfizer/Moderna 99% people sub Americans jerk received “best” vaccine. Fuck place lol US never locked up, stay home orders. people side effects aside arm soreness likely felt first shot. Take ibuprofen unlikely event fever. basically identical. generous 
And that’s forced/mandatory flu shots places like hospitals schools
My point is, literally exact opposite good thing Pfizer says preparing too. think trying figure variants, any, need booster shots, produce vaccine. Good news lot less urgency plenty time plan it, already facilities producing 10-20 million vaccines per week. Actually already hundred vaccinated individuals hospitalized Covid response pretty measured.

Edit: hospitalized hundred dead, 74 died change alternative risk though, choose whether take vaccine vacuum. making calculation vaccine less likely kill taking vaccine is. different risk vaccine would need drive 250 miles order take it. known reason mix. know stipulating certain age group throw 100% number. Maybe ones using inactive viruses, mRna vaccines effective though without many issues. likewise fast spreads decent chance someone getting vaccinated also getting real thing simultaneously. actually locked beginning. 
Instead everyone could still work, whatever. half assed price 

But see sweaty basketball players running casino floors packed bars open, silly rules like alcohol x time alcohol food walk table unmasking. can’t help question lots things. mean seem condescending took way. 

""So that's stance, talking vaccines causing blood clots all.""

I say talk it. welcome open discourse.

You're correct, peer review vaccines causing blood clots.

My problem headlines people take face value confirmation bias perpetuate little context. I'm saying context matters see little days. give shit none give shit population 100,000,000 individuals thought (which roughly current vaccinated population US) 90% effective means 10 million people still catch spread disease, making whole ordeal take even longer get over. 

Now get wrong. lock away, need continue take reasonable precautions ( ie hand washing, mask wearing, social distancing) engage high risk behaviors like mass gathering little longer. faster break chain transmission, sooner get back normal. Hopefully not. lot speculation around high potential mixing vaccines. know lot it, seem like people currently saying going unsafe combination sub lost credibility perform cost-benefit analysis human lives failed correctly early months pandemic. 

Funny worked out. fucking clapping emote trash, fuck twitter.  there's kind breeze though, see one could receive enough viral load infected outdoors. want thank civil conversation me. “the people”? polling everyone? live republic elected officials make decisions us. ever get J&amp;J going again, could 2 week stay deal  Lots people southern NH started wearing masks CDC recommended them. Lots people southern NH work Massachusetts, Boston area hard hit start, example many.

The mask mandate November didn’t change things much. city already one everyone family wearing masks since late spring. vaccines need booster every year, truly screwed. central Europe, single-digit percentage people get flu shot, 1) good luck getting people get regular covid shots 2) probably even done first round vaccination within year, governments utterly incapable creating working infrastructure that, matter big supply vaccines be. That’s purposefully dense considering argument tho. you’re going discussion dishonest standpoint it’s useless continue. kids won’t vaccinated don’t think scientific community going sacrfirce Anyone uses clapping emoji like telling world worth talking to. I'm speaking ignorantly here, assume Phizer Moderna (and probably J&amp;J) done supplying US, shipments Europe go way lot Europe vaccinated Christmas. always one month. That's one takes statements like seriously anymore. gathered, company / researchers behind AZ initially promised basically open source vaccine. would particularly allowed local production AZ vaccine prepared also Latin America, Africa etc., regions far left behind vaccine procurement. 

The Gates foundation swooped money gave vague justification unsafe produce vaccines *that kind* country. sold out. One (of many) twitter threads things really open america kids aren’t vaccinated? think it’ll easy people say it’s safe, we’re sacrificing kids, ect. That's FDA, basically. vaccinated get COVID mildly, mean always get mildly?

No one knows. bright side, statistics produced world majority population vaccinated. people get vaccinated, probabilities plummet even looks like COVID transmission dramatically drops you’re vaccinated. chances getting almost zero chances passing almost zero, chances getting basically zero. 

Barring crazy mutations, see us completely eliminating virus within generation. make sense you? 
I also don’t socials TV maybe that’s difference? 

And I’m normal American. see throughout days people actually following random mandates fwiw. vaccines enough

They are, need big supply Europe getting next months. anyone taken second dose moderna Pfizer, experience bad? side effects worse second dose medicine take side effects? would certainly help cited kind science facts, otherwise looks like pharma CEO looking cash enormous revenue stream entire world needing take shots every year. linked site nothing excel file download, excel file available English.

Ya know... changed mind. think know everything need know level scientific literacy and, extension, value unsupported assertions. worry finding source, waste time clicking it. Take care. Thursday became third country Europe U.K. Italy reach unwanted milestone 100,000 COVID-19-related deaths new infections deaths surged due virus variants.

France coming 100,000 deaths 1,530 deaths per million, UK 127,191 deaths 1,866 per million, Italy 115,937a 1,920 per million. Exactly. New Zealand, dont even know anyone got COVID. would risk dying taking vaccine proven deadly? Yes, good points.  Thanks. one things hope get proper data near future. relatively young healthy person I'm concerned dying extremely concerned potential long-term effects. Hopefully vaccines prevent well prevent hospitalization/death. AstraZeneca vaccine infinitely likely cause brain clot Pfizer Moderna vaccines. 

Am right? upstate NY put mine keep lips chapped.

I don’t like masks much wear safety reasons, look forward day it’s safe enough ditch them. sure live US, getting flu vaccine takes much effort buying cup coffee. available virtually everywhere, free, takes 10 minutes. hope so, last two days second vaccine sucked, least would know plan couple days next time round. Yeah shoulda clarified talking today (which, one day trend) worldometer. really observation. link great though, thx!!   becomes regular thing maybe could buy one. maybe find way people get shots though? Anything help ensure flu shots get used covid shots get used seems like good thing. Thank you! think people probably misunderstood initial comment negative thing. CEO Pfizer. Imagine much revenue company stands make vaccine entire world take every year. I'd take grain salt.  would impossible generate proof data good job anyway CDC. No, cannot. don’t know number, won’t get vaccinated, take precautions follow proper hygiene. want lose friends family pandemic- putting blinders increase odds. It’s hypothetical. Christ. CDC say couple months back think like 5 times people 'rona positive tests... like 100 million people already infected? dream article existed? let kids get vaccinated. best wait im 18 choose. point countries consider closing borders India completely 6 months, effectively turn India island, airports accept flight landing India, place blockades rail tracks go across border India, armed roadblocks every border crossing, deny ship India ability dock, cut world them, let run rife vaccinate fast possible open shit managed...  You’re wrong. media profits fear sells advertising space process Maybe, dont participate diminish effectiveness do. 100% favor personal choice bigger picture ramification. great analogy *voluntary* vaccinations.

Dysfunctional immunity primary action causes severe long-term COVID problems. Putting immune system constant alert healthy, vaccines talking that. different mechanism. Golly, almost loosening restrictions vaccinated meaningful % states population knock effect outbreak virus! doesn’t really depend anything. you’re outside, mask unnecessary 99.9% time.

I live place successfully suppressed covid see imperative cambodia act promptly.

Someone USA europe looks numbers ‘meh.....’ fair enough, CA opening pretty quickly days. Study

This article almost 3 months old.

But: I'm buying some! vaccine literally injects covid so.... saying.  Yes, technically say 100% herd immunity, heavily suggested it. Don’t know downvoted lol, players various sports retired due lasting effects deaths vaccines though? There's risks many medical interventions, usually rare. Yes, people danger others. Thank you. Agreed, think need metric ASAP this. people keep harping magic Cells? can’t think vaccine isn’t judged durable antibody response. entirely. lot .008% people contracted covid One caveat. whenever every adult opportunity get vaccine + 6 weeks take effect.

Hate people say jump back normal second rules say eligible shot. I'm Jon Snow even know nothing.
But sounds quite weird.
Okay....so somehow stops virus replicating nose.
By time, lungs already full virus ? I'm confused measuring timeline immunity. going antibody titers? really whole picture?

It seems cells learn *create* antibodies spike protein, would keep ability forever. I'm understanding booster rationale. anything pandemic shown us long haul. get vaccine, we'll likely get virus, eventually. Especially many get vaccines. honestly know believe. I'm still getting vaccinated (2nd dose Pfizer next week) hoping vaccinated means worries around me.

I state know heard statements, ""you spread vaccinated"" ""you cannot spread vaccinated"". argument could still spread beginning vaccinations reason still wear mask. stated due vaccine administered something extent virus could technically nose period time antibodies killed it, time could spread it. Whereas developed vaccine different way antibodies would already near nose kill said virus right gate.

Again, know correct. scientist means. I'm regurgitating spewed. using lot technical terms obviously cared remember.  fail see point here. absolutes real world.

An antibody test close absolute gets. either antibodies don't, set threshold aren't. Administratively whether physician chooses use antibody titer simply administer booster physician unless guidance otherwise.

Either get vaccinated AZ appear like trust vaccine despite says public. Speculation, would assume Canada get vaccinated week US decides we've vaccinated enough. We're vaccinating millions day contracted far doses need.

In countries can't afford vaccination, things could last lot longer. many people started going college COVID? did, best decision I’ve made. seeing family know vaccinated, we're still eating restaurants going crowded places. take store recently, getting more. :)

The CDC also said people can’t get COVID they’re vaccinated. CDC sometimes wrong.

There logical way conclude chance getting COVID surfaces 1 10,000. Think would possibly calculate that.

If someone comes COVID, surfaces immediately ruled cause anyone else household ever leaves house. always instead presumed infected grocery store, example. course, one leaves house, there’s COVID house’s surfaces.

There’s feasible way measure odds catching COVID surfaces without deliberately contaminating people’s hands touch eyes, nose, mouth. likely never happen severity disease.

Did assume CA problems? think that's well-known fact several decades: think there's ever effective government Brazil, there's unlikely one time soon. Latin America general pretty synonymous poor leadership.

As soon pandemic started, lot people saying many parts world, starvation would bigger risk virus itself. Moderna, sore arm lasted day less sore second time. Barely noticed difference. dreams. Genie ain’t going back bottle  really related arm itchy flu shot. I'm pretty sure band aid. skin sticky part red anything. grandfather never really recovered Polio entire life. lucky permanently paralyzed lost something like half lung function. glad see common sense  Live free die. Ok Drax, do. I’m arguing it’s taboo skeptical vaccine. You’re supposed accept ask questions. Also I’m surprised NPR article/title mostly ad hominem attack guy without even mentioning said it’s factual information. CNN headline: 

There's decent chance get COVID even clot-causing shot ^^^^ mean they've voted Democrat 7 last 8 presidential elections

By ""conservative"" mean Republican, that's battle lines silly wars drawn even approved use yet age range? I’m surprised aren’t SEC laws really come across marketing. sure facts spun here? I'm ears. I'm fully vaccinated parent unvaccinated child. know long covid thing, know well enough long term implications covid way flu. point hard quantify risk point, even calculate current mortality. much risk want expose unvaccinated child choice. IMHO right wrong here. I'll feel much better mine vaccinated. Currently trialed already available otc! Worst thing could happen helps sinuses allergy season. Looks low risk, high reward me. 😎 Private employment private you? certainly would consider employment public. statistics published transmission airplanes? Exactly. many 220M unvaccinated people gotten covid time period. 

Let’s say 2.8M (this estimate 48k cases per day 60 days) 
2.88M/ 5,800 = 496 times less likely covid fully vaccinated OR. 99.8% effective preventing covid  AZ reduced hospitilisations 94%, Pfizer reduced 85% relatively large study Scotland.

Abs demonstrated 93% Pfizer recipients 87% AZ recipients, however greater cell response spike protein found AZ recipients.

AZ affordable easier storage requirements make attractive vaccine many countries.

Also, statement incorrect. may less effective B117 variant non-B117 variants, still effective. 60 go doctor say ""put list Astra"". people eligible Astra getting less less first place others wanting wait long. 

No, problem all. hey, make one ... Good know. least soonish Yes. Suffers stroke less three hours getting vaccine. story comes literally day J + J suspended US...coincidence? Maybe put bad batch something. Good points. check 3-4 times daily month finally land appointment. work home internet. like playing game me. Conditions changing, sites going offline, info unavailable, etc.. 

A lot people going want monkey around get appointment. Grapeseed xylitol! use sinuses already. Imagine lame condescending, guy-who-posts-about-Sprint-corporate-discounts Read person responded again.

50 thousand unvaccinated cases per 1.7m people compared 246 vaccinated cases **in time frame.**

That’s 99% reduction, adjustments timeframe population size. Must little rats. Everyone knows need least 2x6 kill rat article right point age differences. Brazil much bigger elderly population one might expect, given stereotypes poorer countries. I've seen, also higher obesity levels, hard statistics that.

However, think biggest factor CFR good statistic, especially comes countries limited testing resources limited record keeping.

As another poster said, Brazil able report deaths; likely actual number deaths India much higher official stats suggest. fact, article says pandemic, 20% deaths India recorded all.

Conversely, India massively superior testing capacity. According worldometers, India done almost 10 times many tests Brazil found number cases, they're presumably picking bigger number mild cases, would obviously drive CFR down. Either get vaccines arms, get vaccines population centers. prob, that’s understandable. anti-vax community pretty diverse, many come completely different backgrounds wouldn’t agree anything else this. kinda surprised realized this. break ship vaccine anywhere enough America. government expected though specifically contracted EU vaccines.

I blame mean say I'm angry them. terrible outbreak funded lot money vaccines understandable want people first. suspect government would made here. EU rarity think, I'm grateful. August, 2020. says found evidence.

Do recent source theory given up?

Just curious.. seems like ""populations previous experience viruses distant cousins could leave immunity populations descendants"" seems like logical theory (I data)..

And Brazil.. wonder much population indigenous Well still wear masks stay away people suppose you’re right lot people don’t is. might also need variant-boosters years get global pandemic control many mutations happening.

Then perhaps new coronavirus variant every decade so, we've let tue box, worth infrastructure ready vaccinate right away deal shit again... 20% state fully vaccinated. see can't wait another month, point every single person offered first dose, majority received 2 doses. 

[New York Times COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout horse race except factual accuracy, misconstrue stance mask mandate.

New Hampshire leading country lot percentage people received first dose, 56% (the next highest state, Maine, stands 47%). percentage state ""fully vaccinated"" stands **27%**, 20%.

New Hampshire successful using doses delivered. used 98% doses delivered (the next highest state, Wisconsin, stands 88%).

While 20% figure would accurate states (like Mississippi Arkansas), let's give credit credit due undercut successes getting vaccines people's arms. lead country percentage population vaccinated. hit 40%. Cases per million flattened - bet cases start decline week two. value article months ago looked early CDC data vs CDC saying actual data? Sounds lot like issue minuscule thought process. lot kids wearing masks going school full time. remote majority year. many parents taking kids events, restaurants, etc? Makes big difference kids getting sick. Fear sells  grandmother probably get first shot today tomorrow! I'm relieved arguments fellow black people

I surprised hear much vaccine hesitancy among black community, especially consider liberal trend usually conservative types whining ""no mask, shot!""

Need get word convince people get shot. you? fuck....2nd shot Saturday....I cannot WAIT least next door Michigan \-80s uncommon all, also there's reason can't store mRNA normal -20 freezer reasonable amounts time. rush get vaccine approved -80 storage tested safe. where’s conversation nutrition vitamin D? Maybe put money behind messaging promoted healthier living programs people doctors, wouldn’t even 1% mortality. Let’s see far drive focusing health rather beating everyone head science facts. We’ve whole year wasted opportunity, I’ll agree. even personally get virus, we'll resigned social purgatory indefinitely. virus going go away own.  majority spread happening among young people, least vaccinated demographic. would guess persistent caseload coupled w/ dropping deaths. Russia? France probably fourth. Germ theory? Please read actual science educate yourself: . Vaccinated persons overwhelmingly spread virus. carriers. also almost 0 reason individuals get vaccine baseless fearmongering isn’t excuse kids fall behind. legitimate reasons doesn’t make sense, schools must make reasonable accommodations teachers. two friends go vaccines 2 months ago (work healthcare) got Covid last week. Sooo, pretty wild odds..  live conservative area; many people anti-mask anti-vaccine, sadly many people used consider friends:(  damn pollen goes away, hell yea.

Haven't even consider allergy meds yet :)

Spring allergies usually pretty rough me. Garbage title. Headlines constantly like frustrating explained people read past it. One worst examples ""immunity lasts least x months"".

**People:** heard immunity lasts 6 months!

**Reality:** 6 months data, can't make claim proof. means next month ""at least 7 months"" on.  Link? don’t know long immunity catching covid naturally lasts. Research already shown vary lot person person people reinfected within 6 months even sooner. vaccinate everybody likely 1) stronger defense 2) lasts longer. Especially potential 3th dose given later year, talking about. 

If test someone antibodies, don’t vaccinate month later immunity gone, person still think he’s protected act like it. vaccinate, research shows exactly long expect someone stay protected 30% fully vaccinated sometime weekend. 50% adults least one shot. Look Bloomberg trend line - it’s slowing down. don’t struggle abide restrictions, level vaccine distribution that’s occurring country, begin conversation roll back restrictions. 

Restrictions temporary measure contain uncontrolled spread covid. solution pandemic, multiple extremely effective vaccines, vaccines distributed population increasingly excessive numbers, need start discussing ending, rolling back, restrictions timetable return normal. 

Wanting conversation doesn’t make anti mask, anti vaxx, covid denier bullshit label people automatically put anyone that’s okay restrictions indefinitely.

We increasingly exponentially reaching point restrictions placed upon us outweigh net benefit society give us. certain point (a point anyone else can’t conclusively pinpoint), would better society whole go back normal rather continue restrictions order save increasingly minuscule amount lives. Better headline CNN's lmao you’re able social distance yes wearing masks even outside. Bruh imagining .008% lot people won’t take unless forced kicking screaming. Take it’s worth, hunch it’s gonna create tension boiling point helps fuel vaccine passport style stuff. Who'd thought half-ass job would lead poor results? lol That's great hear. long it? got dose 1 wish good dreams! Enjoy those! live, opened March. Half parents aren’t comfortable sending kids back yet. think like 40% person attendance moment. Theres lots reasons vaccine yet. vaccine also make immune virus. going good vaccinated doctor teacher gets sick starts spreading virus unvaccinated spouse, child co-workers. 

How fucking 21st century many people want argue germ theory? Exactly! doctor told thing. Respectfully agree obviously good things; however, CDC guidance distancing schools 3 feet, adequate nearly every classroom nation point. funding would great classrooms meet requirements distancing least girlfriend's mom pissed got Pfizer. said I'm sterile, DNA rewritten we're going die seven years. Without herd immunity death others. People die either way First shot 80% efficacy two weeks, grows time. yes basically. question is, Data get Covid? Nepotism, ugly. Same! felt worse first shot (Pfizer) second. “worse” mean first, arm hurt tired. second, slight headache, took Tylenol fine, arm didn’t even hurt. Midwest life didn’t really change much lot people. It’s almost laughable see people West coast celebrating getting haircut first time year. Like god damn, states got ravaged Covid anyway get haircut. Many new deaths COVID19. Source: Science Daily Facebook. even Facebook account valid point you’ve made population different. even then, first people got vaccinated healthcare workers frontline workers much higher exposure virus begin with. 

If tested people weren’t fully vaccinated received least one dose, skew data toward vaccine less efficient. despite still shows high efficacy. spike protein causing problem, expect problems mRNA/traditional vaccines (like China)... don't.

Instead, JJ/AZ problem, use adenovirus vector (not identical)... probably random coincidence. I’m sure happen time. - around vaccinated people low risk non vaccinated people, per current cdc guidance. Let’s face it, per article it’s overly safe CDC guidance updated soon. got COVID mild enough ignored it. case, recorded never went hospital.  yes, people read this. Go hang vaxxed friends essentially...return “normal”? forgot add:

So far 2020-2021 Flu season, 1 kid &lt; 18 died according scientific studies:

* ""among patients younger 18 years, rates ICU admission significantly higher COVID-19 influenza.""
* ""Mortality ten-times higher children aged 11–17 years COVID-19 patients age group influenza (5 [1·1%] 458 vs 1 [0·1%] 804). findings supported study 4784 children adolescents COVID-19 Brazil study children adolescents Thing though, lot shaking hands hugging taking pictures together outdoor event, kind negates airflow distance aspect outdoors. yes much safer outdoors mean handshakes hugging. Honestly, messaging weird. body generally keep antibodies diseases immunity blood times. Unless suggesting somehow human biology fundamentally different COVID...

I see even say booster needed, aside variant protection. data know showing decreased ability combat serious infection initial two doses.

I'm simply going get third dose alternative mild asymptomatic case COVID. I'd rather take risk hope catching particular year suffer almost certain multiple day side effects second Moderna given every year. need variants, jab me, I'm gonna like it... CDC also said masks effective early pandemic. blindly trust them.

My doctor said makes sense take risk getting vaccine a) I've already COVID Sept 2020 mild symptoms b) Two blood tests shown strong antibodies. Ironically I’ve gone entire past year without getting single common cold, sniffles sick even ever since wearing mask public work. I’ve never breathed easier well, masks trap moisture near nose helpful dry, cold winter months. 

I think we’ll always see people wear masks long mandates end crowded public settings like airports malls, much like Asian countries years. highly doubt journalists' managers *that* controlling write. doubt levels hierarchy.

The real issue journalism like 100% maximizing views. that?

**Clickbait**

And obvious clickbait make people feel like situation getting worse. Today, saw CNN article titled **So far, 5,800 fully vaccinated people caught Covid anyway US, CDC says**. (not going link b/c deserve views) Louis CK said best, need reintroduce lions human society. Nice try AstraZeneca don’t go outside ever again? Huh? helpful, thank you! I’ve also heard people got first dose mRNA, allergic reaction, got J&amp;J shot shortly after. made feel better as, get J&amp;J getting mRNA shot, stands reason could go way around two weeks second vaccine shot *then matter person next vaccinated not*. *not* vaccinated wear mask. Wear two seriously concerned. shared 1.5 million loan near enough. Canada 38 million citizens. spacing 1st dose 2nd like 4 months apart running short vaccines. according fully vaccinated people can

* Visit fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks physical distancing
* Visit unvaccinated people single household low risk severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks physical distancing
* Refrain quarantine testing following known exposure asymptomatic
* Resume domestic travel refrain testing travel self-quarantine travel.
* Refrain testing leaving United States international travel (unless required destination) refrain self-quarantine arriving back United States. question is: would want drink budweiser? Sorry hear man, family friend mine well significant leg atrophy. like third thickness healthy leg. I've two blood tests year. showed strong antibodies COVID according doctor recommended take vaccine time.

I also mild symptoms COVID September 2020. think there's good chunk people go way get vaccine early get walk-in appointment like Kroger CVS go it. It'll slow trickle whatever high-demand threshold only-when-convenient crowd, least large portion vaccine hesitant eventually get anyway. time, “mad rush.” single-shot booster may given way flu shots done fall - city clinics, annual physical, employee clinics held large employers, college health departments, every pharmacy. is, annual boosters even needed. Could end every 10 years like tetanus shot. don’t know yet. would better waited everyone wanted vaccine could get one, I'm sure that's politically possible point Come rural NC...we mask mandate nary mask seen ‘The Walmarts’...just fucking infuriates 🤬 Teachers prioritized vaccines reason. There’s zero reason point. cdc every scientific governing body also said vaccines prevent asymptomatic spread. 

Do think grocery store workers food delivery workers luxury sitting home? factory workers producing goods consume daily? There’s zero scientific studies pointing spread within schools CDC guidance educators said time safe person instruction.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

(and control group) specifically selected likely exposed. exposures may high viral load, viral load may matter. always skipped flu shot mom diagnosed breast cancer. remission keep sake immunocompromised. That's thought 2M July doubt making difference, simply can't enforce shutdown, could i'm sure would. Lab leak zoonotic mutually exclusive. Zoonosis transmission animal humans. Lab leak hypothesis first cluster spread started 

Lab leak mean engineered designed even human-altered. exclude animal origin. means breach containment lab specimen resulted local cluster spread Publix. say I'm uninsured find out, supposedly denied vaccines (this according pharmacist talking to). Sure. think 10-15% though? allergies I'm vaccinated completely (I kids) I'm walking around outside without mask. mind I'd rather walk friends fully vaccinated actually know look like lol. miss seeing faces. Also hanging lot houses I'm fully vaccinated (they also fully vaccinated). Cause otherwise never going end... I'll probably wear mask flu season though I'm sick something sure least. Inside yes I'll wear mask time I'm going go eat restaurants movie theaters stuff I'm fully vaccinated. mean I’m ready admit I’m salty lol. Imo done ”selfish” way, even though admirable EU ready spread vaccines around still. EU “you gotta show example” mindset lot things good bad thing, imo case taken care population first. Huh? vaccine free...they ask insurance. makes sense Tbf people blood cancer much bigger issues COVID. Also mRNA technology much easier quickly modify work virus.

It's going godsend stopping future viral outbreaks, imagine world vaccine produced weeks virus discovered. moment there's still approval hurdles hopefully eventually get point confident without needing stage 3 trials. thing Adenovirus vaccines obvious link, blood clot cause extremely rare specific. seems mRNA cases include normal blood clots, orders magnitude common way harder separate coincidence causality. office, 35% say get vaccine. believe liberal hoax used overthrow President. something wearing mask means guns confiscated, get connection. surprising number people opposed vaccine. mention vaccines taking away constitutional rights. know long term effects *any* cohort new illness. even politicians sending kids school favor now. hardly swing dead cat without finding articles like US gave people money every country world last year. go? got shot Walgreens even look insurance card. say uninsured? 32, extremely low risk category. able get appointment restrictions lifted. Uhm, no? 

I give shit US good bad, I'm laughing American commenters really believe US' response significantly better others even example follow point making circlejerks countries, especially countries arguably performed better pandemic metric worth measuring. sure US vs EU. Bad policies bad policies. defend country implementing them. Source? Yes, trial, saying 100th even 1st kid ""grave danger"" overstating risks given know far True total misrepresented, kids probably also misrepresented leading proportional change. mean, loads people.

You're right, watch Track Field, Rowing, Swimming, Triathlon, Gymnastics Handball regular day, damn love top end international competition best world. surprised, lot people 75 drive greatest support networks. believe continue inch them, next dr appt reason go medical facility. Sadly, makes lot sense. 


Vaccination may way stop thing all. I'm gonna challenge that. Vaccinated people magnifying glass hear them. Time tell. Contrary US, part vaccines produced EU sent countries. let's push 250 million doses Biden's first 100 days. school district vocational school half day. go home school morning go vocational school afternoon visa versa. Lol wonder US one highest cumulative death rates world. definitely insane thing done phase 3 moderna ended Nov 30, 2020 pfizer also right around there.. 

there zero reports cvt trials.... likely observational study authorized... trials... Well tired people calling somewhere hellhole knowing nothing it. tell long unfortunate people call die broken system, system needs fixed. know German millionaire moved America, got cancer bankrupt half year America. came back Germany got necessary treatment. Problem people care kids, get problem can't calling broken. typical ""ridiculous"" waiting time get often cited knowledge things work. Btw get regular free checkups guess planning needed. Sinovac's real advantage cheap hell seemingly really easy mass-produce, widespread poorer countries like latin america. Getting vaccines like Pfizer AZ extremely difficult expensive governments, Moderna J&amp;J might well exist yet (J&amp;J also still approval stage least country, even blood clots). far seems Pfizer prioritized doctors, older people get either three, people know getting Sinovac Seems bit early demand peak... Me: understand people may prefer online education, personally enjoy time home :) 

You: up

Lol ok weekly death rate US 3/4 Germany

You're right, Germany surpassed past couple days. changes anything US lowest point ever.

From March 2020, yes. I'm legitimately confused. Japan population 126M US 328M. 
 
The cases winter surge peaked 7k per day Japan, versus 300k per day peak US. growing numbers around 4.5k per day US still 74k per day. What's failure? awesome numbers.

Not trying start anything, Im confused. Im US, taking pandemic seriously, WFH everyday, got Pfizer 1st shot 2 weeks ago. seriously doubt stores require masks memorial day. think summer hit people like screw mask mandate vaccinated months now

I disagree. think big box stores grocery require July. vaccine category 5 hurricane incoming some,
 Canada That's true lot AZ vaccines sending elsewhere they're approved around 900 dying day. people? Elderly? non-vaccinated? would love info trend already headed 100M doses 100 days took office. USA continues trend. I'm bummed. I've denied vaccine insurance another state. leave state start pandemic I've crashing relative's home since then. I'm unemployed still pandemic. unemployment insurance preventing getting vaccine. would able get insurance. like metric fully vaccinated metric. got pfizer shot 2 weeks ago, higher degree protection anyone J+J yet dont count fully vaxed do.

it competition. good shape, continue mask up/social distance can, especially around unvaccinated people.

btw, fully protected pfizer 7 days 2nd shot, 14 days. Real men eat brass I'm seeing signs slowing down. Scroll State Vaccinations Stack graph Pfizer is. Source claim? members fuck up.

It means nothing. fucked how? Ireland, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia, Italy, Portugal Cyprus extremely different approaches responses. ^Because small portion followers fucking morons. got arrogant poised thinking fould control virus NPI due experience summer. Hence failed ramp production like US did. Ja, und weil idioten wie du zu dumm zum kacken sind sitzen wir immer noch alle zu hause rum. Fickende Hölle. guess depends live. U.S., vaccinating 3M people day, given least first shots 50% adult population, continue see hospitalizations deaths decline.

There might unpleasant surprise line variants, now, everyone eligible vaccination, seems whether get sick 90% hands. hope right highly doubt happen. couldn’t it. school great worked out. attend alternative accredited university. graduate student it’s mostly reading writing papers. much changed. It’s truly work put education. Still wish tuition reduced. Asia ok level. Compared great West quite godl, including bongland, report comes. funny good vaccination made anglos forget death count. Another mega trial done Germany 2,2 million people. 
I wonder EU see ""full immunization"" considering vaccination passport roll-out. I'm second shot soon I'm sure stay AZ switch mRNA. know, read many areas enough vaccines stored,, enough arms. that's said maximum uptake US allow vaccines leave country everybody offer vaccine. entire world badly needs protected well. Paris 2024. LA 2028 Olympics. doesn’t mean because. know pregnant lady received Pfizer month ago problem. obey rules lick boot reeeeeeeeeee!!! someone use work hotels suggest even without covid... especially remotes use glassware unless single use pre wrapped stuff. Also leave anything counters bathrooms, walk floor without shoes. fair, US also stockpile AZ vaccine, even though approved use US. idea health care workers poorer nations unvaccinated US unused doses unconscionable. LOL, okay. Meanwhile, real world... Ramp certainly took U.S. 89 days administer first 100 million doses, milestone reached March 12. second 100 million come 36 days.

Our current pace less 30 days clicked BBC article linked article found towards stress risk death age group still ""very low"" - current figures suggest **only 0.58% Brazil's 345,287 Covid deaths date 0-9 year exact stats looking for, certainly indicates title clickbait nonsense.

That's 2,000 kids dead. even know many survived, got health issues. easy say older people, probably would die anyway, many kids normally die? Especially 9? Same. ""college educated crowd, went good school, lives city"" probably 95% 1st shot vaccinated right now.  Hey result exchange I've watching latest twiv podcasts reading reddit threads found post summarizes condenses latest findings, got Dr. Racaniello's personal approval recent AMA, thought you. Nice! summer looking rosy EU UK. Keep numbers going!! I'm disappointed trial near me, can't sign kids it.

The faster vaccinated, better.

The study dosing, whether safe. Yes, 86 days since January 20th. hit 100M doses administered, trend already set hit 200M 40 days, ""ambitious"" goal hit 200M 43 days amazing advertised.

Still achievement, achievement scientific logistics people much either President. Oh ya could definitely see turnover rate mentioned working Domestic abusers use logic, remember reading first 100 million waiting line first Moderna shot. Today got second crossed 200 million. Absolutely wild think got far month. I'm happy y'all, congrats! Yes thank you. know numbers reading comments realized mine wrong. awesome want visit Hockey Hall Fame Toronto I'm really bummed. keep seeing news every adult eligible April 19--but entirely true. Vermont Governor Phil Scott permitting state college students sign time. feels like poor public health policy (we're situation likely spread) like big ol' FU use following guidelines campuses. 

It immensely frustrating nearly every adult country eligible, except us. 

I feel powerless. know way preventing college students signing up, also know college students around want to/ planning signing we're supposed (because we're generally responsible people want abuse system.) I'm already vaccinated, hard friends punished young responsible. *is* weeks' delay, delay means seniors can't end year loosened restrictions ability hug friends last time graduating. 

(On related note, gratitude country well terms vaccinations empathy rest world. perspective, also feel upset time. probably feel hurtful rest country delayed amount time students singled limited, even though course choose scenario one.) Hindsight 20/20. mistake trusting vaccine procurement supranational entity really power personnel intervene support suppliers within EU.

Should made alliance European national governments avoid competing compliment one another's efforts. Let German, French, Dutch, etc governments nimble aggressive developing domestic production, agreeing fuck process bid contracts, share results fairly across EU without prejudice.

It's tragedy countries like Germany France able spin industrial technological might like could done benefit entire EU beyond. Instead handed chequebook entity can't even order warehouse built. Maybe elected officials, certainly ones top. Good. Still around 5000 deaths week though sad. know there's data available UK second dose?. found data Israel suggests numbers preventing severe cases around 92%. true 60 years old get Biontech Moderna right special illness job. seemingly apply Merkel, truly young, 70+ years old get Biontech Moderna. give AZ 60-69 years old Merkel right age. reality various government entities want official Vaccine Passport done fantastic job essentially making inefficient get valid data confirm vaccinated. There's single central registry go to. purposely it. make vaccine passport stuff far harder implement less reliable.

Given time development &amp; testing, health-centric nature, difficulty authentication validating vaccination, etc. really see vaccine passports becoming big US. go state Republican Party working bill would automatic lockdowns tied case numbers.

Once case numbers got past threshold stopped pushing bill forward.

So don’t actually want anything, create appearance might consider it. think might idiots quietly decided stop idiots bit get vaccinated. Sadly “maximum uptake” going synonymous “maximum immunization.” many hesitant people here, it’s insane. even occur, docs prepared know correctly diagnose treat (which differs normal blood cloth treatment since autoimmune reaction). vaccinated individual unlikely transmit covid, I’ve said repeatedly, science there. CDC’s director said vaccinated individuals likely carry virus. CDC generally behind curve scientific consensus comes issues— example, recently officially admitted surface spread covid almost nonexistent, even though known established scientific community pretty long time

Do you’d like please evaluate sources don’t spread incorrect info, like “we don’t know” effect vaccines transmission officially know one single solitary person life hasn’t gotten least first shot. population already hospice otherwise sick get Yes, that's main thing need figure trials. Yeah. isn’t zero risk option here. lot parenting weighing various risks trying make best guess limited information. kind scary. feel like vaccine equals basically getting covid. expect vaccines won’t approved kids get time kids hope it’s mild them. trial opened area would jump it. curfews enforced private gatherings? cops know invite friends house? wonder states ""herd immunity""

Maybe less populated/dense ones? say warranted, simply -- though rare -- seems cause unusual type blood clot requires special strategy treat (as opposed administering blood thinner).

Pausing rollout way alerting doctors issue developing strategy treating types clots. sucks we're constant war vaccine hesitancy, done. Bullshit, now: rules applied anybody else. time Astrazeneca approved people 65 first studies Astrazeneca enough old people involved. twist events, vaccine used people 60 series severe health complications younger people. least 60+ year olds high covid risks. Maybe roll universal healthcare every time, beat us time? Socialism uses all. Hmm? Prio3I getting vaccinated Bavaria Moderna tomorrow. I’ve choice. 100 20.5 doesn’t sound bad, it’s patterns specific groups risk severely elevated compared would normally expect. many people don’t get that?

And don’t „see“ data vaccines. significant patterns reported, there’s simply nothing see now. There’s something hidden purpose make AZ vaccine look bad. really think PEI Norway countries give shit who‘s selling producing vaccines? Well tend agree herd behavior,,
 think won’t May, certainly grocery Oh, good thing told stay eff home outside year. Oh man rough. second time worse? mind asking field in? gradually getting back day day, good, feel ya. chance getting vaccine soon? know I'm patriotic country, neither birth country, America, parents came from. joke lol Vaccination uptake slowing here. give ignorant uneducated reasons wont get it. state one giant echo chamber unfortunately vocal majority anti covid dont see need get vaccinated. spike protein also different. Similar technology different drug content. really admire compassion towards humanity. me, admit. I’m sorry said Germany hellhole. You’re right, truly know nothing Germany itself, read news lockdown policy. 

I feel bad course give whenever can. I’m sure know big reason American wages highest world though, right? think funds cheaper costs Germany? Taxpayer dollars. enjoy taxed wazoo pay guy eats 10 Big Macs day’s heart attack. System broken course, gonna lie there, think going public system always right answer. Better regulation private hospitals getting getting big pharma fuck would wonders.

Now vacation time...that’s something I’m jealous of. I’m one students. don’t know go here. Good. Double it. never would shitty thing good leader. *On average* 3 day gap administration reporting. Much vaccine reported today given well that. example, 340k reported first doses today given on/before April 2nd. Definitely nothing concerned about. clinics stringent safety storage guidelines follow. curious, [CDC's guidance planning vaccination [vaccine storage &amp; handling take tush? point thing really tell people get vaccine. Everything else basically futile. Kinda got achy feeling. Nothing real bad, thankfully don’t think it’s allergies (although kick ass weather changes soon). Thanks well wishes though! needed sick day J&amp;J vaccine. count. awful, I'm past now. Whew. think leans toward nationalism patriotism imo

Still glad you’re able get vaccinated though u get information? would chosen this?

She got AZ shot officia statent thr STIKO said give people older 60. would make difference? comes believing billshit one shot worse other, simply case. Say insurance? Let’s go! think we’ll see cases start drop soon-ish... Japan fell trap Sweden. Mysteriously survived first global wave unscathed

That's right, though. Sweden badly hit first wave, unlike Japan. Japan never even felt it. might thinking Czech republic. covid strong reaction second shot. reaction first randomly happened come subreddit today learnt wiping things mostly useless. Untill today still believed important wipe stuff. Though saw 1-2 posts this, still advice tv websites wiping stuff, washing hands. Shouldnt CDC body come like try make message widespread? Sounds like shady place get vaccinated. even ask ID appointment, name Colorado. state run clinic rough time second shot. Almost twelve hours splitting headache, nausea, now, low grade fever. Hope passes soon. got shot 24 hours ago “Brilliant” doesn’t equal “expert infectious disease.” I’m Florida talking about? There’s virus? Huh? mean pandemic? much theater. much cognitive dissonance. True, conservative. Though least admitted vaccinated people ""do"" things, also reduced stringent guidance schools. Incidentally stringent tourism-dependent countries updated policies that, example, parties comprised vaccinated adults kids vaccination age quarantine (Anguilla particular). 200 Million! Let’s go, that’s +50 Million 2 weeks. Nobody asking insurance true state. Insurance requirement state's site, thinking would change opened vaccinating everyone last week. quickly made appointment (every location appointment ones saw state's site) called hour ago confirm insurance. told another state it. said could denied getting vaccines one.

I never took SAT either never got good college. Instead went community college, state school. wouldn’t call successful would say I’m reasonably ok given job market. There’s ways succeeding life without going top tier university. 

It’s ethics admitting kids can’t well test university test you. It’s fact you’re see failure rates go drop rates increase turn. Use remind bot want check back year. You’ll find UC system marked drop increase time next year. seen data support vaccines. Additionally, notion general vaccine temporarily weakening immune system misconception. would pay full tuition competitive university take glorified University Phoenix classes home? agree sure.

Side note, I’m thanks jumping throat questions — afraid people would attack say things like ‘shut go get vaccine’ I’m glad that’s reply.

I’m fairly open getting vaccine, I’m anxious minded hypochondriac nervous it’ll me. work schedule insane, luckily home still can’t really take week think possibility would never able come least semi-successful vaccine pretty slim get go. tweak vaccines and/or add boosters lose effectiveness. couple reasons lockdowns though.

Also, flatten curve hospitals get overwhelmed people die could saved hospitals room them. know people want hear, I'm wearing mask almost 2 years there's miniscule chance kids bad reaction covid. cousin pretty serious immune disorder never even asked around her.

From looking around neighborhood since last year, parents concerned either, since always groups kids playing together unmasked outside. BC’s approach actually sounds much measured ON. guys didn’t reactively close tons businesses response seems much targeted, rational, calm. meaningful increase case counts ten days.  point all. We're simply hedonic evolution. People antsy open huge chunk population cannot receive vaccine yet. can't fling doors wide open prematurely.

Good news Dad, B1.1.7 kind men age. lot people covid think vaccine needed. case, think headline might push go get vaccine northern states seen bump cases recently reported lower numbers last week (Michigan included) They've giving 2 year olds vaccines years one cares new people scared. works everyone there's problem giving kids either. kids would getting vaccine sure. here. never ever ever shut prevent people able get sick. prevent overrun hospitals, longer realistically going happen. county somewhere state, could choose lockdown, applying state level point silly. care either gives fuck lol. Clearly regard lives. protect live life. Balanced? Good joke. Well several did. followers fucking morons supply outpaces domestic demand.

For instance, Saint Petersburg peak vaccine interest 16k people day got injection (roughly 50/50 split first second doses, 8k/8k), yesterday 7.8k got first dose 4.5k second dose despite number vaccination points increasing. One get vaccinated several shopping malls even require scheduled appointment, bring passport insurance policy, two (I think) sports venues offer vaccinations games. Also, there's demographic prioritization, matter 18 80. Thanks insight - saw cases plateaued lowering didn’t realize percentage positive also way down. Ironically boss. I’m wrong


You you.  I’ll still wear mask while. still breathe. Gtfo Right listen “right” experts ignore “wrong experts” zero research. convincing never said flu, /u/helembad talking saving many lives possible.

If want save many lives possible, need lock flu season wear masks. said yourself.. major costly. Almost certainly means insurance contract caveats. 

Considering huge multi billion dollar infrastructure spend, insurance likely a) cover portion investment b) exceptionally hard trigger. 

Don’t think Japan able recuperate $20 thousand million invested would tried already? Especially foreigners travelling Japan spend. source could read that? hadn’t heard before. I’m sure that’s vaccines work. I'm pretty happy US. I've got vaccine. went restaurant last night friends great time. someone gets Covid it, least choice. also warm south here.

Germany sounds like hellhole. appears - let’s hope.  Kids spread virus probably fastest good vaccinate quickly. went Walmart yesterday none young kids wearing masks... like parents think immune aren't. got vax, chills 4 days. fun. terrible. 

I think correct, living sometime, vaccine becomes moot 6 8 12 months. that's life.

People go get flu shot every year reason. virus causes flu mutates, science tries keep it, pump new vaccine every 12 months.

I personally dont believe ever ""go away"" much like flu never ""goes away."" Also, expectations go away, managed better form. 

Hell, technically, people still get bubonic plague, smae disease killed half Europe 1600s(?) sure numbers, killed ton people.  Lower natural immunity vs states makes much sense contributing factor.  think light far away, tbh. Assuming trials go fine (which likely), we're one mass vaccination push away fully normal months.

Antivax hysteria thing could disrupt it. groups equally helpful. Yeah. couple months everyone wants shot gotten shot reached immunity. going put life hold irresponsible antivax morons. world downvoted?!? considered blessing spend much time kids. agree, techniques Japan cancel Tokyo Olympics coronavirus?

Why question? course can!!! Still better people say stay locked bc vaccines absolute 0 cases per million 100% guarantee.  I'm 100% pro reopening everything. require masks government offices, grocery stores, gas stations another 4-6 weeks, but, beyond that, time people set risk tolerances. Businesses also set restrictions deem necessary, people choose whether patronize places. don’t think outdoor exercise ever restricted much. fishing exercise good outside vitamin d. Brazil India always horror. I'm going let countries dictate live life good ole USA. Also people scared shadows, TERR-I-FIED everything. second Moderna shot scheduled Monday. husband took work Tuesday take care twin 10 month olds case bad reaction. I'm also newly pregnant bit nervous getting fever reaction. suggestions? take Tylenol starting hours shot try keep fever bay? missing point. people covered dreadful scheme eligible get two doses yet, rather choosing to. United Kingdom pretty much highest rate vaccine acceptance world. options, yeah, it’s ok. nothing, context worldwide shortage vaccines, it’s good indeed. lot people country won’t die thanks it. major gives multi hour standardized tests given locations abnormal ones standard place education, weekends, substantial range topics differ ones selected major. never took SAT, (school used ACT) got 34 still inconvenient one difficult tests ever take throughout undergrad experience. one harder GMAT, absolutely next level.

so could avoided possibly prevent mental damage would great Meanwhile, UK becoming covid free mostly 1-dose despite schools opening early March)

Is nobody noticing US still struggling suppress cases death numbers despite massive rollout Pfizer Yes, wearing mask 2 hours. mean putting removing mask multiple times either. bacteria grow whether face pocket around neck top head.

If going out, putting removing mask. house long wear mask, firstly consider whether right must, bring spare mask wash hands putting on.

The reason wearing mask leaving house, even there's one about, touching mask without washing hands. Certainly pulling day counter intuitive. telling people vaccinated live life like covid exist. masking lock downs. lot people would sign vaccine media politicians saying It’s already happening apparently Hope you’re right Rare? get hospitalized due covid, prepared clots. standard procedure start blood thinners day one. friend got 3 blood clots hospital still thinners. Yep.

The US general done little mandatory vaccination, particularly little adults.

There times specific diseases way worse diseases. stop wearing mask then? I’m situation right family (aunt raised me, cousin, husband kids). live alone working site entire duration pandemic visited since February 2020. live city. 

We fully vaccinated now, trying set get together us May sometime. aunt cousin insisting would masked, socially distanced get together outdoors somewhere. ALSO FUCKING CRAZY. really want see them, also don’t want enable normalize behavior nothing ever going normal again. social animals, fear people seriously psychologically damaged pandemic. UK using AZ vaccine mostly effective Uk variant. remember White House spreader event? held outdoors bunch people still caught it. Losing shit India might quite point, damn, huge amount dry tinder think rooting flames stay small.
 
Im sure numbers off, think still want stay small possible every metric.  strongly prefer union system. education, job position, and# years working used determine wage. Simple. population 100,000,000 individuals thought (which roughly current vaccinated population US) 90% effective means 10 million people still catch spread disease

Not exactly true. 

*Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness interpreted proportionate reduction disease among vaccinated group. 90% indicates 90% reduction disease occurrence among vaccinated group, 90% reduction number cases would expect vaccinated.*

Unless 100 million would expected catch (not likely), correct say we'd still expect 10% entire population come COVID. turns difference baloney anyways AZ getting unfairly maligned.

In today's Oxford paper found 5 million chance AZ (suspected similar J&amp;J) vs 4 million Pfizer.... basis half million patients, say, TWO got brain clots.

The whole thing almost joke difference perception AZ others total complete sad joke. choice problem that. 
I personally waiting clinical trials done fda approval consider. 
And people infected - leadership failed us many ways that’s part hesitancy well problem getting flu shot every year. also problem getting yearly COVID shot needed. 

However, shot needs available anyone anytime. Like others said. Walk Walgreens whim work get it. 

But tie shot random metric X% getting vaccine imposing sort restrictions (dining capacity, concert capacity, family gathering capacity “recommendations “ mask mandates) don’t reach number, go fuck themselves. Yes herd immunity thing good means enough people take it, ignorant ones protected well. Like said before, took shot safety well safety others. didn’t blindly follow anything, research. Luckily majority people nation take shot move on. majority didn’t want shot, would screwed like couple months ago. think big reason topline number doses manufactured domestically. They're watching happening US, India, UK decided need need treat vaccine production like airplanes. Boeing vs Airbus stuff. also need democrat support dont 57% adults Mass least one shot. heck expected decrease daily case count percent positive numbers. Grumble Agreed. Yet, NYC even walking empty half streets vast majority wearing masks times. almost sign ""good"" and/or ""not Replican"". jobs either met requirements don't. There's different ways measure compensate right,

* [27% fully [56% received least one World Data (the data source used google search results) even know antibody levels required yet effective immunity I'm mistaken. would take grain salt. may well half even quarter anti-bodies get vaccines plenty effective. also know variants basically fall apart mild cold viruses. Birth control? would result less people getting covid shot?

""I'd get shot one deadly disease also get shot another deadly disease"" weird line reasoning Even 102 fever, still felt ""better"" knowing expected like Covid would actually dangerous. knew body job response vaccine. But, still sucked ass. achy swollen well :( don’t care herd immunity. never risk life help faceless group Right? insane states already pushing 70% adult population vaccinated. Irrelevant polio spread respiratorialy. Irrelevant polio spread respiratorialy. can't comment them, frank jokes, I've seen recently regarding microchip conspiracy- think governments concerned control us us healthy they've used advantage. 

In UK, government counted covid deaths death occurred within 28 days testing positive. boosting numbers they're creating fear people likely comply. 

Do think would fair count death covid vaccine death within 28 days receiving vaccine?

We still dont know long term effects jab us. 

In late 50s morning sickness pill named Thalidomide promoted women believed safe. became apparent actually causing children born disabilities. - ""best"" part available 7 years!?!
 
A similar scenario could happen jab UK government granting immunity legal prosecution ""vaccine"" developers, seems like they've prepared that. - we'ren't informed please read it. anyone else reading this, wish provide different viewpoint situation we're in. want back normal much rest but, eventually realise, never going go back ""normal"".

and happened second dose?

hope anybody help UK seen one strictest countries yet i’ve never heard anything masks outdoors here. Personally I’m inside something twenty minutes mask, relish opportunity step outside take real breath fresh air. 

If masks mandated outside i’d probably never leave house. like funny happens obesity rate half US. expanding statement general approach public health. true, focusing whether also effective personal level. push back attempts discourage positive messaging around vaccines attempt modify risky behavior. nothing free got email scheduled confirmed first vaccine dose Sunday. I’ll getting first dose Pfizer excited especially since I’ll fully vaccinated Florida vacation June. 

Things seem really rolling US now. signed Vaccine earlier week big city (Philadelphia). Herd immunity thing like viruses nervous could isolate. instead took away peoples rights work businesses walk around without masks go school playgrounds (oh except protest fine!) nervous. 
And yes community, (early on) people masks would top fixing masks touching products etc. 
so months looking numbers decided time go back normal. know like multiple 74+ year olds terrible health beat problem 

From never blindly follow someone telling know stores go respect rights longer give money stores denied family food service. 

I thankful friends family also like minded continued celebrate birthdays grandmom grandad kids went vacation lot parks/sight seeing. continue. 
If another pandemic hit research make decisions. within biden's first 100 days? Moderna working influenza vaccine uses mRNA technology surprised decide future combine vaccines. someone supportive government mask mandates, really don’t see problem letting go since vaccines light end tunnel. wearing masks continue aren’t won’t. Corporate businesses aren’t tossing mandates wind yet either probably keep place summer. change letter law. Mask wearing trends likely remain awhile longer. UK know vaccine we're going get get appointment, told get there, know actually gets injected turn up.

Although kind guess based vaccination centre is, pfizer tends given hospitals near big cities vaccination centres near big cities. pretty much lets face facts point. unless lock home rest life going get covid point. Damn Jim, you’ve got technicality. here. Looked everything gone within like 100miles me. Oh well, wait weeks. funny thing is, one shot M/P actually effective J&amp;J according newer studies. even want 1 shot, go get Moderna skip second shot lol

Disclaimer: doctor health advice Easy catch covid get vaccine  Senators jumped line. risk assessment problem run whether also eight times likely get COVID wait vaccine. Unfortunately, theres plenty people think they're going sit sideline get COVID everyone else gets vaccinated case count drops... perhaps middle path wait MRNA vaccine.

Though SUPER anecdotal, literally taking care male patient received Pfizer vaccine 2 days ago sinus thrombus. highly suspect much common much benign previously known, absent data prove stronger case. took doses travel can't even. Australia can't travel next years like what's point going side effects I'm saying expect lot, kind apathetic flu shot young adult. I'd get years not. 100% get covid booster. I'm sure rate somewhat better, even scientifically ideal levels time write comment people involved scam going arrested, right?

No. Crematoriums reporting deaths city state officials. Ah basically like outdoor 'mandates' here. guess they're probably waiting 'expire' renew it.

MIS-C rare, also used scare tactic day keep vaccinated people leaving house kids. can't ways - either MIS-C scourge children really rare concern terms vaccine trials.  yet unknown circumstances antibodies created spike protein end targeting ACE2 receptors, end aiding future strain COVID causing severe symptoms? also take consideration viruses forced mutate quickly evade vaccines. also look failed track record decade Moderna’a mRNA products. would getting Pfizer easier / relieving her? People need stop talking AZ like 5ml poison lmao

Is liked? Well chancellor since 2005 lot people liked long time. date variant evaded vaccines natural immunity completely. Oxford vaccine got wrecked South African variant hold well. Even J&amp;J. novavax think it’s called coming year too. Another highly effective vaccine arsenal. 

And also variants still get hit cell memory naturally infected. means likely body still recognize time produce antibodies fight off. well OG strains well enough tell. It’s like you’re fucked you’ll get reinfected guaranteed. likelihood reinfection. even scary variants going getting antibodies recognize infected reinfected. 

Our vaccines natural immunity outpacing mutation rate. Also booster shots coming early September. Don’t despair. Pandemics always end. Perhaps caution isn’t abundance all? talking legally enforceable rules ""recommendations""? public health recommendations need take vaccination status account one thing I'm glad US' CDC finally done. Get stuff together, Canada, start listening science. problem. tags useful filter relevant info, otherwise wouldn’t mentioned it. Article refers additional/earlier shipment Pfizer/BioNTech. 5 Mio. projected June. Still, massive boost massiv boost expected 2.5 Mio. week 3.4 Mio. doses approximately two weeks time, compared &lt; 1.5 previous weeks. good news, particular new info afaik. non essential travel brazil needs stopped immediately. Instead tracking variants allowing vaccine exports countries variants ACTUALLY CONTROL start vaccinating. taken sick day vacation well decade.  Poverty usa sucks. think sentiment increasing past years—and couldn’t rising price college? hope pandemic made families stop think kids’ professional choices.

College isn’t everyone, like trades military aren’t everyone. kids need know options make informed choice. means high schools need stop stressing college else. Also 300k Janssen vaccines coming 2 weeks doctor now? interesting see happen run 60+ arms vaccinate. 

I would certainly one AZ left :) Terrible misinformation  in! +3.97M doses reported administered total yesterday! Steady two prior Fridays (3.98 4/2, 3.96 4/9). Overall great day head toward 100% states universal eligibility 16 over, Monday. currently crying Canada aha.. 2b recoup 23b invested. really good thing government deal with. Think fail contain pandemic Japan fell trap Sweden. Mysteriously survived first global wave unscathed, assumed must something exceptional country, completely let guard result. 

Same thing probably happen countries changed next pandemic, next, next... charge price tell people give 50% off. Huh, graph shows plateau last two weeks, last week looking worse week re: number new cases No. bc trust people /s thankful parents enroll children trials. help save lives thousands children. hope something done provide safe Covid immunizations infants young 6 months old. understand infants far likely die Covid infections children. Considering shot done publicly, doubt it. Also, bother getting shot fake vaccine? pretend get shot lie it? blood disease whose means attack respiratory. Pfizer making though, 4M doses delivered May 2M June already scheduled. accurate. like course mislead statistics. 

The best measurements still 90%-95% effective, still awesome. vaccines free everyone living U.S., regardless immigration health insurance status.

Does anyone know kind ID need show get vaccine US-issued form ID? Passport? 114 269 0-4 17. really doesn’t matter number. It’s negligible preventable. means, everyone keep downvoting. Shitty news sucks, downvoting isn’t going change it. Well apparently difference booster, exact vaccine again. knows you’ll feel same. Still 3 months games. Could donate half hour's worth vaccine dose production US, EU India ensure anyone going anywhere near Olympics ground vaccinated.

Well sucks People saying - they're right - ramped production N95s population level instead health care worker level gotten everyone 30 masks month start, could killed thing 3 months. 

This also points importance HEPA filtration buildings, especially schools. problem retrofitting HVAC. problem rolling HEPA machine back every classroom, running duct front, giving teacher megaphone industrial grade ones pretty loud. Except fairly misleading number. 

Example, friend mine became ""fully vaccinated"" two days ago. He's counted number someone fully vaccinated get COVID it.

Which makes sense. Lets assume got COVID second considered ""fully vaccinated."" Well, would still count someone protected getting COVID, two days long enough symptoms show, get tested, result counted. again, that's got infected first moment.  

Obviously, short time scales looking allowed lot people get COVID even vaccine nothing. people fully vaccinated long, due time takes become fully vaccinated daily vaccination numbers higher months ago. 

And that's even taking account stuff like demographics people got early vaccines different general population, etc. 

In short, better indicators efficacy vaccines trials plus big studies done places like UK Israel. show something like 90%-95% effective, really, really great! per day? assumed case, that's really badass! Seriously actions speak louder words, position world leader like dealing covid would much easier/relieving get Pfizer, got AZ boost confidence.

Open actual (linked cidrap article) see ""Study finds 12% US children COVID-19 hospitalized"" *incredibly* misleading, know cidrap thought OK phrase way article.

In words, among children inpatient emergency department encounters, 12% hospitalized covid-19. *not* ""Study finds 12% US children COVID-19 hospitalized,"" need take word it, since look article yourself.

As final note, saying need worry children getting sick. *only* thing saying headline misleading. J&amp;J producing far fewest amount vaccines. people prefer wait vaccine currently unavailable two currently available choice made. first world problem rest world would love have. Hence word mostly Seeing article Times like frankly annoying. public messaging around COVID centered around social distancing, masking wearing people “stay fuck home.”

However, elements straight common sense - take vitamin D, exercise, eat well - talked mainstream circles. told people also important elements prevention year ago, people would call conspiracy theorist. vaccination situation there? public health agency [mired political controversy Supreme Court ruling seemed upend everything left agency mostly toothless, resulting resignation top official. GOP power done, apparently, interest virus. public health agency legal power issue directives, courts sided GOP, making essentially losing battle.

Also compare like risks, dying getting blood clot. would compare blood clot getting severe covid risk young people much much 1 million. really reasonable ask young healthy person take small risk blood clot J&amp;J vaccine could simply wait weeks take Pfizer Moderna instead?

It's still choice though, could tell people small risk allow choice. People naturally self select feel risk covid higher. 

Everyone still free wait mRNA vaccines would like to. 

Regardless, think agree older people benefits pause seem significantly smaller costs age bracket. Agreed. think another company solve problem good idea reach out. Better nothing solution. actually read article, study based? Testing twice extremely common. Speed component volume another. labs X number machines run samples. running average 5% positivity, know 300 batches samples (assuming 3 1) running you’ll see 15 need run twice. still affordable you’ve given negative results extra 200 patients. positives get double check. banned point. could get VOC traveller, country. global spread, isolating countries incredibly minor chance carrying putting quarantine suffice, together testing, suffice. would take get African states list - especially ones report use high-quality genome sequencing cases - list? almost unattainable zero COVID?

The impact B1.351 VOC is, stage, control South Africa least (without vaccine rollout, that). deadly variant already circulating UK. may break vaccinated people, would still avoid severe illness, hospitalizations death.

Makes much sense mask mandates fully vaccinated people.  shit supposed bad? hope communication things. anti mask, anti science, restaurant owner, gym owner lobby much louder smart, considerate, educated person lobby. louder are. curious hope someone knowledgeable help out. keep seeing folks use FL TX examples states removing mask mandate lead spikes. possible severe numbers early pandemic means lot citizens already immunity infections? would immunity infection play role non-mask mandate, good numbers? 10, stupid Pretty sure nobody America stopped hanging buds first place. I've seen, everything back normal since always except months 2020. one top rated public school districts state recently announced plan offer learn home option permanently. So, words, even pandemic “completely over,” they’ll continue offer zoom classes option whoever wants opt that.

This also higher income district, I’ve heard, first went hybrid offer in-person remote learning, families opted remote. even re-surveyed everyone 6 months later, see would come back in-person, still roughly half opted remote.

I’m starting wonder districts going look something similar. helps, schools open since August issues besides needing quarantine due contract tracing. Barely cases tied school, outside school. get vaccinated yet? Well, except lot people treating politics like religion holding back progress.

I agree things US 10x better Brazil, losing battle keep way. good social policy incentivizes people get vaccine also puts protein diet, goals China citizens. Less 12 million normally expected. understand. However personally seen; guy travels state work party super spreader event. Comes home goes back work. Developes virus. work (a restaurant) shuts down. people work. kids stay home quarantined. daycare room, class room, bus shut kids must stay home quarantined. parents lose work time pay stay home take care them. ONE dude let guard down. 

It's common sense OPINION let guard apparently still raging.

Well, last train full, like complete normal day. police came, ask anyone control anything. even one unfriendly lady wearing mask ""reprimended"" her. fine, anything. didnt wear Mask full 15-20 min train took arrive.

I know local problem general, I've seen tons people giving shit anyone (with authority) anything. vaccination rate seems slowing down. least rural county, can’t fill vaccination appointments. don’t care DeWine says... mask mandate followed extent claims. Go rural county count mask usage, it’s good.

At one point optimistic Ohio would reach goals restrictions lifted Memorial Day. Hell, thought early May. Now, I’m sure. Maybe sometime June.

Excuse wrong - risk vaccine related clot even take account may even get covid?

In words - even chance catching covid average person - still risk taking vaccine? way look maybe makes seem reasonable that, point, know many cases blood clots actually be. 6 reported (I read 7th yesterday, man). J&amp;J shots US given past weeks. Basically first big wave vaccinations 7 side effects including one death. ever risks may ok. find lot more, might different story. unfortunately pause let play out.

With AstraZeneca think found total 79 cases blood clots look similar two. makes think J&amp;J blood clots. still rare, 4 million, 4x they've found J&amp;J.

It also true likely get blood clot covid vaccine. risk highly skewed certain population, primarily elderly people certain conditions. could say still vaccinated risk much less. 

But younger healthy people, risks getting sick covid also lot lower. some, 1 million, J&amp;J blood clots. little less cut dry. decision countries made give AZ vaccine older people vulnerable. may eventually happens US.

It frustrating hoping J&amp;J vaccine going put nail covid coffin thinking think ""pausing"" little bit makes sense. Vaccines social distancing really work. wonderful Ohhhhh, dumbass even consider boosters new variants. Yeah, “purple.” happening everywhere attaching local article reputed newspaper claiming April actual death count 200 officially shown 20[death count yet, read responses people app seem think soon get go holiday Eh.. outbreaks outdoor events since beginning, even considered super spreader events.. don’t know “no outdoor spread” mindset came from.. many people repeat point though. way 20% America anti-vaxx, like hardcore anti-vaxx, vaccinate kids polio mumps, vaccines product Satan/Big-Pharma.

I think surprised many people place faith government bureaucracy, full approval FDA comfort. motorcycle helmets. (Seatbelts required 18, least. still: Live free die, baby!) think intended coney thr mentality varying level extremes. think anyone brain agree poverty Brazil multiple factors extreme cutthroat United States. Eugh, joke got old year ago It’s still news. explain us happened Australia? Unless live highly vaccinated country, aggressive variants making numbers worst ever seen. 

And since confirmed case counts driven heavily USA UK testing manages get tested India, Brazil Turkey, degree real number multiple confirmed also surely largest ever. Im remembering last football season days game one team bunch positives opponents came basically unscathed. kind close contact people without infecting long outdoors also think outdoor masking requirements kinda redundant US waiting turn get vaccinated, turn. Make appointment Monday (everyone age eligible then).

The vaccine free. Even insurance. Even undocumented. free. everyone eligible. FREE.

Tell family friends vaccinated. turn now.

If need help booking finding appointment, reply someone help you. certain (large) groups people, risk dying COVID small, made even smaller one takes basic precautions. looks like lot people equate vaccine certainty infected, extrapolate certainty death, without considering much greater inverse possibility. thing, different shapes say they're taking pandemic seriously they're vaccinated? Getting vaccine single important piece mitigation exists. They're taking plenty seriously, worried theater.

Are least paying babysitting? not, lol. ""Hey know vaccinated continue put life hold convenient us."" got Pfizer doses Feb/March know NSAID issue vaccines unfortunately taking prescription strength Naproxen another medical issue shots. chances vaccine ""take""? wanting find worked ordered T-Cell test.

Thats stupid comparison plenty scientists disagree you. use Google. It’s tragic people died what’s alternative? never ended successful vaccine current ones longer effective...then what? Common sense says eventually reopen economy long covid world, infect community again. lockdowns effective European countries fourth round year later? we’re discussing safety vaccine, think you’re making logical mistake here. person died blood clot happened Australia irrelevant. people got vaccine, many complications? 222 34 million recipients EU UK, giving rate 1 100,000. many died Covid area? 

If we’re discussing “safest” decision Australia *at moment* covid’s prevalence Australia relevant. Unless consider facts, 910 people died Covid, locked isolated. 

910 dead Covid, 1 person died vaccine complication, can’t keep Australia locked forever. 

I’ll take vaccine, already reason. One thing noticed, comes China made vaccines seem really inconsistent. Vaccinations higher higher lockdown months yet people get sick die.

I'm sure move this. Usually use VPN stream coverage countries. BBC UK CBC Canada great job minimal ads avoid many “feel good stories”. actually air live events, too. probably take time learn country, well rest world. good place start.   discussing day someone I've dwelling it: 2nd dose (Pfizer, Moderna, AZ) temporarily lower efficacy someone first shot? think does, said gives short-term reduction body 'fights' 2nd dose (i.e. side effects) body stronger before. papers either way it? so, approaches working same? deaths per capita perspective? Concerts large events require people vaccinated later year next. gets healthy younger people get it. Open 12-15 then. think idea would surprising someone test positive given size event. Also connotation kind “duh” moment people attending large events (20+ ppl) time, result expected. really get it.

In public transport system play message every 3 minutes asking people wear masks cover noses people still run around face penises.

It feel strange, US bad position months ago, strange drastically different summer going look US compared Europe. dad friend air filtration ""explained masks work"", hear anything different. That's another thing makes difficult, love dad mom shared lot views things.

At time feel like robbed lot last year, count afraid covid. birthday January go told feel safe eating restaurants yet. I'm type take risks, wish one time... one time...

Edit: Sorry, appreciate advice offer. intend stay viewing, immediate family part. thing happened me. allowed vote last election. pandemic actually dream come true introverted scolds. Changing life style little super great weapon shame people with, slipping away upping ante saying lockdowns forever. 5,800 cases 77 million people, asymptomatic mild? That's something worry all. actually excellent news demonstrates vaccines working well. Yay! Glad able get pause. kids still spread germs course, one infected COVID infected prior! course, one infected COVID fully vaccinated! key priorly infected getting vaccine significantly reduces impact COVID. immune system responds faster clears virus quicker. Buried article quote:

""Those got COVID “had universally good outcomes,” Letizia said, majority didn’t even know infected, re-infected, told test results.""

The headline read:

Prior infected Marines universally good outcomes. heard doctors already taking nsaids daily health issues shouldn’t stop vaccine. Ride appointment. CT roll vaccines 1a: medical workers/elderly. 1b. 65 older. 1c. rest population 18. Finding open slot vaccine proximity difficult. compounded thousands cancellations due jannsen vaccine ""pause"". 2 people get fatally sick denied vaccine cdc logical let jannsen vials sit pharmacys press start..

..  Covid-99 when? NBC doesn’t even air opening closing ceremonies live time inconvenient. dumb b.s.

Rio exception Rio 1-2 hours ahead New York time. Seriously, genuine unsung heroes here. vaccine approved emergency use, now, pandemic. 

There people can't get vaccinated severe allergies medical treatment. heart goes folks would feel sorry got sick.

As stated originally, I'm personal responsibility. tell today benefits vaccines outweigh risks huge margin. still get one that's sympathy get sick.  Lol dude one gives fuck. Wear masks rest life, don’t try force others to. think pretty straightforward answer. State mandate efficacy mask efficacy different topics. readily apparent mandates dont alter compliance enough differentiate data. Mask usage US continues similar frequncies without statewide mandates. frustrating. Europe know many months I'll wait loved ones get vaccined, even know fair complain places things lot worse. Reading kind things gets nerves going happen eventually. know people underwent cancer treatment literally went flu season. cousins son going chemo covid oncologist Seattle Children's told family covid anything cancer kids. They've less hospitalized covid stopped flu. whole family caught covid son little immune system tested positive asymptomatic. 

How long think vaccinated masks there's next chance passing virus on? Yep. lesson -- hope J&amp;J vaccine suffer fate. seen trial data all. still spread corona even get vaccine looks occur mRNA vaccines well. article: study also suggested four cases CVT likely occur one million people vaccinated either Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech jab. trial zero restrictions NSAID use vaccine effective. doctor correct - big deal. that. SAT-less admissions process whole thing opened doors colleges perform extreme affirmative action. I’m sure you’ve heard year’s freshman University California system round diverse class history system. 

This large part stopped using test scores determine they’d accept. Anecdotally heard two straight seniors, white boy Asian/white girl tons extracurriculars looked like shoe ins, least B tier schools. applied many top schools like Cal UCLA also B tiers one safety school each. denied every decent school. One got UC Merced, laughing stock UC system got international school. Anecdotes aren’t facts kids destined decent schools pandemic. 

The upshot UC system’s perspective they’ve able shove people largely would ignored before. seen great win black Latino students aren’t prepared real college classes. admissions based GPAs, you’re going see kids top class underperforming South Central LA schools means nothing, get thrown classes like Trigonometry business in. 


[NPR’s American Life piece try spin story hard ensure looks like amazing opportunity kids color, even editorializing believe it’s apparent difficult messed situation whole thing is. flip side there's much reason suspect danger, taking one small risk offset another small risk, i.e.: getting sick covid.  Never experience, try things back “normal”.  Oh sure, didn’t mean judgment, much different experiences be. low risk haven’t eaten indoors restaurant year friends family think I’m nuts. can't get hurt someone driving recklessly right next you? I'd love see car's crash test rating. live Mass even know outdoor mask mandate....I definitely wearing mask outside. I've seen people wearing outside though, plenty wearing well. There’s big difference choosing approved vaccines one paused look closely data patient side effects make sure bigger reason concern. 

We’ll get rid FDA let pharmaceutical companies tell us everything fine. That’s worked well past. People power need give metrics pandemic ""under control"". worry forever. though? isn’t notable. NEWS (Notable Events Weather Sports) really? know 1 dose provides pretty good protection. think places hit herd immunity. live Alabama, masks slowly going away month half, mandate officially expired quietly 2 weeks ago. restaurants packed, non-chain restaurant staff even wear masks, depending grocery store might 50-50 masking point. better worse, things getting back 2019 normal here.  despite that, numbers back early April 2020 levels shit started. think Alabama might nearly 50% infection levels, combine vaccinated people think everyone sort protection point. assume mean contracts place line booster shots delivered timely fashion. Russia selling countries barely vaccinating population? That's unusual... heard Japan says can't it, IOC make Japan responsible demand compensation. IOC decides cancel olympics Japan compensated.

So sides can't really back one back pay up. Good idea. way people talk, almost forgotten bars crucial sacred lifeblood civilization  I'd say non-Covid times. agree decisions, get paid babysitter. mean I’m not. I’m saying wrote isn’t correct. isn’t 0.01% percent people got infected didn’t encounter virus often enough vaccinated. 

Only 0.01% got virus vaccination rate often people vaccinated would get it. close number found research trials. found vaccine 99.99 % effective way defining word effective. 

But way scientists defined effective different, definition 95% effective. 

But way using word effective, 0.01% chance getting Covid vaccinated regardless many people Covid encounter.

Basically, using word effective way used colloquially. used scientifically, least specific case. fair ""this news clickbait nonsense"" unfortunately good prior. Got second shot Moderna today. wife also got first shot. big load protected stupid virus. herd immunity contributions natural infections somehow apply arguably fittest group non-civilians United States? title article implying?  Team work makes dream work seen popular studies Pfizer none mention this. tested see. new tech somehow completely perfect? point also look mentioned, including vaccination effort 1976 swine flu, problems caught till year later much damage already done. vaccines pulled market. want regard getting vaccinated, people need make decisions guilted shamed them.  Nah. 258 covid deaths 18 total us according cdc. Less 200 deaths high school Obviously? Get exercise, sunshine (vitamin d). exhausted morbidly obese. Social distancing masks help getting it, steps help getting severe case do. 

But guess welcome counterpoint ""Everyone stay locked homes"" messaging earlier. recall various measures passed scientifically illiterate governors (Whitmer) trying limit outdoor activities (like fishing) hope here. Last two times end well, knows. delay another year, end holding Olympics year, every four years, like used do?!  Wynn nice it’s caesars recall, side planet. guess make sense pay ads events everyone's asleep, wait till timezones awake Doesn’t seem like great idea big chunk population walking around swapping germs. kids low risk all. There’s also issue serving reservoir keep covid circulating raising everyone’s risk. true South Africa. Travel bans won’t stop spread either it’s nearly damaging current data insofar international surges suggest.

Hence, again, consistency? would shortsighted assume B1.351 cases South African origin begin with. Literally parts earth people carrying particular variant. countries given benefit doubt but, stage, SA, possible one transparent boot, not. 

The info freely available online. Feel free check out. 10 percent 189 recruits COVID-19 antibodies re-infected. 48 percent — 1,079 — 2,247 Marine recruits study previously infected COVID-19 got COVID

It's better result study without spun pretzel. I'm current headline confuses people like you. prevent wanting to. disagree hard argue shutting hiking trails, beaches, parks right move given much influence physical activity population level. hospital ICUs fill time flu season Agreed. There’s also reason difficult arrange shots even arrive country. We’re talking maybe 15k people excluding support staff. one ones bypassing. work US. deemed essential (but essential providing family) quarantine upon coming home. follow quarantine rules doses Pfizer. think quarantine rules Canada amended show proof vaccination negative test. However selfish see family. Basically can't come home family unless 3 weeks jobs hard spouse 4 year old. Even though believe things different follow 14 day quarantine strictly.

I drive 5 hours Great Falls, Montana fly need go. fly back Great falls drive across avoid spending $3,000 quarantine 3 nights hotel connected airport. Tremendous news around. Canada able finish second doses mid July. feeling matter number preceeds word deaths sentence, would shout same. think would terrible, got card I'll 80% immunity either way, curious cuz kind weird scenario. would suspect cause syringe failures like common. 

I'd also say lack noticeable side effects far rare. That's like amount kids drown 2-3 months given year see government mandating swimming lessons every child forcing pool owners drain pools. mostly due high vaccine hesitancy US compared high vaccine uptake UK.

My point absolutely unchanged whether 10% reinfection 20%: actual findings can't represented headline people like read sometimes. guess I'm harsh lady. Like said reply seemed genuinely uncertain happened tried gloss small part distrustful. Yeah - sometimes find wondering disparity, remember... Since might survive getting virus, course I'm going hyper-aware safe compared majority know they'll fine.

Others either virus totally fine fully vaccinated probably much worry about, either. vaccinated people probably think, ""Ok - part - got vaccinated, helps everyone -- basically true""

He's implying dumb shit suspicious buy food supermarket ban fun stuff lol.
But fact matter 1) likely far safer spend 20 minutes masked kinda distanced big store spending extended periods time maskless friends 2) stocking food etc. necessity opposed leisure activities.

No, many vaccines entirely inactivated, including sinovac covid vaccine. Skeptism towards new technologies pessimistic thinking. think politicians really expect vaccine good available soon last summer. Ive curious long term aspect, anyone insight? 

if blood clots immediate concern following receiving j&amp;j az vaccination, also concern later on? Say 3 months later, 3 years later, 30 years later? 

I know there’s “track record” exact vaccines compare, evidence reasonable likely concern? schools absolutely expensive even so. Thats lot hookers blow. BioNtech simply fantastic. exceedingly small risk. CDC found that, surface \*is\* contaminated COVID-19, odds getting way still 1 10,000.

And yet, still set things aside 2-3 days. I'll stop vaccinated fully, messaging beginning really hard shake. source that?  blood oxygen levels depleting badly diseased lungs are. show something like 90%-95% effective, really, really great!

They also show near 100% effectiveness preventing severe illness death, so, even became infected fully vaccinated, chances hospitalized dying near zero -- true even severe, serious preexisting conditions and/or advanced age. 

These vaccines remarkable. lines stretched outside every pharmacy country get one beyond me.

The chance great enough mandated enough data show vaccinated people still actually transmit infections people. idea that's tossed around treated like scientific fact, yes, actual data? Seems scarce. Something Americans (and non-Americans too) *got* remember whenever governor implements new restrictions, *their own* fault careful *necessitates* restrictions first place. person replying implied 70% people vaccinated wasn’t enough stop using masks.

People health conditions immune system disorders may protected vaccines, everyone get vaccinated. now? feel like got wrong shot smh really depends metric looking actually. Yes AZ less effective BioNTech/Pfizer preventing symptoms. difference effectiveness preventing hospitalization though, example.
So difference AZ BNT/P actually get exposed COVID AZ shot might get cold symptoms week, would avoided BNT/P shot. 
So want stop pandemic, really doesn’t make much sense use AZ.
Now AZ J&amp;J apparently come marginal risk blood cloths young people, Germany gives people age 60+. waste doses, makes sense vaccinate basically everyone age group AZ anyone think microchip thing red herring dismiss legitimate concerns educated citizens might have? easy lump everyone conspiracy theory anti vaxx group shame belittle compliance? couple weeks supply perspective. Jury still comes demand perspective agree. Masks way protect herd. makes sense lift everyone wants vaccine get vaccine. Absolutely, still risk viral transmission vaccination case numbers get low mask guidance stay place makes sense peel (when community transmission low neglible) believe scientific considers parts country never get vaccinated feelings. 

I fully agree, get vaccine y'all. Thank u ur right insider knowledge makes nervous abt inviting specific friend. bc actively taking care covid pts still anxious abt seeing neone ohtside work/fiance even fully vaxxed w ppe. tough decision :( got that, asking regards well beyond weeks, thanks though- anyone link video something would useful share someone hesitant get vaccine? I'm pretty sure they'd convinced knew safe rigorously tested, saying things like ""we know long term effects"" want wait. try explain things think would much less effective video 

Please share know one! Sounds like like call ""anxiety brain"". people times think knot something terrible happened even though everything fine. 

I done many times. kiddo already gets vaccines yearly flu shot. doesn’t feel different trials approved. countries Asia contained done discipline. That's benefit collective societies individualistic ones. Unfortunately that's hard maintain long term 10s 1000s deaths makes people lazy getting vaccine out.

Source: I'm South Korea. lockdowns ridiculously high levels self-sacrifice. Great, learn trade earn 100k year like me. Trades absolutely slammed since started, wasn’t like weren’t busy before. think they’ll elect leave people unvaccinated longer period cancel olympics. seem pretty poised take fight finish. ...it gets us faster enough people enroll trials, trials take longer, vaccine takes longer get cleared kids.

I also think really understood post. talking small risks coronavirus ""your"" kids vs small risks vaccines that's consideration parents. isn't. Yup! Florida got much crap last year keeping beaches open finally acknowledge right move. beach happy place year can't imagine right outside beach taken away me. 

""The governor said important people outlets getting exercise, sunshine fresh Mine 45K (US) Denmark one mega trial study! Honestly least give public option 2nd AZ shot let patients assume risk. don’t like going work. aren’t allowed cup tea meeting, wash hands sterilise desks, don’t need wear masks open windows.

They obsessed performance basic science. ""Oh, no! go again!""

(George Harold *Captain Underpants*) Found Jho Low’s account. Within weeks. think schools require masks students vaccinated?

If community transmission still high, hope not, may necessary. High-risk kids also option continuing wear KN95 N95 masks school kids encouraged continue washing hands engage hygienic habits often possible.

Pfizer recently asked emergency permission start vaccinating 12-15 year-olds questions may even necessary time fall semester begins. mean... understand point agree. Online able connect peers professors well in-person difficult. ultimately, attend university degree move employment. university supposed pause pandemic digital technology allows function (albeit, shittier lol)? 

I saying dont understand people set back lives can't study groups parties. own. really matter known Pfizer BioNtech? Neither could without other. dick measuring contest, pandemic. BioNtech brought expertise mRNA Pfizer brought logistics (part of) capital. suspect people shorten Pfizer known quicker tongue. Given variant already spread far wide, I'm sure would help matters.  Oh, yeah, makes sense. Yep ""natural"" folks thought needed eat healthy would fine. 

They still nuts.  going happen - countries resources would need done truly keep variants out, even best performing ones see leaks. never convince US (or many many others) set something like Australia's system, even did, happens inevitable leak? shut things US again? right back wanting close country herd immunity potential someday variant escapes vaccines. Thats complete strawman. point things good individuals solution systemic issue like covid. fact large chunk population going eat healthy, exercise, get sunlight issues death hospitalization don’t go away subset population might healthy. Nobody ever really said things wouldn’t make less susceptible. We’ve know early comorbidities like obesity make covid severe. knowing isn’t actually going change health conditions average person. People challenged conspiracy nuts would say dumb shit like reopen people healthy that’s actually real solution. example strawman tactic? Memorial Day. much joy! 🇺🇸 Remember, protect mustache need wear chin diaper mouth nose. best option would require athletes vaccinated hold without spectators. However, would big financial hit. I'd feel better holding limited capacity spectators least 50-60% population vaccinated. Holding full capacity spectators 1% population vaccinated insane. everyone's wishes

I think understand: bribes already paid. IOC already cashed checks, yachts houses already bought.

You can't turn around overnight. symptomatic Yeah, insane 48% previously uninfected got infected Boot Camp, although makes sense think conditions they're living time.  course, demographic largely able ""shake off,"" good thing. Sorry hear that! want hear, doubt. country vaccine get, doing? get variants escape current vaccines, yes, could see needing frequent boosters years. happened yet, hopefully won't. 

Not sure mean stamp - going anywhere, prevalence definitely decrease. words AstraZeneca vaccine need removed title people vaccines. agree principal, *sigh*. know people impatient, know takes time kick right? know still groups recieved yet? Half population even approved yet (young adults children). I'll personally wearing mask kids vaccinated actually care people. Nobody likes dick noser! Guys close able lick doorknobs almost taste it!  fuck common sense. fitting N95 hard

Yes is. can't wear eat drink. wears home? top that, get people continually comply this. 

Vaccines continue provide protection even get infected immune system already primed fight. mask cannot that. tell week-by-week trends chart goes back year 7-day averages, eyesight clearly fuck lot better mine.

Huh... chart 7-day averages. Look bottom checkbox graph.

Guess eyesight CLEARLY 'fuck lot better' yours. LOL. Lol Ominous I'm one them. plan returning fall, since school plans person classes sufficient vaccinations. see local herd immunity likely outcome then. people afford take time sorts reasons, afraid so. position going waste year time shit personal home situation would desperately struggle get bare minimum classes overall experience. knew even got nothing productive done time going worse going pivotal year college hands experience speak of. early guidance (which universal 6 feet comes from) much opposite - aerosol transmission, travels droplets. Airborne spread really pay attention 6 foot radius, type indoor air movement involved. I’ve wondering thing. Here’s conclusion I’ve come to. 

First all, can’t rely numbers today. Immunity kicks 2-3 weeks first dose. look number people given first dose 2-3 weeks ago get real numbers. 

Secondly, remember many states used age banding vaccine eligibility. vaccinated 2-3 weeks ago likely older. 

This significant two reasons. First, vaccines slightly less effective elderly populations. Second, allows us look age related data see surge happening. 

Let’s look Vermont. Vermont high vaccine uptake strict age banding system. open essential workers except teachers medical workers, offered people 65 opportunity vaccinated. So, unlike states variety ages vaccinated early, actually see age banding work Vermont. 

Take look Vermont’s weekly Covid update: go page 33, you’ll see vaccine work. data shows pandemic, age bands approximately equally impacted approximately time. 

As mentioned, Vermont strict age banding (with minor exceptions). Here’s calendar dates Vermonters eligible make appointment (vaccines often followed several weeks appointment made):

Thursday, March 25: 60 older
Monday, March 29: 50 older
Monday, April 5: 40 older
Monday, April 12: 30 older
Monday, April 19: 16 older

I unable find exact dates 65+, 70+, 75+, believe two week window group, high risk conditions also point. 

What’s useful data know Vermonters 60 older, earliest saw first dose around April 1. means saw first benefit immunity around April 14th. 

So go back chart linked above, see real time strategy playing out. third surge hits, age groups go up—except 70+ range. Furthermore, see one population surging hard right now—the 20-29 range, become eligible make appointments week, likely won’t see first dose least week more. age band driving numbers right now.

To quote rate COVID-19 among 70+ nearly three times less March 2021 December 2020. rate among 20- 39-year-olds age 19 see positive impacts vaccination efforts age groups opportunity get vaccinated. Approximately 90% Vermonters 70+ received least one dose vaccine.

That really significant: rate COVID population likely see least benefit vaccine nearly 3 times less third surge vs. second one. 

In short, surge seeing driven combination increased disease younger populations time receive vaccine reach 14-21 day immunity point along vaccine hesitancy depressing uptake. Nah dude fuck that. None issues US school system fixed virtual school. It’s shit students. fall reason kids normal school. don’t care there’s vaccine kids 12. that...because everyone shipped N95's China mass beginning, none ""shortage"" that's US Gov (at least case) decided put measures block private citizens buying them. 

This easy say rose-tinted glasses either blocked exportation pissed China allowed try mitigate transmission got (because remember, giving us details - went gave us despite others theorizing case comes diplomacy amongst nations, trust otherwise risk fallout). likely: *and* spouse *and* friends happen share magical DNA makes covid-proof? lucky? people scared ones send kids happily school winter without even getting flu vaccine. don’t buy rationality concerns. Oh moral argument. tiresome one. 

The vast majority cases spread via essential work spread household members, poorer packed housing worse is, usually (see: Los Angeles). School children tested unless spent 15 consecutive minutes eating bloody flesh dead child tested positive within last 5 minutes death Well apparently girlfriend one “breakthrough cases”. got 2nd shot back late February tested positive Wednesday going get test trip supposed go on. I’ve told quarantine 20 days occupational health workplace (I’m essential employee)...ugh think realize dumb sound. sure TX best example. That's kind misrepresentation pandemic response.  Maybe rural Texas nobody ever gave shit, seemed like Florida ""pretend exist"" regard government response correct. seven day average hovering around 7,600 new cases since 4/9. worldometer graphs heavily depend platform view in. look mobile phone look like plateau all. desktop looks like plateau. 

Doesn't mean continue rise past week none small rise cases. interesting see happens next week. someone share story suggesting 50% efficient days ago?



Depends definition results Coronavac Brazil shown efficiency 50 percent preventing symptomatic Coronavac vaccine 67 percent effective preventing symptomatic Covid-19 80 percent preventing death, according real-life results unveiled Friday Chile's inoculation campaign. think big thing didn’t know anything could limit spread theory. Like conceivably could infectious wouldn’t see anything slow growth. time opened realized could things open spread completely getting control seem limiting factors spread even things open way know try wrong consequences could disastrous like collapse healthcare system. It’s volunteer get paid Vaccines provide real world 90% protection severe disease death vs unvaccinated. Masks provide same. would absurd think somehow masks less effective death getting infected first place.

Properly fitting N95 hard. hardest part would getting everyone shave regularly. protection factor, 70% compliance would needed like vaccines, bonus school age kids could wear one too, unlike vaccines. That's 4 months MAXIMUM. Shorter supply, will. No... go kids get vaccinated, looks fall. Thanks. know least actual medical toll high. worse places be.

Assuming Japan username, Japan also reasonably stoic know deeper issues there. Still, death toll less 10% UK far apparently. saw duty firefighters grocery store masks noses strips covering nostrils- maybe bandaids something.

Science crazy... think people seeing cases tend plateau growth starts falter - has. past 2 days past weekend lower previous week. sign going fall. surges go forever, point falls. work? sounds good schedule. Brazil, city one thing. mine, 24-28 days. enough data make decision. Yeah you’re right. looked check can’t get vaccine without consent. asked states different  mean don’t live Michigan perhaps isn’t relevant, may true, don’t think people mostly “capitalism” bc living state restriction year isn’t natural state, covid isn’t deadly enough motivate ppl continue tired it. 4CHAN POST PROPHECY study, conducted May November, 10 percent 189 recruits COVID-19 antibodies re-infected. 48 percent — 1,079 — 2,247 Marine recruits study previously infected COVID-19 got COVID basic training.

Is spectacular failure protect Marine recruits stop spread virus generally? Recruits previously infected shocking 48% chance catching COVID 12 weeks basic training. 13 months since pandemic began, 10% Americans tested positive. means average 3-month risk 2.3%, Marines basic training ~20x higher risk general public. There's new article today saying moderna pfizer vaccines risk blood clots. price full year, semester 2 semesters. cost per semester half that. would need find college 130k annual OP wrong. valuable study, comparing like-for-like populations except one aspect they're studying. 

With Marines' focus uniformity, recruits previously COVID likely similar fitness-wise, age-wise, etc. not.

That said...

The study's results show COVID almost effective (80%) mRNA vaccines (95%) preventing future infection, *better* adenovirus vaccines (60-70%). That's actually strong argument people COVID *must* get vaccinated.

With mRNA vaccines plentiful supply, sure, afford vaccinate everybody, including previously infected, appears provide additional benefit. spinning facts seen through, statements like ""The findings make strong argument healthy young Americans get vaccinated, according researchers"" spinning facts here.

Antimaskers, antivaxers, etc. *wrong*, they're uniformly *stupid*, mistake think capable basic math above. ceased upward trajectory all..... graph clearly shows that. mean recently, hit active cases they've ever had.

Yes, science proving widespread enough whatever reason, bit nefarious.  clipboard lie magic tracking abilities. I’ll $1 billion. Maybe years though. see end sight USA, countries still widespread infections, lead new variants. 

Until places vaccinated, may new variants going around. 

It may take couple waves vaccinations finally stamp out. case, oral hookups, bet

Maybe know history dental dams. 80's everyone still scrambling figure HIV transmitted, condoms pushed pretty hard among gay community. Lesbians felt little left experts (yes, Fauci somewhat behind too) recommended use dental dams.

The CDC without asking several important questions dental dams--it pure knee jerk.

1) HIV transmitted via oral sex? (The answer know possible extremely, extremely rare.)

2) prevalence HIV among lesbians? (The answer extremely low.)

3) someone even feel pleasure dental dam? (Doubtful, CDC still researched this.)

And yet, 30 years later, pages dedicated dental dam usage, still showing sex ed courses, nearly impossible find find someone actually uses them.

HIV 100% lethal disease treated. serious disease. CDC mostly right think everyone protected even risk actual practicality zero. That's job. they're busy worrying us, doing?

But also entry one eat raw cookie dough too. yet, probably eat raw cookie dough. absolutely correct saying job. job people's job think ignore they're over-compensating risk.  like you’re getting downvoted even though that’s literally article says lol understand masks utilized reason yet currently way verify non-maskers fully vaccinated. Mask mandates need disappear certain vaccination levels reached however. That, really enough studies vaccines affect transmission people understand well vaccines work. Plus. many people stuck ""But vaccinated people still contagious!"" mindset even though there's strong data proving that. hoping Korea could get contained last year heard churches, clubs staying open events transpired :/ get needs done feel people stuck Georgia I've heard cognitive behavioral therapy really good tinnitus. noticed right ear since getting sick last February, considered seeking treatment. Wishing best immunisation today ! Translation: [The vaccine] good preventing severe [cases].

Pretty sure y’all downvoted normal comment wasn’t English. sure that. compare similar grouping people receive vaccine. 99.993% knew fact vaccinated person directly exposed virus fact. likely majority become infected without vaccine due nothing lack exposure virus. likely efficacy remains 95% MRNA's still nothing short miraculous. continuity Government priority Germany?

The government merrily go without chancellor mostly, principle ministerial autonomy. chancellor sets cabinet (decides many ministers, etc.) sets general guidelines policy. ministers however pretty free run departments also policy stuff long go general guidelines. chancellor administration mostly ""advisory""/guiding role. See Merkel right trying convince parliament follow ideas Corona guidelines ministers mostly tasked creating specific laws relate ministry.

You chancellors less involved, chancellors also head party comes influences. Merkel head party anyway, government running four years could easily continue vice chancellor (currently minister finance) another minister taking admin roles. links old megacomment, Maybe completely done much farther along terms getting handle situatuon. mention contries strict still experiencing waves infections. can't argue countries much. Ultimately every individual's responsibility take preventative measures try infect others. Even countries strictest controls, selfish individuals attempt skirt around every method mitigation. cases texas going down\\stagnant restrictions? pro-restrictions difficult explain people restrictions work Texas example. Well one thing sure big pharma ensure need boosters pockets lined. Yeah, study ongoing that’s data showing. fine, don’t take word it. Wait Pfizer releases this. Money money money, must funny I'm going recommend anything, simply parroting top scientists explaining. made blanket statement claiming using AZ vaccine wait instead could make sense, simply untrue. know full well risk clotting exponentially decreases age CFR exponentially increasing. 

So yes, 30 low covid exposure taking AZ vaccine may, balance risk, prove unwise. virtually every case however correct decision take vaccine get population immunised fast  say long one people loses family member vaccine available. Yes, vaccine overall great, disregard 'other people' disgusting me. many million people though? we've prioritized vulnerable people get shot first. expect people react vaccine, get crappy immunity it. infection, I've heard 7% people make antibodies. 

I'd say seven deaths huge success. 

So I'm going guess lower like vaccine program. number form, percentage 0.008%. That’s breakthrough cases are. Vaccines work. Suddenly phoenix.edu seem like bad deal. unfortunately live 3 COVIDiots lax social distancing mask rules. act like COVID police draining. worse vaccines implemented believing false harmful news them. I've become extemely pessimistic situation due fact. course Agreed, young healthy person doesn’t regularly get flu shots, front line Covid vax, moreso want return normal ASAP anything personal health. American, talk curfews lockdowns weird right now. can't imagine single politician US supporting things utterly roasted everyone else. global concern. felt decades.

I know worldwide numbers, last report saw USA said around 3,500 healthcare workers died due virus. Doctors usually study 10 years so, nurses bit less, on.

That LOT institutional knowledge killed pandemic. account people retired quit fear infected possibly killed, concern families.

This loss knowledge serious long term repercussions. quick easy way replace professionals lost expertise. Whitmer bind.

- 'it's flu' people certain persuasion never convinced lockdown needed
- pro-science crowd already gotten get vax really want suffer people making worse confirm preexisting views

So deep support shutting down. clearly combination individual factors like long sunless winters, prevalence B117, number kids attending in-person school spread control.

I assume state headed direction TX: 'if ignore long enough, sooner later it'll pass we'll die, either way done.' Tiktok isn’t one thing. It’s segmented app. tiktok pro vaccine that’s probably that’s content engage Yea public health office, like states have. incidence super low. US CDC reported 3000 cases 30 million total infections (in age groups), would expect 0.0001 cases develop MIS-C. Even P1 cause twice much MIS-C original variant, months apparent. world talking about?

A lot people get different vaccine. getting COVID ""guaranteed."" Thank you! Also dealing Trazadone withdrawal. I'm Venafexine now. Got sleep headaches gone. stopped permanently. also becsuse good position now, infections dead soon done vaccinating old people.

In places infections control hospitals overwhelmed that, would good use AZ. like verdict medicam authorities here. Probably much? gotta keep mind Germany really much centralized power. ministries, departments etc. run pretty independently chancellor. 

The chancellor's tasks mostly setting cabinet (which would still running) &amp; setting general policy tasks. chancellor ""Richtlinienkompetenz"", set legally binding formal guidance policies. ministers also able supervise ministries &amp; operations independently, set legislation (as long adhere broad guidelines), ""principle ministerial autonomy"". disputes ministries also settled within cabinet, would still active. Essentially chancellor decides want cabinet look (so many ministers, topics etc.), sets general guidelines supervises tries guide, mostly. They're involved day day running. 

If happened, President would probably ask vice-chancellor (Olaf Scholz, currently finance minister, also one candidates election October) take short term solution. he's also indisposed goes minister who's job longest, would Horst Seehofer, minister interior. 

The next priority would electing new chancellor, parliament own. Since new national elections October they'd probably decide elect someone current admin (since still majority). I'd probably someone Merkel's party, CDU. five CDU ministers currently, I'd put money Altmaier. could also decide stay short term solution October. convenient new discovery announced. Weird timing works. Chances death covid: 1/600. Chance death J&amp;J: 1/6000000. 

False choice. 

The alternative J&amp;J many people different vaccine week later, COVID. Curious function places lifting restrictions traveling testing general. evidence result less vaccine skepticism? tend believe result solid evidence back relied purely cost benefit analysis using things know conclude decision dumb. 

If FDA study shows halting vaccines 1 million risks makes vaccine hesitant portion population less hesitant open that. High 60s 16+ population gives 55% population overall. That’s number think circling. 

Given estimates circle around 1/3 population US prior infection would give 70% (1/3 remaining 45% 15%) population sort immunity.

Brazil even hit peak death rate yet. Vaccines win war, battle. way stop spike lockdown. whining feds trying pass buck.  I’m implying kids also spread adults. don’t exist bubble. There’s lot 45 adults hospitalized. school year ends 6 weeks. kids ok. 1. point repeatedly discussed 70-80%. I'm Michigan, nothing really left open, mask mandate working home possible.

Protecting citizens protects healthcare system. Protecting healthcare system comes back around full circle protecting you. seriousness, would make much sense host Summer/Winter Olympics two places, time.

I can’t comment Winter, think absolutely perfect place host Summer Olympics city like Los Angeles. already infrastructure (stadiums, lodging, etc) place host games, infrastructure well-maintained; it’s major city people want visit, weather beautiful… don’t live LA, makes sense me.

I understand every country wants host (going around world compete everyone else world — brings sort “unified” feeling), man, Olympics EXPENSIVE, especially whenever start square one, it’s huge waste whenever infrastructure becomes abandoned (looking you, Rio, example). completely understand people vaccine hesitancy. first too. wanted see data efficacy could make informed decision. data started coming trials safety efficacy 90% became brainer. someone hit 2% chance die day.... i'm like cool 2% worlds population like 160 million guess that's much alcohol probably help brain much normalised obesity? Otherwise proxy obesity? agree messaging needs better, science never use terms like ""almost all"". Science needs based statistics hard numbers. needs better done driving home numbers, explaining laymen clearly struggle basic mathematical concepts.

The thing messaging needs explain better strong probability something, based history well preliminary results. opposed denying existence proven beyond reasonable doubt. information Israel showing reduction transmission nearly good efficacy protection virus itself. CDC completed studies published official results, mean public needs dark completely. Worse yet fearmongered ""we know we're 100% sure"". Playing stupid manipulative mind games dumb. ""95% effective severe disease"" say full immunity. ""90% effective protecting covid"" *also* say full immunity.

Protected Covid could mean anything. vaccine stops dying still get asymptomatically infected pass someone else, qualify ""protected Covid""?

If going shit reading skills least quote headline actually says want say I'm gonna guess 70+ immuno compromised situation got second dose Pfizer January. Last month, boyfriend made trip city people obviously didn’t adhere CDC guidelines. boyfriend unvaccinated (couldn’t get appointment), ended testing positive days later. tested negative twice.
I’m glad able get vaccine bc hearing suffer heartbreaking. know would wait three months. Three weeks acceptable. country take leave it, reject vaccination want AstraZeneca, go back line mean waiting september later. face problem guarantee choose then. I'm actually finding lot older people previously pretending Covid exist exact flu getting shots now. lengthy phone call FIL last year right lockdown told hoax, conspiracy, flu kills more, let people die die gonna die anyway (yes, pro-life), blah blah blah. Even got first shot. step forward. leopards eating faces another post yesterday (I tried scrolling back find it, comment gotten buried ton others), someone remarked eight thousandths one percent. I'm working convincing mom. finally said would J&amp;J, news one think back square one. many dodge covid without vaccine? downside: Vaccinated people still contract asymptomatic Covid spread unknowingly. never get tested vaccination unless symptoms. study can't capture tested. Yes Yeaaaa. didn’t want dig data somebody else come conclusion already know: vaccines work. chance getting infected 34% like J&amp;J trials suggested, 0.008% like study seems saying?

I think there's solid percentage yet, definitely several hundred people. Regardless, undoubtedly *small* percentage people overall, certainly statistically significant enough anyone concerned whether getting vaccine worth it. one things aware of. would consider people who’ve one shot Pfizer Moderna completely unvaccinated also? Thank you! So, I’m understanding correctly - near 100% number result vaccine efficacy PLUS chance actually exposed. (Which greatly affected masking social distancing, etc)

To make absurd version would help explain it:

If tomorrow created vaccine claimed could stop elephants licking you, didn’t actually THING.

Clinical trials might show ridiculously low number tests elephants, efficacy rate among general population US would AMAZING.... since people come nowhere near elephants daily life. 

Hopefully ridiculous example showing right concept. I'm confused, office still power even enforce measures Michigan Supreme Court ruling? That's still unclear I'm trouble finding answer. Could reason enacting orders, would instantly struck down? Saying ok job first eight months doesn’t mean they’re close gold standard, especially Asia several countries contained it. made argument many times people. idea long term damage COVID done long term effects come it. People can't understand brand new virus viruses ""colds flus"". worst marketing public health folks categorize symptoms ""flu-like"". think I'm pretty informed, educated person even realized understanding disease basic flawed. need way better health based education America (among many things). hug family doesn’t make sense could hug stranger too? cell reception never better! problem necessarily believe facts data. problem who/where get ""facts"" and""data"" from. lot people believe kind thing fail able differentiate good bad data, thus believe one FEEL right potential truth.

Once becomes overwhelmingly obvious thing truth, revise position. Others dig heels. one happens depends person circumstances.

For anecdotal example. woman know thoroughly entrenched Fox news mantras completely Covid shot many reasons people are. vague conspiracy nonsense, legitimate worry. past months seeing people get shots, gone staunch anti-Covid vax, actually talking others doctor right her. side, know others dug heels gotten insistent never get it, whatever reason. Mostly reasons make sense data coming unreliable source cannot admit understand difference good data.

There's nuance believe facts data. Let's calculate scenario then. live Norway yesterday government said delay use viral vector vaccines delay age group would 7 weeks maximum. moment look cases past week risk getting infected 7 week period 0,64%. case fatality rate age group Norway 0,0093%, chances catching covid dying 7 week period 0,000059%. let's say risk dying complications AZ vaccine 1 500 000, that's 0,0002% chance. I'd 3,38 times likely die AZ vaccine wait 7 weeks safer vaccine. Would still recommend take AstraZeneca vaccine? I'm glad live political childishness stopping population getting vaccines saving 100,000's people regular basis. I’m would great sadly think significantly underestimating sheer force stupidity. Seeing antivax people fb. Like look Becky, I've seen cocaine back toilet frat house. Yet worried vaccine? Israel still closed tourists Like simply mandate vaccination. cute story. I’d rather live US, do. know question answered, vaccine available 18s without exceptional circumstances, (such high risk individuals) sorry, said vaccine instead virus. time covid spends host body, likely create mutation stronger may impact efficacy vaccine. R/titlegore Whoa! indeed serious.

I think reasonable pause vaccinations treatment found people would affected pre-filtered skipped. many? That’s better efficacy trials isn’t it? Cowards. Go get vaccinated live life. Stop keeping 12 kids bubble. excellent news, however suspect people contracted asymptomatic Covid get tested still could spread it. real number probably higher, certainly contributing now-increasing infection numbers US.

As someone vaccinated, reason tested (and probably wouldn't) unless symptoms. 45 kids hospital Michigan. implying millions kids get person education hospitalizations kids still lower flu season? Bring on. Fine me. Spread who? children? good news, course, really know post vaccine breakthrough rates instructed vaccinated people test unless symptomatic? really need random testing vaccinated unvaccinated population sustained period good idea breakthrough rate. I’m confident rate low, without testing people don’t experience symptoms won’t know. got first Pfizer shot yesterday, I've experienced sore arm. okay! worry. Makes sense 1 2. 3 much Tetanus bacterial infection. Measles, mumps, rubella largely eliminated populations sufficient vaccination programs, isn’t level mutation present something like flu COVID current state. cares sister works CNA state veteran's home. got 2nd dose almost 2 months ago. coworker constantly works side side refused vax caught covid end March. sister get sick friend almost ended ventilator week-long hospital stay. absolutely insane ppl take care covid patients refusing shot. Don’t play stupid. vaccines there, one potential harm people, let’s nip bud. need dramatic covid deaths may may occur someone isn’t getting particular vaccine... 1 — raw numbers clickbait? 5800/77,000,000 

2 — vaccines 95% efficacy, effectiveness. two different things 

3 — that’s likely, assumption. Again, we’re going data. 

You talk caring truth, one seems misunderstand critical terminology, ignoring data. said anything else, anti-mask/antivax crowd would print fake vaccination cards go back business usual.

“Oh yeah, I’m vaccinated, it’s okay”, little bandaids arms “make believable” shit. quite amazing. Florida, absolutely *no plan* Biden admin came power. Governor DeSantis pretty much abrogated duty citizens said, ""Let feds handle it"" while, time, everything could prevent local governments utilizing enforcing safety measures.

Within weeks new admin, military FEMA supersites place drive-up vaccinations. sites also spawning sub-sites across major metro areas even pop-up mobile sites move around accessed according published schedule.

I know people gotten vaccinated parking lots shopping malls, one Sears Tire shop, weird places.

It's still uncanny many people refuse, though. even strange see restaurants bars full capacity.

Florida, Florida things, guess. Never gonna happen unfortunately. 

And chance existed, would get voted fast dissapear noise. wish people get would stop talking groups people can’t get vaccine due health conditions allergies content vaccine...

and even people lie wearing mask get dies that’s like, good outcome.

furthermore, people get virus likely mutation immune vaccine pop I, one, greatly enjoyed Pfizer^^^^TM Windows Update flat wrong. got vaccine. Almost conservative friends family got well. liberal friends same. liberal friends refuse get well conservative friends. simple political party affiliated. 

Also, saying good thing people may die? need help. Mine same! He’s counting months turns 12. need shut Tik Tok. amount vaccine misinformation staggering. read somewhere takes thousands called idiots support talented individuals. can’t society without everyone one idea think they’re wrong. don’t think anyone would’ve thought NH would dropped yesterday could anywhere today 2022 ""breaking news, 95% 100%, vaccine companies warn us?"" difference vaccine simply Europe insisting negotiating contracts US said ""where sign?""?

In particular believe US basically waved liability EU insisted negotiating point. Technically testing .48 per thousand put perspective America 2.48 per thousand people tested. Japan also doesn’t pay it. None hospitals overrun business remained ongoing. essence zero change accept restrict travel essential business activities need take covid test 90 hours travel show proof. death rate 70 per million people compared 1701 US. want check numbers go. [Covid data around live? like kid mom would find different ways convince eat broccoli minority most. people problems measures taken. hear lot least I’m one bad luck lol. almost want assume quarantine however many days need instead getting poked brain swab. Looks brutal  Yup! inactivated vaccine, it’s kind lab technology several developing countries already have.

On hand, mRNA vaccine, it’s inaccessible technology.

Take Brazil example. We’re perfectly fine experienced producing inactivated vaccines, mRNA... it'd great people ability risk assessment like this....unfortunately, given reality world, pausing get total # everyone vaccinated far probably best way mount case go back redistributing J&amp;J. 

unfortunately life cannot go back normal people vaccinated....so guess gotta gotta scare large swathes people unable proper risk assessment. Everything packed Colorado actually open. Idk Rockies games though, considering ass. going guess live coast Well least Britain oldest first working younger ages whereas US something completely different letting everyone vaccine want less people die? willing miss parties prevent even longer pandemic. According survey third populace thinks lockdown strict enough. Weird right caring. use Pfizer, German? It’s really fucking annoying. get reporting serious adverse events reporting breakthrough cases dumbest shit ever. sometimes wonder there's PR war AZ driven big pharma companies. T

Personally, think started AZ delivering promised, press negative. People mad them. declared unsafe 65s (because little data everyone looked that). whole blood clot fiasco... 

Doesn't matter makes sense statistically still take it. looks bad otherwise healthy young women (and men mostly women) dying something supposed save them. Optics. Often, much drives human behavior based relationship environment. airport terminal space socially distance. confined space readjust mentality adapt new environment. none camps area require post travel quarantine. would surprised mandates like required summer. Last summer various day camps (masked) every week summer never mentions quarantine. 

As side note kids probably ""exposed"" (although masked) several hundred kids last summer camps issues COVID-19. know Google find horror stories friends also kids camp summer last year one ever got sick exposed.

A overnight camps know quarantine/ testing requirements last summer sure summer. could see overnight camps need strict given unmasked indoor time.  lay rest myth EU's vaccine export ban.


Tell Australia AstraZeneca vaccine exports blocked. sorry that. sucks. 

Vaccines free all. (our) government already paid doses, means I. store still requiring masks July think I’ll just.. go getting info? exact thing happened me. I'm 35 scheduled get vaccine Monday. Came fever Friday night tested positive Saturday morning. Almost made lol. I've since recovered first dose Pfizer. Maybe consider input scientists medical professionals friends. Great, we'll put covid pause weeks not. tell wait data. still confusing individual level decisions global decisions. I'm cancelling you, right now. Yes vast majority miscarriages happen first trimester. women well second trimester miscarriages much rarer (\~0.5%). definitely worth looking into, though right statistically speaking things bound happen point. sub-18 deaths involving covid since start pandemic.

700+ annual sub-15 drowning Dude. Again: it’s higher specific age group. Comparing specific age group general populace makes absolutely zero sense. Stop it. concern AZ isn’t it’s causing higher rate thrombosis everyone, severely higher rate people age 60 compared normally would expect. They're already vaccinating prio 3 Bavaria?

I'm prio 2 parents aunt uncle. None us vaccinated yet. got around grandfather quite quickly he's 94 probably many people ahead him. We're Lower Saxony. Also realise takes vaccinations effect deaths/day curve. People die COVID usually sick weeks. think take another weeks person registered dead show statistic. linked 2 top rate epidemiologists agreeing her. CDC directly using data. Pretty sure plenty infectious disease specialists involved. Personally think it’s kind crazy would recommend something zero clinical real world evidence. suspect work well based know vaccines wouldn’t injecting people based think might work out.  Exactly thought. I'm starting think pharmacist gave bogus answer similar person's experience

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* last weeks, we've seen number states PLENTY vaccines. Percentages shots distributed going rather up,

This literally doesn’t mean anything. shots hand doesn’t mean distribution infrastructure. amount daily vaccinations average still rising, important part. Eventually they’ll start go significant portions populace vaccinated.  Heavy reporting ""breakthrough cases"" despite small numbers percentage-wise new thing people media latching onto. figure? genuinely curious given flu still prominent. People cried AstraZenica, wanted prove wrong guess EU's *Single Market* depends open borders *Schengen System*. close borders extended periods time different vaccination rates would damage Germany EU. risk really higher unknown? think evidence suggest much risk mRNA vaccines everyone least 12.

I mean possible younger immune systems stronger/different reaction lasting side effects, data right suggest (and least data trials older ages suggest be).

And flip side think overly minimizing risks kids: data coming right suggest variants likely affect children children symptomatic cases chance long term effects. children school/day care, might risk post implies.

In summary seem prescribe risk analysis seems overly confident two different areas existing evidence would suggest. undoubtedly treatments offered US done EU research (or illegal here), particularly smaller diseases. 

But common medical issues think there's huge difference care receive. hospitals might shiny new know is. That's whole bunch UK, get card date batch number, that's it. even name it. bad sounds. people even affected curfew since responsible gather pandemic. Also welcome visit gonna see Germany bad all. Philly sadly still 50% 65+ Uhm no! needs high biosafety lab produce. think extra 50 strictly per capita, though UK. got small card batch number date jab it. even name written down. Makes sense! curious others doing.  close point Israel started seeing huge decrease cases? actually don’t care cases think hospitalizations deaths matter. restrictions based cases so... **MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

""Nearly 7 million Americans might get COVID-19 vaccine don’t know it’s free"" short term memory loss something? state closed parks almost two months  Yeah overall J&amp;J getting better month great sign. read bit topic mentioned it, specifically study.

It's interested hear Germany France recommending got AstraZeneca get Pfizer/Moderna second shot, wait 12 weeks instead usual 3/4.

Source: contrast, France’s health regulator recommends people age 55 received first dose AstraZeneca get Pfizer Moderna second shot. advises gap 12 weeks first second shots instances. regulator stated reason fear specific adverse events first AstraZeneca jab switch mRNA jab second.
Germany followed similar path. German vaccine committee recommended people age 60 received one shot AstraZeneca jab opt different vaccine second dose. may true, appears vaccine shortage mostly due EU fucking putting clause like UK contract. purpose. Either way, allows AZ Biontech Pfizer export countries fulfilling contractual obligations. did. believe Biontech catching up/overdelivering one wants AZ anymore anyway. 50k excess available appoints meaning ever person wants shot signed 50k left. Yeah don’t know who’s blame, much stupidity coming everywhere it’s embarrassing Yeah give perspective. 

Some people survived Spanish flu 1918, still signs immunity virus 80+ years later. 

People vaccinated 1976 swine flu time, mounted better immune response 2009 version, 33 years later. 

It possible immunity lasts long time. 

Boosters MAY needed virus mutates quickly even sure thing yet would every 6 months. likely 1-5 years. sub certainly help. go daily posts entire last year find 50 people chiming ""it free US, it'll probably expensive rich afford it"". Well seeing Europe hundred million people dense space US larger numbers vaccination, graph looks right. Oh still mocking US trump 4 years one, nothing change irrelevant this. Id disagree though say theres political spin saying need care us, need provide us freedom opportunity live parental figure describe. People don’t know employers probably won’t tell honestly. sports players wearing masks sidelines getting field court without them. theater.

In area wear mask entrance public place like restaurant take sit down. confirmed covid spread restaurants. Honestly ridiculous something completely ineffective meant make people feel better. Sure, Pfizer study based 1 week. 53-55

I suspect CDC went 2 weeks Moderna used two weeks, already confusing enough 21 days vs 28 days, etc. mistake trusting vaccine procurement supranational entity 

If entrusted EC alone might worked better. Problem EC acting basically EC sum 27 governments sitting table arguing buy conditions. US 1 guy could simply sign piece paper done. US vaccine production roll quite impressive. US may one better covid responses countries deal wild spread variants. 

Imagine vaccines never came be. wed lockdowns years years Ahh good know. forgot earlier mentions AZ would likely carrying heavy load worldwide. 

I heard many countries besides UK seem lion's share vaccine, perhaps they're widespread everywhere? I'm sure (Germans) miss Merkel lot leaves politics end year leading country many crisis one half decades... still overestimating relevance single individual global stability. hope do, months one incompetent candidates replace her. Another comment told AZ referring general blood clots Pfizer Moderna. 

So correct title Oxford study Pfizer Moderna possibly linked 4/1 million common blood clots AZ linked 5/1 million rare brain blood clots.

Honestly knew something fishy start study came out. garbage dangerous

Got something corroborate claim? It’s national pride, too. Sort of. Sinovac sold price pfizer $20. Az $4 &amp; production expectations 3 billions. one aside AZ cost. vaccine free everyone. Apply vaccine again, time say insurance. know comment applied 95% *all* comments website? see article linking poll they're referring to, bit disingenuous I'd say.

Judging date article one: question worded ""Are *ready* get vaccinated vaccine Sputnik V"", implying current thoughts absolute stance. Among people answered ""no"", 37% afraid side-effects 23% say needed wait end test, neither implies hard ""no"". Looks 60% wanting vaccine ""on fence"" opinion might change

All effort could nothing. Lol, know called “double mutant variant” dominant India. producing less pfizer. Astrazeneca alone 3 billion doses predicted 2021. real breakout star pandemic India massive Az production. Yeah state midwest 3 million population 7-day average sub 50 cases/day (peak 3000) 1 death/day (peak 58). 

Same deal state, every restaurant go packed. gym probably 80% precovid, 10% people wear mask working out. Obviously, certain things like still restricted like sporting events.

I'm sure due degree herd immunity seasonality thing.  grandparents Texas got shots doctors' offices months ago. doctors called bring in, good age group really tech savvy enough handle online system. Yep. We’re rapidly approaching time ability give doses tested. Ah, thank you, really thinking hardly last, really struck lot hopelessness. know one knows anything sure yet, hearing likely lasts longer, makes feel lot better. 50/50 rolled dice, likely ended prince philip too! Brazil literally right US per capita deaths according Worldometer.

Brazil likely undercounting deaths even US is. bought tickets small indoor concert June. place famous venue shows postponed canceled year, one first ones booked. sure kind precautions, care, point I'll vaccinated 2 months ready anything. recording APIC panel CDC days ago goes cases want info PHDs Even companies try right thing, still revert back evil greedy natural selves. really. lot gain hosting Olympics. Got damn. right. thinking. reports according real Covid deaths figure Russia 4 times official figure. Perhaps Russians would willing get vaccinated aware real Covid death figures. get extra doses sources, timeline moves again. 

I also expect NACI least somewhat revise recommendations soon, hopefully groups 55 get AZ too. say always said job properly, job. heard double mutant cheese, aka combo #3. misunderstand Sinovacs predicted production 2021. Pfizer produces &amp; continue forseeable future. saw ad TV like, ""The vaccine available, might questions, ok questions, safe effective, go web site info"". Honestly pretty vague wimpy. concerned vaccine would nothing all.

They simply say get vaccinated everyone know get back lives sooner. guess stuck idea even vaccinated people spread virus (despite proof lots proof contrary), say anything might encourage people loosen vaccinated. ""Abundance caution"" leads ""complicated communication"". That's fetish! yet consequence Curious well. Oxford, right? many mRNA vaccines wonder? (With atleast week two lag time) second site. Good masks, legit shit.  TIL 24,000 people NYC. 

Indeed, soon we’ll herd immunity currently, might 300-400k shots available use though city state getting millions more. 😎 per capita Yeah, would guess cold. yes possible covid. Yet EU even considers export ban get shit everyone. true even best expect 2 billion doses year. Pfizer expects 2.5 billion, moderna 1 billion, Astrazeneca 3 billion. that's counting Novavax, J&amp;J, Sputnik, &amp; undoubtedly forgotten.


Sinovac role play best expect innoculate 1 billion patients doses. KNOW lasts six months. likely lasts much, much longer. Source this? usually cannot choose vaccine get Germany. 
It may well politicians got Biontech available, beginning, Astra Zeneca used people 65 data older folks lacking. 

Now side effects blood clots younger people better data efficacy older ones, turned it’s used people 60 years. like flu matter anymore vast majority people. yeah, never eradicate US. college kind enough charge full price labs wasn’t allowed step foot in, instead us watch YouTube videos people performing lab least 6 months.

The media done terrible job stressing this. 

They recently examined phase 3 trial participants found strong immunity 6 months start. cannot say longer 6 months yet cannot time travel. 

The vaccines likely last least year easily could provide decent protection several years even decades. Herd immunity. Vaccines. Vitamin AZ sun! “you gotta show example” mindset lot things good bad thing 

Most money spent outside EU runs back EU sooner later. often like investment happen pure good will.

I personally would like get vaccinated soon tbh think good distribute it. nations need EU citizens, included, contributed EU's wealth vaccine development way would justify prioritized rollout. I'm also super positive mRNA vaccines super happy get Pfizer vaccine. However, preservatives metals necessarily make vaccine unsafe. Whatever vaccines tested safety trials approval. 

The reason things like preservatives removed vaccines recent years antivax advocates making Appeal Nature fallacy convince people vaccines safe. reality removing preservatives opposite made vaccines less safe distribute areas without cold storage public health officials able vaccinate many people remote areas. Generation C-minus Well, biggest hesitancy vaccine ""long term effects,"" kind makes sense older population willing get it. That's something worried well know high risk covid complications. I'd rather take chance 2 doses AZ. ask proof insurance need provide it. They’re starting challenge trials UK shortly, apparently. [UK challenge require people attending vaccinated?  wife prio 3 (and fourty) vaccinated next week Bavaria. Though could choose vaccine. said normal cold symptoms. asked lost taste/smell, said no. told assume COVID then, pretty much freaking point. post sponsored Pfizer We'll 48 million doses end June (not including J&amp;J) 30 million adults. ugly right huge light end tunnel.

We're speculating degree. one knows sure anything. go by, witness far. AZ, even though vaccine safe, removed European countries.

It possible occur JJ findings inconclusive pause.

We're talking minute numbers millions people pose quite challenge narrowing leads risk.

We shall see.  Going keep wearing mask spite. Hahaha. fucking waste. Lets hold hands march oblivion belong.

No scientific reason keep mask wearing full vaccination Hey guys know may dumb question but, J&amp;J plants still producing vaccine shipping CDC?

That's whole point trials studies. literally scientific process about. make hypothesis try prove wrong see ideas correct. got R=0.7 vaccination like Israel we'd less month. know supposed take anything prior (or any) vaccine. seen anything taking something shortly after. source anything this?  invited Reddit. problems “more complex” because

Women's bodies simply stuff men's bodies do. amount research change that. stuff always comes complexity. controversial fact. gets us faster enough people enroll trials, trials take longer, vaccine takes longer get cleared kids.

Is shortage people signing also think really understood post. talking small risks coronavirus ""your"" kids vs small risks vaccines that's consideration parents. isn't.

I'd argue signing kid risk, matter small, **their** safety indeed important. 

I know parent not, I'd take 100% chance anything bad happening 1% chance happening daughter. endanger anybody outside household. 

When vaccine shown safe kids, I'll first sign up. would never sign trial help society whole thought net benefit her. im kind guy use two masks sure mix vodka get better participation pasters blessed day western culture (vast majority Reddit) typically put individual risk societal benefits. families individual/family risk higher participating trial (assuming parents close contacts get vaccinated kids transmitting big concern considering covid risk really low children). families parent high risk close contact unable vaccinate things different that’s small ish group  conservative - vaccines reported today actually given past ~3 days. also end many places soon. 

Not Monday every American adult even chance get vaccine take time get shots immunity. ""smart"" son-in-law tells get vaccinated ""there's enough research."" Seriously, horrible crimes confess probably time. ones going worry light fraud... mean don’t disagree you. also consider people drink much, smoke, eat terrible food even though think everyone knows consequences.

I honestly think also people making money bc lockdowns/covid (commercial real estate investors waiting rock bottom? Big pharma? Big box?) think sides interests continuing each, root always money went public university, although one expensive public universities country. $13K per year, received financial aid form grants subsidized loans. Ultimately delays ability buy home attend grad school, public universities shouldn’t crush debt like private schools do.

As time goes on, people get vaccine, data improves, get better idea, true. really hope MRNA stuff works out, could literally change everything handle vaccines disease treatment future. understand wanting rush inject infant suddenly making person ""antivax"" ""insane"" Well mean going vaccines. weeks Pfizer Vax instead AZ one point many 13 year olds know exactly want grow up? like cant go trade school later.  issue isn’t clots, rather, blood clots (specifically CVST) conjunction thrombocytopenia. least US, FDA said reported cases mRNA vaccines. studies done effective one dose variants?  still required almost every place business so, bump Tokyo 2024; Paris 2028; L.A. 2032. 2020 Games retroactively canceled (or ""annulled"" whatever, using term ""cancelled"" screws anything w.r.t. contracts)

It's simple, health-conscious fair almost everyone. like it! makes that's happen  :-/ Johnson Johnson vaccine uses vector Astra Zeneca, patterns bloodclots seem similar - overwhelmingly appear young women. J&amp;J, every single blood clot woman ‘of child bearing age’.

I’m scientist seems could probably continue roll J&amp;J men older women nearly zero risk, whilst investigating affects young women prioritising different vaccines? don’t slow overall rollout side effect large affects one demographic. now? would realistically, without benefit hindsight, done differently man?  4 weeks Uruguay too.

What happens cases get quarantine? lockdown again? don't, delaying inevitable. do, continued restrictions even country hits herd immunity. I'd also point herd immunity stop transmission prevent us vaccine-escaping variant mutating right home. Nah, mask mandates already coming state state.  agree hope true. I'm epidemiologist looking daily cases using basic human pattern recognition, starting look like beginning end them. 7 day average still increasing mean level off, beginning falter bit said, curve appears starting bend downward/less steep. looks pretty similar beginning part many peaks we've seen past year.

But committee independent say recommendations. don’t answers yet it’s new technology monitored problems. questions answered time looking outcomes vaccinated individuals terms side effects effectiveness mass scale long term. It’s simple. no, misinformation gasp!

Never forget damage man caused country.

It's really sad moment man says something heard anyone else say before, **know** I'm going start hearing right. parrot pathetically predictable point. man could say ""anime greatest thing ever"" sudden, would boomers watching anime. fucking bizzare. idolize obvious con artist. depressing. heard estimates closer 2-3 months. But, that's based read, may 100% accurate obviously change quickly. Vaccine ""imprinting"" immune system seen many viruses generally causes vaccines designed tackle mutations [less antibodies original vaccine. see influenza many viruses. Worked long time dementia care.

Pneumonia's first sign elderly always cough/poor lung sounds. cardiac stuff happens first (swelling lower limbs, chest pain, arrhythmia). would probably easier convince parents covid deadlier children. current numbers that’s hard argument make since vaccine risk low (but proven low since trials weren’t done yet) covid risk children really low (I’m assuming parents able get vaccinated child transmitting big concern - people don’t even vaccinate bot gonna sign kids trials it’s mute point) wearing masks 2050 what? think Nate Silver completely uninformed.

It makes sense now. Travellers quarantining like supposed to. heard easier transmissibility variant true, idiots responsible climbing infection rates.  arguments leave 4 months even extend 6 months. Since 6 months standard vaccines allows robust response. Think like studying test longer study better do. depend real world data coming in. Regardless day celebrate 1st shots completed. 36% first shot. 24% fully vaccinated. One controlled phase 3 trial 10k people Brazil. basically live monitoring 10m(!) people got vaccinated.

2.) need *that* much exposure. 10-30 minutes per day, even mask.

3.) Vitamin deficiency common, we've easy ways combat it. also get vitamin via diet. Red meat, fish, fortified milk (plant-based animal-based), fortified OJ, eggs, mushrooms, multivitamins vitamin D.

TL;DR - There's realistic way wearing mask going make break vitamin levels. lifestyle, vices, habits what's going that. mean, we're looking 10,000 people dying day. Healthcare managing risk, personally publicly. Right now, risk possible lethal side effects vaccine completely outweighed risks COVID-19, individually public health issue. I'm interested holds people get vaccinated. think may falsely low (although expect go high either). 

What kind people make data?

The first big round vaccinations nursing home folks high risk peeps...not party people. know high risk butt continued isolate I'm yet fully immune continue careful bc even vaccine blunted covid going treacherous me.

So. I'm sure data reflects normal daily life. many laying low abundance caution? True anti vaxxers would picked it, reason almost everyone country knows half dozen cases CVST every J&amp;J appointment cancelled. 

This big lesson Barbra Streisand effect. one talking blood clots Monday. Sounds right. 70-80% probs NH, appointments easy come now.  I'm 30-40 age group coworkers got first jab one day eligibility (April 1).  took 10 minutes site, leapfrogging better better Apts. someone wants get ought able get one sooner

That said feel mask Mandate stick around another 6-8 weeks, get one worst beers ever made

The vast majority unvaccinated people ""dodged"" COVID last months well. misleading borderline misinformation, imo. 

I say someone getting second dose tomorrow thinks everyone, EVERYONE get vaccinated. Chances death covid: 1/600. 
Chance death J&amp;J: 1/6000000.
Chance blood clot birth control: completely acceptable. 


Better pull guys.  high absolute beginning, steadily fell people lost patience. like everybody else’s.  truly horrendous. saw someone mention non covid related reddit sub day vaccine gives 3 months protection virus. people getting information? can't figure real. high number horror stories. vaccines remarkably effective safe. overwhelming majority side effects perfectly tolerable. Pain around injection site, mild moderate fever, headaches, fatigue horror stories. 

I'm asking details believe wrong. want find came believe something far removed truth.  I'd recommend going restaurant chef sneeze mouth “It is. die, die”

I think I’ll wait till get research thorough instead creating new study every month. They’re already claiming need third shot won’t stop there. don’t even know different vaccines interact long run. Maybe find one boosters planned maybe it’s worth try (assuming mutations won’t trash whole operation). pay bill instead.if not,the government pay. symptoms? Mild? Severe? definitely aren’t alone, I’m two threads different subreddits dedicated people got J&amp;J recently anxiety issues.  guess agree point? test people unless self-reported sick. means likely missed bunch cases.  Found chemist reason reassuring people's brains wired-up properly understand risk. takes study training. 

Risk actually determined what's called Bayesian process. Sure, risk one, rare side effect might much lower assume risks vaccine risks contracting COVID-19. fails take account risk dying COVID-19 receiving vaccine versus dying COVID-19 received vaccine. 

It's kind like looking risky die high speed street race wearing seatbelt versus wearing seatbelt. look risk death wearing seatbelt, overall odds probably reassuring. look death rate population street racers versus people street race, issue seatbelts matter more. Seatbelt no, prior probability dying automobile crash lot lower street race. similar vaccine. get vaccinated, risk dying decreases much odds possible rare lethal side effects matter. wonder many additional people want dead. 

Moderna filing full approval. expected granted late expected follow suit month. friend clinical trial got third Pfizer shot like week ago. Double blind trial, either got third identical shot (same first two), third specifically designed SA variant Also, UK keeps vaccines AstraaZeneca UK. 2 factories EU exported vaccines UK. EU received single vaccine two factories UK. like Israel, UK play fair like countries within EU. Okay since I’m expert let’s way. I’m saying I’m sure many receive two doses Moderna/Pfizer reluctant receive booster shot fall/next spring average Joe opinion, think it’s best advocate people vulnerable groups get instead forcing everyone get otherwise people backlash hell break lose. Pardon take don’t agree opinion. NORMALIZE SAYING FUCK TWITTER

NORMALIZE SAYING FUCK TWITTER Pfizer Moderna. get people seem think Ad vaccines, them. marginally likely potential clot J&amp;J AZ, 5 per 1 million 4 per 1 million...

There's definitely sort weird smear campaign going (not saying part it, course). Whenever something negative comes AZ J&amp;J vaccines, news. anything Modern Pfizer hear it.

EDIT: [A company pay it,if government pays  Nice Next step enjoy food restaurant Well know, 2% overall chance dying Covid scary 0.0001% chance getting blood clot. Well, send friend Pfizer trial home test feeling good. Ended negative. think J&amp;J testing w/o symptoms look asymptotic spread. Yet another different trials. point really data gives us good relative comparison yet. trials simply different. like saying car gets better gas milage car b. car tested level road car going hill. Apples oranges. Yeah sure I’m sure shit taking cheap knock vaccine people smug online. Getting Pfizer Moderna soon it’s available area, I’ll let others roll dice please. Inconceivable. *Only* eight time less likely get deadly blood clots vaccine. Fuck that. unacceptable fuck anyone trying gaslight us thinking acceptable risk. Get moderna Pfizer ban shit vaccines illegal imo Uh, ok? people purposely injecting covid? I’m pro vaccine argument literally makes sense. said someone China told every 6 mo got downvoted hell No...no, think completely fair. stupid self-selecting.  gave honest chance many years ago appeal me. like drinking carbonated water. fair though beers tend enjoy 7% ABV 13.5% ABV usually stouts, imperial stouts, Belgian ales, IPAs, hefeweizen, Märzen, Cream Ale, porters. system profit sadly.  Stupid people stupid. plague going simmer unvaccinated population time. family wipes groceries religiously, never bothered went along it. Today it’s two weeks since second shot grabbed fast food without wiping wearing gloves...not really sure feel think good? Lol Yes read 50.7% efficacy preventing symptomatic infections, 83.7% effective preventing mild cases needing treatment. efficacy symptomatic infections increased 62.3% interval 21 days two doses Dishonestly telling position arguing position assigned isn’t worth vaccines met criteria EUA, including safety follow up. say there's safety review false. need look FDA advisory committee review documents. abide rules anyways. got food delivery permit (never done job). got used staying home anyways 50% 4/20. Thanks tip think people forgetting automatically assuming worst. think much vaccine hesitancy lack convenience. people getting shots tacked doctor's appointment they're already going local grocery store gives kind rewards program points it.

Speaking experience, I'm currently eligible, gotten vaccine yet. I've busy work things, time try tracking one yet. also know I'm low risk others need appointments me, too. wearing 15 minutes? perspective world? living shell long contact outside world 15 minutes store?

Dude, normal. Masks normal. communicate mouths, make sound (something masks muffle) also communicate intention emotional state.

If can't understand that, please seek help. mention various misinformation sites got 2nd dose Pfizer today. First dose felt fine one already getting rough. Got chills bad headache. Anyone else tell else expect? 2 days I’m good? fudged numbers high 200k, imagine actual count is. I’d say easily greater 500k day. Remember North Dakota? population density thing. pockets throughout state readily available. one pockets able/willing drive distance, problem. Local state house. make news might even get jail cell lick.  No, issue British redditors feeling butthurt don’t blindly trust British/Swedish vaccine harmless. also government funded India seems new US terms high case numbers. 214,000 confirmed cases far today, two times higher worst day first wave, 97k. increase daily case numbers slowing either. worst probably unfortunately yet come. people get flu recover rather easily

Most people get Covid recover rather easily too. ones tend far worse outcomes flu. COVID-19—the actual disease—poses 8 10 times threat blood clots brain coronavirus vaccines 

If get jab, 100% got jab. risk clots COVID job, would 10%-12% chance getting COVID waiting different vaccine. that's true (anymore). Israel shows fully vaccinated people lower chance transmission also effect case rate. good sign indeed though. extend immunity goes another question (i.e. would expect heavy viral load unvaccinated person weak immune system reduce fully ""just"" low asymptomatic degree).

The dangerous aspect people knowing time takes build immunity first shot flouting rules etc. specifically waited 11:30pm 

I like this. stupid government want stop it. Because, ideas, desperate ""something"". know real driver viruses mutate? Evading vaccines one sure. Beyond social behavior (definitely thing), new variants changed game. unique India (this driver second waves), India definitely getting hit harder most. 

If R0 original COVID strain 3, current measures natural immunity meant R(t) kept around .9-1.2, variant increases transmissibility 4.5 means public health measures immunity lead R(t) 1.5-2. That's causing vertical spike. thats great country rapidly vaccinating proven massive factor saving lives, can't necessarily pick choose vaccines. True, cases climb hospitalizations fall likely continue reopen. idea ""vaccines...are poor protecting particular individual"" anti-vaxxer, fake science nonsense.

That's simply true. FFS, there's story sub 99.992% fully vaccinated Americans protected COVID.

Obviously herd immunity exists benefit, there's scientific basis claiming individuals anywhere near susceptible post-vaccination pre-vaccination.

Even saying ""individuals still get it"", technically true, relies small number edge cases basically lie. (Almost) everything open month.
Passover, independence day, restaurants etc. think much said (and gained) plain old boring ass politician office. He's probably gonna go history among greats, getting job done far.

It also immense relief wake every morning without thinking immediately, ""Did asshole die sleep? not, stupid shit tweet morning?"" turn computer sense impending doom. agree you, also ridiculous government would pay people protect potentially deadly disease. fucking strange. guys even statewide mask mandate lol. even stressed about? little surprised getting votes. sub AstraZeneca vaccine great vaccine, smear campaign destroyed it. kinda surprised people see way JJ.  I’m calling bullshit statistic sounds like bullshit. get vaccines work 99.992%? Come on... Quite right.  

I made comment elsewhere (not well written) effect people really like seeing; ignoring truth make go away, I've got nothing say that, moment.   


Thank excellent well-worded comment! implies people confer immunity. Many us dropped COVID-19 precautions since vaccination getting sick. vaccine trials messaging like ""This vaccine X% effective okay 100% effective preventing hospitalization death""

.... way describing saying they're actually 100% effective we're immune can't transmit virus all. That's really confusing I'm someone that's actually following trying pay attention it. Hey now. Get disregard science /s Obligatory, saying immunity lasts 16 year? /s really can’t compare genomic sequencing capacity UK country. point stop variants much possible boosters give us sterilising immunity variants. We’ll wait autumn those, travel banning absolutely something UK doing. theory, ""perfect Lockdown"" would useful total, complete, 100% enforced. virus spreads person person, clinical sense, everyone locked separated, spread would stop. Sure, it'd nightmare scenario, *theory* it'd work. However, reality works different theory, public policy needs formed around *reality* fantasy wishes.

Also, half baked measures serve irritate people still plenty vectors transmission flowing freely equivalent gaping hole chest putting band-aid covers 30% hole. Maybe rates go we’re stuck inside cicada plague. Sounds like shit hole country USA. least seem good president. mention lack availability Pfizer vaccine places outside North America shown best bunch them(not Moderna one bad mind you). contrast, team found little evidence virus spreads easily via large droplets, fall quickly air contaminate surfaces. 
The new work serious implications public health measures designed mitigate pandemic. First, ""droplet measures"" handwashing surface cleaning, unimportant, given less emphasis airborne measures, deal inhalation infectious particles suspended air. 

This really says it? Considering many confirmed cases globally, always highly suspicious single one could ever definitively traced back surface contamination. one case concluded caused elevator button due lack evidence, there's really substance it.

Like article says, ""original"" health measures hand washing spraying disinfectant everywhere obviously detrimental (well, maybe overuse sprays are), handwashing common sense anyway. really saddening see many people *still* post sub they're still putting Amazon boxes quarantine 3 days dousing groceries disinfectant there's absolutely reason be. Spend money proper mask instead 6-pack lysol. Unfortunately family members north kids can't get vaccinated comfortable us coming high infection place due kids. Also, husband's work PTO freeze cases decrease stop spread shop. aren’t even close. Kids still basically toothless plea.

Every company deny home office employers flimsy grounds possible. company example that. know home office absolutely possible I've worked home week corona app warned critical contact, afterwards come work again. nothing do. would frankly pushing hard SA (and others situation) taken consistency decision-making process outset. 

This 100% makes feel political.  almost herd immunity lot areas due vaccines previous cases antibodies vaccines (at least approved US, I'm less familiar data others) anywhere 58%-90% effective preventing covid infection, depending vaccine, variants present, overall exposure risk. point masking good one, good picture yet.

Initially, vaccine data showed prevented hospitalization death. since rare cases hospitalization despite fully vaccinated, though number extremely small relative chances hospitalization/death unvaccinated covid infection. mention social distancing? really need vaccine get pandemic. vast majority people fully vaccinated, need social distancing anymore. get second next week. I've heard anecdotally drinking lots water day helps mitigate symptoms? 

Could bullshit I'm giving go. said know gives immunity. early tell - without risking ""source?"" back. want Twitter ""source?"" you. would PR nightmare. still optimistic overall, almost this, strongly believe decision cause needless death harm. 

I think may actually page saying slightly different things. support letting people die flu season, go bars/restaurants without mask.  mean, governments stupid, governments become stupid, too? 
What happens i.e. France pure horror and, mind, useless. 
All go shopping time, hang place.

People getting crazy. agree, I’ve already talked 11 yo it, knows he’ll getting soon it’s available kids. husband got first pokes week, knows isn’t something nervous over. He’ll going 6th grade next year needs booster shots anyway. obvious one saving life)

That one works really older people, much younger people. think sold vaccine young people way get bottomless mimosas guilt free, might get traction. got pfizer days ago, side effects whatsoever. fine. vaccine. Yeah still cautious even vaccine.  someone sneezes covid rear ends driving? still affect you. wonder, paying 65K semester e-learning seems bit much me. Didn’t like 7 die? This. idea get vaccinated nothing changes deterrent actually getting vaccinated. Better us? I'm Ontario. Michigan WAY worse currently. Yeah, spike completely different magnitude. practically vertical line. They'll run testing bottleneck soon possible appear level off, absolute disaster. 

The silver lining pretty massive vaccination program underway able help keep death rates low(er) get enough shots arms. issue, course, 3 million shots per day much context country 1.4 billion. They're two months early wave. Oh get now, thought talking actual ninjas killing people ask commenting 16th century Japan something... Vaccines available state residents  become available general population Massachusetts (where live) April 19th. majority people see obviously eligible (not obviously 40+ obviously suffering pre-existing condition). 


You asked someone explain might still mask mandates vaccinated people. Take leave -- that's still place live. confused, thought vaccine stop catching disease guaranteed get hospitalized die?

See, result (imo irresponsibly dangerous) incorrect messaging vaccinated people still catch disease. might true very, small amount people, per headline. almost fully vaccinated people immune spread virus. mean.. ya'll want we're dying (literally) Canada, friend send up? Please? Sorry absolutely insane apples feces comparison.


Make whatever political statement want comment understand type poverty living conditions areas Brazil class compared even poor downtrodden parts America. disagree. son danced dance studio massless year since May zero outbreaks. even live unmasked Nutcracker 3 live shows outbreaks. study since knowledge.

There one 6 years.

It's complicated cross reactivity SARS-CoV-2, now, 18 years later. bet another study planned. 

Sera people recovered Covid19 got least one shot Pfizer neutralized SARS-CoV(-1).

So really see variants would problem. Long lasting immunity infection (when know mRNA vaccines likely give better immunity), plus broad immunity variants means definitely seeing bright light end tunnel. commenters US, default assume US involved discussion. Agreed. Probably former. 16 years since SARS like detect longer that. Why? Assuming get vaccinated, stopping grandparents meeting kid. Bhutan vaccinated 90% population iirc, move lol percent unvaccinated people dodged COVID similar timeframe? imagine it’s lower vaccinated population it’s going best point comparison still going high (probably north 99%). No, restrictions need keep excess deaths flu fairly non-noticeable level prevent hospitals getting completely overwhelmed. Sadly covid that's case. unfortunate one year still quite grasped basic facts. Yeah, kinda thought Got second moderna shot April 1st, yesterday started feeling sick basically first time since 2019. Mild shortness breath, aches pains, feeling really tired. morning kind dry cough. 

Got tested yesterday, still waiting results. think it’s way late feeling vaccine effects, I’m hoping it’s cold something. I’m part 0.008% get COVID everything right whole year I’m gonna pissed Would rather plane someone false negative? would insist anyone taking vaccine particular. would insist taking vaccine soon tell small risk J&amp;J vaccine young people. want wait weeks can. CDC saying J&amp;J vaccine regardless risk. Think vague evidence least one variant able spread easily children. anymore lethal. contagious. alone enough see stuff like rise. thing deaths hospitalizations amongst younger people, getting ill - friends managed stay uninfected entire pandemic getting infected variants circulating contagious. Umm live Tennessee it’s thing anymore. Vaccines widely available everyone. Numbers way down. Deaths hospitalizations way misleading.

The vast majority unvaccinated people ""dodged"" COVID recently well. misleading borderline misinformation, imo.

I say someone getting second dose today thinks everyone, get vaccinated. read another headline social media posted anti-vaxxer said THOUSANDS people received vaccine still got infected, vaccine useless. like one better. leader doesnt give fuck people. live Florida. Numbers recently disappointing. hopes summer road trip son (born right pandemic) meet family (some passed away got meet them) doubt happen. shit show. Yeah, new emerging variants target.

I also hope see production come available. hoping treat global population we'll need quickly increase supplies well. know vaccinate new variants *and* include next year's worth original vaccine. would ideal, think. huge number people without access vaccines around world. Headline saw: ""CDC tracking nearly 5800 breakthrough cases fully vaccinated people""

In article: Epidemiologist quoted saying ""This great news, better expected, there's 6000 cases, asymptomatic mild"" bad can’t figure prescription people would WANT take repeatedly boost bottom line, maybe mix heroine .. errrrr,uhhhhhhhh wait folks oxy, oh fuck I'm sure got best interest heart all! least government looking us!, world could go wrong!  nice see remote places would never see covid first place getting vaccines Johnny street may give new strain covid essential enough get one, allowing contract special strain first place. expected wait turn, lower population area, less prone major covid outbreaks. shows matter rural home is, ENTIRE TOWN deemed essential, get first. sound like someone shares news facebook It’s name, South Dakota *US government* producing vaccines themselves, yes, would make sense keep US citizens. US preventing private companies using US factories fulfill deliveries countries. results bizarre situations like Pfizer-BioNTech supply Canada factories located EU, would obviously much sensible ship Wisconsin factory. 

The US's blocking exports raw vaccine materials caused[ slowdown vaccine production US considering [blocking exports medical too. policy started Trump Biden never reversed. Honestly, think US pretty bad vaccine nationalism.  Europeans finally started realize Americans never supported lockdowns? state from? live Fukushima. water radioactive much. ocean handle fine every adult getting vaccine wild kids getting them. husband fully vaccinated hurrying sign 13 year old sons get one. wouldnt say case dependent, I'm noticing US, hospitalization dependent. US? Icelandic Olympics let’s go!! I've saying since June. let drop masks end 2022 probably 2023. well 50 cases per 100,000 week I’m Losing loved one always terrible, pandemic, vaccine, vaccine. 

Look, I’m saying good thing. I’m saying look glass half full perspective. least vaccines sufficient demand. never said was. South Africa isn’t slouch comes sequencing right kept B1.1.7 P.1 less bay, despite admittedly fewer resources African continent cover. UK, probably one countries consistently throughout pandemic. Nothing we’ve told world B1.351 thus far turned untrue compared real-world behaviour. 

There scapegoating, hence travel ban. 

If you’re worried who’ve given AZ UK, hope it’s well-known smaller studies SA never geared towards testing efficacy severe illness, hospitalisation, death, may well likely effective three. population SA young - simply kinds sample recipients, target recipients fell within average age range 30-odd (our median 28) comparatively unlikely they’d develop severe COVID symptoms outset comparison people higher average age trial settings. want save many lives possible? restrictions key.

Do support lockdowns annually flu season? Maybe silver standard, leave gold standard places like Taiwan Vietnam, contained outbreak entirely months. Japan death rate orders magnitude lower developed countries outbreak never squashed. vaccine rollout extremely lackluster considering little chance substantial amount population vaccinated Olympic ceremony (97 days away) becoming super spreader event actual danger. states 18 makes around .04% official COVID deaths. accurate, big deal. think call ""medium covid"". percentage, number. known cases, also factual social distancing masks work, obvious instances people getting covid go mandates lifted.  We're asking like another month two. states already metrics want hit rid them. Ohio 50 cases per 100,000 week..after point, restrictions gone. Kentucky 2.5 millions people vaxed. Look state see saying. combination P1 Variant poor health care system Brazil. certainly infectious based structures we've seen, proper health care system probably die young (although chance it). Shouldn’t boosters necessary risk (elderly, immune compromised)? Even different strains would think risks would need take boosters. Lol post wrong article buddy? Biden placing orders today. Embarrassing…. I've specifically waited 11:30pm hit Rewe throughout pandemic since empty fuck feel like socially considerate going peak hours. Germany really 24 hour culture like US is, I'm really sure much difference curfew gonna make here. Like clubs closed, intent stop people gathering parties night, still done current legal restrictions without curfew. kind news doesn’t help comes 40-45% US population indicating won’t take vaccine various reasons; level validity refuse. they’re people hear kind news it’s resulting reconsidering get it.  Yes bit werd system place accurately reflect amount vaccinations given.

But understandable, considering major scale system, security concerns involved privacy issues.

It mean tampered with, transparent estimations made made now. 

Estimations probably precise enough purpose serve. Policy made based hospital bed availability mostly.

I'm glad chose conservative revise upward. would've handled another setback much worse. public health agency right thing putting health safety public first. Completely means zero, one million. P1 variant discovered recently; UK variant first discovered U.S. January take hold now. Considering happening Brazil, take variant lightly. understand perfectly, making exactly point. hard read?

I've already received first dose, whenever 5 year old public, ALWAYS make sure he's wearing mask, me. 

I'm making point wear masks regardless vaccination status numbers show safe stop wearing them, matter state local mandates say. 

Even then, whole pandemic thing shown masks multiple advantages disadvantages, preventing transmission diseases; allergy season, wear mask whenever work yard, wind sneezing head pollen minutes like previous years lol got JJ 4-11 36F.

Well one gonna stand won’t stand yourself. sure kind temporary contract work you’re on, sounds like another labor violation punish forcing obey law. dunno Americans ever get debt prices

Financial Aid, Grants, Scholarships people middle/lower classes. 

Upper classes pay cash front little worry.  dumb country endemic spread already. understand desire control variants, otherwise country like Canada like trying patch leaky faucet fire sprinklers going overhead. significant regional variation, coming US technically less risky average Canada example based cases per capita. 

New Zealand, China, Australia enforce strict quarantine reason. EU also receiving more. skeptical people may “big pharma” - great. One week later thought I’d catch up! 

It seems like latest thing that’s new learning clotting issues real: they’re likely common adenovirus vectored vaccines, specific certain demographic groups, potentially treatable doctors prepared correctly identify occur.

It’s really unfortunate UK wasn’t forthcoming domestic data; likely could shaved days process, gotten lifesaving information doctors sooner, potentially avoided lot vaccine hesitancy issues we’d information sooner. 

Fortunately, US EMA quite transparent, right safety actions occurring.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Well hit July think unless cases surge areas low vaccination rates given last summers numbers seems unlikely. seriously doubt stores require masks memorial day. think summer hit people like screw mask mandate vaccinated months great news. Pfizer keeps surprising us simply meeting demands pandemic competency vigor. Would 2 billion pay Reddit stay Vegas weekend? see definitive statement needs made early. might situation, case, I'm willing take third shot means continue live normal life, prioritize giving people want vaccine two doses first worrying give boosters to. is, seems like vaccines protect pretty damn well current problematic variants. case, vaccinated also 90% efficiency getting infected. No, doesn't. sign kids camp summer, whereas skipped last summer. done outdoor sports whole time indoor swimming. Playdates outside masked. Colorado blasts ads saying free time, well testing, assumed case states, maybe not... Actually route described was:

1) infected person opened door government employee could collect sample.
2) 50 seconds later, uninfected person hall opened door sampled, became infected via aerosol transmission infected person 

😳 Wasn’t concern shortage medical supplies? thought trying save medical masks medical facilities? There’s huge vaccine glut NYC anyone everyone get vaccine today. means six weeks today everyone wanted vaccine could got fully protected. I’m done I’m participating single restriction anymore. take immunosuppressant 3.5 weeks past vaccine first dose. relieved today Red Cross blood donation showed reactive antibody test (free test, shows app antibodies days processed donation). 

I quite worried would produce enough antibodies detected. don’t know levels someone medication, I’m grateful antibodies there!

My last three blood donations (I donate every 2-3 months) showed COVID antibodies. least knew hadn’t exposed yet.

They test antibodies virus antibodies vaccine. Tbh I'm surprised, suspect one thing that's driving many get shot lifetime they've seen awful diseases like polio measles eradicated US vaccines. Even extremely conservative grandpa got Covid shot immediately dumbfounded antivaxers. Oregon trail taught two dangerous things life dysentery rivers anti-vaxxers, businesses reopening requiring proof vaccine making masks social distancing mandatory. true.
Small businesses also take debt try stay float revenue low. see point though. Caesarean rate may relevant likely different sets people getting Caesareans dying. I've told high Caesarean births due wealthier people made option normal, large percentage population poor continues get inferior medical treatment caesareans. would imagine ones getting Caesareans also access great medical care children become sick, people Caesareans dying large numbers we're seeing, they're poor high allopathic load lifetime poor treatment great access care get sick. infant mortality rate among poor Brazil also significant there's Covid. think that's fair paraphrase said that's going for! asked them, said no. course could drag front labor court maybe even win. contract renewed I'd job months. man, politicians making baseless shit attack Brits, bury ""european nationals"" /s dont know got downvoted, knowing speed vaccination here, dont expect everyone get second dose july, way I’m curious 52% antibodies weren’t infected. hope someday learn people get others don’t.    8 5! Thankfully preexisting conditions  Haha, broken promises like :) Well obviously I'm listening doctor flying without vaccine really give guidance anything else. Playdates, road trips, camps.... get job nearest Walmart.

There cashiers future. Stocking, warehouse, delivery done robots, drones, people chronic injuries. Going back schools 40's 50's compete young people low wages losing battle. may painkillers rest life.

If trades get injured, life basically over.  understand mask hate work made wear paper mask office. I've always worn comfortable cloth ones cut fit face, mind those. kids even forget get home school. paper ones much uncomfortable. literally rules things English translation. city sealed month. choice, allowed go become superspreaders. Dumb question - Canada actually collect fines people obviously foreigners? understand he's really smart person. actually wanted see exact quote, seen anything far matches headlines. 

I'm sure he's using knowledge experience make educated guess, know he's much much qualified make that. 

But since, uses word likely, seems information make definitive statement whether required right now. point ultimately scientists research give final answer whether required. Probably research that's done Pfizer now. 

Since CEO one company selling potential booster shots, could see may come across potential conflict interest, even fact case (I reason believe is). 

I'm also aware interview gave quote went. I'm sure said voluntarily maybe asked leading question. 

Sorry, mean come across know anyone, let along CEO large drug manufacture. US hasn’t really done enough make clear vaccine free. It’ll really help vaccine hesitancy think would mitigate reduced vaccination progress come towards end. got J&amp;J March, knew free browsing sub, nobody person actually told shot already arm handed card. friend got first Moderna today, bragging got free work (government employee) like “yeah... it’s free everyone” felt way shot...and 10 hours later thought arm gonna fall off. young get Biontech Moderna

*too old don’t really think issue NYT reported article today given study published yesterday.

I think issue public health messaging last year focused staying home much possible should’ve educating people maintain health balancing risks. We’re discussing rather year ago conversation could’ve made difference. Remember last summer news orgs published misleading pictures crowded beaches evidence beachgoers killing grandmas? Turns out, people probably protecting health (sunlight, exercise) posing little risk others. 

It’s issue particular study—it’s way whole conversation handled leaders media. debate had, wasn’t had. we’re discussion right finish line. Warranted. figured much. I’ll wipe steering wheel, door handles gear shifter &amp; dash F it, iI won’t overdo it. Thanks. Pfizer applied, sure Moderna. Masks provide mediocre protection person wearing mask.

Masks provide lots protection people around person wearing mask.

This everything kids, kid wearing mask way effective protecting people people wearing masks. need job. Medicaid. without jobs low income competitive private insurance plans. without jobs right now, smart, saved damn money, kids pay them, unemployment rolling in. sucks really unfortunate, people perfectly fine prepare.

The American system great, I'm tired people thinking absolute disaster even smallest ailment. best doctors world, unfortunately premium that. also often ridiculous wait times see doctors found countries public healthcare.

And actually, get hernia surgery next month planning really pay off. fuck point getting then? exercise effectively home, even without gym. what's stopping people exercising. 2nd shot Wednesday, tad achy sore yesterday, feel 100% today. age group, currently infinite... bullet found yet. similar data saw earlier UK, one dose Biontech efficacy hospitalisations deaths around 80%-85% . wonder second dose make substantial difference. million Q2 Makes sense long term. See overuse antibiotics. 

Thanks. fully agree you. would handy diplomacy tool share US allies. That's happens ban exports vaccines, Europa exported 70 million. I've heard Sweden really terrible Covid response, really surprising. Good thing grandma got vaccinated though :) something called challenge trial purposefully expose groups normally used things like common cold likely cause serious illness know treat well.

With dangerous diseases like covid, measles, polio rabies unethical purposefully infect someone chance death long term symptoms. Along fact really know treat covid beginning pandemic trials started(and still learning). chance participants dying high.

So ran observation trial instead, control (placebo) test group participants carry normal lives report get disease not. wait predetermined number people report infection (predetermined prevent trial stopped early show better results). analyse many group infected work efficacy vaccine, efficacy high enough trial successful apply approval.

With diseases trials take years, many people get infected rabies year, covid *gestures vaguely everything* chance infection *much* higher, predetermined number infections reached earlier.

Edit: early pandemic people suggesting running challenge trial covid vaccines, challenge trials faster, deemed unethical reasons above. sources that? keep people saying don’t know long term effects kids won’t wanna open it’s scaring want things normal. pls don’t downvote Thats nothing!
Here SA done 300k 50M. mental, it?

Pretty sure they've gotten rid blackouts streaming deep cable channels.

NBC coverage great days. complaints decade ago they've addressed lot concerns.

The biggest complaint 2018 actually trying show much live events possible: ""They switched away Sean White's celebration fast."" point, can't please everyone thing people going find something complain about. opinion? Yes. far left, must warn you. 

Merkel really pro business cost drove workers poor people every chance possible. ruthless Greece 2008 crisis, force submission. Germany, european standards, conservative country workers poor people little support. 

Just example politics Trump ends doing, good manners calm tone, Germany still uses shitloads dirty coal electricity generation. Activists go protest expanding coal mines get arrested. Macron, way, master sending police beat shit protesters. 11 people died Yellow Vest protests. comparison, dead Hong Kong protests 2.

[The EU set 100 millionth vaccine earlier week, far we've exported 113 million doses countries outside (Britain, Canada, Japan...).

Per capita, [US vaccinated roughly two times many people EU would exported vaccines, would rate vaccination US right now.

Again, trying salty whatever; trying explain case. Like said, people actually get vaccine, we'll need wear masks. individual fully vaccinated thing population vaccinated rates need reduce community transmission low levels (like 1-2:100,000 7 days running, let's say). 

Seems like seem think smarter CDC. I'll stick guidance guidance changes could many months. Lol got em mine.

As yesterday's data, think 28.8% men state least one dose versus 35.5% women. Fuck W.H.O IIRC idea ""passports"" comes concerns certificate normally issued could easily forged. authenticated, quickly easily. living politician doesn’t mRNA vaccines made scratch either. developed SARS MERS, changed payload COVID.

There's little reason think mRNA payload would weird effect kids. know rest vaccine's components since tested SARS MERS shots. last comment posted link showed evidence Pfizer vaccine 94% effective asymptomatic infection

You cannot transmit covid aren’t even asymptomatically infected covid

For info, highly recommend Twitter page Dr. Monica Gandhi,(@MonicaGandhi9) UCSF infectious disease doc made table linked. She’s really really good summarizing explaining info around this, much reliable, informed, unbiased source news articles this. explain better authoritatively would thing fucked up, bad. fucked much more. Oh well, wait either Gottkanzler Söder, getting Kruzifix, Bundeszanzlerin Laschet get dice politics. Pfizer vaccine applied BLA yet?

Has Moderna vaccine applied BLA yet?

If not, idea happen? pace vaccinations going rate delivery vaccines, think good portion people get second doses 4 months up. I'm 20 closing second shot end next week. But, also went state worse rollout mine stay parent, allowed jump ahead line compared I'd home state, group based priority state take longer achieve herd immunity? Undoubtedly. school trying force us back onto campus without vaccines, feel forced unethical decision concern health, safety, financial wellbeing. Glad could personally part 200M milestone yesterday! 💉 5.800 infected 74 died. Thats death rate received vaccination. Johnson Johnson? Overreaction CDC warranted? frankly obvious needs stated regularly. everyone knows exercise correlates health terms immune system health. people think dieting drink diet coke instead regular. amazed average person know. Funny thing I'm actually Canadian lol. thought downgraded moved here, guess living America perks. lmao, many empty chambers revolver have? US stockpile AZ one thing continues annoy me. Export literally anyone please. even donate it. Countries ordered waiting company fulfill order. using it. likely going approve vaccine. rate vaccines becoming available, people US even want approve it.

How many millions AZ doses sitting around ""just case"" additional millions ""just case"" vaccines already available?

(Not meaning direct you, course. mentioned stockpile reminded me) Canada pretty much EU country. things similarly, good unfortunately bad too. hope everyone getting vaccinated do.

Most people seem watched decade. plenty live events seen.

Yes, NBC creates packaged 3 hour show prime time depending time zones, may contain lot tape delayed stuff.

In case 2018 Winter Olympics, though, LOT live stuff time zones worked well.

Virtually everything going show tape delayed prime time obtained live one channels via online streaming.

Most redditors cable cuts options, across family networks streaming, NBC routinely top charts terms many total hours shown.

I, too, fan NBC broadcasters opening ceremony, NBC ""unfiltered"" version air watch opening ceremony. news always distorted scientific research sweet, sweet views/clicks.

“Could coffee/red wine/steak add four years life? 11!”

Two weeks later: “Is coffee/red wine/steak killing speak? 11!”  Doesn’t disprove AZ’s claim 4/1,000,000 getting blood clots competitors? exactly hundreds cases haven’t reported? Public schools’ enrollment dropped lot desperate lose students want provide option. doubt, follow money. wish well... maybe/hopefully allergies?! Third world country much Poland getting? per capita EU? Poland getting proportion mRNA vaccines? Thanks!!! schools reopened kids get shots there. #Murica I'm incredibly envious also happy you! insane many vaccines produced right Belgium (Pfizer, AZ, J&amp;J) barely any. They're still vaccinating +65 risk groups (diabetes, obesity,..). It’s island nation that’s tightly integrated global economy depends heavily trade, means people passing similar experience except nothing would let sleep. tired sleep.

Finally around 8pm next night, took NyQuil dozed 13 hours hah.

Felt almost completely normal next day except heart burn reason. Still dealing heartburn (but GERD) I've talking gastroenterologist I'm sure coincidence. would help Canada offered AZ vaccines sitting US waiting vaccine approved. synthesizing research studies cited bottom. studies published scientific journals peer-reviewed. one three: disagree studies, that's prerogative. Stating opinion differs, implying research papers lying without providing evidence, certainly convince anybody else there's valid reason disagree findings. simple photo showing vaccination certificate.

That moment realise controversy around vaccine passports country could avoided they'd given everyone certificate got jab, instead belatedly trying create system certifying recipients fact. Walmart work opened last weekend, I'm ready drink it. part vaccines apparently expensive initally agreed upon - I'll never understand politicians said ""Nope, expensive."".. spend billions unnecessary stuff every year like big macs though they're fluff lol

Fuck I'll get tacos Bloomberg vaccine tracker Doin gods work 🙏 support vaccination, need understand reason separate trial kids there's still possibility could cause issues.

Although, could getting COVID. change want see world tell vast VAST majority un-vaccinated right bat think initial pause reasonable delaying next Friday Wuhan also welded people inside homes. CCP surveillance apparatus law enforcement much stronger see West. pesky “democracy” keeps getting way perfect enforcement. LA pushed back 2032, California's High Speed Rail line might actually complete time olympics rolls around. believe current completion target 2029.  I’m sure you’d able swing think NH allow staters vaccine originally scheduled day UK suggested people 30 AZ vaccine. appointment saw midwife head nurse (due pregnant) decided I'd come back pfizer vaccine instead. Honestly cannot fault UK's vaccination effort all. even vaccinated midwife hand. Technically reduced production Puurs site Belgium. surge new Marburg facility Germany started rolling doses. sites massive production capacity though. suggest 3 week dosing regime optimal. Since then, widely agreed different dosing regime gives better protection?  I’ve seen what’s happening kids US it’s nothing. CDC reports fewer 300 kids age 17 died this. Compared 30,000 died causes period. reached new level insanity. quite per capita since vaccines ordered initially last year disagreement much order vaccine. EU end came system countries could decide much would want vaccine. countries went heavy AZ bit bind right now, like Bulgaria example. That's 10m doses BionTech get delivered ahead schedule added 5 countries got screwed worst AZ shortfalls. 

Idk Poland ordered yeah exactly per capita. 

Also know always easy blame ordering BionTech time orders AZ looked great AZ costs less 1€ per dose BionTech goes 15.50€ vaccinating whole EU population AZ would around 850m€ BionTech would cost around 14b €, EU ordered even BionTech turned bad AZ would better sure people would cry EU wasting money. get deck stacked them. amount misinformation partisan tribes leading people make decisions wouldn’t well informed pitted other. Also, many people die may immunocompromised vaccine didn’t work, otherwise compromised. hear you’re saying I’m willing binary it.  Well, messaging awareness spread still majorly wash hands wear masks. untill seeing article reddit thread, still thought contact transmission main thing responsible. denied shot insurance state. wonder that's issue facing. got mine Cali today! Took 20 mins including post-vaccination observation period. one : guys created Seinfeld! friend leukemia, bone marrow transplant. get re-vaccinated everything already vaccinated kid. Try another location. Nobody asking insurance. ID county health departments. following current recommendations scientific community relevent regulatory authorities fan flames. News agencies misrepresenting facts did. German vaccine commission initially recommend vaccine age group 65+ company submit enough data show actually works age group. Merkel went along recommendation news agencies reported ""GeRManY ThInkS AZ wORk 65 yEAr OLds!!!1111!!""
After AZ included participants 65+ study submitted data, German regulators saw burden proof satisfied changed recommendations. cutting corners.
Throughout process Merkel change stance once. think beginning, many Americans wanted hear sort presidential-sounding leadership. his...unique appeal...Trump never exactly projected expertise. think many us latched onto Cuomo giving daily press conferences. (Who could forget late night hosts called “Cuomosexual?”) think it’s people fell cult personality around Fauci. think many people latched onto European leadership.

Overreaction. definitely investigated, point stop vaccines investigated. think necessary, fine.
Mocking people taking precautions feel safe, lame. They’re also likely know someone died COVID help. know, pandemic, mutations around globe problem. Nationalism help, exporting splitting stuff best do.

 Additionally single life countries worth less mine anyone else. matter someone one side getting vaccinated, long people getting vaccinated. camps mandate post-travel quarantine kids? one problem booking travel right now, even though risk perspective low.

Dare see normal canada day? Thatd pretty daring 🤔 don’t even think hindsight. think certainly people Germany, France , elsewhere knew EC hence EU absolutely Deep shit AZ ran problems. 

Yes, agree like minded EU countries definitely cooperated build capacity fast possible. whole rich vs poor EU countries red herring, key making enough stuff, energy focused, damned politics turned waste time.

Indeed, ramping industrial capacities key. countries partners companies produce vaccines ...the EC acted big customer, crazy. know covid domestic animals?

Anyone thoughts if/when CDC updates travel quarantine guideline non-eligible children fully vaccinated families? current guidelines difficult families travel since kids (in theory) quarantine school/camp/daycare/etc week afterwards. Given relatively low transmission among children seems like overkill. even sillier live state much higher case rates state country travelling to! Like said, tough decision parents even numbers low risk getting mis-c still low. People kids tend put possibly harmful conditions although data needed risk minimal hard sell get people jump new vaccine trial. many adults wanted get that? many people rejecting vaccine now? going require lot smart messaging accomplish hope safely. trials, see cautious demonized either. Why? 

70% usage, real world 90% effectiveness, including school age children wear masks current vaccines authorized - that's math herd immunity.

Medical experts calling widespread N95 plain ""better masks"" now.  really hope Gottkanzler Söder become meme CEO, incidentally veterinarian, every get Covid vax?

I seem remember rolling out, made excuse backed getting it.  part “I got vaccine” understand? That’s whole point getting vaccine right? stuff again. I’m responsible other’s actions, own. Every day passes, proportion people died totally preventable death grows higher higher.

If people dying actively choose get vaccinated, that’s totally them. I’m losing minute sleep them. good afterlife! UK largely delayed second dose 3 months data probably available while. Though clear, EUA still *tons* safety data. COVID vaccines gone preclinical testing, three phases clinical trials external review two independent panels experts two civil service scientific reviews. 

[Here's Know COVID-19 Vaccines Safe | Houston Methodist 

So despite efforts, see safety issue (say \~1/1,000,000 blood clots J&amp;J vaccine) generally FDA Approval vs. FDA EUA. stuff rare safety trial could caught it. probably still gonna required wear mask tbh. expect venues drop mask requirements want look like they're helping.

Unless outdoors maybe? light treason? draw line. Lockdowns we're waiting vaccine one thing, someone vaccinated waited two weeks full protection, health orders longer apply them. might try contacting local health department wherever you’re staying explain situation. may able direct place give vaccine. vaccinated mass vaccination clinic run health department neighboring county, ask worked (due certain professions prioritized vaccines time), never asked *proof* employment proof health insurance. didn’t even ask ID, although I’ve heard drug stores do, apparently. did. turned away. going there?

Here CA offered choice clinic brand vaccine myturn site. certainly hurt think reality month take masks whole thing starts again. Smart usage N95 masks hot spots might kept low enough required time getting work. Ontario (15,500,000 pop) cases 50 day last summer. overwhelmed. needs constant battle vaccinated. Nah, I'm looking forward licking toilets again.  know safe... norway low prevalance taking vaccine quite close risk hospitalization covid 50...  idea people going get issues exactly issue...

it's weird.. something weird science go investigate it.. causing people get sick pause evaluate it... people suggesting could give half dosage mitigate young people... that's great.. people said manufacturing defect... know numbers continue jabbing people?

Ok ok, take breather. clearly “if saves one life” train. I’m sorry guy got cancer. don’t wish anyone. guy clearly didn’t get insurance though, safeguards losing money. insurance? Well would 50% chance vaccine, better nothing. Many Russians want vaccine COVID.. Unfortunately, country, combination different factors influences this:
First, still many believe COVID consider mild disease therefore consider necessary vaccinated. meet peoples city every day. Many aggressive point view.
Second group anti-vaxxer principle, vaccinations, believe reliable vaccine takes years testing therefore afraid vaccines COVID exist world now, since created extreme conditions passed short tests opinion.
Third group consists ones ready get vaccinated, relaxed passing peak second wave epidemic Russia therefore postpone time time..  Yeah. I'm going look options area. hope like experiences I'm hearing online walk get questions asked. they're appointment here, even Walgreens. gotta keep trying.  headline asks question answer no.

In last weeks, we've seen number states PLENTY vaccines. Percentages shots distributed going rather up, day walk appts becoming increasingly available. Everyone's eligible almost every state week two people want shot likely gotten one. 

While projection ""enough everyone end May"" might still accurate, lot signs pointing fact enough everyone wants one right now.

I'm sorry hard top everything else. Absolutely. 50% frontline healthcare workers much higher exposure risk viral load. Sinovac vaccine worldwide specifically tested group.

That's quite jump starting AZ due lack data going mixed vaccinations data.

It likely mixed vaccinations provide even better protection double either vaccine, still interesting see sudden change methods.

How long Brazil news covid horror story? Seems like entire pandemic. know deaths/mil actually US Europe?

Probably Brazil painted horror story year. You’d think much worse wherever live, chances they’re actually better. vaccine even expensive produce, compare mRNA vaccines? change actual facts requirements. Closer get, better. Herd immunity boolean toggle. covid's flu. straw man testing isn’t artificial barrier. It’d artificial barrier didn’t tests got Cal. Unfortunately do. they’re much harder SATs depending major. 

Who woulda thunk they’d still give tests stop using tests drive admissions? Florida we've schools open completely entire year. 5 children ages 5-14 died none associated school AFAIK (feel free link shred evidence otherwise). We've millions children state getting good education little downside. Yeah, that's we're worried :/ frustrating someone who's careful whole time whole group vaccinated control. Yes! That’s exactly people sub don’t seem understand.  fair lot overtime, definitely start there, motivation going unconventional locations work, attainable! Generally higher paying positions ones find listed job listing sites well.  Ones ability trig impact ones ability succeed college. not, countries used export controls block private countries fulfilling countries contracts.

The EU could done us too, haven't. Headache sore arm. get migraines often sure headache vaccine. Exactly, reason confuse people. ok, 'very good'. Preventing hospitalisations 80s decent. lower symptomatic levels put much larger requirement total Vaccinations herd immunity.  year people still think ""But loved one(s) personally high risk getting seriously sick/dying Covid?"" 

It's pandemic. yours. reaching herd immunity us. we're going need vaccinate lot kids get there, otherwise virus going keep percolating children, people can't get vaccinated whatever reason, people weakened immune systems, people get vaccinated work them, etc. 

And whole time going mutating, possibly growing better breaking vaccinated population.

The way end pandemic reach herd immunity vaccinating many people can, hitting adults, calling day, hoping best. way get kids vaccinated test vaccines kids. Someone's gotta it. 

I wish trial near us. I'd sign kids heartbeat. them, everyone. Waiting longer necessary getting kids vaccinated prolonging pandemic needlessly. trials, get data, make sure vaccines safe efficacy high EVERYONE, get rugrats jabs ASAP.

It's fastest, best way actually ""get back normal"" yet many people loudly clamoring normalcy ASAP willing steps necessary get us properly ""they're tired it"" scared vaccines whatever. 

So instead they'll half-ass measures, give reach herd immunity, shrug act confused pandemic drags on. Cool cool.  100% correct. Public financing sport enrich smarmy asshloes awful policy (see FIFA, IOC, U.S. Sports Leagues, etc.). please source.... Stop acting like people saying end point. point cases low good majority people fully vaccinated. get vaccinated.   numbers positive cases US don’t represent true numbers. It’s thought upwards 1/3 US covid. state? I'm full vaxxed, NJ, still like well. I'm pretty sure mostly urban areas too, getting anywhere near shipments getting deal demand. work retail store also wear KN95. run orders outside, get physically sweaty it. mask compounds issue gets uncomfortable. gym, running treadmill terrible mask on. Indoor dining isn’t possible mask, don’t it. Mask wearing restrictive makes feel claustrophobic times. can’t wait I’m fully vaccinated low chance getting covid low risk spreading it. Life go back normal. Yeah 7-day average deaths less 2 people. cares infections? deaths matter. exercise could put pill would destroy supplement industry. Feels like waste we’re almost thing actually said think planning purposes, planning purposes only, think expect may boost. think risks fully understood always? many times patient given drug combination drugs trials evaluate risk combination. happens time medicine. doctors allowed that? light measures masks certain indoor spaces could last even less

I know mean ""certain indoor spaces"", but:

(1) flu season last 2-3 months - last closer 6 (starts late fall continues April/May);

(2) flattening curve make last less long - makes last longer. That's flattening curve works. We're talking ebola reason? Yes, knowledge Ebola infectious even single viral particle likely spread disease. yes, absolutely get ebola someone ebola sneezes blood mouth.

Edit : pastor saying blood sneezed mouth, neither parties ebola systems, magically create ebola? Oh lawdd. local nature center lot community work actually imagine they'll follow rules pretty closely. They've careful everything entire year. everything kids. masking kids helps prevent vulnerable kids getting sick. Masking offers protection wearer, bulk protection preventing wearer spreading virus others — work aggregate, it’s like personal air filter. understand efficacy numbers work. people talking could potentially unlimited exposures given conducting lives. anyone putting risk one break cases, them. said aren’t talking seeing them, seeing people exposed them, uncertain position right. honest, know also degree moral judgement behavior individuals pre post vaccination, I’m trying let cloud judgement. remember American watching Merkel last year awe, intelligent discussing virus way poliiticians due background, remember thinking ""dam they're lucky, definitely this."" weird waking news like fairly frequently situation played differently imagined there.

I really hope Europe get vaccinated asap, really need help. people don’t want vaccine them. confine restrictions every anti vax shot Bolsonaro Genocida Serious question: Why? don’t worry dude it’s gonna make difference you’ll ever notice. Sorry hear you’re nervous tho, hope sleep better tonight! almost like remove artificial barrier entry disproportionately negativity affects POC, rates POC acceptance goes up. woulda thunk Hahaha wow, I’m going public health experts country saying. propaganda. sure everything political you. Ah, right. Thanks catching that. Edited. public wedding? would think places hosting wedding/reception point want thing much anybody else.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ahh, gotcha! thought dropped 'm' end 'the'. Putting quotes around ""you know"" clarifies it. Also Colorado almost 1900 new cases yesterday, it’s trending up, it’s level early January... 60% vaccination (at least one shot). technically calculations 1/2 January. rate transmission slowing, it’s increasing reasons aren’t totally clear anyone yet... that’s I’m saying, doesn’t feel like adds totally I’m getting first dose next Tuesday assuming there’s shortages, I’ll likely fully vaccinated first week June.

I’m praying there’s shortages next weeks.  many. depends upon outdoor activity question. People passing sidewalk short exposure there's minimal risk. contrast, large group people area long period time, concert stadium, even open air there's still enough viral particles floating infect others. Obviously, still safer hold event outside hold indoors, certain point extra ventilation enough mitigate risk. it, blows mind people bent knee schools. 'Study finds' - many years study? Yeah don’t think solid logic. I’m honestly glad went route seperate locations. one made easy people motrivayed knowledgeable get appointments basically everyone know fully vaccinated lol. importantly made appointments go quick possible. Waiting lists put work site book appointments whereas releasing appointments puts work individual. think big reason NJ high supply administered partially high demand also decentralized system. Thank that! wish trial close enough enroll kids. feel like I'm suffocating physical activities mask on. Live one best friends spent lot home gym. lifesaver. Lost lot weight shape I've ever been! don’t need “fully vaccinated.” need 70% number herd immunity start working favor. us halfway terms overall doses given thus far, higher terms number people received one shot plan getting second soon. Scare-mongering helpful. risk remains low. heard before? I’m concerned mostly potential long Covid. Right now, risk tolerance see vaccinated adults, kids see vaccinated adults indoors know continuing avoid around potentially unvaccinated people indoors, anyone going indoor restaurants traveling Florida, Texas states dropped mask mandates indoors seeing kids indoors. 

This specific situation tricky isn’t seeing people engaged see high risk activity would see kids. It’s someone otherwise cautious would see people engaging high risk behavior. 

FWIW, don’t know anyone else engaging level 2019 style life people are, couple pandemic ignoring people removed life months ago, isn’t larger wide spread issue life. It’s literally one group people concern. Nothing guarantees immunity. Getting covid, getting vaccinated protects lessens effect you. booked ~a week ago (5-6 days planning open appointments age groups). able get mine Stanford Health app. brother used SCC site booked via Levi. friends traveled bit (Davis / Santa Rosa).

I anything special, periodically check Stanford Health app times day. I'm sure appointment slots released, see availability change checked. end day, many countries choice Sinovac nothing. countries luxury mRNA. chinese vaccine far global impact Pfizer Moderna. Overall cases still going down, age groups (11-14 30-35?) went little bit. bad many feared.  guessing US seen vigilance. rough calculations saw basically said impact JJ 2 weeks. EU think announced going Pfizer future. countries Pfizer/Mederna widely available probably terrible prolong pandemic. Oh 100%, like don’t believe China’s. saying graph OP posted goes point, it’s also useful comparing one country’s rates combined rates 50 separate countries. respiratory though? blood disease. Consider entirety symptoms issues post covid. Organ/heart/clots. understand saying failing take account diminishing covid numbers come adult vaccination increased success treating covid now. 271 covid running completely unmitigated. Number nearly high adults vaccinated, plus treatments reducing deaths drastically. 

Also wearing masks thing comes mask mandate. Restaurants suddenly safe eat at, can't mask eat. Concerts go, many people crowded place. goes thing sit home walk around block get out. 

If incentivize vaccine allowing freedom get it, going large chunk population think worth get it, like now. Seriously, kids fine. I'm biased, that's why. Severe back pain back muscle cramps next two days. 

My advice, tylenol ready. 7 billion people never fully immunized. living covid out, new variants make current vaccines useless everyone continue getting new vaccines every year, carry 50/50 shot knocking ass. 

It’s anecdotal, reading peoples reactions Reddit hearing least dozen people know throwing diarrhea 4-5 days afterwards, seems pretty terrible. reactions outliers, norm. people also saying wouldn’t get another shot would make feel like again, lends validation theory covid never going away. It’s “mild flu like symptoms” many, it’s taken commission vaccine might moot 6 months...

Again, hope I’m totally wrong works I’m skeptical plays out. minimum, we’re distancing wearing masks next year two anyway. read days ago, idea vaccine rollout recent/slow. still wear mask vaccine live guidance changes, polite nobody knows I've vaccine literally easiest thing world show kindness respect. wear store work day long, coworkers vaccinated without complaint. that's original Covid variant terrible, that's Kent variant ok-ish. That’s cost per year private schools, semester. But, agreed, it’s prohibitively expensive. weather brilliant poor getting scholarships afford it. Everyone else either foolish taking loans stretching family finances chance price paper elite name it, really good it’ll pay off. Yes! I'm way second punch bow...oh darn, already empty. know, something still understand. ""Low"" mean ""Low"", low enought two-week opening followed two months lockdown ffs. see you’re saying *really* think that’s likely? 

Let’s use 26 million population Australia. Given number different vaccines, small portion would get AstraZeneca, let’s assume get vaccine. 

Now let’s use EU/UK numbers. Australians experience complications vaccine rate EU, 148 people might reaction die. 

In months Australia locked down, since, 910 people died COVID. assume similar numbers lockdowns ease people aren’t vaccinated. 

The way scenario people die vaccine Covid could true everyone gets vaccine (unlikely) Australia stays locked indefinitely (unlikely). seem informed article lacks details. limiting raw materials specifically. Thanks. “completely” defeat purpose. speaking least it’s blocking droplets launching face bop nose. specific rare blood clot disorder called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis

Same exact type clot present Moderna/Pfizer trials. one looking forward inevitable documentary shit-show, whether goes not. compare two different situations? Flu without safety measures (other flu vaccine) vs covid full safety measures? 

What think would happened shutdown school? think number covid deaths among children would increased far current level? See example what's going Brazil. Way Russian numbers. Especially compare excess deaths country versus reported Coronavirus deaths. US probably underreporting little. Russia probably underreporting massive amount. sure voted, actually quite plausible. least deserves scrutiny. BetaMax entered room That's told winter. get better like month two. bad again. stop =( Couldn’t imagine going PI pandemic. place disgusting sickness went back 2006 without major worldwide pandemic. Pneumonia cellulitis place. would 1986. hoping he's reading ;).  
 
  irresponsible sad festival happening now.

 
I'm afraid stopping it. checked profile, looks like 95%+ comments talking-up China various threads. spend much time defending government platform literally banned said government? No. average person previously 1.5% chance dying got Covid, chance dropped (at least) 80%, looking 0.3% versus 1.5% unvaccinated population. Pfizer/Moderna levels, reduction welcome. Here's little inventory.

Currently receiving 2.5 doses week. figure set increase 3.4 week starting week Apr 26, 5.1 doses week last five weeks quarter (starting end May).

In total, receive 50 doses Q2, that's increase 10 compared initial plans. extra doses early delivery Q3 doses EU (10 doses EU, Germany receives almost 2 donates 0.5 poorer EU countries initial low BioNTech order), early delivery 50 Q4 doses EU recently announced, Germany receives 9 M.

Additionally, receive 8 doses Moderna Curevac Q2.

That's total almost 60 doses mRNA vaccine delivered Germany Q2. 

Since second doses given 6 weeks first, deliveries amount 40 people receiving least one dose Q2.
Together 10 Q1, that's 60 % population receiving least one dose end June *even Astrazeneca J&amp;J completely scrapped deliveries now*.

Since think expect get least half promised doses AZ J&amp;J actually delivered people's arms (given run 60 year-olds month now), think herd immunity three months even sooner realistic.

Those legit complaints would extremely petty keep doses need people vaccinated countries trying prevent another massive surge. Yeah probably know CEO 😂 I'd sign kid heartbeat...have seen what's happening brazil kids contract covid? need end pandemic kids play huge role transmission. forget picture profile posted male fashion advice, showing white male? Quit bullshit definitely promoted idea media. “Soft lockdowns work!” reality headlines read “Japan lucking right now”  friend teaches north Texas school district even covid. Program called EHigh, used kids sick medical leave (broken leg, illness, etc) kids transportation issues. working quite well.

I'd rather go teargas chamber get another dose shot. vacine coronavac, one lowest safety rate, still Pfizer. sucks. hoping number 200 million. figured would balloons confetti.

Think I'll day two late. reporting people get vaccine still get COVID? know reporting channel issues vaccines, seems like tracking effectiveness population vaccine. Love conservatives blatantly try rewrite history change narratives. Trump's admin shut White House Pandemic response team. throughout February 2020 kept claiming control, new cases getting US (a lie), repeatedly ignored advice National Security advisor, CDC, etc. several months ignored warnings started securing vaccine contracts, ordering supplies like masks PPE, etc. can't rewrite history think people around wedding guy. Yes is, say risk lower even risk factors. Follow inconsistent logic here: you’re admitting kids suck testing, aren’t academically ready, trouble basic life skills. going succeed college? Right, developing countries years. That's point. Yeah, cancelled...not fucking happening...no Olympics Japan...for awhile concerning thing 1st world countries likely hoard doses preparation 3rd dosing instead donating ""extra"" supplies countries need scientist, baffling ignore data like this. US Sweden drastically loosened restrictions never even any, yet Germany creating restrictions. Meanwhile, death rates 3 countries within similar range past 6 months. lockdowns going fix anything, harm everyone's mental cant get hurt covid. 56% asymptomatic. chosen take AZ BioNtech give Germans confidence. federal ministers chosen BioNtech. best studies (the UK Israeli studies) show mNRA vaccines around 90%-95% effective full vaccination. bad t-cell research isn’t slightly easier. bet find protection bit longer. evidence 2 year old’s significant covid vector?  Nope, definitely risk.

I hate notion I’m brown, family everyone around infinite potential waiting unleashed shackles racist society creates inequities none naturally. ain’t true. people gonna fail getting Cal regardless race. needs ok. Certainly. 

There study done Oxford University compared risk CVT AZ vaccine vs. Pfizer Moderna found risk same. AZ, may know, paused Europe concern J&amp;J US: analysis real-world data collated global health research network TriNetX European agencies included information hundreds thousands people either caught COVID-19, given AstraZeneca, Pfizer Moderna shots. data mRNA-type vaccines, American drugs, U.S., data AstraZeneca shots came largely Europe's mass-vaccination data showed 4 every 1 million people get American-made vaccines experience cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), blood clots brain. AstraZeneca vaccine, works different way similar Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, research showed incidence rate 5 every 1 million.

Keep mind I'm coming too. risk CVT actual COVID-19 infection FAR greater. risk CVT vaccine small relatively. agree important understand factors lead CVT vaccines, believe researchers getting close, could well related spike proteins another interaction platelets form. agree on, vaccines paused, causing doubt safety lot people process risks well...endangering make choices might lead getting COVID instead, spreading people vulnerable. complex problem, minor risks, vaccination absolutely necessary way get accomplished.

That said, I'll repeat again, discouraging vaccination..just opposite. disagreeing pause helpful vaccines risk...and could lead another problem Pfizer Moderna put scrutiny, people wonder paused risks similar. host issues too, like ones paused smaller players industry likely see significant price increases (both Pfizer Moderna expressed desire raise price vaccines initial phase, whereas AZ pledged keep vaccine cost...and got pushed out). That's different topic entirely, one makes somewhat frustrating seeing governments handling findings. constantly hearing adults around whine masks? mimic so. school made real effort emphasize masks punitive measure. They’re tool allow us gather staying safe. yet hear single child school complaining refusing wear one properly. Glad hear pediatrician page! bunch family Poland (5 aunts/uncles + lots cousins). Prior COVID half considered moving get EU citizenship. dread hearing thing seem hear memes (in polish) COVID fake, masks evil vaccines implanting chips. One aunts seemed genuinely curious thoughts safety vaccines, think ended getting it. sure we're going survive next global catastrophe already started (weaponized stupidity). dont get it. find way uncomfortable wearing like that.

Figuring new things add looking bargains become almost interesting working out. likely Asymptomatic vaccinated people quarantine test per CDC guidelines. Florida open since moved August never looked like closing.  true major cities truths

It's technically true misleading. According current cdc guidelines, anyone fully vaccinated (2 weeks second shot) need quarantine exposure. study researchers Oxford University England suggests risks experiencing dangerous, rare blood clots brain far higher catch coronavirus get either AstraZeneca vaccine, vaccines made Pfizer Moderna U.S. *The research shows number people experience clots getting vaccines made American pharmaceutical giants appears similar number get rare condition shot AstraZeneca drug, developed conjunction Oxford's vaccine institute.*

Emphasis analysis real-world data collated global health research network TriNetX European agencies included information hundreds thousands people either caught COVID-19, given AstraZeneca, Pfizer Moderna sudden.... 

many existing vaccines given ""mixed"" - reason state: BETTER.

&amp;#x200B;

CDC originally opposed.

&amp;#x200B;

**JAN 22 2021**

CDC quietly changes Covid vaccine guidance OK mixing Pfizer Moderna shots ‘exceptional ""year long"" clinical trial going fly right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think there's pretty good chance ""third dose"" vaccine get first time around. think safety big vaccines might give **broader, longer-lasting immunity** virus new variants it, offer **more flexibility vaccine rollout.**

Results first stage expected next month ***expanded*** trial reportable findings June July - although study run year. back studies showed masks actually work come yet.

Yet every doctor wore masks. Even one find n95 wore DIY masks.

Again, precautionary principle. Without data, cautious, less. wear mask disease infected cough least 100 years (Spanish flu, hello?)

Except data

There research cambridge saying masks worked. research 2013.

Here: influenza particle smaller covid particle.

Fauci gave us worst possible answer. could easily recommended homemade masks. doctors never prescribe Tylenol birth control. risks far great.

For vulnerable populations especially, benefits vaccine massively outweigh risks. many (the homeless, home-bound, living remote areas) acces mRNA vaccines. **Withholding vaccines groups harm.** Exactly. Like, difference getting AZ blood clot things going vs waiting week two Pfizer Moderna getting better protection, don’t really blame people waiting American really see often, usually major news situations EA France involved, always got good vibes Merkel though know absolutely nothing her.

Are really ""Trump good manners?"" Genuinely asking, I'd quick summary haha. Vaccinated people don’t spread virus.  One day I'll get trouble muttering, ""your dicks hanging out,"" random woman Costco... No, can’t. possibility variant strains high reach herd immunity, vaccinated people may still spread virus unvaccinated (which includes children right now). Gotta wholesale ban “xyz thing happening, experts say bad thing” headlines poor students much higher chance jobs 17 ,18 boyfriend unable take time due need income, there's higher likelihood get enough sleep night test. Basically, poor students substantially higher barriers order even get test, let alone accurately show intelligence taking it. Im saying it’s impossible, unless provide actual evidence I’m going trust numbers stated. yes, unless proof, you’re making theory conspiracy going on, definition conspiracy theorist, nothing necessarily wrong turns true. not, you’re literally spreading panic Time bust 50 dollar great value gift certificates This. WANT someone tell kids. right saying :outdoor playdates masks (but spoiler alert parents putting kids masks parks, ect). told careful kids take chances; that's it. That's guidance. want live bubble also want reckless children's lives Hmm kids know don’t like masks wear properly parent also pediatrician former virologist , ditto. Hmmmm...are school kids tested twice per week? ages? contact tracing grades 1-6 least. fishing involves row boat absolutely exercise mean EU specifically lobbied companies set hubs EU (because jobs funding) it’s hardly charitable gesture. Tbf remember correctly good chunk hate due U.S. absolutely safety nets citizens, ""literally, survive even help us financially?!"" Remember reading countries getting monthly checks like 70% monthly income every month, even lockdowns? 

I'm saying reasons true, definitely remember big factor early on, Fuck Merkel! used think great chancellor letting refugees explaining science beginning pandemic gone way far work. That’s you’re seeing kids whose parents aren’t worried - rest aren’t gathering. teach elementary school school offered person learning option since fall offered multiple chances parents switch virtual person. little half students still opting virtual, I’m assuming parents concerned. pediatrician? USA CDC virus variant tracker, \~30 states, know 50 states track virus variants? global know many countries tracking virus variants? don’t want survive!!!!! wanna live!!!!! Good luck staying home 1,5 year visiting friends familly. saying like piece cake everyone. People need interactions, following strictly guidlines possible maybe first six months, hard know anyone personally breaking less more. people, unfortunately, never wrap head around this. dramatic twerp. Still delay people getting shot. people prefer J&amp;J vaccine. I’m pretty sure aren’t seeing thing us Brazil. Autopilot: *Give plant!* 🪴 everyone start taking everything damn literally? like collectively lost sense humor definition hyperbole. I'm supposed Ocrevus Multiple Sclerosis, I've putting covid. Since looking like covid may around long time, effective therapies stop tracks would godsend. prefer vaccine domestic passports personally. Irony went heavy festive season continuously decreasing cases. think know went much suddenly increasing sharply without proper study line.

It’s complicated. 

-	The federal president nominating her. 
-	The parliament electing her. 
-	The president parliament finally appoints her. obvious, ""huge populations poor people"" part reason? we've learned anything whole pandemic, public health officials good messaging. turns vaccine 100% effective preventing severe cases. new variants constantly popping Surely thats better clinical trial showed? That's info want. Like clots treatable? Clearly must everyone dying. people advised self monitor certain telltale symptoms seek medical attention show? Seems like information like could go long way improving people's feelings vaccine. Instead ""rare brain blood clot"" sounds horrible. two effective vaccines available Fantastic.

After 2028 games finish, WISH committee would say, “Huh, time.” So? Kids remarkably well either dealing covid even getting it. two kids never worry them. healthy.  best guess people never followed restrictions already caught Covid people engaging highest risk behavior now. anyone curious, sign says “together construct Great Wall immunity” posting e/iamatotalpieceofshit guy said positive covid test going stop going WrestleMania Hope survives court ruling, limiting executive power, actually affect? telling truth causes people skip vaccination, person wasn’t going get vaccinated matter heard.

Science focus truth. Wrong. Bunch Americans got kawasaki thanks covid Definitely agree wave looks like way worse first one I’m one defend EU, eyes blundered quite hard, graphs kinda go you’re saying aren’t population adjusted. Europe whole double population USA, graphs you’ve posted actually show USA higher percentage population effected Covid Europe. you’re gonna dangle carrot front stick, got give us eventually. hurting chances reach herd immunity vaccination. conspiracy theory ... [ lists couple unproven theories, ignoring vaccine trials months successful vaccinations ] People acting like India spared whole pandemic now. averaging 1000 deaths per day months ago pointing that’s case. wave may well worse early data suggests be. I’m sure understand exponential rate increase though. Things “truly exponential” grow fast comparatively much slower (I.e. 1000^x vs 2^x vs 1.00001^x) Eh, seems spread people ones following rules. I'm making complicated thing seem easy, know, really seems like solution offer alternative vaccine people age group concern (women 30, think). 

Be front risks, likelihood risks, alternatives exist, let folks make informed decision. COVID active jogger. Man sucked. I’m still dealing issues it, end December. Wait doesn’t entirely affect math though. mainly affects proposes solution he’s using limit length Covid exposure risk... read thread till end? made pretty good point addendum. baseline rate vaccine induced thrombotic cascades entirely new entity didn’t exist before? Covid19 vaccine. Rated Teen. widely available everyone

Not kids mean, Chancellor also appointed president technically.  Yeah im done since last semester. Im gonna rockstar company (US based) asked could/would moving jobs permanently remote people thinking relocating places US that's possible we're going back office point. told EU specific rules/regulations remote jobs US have. Apparently US, arbitrarily decide job remote that's it. EU re-classify job somehow part include specific pay home office costs anyone working home. involves changing payroll system changing they're handling jobs accounting side apparently big hassle. end result big hassle EU they'd want something like across board probably happen. misinformation. proven fast rollout UK (including millions AZ jabs) objectively saved 1000s lives.

I make exact argument, reluctance endorse AZ vaccine price unlucky blood clot victims invariably lead increased death disease. Good important vaccine hesitancy especially Astra Zeneca. much it’ll actually help another question. IIRC, part made LA's bid 2028 good mix great existing infrastructure new buildings already designated purpose games.

LA ghost town abandoned structures games like we've seen places like Rio Athens. Yes. 

Can stop pingponging take basic safety precautions get past fucking pandemic? problem mild inconvenience wearing mask major inconvenience keeping 3 kids school means put past us.

This back forth “it’s flu” nonsense prolongs pandemic. getting from? Kids still pretty darn safe virus. They’ve already said new variant there. It’s pretty laughable P.1 still cause narrative mainstream media though (and no, don’t usually bash time propaganda). new one called N.10 similar mutations like P.3, different however, ORF7b - thought come older bat coronavirus. considered ORF7b contained Portugal/Spain early 2020. appears come back variant. Studies suggest causative agent heart arrhythmias, nervous system malfunction, lung/bowel complications, epithelial disorders. COVID-19 antibodies one-fifth risk getting COVID again, compared didn’t antibodies.

The headline could ""COVID antibodies provide 80% protection, good several vaccines"" instead, would click that? gives fuel people advocate full re-open masks course, like flu boosters. bring now? hurts case convince people fence get vaccinated. Oh “luck” scientific???

Or maybe safely live like normal without complete total isolation agree. Funny mega billion pharma CEO nation's global health leader. Plenty German 20 year olds also got vaccine Merkel, weird. Saw tweet said, Alternative headline: “vaccine thought 98% effective turns 99.993% effective.” get goal MSM outlets generate clicks poor way establish confidence vaccines. blood clots caused body's response virus? Cytokine storm cause clots? rational *some* people response vaccine would produce similar reaction obviously much lower rate?

I get people seem get clotting vaccines credibly low rate....like essentially 0% VS virus, birth control, surgery, etc etc?

Get it, put vaccines back play media needs stop clock bait scare mongering cases millions millions doses given. Good you. always easy come different opinion raised with. simple restrictions = lower cases restrictions = higher cases. Texas one example among many. California example direction. Late last year imposed draconian restrictions cases increased anyway. unfortunately simple wearing masks. slept 9 hours afternoon day got first shot (I got 9 am), stay vaccination clinic get Benadryl localized skin reaction could barely move arm 2 days. boyfriend mild amount stomach upset, REALLY sore arm day. mom side effects whatsoever, went work immediately shot never skipped beat, even get sore arm. parapro/teaching assistant side effects literally forgot got shot someone asked it. sister slept four days, could barely move aches chills spiked fever almost 105 Tylenol finally kicked brought back down. place way really tell get it. 

We got Moderna, side effects much same. I'm leaving case someone else come looking anecdotes. hope went home relaxed that! [study young adults one-fifth risk subsequent infection compared seronegative individuals**. Although antibodies induced initial infection largely protective, guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation activity immunity subsequent infection. findings might relevant optimisation mass vaccination strategies.

(emphasis added) College always right solution, trade school sometime better choices. Also, college getting prohibitive expensive past two decades. kids got yet getting it. school person year. son danced person year maskless! attended multiple dance competitions shows auditions person year. 

It’s obviously contagious 

And sane Could said vaccine. hasn’t long term studied anyone especially children supposed getting 10 million shots week May? translates first dose adult population start date Olympics JnJ pause seems noticeable effect numbers Despite disinformation campaign, isn’t. Squidward would like word Thank u!! oh ok. Let rephrase that.

Your son entire studio 150 kids incredibly lucky one get covid somewhere spread rest kids group. mean fuck's sake. Live Poland. confirm. We're folk block even wear masks. Comparing masks vaccines absurd. helpful come on... everyone would perfectly fitted N95 time would fine. Sounds realistic. 

Oh vaccines also protect severe disease &amp; death get infected. 

Masks useful perspective. Yes difference tell someone flu much sooner someone covid, thus making choice isolate protect person develops symptoms anywhere 1 4 days person develops symptoms 5 days infected, symptoms appear early 2 days infection late 14 days infection, time range vary.

My point one saying oh god, hide forever, protect weak, they're saying easy solution that's taking precautions society people vaccinated. even much longer now, probably months. 

The lockdown Covid necessary even average person look numbers died immediately it, overflow hospitals, nursing homes, outbreaks factories, etc, conclude wiping thousands (millions really)out. hope remember many died last year far flu ever kills year. lockdown needed. Even non-immune compromised people risk.

I'm saying someone took precautions extremely seriously past year, think lockdowns end soon (I'm Texas, essentially anyway). mean go 'WHEEE cares ways meet middle halfway transition, let's want, risk people suddenly damned!'. think sides need bit compromise soon normal flu majority vaccinated, mutations start lessen, severity viral load caught anyone enough make even immunocompromised person sick all. That's whole point vaccines.  saw something last 24 hours mentioning vaccinated people still spreaders. course CBS, knows really true trying ""extra cautious"" sharing that. 

I thought consensus vaccinated (other % vaccine ineffective for) likely spread. is...is headline want print? That's good want get boosters, want held back based vaccine got.  way wedding prepackaged food. That's deal breaker. That's borderline stupid cause ZERO covid. 

I'd start looking counties asap. find one, see entice business discounting deposit/payment plan whatever.

If not, I'd eat deposit, way betting stupid policy makers reverse soon. Exactly this, didn’t even know surface transmission first started. We’ve learned much forget much never knew beginning. like you. One randomly selected person Tokyo think general guideline hold taking Tylenol Advil start feeling symptoms. 100% certain recommendations may pregnancy. wouldn’t hurt give doctor’s office OBGYN call advice. really. AFAIK AstraZeneca live vector vaccine real genetic data coronavirus, pfizer body produce spike protein.

This means although make memory antibodies kill COVID, might different mechanisms part virus destroy. i’m expert, need data. It’s interesting topic though. So... blood clots immediate concern following receiving j&amp;j az vaccination, also concern later on? Say 3 months later, 3 years later, 30 years later? know there’s “track record” compare, evidence reasonable likely concern? Science went window long time ago anyway. throwing shit wall long time. Québec hinted open AZ vaccines people 45 understand think get vaccine second shot. long think it'll IOC officially announces Olympics cancelled? Given Japan's abysmal vaccine program, undoubtedly eventually forced to, opinion. kind address proof? passport course L'm worried taking away tourist visa. I've heard stories people getting visas revoked left country getting vaccine. Yeah, except unemployment. wife, work shutdown, doubled salary. great 2 months. chosen take AZ give population confidence special vaccine.

Sounds like leadership me. Wait, people said healthy reduce risk? can't even begin understand Germany get first dibs vaccine literally developed country! almost like really care since covid hitting hard US last summer. mean venue stupid precautions? based on? State/county ordinances? volition? 67% efficacy absolutely ""very good"". flu vaccine 67%, would one best we've ever had. swear, got spoiled M-RNA vaccines. 67% great vaccine. 95% efficacy (likely lower variants added in) par best vaccines we've ever made. think people realize insane 95% efficacy is. Millionaires ""okay"" billionaires also exist. millionaire still extremely successful. understand headline might bring connotation opening schools *bad* reopened activities instead (that's media you!), believe actually right decision. In-person school important kids' education emotional well-being, *should* prioritized restaurants businesses. Schools often considered ""super-spreaders"", many ways keep safe, like mask rules, social distancing, hybrid schedules, cohorts. Also, enforce masks schools, restaurants. Schools last close first open. Exercise obesity anywhere near mutually exclusive. I've biked like fiend pandemic still gained like 20 lbs. Obesity food tiny bit exercise. truth sure yet. People say otherwise, guessing. much enrollment drop? considered nuts saying needed fight Covid. Short answer: Probably yes 

Long answer: far has, enough research prove protect every variant present Yes. You’re theorizing conspiracy hide real number blood clots found. „do really believe six however million“. Making definition conspiracy theorist Indy! Cover nose! Cover nose! one point, 4 family members vaccinated, two J&amp;J, two Phfizer, one Pfizer series heart attacks two weeks following vaccination. anyone investigating relation vaccine? Absolutely not, oh he’s old, meant happen. reported anywhere? No, it’s dismissed coincidence. Here’s one tidbit, hope mRNA expresses muscle immune reaction occurs, doesn’t due improper injection factors? expresses heart brain? think need consider stronger travel restrictions countries robust vaccination. people look entire last year context?

The pandemic year.

Actions taken first month affect next, on. fuck anti vaxxer. I’m pro vax know vaccinated people can’t spread it. I’m fully vaccinated Covid two Pfizer shots. wear mask order comply mandate. wear nose avoid fogging glasses. Pre vaccine, masking fullest. Wore N95 store every time. South Africa paused US paused. hopefully open soon I've seen lot reports mostly center people partially recently vaccinate, full protection effect. yet see good studies fully vaccinated, hopefully works. wait end summer (like mid end Aug) would that.... even precautionary California drop occupancy measures June 15th, leaving venue decide what's safe. It'll probably take month sites see safely host since hotel resort wants bad PR outbreak occurs. I'm pretty sure mid August close pre-pandemic normalcy, especially outdoor wedding. remember year ago people suggested sunlight, exercise, healthy eating fight covid considered conspiracy nuts things accepted mainstream. really

Okay, anti-vaxxer.  Probably true, guess 2 weeks baseline ‘recommended’ waiting period!  live Brazil, people 70 still receiving 2nd shot, course helps, studied deadlier p1 is, personal experience limited seeing full picture. Meanwhile 47% republican men refuse. much article: J&amp;J reached Covid-19 vaccine rivals ask join study risks blood clots &amp; speak one voice safety .

So sorry happened you. 4th 5th... countries havent dragged feet lock downs, distancing, masks already mostly back normal. US' lackluckster response, politicization public health crisis, disinformation around masks vaccines, US never able achieve level. 

If enough people part wearing masks getting vaccinated, run risk COVID becoming endemic returning seasonally every year might wearing forever least seasonally. Honestly, think would good thing people continue wearing masks peak sickness seasons helps number viruses well. That's standard practice parts world. damage exactly? 95% unvaccinated people “have dodged COVID” use headlines language. metrics currently decreasing, let's hope beginning downward what? you’re vaccinated cares?  Long term effects Covid also unknown, short-term risks well documented however. went wearing N95 mask, cloth mask that, one cheap face shields. Everyone looked like insane.

This place COVID vaccine waiting area chairs next main shopping isles people walking *maskless* store enforcing mask usage. stood least 10 feet everyone. Pretty sure ventilation ok, that's also hard say without knowledge.

People pointed laughed. One dude stared condescending smile. Why? I'm hurting dude. think speed vaccination programs purchasing vaccines. total disaster EU forcing us one lockdown other. vaccines available previous months predicament. eggs? 😄 wondering I’ve got Fibromyalgia. take pain relief suffer it? Madera vacancies weeks. Canada. Toronto close multiple vaccination sites due supply think need spend time shit holes call US one. Every country faults, people clamoring get cesspit. person coughs standing feet away breathe virus considered transmission ""through air."" Airborne transmission would mean virus remains suspended air long infected person left. medical consensus point covid typically spreads.  personally would take cold lol. Maybe unusually bad flu season, want norm. Yes, agree everything said. true, violated initial delivery promises atleast three times last couple weeks! ;) Ignorance bliss say shows 114 269 deaths 0-4 years old. 114 + 269. 

The reason talking numbers said way 200, untrue. 700 car accidents kill children every year still drive. 70 million kids us. virus real.risk kids. know exactly what's going happen vaccine... thing would kid got covid without sickness... Antibodies job...just like adults.... know adults kids made different things right? Like understand wanting kid safe would make even safe. getting covid keep kids safe... Antibodies change kid adult.

TIL 34% increase pleateu  basically works like this. Adults taking higher risk first test phase, first humans get it, clear lot trials that. larger group human adults closing get safe effective dose. lot adults got shot proved safe effective. Children still humans testing kills but, dose good children. risk point overdosed minimal. inching forward find safe dose children. would suggest look background, large weight decision.

He bunch boards development drugs companies, personally helped create many drugs ceo “scientist doctor” phizer. heavily involved still helping make drugs even ceo. “I avoided using science washing hands *and staying away sick people*”

I mean really it’s last part claim that’s important. Again, tell recognize sick people many fellow citizens seem fail identify them? adults least one shot US. 

80.4% 65+ year olds too. Waiting till means every person got JJ 2 weeks shot. makes sense. It'll give idea true number blood clot cases. Hopefully increase all.  AstraZeneca vaccine thinking man. women. Increases number everyone else. again, pausing J&amp;J makes sense add country wide response. 

1/500 people dead N. Dakota Covid. 1/7 contracted it. amount arguing make less obvious vaccination saves lives blood clots kill. Russia believe Sputnik V best world. vaccinate personally care myself.  covid grants 80% immunity"" would fine headline.

Perhaps ""Study marine recruits finds covid grants 80% immunity"" sample bias. Well crap widespread adherence

No wonder poorly America. Taiwan also one nations rely lockdowns (i.e. restrictions household mixing shelter-in-place restrictions) manage COVID, fact alone gotten attention. 6 cases 7 million pretty tiny. Unless end lot cases near future reason stop it. break smart idea get data, wait longer live normal life less one million chance going happy.

You probably better chance getting killed traffic way vaccination. take flu vaccine build scratch every year. based vaccines used developed longer I've alive. widespread long term studies show vaccine developing child. People need stop acting there's risk all, pretty much idea not. Tell what- provide *name source funding*. I'll wait. right someone need sign kids trials like pandemic won’t end. BUT... absolutely don’t blame parents don’t want sacrifice (even small ish risk) kids benefit community. It’s choice completely valid one. I’m thankful parents do, don’t blame parents don’t   Terrible thing leader ain't anything denying I’d rather locked home like fucking prisoner, thank you.

And I'd rather pandemic matter. well, are

They haven’t begun yet, they’re currently process diluting treating it. better get convince people get vaccinated. people vaccinated, less likely future lockdown is. issue federal state governments refuse implement measures actually work part genuine lockdown. They're regulating prives lives like there's tomorrow companies asked allow people work home instead obligating wherever possible. schools still open.

It's worst worlds. issue night curfews implemented tough lockdown. Portugal saw great success. Meanwhile, we've semi-lockdown forever. worked B117 arrived infections hospitalizations rising measures finally slowly starting implement (and many states districts still bitching) likelihood stabilize numbers coming... months? There's end sight probably late summer vaccines properly effect. then, ICUs continue crowded everyone's afraid genuine, tough 2-3 week lockdown would allow us open back moderately vaccine effect kicks in.

And thousands people literally die nothing. even helping economy. Even economic experts called tougher measures. industry associations afraid they've well ever since end first (and far only) actual lockdown Germany. water wet feel good thing paused check shows proper ways handle it’s Emergency Use vs approved.
It instill confidence system works should.
But wouldn’t make people panic doom so. timeline likely either exposed prior vaccine, antibodies created. Omg love cheeseburgers!!! 🍔 study would missed asymptomatic infections there's still wiggle room saying vaccinated people still follow guidelines. data show vaccination cuts transmission dramatically.  
 
I've working US 4 months I'm due return Canada weekend. I'm fully vaccinated still quarantine 14 days. agree .. offering carrots get vaccinated (apart obvious one saving life) infection fatality rate 0.25% 90% occurring age 65+ health conditions, far lower, like orders magnitude lower young health people. one puts IFR healthy 25 year old 0.001%. difference risk highest risk (80+ health conditions) lowest (&lt;= 11 healthy) literally 50,000x.

Then keep mind chances getting covid low... Pfizer trials, 170 cases 36,000 people 0.4%. months still.

There potential risks besides dying also rare.

My point risk skewed. say young healthy people take vaccine, should. setting policy, two vaccines available proven even safe, running surplus, would really insist everyone take slightly risky vaccine? answer may well yes... point slam dunk. masking forever? Hey, sounds familiar. climate change. fine. Got second Moderna Tuesday. First shot arm sore. Second shot sore arm 12 hours bad joint soreness pain. arthritis though predisposed joint pain. I'm confused, thought vaccine stop catching disease guaranteed get hospitalized die?

Does mean vaccines actually confer full immunity mean vaxxed people tend wear masks distance behave responsibly worried we’d see pandemic dragged long. New variants?! Thank god don’t live germany someone said EU members really fucked up, true. exercise means less risk developing severe Covid, according compelling new study physical activity coronavirus hospitalizations. study, involved almost 50,000 Californians developed Covid, found active falling ill least likely hospitalized die result illness.

The data gathered Covid vaccines became available suggest exercise substitute way immunization. intimate regular exercise — whether it’s going swim, walk, run bike ride — substantially lower chances becoming seriously ill become infected.



Scientists known time aerobically fit people less likely catch colds viral infections recover quickly people shape, part exercise amplify immune responses. Better fitness also heightens antibody responses vaccines influenza illnesses.
But infections novel coronavirus new little known whether, how, physical activity fitness might affect risks becoming ill Covid. recent studies, however, seemed encouraging. one, published February International Journal Obesity, people could walk quickly, accepted gauge aerobic fitness, developed severe Covid much lower rates sluggish walkers, even quick striders obesity, known risk factor severe disease. another study older adults Europe, greater grip strength, indicator general muscle health, signaled lowered risks Covid hospitalizations.

But studies looked indirect measures people’s aerobic muscular fitness actual, everyday exercise habits, cannot tell us getting moving — staying still — changes calculus Covid risks.

[...] Got first shot Pfizer!! ....I can’t lift arm!! like science too, science hasn’t told us exact point data finally stop wear masks around us vaccinated Yeah, like peek alternate universe Trump second term. Feels like dodged bullet. say ""EU members fucked up"" implies comparison someone fucked up. point vaccine reduce spread reduce severity illness unfortunately still catch it. COVID stopped. could system forces every single person vaccinated (which realistically going happen) still animal reservoirs spread humans. virus also continue mutate, vaccines need updates, meantime outbreaks. manage flu (which endemic reasons) manage COVID going forward. course fudging around edges (and looking medians rather confidence interval overlaps) well studies constructed, part results roughly comparable. need give points back JnJ adjust South African variant, otherwise studies ""close enough"". 

I know folks bent shape recognizing - least short term efficacy - mRNA vaccines appear better. reflected reported efficacy studies well antibody titer data theoretically linked protectiveness. 

JnJ one dose always going batting behind AstraZeneca made decision use stabilized spike protein based early titer data showed might necessary (not bad decision time, help ensure variety approaches/spike protein case stabilized version issues reason). Even irrespective whether mRNA efficient delivery mechanism (it probably is), two facts alone would/will potentially lead *apparent* efficacy difference two vaccine families. Check bringing US thread Germany comment EU? Hi - PM help you. live northern CA able book appointments quite easily. No. fact I’d assume opposite. Pfizer’s primary objective remain top virus order contain changes may occur. Theyre paid lots money so. simply standard procedure. booster would ideally prevent future breakout/variant scenario. announcement blown proportion discussed throughout entire pandemic we’d likely need plan sort annual booster/vaccine capacity. heart goes &amp; words, wish could help. devastating you. get &amp; let give up. Make promise keep moving matter much need cry vent whatever gets through, get through. something get ""over"" through. far risking health &amp; viewing, please protect yourselves. Extra hand sanitizer...put sign frame brief ""no hugs"" (politely not, whatever works) want to. People mean well hopefully respect wishes. Maybe small things combined help. Prayers &amp; Dad &amp; pups. feelings valid, well~ vaccinated don’t need social distance takes 2 weeks go full effect. 

Potentially also exposed even getting shot (since timeline week). bleqk future, always live fear sudden lockdown. cannot plan anything anymore. Next new years party planned months aheqd, hotels booked? Sucks clubs qnd bars close new years sit home. First, percentage known people gotten second shot still gotten Covid? many people thousand talking? hundreds thousands. 65+ population around near 80% vaccinated they’re risk. Like said, it’s available anyone month now, point ends? I'm certain pessimistic. I, example, never get flu shot I'm eagerly waiting Covid vaccine. think many young people think way. want save many lives possible? Stop driving cars. Mandate healthy eating exercise. Completely ban smoking. stop? like odds! Bye masks! 12 years studied 12 years later drop completely 12 years? vaccinated around 1% people think.  Comparing US Brazilian healthcare insane.

that's reddit ya I’m Correct, there’s spike FL even infected individual(s) travel, go state high vaccination issues aren’t likely see problems Nice study, but
COVID choice,
and alternatives AZ got first moderna shot 2 days ago felt sore arm. nervous really nothing worry  not. Lockdown way prevent healthcare collapsing, vaccines enough. Physical distancing mask wearing must continue indefinitely too. No, really isn't. Fuck. Everything people increases societal spread, includes work, shopping food, going school, hanging buddy. problem is, certain things much harder shut others without MASSIVE impacts society (like, can't get food, would problem). governments first target things without massive impact, like socializing free time. Yes sucks, impact less starving death. Last summer guidance aerosol simulators said shared space poor ventilation dozens others hours even masked high risk. We’ve apparently decided it’s safe schools. somehow brief play date indoors actually play (I.e. get within 6 feet of) another kid fully vaccinated parents masked higher risk that? don’t think so. Yep. guaranteed taking one risk and.... Oh. Also guaranteed risk think control different sanitize going mall. Thanks, kind get it, point is, nobody knows true probability getting severely ill given longer time frame/many different instances exposure. guess time tell. doesn’t feel like one aggressive pandemics sweeps globe, kills bunch people leaves everyone alone. feels like something might chip people slowly many generations come. Plus many unknowns (will regular exposure Covid constant vaccinating modify people’s immune systems? asymptomatic Covid still produce undesirable effects? Nobody knows. doesn’t look like completely eradicated world hasn’t lived virus before). point got this, first shot bad terms side effects. second one might feel feverish lethargic (I recommended take day following second dose work case). way better potential death factor actual virus. Another gift Slavery. Sounds like Philippines. ....isn’t though, knowing vaccines exist Andrew wildly distributed? assume theyre vaccinated now? kind thinking move us forward understand good is, don’t need know rate infection unvaccinated population timeframe (presumably months)? 

By way, wouldn’t surprised number relatively high compared figure—just would like see complete argument. florida still open? might feel like mild flu second shot. big deal. fine. because, similarly flu vaccine, vaccinated mean can't get get COVID mean can't spread it. less likely get it, importantly get it, significantly less likely experience severe symptoms. Also, antibodies vaccine last forever (I think saw ~6 months somewhere). went local Kaufland 6:00 pm day. pretty crowded, lines checkouts ridiculously long two open (and even self checkout ones). *really* loved though fact two lines right next other. chose option led highest possible density people, especially nowadays people even give shit physical distancing anymore (which probably big issue aerosols etc still). baffling. I'm also Dutch: colleagues patients who've already vaccinated got slice pie cake waited 15 minutes. sure liked that. Uff. Hopefully doesn’t last long! vomit last night though usual felt bit better reported 6 previously reported? Lmao knew low didn’t know literally zero Hello, fellow Washingtonian! gotten jab yet? Canada, ninjas bikes fast nicknamed coffins wheel.  tested positive week took J&amp;J vaccine. wasn’t fully vaccinated I’m pretty sure I’m rare case wonder high ups rather needed order make money. Covid ending cash cow big pharma. No, read actually said abundance caution. Basically ""we need prepare third shot"", nothing decided yet. Yes, deaths spike city state may local restrictions well may convince people area get vaccinated need massive restrictions across country. So, you’re suggesting mask mandates stay forever, correct? things true many viruses sweep across country every year. 345,287 * .0058 = 2,002
