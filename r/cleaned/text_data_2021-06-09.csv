Perhaps evolutionary escape alter spike way ultimately less dangerous. there's export here, question: vaccine said prevent getting infected, prevents getting really sick. Yet, understand correctly, means still carry virus, vaccinated people still wear mask observe distancing, least that's Belgium.

However, also keep saying ought vaccinate much possible acquire herd immunity... acquire herd immunity vaccinated people still carry transmit disease?

For record, I'm planning get jab soon turn encouraged parents same, still, see fits herd immunity idea.  hope Ireland included since never shuts us. oh lawd Breaking news “No Shit” desk!  lot isnt getting couch eating less. many places country expensice eat healthy. way better study lab catch us surprise. think got vaccines quickly?

Sorry, leadership, ""America First"" finest. course donations great welcomed, leadership. Leadership EU, Russia China doing, even sold vaccines, flow around world, hoarding first, distribute ""peasants"" around world. seen UK vaccinated US? That's Trump yes. lot damage relationships reputation. immune person come contact variant different test positive would person another strong immune response? Exactly this, on. Plus allergies greatly reduced! think people UK's sentiment ""let's get everyone possibly vaccinated, go lives"". personally agree this. seen single member family since pandemic started, next week I'll finally able see mum again, fully vaccinated, I've first dose. She'll isolate 6 days 2 negative PCR tests interact, worth it. 
The people sensible whole time consistently let give toss. soul destroying every time there's spike, wondering ""how much longer I'll able see family?"". increase cases everything began open back expected. really matters  many people become unwell, end needing medical care.  im 30 got first jab week ago UK 

My dad 61 got second jab close month ago

Thats at, top 20s first dose think 50+ second doses. Side note, good uptake rate.

The question facing case load matters much anymore (or least matter weeks delta spreads)

By large everyone likely get seriously ill protected, coming line every day Canada taking chances vaccines issues Trump diverting shipments PPE Canada paid for. Hopefully, he'll apologise...  son close contact work hours (unavoidable instance) went home got sick next day. Positive test. wore masks, normal everyday ones, son test positive. Masks help. think people medical field would know enough understand value vaccinations. reasons avoid cruises? Always curious since I've never one also got jab way. ""Go fucking doctor"" still stupid thing say. Call loan? Maybe Bidens way squaring things Canada Trump diverted PPE Canada bought told 3m stop selling PPE Canada too. Deaths undercounted even advanced countries lower populations better health infra. There's way india would better chance Sounds distopoan lot top nations need this.  agreed you.

We (Aus) dont access enough doses vaccine. cost, surely afford it. supply. US buys means less left pathetic vaccine roll out. Georgian, people need go vaxx asap saying Canada manipulating data also extremely slow? say fact days Germany catch US' first vaccinations? happen lead US has, right? arguing here. Germany ahead USA soon reach high levels vaccinations US might even achieve suitable percentage. Funny Germany vaccinating faster UK ever much slower US peak, despite Germany even reached peak. Try Efficacy pointless number, judge vaccine effectiveness. Hausarzt years live side country yet got vaccinated 2 weeks ago. know yet, also specialised doctors vaccinate (I got vaccinated HNO-Arzt). Easiest way using doctolib, could gotten several appointments  ridiculous? Unvaccinated workers likely transmit deadly disease. It’s brainer request someone else instead paranoid pseudohealth weirdo. Brazilian I'm jealous US going back normal  thinking sad day everyone failed medical school. would allow elaborate:

I think US done many good many bad things. mention bad things prove point, US necessarily better allies feel failed you, meant criticizing US issue.

What meant earlier sentiment, well Americans sharing sentiment, damage foreigners view country cements view Americans ""only caring themselves"". Still understand views represent Americans whole, criticizing sentiment entire population Right wrong, I’ve drawn opinion want give away American taxpayer money appears altruistic world stage.

Well, yes, think richer countries help poorer countries. necessarily appear altruistic, would actually make difference help humanity.

And care altruism still selfish, strategical reasons this. Vaccine diplomacy cost-effective form power projection since places hold means production time essence. chances like project much soft power little money.

The motives matter much me, matters still don’t think highly America rush point it’s flaws. 

As said, pointed USA's flaws prove point attacking countries. point ""maybe help eachother even governments bad things"" rather thinking neither help US countries listed. scenario likely happen. dramatic happening newer variants slightly decrease vacinne's effectiveness protecting asymptomatic symptomatic disease. also reason example UK speeding second doses single dose protective new variants. 


There reason need new flu vaccine every year. Living covid19 likely like that. New booster vaccines already developed tested speed there, ensure high uptake groups offered Trump would neeeever done this, himself. would sold someone else, surplus. helping vaccine co keep 1st world prices Read rule number 2. run bit efficiently. Apotheke ones pretty much similar described.

luckily, tests longer needed live since cases relativley low (at least now). im sick government mishandling entire thing Although whats funny flatmates Malaysia (we're international students living UK) families back Malaysia mostly gotten vaccine however us still waiting first dose. guess Malaysia know versus age.  Darling, said “cue the…” trigger team red, I’m expecting say it, haven’t said it, I’m offering narrow minded opinion.

I’m leftist, even Democrat. Yeah, understand righties, they’re full 99.5% time. Bunch cute reactionaries. 

But you’re looking better example here, that’s even related story, give idea I’m coming from, like team red screamed moaned “possibly” covid carrying migrants coming spreading covid. Now, I’m sure smart thinking members team red didn’t actually believe this, lowest common denominators sure did, repeating flaccid talking points, expressing covid concerns whole rejecting covid precautions.

But okay, boo. Funny - reaction comment pretty much complete opposite yours. guess highly depends runs test station. variant developed India..  working quite well. 

There huge amount free private test stations government pays good money every completed test. 

I test station street - pretty much wait time. walk 5 minutes get test done within less 5 minutes. result sent email 15 minutes later use result go places 24 hours. July 24th, cruises ships USA resume service

 test half assed thing ever seen. especially since needed specific things.

there centers open, lots run antiquated pan paper system. basically leads standing long line test. standing waiting get test results (which say takes 15 minutes, actually close half hour). youre basically spending hour this. nothing rapid it.

besides, big shitstorm handling tests, highly inaccurate, performed usually unskilled personnel whos training short video tutorial. fuck? live near here. fuck med field still 5x undercounted unaccounted dead bodies floating Ganges America: Socialised Healthcare lead us Communism
Also America: *This* ""Go fucking doctor"" stupid response many people. everyone living fucking place live. 

If change place time, work whatever (welcome 21th century), fucking Hausarzt. guess what, try getting one right now! answers fucking delusional. Damn, that's even frustrating. Hopefully things speed EU now. I'm Germany slow start really picking momentum. Hopefully bigger countries like UK, Germany, France speeding it'll free manafacturing rest EU outside too. US done vaccinating domestically it'll huge boost manafacturing, really pump large numbers vaccine hope speeds things up. Keep safe hope vaccines make soon, neighbour one republican said this. Leftists understand rightists. 

Most see saying funny Biden spending estimated $10,000,000,000 vaccines world one cent student loan forgiveness. Completely unecessarily tho. ""non"" mandatory vaccination would simply postpone week so. since really need one get reasonable summer, go immediately.

Okay? Sure. Annoyed? Sure well. 

I OK before, would OK now, even without vaccine. Never even got living plague supposed catch die immediately. mean fire em? ain't fucking anti vaxxers.  hope parents get cancer. said, hospitalizations among unvaccinated become high enough people protected two doses, still cause problems even they're mainly young people likely survive.

This happening Chile. One countries highest proportion people vaccinated, peak levels COVID hospitalizations. biggest age group 40 years old, one dose (Also used vaccine Chile Sinovac's, much one dose) Biden administration spend tax payer money line pocket massive pharmaceutical company. I'm vaccinating Coronavirus, enforce policy without violating HIPAA? Set infrastructure sending US. It’s easier shift populated parts Canada basically border US. like old joke, call doctor barely passed courses.. doctor.    think understandable he'd prefer Cal/OSHA revise rules instead via executive order. thankfully they're doing:  getting 64% Americans agree anything hard fuck agree.

They released Bay Area native, Seattle short list place I'd consider ever moving here. scared lol. started easing restrictions couple months ago [a bit 4th paused re-opening. plan remove restrictions June 30 (or sooner hillbillies would get shots) Yeah people can't wait travel get vaccinated. They'll generate revenue world's better situation overall. Let known, around 0.7% yearly defense budget. Point fucking 7 percent. would rather 500 *million* dollars, save tens thousands lives help potentially eradicate global pandemic, make national defenses 0.7% better?

Honestly buy Lockheed Martin f-35 jets you’ve well surpassed 500 million. jets. many human lives single fighter plane worth? whole f-35 program cost country 1.7 TRILLION dollars said done. Vaccination centers receiving 2.4 mln doses per week since couple weeks now. numbers stable centers seen indeed phased yet. fact, deliveries increased week 26. check numbers site Bundesgesundheitsministerium warning)

Oh well, week two make much difference guess. Flair USA 

Region ""Mediterranean""  blocked new June 3 rules (unvaccinated folks wear mask everyone vaccinated) went back November rules (everyone must wear mask social distance). 

They allowed change rules twice don’t want June 3rd proposal count one 2. 

The next proposal drafted tomorrow. vote June 17th go effect June 28th. interesting Gov Newsom willing wait long opening everything else June 15th. might executive order change match CDPH (California department public health). exactly ridiculous patients demand health care providers vaxxed? personally guarantee unvaxxed co-workers Covid? Well free mean access equal across class. may able afford day get vaccinated others may not. could also case location close enough able take time schedule drive distance get vaccinated. sure case might Philadelphia reasons think could class discrepancy vaccination rates, among possible mechanisms.  18 tons PPE less one semi truck full. international equivalent throwing roll paper towels. American serious PR world’s dickheads last 5 years.... New normal maskless. Trump signed contracts massively complicating giving away vaccines massively slowing ability send countries. 

So no. Let's silly. Where'd get money!? Lucky pfizer- need sell two shots full dose. Double profits! 

The vax covid, population control (hopefully). state-gaurunteed profits hands taxpayer future inflation extra doses hoarding them. plenty countries would bought vaccines US mandated front line. US going export tens millions AstraZeneca they've stockpiled even approved? expired already, is. dad always said John Elway cheater, anything Denver BS. Sorry lay heavy facts friend surprise, shielding immune systems pathogens year isn’t good thing?? /s

I love rhetoric always anyone skeptical restrictions selfish, perhaps ones begged restrictions fear selfish too? go.
There herd imunity. ""and experts believe big reason may many people dangerous symptoms made lethal mistake staying away hospital fear catching coronavirus.""

The increase COVID. US case numbers coming weeks, deaths per capita still higher countries cases per captia. Either US counting enough, treating right, covid kills Americans  actually read article discussing post? Yong thought standard many rally whole pandemic. critiques valid wonder possible behavioral economics implications CDC mask guidance end. possible study depth, years later, find best course action given algorithms amplification fractionated us incohesive groups? American amalgam makes particularly hard homogenize behavior unless we’re talking something simple visceral like act war. It’s say, mix politics science, get politics it’s unfortunate come this. least appreciate fact CDC forthright statement vaccination mask safety science. vaccine free, time potentially missed lower middle/working class isn't. people live paycheck paycheck, fear side effects vaccine may cause miss work, vital money lose. 

I almost guarantee vaccine uptake upper-middle class/upper class families Philadelphia far higher compared working class city. Looks like Ohio state wins currently philly paid pandemic sick leave employees businesses 50 people. means work small business, likely gonna miss work get vaccinated since choose getting vaccinated possibly bedridden side effects. make mistake, culture divide, still class divide everything crossed vaccines work way country soon...I guess governments order enough issue (although reasons behind often fault, given sheer cost involved), COVAX hopefully pfizer doses US make way left behind vaccine race far. benefits richer countries vaccinated first keep momentum help others without much buying power, pandemic vaccinated, regardless live. Regardless, it’s dangerous flu kids. lots people don’t get flu shot, pretty common people get actually nobody bats eye. Pfizer first ink deal. bet (and market) announce additional purchases moderna jj coming days / weeks. 80+% hospitalizations COVID among obese overweight people. really surprised?

Heart disease kills 600,000+ annually US regular basis. country unhealthy shit. People worried health regarding COVID yet get couch eat less. 42% Americans obese 70% overweight. Well I’m also fully vaccinated it’s big enough deal eyes refuse care it, that’s little extreme. Honestly though, I’d rather people careful careless, won’t judge you. Nice Germany! pretty strong reaction first az dose too. knocked bed 2 days. second moderna dose, hardly felt thing except incredible pain arm 4 days so. day felt marginally rough, without issue. Holy fuck, point I’m morbidly curious bonkers stupid fucking shit people gonna come next Chicken pox? Why? 

Why ask red tape slow action save lives? 

Do even know conditions formal approval? there's mandatory time period must met trials, say, 2 years? fun bomb already dead people. Yeah paper serious case gloom-and-dooms. even raise specter antibody-dependent enhancement -- kicks -- nothing substantive say it. headline predictable. sub-heading stupid, implying think implying. depressing. wonder ""I'm fence"" people find ally take jab plunge reach 70% start vaxxing 3rd world countries. know idiots still think unsafe, despite 80% office getting see every goddamn day. vaccine really mix viral vector vaccines, due limitation (immunity vector)
 
so like sputnik (Ad5 + Ad26) vaccines free. Access could easier. class divide, culture. employees doing. Nah, vaccination centers phased - stabilized 2m doses week increase, role shift mainly giving remaining second doses.

The majority doses right goes doctors, centers I'd never lose sneaky forks spoons magically disappear use time. They'd stick try clean table /s Mexico actually afford vaccines though, make drug cartels pay them, definitely money. Probably best evidence potevkin getting ass handed rematch whyte.. recovered covid clearly person absolutely correct important put info there, lot ""DOUBLE MUTANTS EAT CHILDREN"" type headlines media helping. Viral load transmission peak symptom onset, long severe illness death, thus real selection pressure virus become less deadly. annoying, restrictions handled state level people move around lot. state mostly reopen June 30th, sooner state wide 70% vaccination rate achieved. Scary comment Canada pretty well point - think places much greater need.  Allowing vaccinated tourists going fine...i'm sure many people assume going disaster Looks like drop rates stopped well, 1m day quite reduction peak still 1 million jabs day. clarify--Biden's goal 70% ADULTS, SF 70% PEOPLE, even impressive SF's part. stringent used least.

Smh Seattle always beating Portland everything really sensitive insensitive. feel compelled upvote somebody they're unnecessarily rude. US exactly best international track record either. wars, government funded coups mass surveillance allies come mind ...

Still, purely strategical point view US needs allies stay relevant global scene. country strong enough own. I’m okay that. people need find different profession. Make vaccine Bombs! Yeah, live Ontario prioritizing second doses. Roughly 1% adults getting second dose every day early days obviously going factor however vast majority hospitalised older people who'd never vaccinated plus symptoms severe hospitalised last year. Yep, purely pragmatic perspective, vaccinating Western Hemisphere ASAP best interests. Soft power finest. Perfect. I…nope. depressed. Every vaccine producing country exporting vaccines since last year.

I don’t know sit straight face call global leadership…. “Cause we’re Delta Covid life fucking nightmare!” amazing human money spent elsewhere.

We gigantic problems we're facing. colleague Northwestern University saying even 100% students, faculty staff campus vaccinated, masks distancing going still required Fall 2021 semester. would expected universities astute following health guidelines, worst them. People really sensitive that’s case. Haha wish kind power! don’t live close border now, upon time did- would go US side almost weekly since closest Walmart, get cheaper gas, sometimes splurge American Chinese takeout (many items haven’t seen Canadian Chinese food menu since, would kill crab Rangoon)- just, part routine. can’t imagine types communities fared since then, they’re integrated. think families kept apart year... it’s time, needs happen. don’t pay them. Good luck that.

I also don’t want pay taxes overinflated military budget. realized 5YO can’t always get want shut don’t cry public. rather spend billions protecting world billions bombing it.

Great news! choose. Vaccinate world get back feeding military industrial complex like God intended!! /s It’s difficult calculation. ""Those body odor dine mask receive 20% discount"" guess could've gone Moderna instead, case would've seen ""why Pfizer?"" instead. two vaccines similar enough really matter choose. Perhaps Pfizer/BioNTech available manufacturing capacity, could negotiate better price.

Why J&amp;J? guess would bit cheaper, hand single dose Pfizer/BioNTech shows similar levels protection J&amp;J (if issue people show 2nd dose). also advantage larger manufacturing capacity, higher efficacy (with doses) blood clots (even rare J&amp;J). really ""surge"" cases still 12x lower peaked January? ‘Cause keys made ferrous metals attracted magnets.

Big surprise  fair, Seattle’s still masked King County’s Public Health chief advising stay way reach 70% vaxxed case rates still bit high (though finally really declining way everyone else’s did). He’s said we’ll fine drop mask requirement state opens fully end month. think we’ll see people let go masks point, outdoor masking rates visibly dropping already.

A lot people need extra time adjust new normal. I’m personally paranoid hell due immune issues, watching case counts drop vax rates go reassuring enough I’ll happy ditch mask soon…just time put back wildfire season.

LMAO tf even you?

Make sure get vaccinated, buddy. That’s conversation about. Try focus.


You’re trying create sort BS morality test order deflect actual point conversation started. Again, everyone selfish like you. people happy pay taxes reasons this. get it, aren’t. Move on. TRIP waiver much long global lack raw materials. cannot make vaccines without all. mention mRNA vaccines much complex traditional, inactivated vaccines, frankly many places means produce enough 3% world's population

Yes, like whole world relying donations. Places like USA, EU, UK, India, Russia China means produce vaccines, together make roughly half world's population. Many countries also afford import vaccines. 

It like *only* source vaccines course enough vaccinate whole world, enough make major impact. they’re infants you’re missing key B cell repertoire development phase. top vaccine exports come substitute them? point 18 immunocompromised sorry ass gets COVID you. excuse now. essentially vaccine corner CVS's Walgreens. going SOL hospital bill comes suffer life long complications die. wait ""Omega variant.""

Won’t children exposed within year? aren’t talking years non-exposure. seems like necessary risk pandemic. Canada pledged give away excess doses well. 

Trudeau ordered 300 million doses various manufacturers start help fund ensure delivery. would ensure would receive vaccine matter one came effective.

Kenya didn’t share intel us help us catch 1996.

Vaccinated people masks offering miniscule amount protection vulnerable community, unmasked vaccine refuses exposing significant risk. pretty disheartening reality situation many parts country. Vaccinated people masks mean hardly anything long unmasked vaccine refusers moving freely around community, circulating public spaces. Unless officials force masks vaccines, change. even happen last summer, way happen summer. communism.

Oxymoron century. That, perhaps, good legitimate reasons anti-US. Denver post said last Friday 98% capacity. also said majority covid hospitalizations un-vaccinated people.

Sometimes hospitalIzation numbers tricky section covid full keeping beds open trauma say full. Nothing wrong that, another way give data. probably seeing percentage 12+ least 1 dose. Texas DSHS says too.

But percentage 12+ 2 44.8. Sadly, every day vax numbers given go drastic margin.

Again, 12+, full pop.

They careful skew stats look bad. number fully vax people. 10,788,383.

2019 stat pop 29 million.

The math says 37.2% fully vaxxed Texas now.

And even glass half full person, number partially vaxxed+fully 13 million. 44.83 %. Indoor mask mandates, distancing required restaurants tables. Unvaccinated households still shouldn’t socialize unvaccinated households. Probably percentage capacity indoor events I’m sure They'll reevaluate going forward. Fuck empirical shit. trust stories strangers internet Vermont got 2nd yesterday. Makes total sense. get almost 190M doses still initial order, suppose majority donated.  Here's problem though: evidence presented article 3 employees WIV went hospital November 2019 covid-like symptoms. coughing raised temperature. Hardly smoking gun, exact symptoms flu.

Also, pandemic end till world vaxxed makes sense.  challenge author article find 10,000 people WANT vaccine cannot get “access.” ample resources every part country get vaccine.

China thinks saying population 1.4 billion people outlier statistics - extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.

Then world judge risks trading China worth occasional pandemic - happen situation unreformed.

.... shocked would lie mentioned boss taking projects preparing let go end contract August. 

We need liars join company.  I'd rather magnetic dead tbh. makes even dumber usual shit push. based current trajectory (I don’t think hold) we’d 10k 7 day average less 30 days. went 70k current 40k 26 days. Within next 2-3 weeks 20k, lowest point since days pandemic.

Yeah, tailed bit last week I'm pleasantly surprised. Especially continued vax rate, even though slowed significantly surprised many new people eligible months still getting it. reach 20k goal within 3 weeks think.  Wild exaggeration. Undercounting deaths Brazil worse US many Western European countries. far worse offenders there.

Actually, look studies aiming estimate true number deaths virus, Brazil slips second worst world fourth. Mexico, much smaller population, deaths, Russia, also much smaller (and somewhat richer) population 1% fewer deaths. per capita basis, US bad Brazil (as May)

People make mistake assuming worst countries ones hear media reports dreadful conditions, reality countries better reporting. countries worst virus ones never hear about. look Egypt Kazakhstan; apparently 15x deaths they're reporting.  Yes! Exactly! Could bunch different things. Small counties like likely reporting delays spikes counts. believe Texas reporting spike backlogged cases recently.

If new facility opened changes antibody tests counted taken place, sorts extra data blips happen. Well, that's didn't. Pfizer vaccine actually developed BioNTech, German company. (Who BTW reserve vaccines first, neither countries significant vaccine manufacturing). 

And secondly, aware Pfizer, Moderna, Emergent Biosolutions, etc. owned US government. multinational private companies work they're happy sell anyone. France apparently that's months back Mesa county's health department tried jump ahead rest state offering vaccine general population state government intervened Detroit, it’s coming you. Please vaccinate! 35% vax rate true. disagree statement! neighbor wife got second dose. Back February adamant getting it. started asking us last months vaccines. would say, “Good. don’t worry covid now.” Today said, “why aren’t people getting it? stupid them!” I’m glad changed mind.  31% will. Unfortunately, majority not. According Bloomberg yesterday we've hit 2.2 Billion worldwide doses!

[recommendations Decades religious indoctrination help either. Religion great job suppressing critical thinking skills. ....seriously? USA got Pfzier?  ???  probably did, probably worked.

Then sat AC while, sweat dried, stopped working. think part trap, though, arguing ""real"" cause death is: COVID vs. comorbidities. Deniers point comorbidities correctly show cause, thinking somehow means deaths caused COVID. think correct response say, ""Yeah, what? mean COVID *also* cause therefore *also* killing people.""

I mean, really choose whether smoking lung cancer *really* kills people? clearly do. Student loans work too. 99% classmates didn’t rich parents pay Urns indirect evidence. Wuhan 12 million inhabitants. average year 80 thousand people die. delivery thousand urns ordinary.

There data excess deaths report ""5954 additional (4573 pneumonia) deaths occurred 2020 compared 2019, excess risks greater central suburban districts (50% v 15%). parts Hubei province (n=19 DSP areas), observed mortality rates pneumonia chronic respiratory diseases non-significantly 28% 23% lower predicted rates, despite excess deaths covid-19 related pneumonia""

So 2-4x reported number high side according excess deaths take account fewer traffic accidents less air pollution normal due lockdown hides true numbers little.

Russia draconian lockdown allowed spread country, hence much higher numbers compared China.

And sometime comes says we’ll never get rid completely, many people know Polio?

Edit:
Also flu deaths came without masking. covid deaths spite precautions. going unmitigated spread would worse. Yeah I'm confused hell. Location Mediterranean, company Switzerland. Ship make U.S. port... 

The thing U.S. article Washington post... rule? I’m Canadian moved Arizona last month. got shot #2 (Pfizer) here, getting shot #1 late January BC. concerned length time shots people spoke setting second dose weren’t worried thought longer stretch shots may actually helped build antibodies something - can’t recall specifics. lose license. recommended older people; older people vaccinated, order speed campaign cities implemented ‘walk in’ vaccinations all, get AZ shots would otherwise go wasted. believe still vast majority young people getting Pfizer Moderna. went date many years ago woman written profile.

FDA saying give EUA antibody data better AZ's antibody data, even without Phase III trial. guess need vaccine expert tell us whether theory really makes sense not.

Not vaccine expert, understanding prior this, Taiwan domestic cases. Hence domestic participants trials.

So next best approximation data domestically infected population AZ. Hence comparison AZ antibody data. 

Real experts, please feel free correct. know aware symptoms? sounds like get hospitalized maybe early enough? Sorry, seems completely plausible given data available far. sad.

You paid actor try influence us. couple weeks ago man came hospital claiming magnetic vaccinated. turns indeed magnetized. doctors stuck spoons bottle opener chest.

Obviously entire hospital like wtf... 

Well turns recently gone surgery metallic implant placed somewhere back. Somebody made oopsie regarding quality control implant!!! People risk severe illness vaccinated small percentage population. I'm worried variant regards vaccines. worried havoc cause areas low vaccine uptake. think understood article correctly. article says vaccine studies.

I stated Taiwanese News follow quoting from? article link.

As statement preceding quote, FDA. know news watching, statement quite absurd.

I agree. 

So want provide detail actual immunobridging? 6/10, 41.4% Ohioans completed vaccine 46.4% started it. Vaccines easily available awhile here. explained main comment.

""Here AZ J&amp;J vaccines recommended people 60 initiatives (""open days"") give everyone benefit skipping line.""

Basically yes, supposed like ""recommendation"", whatever means, regions Italy felt like could give anyway. lose job stunt. wouldnt want hospital using immunobridging form studies own, whereas \[at least according FDA US\] US immunobridging usually done vaccine different age groups:

I think understood article correctly. article says vaccine approach, immune response biomarker(s) elicited vaccine pediatric age group compared immune response biomarker(s) elicited vaccine relevant adult age group, formal statistical hypothesis testing demonstrate measured immune response pediatric age group non-inferior adults.

Where quoting from? article suppose using J&amp;J \[this example\], statistically approximate vaccine response one group using vaccine another smaller sample number. 
 
For Taiwan, understanding watching Taiwanese news, like using K&amp;K, distinctively different vaccine using similar methodology J&amp;J, would use J&amp;J's study approximate K&amp;K's efficacy.

I know news watching, statement quite absurd. 

More info [Medigen thought supposed used older people? try delay tho Texas 30 million people. never agree saving measly amount human lives better causing great harms 30 million people Someone lose game plague inc way people think *difficult* (although impossible, sure) making decision wait.

There's also group, I've pointed several times, already infected. change calculus, many people makes holding much appealing (and much less risky). know group massive. Shhhhhhh. knows much already! haven’t learned anything public policy, covid one way street since May 2020.

Welcome 2022 Magnetolympics!   Let's hope so. much say. came JW drop propaganda door.

Basically science lesson consisted teacher saying ""here tell you"" shaking head. 

Then would say ""but Bible says"" obviously leading students biblical answers nature. she’s saying she’s anti vax due magnets also got vax she’s magnetic? Source 200,000+ claim? I'd like dig deeper OK you. Shit. better lay cocaine. Unfortunately survival rate still high that. Part kinda hopes virus gets deadly vaccine efficacy obviously stays same. Welcome Costco. love you. Canadian province zero covid cases long time last year. several clusters traced back travel. Unless there's community spread happening kept things open. LA huge, almost like saying ""Montana, Wyoming Dakotas..."". Definite agree, regional differences really intriguing. Perhaps, even shut still peddles nonsense. Last heard caused outbreak measles Somali population living Minneapolis around 2017. directly measuring ability blood sterilize virus. repeatedly dilute blood longer so. 5-fold means dilute 5x less. 

5x antibodies actually lot enough, measuring sterilizing immunity blood immune response. sterilizing immunity important, 5x antibodies needed antibody half-life 1000 days (per study) means sterilizing immunity might last 7 years less lineages. Quest spike protein antibody test.  spent one month Vermont 2018, knock state (it’s nice place) it’s probably least attractive group people I’ve seen life. want date, hope personality guy that's top kent variant, already way infectious strain ravaging America 2020 completely irrelevant. job media big tech determine discussion value.

that's dystopian nightmare allow go unchecked Overwhelming hospitals Yeah wish would true actually lot mRNA doses Italy, girl would vaccinated soon Pfizer Moderna anyway go ""open day"".

We basically even notice difference drop AZ J&amp;J now, sad regions Italy whatever reasons felt like giving vaccine even reccomendation FDA (AIFA). really want go another cruise, definitely stick line mandates vaccination. don’t think “it easy get vaccine” “people making excuses” mutually exclusive. proposals might get people’s ass gear make get shot. 

I want everyone vaccinated quickly possible. think hypothetical people talking (other students…which “access” issue timing issue) exist low numbers. millions millions people can’t get work 3 jobs take care kids. majority people aren’t getting vaccine point don’t want it. incredibly lazy. think many cruise lines leaving US require least 95% vaccinated board. there's racket brewing Gov Florida says he'll finr cruise lines $5000 every passenger asked proof vaccination (for ships leaving Florida). Cruises international sure that. think going cruise unless everyone vaccinated. course I've one cruise Im planning another anytime soon sure. going offer people something bit difficult acquire weed. happy rave always U.S. pays countries healthcare , partial truth valuable discussion given information available That’s sad. adenovirus-vectored vaccines still saving lives, it’s unfortunate don’t mRNA vaccines available everyone. way handled adult population vaccinations 14 days prior post Covid-19 vaccines. Maybe month? \*Googles Smith Chart\*

Nope. I'm out. Sorry, need real life passive tree Path Exile, I'm good.  fuck came 4 years could anyone claim that? bizarre thing say.

Yeah. really [two Guess stop saving retirement, hmm?  asymptomatic people. link slides? lmfao don’t know Yes, Buddha forbid lock booster ready. Every nurse met nursing homes ADN (except DON). far away treating kid gloves, trust me. 

So believe things actually barriers getting vaccinated, also want break barriers? bad imagine microchip story work out, trying something new.

If microchip theory true, we'd know, cuz nerd would already installed Linux it.

You'd think learn stuff talking experts, noo **MY 1 HOUR RESEARCH BETTER 6 YEARS**. seems like issue population then. Texas one first states open anyone 16, appointments wide open. Must people getting shots Yeah astra zeneca Didn’t lady testifying try stick key forehead? mean keys made brass aluminum, magnetic. level intelligence dealing with. makes sad. good. admit that.

Still, first still shitty approach. suspicious numbers early phase December 2019 - March 2020

The local government tried cover up. People fired.

On top lack tests government added numbers positive test available. 

The official number dead 4,636 wrong, probably 2-4 times number.

However got tests going, numbers precise.

Each time couple cases, tested millions people detect asymptomatic cases.

The draconian measures brought outbreak zero quarantine facilities massive testing avoided secondary large outbreak. I'm really sorry came day. Hopefully much spread happened.  one shot vaccination rate 39% full vaccinated

Yikes. good all. oh boy lol CPUs metal layers. idea metals use days. day, CMOS common - metal. shit, unvaccinated people risk covid 19 strains.


The fear mongering stupid unvaccinated people care anyway motivated fear first place. can't get vaccine medical reasons already care because, again, people without vaccines risk strains. brother law got covid. six months still tires pretty quickly. found likely mini stroke, dominant side actually regaining function slower rate. getting bunch tests done now. hospitalized, hospital full, would temps hit 102, told stay home bring fever down, come got 104 can't breathe. 30 :( Canada paid China $1B develop test Chinese vaccine couldn’t completed. Canada paid $0 research manufacturing Pfizer. Canada get priority US made doses? 

By way, EU blocked AZ vaccines going Australia similar laws. Germany rejected idea opening vaccines. 

Canada ain’t center world, get line, everybody grievances. here.
Düsseldorf rules general, words ""private provider"" make nervous imply pay pocket now, get reimbursed later. Plus difficult expensive get tested first year pandemic still ads/posters live advertising 20€ Schnelltests, might old.  antivax family firmly sticking this, maddening. type phony basis theory even trying push? Someone posted Richard Feynman video magnets days ago: bil insisted true broke magnet prove wrong. seriously belligerent insisting fact. County dashboard. Obviously, things great Mesa County.

*However*, hospitals full. ~90% capacity opposed usual 70% capacity, 42 people hospitalized covid.

This say hospitals fill (presumably will, nothing changes), yet.

When fill up, I'll interested see ration care. de-prioritize unvaccinated? (I doubt ethically this).

It probably going politically untenable re-impose restrictions everyone subset population refuses get vaccinated. bugs post you, mailman, neglected mention actual cause death. know guy died car crash. INCREDIBLY important piece information mailman omit he's going insinuate vaccine caused death. told omitted it, hell man? told death conversation made inference that's irresponsible.

Outside blood clot risk J&amp;J (which seems mostly issue women 50 rare hard say definitively) well known risks like anaphylaxis (which would occur within minutes easily treatable) appear links vaccines deaths. got likely. think maybe go vaccinated, going open soon. Seems unlikely open close minor outbreak. personally, I'd 0 concern. people come asked Fauci way obviously agenda.

So someone asks Fauci provoke response - offense intended :) expense vaccines little compared benefit

If assumed 15 bucks dose 2 doses person, that's 230 billion dollars fully vaccinate every person planet. seems like lot take account covid slashed trillion dollars GDP single quarter, US alone. it’s necessary safely effectively perform duties job, yep. microchip story work out, trying something new.

So coming another theory debunk 10 seconds... cannot fix stupid! husband undergoing chemotherapy major cancer surgery doctor's told go ahead get vaccine jabs. happened pre surgery chemo treatments. 3 month presurgery chemo treatment window. serious side effects, headache may related vaccine. 
From gather immune compromised/suppressed get full protective effect. still behave people vaccinated seems prudent so. immunocompromised jabs. think depends doctor's advise. people think Moderna Pfizer vaccines going give covid instead offer protection it, might want ask Dr assume vaccine detrimental. None public health related. Oh Oh, wanna share next.

There always reason USA. like finding post stack overflow asking exact question need answered one response, ""nevermind, figured out"". rare blessed stack overflow situation two answers, one explained someone saying nevermind, second came later random person ""Hey everybody knows, answer:"". isn’t donations. Exporting means countries bought vaccines.

OP asked: “Wow, US country donates vaccines?” answered. Yeah that's something I've wondering. something unique J&amp;J makes single dose effective/longer lasting say one dose Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, case approved single dose simply ran one dose trial?  Either way small sample size use cranking scare-porn story. highly misleading deliberately so.  Tourists too. Actually calculations Technocal may onto something.

Specifically around 562 million, actually closer 600 million. Vaccine passports guess. US committed purchase multiple times population donate rest. Anti-vaxxer ICU tour 2021 sponsored Delta  Vaccine doesn’t bother everyone Olympic athletes tend superhuman anyway. think actually pro-athlete response allows reap success vs canceling games missing window. don’t agree idea they’re games (seems idiotic) think it’s athlete friendly compared alternative. Well, main difference natural infection fact body sees spike protein case mRNA vaccine, versus whole virus case natural infection.

This reason say live attenuated vaccine provides natural immune response.

However, another difference natural infection current mRNA vaccines vaccines injected intramuscularly, versus infection respiratory system (and perhaps intestines) case natural infection.

I would say arguments backed simple observations yet receive satisfactory explanations. medical science based incomplete understanding body works lot empirical data fill holes.

Think way. Making vaccine like building bridge. build 40,000 bridges order certify particular bridge design safe. Why? fundamental sciences involved well understood. That's case medical world. Thats unfair say compare populations manufacturing capability. No, ANOTHER way vaccine protects people, besides direct way. that's lowering transmission.  protected, even without vaccine, enough people around vaccinated case load goes down. 

Where am, basically herd immunity. go without mask, people vaccinated. Somehow, electing people, paying salaries, housing them, securing them, feeding paying decisions doesn’t deserve mention? think credit belongs United States it’s people Biden Administration. They’re trying get halo done something admirable absolutely nothing laudable. Shhhh, US save day. Even need it. Vaccines training immune system. Overtraining thing, training, that's it. 

Breathing training, warfare. immune system designed never-ending war, absolutely still benefits training. That's vaccines one disease usually help slightly diseases - essentially call cross-training.

The healthiest people always benefit training, true vaccination. said ~90%. It’s important read carefully responding. 

88%, that’s close 90.

This ""article"" much clickbait horseshit. Michigan's economic recovery fine. state completely open wear masks Doctor's office, life pretty much back normal (for fully vaccinated least.) tourism industry got huge shot arm past Memorial Day weekend. Hotels booked, campgrounds booked I75 bumper bumper every brewery went standing room only. Makes sense. Pfizer needs make back 2.3 billion fraudulent marketing. Actually I’m honest selfish piece shit says I’m donating giving money away. mad I’m showing you’re hypocrite. won’t give money away willingly, you’re paying you’ll go jail paying taxes. don’t care people either. You’re pissant keyboard warrior wants pretend something righteous rather spend one single dollar actually virtuous person. You’re joke me, know it.

Best luck you. right now, need [2,385 open. Might actually happen week! two minds VT vs COVID. seen lot anti-mask/anti-vax BS going around area. good VT well, given I've seen area, bad rest country?!? My two favorite variant reports new data today. 


First, national CDC variant data see P1 pretty well, growing 4.8% week ended 4/24 6.3% week ended 5/8 8.1% week ended 5/22. However, overall cases going faster nationally, nationally, P1 growing percentage even total number cases likely dropping. 


Delta, India variant, B.1.617.2, grew 0.6% 1.3% 2.5%. error bars large this, looks like doubling percent total every two weeks. comparison, nationally cases went 7 day average 55,194 40,236 24904. So, extrapolating (with wide error bars), means estimated 331 cases 523 cases 622 cases. words, delta growing, doubling every 4 weeks, wide error bars. Given increases vaccination nationally past four weeks, nationally delta likely growing slow flat now, places low vaccination likely seeing growth. 


In addition, Washington state variant report out, 
P.1 13.6% week ended 5/22, 9.1% week ended May 8. That's comparable pace Washington state trending down, overall P.1 probably roughly constant based Washington State dashboard 7 day average epidemiologic curves - weeks would 110 cases P1, P1 basically flat Washington state. Elsewhere report data I've able find vaccine escapes WA elsewhere. 20% escapes P1, compared 7% P1 overall. P1 seem bit scary regard. 2% escapes Delta, compared 1% overall, numbers small draw conclusions. doses donated first 200 million doses distributed year, subsequent 300 million shared first half next year. doses distributed Covax, World Health Organization-backed initiative share doses around globe, targeted low- middle-income countries. Canada enough doses, Canada would decline offer would go somewhere else.

Thank exposing lack understanding scientific process.

Science evidence based, evidence exists increased severity default, based relevant data increase disease severity. However, data limited can’t say conclusively. However, thank proving point. You’ve named 3 mutations, who’s effects understood degree. know common? None effect disease progression, ample evidence this.

So let spell 

No evidence delta variant increases disease severity - limited data delta variant specifically + individual effect delta variant mutations + physiological effect variants carrying mutations = reason believe delta variant effect disease severity.

We know J&amp;J efficacy 64% B.1.351. means efficacy Indian variants likely LEAST 64% probably higher. reason mechanism would cause lower 64%, since B.1.351 greater immune escape capabilities.

Ask doctor, either way reason monitor 15 minutes shot. imagine emergency EpiPen standby gets bad. vaccines 1976 Swine Flu rushed production. Sound familiar?
 
it live virus vaccine rushed production.. let's repeat mistake live virus vaccine.. interesting actually. The[ PREP passed 2005 response H5N1 pandemic. meant encourage speedy innovation essentially making pharmaceutical companies immune related litigation…. US soil. Naturally, companies wanted drugs used places couldn’t get sued. So, H1N1 came around President Obama asked companies start developing vaccine, made sure contract included language essentially made PREP Act inapplicable drugs. companies fine!

But, negotiating Operation Warp Speed, Trump administration flexible agreed (to delight companies) leave PREP Act exemption language out. 

So, right… Trump signed bad contract relates liability protections. like doing. I'm sure many reasons political otherwise cares, vaccines working. 1 year old first cold couple weeks ago (in opinion) understandably worried. first born 2 months pandemic. hard keep rational brain top emotional brain sometimes trying protect children something threatening :/ 

My parents pointed kids get sick, often. try hold onto stress COVID much. go back normal levels parental worry point, right? 😮‍💨 people behind her, nodding along. I'm sure, Gamma (P.1) variant give run money, country went less 20% 90% month. lose card haha? double up?   Cases definitely way given death rate  That's gonna shitshow let down.

Not sure - going date death, indeed die course entire week. mean reported deaths days, however. Even allowing lag, seems like testing enough CFR 5-10% range, however. Symptom severity mitigation, death prevention. ones know aren’t getting following reasons. people extremely intelligent can’t figure out. 

1. Don’t trust “experimental” vaccine.
2. Odds better get sick get it.
3. Haven’t gotten sick yet exposed people it.
4. government going track you.
5. whole thing fake make Trump look bad. 
6. Vitamins ph water stronger better modern medicine. Sweet, tax dollars going major pharmaceutical corporation they’re actively stopping efforts release intellectual property free countries can’t make vaccine.

There, fixed it.  Please one slip shower bankrupt person tryna fix back lmao delusion. Again, like said: cases worldwide, chance variant develop current vaccines protect against. happens, we're back square one deaths lockdowns developing new vaccine. form health care YOU. I’ve vaccinated nearly six months now. Fully vaccinated almost five.

I’m vaccine all.

I’m forced vaccines fully approved.

Not political (what party would even be?). Wow j&amp;j tested Delta yet. trials tested South Africa, data good. Why?

Because one forced get vaccine EUA.

That’s it.

I got vaccine, earlier age spare dose left wife’s hospital early roll out, one first country get first dose, lived nightmare Covid since March 2020.

We separate early exposure, park RV front incase got sick work little PPE re-using N95’s days couldn’t bring own, transition WFH teach kids wife’s hours doubled salary stayed (something lasted 10 months, 10 months two full time jobs day week), support wife wave wave whole families got admitted hospital mid January 2021, far sick wife’s hospitals acuity, even air ambulance get open beds, could gear had.

I watched military doctor buddies got deployed country press, moving failed hospital failed hospital across rural CA Midwest, faced steady stream patients straight denied covid even getting bipap shown positive test result.

And vaccine that’s memory, making summer vacation plans, wife ZERO covid hospital, buddies home families (some vaccine distribution).

But much believe vaccines, politically neutral, check posts I’m anti-CoVID-19 anti-misinformation, can’t support people forced take vaccine that’s fully approved.

The day it’s fully approved, absolutely everyone healthcare setting, well federal employees military members vaccinate, no.  Good see case numbers exploding, however, would even better see outbreak finally ending. Also, think morally rest world owes Taiwan enough vaccines vaccinate entire population, since failure contain pandemic (like Taiwan well past year half) caused Taiwan outbreak now.    comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

This US healthcare worker study found 2 weeks second dose, chance infection decreased 90%. workers screened regularly asymptomatic infections, know vaccine prevented infections, symptoms. single dose vaccine reduced infections 80% 2 people fully vaccinated still get infected transmit, extremely unlikely. enough people vaccinated spread get low enough allow us stop masking distancing.

As aside, also decent amount research evidence suggests people true asymptomatics (as opposed pre-symptomatic) bad spreading, example reported asymptomatic cases infected 0.3% close contacts. government actively fucking labor market. think mean ""Chinese health officials noticed surge pneumonia flu-like cases"" December?

Thursday also fourth consecutive day case totals 200s, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said indicates case numbers downtrend.

However, whether trend continues remains seen, Chen said.

New Taipei reported 112 new domestic cases, highest number, followed Taipei 58 Miaoli County 43.

Taoyuan reported 14, Keelung 12, Changhua County 10, Hualien County seven, two reported Nantou Hsinchu counties. Tainan City, Yilan Taitung counties reported one case each.

The CECC said five cases unknown source infection, four investigation.

The three imported cases, meanwhile, involved Taiwanese nationals returned India, Nigeria United States.

According CECC, woman 40s returned U.S. received two doses Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine April arrived Taiwan June 3.

On June 7, woman started cough runny nose. relative staying developed fever days later tested positive COVID-19, result tested. results came back positive Thursday, CECC said.

Commenting case, CECC official Lo Yi-chun (羅一鈞) said COVID-19 vaccines highly effective preventing severe cases disease death. also help prevent asymptomatic mild infections though lesser extent.

It still possible vaccinated people become infected, though tend less infectious less viral load unvaccinated patients, Lo said.

The 28 deaths reported Thursday 21 men seven women, aged 50 100, passed away June 1 June 9, according CECC.

To date, Taiwan confirmed total 12,222 COVID-19 cases, 10,500 domestic infections reported since May 15, country first recorded 100 cases single day.

The number confirmed COVID-19 deaths country risen 361, including 349 recorded since May 15, CECC data shows.

(By Chiang Yi-ching) J&amp;J spent significant $$$$$ preclinical phase optimize dosage one-dose vaccine. formula different. also uses different Ad vector, different version spike protein AZ.

That said, I’d also like data J&amp;J know go get Pfizer Moderna (although considering J&amp;J well trials SA Brazil, maybe we’ll okay). vaccine fact significantly reduce chances infected all, prevent severe disease. certain total number cases substantially higher number confirmed cases. Aren’t spike proteins coronaviruses? That’s makes coronaviruses - spikes look like crown (corona). Yes, know it’s filmed VA hospital greater Los Angeles area, there’s thing GSMH, hospital plagued, George never got hit bus joining military.

That’s joke.

The real reason Seattle’s first get 70% vaccinated Microsoft Bellevue, Seattle suburb, insider knowledge Bill Gates vaccines actually stop 5G infecting us CoVID19. it’s hush-hush using reverse psychology try get middle America vaccinate quickly depopulated fly country turn middle America back natural state. Plenty people go nuts age. I'm Ohio. confirm. what’s point then? age groups permitted get extremely high numbers people want it. many doses binned people want miss Wow that's definitely comforting title  staff aren’t working Europe.

They working US vaccines still EUA.

Formality not, people shouldn’t forced get vaccine.

Although, fully support private business thinks best, employees really forced vaccinate, move hospitals and/or areas country. Bet accidentally bought masks Pfizer 88% effective delta variant. No, you’ll downvoted post garbage, bots. Countless studies shown vaccines fact reduce transmission spread virus great deal.  Scientists haven’t past said vaccines stop/reduce transmission spread that’s trials tested for, thus wasn’t shown. likelihood always would reduce transmission fact shown many studies real world numbers.

As far UK goes, let’s put perspective.  vaccines, seeing upwards 50k cases day more.  ‘spiking’ 7k cases day. large majority cases people aren’t vaccinated received one dose vaccine.  numbers favour vaccinations, especially full vaccination...    still get COVID vaccinated estimation percentage Tucker's viewers real risk dying covid? 1%, 2%? think good illustration need constantly montor adjust local situations. Stockholm Sweden probably chose herd immunity right now. is, factor seasonal effect, natural vaccine immunity measures place. Cases rapidly falling. Stockholm likely close herd immunity broad introduktion delta variant winter mitigating measures all. Somewhere temporary sweetspot hope find balance risk sickness, death overburdened health care system pandemic fatigue populations.

Its extremely important keeping assessments beeing politicized much possible. alarmists deniers feeds this, lets give air. US pay development vaccine, though. Operation Warpspeed offer money, Pfizer/BioNTech declined.

The funding BioNTech came Fosun, Pfizer, EU German government. earliest funding (totalling $320 million) came private companies. companies took huge risk so, betting lots money novel technology new virus dozens competitors developing vaccines.

Take away gain profit successful vaccine fewer companies would ready take risks future (when next pandemic comes).  mean could fly states right would get family get vaccine can’t :( post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I.e admitting patients struggling bit convalescing opposed serious risk death?

In previous waves verrrrry sick admitted.

I'm saying CASE. I'm saying possible. looked into, imagine people smarter are. hope somebody shed light scenario unlikely happen paper sounds scary trust scientists they're looking matter now. 


In case, Singapore government also warned COVID stay forever adjust thinking scenario. Joe go around office everyone throw million dollars each?

It’s money spent. Would nice get credit instead spun political propaganda. going get jab ... got high -Has nanomachines microchips

The vaccine nightmares sounds kinda neat tbh. Canadians strongly encouraged report vaccinations done abroad local health unit and/or province could added daily total. USA benefits massively imperial history neo-colonialism. US west large plundered glibal south, maybe every country could afford vaccine. that's world live in. makes sense.

There’s way issue mandate followed every country (not even countries, imagine trying get special access 100+ countries).

That's nice. know businesses still shutting days potential outbreaks hapoening there, state higher vaccinations most.

Shutting days costs lot money...any business owner brain say get vaccine gtfo point. Plus people getting vaccinated shows poor judgement ignorant are...not exactly qualities want employees.  It’s steam! know? article mentioned finger amputations, heard (leg amputations yes, common all). disseminated coagulation cascade caused virus could definitely worsened variant exhibiting increased viral load. “…but I’d rather spend billions protecting world billions bombing it.” 

This right friend. Churches too, there's couple churches predominantly Hispanic areas telling people get vaccine government putting microchips people track deport them.

Garbage knew barely nothing efficacy single dose time UK made decision disregard tested dosage windows , exactly objection many people strategy. UK guessing, latest spike unfortunate result. Mediterranean assume departed European port, hell country require vaccine certificate go cruise don’t know you’d already set getting mRNA zero clotting risk. no-brainer.

I know ComCov trials taking long publish, think maybe started later. I'd shocked found anything starkly different papers.  Anecdotes may powerful way. there's someone 2 degrees social connection away, passed away especially vulnerabilities, tend take seriously.

“Many demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), medical specialty, medical history, smoking status, BMI significantly differ severity COVID-19. HCWs moderate-to-severe COVID-19 severity less likely report followed plant-based diets (8.6% mild mild cases vs 2.9% moderate-to-severe cases; p=0.02) likely report followed low carbohydrate, high protein diets (table 1, 14.2% mild mild cases vs 21.7% moderate-to-severe cases; p=0.04).” country make vaccine isn't? last checked, anyone capability so, already so. J&amp;J producing coronavirus vaccine shots cost, significantly cheaper Pfizer. effectiveness, vaccines similar rates protection, many studies showed vaccinated population region similar level protection regardless vaccine manufacturer. 100% is. state governor literally outlawed colleges safe possible come Fall. allowed mask mandate. required return person.

Texas HHS data shows college age students lowest vax percentage. talking low basically 15%.

UT System colleges lots state international students.

Yes, $500 million bucks. recent research, asymptomatic people much less likely shed virus. means symptoms week, unlikely spread virus even infected unknowingly. person visiting also vaccinated, makes risk almost non-existent. give $1 Pfizer develop vaccine. dont know much clear get this. I'll try again. Maybe reason confused conflating claim belief claim fact. acting like thing. somebody claiming know either came lab nature yes false narrative. conclusive facts either position. acting like belief zoological origin fact people believe came lab also stating fact. Saying believe something happened saying know something happened. promoting belief fact. not. actually 6% respond. vaccine lowers risk 94% baseline. similar said, technically quite different. Yeah, excited start kindergarten year, finally get play kids. Buuut found school online person options, likely one other. planning online vaccinated, go person, sounds like might able switch next year *sigh*  Government funded mRNA research already public domain. Try again. 

Not fault takes 7 years average build vaccine factory decades experience produce mRNA vaccine sufficient numbers. 

Easier buy vaccines cost people already give away. goal get shots arms. Fully vaccinated Americans currently travel Italy, Greece, France, Spain. definitely education problem. 20% US adults illiterate. 50% can't read 8th grade level. expect people grasp information properly many know reading. makes sense facebook memes misinformation grab ahold many people generally simple easy digest. think world lockdown helping us tax payers?

Apparently we, vaccinated people may infect unvaccinated people weird diseases bloodcloths good news  Lithuania government decided buy 650k J&amp;J top current order 650k 

The rationale makes sense:

* Current vaccine supplies enough vaccinate whole population
* J&amp;J able manufacture doses quickly enough compared Pfizer Moderna
* Viral Vector vaccines might good booster shots compared mRNA: slow manufacturing, unpopular among public.
* top people might become immune vector itself, means need kind vector booster shots Vaccines science. Magnetism magic.

We mostly do, a) workers often aren’t *required* vaccinated, b) elderly weaker immune systems begin may achieve immune response someone younger. also tend one comorbidities. I'd worry going going get house. Real estate selling insane prices (like 100k + cases) actual value desirable areas.

/s you’re vaccinated point, bad

You realize everyone privilege go get vaccinated? $365K die. medical expenses fully reimbursed.

It could absolutely better, could general civil settlement amounts medical injury. They're trying fair.  think saying that, opened sooner, much crazy spread FB outlets vaccine became available, number vaccinated area would higher? 

I feel making big deal getting 2nd shot Pfizer Moderna. nutters, get early, make feel like they're somehow exclusive group yet include others less fortunate them, jab wherever stand. Make easy. start hearing stories 2nd shot laying people day two, least they're already jabbed one less person spread to. time they're sticking metal objects body, they're hopefully least 50% effectiveness one shot. 

It's basically calculus of, ""let's strike jab people KNOW gonna say things like, 'the shot magnetizes makes communicable 5g antennas"" get many idiots possible still possible make feel like they're special. Cause they're special right...

But no... big problem U.S. extensively covered begin ever-so-slowly reach stage assess pandemic historical perspective, certain measures would helped, scientific community, media, often government well took almost too-cautious approach would say, ""the evidence aerosols (it was, read Linsey Marr AMA sidebar)"", ""the evidence masks circumspect"", shot works get two doses. gave actual data already done countries, still stuck close script found NEW things alarmist about. 

It's cycle absurdity I'm saying someone like lady right need kow-tow lunatics. I'm saying there's psychological angle everything, U.S. fails psychological angle many regards laughable. msm, again, one worst perpetrators, case, coddling people short period takes get needle arm move bullshit like whack job sticking keys neck (?????)  Biden? fault people want vaccinated. much say get them. Unfortunately, it’s nurse thinks this. Sure. evidence pointing natural? evidence used suggest lab leak? Sackler Family would like word…  I'm going home sticking spoon nose tonight. sure. It’s still government mandated curriculum public schools. separate school boards. Mostly agree comment. might also ad getting vaccinated. part really concerns FDA said meeting today don’t study document Covid vaccine could potentially interact regular vaccine schedule kids already given. Big yikes. Speak please. Oh interesting. Basically charter schools then? mother MRI's well second shots. holes arms metal getting pulled machine.  mention (sask) catholic schools publicly funded private schools. private religious schools either religions sects Christianity. statement, scientific, timing, two minutes podcast, Dr Griffin goes pessimistic modeling published JAMA pan out. Cases actually dropping exponentially mask mandates lifted highly vaccinated society achieved. anecdote lifting mask mandates leading increased vaccinations. I’m sure truth teased time whether type messaging effective, far data supporting lifting mask mandates cause increases cases, America.

Not America much world, collectivist ideal tackle pandemics seem like pipe dream due tribal divide within nations. Surely someone going come data one it’ll interesting see effects! Heh.. hate break 😬 us States half population two shots far ...... guess depends live....

Ken Bastida shows us ***one site Stanford, 2000 families signed 200 available slots.*** also go way; free wear... Wait minute! mandates!

Such freedoms one way street. kindred spirit give ""if could mutant powers"" answer every time. Magneto slaps Medical privacy prevents reporting this, know 21 claims February 16. impossible file claim, people injured, recovered, gotten around filing. relatively simple prove: show cerebral venous sinus thrombosis taking Johnson Johnson vaccine myocarditis taking mRNA vaccine. one those, injured vaccine.

Side effects injuries. terms program relatively generous compared settlement get pharmaceutical company long legal fight, still prove case beyond preponderance evidence. actually think Catholic schools give pretty good solid education. people attend religious reasons. They're basically cheaper private schools. call Dr. Dime? Someone’s mad. stayed home yours. mainstream message before, 2020. reason country open schools pandemic ""because kids affected spread it"". least that's told us back then. retrospect, seems irresponsible, then.

The restrictions explanations change time though, however fits agenda. everyone updated latest. live Jefferson County Ohio. would shocked many people believe bullshit. kids indeed gotten ill died Covid, statistically unlikely. Kids mostly concern vector transmission, population at-risk hospitalization. 
Also adults travel directly interact people outside communities. Kids tend interact peers neighborhood. there's high vaccination rate adults given school district kind form cocoon around kids. [Buffalo population 1.1M living county full loons? Seems like get along anyways. literally said get close 75% adults get 60% everybody never said pass 60% adults Absolutely. triggering diabetes lot people. dad diabetes nervous got vaccine.

Diabetes brutal system. attacks brain, nerves, kidneys, liver. get UTI's constantly. lot diabetics die sepsis UTI's. take insulin fine. brutal. mean Buffalo proper. Google says, ""Buffalo–Cheektowaga–Olean Combined Statistical Area home 1,215,826 residents."" Funniest SNL skit date. That's I'm saying... like... can't even... even pretend try discuss things people like this? lives alternate reality. many others. feel like trying explain rather walk away people bother discussing things like.... ahem... ""becoming magnetized cause vaccine, dummeh!"", show video. best bother. 

They far gone hopeless even attempt kind good faith discussions negotiations interaction whatsoever. How's cases? take Wendy's ask manager   think go way? Booker playing good. Poland since June 7th. larger percentage antivaxxers need everyone get though. :) Wow looks like different opinions constitutes good news  first weird, conservative decision either. Well hopefully around long then, clearly one miss define Zero covid?

I'd say zero community spread possible. vaccinating 12 year olds Poland since days. Underrated comment lol goal get shots arms people. Giving IP away within 5 years. that's pointless. Y'all Sputnik V vaccine there? walk places spout random bullshit time? agree everything said. mainly dislike continual notion “we’re together” it’s global effort yet protecting companies developed vaccine. 

Obviously building site scratch would far long doubt countless facilities globally could start manufacturing doses received blueprint manufacture. 

It’s farce yet US taxpayers foot bill expense corporate profits.  Please don't, Canadian job market tech sucks worse Vermonts housing market significantly worse. Hopefully universities themselves, often competently run politically opposite state legislature, least get vaccine distribution going campus. 
Like, may start school year bad shape local outbreaks, get vaccine easily available students/staff bunch probably take it. Mister T-Cell pities fool thinks he’s mutating way ass-kicking. children choice. can't wearing mask anyone else's kid I'm pro mask...just anti kid. overstate population Vermont, larger give credit. point fact, twice metropolitan Buffalo, NY. 620,000 260,000. That's part it.  first thing pops name searched Google probably help future job prospects. Right? wish did. poor-man's Magneto would fun. BC I've read, Pfizer best vaccine (so far).

This chart far definitive, stubborn, grouchy grandma COVID nursing home says get again. talk it, still refuses vaccine. anti-social long vaccinated go group activities, fine her. delight  ew, David. joke. gross. sure taught magnets science. Bio class high school could take, bio basics still thing science classes leading it. also remember science classes learning vaccines work well. Care homes facilities tough. Could pay more? Sure. World help much? Probably not.
 
The issue genuinely horrible work. There's practically amount money could pay would get job.
 
I honestly can't think many jobs I'd consider worse working care home. TIL! then, make magnetic holders phones...I thought that. 


But I'm wondering heavy object stick woman's sweaty chest.... Yeah years long trials, they? effectively wishing death upon people here? Something wish upon worst enemy? (and people even enemy)...

You must great person around.

Thank you. I’m sick constant division too. little late party.  Even countries supposed much better education systems USA fuck ton idiots. 

I swear high school people lose knowledge learned. see many people struggle even basic concepts understand even elementary student could figure out. 

Like don’t get wrong it’s probably education, serious people treat school feel tons people one else dumb. idiots know never tried HS, dead end jobs skills hate world. That’s school system/gov imo. really frustrating knowing Covid know US could essentially month ago. espoused mature sentiment like earlier May spoken to...but, month later still say Fuck 'Em. FYI, telling someone ""calm down"" civil discussion nothing inflame would otherwise respectful peaceful exchange. 100% calm lol. So, guess disagree. CI level AZ's absolutely inadequate nothing extracted it, agree. CI gap 37%, ideal, still tight enough think absolutely make extrapolations it. Right I'm confused all. think opinion scientific fact. isn't, taking dump scientific process presenting this. impartial base opinions evidence. think true.  course never it. exist. 

It's really funny though. honestly don’t know PU letter is. need 1 flight ticket 2 PCR+igm testing result. Good luck finding job paying $20+/hr Southern Vermont. show off! We're getting point covid going illness dumb ignorant. Vaccines easy get USA Canada. we're getting point mostly going spread amongst dumb ignorant.

Yep research UPenn licenses technology. one several critical breakthroughs achieved U.S. several universities Ya 88% related Delta. never know sure, much due diligence possible important we'll move ""% certainty"" needle 
one way another. Thank you! got flack wearing mask elevator Mesa county. I’m surprised headline. That's including people eligible vaccine. percent people 12+ least one dose 54.44%, 44.53% fully vaccinated. saying that's much better, I'd argue better reflects vaccination rates rather including people can't even get yet. mention massive majority human population suddenly dying would collapse WORLD economy.

God help woman becomes nurse. Paywall! there’s better evidence Singapore UK vaccinated people fact spread virus infected

Interesting--care share links? might find own. think real problem presenting binary question: ""do vaccinated people spread covid not?"" That's never pandemics vaccines work; work terms probabilities, absolutes. whenever community spread--which great probability *multiplier*--is high, even vaccinated people need opportunity change baseline public health better

Oh, mean like masking indoors public significant flu activity? I'm interested that. Yes, CDC could promote that. one encouraging development, cat's bag masks. we've wear them, look weird anymore know they're objectively hard wear. think flu-season masking reach covid. brag, stick spoon nose. Stuff sticking grandpa covid shot. Again, potato. actually 93 variants 88% delta variant. gets even better keep wearing mask. That’s actually far off. New Hampshire lot libertarians feel like rest New England. least Georgia, looks (very high level) glance association education income level vaccine uptake. Georgia DPH vaccination dashboard actually lets go way vaccination rates per census tract (which city Atlanta basically allows neighborhood neighborhood comparisons uptake):  


While vaccine uptake Fulton County (where majority Atlanta resides) whole sits 43% first shots (with state whole 41%), easy find wealthier census tracts uptakes 60%+ first shots (particularly Northern Eastern city neighborhoods suburbs), poorer census tracts (to West South) first shot uptakes sometimes 10% even less. political thing either, basically whole area (including areas high low vaccine uptake) heavily democratic leaning. I'm entirely sure gets fixed, state Georgia least appear really trying anything despite article saying ""ample"" incentives. bit complex schools. ton misinformation propaganda spread world worms way people's heads would contribute paranoia conspiracy science, authority, government.

""Fek kids"" consensus ;) nature thing, going feel like happening whether happening not. give anything 100 million people, going drop dead shortly receiving it. That's clinical trials experts carefully monitor trend disease correlated vaccination. Eric Ding professional fearmonger. kid 5, high risk. niece 5, not. sister upset wont let kids hang out, even though adults vaccinated. Sorry sorry sis, daughter soccer dance goes indoor trampoline center lot, can't tell sure catch vaccinated. That's true. Unfortunately think county going get much higher we're currently. live fairly conservative county we've got good number dummies get that. Plus high percentage hispanic residents also low vaccination rate. That’s amazing! guy Magnetos Unfortunately, seems common knowledge article's target audience (Australians), never says. Based article guess National Disability xxx Service. Canada crossed Israel vaccinated country sufficient size (currently 63% entire population 1+ doses), sign slowing down. curious see much able contain done vaccination everyone gets second dose. Could get 0 cases?? Yup. Even UK see cases climbing again. 

Delta beast. got Pfizer second dose knocked ass two days… really tired sore. I’m someone usually takes naps sleeping time.

Oh yeah smoke weed helped lot soreness. gonna look excel sheet, made writing comment. Made comparison US, Germany Netherlands terms per capita daily vaccination, first doses second doses rate. add UK check. doubt Germany able catch UK anytime soon. take Germany already around month catch US.  Politics dictate mask mandates never happen states. State legislatures went wild limiting executive power too. next phase could particularly brutal. Docs burned out. Every single ICU credentialed doc employed 2019 resigned wife’s hospital past 18 months. waiting case counts dipped low, area seemed going way party spread disease sick it.

We left too, sucked much.

My buddies deployed hated Steady Stream denial. Never military deployed doctors stateside volume, yet patients still denial friends admitting determining reasonable chance living. literally battle field triage US people still deny happened.

""no understand *vaccine* magnetism -- works copper"" How's what? Shit man might go Vermont. I'm sick Georgia uk slow supply constraints? 

The whole EU well Germany. real hero BioNtech. really saved ass. don’t need know position past tax cuts, seeing purchase vaccines causes outrage. It’s kind like, ‘if bothers really piss off’. evolve something

""Donald Trump put counter-vaccine drinking water, glory Trump"" Getting 60% overall implies hoping get 70-75% adults though 60% adults incredibly ignorant. could send thousand hours lectures immunology would wasted imbecile say more:

You lead healthy lifestyle get covid vaccine. surprising honest. think Netherlands going route. recommended 12+ health conditions (people also eligible flu vaccine).

And also understandable, countries already achieving high vaccination grades without vaccinating children deem completely getting rid COVID-19 possible anyways. question is, much benefit vaccinating children end benefit children themselves. probably even important, want give vaccine children virus minimal effect children achieve something might possible without vaccinating children.

In essence: worth using children ""tool"" prop vaccination numbers? Far many people think easy this. banning vaccines healthy children, recommending it, needed children. Probably Georgia LOL covid still alive well here, vaxx rates lowest country. make sense me. would think forced wear PPE protect would point of, ""No I'm wearing quit!"" Phase. wore agreeance real want protect themselves. look solution (vaccine) say way! protected externally, say internally? but…if people dead, can’t give money pharm companies. make make sense seems like stop requiring evidence believe things (e.g. become Christian) willing believe sorts nonsense.  Unfortunately teaching critical thinking spotting hoaxes would considered political nowadays. idea dude expressing disapproval tax cuts mentioned occurred. That's pretty big assumption make.

Now, may much better point say deficit spending much better idea tax cuts past much larger impact deficit.

But then, might forced go back also analyze deficit spending efficient effective could make fair balanced point. aggressive response.. 

Texas huge state. still well prepared. population apparently doesn’t care, failure point states management vaccine program. Germany catch uk? even possible reach 80% sadly true Anyone who's ever sat coin wearing shorts knows stick really well sweaty skin. Fucking magnets, work tho?? Well quite close. ask people personal information. talk you. [However, information readily available CDC's mentioned would significantly impactful - sick wearing masks stop spread. talking you, hope.

I gave two cents (worth much online forum anyways) personal desire wear masks still.

I clearly said want do. ***You*** whatever makes ***you*** feel comfortable. ***no impact*** life ***you*** wear mask. quote CDC: pandemic, cloth masks may option available; however, used last resort medical masks respirators available (3). Cloth mask use mandated healthcare workers, may choose use alternatives (30). Protection affected proper mask use well selection fabric design masks water resistance, filtration, fit. Current evidence suggests multilayered masks water-resistant fabric, high number threads, finer weave may protective (3,10). Several studies examined filtration, fewer examined fit water resistance. Surgical masks normally rated fluid resistance, cloth masks too. Masks able prevent stream fluid flowing pressure 160 mm Hg seeping mask potentially mouth. Furthermore, degree fit affects effectiveness air flows direction least resistance; gaps present sides mask, air flow gaps instead mask.

If using correct type fabrics good seal face could protecting yourself, probably much. really protect viruses others would need least N95 mask (N100 preferred). want ***REALLY*** protect everything air get P100 mask (strong oil resistance). masks good re-use get expensive.

Have great day. Nobody, mean noooobody could seen coming, right? 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️ reality we're living Canada well. Doubt it.

Yes Germany catch USA, that’s people US government bad job.

I think catch uk time soon. Obviously eventually catch ones basically done running problems USA now.

They opened 30 yo uk it’s crazy many people applied. said 3 times higher before. g people really part. think Germany. someone lives 15min Canadian border annoyed won’t even give reopening date. even vaccinated people. I'm aware Dunning Kruger effect. try make ignorant want covid shot. personal choice. Like someone else said agree with. much easier people get shot actually make fundamental changes lifestyle make healthier. gurantee fall former category. Phoenix Suns played great game basketball last night  narrative saying space sexond doses strategy work.

But did. Incredibly well too. Got downvoted heck asking people still wear masks kids helped protect *adults* last 15 months.

The shocking thing “food desert” stories 8% US population lives 1 mile store fresh produce. That’s *incredibly* good access. would interesting see hoops jump try explain vaccine makes magnetic. I’m half tempted record sticking plastic glass objects myself. good workout sweat could definitely it. Yea, like 2 million supposed used vaccinate teachers... Life goal now: Survive 5 years ton people waiting they're able day two necessary, really struggling find time.

Of course covid take longer, already it? person who's already works couple jobs takes care kids rest time probably huge hurry feel sick couple days, blaming helping. also ton students waited/are waiting finals over.

Obviously think wrong, entitled opinion, mean people exactly claim happening. finished Phase II trial. FDA saying give EUA antibody data better AZ's antibody data, even without Phase III trial. guess need vaccine expert tell us whether theory really makes sense not. could apply remote jobs. people always make logistics complicated matter much try scale properly. moving parts things go wrong, taking time. problem lack supply Ok. let's lift restriction well... get saying, that's pretty low bar. 

It really require special knowledge. kid, everyone around age loves play magnets try different things. Or, maybe someone seen [magnetic key \-- would probably know. Yup. want confront bad shit US Gov done internationally lots end hospital puts pressure health services. affects everyone.

Safety #1 factor, followed effectiveness reducing viral load children hosts. clinical endpoints (hospitalization, shortness breath, etc) used efficacy trials adults less relevant. oh man lmaoo fight conspiracy even deeper conspiracy HOLY SHIT MEANT 95% EFFECTIVE? vaccines started trialing human gestation period ago now. looked yesterday curiosity, 4000 babies born moms got pregnant getting vaccinated. So, goes hypothesis. That's made healthcare workers afraid rare side effects choose different career path. TBH, infection another possibility vaccine-resistant avoidant variant. Thankfully given current rate mutation able push booster shot late. Vermont hit 80% got single shot j&amp;j may able get 2 shots pfizer/moderna. read this. nutty shit people come next? batches plants fine, it’s ones particular US plant aren’t usable due production/safety issues specific facility I’m hearing sometime around November 2-5 October 5-11.

For moment, wanted move Ireland. 🐕‍🦺 woman back darting eyes real star here. Come Canada. Lets compare shall we?  YAY use new found magnetic powers cure disease. Maybe get MRI vision?? Let spin around sure..  new report came covid-19 may cause diabetes. likely sticking sweaty... Women needs take bath preferable stay stop performing anything medically related. I’m sure many they’re projecting like 80%, every country strong supply, takes weeks build immunity (especially two-dose), might still young home countries, may allergy/other issues... plus I’m sure unwilling risk side effects might impact training/performance (even though catching covid obviously risks too) Oh god, I'm jealous. county live we're still 37 percent fully vaxxed. So, uh, think may accidentally thrown away vaccination card packing move. do? (USA) Maybe could ask government would want kill primarily compliant Democrats, point would make sense vaccinate compliant protect virus they'll release years get rid ""patriots"". seems pretty obvious unless you’re moron

The one talked excited got vaccination first shot too. counting days next shot. 

Hospital jainators probably smarter nurse! Lucky. Queensland become available 40+.  got downvoted last comment saw comment worded weird.

I’m Virginia healthcare worker know many people ARENT getting vaccine. literally got screamed TODAY conspiracies vaccines. hope mandate them, weed nonsense make place safer.

Screw that! level responsibility healthcare setting sure. Sorry hear that...

There also several health issues came COVID-19. mental health physical health issues.

For example, people ""recovered"" covid breathing problems. One friends said could run used to... get tried end heavy breathing. tested, said compelety recovered COVID-19 lungs still healing. really newsworthy; know happens, rate extremely low. She'll also mild case worst, thanks vaccine. much antivaxer, chose put themself risk. can’t force people anything, morally wrong. try convince them. point nothing else let face consequences. That's cause kick ass! can’t, they’d leave people fuck alone, want control. insane amount push behind vaccine exact reason many people don’t trust it. 1 billion spent Biden Admin **advertising** vaccine... Fails prove . . . what?
Is thing people think? Statistical math. It’s beast. Let’s say example virus infected 50% people without vaccine, introduced vaccine 95% effective rate. would expect 95% fewer infections vaccinated group. would 2.5% vaccinated group we’d expect see infected. (This simplification, see 6% failure rate isn’t 6% people.) 

In real world numbers, far, we’re seeing 0.1% vaccinated people getting sick enough seek treatment. Personally, I’m comfortable that. grandma set risk tolerance. took everything laugh

I understand restraint people need someone laugh fucking face dumb shit is. know it’s crazy. PA spring surge peaked April 6k cases one day. 7 day average 500 it’s still going down.

So suppose using J&amp;J [this example], statistically approximate vaccine response one group using vaccine another smaller sample number.

Quite honestly long ends getting used, doesn’t really matter market ends on, seeing donating “The World”. get shot 100 times become Magneto? nothing then? THIS. telling people every time say ""how many people think way?!"" serious education problem US. bad tough, break realism every show yet try atay serious. First, cite source this: illegal mandate use drug, drug, FDA approved.

Then, explain us difference EUA full approval, words, without googling first. hear you! hoping avoid increase it’s also looking like US reached point vaccination rates going decrease. hopeful full FDA approval leads work requirements. I’d love see states get 70% confident will, hope it’s time keep increase bay. 12+ mark actually 72% according NYT.

San Francisco CA, Santa Clara CA, Middlesex also higher vaccination rates King WA add responses: lot Americans cannot handle nuance took statements as, ""people preexisting conditions higher risk death COVID"", mean, ""Only old, sick, fat people need worry COVID."" since think ""healthy"", need change anything lives!

Also, social media post shared screenshot CDC website captioned, ""Even CDC admits COVID dangerous, 6% people actually dying COVID."" post took long time understand talking looked screenshot, actual CDC website (because verify sources), see CDC ""admitting"" anything. realized people stupid look definition ""comorbidity"", know meaning prefix, ""co"". CDC data showing 94% COVID deaths least one known comorbidity, 6% COVID deaths known comorbidity. commodities present nearly half US population. reason believe next generation Americans going even worse thanks ""education"" system. Sue Bird would like word you. all, current WNBA champs. ah, see stupid libertarians showed tired copypasta Yes, I've experience Berlin. travelling another Bundesland tomorrow help family member moving house pop around corner get test leave – almost waiting times easy sign up.

That’s number people refuse vaccinate.  ""Why would sling mud someone job"" going next response, remembered many people throwing shit Fausci job.  Magneto? Sign up. ""democracy"" 350 million people plutocrats control electoral process media.

US Democracy scam. modern democracies are.

The true democracy local.   buy mean decided spend tax payers money  Uh oh, helping people. There’s political party won’t happy this. Yeah least 6 months shortage easily obtain KN95/N95/FFP2/FFP3 masks, public messaging could adapted better would assume that's probably case anymore Seriously? That’s crazy . One coworkers believed it, let test me, shut quickly.

I also told disappointed lack mutant abilities 5g coverage. Luckily, donate directly federal us know much contribute. two variants first found India. think Kappa variant also first found India. Well yeah, that's 'pan' part word means Wait 20% unvaccinated sick dying hospitals begin fill say that. Again, us vaccinated people safe, government something sick. can’t ignore them. That’s great! world leaders act. Welcome back US. 8.1/100,000 scary part. jump 4/100,000 8/100,000 scary part. Like said, time tell. could blip, could another wave. 

Anyone says know virus next someone listen.  downvotes clear also sling mud. There’s really need wearing masks outside  Big true variant pops vax doesn’t stop

People need stop acting though possibility going another lockdown, bro.  LOL, getting tested week work. surprise surprise. Healthy person results negative test. spend 15m waiting results... Like lots things, feel became talking point people continue say regardless whether it’s true. It’s also easier use excuse you’re someone doesn’t want change ways (source: former fat guy used excuse years) stop thinking donation, cheap investment allowing everyone get back normal. everyone given opportunity get vaccine none us truly safe. economic cost pandemic far higher paying several billion vaccines. 
Think much (western) governments paid support cost vaccines pales comparison. * true need good Karma U.S... Good job Biden Ah yes, i'm sure ""the reason stupid"" hold court. That's end argument?

At young age infants rely mothers antibodies. stops, they’re adaptative immune systems (like humoral immune system), produces repertoire immature B cells undergo clonal expansion exposed pathogen B cell receptor recognizes. expansion process take you’re first exposed novel pathogen. Overtime, selection occurs B plasma cells produce antibodies greater avidity (binding tightness epitope).

If don’t get exposed pathogens, many common childhood illnesses contracted later on, you’re immune system hasn’t time refine response (like selecting greater avidity). result common childhood infections, may even produce symptoms, contracted much severe cause serious complications.

In words, yes-social distancing good young children.

There whole string comments almost old one calling republicans stupid. hinting it, one literally says: hesitant get vaccinated they’re fucking stupid.

For reason AutoMod missed these.  happened 3‽ wtf vaccine *IS* training immune system. know fight thing yet. 

Get vaccinated. That’s national debt works Belief position held without fact.

You see contradiction here? rather ""owner USD"" since paid taxation via inflation printing currency. Prices increase buying power dollar decrease. Gimme Magnetism!! Nope, vaccines solution. I'm putting mask protect unvaccinated idiots, buttercup. global pandemic, already variants nations would likely mutate overwhelm current vaccines, go lockdown again. already got done taking care ability help world. not. people United States did. administration chose spend money spent think could well surplus given vast amounts US government ordered.  need them, see reason give away. would give first Canada Mexico, Central South America. us looking forward vaccine approval 12 under, also reach overly concerned impact COVID them. Obviously, exceptions health issues hospitalization rate COVID 12 close zero (.01%). Lol work Amazon guess they're something similar. hesitant get vaccinated they’re fucking stupid.

A comment stating 4 hours old.  automod might lunch break?  Yeah. Georgia 33.4% Vaccination rate right Pay debts set seriously think Social Credit System China Yeah, label ""loaning"" doses Canada Mexico political cover make feel palatable US citizens. 

It’s dumber that. contracts Trump administration signed explicit forbid selling giving away doses. Loaning literally option available Biden.  Amazon Calgary, Alberta. work friends do. need bot information! Everytime see ""chomping"" cringe teeny bit historical inaccuracy. Thanks putting eloquently! Ummm....are saying administration make purchase?? Don’t see screenshot donating either looking first doses? numbers look way worse Germany comparing total doses per capita? 1/14 world 2 doses pretty huge number

Is reason j&amp;j pick? sure intentionally trying manipulate data mentioning first dose, unaware vaccines 2 doses, US achieved Germany's per capita doses administered way back April. Good, I'll pay Get vaccinated Yeah great US stopped blocking shipments paid for, forcing ship Europe. Thanks solid... integrated supply chain lessons... Good. NGL expecting start spouting hospitals fudging numbers somehow pull huge profit. direct source, even know find numbers easily. Also, 3 day thing probably entirely accurate, Mom probably dumbed spend 2 hours explaining convoluted system works lol. probably getting point across make money covid patients government help. covid patients week more, get intubated even longer.

What's funny got people mainly republican complaining ""Ohh, Hospitals profiting virus unfair means!"". That's pretty good string logic, shows fault profit system. soon mention single payer/UHC, scream communism. So, guess lose/lose situation. No. many vaccines produced, otherwise north west Europe would done too.   wars? talking about? Reddit liberals live little world, swear problem price right now, problem scaling manufacturing demand otherwise Europe would done too.  final warning get risk termination duration COVID-19 (which could forever thanks idiots).  mask work equally well farts *aaaaand* wuhan  new name aims easier remember without using countries name. love used US military example excessive expenditure. Russia behind, Russians refuse vaccinate. Russian authorities even trying incentivize offering free ice cream shot, people willing anyways. Mostly skeptical government anything creates. Isn’t Winnipeg that’s bad, infection hot spots? imagine one populations targeted US bombing want inject people vaccine?  


US: Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Libia, Syria... free vaccines!!!

Victims: Uhhhhhh, thanks. source that? haven’t found anything immune escape yet That's good guy America remember! Fuck yeah! I'm shocked. allergies result anaphylactic shock shellfish. vaccine, made wait little longer people, it. Also totally fine, hurt talk doctor need peace mind. start $500 like 75% go $100 every 1% that. People would drag everyone get max payout would $3,000 hit 100% I'm math right ($500+$2500 potential). We'd never hit max payout even would nothing relative would get us. mean fuck anyone expect?

The cruise industry really needs take hard look mirror seriously change game.

Sadly huge source tourism income lot places double-edged sword think still kinda needs there.

But get shit together! lab accident “anti-Chinese” wet market alternative not?  Africa pretty good, lack testing. Deaths lot largely inexplicable. win? lol thanks. USA! USA!

Imma let Darwin sort out… Looking forward delta surge 👍 Yes agree too. People still scared.  mRNA cannot enter nucleus, two nucleic acids never place cell. Process — mRNA DNA.

No, don't. think great decision, thankful hope see it.

I criticizing you. Yeah really care specifically help originally surplus hoarding, helps people around world get vaccinated good thing Lmaooo straw man argument. thank people community. Graduates don’t say “thank Mr mayor budget” — thank town board education elected officials fear new variant resistant vaccine spreading throughout country. That’s it’s important people get vaccinated comment made think maybe purchased replenish surplus donate current stock running shelf life. Dont mean american taxpayers buy vaccines   lot specially country can't afford vaccine. country wealthy need donations Time kick piece shit government out. AU money enough buy vaccines Pfizer/BioNTech would gladly deliver, bothered ordered almost year earlier did. Interesting argument, Pfizer Moderna saying opposite. They're saying companies allowed make publicly funded vaccines, lose money...

Their multiple countries companies asking permission right now, I'm sure would say them.

But saying allowing people make X, would increase amount X? sure follows.
I mean, argument would make sense iPhones, PlayStations, everything requires raw materials, is...(checks notes)...everything!

Actually intellectual property laws disagree premise.

Thankfully, allow generic versions many drugs, else would stuck thinking point valid. Yes, SF rim 70%! you’re saying American tax payer going buy 500m vaccines don’t want release patents. really profoundly great question.

Can explain Piggy Bank full money? empty. can't take hundreds dollars it? giving me?

That's Piggy Bank right? I'm absolutely outraged expect do! I'm certain Piggy Bank blame here, right? Start offering better incentives aka money chance win money. 

I rather people get vaccinated right reasons (for public health) get vaccinated wrong reasons (a chance win money) result still same.  Hmm, likely:

A. Covid-19 somehow developed Italy - country recent history origin outbreaks - unseasonal increase number respiratory illnesses Italy surrounding area winter, highly contagious virus *somehow* spread third way around world comparatively unknown Chinese city *without starting outbreak along way*, miraculously started spreading there.

B. Covid-19 developed China, area source recent disease outbreaks, spread locally, epidemic, pandemic. poor asymptomatic lab tech accidentally contaminated couple samples 2019 processing later on.

Decisions, decisions .... could religion. People get freaked whole stem cell testing basically damned pov. would explain Republican black demographics would culturally hesitant.  Context important. answering question whether would satisfied 70% vaccination rate, point want set target higher 80 even 90% ensure long lasting herd immunity variants, delta also new ones may come future. Ah yes, forgot citizens countries pay taxes US Yeah, don’t want donate anything. You’re thread country donating 500 fucking million fucking life saving coronavirus vaccines still criticize America. whole world treats us. donate billions upon billions defend myriad evils. pay money develop drugs. fund whole worlds disease research. bankroll fight climate change. Still, criticisms. Get vaccines China Russia dude. What’s France days? Maybe one donate five hundred fucking million fucking vaccines get shit media   think funds decides UN do? Martians?

Great question.

For UN I'm going guess administrative/bureaucratic body encompassing group united nations funded said nations, united global pact.

For I'm going guess administrative/bureaucratic body comprising members throughout world focused health funded nations world. whole world! Except basketball Mostly delta variant, well reopening.

Either people gonna die. one says needs lockdowns, except appropriate Another win places took zero Covid approach, distance long time. compare Pence Harris, latter way promote vaccine awareness. Pence, good idea but, urm, let's talk stuff. Cool keep paying turn Palestinian kids skeletons since consent taxed like this. Biondolillo said, ship made “technical call” — passengers don’t disembark — resumed regular schedule stop Sicily. Cruise ships slowly started service around world, still resumed United States since Centers Disease Control Prevention shut industry last March. Rubén Rodriguez, president MSC Cruises USA, said statement expects majority passengers vaccinated.  Unlimited money. Cool. Nope. wondering first person donate $1.50 be. don’t care enough act, talk. Yeah, lab incident cause mean crazy bullshit people think does.

The thing though, sort - precisely ""they"" think does.

I've always stated lab leak plausible theory, even go far say coin flip either way. also state really care scientific ""how prevent future"" sense.

Politically speaking different story.

I still thought anyone remote position power giving credence theory year ago utter peak irresponsibility though. Let's say CIA knows 100% lab leak fairly early on. that's case becomes public, would geopolitical situation everyone depends china recovery ill-informed citizenry crying blood. end result minimum full trade war millions dead, full blown escalation all-out shooting war.

In end can't really sanction go war country rely 100% recovery - information simply sit divest dependence. go public survive.

It interesting next year see goes, much ""decoupling"" (so far surface level best) industry total reliance China is. hourly rate NYC minimum wage. Yes. Biden could give 500 million extra IRS order start buying giving away vaccines.

Who think funds decides UN do? Martians? weren’t giving away 500MM vaccines Americans vaccinated. Let’s silly.

Actual article title: Hospitalizations could rise among unvaccinated U.S., health officials warn. 

The content article definitely favors article title thread title.

This worries me. longer spreads freely, larger number infected individuals, greater chance mutate way makes new problem. seems unlikely would change way renders current vaccinations ineffective, could happen. case, we're better world's people vaccinated. There's much global interaction concerned one's country.   It’s breakthroughs, it’s fact they’re vaccinating age groups, under-25s still aren’t eligible.

In fact lot things operating state lines likely gutted here. Someone please Photoshop shooting lasers people pointin' finger Meanwhile, Florida cruises required allow unvaccinated passengers onboard. . . think everyone able move pace. Like George Carlin said ""Somewhere worst doctor world, somebody appointment them, tomorrow.""

Guess found is.  Woo! Even excited visit soon!! Took long find comment good news without spike protein coronavirus can't spread easily. right vaccines hypothetically protect variants share spike antibodies for. Oh sure. Perhaps infection comment simplistic, exposure time, environment, viral load increase it.

As we've seen US, people supposed to, seeing masks amongst vaccinated masks amongst unvaccinated. obviously need mask inoculated sociological/ public policy issue. I’m Malaysia we’re still short lot vaccines. Due lack supplies even gov want buy them. yes Biden helps. saw too. Totally inappropriate use percentages. Floating Petri Dish spreads disease.

Are supposed surprised?

And remember Florida based cruise ships agreed require proof vaccination.  Love herd immunity magically starts 70%, almost Covid-19 paying attention.

But regardless good goal encourage people get immunized. I'd like send Caribbean Mexico, need they're also popular American vacation spots. need people going they're vaccinated accidentally getting unvaccinated people sick.  gave Astra Zeneca ones though….the one banned developed countries Feb 32nd leap day right? mend hold fallacy. called earlier argument stunk, backtracked - changed approach discussion redirected. comment nothing like earlier argument(s). ah ha! here.

Right wrong, I’ve drawn opinion want give away American taxpayer money appears altruistic world stage. still don’t think highly America rush point it’s flaws. maintain earlier argument even though you’ve changed point ad hominem.  FUCK MISS TOTAL ANNIHILATION

Exactly, pilots traced back fault.  like another source. :) variant Covid least partly responsible sparking fresh wave infection several countries, like India, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Fiji, Australia, etc. vaccines still efficacious Delta need vaccinate people much transmissible. Really? say that? usually like defending big corps, case Pfizer BioNTech two companies arguably impact ending pandemic much world. great deliveries supplied much world vaccine.

In end, prospect profits creates incentive perform well. great job rewarded it. full shit lol Hmm interesting. happen know comparable rates covid vaccines? argument something concern ""the risk *zero*!"" probably bad argument. Since when? convincing people take vax south border may difficult. Alzheimer's guy forgot pandemic ended Minnesota too. Pfizer vaccine needs refrigeration ? going useful poor nations? Seems like scheme enrich Pfizer ! That’s confuses anti vaxxers. sure COVID won’t give long term issues. got vaccine hope never get covid. Im young healthy adult. Covid dangerous me. I'd bet vaccine likelyhood safe, really stage idea long term effects could come road.

I'm choosing get due low risk even contract covid, far I've done good job avoiding basic shit like washing hands frequently touching face actually looked [that true.]( article also notes 1% people infected variant hospitalized. 1% (126 people), 83 entirely unvaccinated. 3 received doses.

This entirely non issue. Impressive self-awareness peice shit knuckle dragger. Seems like like admit then. like new Biden guys chosen. seems lot nicer guy.

Everytime call health service 'should soon', 'maybe next 2 weeks' etc.

We medically vulnerable person living us one dose far. want end.

I say frustrating watching America botch guidelines mask stuff Trump last year basically left house year see reopen financial clout buy vaccines need government scrapes thousand week businesses still shut Buy what? Debt. accidentally accounted anti vax population lol

Hopefully it’s way near 1 billion still idiots say move good enough pay attention games play avoid actions could made faster widespread vaccinations   like 1/15 1/16, we're closer 8 bil 7 bil Pretty solid start though.

So say “spend money cure cancer, don’t force rest us to”.

I don‘t know. might high? ignore vaccination case. nothing much (either good bad) currently COVID saying one instance overall data severity disease young children 12? 
     
CDC — Provisional COVID-19 Deaths Sex Age: Export tab CSV file (download). 
     
The recent CDC data death certificates US COVID-19 listed cause death sadly shows total 314 children US, age 1 year 17 years, died COVID-19 January 1, 2020, June 9, 2021, including 108 children age 5-14 years, 78 children 1 year age. 
       
Sadly, numbers reflect actual total number COVID-19 deaths ""of [lag death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS [National Center Health Statistics] processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more."" US never #1 per capita deaths. Many European countries ahead of, neck-and-neck with, slightly behind US. excuse badly? - future wave doesn’t mean don’t take flights live life now
- Vaccinated folks also lower chance severe COVID even catch it. Roughly chances getting seriously ill COVID vaccination getting seriously ill flu. assume shut flu season
- Lysol little COVID. Almost spread airborne little evidence transmission surfaces
- could help ease social events slowly adding vaccinated people life last phase usually occur worldwide mass vaccination. worst death toll world due denial sheer incompetence, stoking mass racism Asians pointing fingers crashing economy it. sure, let's give credit bare minimum end. businesses cannot freely choose business with. Canada caught fast, think they're fine National debt structured like bank account + credit card balance. lol **”Michigan ranks slowest recovery COVID-19 part highest COVID-19 hospitalization positive testing rates country**,” WalletHub analyst Jill Gonzalez said statement. “Michigan seen one biggest declines real [Gross Domestic Product] due pandemic, ranks seventh highest comes share hospitals reporting supply shortages one highest rates COVID-related doctor visits past week.” that? We've generally less COVID pretty much anywhere Hawaii. anyone seriously doubt president same? Pandemic ain't world it. Give tax refund fck stick 420th like rh fam  paper contains studies new evidence, read it, theory conjecture. Research Danish study. studied measured actual people masking found masks marginally useful. 1.8% compared 2% without, 0.2% less chance catching wearing mask correctly 2/3 hours day 30 days (you need wear correctly, many people don't). 0.2% 30 days less chance catching it, dying it, catching it. totally believe person make choice whether wear one, acting like they're saviour everything plain wrong. long they're private hospital. also vaccinate people come country haven’t gotten yet.  good news. Ugh. reason think T-cells wouldn't.  17 cents dollar. USD far CAD. Australia: she'll right mate, good origin? Honestly, greatest impact, probably South America, they're still struggling containing virus. developed countries managed get vaccinations started anywhere near many cases.  Yep bet got too. tf billionaires pay taxes? Ignorant it’s collective mass everyone classes world crippled disease bad business. likely saves US money long term able make meaningful difference global spread. Vaccinating whole world would worth cost IMO. IMF estimated cost Covid far $28,000,000,000,000. much US loose? 24% world economy. Also every country dealing Covid countries Africa dealing rest. fact Somalia failed state isn’t good reason avoid fighting Covid Kenya.  lol targeted recipients there. hadn’t seen that. 🎵America! Fuck yeah! Coming save motherfucking day yeah!🎵 serious? real world examples gonna meaningful clinical trial lol

also completely wrong clearly didnt even read link posted brazilian town sharing make make free everyone  also helps US. world crippled disease bad business.  Canadian could always cross land reason. (I’ve done times). amazing this, won’t quarantine anymore Per capita, US 18th world deaths 1,834 per million. 

Czechia, Belgium, Italy broke 2,000 deaths per million, UK 1,900. France, Spain, Portugal reporting 1,600+ deaths per million, hundred behind US. Europeans 1,000 deaths per million well.

But yes, US worst based total deaths.   vaccine mandatory, temperature checked constantly is?

That's beyond stupid. make thing actually help mandatory? Additionally, people vaccinated follow overly-strict rules. [I read wrong - it’s tons countries need this. Canada ok doesn’t say anything Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Haiti. 

This well needed done much much sooner. win goodwill. award dumbest comment entire thread goes to… u/extinction_six !!!! would nice know J&amp;J vaccine works Delta variant specifically, since that’s one gathering steam US. mention US trades extensively rest world covid major drain economies around world. beat Covid globally spur growth benefit US rest world economically. problem even though long, long time since hunter-gatherers, blink eye evolutionary time scale. Essentially genetically hunter-gatherer ancestors.

Preservatives useful tool keep food spoiling. make preservative healthy eat.

Added salt essential human body. primitive tribes Amazon jungle eat added salt even word it. Basically fossil remains ancient humans inland. So, added salt diets either. likely ancient humans lived coast seas use seawater flavour food. probably ability consume certain amount salt. composition table salt issue issue pure NaCl, whereas sea salt bunch minerals including K. going use salt food, make sea salt.

Added sugar - good, eat way ancient people, diabetes. need get fruit vegetables, already cultivated sweeter wild forms.

Grain foods - theory hunter-gatherers eat energy expended collect little grass seeds gain eating them. Grain foods rot teeth too. Skeletal remains farming societies show major tooth rot. eaten grain foods years now, cavities seen dentist since 2015.

Dairy - evolutionary ancestors definitely consume cow's milk. Cow's milk contains enzymes stuff promote growth pass immunity baby cows.

Legumes - bit controversial. Legumes poisonous eaten raw. theory primitive ancestors eat them. sometime eat cooked legumes restaurant.

The Paleo diet still evolving thing. basic premise eat foods evolutionary ancestors ate bodies likely adapted foods. entirely know foods are. lot based assumptions reasoning. certainly things ruled like modern preservatives, dairy table salt, added sugar grains too. think “bump“ possible wave? enough people without resistance happen now.

Your tax dollars pay roads, schools, cops, firefighters, libraries, healthcare. affront you? know tax dollars actually do? rates changing. still paying taxes. changes fucking nothing. much fractional amounts 500 million total world population? Sorry late reply. Yeah novel coronavirus still coronavirus. means already base knowledge virus turns ton gaps knowledge stress respiratory viruses like common cold.

Considering long dealing common cold, that's kinda insane. You’ve embarrassed here. vaccine, far know, ever long term side effects didn’t appear within days/weeks. vaccine broken passed body days get it… there’s reason believe would long term effects. That’s nice percent. American taxpayers buying Pfizer vaccine countries Probably he's coming ass. Pfizer Moderna US-based companies. Curious administration chosen favor one other. support companies vax tech efficacy rates similar.  smart pay taxes.  Even somehow managed substantial wave fall important realize situation serious disease death completely different now. Roughly 90% highest risk age ranges vaccinated would mean tremendous drop-off serious cases deaths. probably look lot like WA saw spring surges cases jumped up, deaths jump substantially.  understand anger US buying hundreds millions vaccines others. already underestimated number willing vaccinated bought excess numbers vaccines likely go waste. 

Who knows actually receive vaccines even used. 0head take you’d production facilities technology make mRNA vaccines first place order take advantage patent free vaccines. don’t would years even first plant would open depending country. understand 88% efficacy means? did, would worrying.  Juuuust edged [San competition fully support, way. Maybe done second dose skipped first. it’s going cost money I’d rather spend billions protecting world billions bombing it.

This right way forward. Yay taxes pay. doesn’t even benefit country.... allow pay massive debt since wont affect inflation much, besides ultra low rates now, better get debt later raise That's different issue. get there. matter much, proposed defense budget already greater previous years. Biden perfect, really like alot doing. That's gonna cost ton money. EU citizens Schengen citizens right cross border members reason all, restriction limits right. right guess call condition. true cases border may closed emergencies suspension rights limited time, 2 years call limited time. win hearts minds. best kind (shot the) arms race. Damn Canada really kicked gear. remember March everyone shitting them.   reason being, approximately equal pi. Hospitals constantly dealing really unhealthy people. We're talking people undergoing chemotherapy, emergency surgeries, etc. hospital one last places earth entertain idea letting people work without basic safety precautions. well, there's reason people use 22/7 approximate pi.

C'mon strings pulled plucked... think can. ""military justification"" anything since World War 2 Lmfao delusion. Quick question - today Pfizer “not profit” cost $10 two shots. works $5,000,000,000. funding coming ? 5B lot money. look US citizens first. spend vastly money US citizens day, every day, year year cost. bear mind pandemic won’t truly it’s everywhere it’s everyone’s interests richer countries help vaccinate poorer countries.   Agreed. Sorry read stuff. Really??? far news word mouth, 60 years old, frontliners, gov officials vaccinated. One ministers Khairy Jamaluddin personally ask know queue jumpers report him. I'm baby even dad usually got vaccine made sure both. Thankfully know anyone vaccinated, anti vaxxers seem like small loud minority here. employee ask day don’t understand question. First would care someone knows you’re vaccinated especially everyone required vaccinated. Second, concerned someone knowing, means keep wearing mask keep guessing. Third, assume HIPAA violation would disclosure PHI employer. Except employer isn’t telling anyone anything. People drawing conclusions based clues external environment. That’s thing employer disclosing PHI.

So, yeah, don’t understand question. get call Pfizer us. develoрed biontech. like saying Foxxcon iPhone 60% transmissible UK variant, already really transmissible Yeah everyone onboard vaccinated covid worry inevitable norovirus! I'm happy you. mom refuses get vaccine understand visit indoors/stay house. Would learn read saying shit like ?

Educate dumbass Yes, us taxpayers agreed buy 500 million doses Pfizer. First asked Larry, said yes asked John, also liked idea. good thing single taxpayer said no. 

You need specify US taxpayers money coming from, everyone knows. Thats many times primary way goverments recieve money. Biden administration made decision purschase 500 million doses donate course news articles going say that. US taxpayers buying doses vaccines (indirectly thats everything).  Nah, vaxx africa around 2/100 ppl gotten vaxxed there, dont want virus roaming maybe mutating something worse Pfizer/BioNTech still gives decent protection single dose, though.  No. mean supporting people. vaccines cost money know plenty people could use support.   good second dose problems PHE based “increased disease severity” hospitalization numbers variant. used metric B.1.1.7, claimed increased disease severity. Turned completely incorrect. vaccination date available many people Mexico :(  That's fine. met goals. know? ones kept increasing first one hit. 

I'm okay Stupid gunna stupid. news , water wet! Yep, specifically mentions purchased not-for-profit price intention donated covax use 92 lower income countries African Union.

I’m sure end donating large amount surplus doses bought use America too, think recently announced 80m coming from?  reading much costs locals host people little money actually stays there. really burden!

This MD fuggin' idiot, many different levels.  aren’t lockdown tho - borders closed. vaccinate soon enough barely experienced death prolonged lockdowns places endure. Don’t forget isolated communities wouldn’t worry much virus. alone probably 5% population mean, it’s fine far know. Related illnesses like SARS created complications years years getting sick within survivors. Coronavirus similar analysis electronic medical records California found 32% individuals long-term COVID-19 complications asymptomatic infections, experienced aftereffects months later. - unvaccinated, anywhere near them. majority world afford vaccines.

What may actually 3% would go lot farther may think. 

These vaccines aren’t going super isolated villages don’t need it, countries easily afford it, countries considered foreign enemies (like China Russia). leaves 1/3 1/4 world guess. Meaning that’s enough doses 9-12% world  Holden (and Australian manufacturing general) please resurrected competent Aussie government gets brought in? fully support (as Pfizer stockholder). person responding delusional stated restrictions forever another post. owns 21 trillion?

Lol petty, ever heard autocorrect mobile? Surely you’ve heard that. person responding living little fantasy world. may really believe country gonna lock mask permanently. Challenge: enter conversation USA's international policy without using China scapegoat.

USA China imperialist countries. criticize simultaneously “Nobody bothered”. Sure pal, sure. said “aren’t risk,” interpreted saying zero risk. different ideas value human life suppose. think greatly depends type people around. Sure transmission could low overall unvaccinated pockets people much likely. think sort intervention order here. Let vaccinated people good time. you’re vaccinated point, bad. Interesting, regardless vaccine make grandad magnetic dont fucking moron That’s bad Yeah agree, off-brand Chinese masks reassuring. certainly better reusable cloth paper mask regardless. legitimate vaccine injury compensated U.S. government Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, operates according standard rules compensation amounts including lost income. stores decide. mask mandate gone. CDC always trustworthy recommendations like “no masks needed!” last spring. Got it.  Restaurants essentially mask free.

Pretty logical reason that... God truth.  lol CDC says Women getting pregnant greatly impedes ability effectively certain jobs. employers right require get abortion? absolutely right. always eat healthy struggle that. train exercise though. see similar that.  immune system memory. better fighting things seen before. 

I doubt people great diets, healthy bodies powerful responsive immune system handle COVID.  

It analogous training.  might really really strong confident handle big thing future.  able handle big thing time comes. may even take body fewer days fight virus rapidly replicating state.  Maybe 5 days instead 10.  vaccine, maybe body exposed COVID fight 1 day. still 4 days body sloughing virus - even asymptomatic. training - ready deal quickly make whole lot sense consider common good. 

Avoiding training immune system handle virus pre-emptively choice making.  Fact is, others healthy, strong willed hosting strong responsive immune system.  virus makes immune systems stronger are.

If tying find magnetism, autism - found yet.  

If worried long term hazards, fair uncertainty. People AZ vaccine balanced risk blood clots risk negative impacts getting COVID. Risk COVID pretty high. 

Getting poke takes like 15 minutes strengthens immune system even more. reduces risk other.  devotion treating body well things needs, teaching pre-emptively deal nasty virus make sense? unless rocking N-95 day.

Why day? Can't grocery store somewhere else crowded limited time? I'm saying wrong I'm ignorant topic, I'm hard time understanding slowly mutating virus vs fast mutating one. said above, could time change render vaccine completely ineffective, sounds fast. Although year old, here's reputable article slowly mutates seems sum I've trying say, mutate slowly enough effective vaccine notable typically mutate slowly many viruses. Influenza, example, mutates quickly, people must inoculated annually changing flu strains.  low mutation rate virus means possible generate successful vaccine,""

I found one particularly virus replicates—makes copies genome within cell—it uses enzyme called polymerase. viruses accurate versions these, others, HIV influenza, not, Thielen says. ""Coronavirus polymerases something call 'proofreading activity,' exactly like sounds,"" says. ""Once genome replicated, enzyme identify mistakes made correct them. Sometimes still gets things wrong, however, small changes occur.""

I know much article outdated I'm assuming quotes not, may wrong. Instead Fauci suggested people wear two masks, harm good imo bc sounded like making rules went along.

I dunno good stock unvalved N95s though, Home Depot 3M ones since beginning pandemic. I'm sure brands fine 3M probably one many people trust.  double infectious double likely send hospital vaccinated. might disease much deadlier. fingers crossed you!

Didn’t say zero risk, looking CDC’s slides meeting though it’s pretty darn close statistically. wouldn’t safe? asking might get second dose Pfizer first AstraZeneca. thing got weird bruise hand AZ don’t know would riskier me. think necessarily pushing theory. Scientific investigations conducted Bayesian framework - priori probability given historically prevalent side (in case, natural origin), evidence comes in, probability gets adjusted base theory alternative. far evidences regarding lab leak/creation show virus could come lab, add possibility alternative theories. First all, evidences regarding lab theories circumstantial, kind evidence hard come natural origin, document much animal activities own. Weighing much circumstantial evidences leads confirmation bias. Secondly, evidences regarding virus gain function agreed upon scientific community yet, lot evidences show could modified lab, likely modified lab. Showing suspect capable commiting crime lead conclusion likely did. It’s zero risk young kids, it’s certainly lower adults even U.S. pharmaceutical firms Pfizer Moderna predicted data showing whether coronavirus vaccines effective younger children available fall. Many families eagerly awaiting vaccine authorization kids. hesitancy could worse among families deciding vaccines young children, young children lower risk severe covid-19 older adults even adolescents one underway good opportunity? really is. Found non smoker. got Moderna vaccine specifically higher dose would make magnetic. IIRC, 1 dose Pfizer enough considered adequate protection B.1.351, much like 617 variants. 53-100% (77% estimate) 2 doses Pfizer. single dose Pfizer, according Qatar real world study, 58% B.1.351 B.1.1.7. But, know B.1.1.7 little immune escape, means single Pfizer dose lower 58% B.1.351. even gave extreme benefit doubt gave 1 shot Pfizer 58% B.1.351, J&amp;J still outperforms 64%. say B.1.351 worse confidence though. every vaccine showcases immune escape. greatest antibody-fold reduction. shit ton listed comorbidities ARDS Pneumonia basically things Covid causes kill you.

America needs stop shitting janitors would magnetic even bad? Would cool stick fridge magnets accessories. fly Ohio like 1-2x year. Place wild lolz Everyone get it. still millions people within 15 miles still haven’t gotten it, despite fact get pharmacy, hospital, doctor’s office, mass vaccine sites, pop vaccine sites, etc. single person NYC 30 minutes away vaccine bus/subway. Hell, believe services come residence get vaccine. 

Access arguably issue three months ago. anymore. difference spending $1.5 $15 trying stop vaccine resistant variant effectively zero. either case we're talking less day work. new variant causes miss even two hours work lost cash buying vaccines.

Buying vaccines 3rd world countries literally best possible investment country make right now.  Nature well respected scientific journal. affects us one that? Lancet one mean. one know paper hydroxychloroquine, origins covid. wasn’t intent obfuscate, led change editorial policies hopefully end situation again. Nature wrong? interviewer asked question poorly. trying ask

If place blindfold person try press two non-magnetic bars other, place rubber ball two rods perceive resistance. replace bars genuine bar magnets size weight. perceive resistance even rubber ball present. 

It noticeable blindfolded able differentiate actual rubber ball feeling pair magnets produces. 

That puzzles me. explain that? switching bars non-magnetic ones actual magnets produce convincing feeling solidity? happening explains experience? 

And instead went tangent - get crux people feel/perceive press bar magnets together - actual physical object present holding apart hands.   Kinda like movie home! boov arrived! Meanwhile state barely 40% adults vaccine demand dropped 98% 😩 opinions anything.

Okay. literally think herd immunity would sufficient stop new variants overpowering vaccine. That's opinion. zero opinions making comments it. opinion obviously wrong since existing variants already reinfecting think it’s shameful Biden interject debate.

Yeah! dare Joe Biden, president United States America, interject debate global spending coronavirus vaccination investing US taxes 3rd world vaccination efforts. shameful ""protect Americans possibility vaccine resistant variant COVID-19"".

Your objection seems language. ""Biden spends"". language works. every president every leader every country. one ever says ""taxpayers spending x dollars new infrastructure program"". honestly think reads headline thinks ""Wow, generous Joe Biden buy 500 million vaccines personal money! nice guy!"". might you. gave goosebumps reading Packed awesome info. Thanks! Updated. low population density make logistics things like difficult? example I'd imagine need vaccination sites per capita ensure easily accessible. may change Delta/India variant. Evidence suggesting risk younger people. Future mutations change significantly, well Hmm, interesting. I've never spent much time part country, thanks info. Didn’t recent Cleveland Clinic study basically agree? Yup Hmmmm next they'll try balance tricks people. 

and makes magnetic, i'm seeing downside here. state rural state definitions One vaccine one several-hundred-thousand chance possibly causing dangerous side effect. (Which treatable know watch it.) you’re uncomfortable that, two *no* adverse effects recorded beyond minor soreness, fever, tiredness. safety monitoring sensitive caught J&amp;J safety signal *six people 7 million* problem, paused that. serious safety signals, would see now. *cries Georgian* thats good question CDC says irrelevant post Covid cases United Kingdom. Yeah evidence paid someone take basic science exams. would think athletes coaches would scrambling vaccination. lifetime most.and would want even mildly k want top shape? point? saw question feigned ignorance media negative US past four years. Yeah, wondering that. I‘m US, considering early vaccination campaign began many vaccine doses available, thought lack access thing anymore US. assumed everyone wanted vaccine, could gotten one now. incorrect? I’m aware of. 

There’s circumstantial evidence accidental leak lab studying naturally occurring virus. evidence mainly coincidental proximity lab first known case newer evidence possible cover regarding possible origin lab. circumstantial. course evidence thst originated wet market less circumstantial. remember correctly also second “patient zero” another wet market. 

The evidence created lab, like gain function research instance, maybe engineered that, seems highly adapted humans. That’s pretty speculative.

That’s understand least Well fit goal 70% vaccination July 4? Well, least I've learned something great today. Thank you.  good enough.

Lift patents, let world manufacture vaccines actually vaccinate people deadline laid scientists.

I thought Biden Mr. ""Listen Science Man"" yet ignoring scientists office. Probably adults know government things tax payers dollars. That's kind government works. minimum wage fucked tied inflation Well, anything could happen. worst possible long-term effect aliens land planet embark drone extermination campaign vaccinated reasons cannot comprehend. that's extremely unlikely.

We good circumstantial evidence nothing happen: vaccine leaves nothing body, vaccine ever long-term effects started two months vaccination, countless doses administered, expect someone whatever theoretical syndrome happen even though people would happen years now. seen all; effects we've seen acute things like blood clots heart inflammation (which course extremely rare).

And can't consider theoretical risks vaccine: risks infection real, even young healthy, include death, also long painful recovery lung damage never quite get way back from, sucks too. one hand small real serious risk, risk probably exist all, even certainly far smaller first one. keep going back original argument OP takes one mutation render ineffective. That’s I’m talking about. takes steps. They’re tracking mutations they’re getting farther away vaccine. That’s one mutation. That’s many. original comment I’m arguing makes sound like sudden one mutation could pop tomorrow that’s sudden different mutated escapes completely. least that’s took mean. everything I’ve read, appears won’t mutation happens overnight series many mutations eventually “render ineffective.” whole point that’s true, won’t sneak us suddenly. They’ll see evolving effectiveness lower slowly, exactly we’re seeing.

The part quoted false far know. situation similar Europe, four covid-19 vaccines granted “conditional marketing authorisations,” fast track mechanism used emergencies. converted standard “marketing authorisations” pending positive data authorisation, yet happened covid-19 vaccine administered.

Source: antibodies provide degree immunity, especially variants. vaccine still way effective. state (Vermont) hit 80% we're 100K smaller Seattle, lol.   consider weight single mask gown, still lot. vaccinated masks required. Australians dumb af sadly I'm Australian  Potentially. people become vaccinated generate immunity infection harder become virus spread. Also participants ask drop-out study time CureVac said problem approved vaccines becoming increasingly available participants drop-out get approved vaccine. Last year ""problems"" exist. They’re endangering everyone.

Every time virus copies there’s chance mistake. millions copies every infected person mistakes eventually result mutation works. longer covid around spreading likely one mutations results something vaccines don’t work on.

And happens we’re back square one. it’s safe it’s ever going you.

Haha thanks. Also interpreted meaning Definitely invite grandma club bullshit legitimate scientific research. Sorry burst sunshine dream bubble harsh reality disregarding warnings got point.

I think book better movie Avatar. slap baby powder arm let know still ""magnetic""...   That's viral mutation works. COVID mutating billions times day globally. tracking small number billions mutations notable: infected many people, different behaviors strains. billions mutations per day... almost them, produce strain broken: cannot thrive. mutations produce variant pretty much exactly strain mutated from: different enough note. mutations produce strain different makeup behavior... small ways potentially large ways. 


There's no, absolutely way predict emerge third group. could version virus far less deadly, far transmittable spike pattern generates good immune response: kind mutation could effectively end pandemic occurs spreads. likewise possible unknown likely that, said, variant could discovered tomorrow 0% reactivity vaccines currently high R factor. would trigger second pandemic, effectively. would inaccurate assert confidence kinds mutations occur can't happen time. 


This understanding issues, course.  really new news, scientists saying beginning likely COVID-19 becomes 5th endemic strain Coronavirus circulates population. good news ""gone through"" world once, everyone level immunity either vaccine infection - even 100% good enough subsequent infection slightly different variants causes minor symptoms. pretty much ""novel"" viruses work - explode scene cause lot initial harm, ""fade"" background normal seasonal illness.

You’re making fool yourself, don’t know you’re talking great countries wait country fully vaccinated sharing rest world. First one, other. known 100%, precise number available yet science still it. There's studies coming 90s initially, longer term known antibodies drop.

At young age infants rely mothers antibodies. stops, they’re adaptative immune systems (like humoral immune system), produces repertoire immature B cells undergo clonal expansion exposed pathogen B cell receptor recognizes. expansion process take you’re first exposed novel pathogen. Overtime, selection occurs B plasma cells produce antibodies greater avidity (binding tightness epitope).

If don’t get exposed pathogens, many common childhood illnesses contracted later on, you’re immune system hasn’t time refine response (like selecting greater avidity). result common childhood infections, may even produce symptoms, contracted much severe cause serious complications.

Like even scaled delivery estimate Germany 10M doses Q2. 3 weeks end quarter less 2 Million doses delivered. would extremely surprised whe even hit half estimate - makes less J&amp;J half year Pfitzer/Biontech delivers per week. Tough shit. That’s access, that’s prioritizing getting vaccine. I’m running sympathy this. one doesn’t 30 minutes (out 6720 waking minutes every week) get vaccine. Get one running errands. Take hypothetical kids taking care CVS. Get one lunch. It’s 8 weeks since vaccine universally available adults, STILL don’t time get it? 

People still parents deathly sick unexpectedly. Even get vaccine side effects, still parent. 

I hate sound harsh, excuses fucking insulting work federal, state, local governments done help people get vaccines. volunteers going around poor neighborhoods opening vaccine clinics. many resources, yet everyone keep bitching “access” hypothetical single parents take care 4 kids working 8 jobs. totally scientific observation everyone know slightly harder time one two shots, one varied. wonder first shot sufferers Covid didn’t know it. second one me. really, really tired. Ooooohhhh let hear! find non-paywall article NBC, thing annoyed line ""Some experts believe larger reason many patients seek treatment feared becoming infected virus."" 

Hey. No. That's whole story. 

Last spring/summer, hospitals clinics cancelled everything elective, prior that, impression ""elective"" meant ""boob jobs,""'but means ""Well, dying exact moment.""

I family member chronic condition whose appointments, diagnostic tests routine preventative care cancelled. condition worsened (and like, could seen coming?), ended needing major surgery.

It also super hard get treatment certain conditions symptoms also covid list. 

In area, one hospital/clinic group determined facilities Covid Covid. Primary care generally classified Covid, meant ""covid symptoms,"" even allowed building primary care doctor practiced. yeeted directly Covid facility seen urgent care. 

On one hand, completely makes sense, since headache symptom high blood pressure, meant patient documented history high blood pressure whose BP experiencing headaches would kicked urgent care Covid testing instead seen primary care doctor equipped manage high blood pressure. 

Something similar happened spouse. flare well documented chronic condition *one* symptom matched covid list. see primary care provider person enter building, tried set video visit. Nope. *one* matching system, barred video visits Covid facility cleared them. 

This resulted following delightful exchange: 

Dr: ""Your covid result negative.""
Spouse: ""Yeah, figured."" 
Dr: ""This appears flare chronic condition."" 
Spouse: ""Yeah, figured.""
Dr. ""...Oh. Well, give week's worth meds, urgent care really best option dealing this. see primary care?""
Spouse: ""They let door sent here. one covid symptom."" 
Dr: ""Oh. Well, that's...huh.""
Spouse: ""Yeah.""

So, again, understand system set like that. logical aspects, feel like there's going flood worsening untreated chronic conditions and/or new late diagnoses hospitals get back normal.

You give third world country place virus thriving. Canada, vaccination goes pretty well since point vaccine minimise death/end pandemic, giving vulnerable people people living hotspot higher priority vaccinating whole country first. Alt data saying hospitalised individuals jabs. Also delta variant spiking areas vaccine uptake low. UK pushing vaccines aggressively we'd lot trouble right now... cases reasonably suggesting vaccine causing deaths? 

No.

Not reasonable  you, owner private business, required keep someone staff danger customers staff member lives free country?  Good news everyone! Vaccines perfect. example, [AstraZeneca 60% effective Indian  already hear conservative coworkers complaining.

Those people vaccinated wearing masks anyways....why I, taken seriously fully vaccinated, continuing mask?

In area, majority fully vaccinated...me wearing mask around vaccinated people move needle spread much spread already low.

In area self-preservation protection community, security theater. 

And always variants, area essentially asking preventative masking threat may may come...again masking mitigation prevention...we wear masks every single virus threat covid area roughly flu due vaccination...so need low.

I see point. live Ohio…. Send help Money printer go brrrrrr kind researcher? Clearly relevant one understand study mechanisms thrombosis relevant whether variant could cause increased thrombosis.

Where evidence variant conclusively causing increased hospitalizations, increased inflammation, increased micro thromboses? even read article? clearly political hit piece.

They ""importing"" vaccine Korea India, licensed production. essentially outsourced scale imports impossible Russia received two cargo planes loaded Sputnik V South Korean manufacturer, GL Rapha, December company expects send another shipment coming days.

So technically is, course, ""importing"", getting something country probably goes import process, like anything else.

But would say Apple ""importing"" iPhones China sell US?   Ask doctor get shot ask medical team, imagine fine calmer knew beforehand. Tax payers bought 500 million doses. Let's get straight. Haha nah  goes Reddit replying wrong comment. Sorry bother you! agree. neighbors receive first.
A couple reasons:
1. majority North America vaccinated it’s good us, them.
2. Americans live Mexico country besides U.S. travel back forth vaccinated.
3. It’s responsibility take care neighbors. old headline 2020? would never know masked people grocery store. fully vaccinated going store maskless well business allows vaccinated people wear mask. grocery store, one people maskless. spend hour count one hand many weren’t wearing mask. also people still wearing masks outside driving alone mask on. may highest vaccinated major city, also probably one top cities still back normal far stuck 2020. vaccine gets full approval, mandatory like vaccine get go school.

I also clarify, doesn’t mean infant age 1 playing sand pit, would probably advise that. child age 1, less, benefits innate passive exposure microbes. Also one highest rates higher education.

Yeah, I’m frustrated lack information it. It’s like everyone dismissed outright risk blood clots made public. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏼🤦🏻‍♀️ suppose pets would helpful (if possible). erring extreme side caution puzzling me. Like could quantitatively assess risk near zero, yet still push extreme measures. start wonder data-driven decisions simply emotional Cruises today super cheap. complimentary burial sea amenity hard pass up. happens lot it’s stressful. “Do say do” real, even though unconvincing. vaccination highly contagious disease another matter. 9% actually better 70% partially vaccinated 10% fully still rising 52/42 completely stuck there... matter? Vaccines getting spread. self-centered americans paying it? It’s bettering world process.  3 classes actual Science classes, applied science, different. Applied science ton memorization, teach scientific thought critical thinking.

Thanks playing. trump evil man history! would tweeted something mean Sure concerns me, feel though American people subsidize purchase vaccinations countries.  like waiting Super Bowl surge, Valentines Day surge, St. Patrick’s day surge, Easter surge, Opening Day Rangers park surge, countless others. 

It’s odd get kicks hoping covid surges. speaks volumes. idea Trump would done that. Trump good job expediting vaccine. well might done are. private non-profit. aware vaccine hesitancy high Russia. another reason [Russia exporting vaccines produced home importing doses people's Presumably, country exporting, would import (or would import less). SIL going hell that.  underestimate critical thinking skills medical staff. every really smart Doctor, Nurse, Tech, there's one dumb. Privately owned corporations gotta make money somehow. general agree, world better ever was, US big part that. However, lot people grown hating US frequent military actions (bombings, drones, etc.). Dismissing 'atrocities there,' even military justification, help that.

Giving away vaccines world though, can't fault that.  Yeah it’s actually exact opposite. Nice try though. Naw. ADN-BSN course things like Research, Community Health Management.

ADN Nurses learn anatomy/physiology, microbiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology. really lovely thing appropriate circumstances but, would even better companies finally patent waivers. way vaccines could made everywhere everyone shipping would far less problem. would end pandemic much faster. Title reporting study found. Yeah I'm disputing US donating vaccines. Moderna since start said enforce patents pandemic. many manufacturers utilized multiple countries companies asking permission right now, I'm sure would say them.

Please state source saying allowing people make X, would increase amount X? sure follows. mean, argument would make sense iPhones, PlayStations, everything requires raw materials, is...(checks notes)...everything!

Actually much going electronics currently. also suffer shortage raw materials (semiconductors). That's hard get hands new GPU Playstation. allowing companies make GPUs help, lack semiconductors would still limit manufacturies.

Sure, raw material shortage *eventually* get fixed vaccines electronics. problem takes long doses needed now, allowing companies fight limited resources nothing immediate issues.

Not mention time takes set facilities. Even huge resources took experienced companies almost year set manufactory capacity today.

---

This pandemic special time important. Allowing companies produce vaccines would eventually lead doses, time likely shortage vaccines more. Therefore better focus pressing issues.

And patent waiver goes companies get profit vaccines paid design test, would hurt incentive develop vaccines future pandemics. spending money buy themselves? know Pfizer is, I’m looking info J&amp;J vaccine Delta variant wrt immune escape need too. Follow government website see we're getting per capita much second doses (especially Moderna) may needed but, YES MEXICO needs too! course going happen. There's many reasons avoid going cruise, COVID one more. spouse also got JJ seems less information it.

He terrified new strains might mutate something deadly much severe side effects one time resources study taking care of. Lol, haven’t done much medical research you?

Do realize determining lack increase disease severity extremely important? baby nature paper simply found increase mortality. used basis speculating variant could cause severe illness. 

What Lancet paper specifically refute that, find *no*, hospitalized sick before. take little moment realize hospital cohort becoming ill (at all!), cohort would experience mortality, in-fact increase diseases severity mortality. such, need search reasons Nature article found (spoilers, things like access care make big difference). lancet paper robustly spells out. 

You know know relevant? lancets papers (and couple others) PHE stop considering B.1.1.7 play

I also think unlikely impose restrictions again, matter bad gets, due nature politics.

I wonder effects JUCO tournament be, though mostly outside. Country Jam coming up. think policy makers believe this, need published threshold trigger lifting restrictions. basic bureaucratic CYA. Dude, would love magnetic. Yup.

And don’t see DoD sending docs nurses again. deployed thousands doctors nurses risk hospitals 2020, vaccine place there’s really reason service members deploy again, saving lives complete violation personal choice. New Hampshire would rather die. maybe lube? would rather trust immune system.

Vaccines create effective immune responses never let down. call anti Vax. I'm not. mumps. measles. TB.

If immune system let down, drawn conclusion somehow indicates invulnerability viral illness, received get flu shot. guess what. get flu.

This silly argument. lit house fire, therefore need smoke plan getting it.

You even need plan! (or soon able to) walk pharmacy weekly shopping plan getting vaccine that's kinda pointless age demographic life style choices.

I truly believe US military get right LOT often get wrong. bump 5% cases lead restrictions see increase hospitalizations drastic increase cases places might impose new restrictions. full lockdown, shocked see indoor mask mandates, maybe capacity restrictions closing large venues well. 

Of course option go low vaccinated states may never impose restrictions would hit hard another wave. Ohhhhhhhh, dumbass! Got it.

Lottery yes, individual rewards like joints no. someone received shot months ago can't walk in, show card get joint.  small relative lottery? Yes, humans notice inequalities distribution resources act accordingly.   keep reminding that, starting phase life pandemic puts extra layer anxiety everything. Especially since we’re Texas pandemic magically disappeared. who’s money? Hmm wonder complicated either said.

Nah can't imagine anyone saying anything dumber topic. moment shipment arrives, useless PM claim credit, like Australian Federal Police succeeded encrypted app sting operation, he's front press like coded app himself. bush fire action contain COVID19 needs done, he's nowhere sight. Sorry Trump years good world. global ripple effects like helping Bolsonaro get elected Brazil gonna horrible long term global consequences. yeah, it’s nice see US good guys again. dingdong asked silly question. Unless Jeff bezos. like $0.14 /yr. things paid state local taxes  much best interest keep variant vaccines ineffective arising. percentage many think are? think five people work know won’t get it. think see big slow around 80%. record, double vaxxed.  embarrassment doctor is. This. good diplomacy, reduces variants might make current vaccines useless. houses neighborhood fire, makes sense help put lest spread house. 


And course, right thing do. Excuse . . . United States taxpayers buying these. Credit credit due! literally trusted people though? Surely person would done something now! Maybe social distanced then, especially age group virtually unaffected covid. Clearly didn’t read original comment responded to

Nothing variant would cause physiologically distinct response like increased clotting, full stop. Proud American here. Australia can't get vaccine shit order.

We however helping healthcare iirc prepared lot back February last year, thankfully need use it.  Given way Covid19 propagates almost sure present Georgia state Georgia country. get back normal, might worth it. Sure. also possible variant could cause increased clotting circulation problems somehow. valid determine whether ""nothing new"" something new. article calling research hypothesis - cornerstone science. fabricating quotes instead finding relevant evidence. I’d say ensuring variant doesn’t pop vaccines useless definitely beneficial. high vacination areas would expect see 5 % bump all. Maybe crazy varent shows f'd situation anyway.   sarcastic? Yes agree, world leader much highest military budget ironic thing studies saying getting covid might cause infertility. Granted might short term. reassuring, thank lemme get straight: wanna matchmake unvaccinated workers unvaccinated recipients services? Work home. Seriously, there's program gives like 10k tax write-offs moving expenses move Vermont remote job. don’t want live planet anymore. sitting CA feeling bad 58% least 1 dose, looking stats glad live state south. Amazing go states accurately predict ones lower vaccination rates. You’re lucky. Millions died virus, casualties vaccine incredibly (though you’ll feel little sick day, fades within 48 hours). really. explicitly acknowledging Type 1 diabetes contributing factor, (obviously doctor) death certificates list series contributing factors.

This mean contributing factors root causes.

It's great analogy terrible arguments COVID deniers. Living fine diabetes dying COVID equivalent fatal car crash infected COVID, recorded either. make someone magnetic women? Asking friend.

It's insanity.  world isn’t better US, *your* “world” better, say US better. kinda obvious, bad guys live well take advantage others. 

“Sure find atrocities there”

Cringe, really waving away atrocities? “But long don’t happen me, cares right?” 12-15 cohort likely largest. also know docs advising getting vaxxed pregnant. majority - exactly sliver. Current cases skewing toward younger patients.

Parents children 12 also pickle. Kids petri dishes human form.

My main concern CDC's timing this. California, *no one* 12-15 time get fully vaxxed - since become eligible, chance get first one. get COVID - also spread it.

I get trying - stirred pre-muddied waters process. Better, perhaps, suggested delay full implementation (which California did), caseload benchmark states could use guide, allow better vaccine coverage. Um, parents unvaccinated kids like me? People sweaty skin, press almost high surface area low weight item several seconds item stick while. lol everyone use silver coins. ""feel like happening?"" Right? like... yeah, people also ""survived"" atomic bombs dropped Hiroshima Nagasaki. People survive lots terrible things.

People refusing vaccine religion. It’s way tougher crack politics. mild hospitalized 81% people side effect? reading comprehension good morning. would rather trust immune system. never let down. call anti Vax. I'm not. mumps. measles. TB. get flu shot. guess what. get flu. gotten covid. plan getting it. Also plan getting vaccine that's kinda pointless age demographic life style choices. comorbidities unhealthy definitely get it. villify people want it. Shitty take knew people lax here, really think bad. Guess stuck Austin bubble think least 60% first shots point really cares? want take precautions get vaccinated let achieve immunity old fashioned way. choice, seem made minds. really get right wing talking point long time covid overblown nearly big deal treated. case....who cares Chinese lab studying weak, apparently mostly harmless virus? like mental gymnastics thank god Trump getting us vaccines, refuse take it. saying Trump rushed dangerous, untested vaccines? also think probably bad idea tell people ""Just get one shot... even worry 2nd... still lot protection would shot all."" obsession two shots children 12 vaccinated we're stopping short 70% many areas (well short some), boggles mind. 

I can't really understand secondary campaign leftovers get one dose least. know people heard many horror stories 2nd dose (...I know...), that's excuse. I'm line vaccine, know anyone got really sick corona, know got sick vaccine lol

Still going get it, I'm bit nervous tbh

I've stayed away searching vaccines end sites talk 5G, lizard people Bill Gates injecting nano robots

Fully agree you. apparently sub dominated Covid-denying twats. Laughs 6 years. It’s decades post graduate school, fellowships, research, work experience, etc went clubbing vegas 2 nights memorial day weekend. fully vaccinated. almost 2 weeks later I'm fine. Nope, idea. Like said, I’m pro vaccine. feel like haven’t heard much people dying feel like it’s happening, people attacking asking well-meaning questions helping able better address vaccine fears people encounter.

It’s frustrating can’t honest discussions stuff it’s impossible disentangle politics. stinks. hope get anyone else sick irresponsibility.   duration immunity yet known tracked: original clinical trial patients show signs protection fading plan quickly spin booster shots, could third dose could something targeted new dominant variants. Hopefully immunity lasts long time, still possible does. concern vaccine immunity fades uptake booster would much lower original. Ben Jerry’s Sunday NJ- masks required really, nations crisis, developed here, made sense stabilize nation start spreading resources thinner. way knew production means transportation would risk failing try help others. like plane oxygen masks drop, always say put first help others without passing yourself, potentially person tried help survive instead potentially neither.

Yeah, think people underestimate eating clean (avoiding preservatives, processed food) consuming fruits veggies effective. cutting things like soda, cookies, chips (my weakness) willpower goes long way. That's people saying. whole planet quickly halted vaccine administration sign rare adverse effect (the blood clots AZ J&amp;J). quickly people argue (or least time) proactive. would suggest hyper vigilance associated vaccines general background vaccine hesitancy opposite say true. evidence fast, heavy-handed reactions governments blood clot data (which rare required lots data collection monitoring even notice). 

You said, essence, ""a person know died cause know, vaccinated recently, could vaccines?"" post above, ""I know person (except healthy apparently) if...."". inviting discussion built guesses assumptions. even know vaccine mailman's friend received? Absolutely. point, close billion people worldwide, 100M US alone, gotten vaccines, whole incredibly safe. 

It's also extremely rare, maybe never case, vaccines major long-term side effects clear result short term side effects. makes sense - vaccine harm weeks following getting it, would harm years later?

Reply confirm confirmation unsubscription BidenFacts. **Update Swedish vaccination numbers.**

49.4% adults (18+) received least one shot, 24.3% adults fully vaccinated. terms full population (Sweden 10.40m inhabitants), percentages approx. 38.9% first shots 19.2% full vaccinations. total 6 037 543 doses administered, i.e. 58 per 100 pop.

Currently (new) vaccinations made either Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna. AstraZeneca reserved 65+ age group pretty much finished vaccinations save second doses. J&amp;J paused indefinitely likely never used. Excess doses AFAIK donated COVAX.

Most Sweden's 21 regions currently vaccinating around ages 40+ 50+, together 18+ comorbities medical staff. nationwide age distribution currently

Age | First dose coverage | Full vaccination
---|---|----
18-29 | 10.51% | 4.73%

40-49 | 29.02% | 7.64%

The national goal adults offered first dose Sep 5. past 7 days total 637 107 doses administered, average 91 015 per day. Adjusted US population corresponds 2.9m doses/day. vaccinations recently seem 2nd doses rather 1st doses.

Around 600k doses Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna currently delivered weekly. bit 16m doses required fully vaccinate adults, i.e. around 10m additional doses needed that.

Canada vaccine lotteries too: equally rude Canadians Americans. Stop nationalist stop trying distance neighbors. Canada depends heavily US many ways, there’s way getting around that. characterizations Americans flat wrong. many people America pigeon hole one type. Open eyes Canadian patriotism. 

Notice states lifting restrictions case counts continue go down. vaccines work. Period. Play video games lol it’s day off. got going back guess  Idiots people refusing vaccine lied tricked social media disinformation campaigns depressing. 

That people help variants continue spread (like young children ) truly protected yet tragedy. effectively transferring risks populations protect themselves. detect much science here, sense bunch ""well maybe know..."" summarizing scientific concepts incorrectly cherry-picking statistics. example, mentions ""DNA amplification"" PCR testing. theory he's right that's PCR tests work, covid-19 RNA virus. That's significant fact, way, means they're capable horizontal gene transfer allows mutations spread viral cells quickly.

Aren’t people vaccinated going risk certain time also? unvaccinated that’s risk?
