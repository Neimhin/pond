Good luck Since COVID killed lot elderly, especially pre existing conditions, expect deaths per year drop lot next years? sound lot like husband. sports loves music: specifically good jazz rock. NYC, might people making comments didn’t wear mask. here’s another reason wear mask: people either nervous charge enforcing mask rules don’t need worry me. wear mask, that’s one less person stop evaluate.

I’m happy us get point don’t need wear them. isn’t single person thinks wear forever ever. many parts world, community whole there. approach pandemic community mindset. individual one. doesn’t matter personal status is; follow conservative recommendations it’s clear needed anymore. feel need demand special exceptions me, matter actual infection risks Well, look population countries Germany India vaccinate actually pace. me.

2) byeee lot older high risk people can't fully isolate need caregivers. I'm high risk disabled person I've workers coming home 4 days week whole mess. lot governors doing, 
reopening essential workers vaccinated yet also ethically problematic.

Like said, decades decades ethical debates incoming, everything vaccine rollout lockdowns. That's makes ethics complicated, answers rarely straightforward. people Reddit say we’re basically third world country!

Lmfao sub r/worldnews essentially calling Americans ignorant subhuman fucks year long. I'm acting like twat acting like twat. shocker! want nice? nice, then. kind someone who's rudely dismissive people's concerns?

The Golden rule apply you, good sir. Hope realize next time get fight strangers online hostile, provide links shilling recent posts.

Thank giving clear information. husband introvert extremely well pandemic. daughter moderately introverted, could tell issues I'd take drives walks whenever noticed going stir crazy. 

I like get things, staying home really, really hard. daughter, developing online friendships really helped, me, keeping busy artistic endeavors helped. man, would love worry wearing mask. think whole idea vaccination passports US necessary. get point low transmissibility due herd protection, would matter much particular individual vaccinated. exceptions may medical facilities elderly care. Usually learning job happens mentorship willingness research work problem own. grasp basic concepts leave, company taking junior knows need mentorship seniors.

It took 3 1/2 years get 100k, company pays 75 percentile. first company paid 35k first year, take get knowing years linkedin blowing make lost cash. get far develop passion it. first years exhausting using brain much uses lot energy! stop dreaming code! people end really enjoying don’t excel get promoted quickly. 

After hit around three years highly suggest levelling taking Comp Science classes. took career next level. don’t mind either. Now, confess, seldom go many places. long. spent 30 minutes grocery store, hour. spent 20 minutes drugstore. go mother-in-law‘s wear mask whole time I’m there. wear mask go apartment building basement. wear mask go hour long walk. Especially since live New York City sidewalks crowded. Otherwise, I’m home. wear mask hour; it’s hard. get vaccine, can't get spread it... fine? Right? get updated shots stuff like MMR pertussis serology reports proving immune going (a different) grad school, I'm really surprised   went Cornell, ya ever heard it? graduated 4 years, never studied once, vaccinated whole time, and... sang cappella group Comes Treble.  one upset wanting things open. actually agree fully would hope colleges open fall. assuming agree tone, agree message. 

That's another lesson you: act like twat, even valid argument dismissed people otherwise agree you. actually basically agree pretty much everything saying, seem prat. China...I don’t know numbers first place. far Vietnam goes idea honest feel confident science, feel sure we’re putting people risk, we’ll cheerfully stop wearing masks. say NZ country contained it. loud-ass coworkers yelling across cube farm

I lol'd line, thanks chuckle. 

We even cubes, lines desks. Working home done wonders productivity. aren’t views. views guy built project. There’s enough people hitting sources online won’t get appointment aggregator. get one source dropped, you’ll late. 

This doesn’t mean supply accounted though. millennials suck online supply generally unaware local pharmacies, get convenient nearby appointments you’re willing make calls. 

In terms, meta changed. site used OP, it’s nerfed new eligibility rules. new meta going pharmacy chain websites time appointments drop, calling local pharmacies. Canada *and world*  Still fucking eligible. Couple days away.... let state people get it. Otherwise I'll drive 1000 miles home state. mention geography first place btw population density per sq kilometer much different either.. 3.3 australia vs 4 canada. australia comparable geographically also comparable population size density. 

Anyway ignore china...and vietnam atlantic canada three northern territories? Vietnam way smaller waaay higher population density imagine bode well pandemics.

""In contrast, much East Asia including China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, well Atlantic Canada three northern territories, opted elimination — strategy used global fight smallpox measles.""

From article itself. Lol getting 5-10 years nonsense from? I'm settled, feel free point anything wrong statement. I'm introverted AF far away mood improvement started therapy. Introvert here. Quarantine awesome. 9/10 would again. think key takeaway world over-accomodating one personality type neglected other. degree gap, any, learn facing job, particularly say majority learning job?

But sounds awesome. I'll check out. long take get 100k? tell I'm dough... stay home work. Sounds nice. weeks ago, 100 million people less vaccinated. Today, lot different. actually safer, people every right wary people like decided vaccine over. fully vaccinated month ago? were, id genuinelt suprised.

Even 2 week mark vaccine one, still feel safe even though fully vaccinated. still wear mask, go time see many people did.

Here's tip day, considering takes damn college kid teach this: learn perspective apply it. Im ready everything totally open yet, I'm angry college made split decision based situation going WILDLY different time opens.

Opinions change time goes situations change. Im sorry never learned concept, that's fault. Anyways, I'll enjoying life knowing kept others safe many others vaccinated, continue proceeding bit less caution  We're race time (and virus). fourth wave coming, vaccinate enough people time, nearly bad able protect people. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Yeah, I'll feel lot better 90%+ immunity there's like 4k daily new cases floating around US there's 65k daily new cases. I'm one unlucky ones, I'll still much less likely find there's lot less cases floating around. First Ivy League college(Cornell) requiring vaccinations fall semester.

Now Rutgers, Cornell requires students vaccinated, expect many join Pfizer gets full authorization adults able get bad thought process misunderstanding vaccine studies work. Go look mumps vaccine development approval time frame. bunch stuff parallel got quick Well shitty jobs like nursing home worker don’t attract brightest people. It’s pretty much last resort job. went outdoor bar tonight friend. liberating say least. got second Moderna shot last Thursday (9 days ago). surprised lot people wore masks indoor even tho it’s required. worried Covid fr first time year. nice!! That’s original &amp; uk variant, p1 variant b.1.3.5 first shot provide anywhere close Love assume I’m extrovert even asking this. I’m curious think extroverts gonna looking “revenge”  infringement freedoms. question whether infringement worth societal benefit.

Infringement probably best word it.

People's freedoms end another person's begin. People right able live lives without getting preventable diseases. mandatory vaccinations schools such.

If bunch stupid antivaxxers prolong pandemic restrictions lockdowns, far bigger affect people's freedoms.

The bigger danger government outsources incompetent contractor turns boondoggle. That, take long roll past usefulness.  think extend stopped crapping social Computer engineering, lot open positions good people, moved ""any position remote"" ideology. ...that's ridiculous anti vax propaganda website. would go then. Fully vaccinated playing outside seems pretty darn safe. :) Bit random one, hints/speculation US media whether foreign tourists might allowed back point year?

I've Pfizer jabs honest I'm absolutely gagging solo trip Southwest US again. I'm UK vaccine rollout far pretty solid, numbers gone wayy speculation travel happening year based 'traffic light system'.

Flight prices looking October/November pretty painful stage I'd willing pay get away 2 weeks lol yet, us bothered read article learned 100,000 people pier. Yeah, think life will--and importantly, *should*--be going back normal months. simple ""antivaxxers deserve it, everyone else safe"". know answers are, hopefully moot point enough people get herd immunity... believe people hoping treat way........people idiots. gonna go like that. trained life moment Well it’s anything like stuck inside extroverted husband...I feel pain. :) Thanks! yes awesome Moon think accounted people record data living? 

I responded guy said case numbers totally **irrelevant**. 

They aren't, never rated value comparison deaths per capita either, btw. 

If look testing per capita Dakota's bottom fucking list, per capita positive rate certainly can't solely attributed thorough testing. 

While deaths per capita Dakotas top exactly position brag either .. introvert although I'm still introvert definitely improved. going forward, want zero Covid nation, never lift quarantines. Ever. least another 5 -10 years. much ""rising cases."" least yet. 7 day average U.S. mild growth, states flat declining. Hospitalizations acceptable level. I'd agree commenter things quite good.

Remember U.S. lot people became immune hard way. anyplace else. pretty expected. Great see 65+ continue increase 74.4% 75.0%. think might stigma staying time disappeared. Personally didn’t feel bad home weekend friends parties whatever. Introverts stigmatized degree. hope told happy put damn mask on. I'm saying think good idea, think ridiculous. going happen. People already queueing Staples Office Depot take advantage free lamination offer. I've said posts CDC cards basically like appointment reminder cards dentist gives next cleaning, people treating like something else entirely. saying all, you. I’m pointing unobtrusive compared everything average person already deals day day basis don’t understand concern. mean, it’s nice see woman helped fund development Moderna vaccine finally get shot, waiting several months unnecessarily make sure others community first? introvert loving excuse boring get togethers loathe every year. can’t put price excuse avoid mother law, vaccinated sad visit people without..haha I'd argue now. mixing mRNA sequences bring total lower effectiveness? UK regulator said pattern single group affected cases. tracker accurate pinned Tweet Twitter No, people want to

Sadly, sums American response covid. end day, people need ask they'd willing sacrifice save someone's life. UK's response year actually pretty good--they locked crush surge, get numbers vaccine herd immunity start take over.

A significant reduction great! However, that's ""elimination"" risk. really think best cautious little longer. gonna long, ever-quickening pace vaccination sign. stop it, greatly reduces it. Like lot. know that, intentionally word sounded vaccines ineffective politics screw libs Masks work, 100%. know nose period time. lot different variables getting infected wearing mask introvert used recluse gotten mostly. back get again. UK regulator suggested pattern cases too. People seem pushing idea young women. case UK. Hahaha wonder you’re socially awkward, seem like genuinely terrible person see one would ever want anything CVS shows vaccine you’re signing for. Sucks girlfriend. many arrows quiver. Good luck good health Unless parent toddlers. boned either way. Glad hear! moving dinner accommodate celebrating immediate household big deal Water wet. News 11  Kinda weird mood totally shit since covid, I‘m actually introvert, maybe I‘m not? Choosing vaccinated something protected class, businesses right refuse service anyone long person they're refusing service belongs protected class.

Not serving gay folk they're gay folk? Can't bub.

Not serving person vaccinated, that's fine dandy. Open office exact opposite ADHD. USA USA USA says totally reasonable, people determined interpret says *the worst possible way*. Finally many states opening eligibility, vaccination rate actually increasing again. think entire country open 16+ across board. know facing looming threat fourth wave. almost surely prevent mass vaccination, many areas still focused narrowly targeted vaccination specific age groups. love Dolly!!!! love you!!!!!! little boy read free books send house. Thank beacon light. be. really hard. probably people town think I'm rude, care less idea I'm even slightly nudging social behavior toward accepting anti-mask b.s which, right now, well might mean could save someone's life I'll never know. Maybe not, everyone that, us would definitely unknowingly barrier susceptible person death covid.

I blow fuse anti-mask people anything, ask back away come anywhere near unless wear mask (properly). Thankfully, currently law requires masks public places reference get arguey mean see mean vaccination rollouts time high. 30% pop vaccinated millions getting vaccinated everyday. 

Here’s source Fauci saying 2022: Krispy Kreme asking vaccine cards.

😛 I'm like. enjoyed lockdown really seem affected mental health much. destroyed social skills. Getting habit forcing say yes things (and even initiate) terrible going take lot work get back. worn kn95 mask says made China since start. go grocery shopping weekly never failed me. flew internationally Caribbean 6 weeks Dec needed get test get plane back forth. see non vaccinated ppl can't same.  going say ""Wait science"" also need set benchmarks establish science shown diminishing returns protection due wide swath population protected vaccination prior infection. Otherwise suggest perpetual holding pattern end.

What going see happen people pointing places like Florida Texas, areas eliminating mask mandates uptick infections hospitalizations, new areas also sticking necks removing mask mandates. areas see appreciable uptick, follow. happened yet, we're seeing uptick cases right - people jumping gun little.

What needs communicated set benchmark demasking acceptable, suggest one: cases Covid par average year influenza. point, uptick demasking severe require additional restrictions later on; rates vaccination suggest hit point late May-early June. See easy was? benchmark proposed deadline. 1-2% J&amp;J far. point is, kids getting infected parents can't get vaccinated yet, even J&amp;j mrna 1 shot, month. long time pandemic. hope. Yes, numbers deteriorating slightly recent days weeks, nationally speaking. half states currently trending upward direction. world whole getting pounded right now, 7 day average worldwide rapidly approaching height winter surge. highly vaccinated countries hardly increasing all. hope believe means essentially woods, virus simply longer get enough foothold areas actually surge again. Fauci's recent statement 4th wave, think agrees this. seems completely totally unrealistic. cards easily forged unsuitable purpose. Hell, handed mine stack already filled date/manufacturer/batch number/location blank name/date birth, etc. things near useless anything personal health records. Thanks. know this, course. think hoping someone would come tell fine haha. Thanks humoring :) seem really bitter you’re sad loser 😂 Yeah right, long crime likely affect personally go ahead ignore lmao, fuck? May, 100+ million 1/3 US population fully vaccinated? Nice! I’m introverted I’m getting paid. feel lucky mood stayed like normal.  Sure adjustments overall mellow experience me. wish others would less rough time sure. alternative would require nasal swabs covid testing. could provide exception records showing vaccination covid. calling stupid? 

I'm calling stupid. complete idiot. read link posted? There's bar Denver requires one customers enter. Fucking 600,000 died masks restrictions. Get fuck shit. I’m gonna start biting people say saying, recent data indicates wrong. None us opinions experts. Biden admin working digital vaccine card, honestly support. business wants require vaccines workers customers that’s business. Something something hand free market I’m vaccinated family well don’t care catch resort things care? LOL read article. know supposed to? Smart. Mine Amazon, seller stellar reviews lot public information product. felt pretty confident buying them, they’ve treated alright! know one thing sure. works better cloth masks attempted sew last spring. Thanks great! Slowing definitely plateauing yet already said be. said masks + vaccines.  - Tests: 1,620,530 - Cases: 66,023 - Deaths: 758 - Currently Hospitalized: 36,913 - Currently ICU: 7,003 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

Source: Soon!!! look deaths age CDC website, actually pretty eye opening. feel like lot people think lot young people died havent all. Literally every major newspaper country pointed many new cases whole bunch states. plummet ended. willfully ignorant missed articles. thing need?

How much want bet we're going start seeing people wearing CDC Cards around neck lanyard safety pinned shirt like name badge near future? sense coming. Yeah

People burned ready accept risk escape emotional stress adhering pandemic restrictions plan needs hurrying vaccination fast one last blitz minimize final surge we're seeing people start easing back pre-pandemic lifestyles That’s preference. want “one done” Yes. Mine FDA approved dental supplier would get huge shit sold counterfeits news, water wet. Americans, men particular, see rule regulation straight MURDERING freedom. Primadonnas. Eternal victims. Things open city since last spring. depends definition ""high risk"". still states people late 50s eligible yet even though they're many times likely die COVID 20 year old preexisting conditions even though older age risky preexisting condition is. I’m getting exhausted people reading places reopening something returning saying “we’re never gonna get this”. Like fine y’all. Millions vaccinated people make bigger difference thousands people attending concert sure saw CDC age group chart all. arguing something making profit motivated capitalism. That's untrue. Many viral bacterial infections likely get vastly improved vaccines. fungal infections too.

Other applications future. Being. cautious till 2022 work

Are sure that's strawman? I, think cautious people, advocating careful months. really possible--and really save lives. Vaccines work population level, individual level, need wait least close herd immunity. We're nowhere near point US, soon. qualify need get it. J&amp;J one shot, two weeks, fully protected. Pfizer Moderna, one shot two weeks gives 80% protection. I’m introverted? ""This in, people like alone, liked alone"" ""Fauci-esque"" thing say. He's totally reasonable correct he's saying.

Here's said masking likely vaccinated, going spread infection, get infected without studies coming online now, going definitively prove that.” 

# “That's reason say happens, we'll pull back recommendation saying people vaccinated continue wear masks,”

And timeline we're looking get major surge continuation increase cases, conceivable may wear masks 2022,” noted. “But continue get people vaccinated, get overwhelming majority people together infected level infection goes way down, likely to.” 

As usual, everything he's said accurate. TECHNICALLY speaking, wait science completely settled science vaccinated transmission, ongoing covid restrictions another big surge happens coming months. just... tone-deaf. None going happen. science vaccinated transmission ""good enough"" already, least people consider be. damn near nobody intention wearing mask 2022. often does, Fauci trying conservative cautious epidemiologist should, recommendations realistic. CONGRATS!!!!!! mean can't racist blame country anymore? wonder 15M doses discarded impact J&amp;J numbers coming weeks  news, water wet. Cool. Sacrifice public health altar imaginary friends. expect legal action least one person.

Who cares? Ivy. see legal action dumbest shit per-day basis. Requiring vaccines already built codes, students agree matriculate. add/remove vaccines whenever want. COVID different. people trouble finding article. first image ""read more"" button  though? 2006 went undergrad, certain vaccines attend? well probably depends cdc changing recommendations really expect people tell wear condom blowjob say vaccinated people whatever hell want. they'll deal medical religious exemptions. Asymptomatic mild. almost unheard vaccinated person go hospital die it. concrete scientific evidence guarantees cannot still get infected asymptomatic level pass others. 

In words, nobody knows vaccines make immune infection well able make infection contagious. 

The evidence thus far vaccines protect deadly symptoms greatly reduce rate get mild symptoms. 

That mask sign selflessness willingness protect others well pretext since there's evidence vaccines prolonged protection well protections mutations could possibly exist now. 

I hope helps. Okay. Good know. lazy look known allergens J&amp;J. totally see happening. fact, I've witnessed introverted son. like (I used COVID, acted impeccably pandemics). said, think snappy social media. cannot post social media expect idiot comment underneath. Ah yes remember government made jogging illegal imagine much longer, maybe month two. Astra Zenica approved use US soon, possibly end month, give us four approved vaccines. Also, expanding rate daily injections, demand start dwindle. fucking sucks least governors voters answer to, can't keep bullshit everyone vaccinated. University admins answer NOBODY, power hungry assholes whatever hell want, they'll keep online classes save fortune. absolutely never said that. Almost friend's companies permanently closed offices already. There's nothing go back to. gone. Done.  Per capita, plenty EU countries worse county literally entirely Moderna vaccine supplied, cousin who’s 17 risk drive hour nearest CVS Pfizer I'm news water wet. chills bad want pull blanket *was convinced thin ham would tear*. lasted maybe 18 hrs. Turns blanket **not** ham. link mobility stats? I’d interested looking data It’s definitely innately easier control virus lower population density, definitely possible even high population densities 

My point Atlantic Canada actually much lower population density rest country. Maritime provinces smaller, much smaller cities much smaller populations. It’s kind unfair hold examples success you’re comparing Canada’s 3 smallest provinces smallest cities populations far larger urban centres. would kind shocking provinces didn’t fair better rest country. apt comparison would populous provinces like Ontario Quebec places like Vietnam insane? Already low risk college students vaccine, online classes purely money grab university. UGA vaccinated free came summer orientation meningitis updated vaccines needed updates free too. schools COVID. know we're still compiling info, really curious kind infection severity breakthrough cases having. Mild? Asymptomatic? Severe? UK done USA mean yeah, every American chance take vaccine gonna share. 

That’s plan whole time. aren’t yet hopefully soon. think matter come whether governor authority unilaterally impose regulations executive order sorts regulations require act Florida state legislature actual lawmaking process lawful.

Typically, executive order really directive executive government employees agencies control, actual lawmaking device.

So governor’s executive order directed state agencies require passports, would question whether that. directing private businesses FL abide personally imposed regulation? likely would stand court unless legislature already assigned power this.

Look New Brunswick vs North Dakota. international border, 3 subnational borders. 'fringe' country, major destination visitors. population 770,000 people, although New Brunswick almost triple density. Yet vastly different covid situations - North Dakota 104,000 cases 1500 deaths, New Brunswick 1600 cases 30 deaths. Government response really factor stands different. Includes religious medical exemptions reason sue. would rather do?

thats really scientific Maybe should?

I mean rest us felt exhausted last year, I'm going change hosting events, inviting people, trying see anyone everyone over, I've last year.

I'm changing introverts like it. April.. 3 months July, still wearing masks, vaccinated. Appreciate say thank you! long exactly ""some time"". I'm people feeling comfortable reminded coworkers (hospital) eagerly signed ASAP participants various published studies started receiving vaccines early March/April 2020. 

Is 1 year long enough? Good college getting vaccinated. Sending vibes minimal reactions! makes lot sense. Focus vaccine approved. Even tiny setback J&amp;J target meet delivery commitments, US beyond. AZ hand spotty deliveries. Everyone vaccinated able. Young people died covid. ignore generals guess. 'Those work support thise can't'. stupid thing said. Lmao fuck? No, normal people sound insane. Vaccines getting chip you. someone allergy vaccines disease can’t get vaccinated rely others herd immunity. able get vaccinated should, it’s moral obligation don’t go around killing immune compromised people babies higher risk certain diseases rest us. vaccine giving government control body, helps actively save people dying. Yes German implementation “lockdown” stopped working longer serves purpose. We’ve “crisis” restrictions since November entire time, government done literally nothing help situation. city, introduced curfew schools offices allowed remain open they’re vaccinating like three people day. It’s like want everything possible except things actually control third wave, putting us “worst worlds” situation.

Granted that’s people protesting Germany extremely dissatisfied things handled. thrilled getting first Pfizer dose Wednesday. vaccination process first started, thought way I’d vaccinated June July, yet, are. Let’s go! I've ran lot people day day life think covid big deal want get vaccinated specifically got J&amp;J one done vaccine. Basically they're like, ""fine I'll get stupid vaccine travel, I'm getting easy one."" already mentioned it.  clamp stabilize spike protein problem see complaints bitching social interactions people going forced months.

Millions people, sorts climates, sorts customer non customer facing fields, worn mask without problem understand mask supposed fit. Many also wear glasses problem.



You look moistening mask fast. may poorly fitting mask, low quality one well. Trust me, buy anything low quality, experience going suck. Shoes, car, couch, anything low end shitty. Weird emergency, want require things approved emergency use people situations directly applicable emergency.

But seriously. mandatory. mandatory want go school. totally optional.  day got J&amp;J, felt worse flu I’ve before. Next day, fine. brazen, implies really understand facts sides. it’s pure ignorance - stupid decisions made stupid assholes. reason nice it. going college next year. recommend getting vaccine getting close start college possible? I’ve heard vaccine loses efficacy period time. can't tell that's sarcasm. Honestly 1 hour jogging day probably would part counter significant portion overeating calories, significantly reduce anxiety/stress. would reduce overeating lot cases. 

I suspect lot people's lives would see massive increase health (mental physical) ran 1 hour day.

Now... Running hour day pretty brutal, especially shape... account fact hard get started cardio suffer depression “Honestly government require chips everyone. Renew drivers license - chip upgrade. File taxes - chip upgrade. Want passport - chip upgrade. question this?” 

Downvotes come me, normal, non partisan people, sound like. You’re asking give government complete control body Although wonder say SEA countries large tourism sector, cope able accept many foreign visitors before.

China big enough maybe switch internal tourism handle downturn, since challenge citizens travel abroad right now, go vacations inside Chinese borders. country like Thailand able prop tourism industry domestic travelers. Werent vaccines Pfizer Jonhson Johnson also developed outside US ?  isnt nih attitude (like say) vaccines ? sUrViVaL rAtE!!!!!

/s Based fuck ups AZ really blame skepticism product. 

If US could pick 30 mn J&amp;J doses, 30 mn AZ doses, pretty obvious one they'd take. People sub trying force extroverts introvert lifestyle post covid too. know many comments sub screaming need limit gathering POST covid? comment hilarious. Truly hilarious. Thank making day 

To start off, vaccines don’t “struggle” it. Modest decreases neutralizing titers observed testing variant post vaccination sera, far less B1.135 

Second, regions P.1 actually outcompeted B.117

I really love comments high fumes author fiend realize ridiculous comment Ok Quad Mutant strain strikes? Octo-Variant? reason young person get vaccinated Right, antivax views people manifest less extreme conspiracy beliefs hidden *concerns* desire medical research less *political.* Intellectual-seeming people find intellectual-seeming ways faulty belief, arising apparently logical coherent premises. 

Source: go one places. antivax/vax-skeptical students lol Yeeeeeppppp. Sounds right. Ashe center still useless didn’t say explicitly, announcement said masks would required lot immunity campus (but full herd immunity), didn’t say anything there’s herd immunity. So, probably getting rid restrictions maybe waiting updated CDC guidance actually say so. Let’s see; Ted cru... parents money.

Donald tru... parents money.

Really drawing blank here. CDC guidelines make sense. push CDC vaccinate ""essential workers"" first elderly back November. promote ""equity"". almost EVERYBODY got vaccine, achieve herd immunity. told time 2nd Covid vaccine wait 2 weeks month socializing trust getting vaccinated staying safe properly. Still wear mask public. MANY states longer mandating masks! BEWARE...it's soon! india media calling “double mutant” total bullshit. fact news source calling “double mutant” embarrassing I’m glad media outlets pointing 

Most coronavirus variant *more* two mutations. Quite bit more. B.117, B.1.135, P.1 lineages substantially 2 mutations. mutations found Indian variant, one already present California variants E484Q, mutation similar identical E484K concerning, “double mutant” naming pure sensationalist crap. Two mutations nothing special all. don’t see it’s bad idea. think anti vaccine people literal plague society. don’t need them. want opt out, decide they’re welcome. goes anti mask people. don’t want play rules, take ball go home.

Source-I read subreddit always vaccine hesitant people. come around people around get vaccine. J&amp;J perfect shot vaccine hesitant. one dose convenient. mean sub constantly cries US? It’s present PNW California British strains infectious. Given aren’t seeing reinfections meaningful scale (we millions recovered Covid people - meaningful would mean rate positivity nonimmune propels would match ‘immune’) don’t think anything worry guess I'm pretty extroverted classic example misleading headline, disappointing coming reputable news source like Reuters 

The “most” they’re referring 10 14 cases documented. technically headline telling truth strictly speaking “most” cases, way it’s phrased makes seem like substantial amount found. good. everyone choose get vaccinated anything major health reason get absolutely fucked. NIH always skeptical AZ vaccine clamp stabilize spike protein. nih (not invented here) attitude productive. UK vaccinating AZ working. Remember extroverts pulling constantly trying make stuff/crowding everything next year.

If best year life, going back normal best ours. Covids kind random though. direct contact roommate (maskless since live together) day tested positive (he didn’t get result next day, get tested twice week students). Logically should’ve contracted didn’t complete bullshit apologetics here. He’s completely right. anecdotal experience, school used covid reasoning force students dorms, cut funding clubs, close facilities gyms such. plenty ways issues could avoided, believe school realized much money saving used advantage.  Sounds like America lives head rent free friends, outside three introverts knowI would loved virtual hangouts. hardest thing handle. thrive around people energies me. I've spent entire time depressed, partly die loosing lifetime riding horses gone due surgery. Aren’t vaccines essentially non-sterilizing? pretty much rules immunity end goal, right? gotta go applebees hamburger berate waitress!! bet fall rolls around vaccinated, nobody going keep stuff up. summer full vaccinated people taking vacations going restaurants, nobody give shit anymore. Agreed.

That said, extrovert lifestyle going demanded lot people summer. Introverts going lot social pressure stuff. Reinfections happen. fact existing vaccines work Brazil variant however makes likely bad luck, vaccine escaping mutation Read comment again. yeah im aware went Holy Cross well non-Jewish Israelis let’s ignore rationale assume don’t want get vaccinated. time lockdown

\- People freely move 10km home without justificiation 

\- lockdown starts monday, police asked let people travel place want spend lockdown (so Rich people Paris move house countryside poor people stay stuck 30 m² apartment)

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm EU country we've barely vaccinated people 60:( mostly sucks second dose 3 months first, that's still quite long wait. AstraZeneca made major mistakes fairly inexcusable major pharmaceutical. manufacturing issue led half doses trial. tracking trial FDA conspiracy. FDA also independent pharmaceuticals. FDA get money pharmaceuticals fairly strict COI protections around FDA good reason. choose skin colour? choose vaccinated? 

Oh. also good news us young people, one thrilled old parents travel see grand kids again. Even still can't yet.

(however, think father get AstraZeneca would mean gets second dose 3 months...) ""wreck people"" equate ""feel shitty days, actual risks long-term effects""? 

Considering COVID's worst-case equivalent ""wrecking people"" literally killing them, seem comparable.

Unless think vaccine kinda hidden long-term effects discovered yet, guess *possible,* far there's evidence support theory science indicates unlikely. definitely sentiment first lockdown. Everyone expecting normal Christmas. know things changed towards winter though. Nothing prohibits discriminating unvaccinated people. Lawsuits, sure. reputation value company would surely forever ruined, no? Exactly, Cornell. Hey bot. actually read wrote ? level dumbness unreachable. faculty staff requierd vaccinated too? makes sense. remember seeing logic 30 year old girl died within week taking vaccine Utah, doctor said hard prove vaccine cause. listening interview days ago doctor touting safety AstraZeneca vaccine saying hard say vaccines triggering event leading blood clots gad underlying conditions.

Based I've seen described vaccines would 0 probability causing deaths, unlikely.

I know validity numbers I'm going logic, someone dies shortly taking vaccine would say whatever health issues exasperated taking vaccine, can't live society like forever well, risk needs taken eventually everyone. least forgot tell country taskforce telling expected 0 vaccines week. 

And pushing plant AZ J&amp;J: US plant made both, that’s case here. 
Also, don’t think there’s law EU dictate that. It’s also difficult switch like since start 0. Might take 2-3 months get started, let alone produce decent amount.  HQ UK, British side merger (Zeneca) bigger Swedish side (Astra). Still, british-swedish firm maintains good amount operations Sweden well. UK ahead 1st vaccinations mostly, provide level protection, think like 70%. slowing though catch 3 month 2nd vaccinations gap. 

I see US overtaking us soon, ""indoor meeting allowed"" restrictions lifted coincide 2nd doses taking effect.  Wow, woman lost whole family COVID. husband kids aged 33 38. That's extremely tragic. I'm guessing genetic abnormality never realised know makes feel better, walk feel Cruz's parent's money got Princeton valedictorian class, etc. 

It takes lot money influence get automatic admission Ivy Leagues immigrant upper middle class. Source ? EU India complain lot ban raw materials export US affecting them. reciprocity one giving give goes back actual expert fucking calls eek. It’s either SA/Brazil variant E484K 3,999,999 others realise US UK also placed orders Sanofi last year? 
As matter fact UK bought Sanofi vaccines Pfizer ones. I'd say save excitment bill comes. Probably grand so. how’d go him? EU diplomatic strength this. never, ever happen. US would destroy idiots: Government interfere companies conduct business

Government: Ok, free deny access unvaccinated people wear mask.

These idiots: No, like that... Indian media like double mutated version Fox news  Actually, liquid ban planes foiled [2006 Transatlantic 9/11...but point taken anyway. Good news 5-6 weeks strict quarantine mid-March 2020, tapering restrictions another weeks community cases hit zero. large initial influx returning citizens, strict quarantine controls border.

Is easier New Zealand set islands? course. Doesn’t mean impossible elsewhere though (e.g. Vietnam) lmao, okay tough guy part ""the US gets JJ doses EU"" think false, then? think fact less effective, requires two doses gives people brain hemorrhages That’s awesome! I’m happy you. Yes, that's case every vaccinated virus history. vaccinate every citizen take vaccine, get rid precautions (masks), virus wont exist general long populous gets vaccine. That's life works. isn't. give people fewer incentives get vaccinated ultimate goal here.  That’s plan is. Everyone work social circles at-risk already vaccinated, expect get mine coming weeks. I’ll still keep mask car go store restaurant, I’m wearing anymore. people understandably sick this. like Germany close end everyone asked patient. Ugh mean I’m introvert cause pretty sure extravert. Also, unlike introverts say, don’t miss anything all. found substitutes spend time useful stuff that’s still possible now. postponed rest later. might plain psycho then? *laughs nervously* Ok yeah isolated different. see that. ohio even strictest lockdown, could go socially distanced walk. Now, places open limitations. local parks open limited hours groups 6 less open. 

Where can’t take walk? thought places allowed hour outside exercise least strictest lockdown. states USA went serious lockdowns. Sorry, bitches give religion. get nothing. hope good news key term 'pre-clinical' Good news old people According 'our world data', Germany administered 14 million people.

&amp;#x200B;

(Note: know might joking, I've seen much nonsense sub vaccination vaccination rates.) expecting droves vaccinated college kids die? Wow actually saint  good Oops... quite right, thanks. worry about. dead long watched documentary ""Born Rich"" ago, basically ""behind scenes"" wealthy families mainly NY, even Ivanka Trump makes appearance saying broke are. 

One thing struck kids part set life. shit rest lives, searched stuff do, art one them. Given new development, US export ban general, set back AZ production least 6 months. see EU circumstances allow export anything US longer. introvert lives social busy city, went 5x6 times week socializing none stop (even introvert way got spend time husband due work) travelling across seas twice year, home tiny apartment teenager extroverted husband 

My relationship teen amazing. close now. She’s little behind school knows cook, make music, meditate stuff like that, focused mental health found self

My relationship husband interesting. reliant around people give energy. got bit online gaming occasional bubble hang. clearly struggled big time. almost different person started. closest means get effects. mentally declined it. I’m half person was. went loving lockdown half ass working lying time. locked locked with. 

This pandemic showed maybe aren’t best fit long term shame. really see people’s pros cons spending 24/7 together. retirement like us don’t want retire him. 

I’m looking forward going maybe half time. hand doesn’t want spend anytime home over. I’m hoping everything settles everyone gets going extremes system nice balance comprise want work things get mental health back track. I’m anxiety going want see old friends crowds making controversial? Fair enough. read Swedish - I'm sure Wikipedia said read - rate appear British-Swedish said, even Wikipedia. important ""locally produced""?

This legumes farmer's market. even make sense compare two like that?

Here's actual overview covid vaccinations different locations (see EU vs India, add Germany like):

Absolute doses per day: per day per capita: ) gone, bot. exactly Europe wrong, WAY late mRNA party (mostly bought AstraZeneca solution everything, giving lip service mRNA) . Europe even ready transport mRNA vaccine buy time approved. fucking stupid.

Germany realised this, ultimately forced European commission done months before. 

The problem is, way late bring production EU back line production brought time meet demands EU export customers sit around negotiating table fucking months. 

Instead , Merkel done buy enough mRNA vaccines Europe, probably France , Italy Netherlands, maybe others get contract done WAY sooner EC would done. 

Would cost per vaccine higher? sure. ultimately would saved lives money (in fucking lockdowns) Merkel could still rescuer Europe. like Twitter much better.

myspace was, that's long gone.
(because myspace easily indexable content. basically free form HTML non-real-name user accounts) extremely disappointing worrying many people think good thing.

1. People already COVID-19 taking vaccine already immune vaccinating someone recently infected currently infected introduces unnecessary risks. 

2. rule changed ""required immunity"" requires vaccination. 

3. testing vaccines testing efficacy safety, fully understand health risks associated vaccines. Certainly understand long term health risks. students wish take wait see approach forced get vaccinated drop out. (The article mention non-vaccinated students view lectures online).

It unfortunate US become extreme ignores science disagrees ideology.

Please stop thinking black white way try think things through. Vaccine skepticism inherently bad thing. say someone vaccinated themselves, i'm *anti vaxxer* all.

It seems remarkably sure vaccine safe effective, yes. long term data simply can't know longer term risks. probably say reasonable certainty potential risk lower present risk covid, least reasoning taking it. go age groups logic becomes less less true. Unknown risk vs minimal risk covid easy sell.

Skepticism general *positive* trait find hard judge someone concerns legitimate well reasoned. Usually people spoken too, unlike anti vaxxer remain entrenched position forever. Wow, excellent news 12 people Germany vaccinated Folks would sign much superior Dartmouth. Good thing add bit data: vaccination doses per inhabitant shows different order -- ) [Myocarditis also caused viruses, including common cold flu meaningless say covid causes it, without talking much often compared viruses, illness likely serious. Myocarditis cause serious symptoms including death, also consequences. [And looks like first studies covid-19 myocarditis overestimate probability meaningful heart want careful try catch covid kinds reasons, sudden heart inflammation death rare (I'm even sure there's clear covid case, although know could happen) probably damage mental health thinking it. 

As case, people infectious right right symptoms start, mom likely infecting anyone longer. That's precautions sound little overblown - get her, already did. Hopefully - actually, already past point would likely gotten sick. honestly don’t fall press Exactly, makes wonder, gap longer 12 weeks order give people first jab? surprised all. learned I'm even better alone thought (&amp; pretty good already).

I could easily another year ""pandemic life"" without sickness &amp; dying. Friends getting vaccinated starting ask want get together (I not).  Actually swedish/uk company.  UK built last year only. Trudeau busy wooing Winnie Pooh. Netherlands one country inside EU. mean whole EU exporting vaccine US.

June July, BioNTech, J&amp;J Moderna production full speed able finish vaccination groups. Good times coming ! source completely wrong. single dose J&amp;J filled finished Netherlands. simply facility capacity needed. filled Germany US. ever see commercials asking harmed drug made many smart people FDA approval started harming people? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Living aside credibilty author, let's see sources quoted says:

""During time, VAERS received 2,509 reports death (0.0017%) among people received COVID-19 vaccine. CDC FDA physicians review case report death soon notified CDC requests medical records assess reports. A review available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, medical records revealed no evidence vaccination contributed patient deaths.""

So, talking 2509 people dead receiving vaccine, received vaccine. Quite opposite, link established vaccine cause death.

Hint: allways read primary sources, possible, statements made. Even author say ""people died vaccines"" (I guess feel like going court), says ""died receiving vaccine"". technically true, suggests connection exist. fuck headline  May please whatever medicine take fix this..I’ll pay top dollar. I’ll even give cat Cdc also recommends daily exercise MUST fake news. common conspiracy theory. PCR tests perfect, accurate tool establish Covid status. Kinda. Compared 80s/90s. always provide vaccine records get TB test too. got vaccine shot last week! 


...the flu shot, covid, way vaccination process rolling Brazil, think i'll vaccinated next year (2022). least better nothing this, March 2020? Let save 70% coronavirus patients tested Tokyo hospital last month carried E484K mutation, nicknamed ""Eek"" scientists known reducing vaccine protection, said public broadcaster NHK.

They're using ""Eek"" blanket term variants E484K, specific new VoC. means hardship people facing much worse anything ever experienced, clearly seem care Well, think required yet given everyone get right now, mean fall everyone wanted chance already. Kary Mullis says little different Precedent: Polio vaccine already required. Three weeks first dose you’re already mostly protected. I'm hoping anything. jurisdictions falling cases too, variants hit. Even 3 million vaccinations day reach herd immunity time get ahead restrictions. coming guy told everyone masks nothing offer false sense security. let get straight, President United States, took production facility **PRIVATE** company called ""Emergent"" mistake, gave responsibility factory J&amp;J completely sidelined production another vaccine producer (AZ).

That's China-level stuff right here...

This sub would've gone nuts EU EU country would've done something similar., people see hyporitical are? country? Damn. guess taken cancer vaccine. Ha ha, no, least lockdowns (not whole pandemic!). Moderna arm still feels slightly tender three days later. started getting better around 24h mark. Friendly reminder Apollo app translation.  It’s habit. live NY people barely step foot outside door unmasked.  I'm thinking heading back US summer get shot. Hope choose vaccine early August. J&amp;J would ideal since dose.

It’s forced, attend want. “science” show otherwise. mean Covid isn’t airborne infectious virus. don’t want wearing mask rest life Going school isn’t right. sit year you’re worried. yep Vaccine thing much situation you, tried look ibuprofen ok take whether might mess process. answer found googling ""we know sure, probably ok, take *before* shot."" hope future perfect vaccines wonder exactly much better disease cure is. headline correct, even specifies ""Tokyo hospital cases"". many hospitalised cases think single hospital Japan, 2k cases yesterday, would have? still risk mainly one developing abroad rather US. give virtual feet (🦶) answer. I’m wondering could different recoding metrics, ‘Kent’ strain believed lethal circulating longer UK. believe obesity higher UK know care homes got hit pretty hard also would also contribute. conjecture though would defer source knowledgeable. Things starting fully reopen 2021. Bulk public isn’t willing even wait months governors caving. Feel free fun masking indefinitely. I’m Canadian say lots people mad. personally don’t mind much. 2 months behind. want us fully vaccinated new school year understand environment like college campus literally 100% people vaccinated still requiring masks physical distancing. Yeah trial nearing completion, they'll submitting EUA month unless something else happens. country, antivaxx comic circulating dialog nurse person vaccinated, something like this:
Patient: great! finally travel right?
Nurse: no
Patient: stop wearing mask?
Nurse: no
Patient: friends family?
Nurse: shouldn't
Patient: least keeps infecting infected right?
Nurse: know! 😂😂 right. even think twice states already require vaccines campus well tell Peace 2021 longer strange feeling January-Feb 2020 think reality 

&amp;#x200B;

also Good Measure Said Jumanji New Years 2021 Disney could tell go fuck choice matter. Yep! First all, Pfizer along ride, managed clinical trial manufacturing. BioNTech invented mRNA vaccine, Pfizer probably least profit companies. BioNTech investn mRNA covid, cancer cure, lot money $10-$40 shot charge vaccine. Hospitals US charge aspririn that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The GOV invested AstraZeneca, ironically. front runner seemed promising summer 2020, bought 400M doses part OWS time. Even recent additional purchases J&amp;J/Moderna doses, AZ still leads pack. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fauci last week commented need AZ get herd immunity summer. compare two, Emergent issues impacts vaccines aside, J&amp;J superior AZ. One-shot done, cleaner clinical data, mention already approved. Also, J&amp;J showed efficacy variants they're finishing 2 shot study, provide options (but need vaccines that) Sounds quite illegal, unless incentive like bonus something. international travel already require Proof vaccination? seriously should. live state strict lockdowns (thanks wolf). I’ve never asked vaccine card anything, I’ve living life pretty normally. first dose shit kept home, me. way around ? good news 7 person France vaccinated, 3 Belgian, 4 Dutch, 10 Poles ? 

Today, go Germany, need fill lot papers, get negative PCR test (Then extra one coming back) weeks, show vaccination card. 

This lead another question, see end 70+ healthcare worker, get priority, 50+ front line worker ? frequent international traveler ? kind measure see priority shifting *front line worker* international traveler I’m talking CDC card, vaccine passport. choice everyone chance get vaccinated. going scale up? not, AZ chance beating Pfizer/BioNTech terms production capacity. situation known like - example limiting curve 70 km/h, telling truth lead deaths. measured. requirement put sign saying ""70"".

I'd prefer people would used lied to, too.  Im sure vaccines Come get N95 stay vigilant till Still shitty CDC card. point nobody asking CDC card. Germany. Deaths numbers much lower, new infections still pretty high. scientists said last wave, vaccinations go well, reason optimistic (had) friend like that. reason taking break him. France vaccinated people % total pop vaccinating faster absolute numbers.......... 2 billion Good point. take street drug moon shine made lord knows this...?

Anyone group immune issues free get vaccine choose worry me. conjunction that, wear mask supposed social distance. quarantined sick. work outdoors away people. natural antibodies time being. point allowed consider wellbeing called selfish?
The main argument I've heard immune deficient people can't get vaccine due allergies reasons. But, correct I'm wrong, I'm scientist means. vaccine considered leaky vaccine, still catch transmit virus. working properly vaccine turns vaccinated potential asymptomatic carriers. unvaccinated population (due personal choice allergies) fear vaccinated rather vice versa? are... government mandates vaccination consequence major fines jail times non compliance going endorse it? No, definitely running start.  Oxford facility built last year, construction completed 2019 serious investments prior years, 4 manufacturing suites approved last year MHRA.

Michigan fewer deaths per million populous states group lower vaccination rates. presumably less immunity. Unsurprising Lol we've actually come long way since year ago. Trust me, I've used arguments.

EU peeps think get vaccine doses first. Get real. Pfizer definitely along ride. would read long relationship learn little more. scheduled Pfizer vaccine Thursday, wish luck! legal considering vaccines approved emergency use? Seems like huge overreach? think we'll look back regret let people get recover COVID naturally. Would much faster path herd immunity.

It's dice roll micro level sure. macro statistics regarding hospitalization rate deaths.

I think Michigan example effect. Cue downvotes post deleted. Johnson Johnson baby powder recalled asbestos in.

I’m sure rules (public) schools honest. know uni it’s even mentioned. think living situations quite similar - first year lived big housing block 19 people 1 tiny kitchen... absolutely horrendous! hope you’re right, although we’ve hearing “expect mask every shift next year” recently management. 

Mandates may go away policies take lot longer.  I’m sorry. can’t let sit without saying obvious. 

I don’t think trump administration would given 0 vaccines January April, really doubt would done well. 

They objectively pro-virus. 0 plans mobilizing federal response help vaccination efforts (FEMA, Mass Vax sites, national guard, J/J + Merck partnership, etc).

I hope see irony. You’re dramatic again. Quit dramatic.

No. feel like you’re trolling not:

Because you’re condescending it. Also judging people whose status unknown. could fully vaccinated, recently recovered tested negative. 

If you’re fully vaccinated congrats stop shaming judging others enjoy life. either way, kids kept going even hard lockdowns… kids wearing masks going downfall… aliens onto something anal probe thing? 🤔  German vaccine. global company Pfizer dosage eu un govt said well make gonna lay sword.

A good amount redditors don’t realize economy conducted zoom. actual people need jobs, people getting decimated lockdown. even mention amount damage caused young kids whole home schooling lack socializing peers. vaccines conversation cons outweighing pros lockdowns promise path back normal Something seems different it’s hard put finger on. original point people feeling uncomfortable intended appeal sense empathy highlight wearing mask matter simple courtesy respect requires little sacrifice part mask-wearer. disappointing argument devolved facts vs feelings thing, reason masks still encouraged health experts. realize poor line argument, I'm happy drop it.

The broader reasoning health experts much consider simply whether vaccinated people transmit disease. manage entire society, requires keeping many things balance once. 

1) make *any* recommendations rooted strong scientific evidence, hence they've waited say vaccinated people travel, took long time confirm asymptomatic spread etc.

2) keep mind difficult enforce voluntary compliance across entire country hundreds millions people. means assuming *only* vaccinated people lose masks. assume remove mask *mandates*, unvaccinated people also stop wearing masks. sub seems think fine letting people opt mask usage necessary, obvious fact pandemic proven people refuse even bare minimum.

3) right people going put much longer, CDC telling vaccinated people go ahead gather together, travel, see family, etc, matter still wear mask grocery store plane? seems like they're throwing huge bone people sick lives hold, really understand people complaining about. 

We'll drop mask mandate enough people vaccinated, minor annoyance mask (seriously, anyone really used now?) seems worth since entire society try manage here. Well seeing pregnant women growing human need extra 200-400 calories/day depending trimester, answer question probably 0  [link Cali vari POLITICAL fucking moron nazi. list top 21 states terms death. surprised would include COVID vaccination list vaccinations. am, however, surprised able require vaccine EUA. slightly 30%, significantly higher dad warning going stuff even though fully vaccinated (both Moderna) variants. dad means well think worrying bit much especially light recent evidence MRNA vaccines work really well real world people *by far* likely get seriously ill, hospitalized, die Covid largely protected. That’s great news. 

“No one ever get sick” wasn’t goal. Vaccinations working exactly should, protect vulnerable first. Keep getting shots arms! anybody still listen guy?  MODERN DEFINITION! Plus, even was, wildly innacurate classify everything country TWO FUCKING GROUPS. What? That’s stupid! can’t even fucking fathom it. approved FDA. think ever Florida think swamp... efficacy measure *reduction* infection (or whatever trying reduce e. g. hospitalization death) compared untreated group.

for example sample 2000 subjects. 1000 vaccinated 1000 vaccinated.

if 100 unvaccinated got infected compared 5 vaccinated, efficacy (100-5)/100 = 95%. that's reduction 95 every 100.

if 0 vaccinated got infected, efficacy 100%.

if 100 vaccinated got infected, efficacy 0%. literally 1000 times likely die COVID allergic reaction. dunno. Maybe whole lot people live swamp? can't dumb. assume troll. Might well ask spread jungle empty desert fucking sea. Broccoli Rob broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard boner champ. Meningitis get pretty nasty tho  aids. Next question. moral obligations ended second got vaccinated. life theater point. willing wait vaccines available public.

I willing wait wearing masks like Fauci many others suggesting. waiting kids. waiting anti vaxxers. longer waiting case counts/deaths. 

I perfectly content moral stance honestly longer care others think.

Even maximum immunity, definitely significantly protected within 2 weeks dose 1. hate tell this, California, teachers unions preventing school starting.

No can't. safe vaccine available, never bothered test children. There’s zero indication existing approved vaccines unsafe ineffective them, it’s likely exact vaccines we’re injecting millions adult arms every day eventually approved children. paperwork problem.

Here's better quote new CDC study provides strong evidence mRNA COVID-19 vaccines highly effective preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections real-world conditions among health care personnel, first responders, essential workers. 

Anyway, hundreds breakthrough cases multiple states suggest they're going revise statement.  

Or least take account people health care personnel, first responders, essential workers.

I think want avoid mentioning breakthrough cases likely get anti-vaxxers excuse say ""see vaccines work"". J&amp;J 74% effective preventing infection. Real world data suggests mRNA vaccines 80% effective. Breakthrough cases occur 100% effectiveness possible. herd immunity important. everyone around 80% protected infection 80% protected, actual risk reduction 96% something [CDC vaccine age data today?

Sure, choose believe I'm gaslighting you. clear, accusing me, internet stranger, psychological abuse said dramatic think people say wear masks imposing moral ideology you? answer yes, agree disagree, response calling dramatic is....dramatic.
 agree

So saying agree wear masks every adult wants vaccine “Just wear mask we” Hard stop. I’m done.

You see statements contradict theater vaccinated.

No disagreement me. growing consensus purpose vaccinated people wearing masks continue normalize behavior. everyone wants vaccinated is, drop them. One thing confused study controlled mask use. Certainly people cohort wear masks maybe exceptions ""front line workers"" group like 20% vaccinated group. think unless somehow controlled it, vaccine + mask = % effectiveness. comment effectiveness transmissibility unless caveat % measures too. scratching head. That's crazy. even supposed give aspirin people age 20 fever related viruses like flu small risk Reye's syndrome. ???

Factually False. 5% fatal mean fatality rate around even uncertainty taken account, still find COVID-19 high fatality rate - order 1% typical high-income country. risk concentrated older ages, probability dying COVID-19 doubling approximately every eight notable fact 10% people become long haulers. affect people around you. Please get vaccine stay rock benefit rest us. 

Thanks,

Those common sense. Start planning appointments 2 weeks up. It’ll make feel better. Also, depending city live in, risk getting lower lower. chances take precautions (mask, social distance) good things. healthy medium minimize risk keep sanity still going things. Vaccinated + masks + cases going great combo allow us things used (with added precautions) keep things trending downward. currently ""Lockdown""? go park, hardware store? like shot 🚀 🚀 🚀 showed hair appointment full two weeks early completely lost concept time...whoops Chile using Russian Chinese vaccines? seems effective. felt last month US even hard get vaccines elderly. Suddenly last weeks appointments popped everywhere became really easy get shots. think EU get point month so. Masks eradicated Spanish Flu? entirely false. 

Please remove post 80% first dose only, no? thank people care keep spreading damn virus. also educated populace country, likely means among lowest rates vaccine hesitancy absolutely agree.    

All Im saying restrictions lifted based risk level people Ill happily help revitalize economy. reasoning dont want bad example might make people less likely follow rules.

Teachers undervalued, overworked, unverpaid.

We cannot expect teachers risk health lives.

Most students thrive learning remotely.

**You cannot push reopen schools without addressing safety teachers.** 

 think people need research rate teachers leaving profession, amount teachers quitting retiring high, amount people entering profession low. enough teachers, enough substitute teachers. We're also driving qualified individuals. need address quickly. Ontario we're seeing surging ICU cases younger crowd. We're already past number ICU cases peak last wave wave getting started. 

For us, caused cases deadly UK variant time.

If hospitalizations staying down, that's good thing.  mean, I've dentist seeing friends outside. things fine. dentist wear extra coverage obviously. smart cautious, isolate madness. going 3-4 mile walk every day cutting beer bread gone long way towards keeping sane. barely. worked anything meaningful, I've stayed date job, veg televsion/youtube every night. I've got 10 days 2nd shot clears I'll looking forward get mobility life. 

I've made positive steps last 3-4 months pandemic, whole big pause year feeling sorts alone. seeing many assholes politics, antimask, etc. Can't wait shit over. Lol deserved trial, ended months ago. 5 patients, results published.   Example #32,307 next week they’re going tighten restrictions everyone can’t get vaccinated time soon poor decisions. first flu shot ever received (when first invented) gave side effects. receive annual booster never sore arm. I'm expecting covid boosters same. There's reason be. Yep, kills everything. 92% effective based 20,000 participant study, good vaccine. bit sketchy started using publishing full trial results, eventually published Lancet (a peer-reviewed medical journal). similar J&amp;J Oxford/AZ vaccines uses viral vector, except uses different vector second dose, allows potent booster body sensitized vector virus second dose. 100% POPULATION VACCINATED GIVEN AREA HERD IMMUNITY BRAINLESS SHIT MINDED FUCK anywhere near revolutionary antibiotics vaccines - much efficient way producing vaccines medications. least many cases. guarantee need boosters. Shortly Christmas, went ER thinking COVID might going ""happy hypoxia"" -- felt fine, O2 levels dropped 80s walk flight stairs without getting short breath.

Explained symptoms admitting nurse, isolation room available me, booked me, hooked supplemental oxygen, started running tests.

Turned negative COVID bad bilateral pulmonary embolism... that's story spent Christmas 2020 ICU. That’s school board, though, actual teachers. Lol! Yeah I've reported bad actors before, mods really seem care. going pay parents quit jobs stay home kids? thank God! want judged bunch pansie-ass historians two hundred years now! feel like “going back normal” dependent whether vaccines stop transmission herd immunity kids getting shots. they’ll probably least let vaccinated people (and exempt health reasons) hook. Ah, okay. flairs disabled see it. Thanks! vaccines actually fully approved. one isn’t. Huge difference one spreading misinformation. Almost certain Russian bot Vaccination medical diagnosis. Neither age. think willing, think? remember correctly, Bavarian ever made chancellery. I'm keen CSU, Soeder sound OK. I'm appalled anyone would. People really disappoint terrify days. top 4 million injections per day. looks good. Believed. I’m sorry mass community spread November January NYC? conducted surveillance testing time, not? High education, good infrastructure, older average many parts country. MI. NJ. NY. NC. up.

Texas case count stopped dropping March 25 headed back up. governor get bought big walgreens cuz pharmacy chains getting doses states lol don’t think teachers union opposition F2F didn’t apply political pressure? Also, political pressure pediatric association under? speak Nothing really guess. It’s big situation going thought worth mentioning. drop data released public next month It’s since 2nd week. want shit man work one biggest districts country. I'm high school, 3 children three different schools (one elementary, one middle, one autism catchment program), facilities. 

I get least 2-3 emails weekly combination 4 schools + 1 building students staff testing positive. also know always get emails positive cases I've students classes test positive trigger schoolwide email home. 

My school also listed outbreak center state DH site. never notified - saw looking cases. 

Data strong accurate reporting happens accurately reported taking weeks/months get information out?

Despite research shows children shed virus adults research showed closing schools sooner lowered mortality rates localities research states antibodies staying long enough system herd immunity possible despite data, still pushing reopening schools safe. now, we're getting variants virus infecting people. 

I understand anecdotal data make feel certain way actual data support pushing back person rushed. Time nuke kids Hospitalization rate around 20% recorded cases roughly 20% 20% die. hard calculate new hospital admissions divided new cases. course working, forcing people room. Especially new rules following variants. lot viral amongst people traditionally vulnerable (of based entire premise freedom efforts liberty minded people.) 
Quebec's vaccine situation 3rd world country level. Hell 3rd world countries better rate us. 

Not sure i'm getting downvoted tho. seems rather clear. Hopefully people understand what's happening right similar last february. aren't. States restrictions like Texas Florida seeing new ""waves"" all.  US donated fuck all. loaned vaccines use. equally unacceptable. even covid spreads, less deaths older generations vaccinated. Exactly. stuck early on, could back normal now. yes is.

multiple states reporting hundreds cases breakthrough infections fully vaccinated people.

Like near tell, CDC acknowledged data yet mean data statement true. Data speaks itself. really driving wave? Please, proof measles vaccine required school enrollment play sport. 

You ignorant history. 

Hilarious bars check government ID order gain entry. 

The Horror!!! Bruh kids like zero risk Covid kids risk going vaccinated US within month two. might dumbest shit I've ever read🥱 weren’t vaccinating 3-4m people day, might agree. don’t see happens point game. experience classes, there's interactive non-interactive classes. philosophy classes 15 students discussed individual issues arguments. also classes 200 watched professor read textbook-provided powerpoint slides. And, course, tons things between. think classes closer former remain, latter easily replaces asynchronous learning. It’s like went one extreme other. mentioned before,these people mean well poor communicators. 
Dr Scott Gotlieb one expert level headed good listen EU need figure things indigenously. 

They *do* need honestly look mistakes made repeat them. 

But people sub least refuse so, placing hands ears singing ""La la la vaccine nationalism la la la.""

The EU's mistake place large early orders *all* vaccine candidates, even risk wasting money overpaying slightly. 

No one US bitching US wasted $1 billion Sanofi's non-viable vaccine, another $1 billion Merck &amp; Cos. non-viable vaccine.

And one EU today complaining prices either. 

The idea would huge miscalculation based - presumably - France's H1N1 experience. 

Pre-ordering 400 million Pfizer/BNT doses *and* 400 million Sanofi doses would gone long way toward fixing supply issue. consider FDA approval. do, still completely shit. Don’t get ideas Murph.. you’re election year. good way get elected. problem Fauci's statements say actual triggers go back normal life. Lets KPIs trigger levels, transparency. whole ""just little longer"" thing unscientific knows it. Actually establish real metrics, track them, stick them. 

I'm fan Fauci, year - time step plate set real milestones. say can't allow others so. whole ""a weeks/months/whatever"" thing unhelpful. 

Say ""x deaths per week 7 day running average less would indicate need wear masks socially distance"". Say ""x percentage population vaccinated means xyz"". Whatever is, rest us sciences engineering set goals. I’m glad, grandfathers u.s. it’s vaccine received I'm Australia speaking position relative comfort, seem recall Austria well placed initial lockdown April May last year went wrong?
Friends mine originally Macedonia similar thing happened apparently, complacency set across Europe?  UK redditors comment Florida articles much UK articles. Boris bashed explicitly said he'd never this.

I know shit Florida situation comment it. Windows open + customer seller masked + quick buying = negligible risk spread. Oh love pretending something. negative test requirements last summer people coming high risk countries spreading restaurants bars?

Punish small business owner appear something. Yeah, typical politicians. /r/iamverysmart would say absolute bullshit drivel like look CDC's data, clearly rigged show schools ""safe"" beginning September effort push political message. 

The interpretation data also ""rigged"" way; stats say infections driven based contact tracing, Western countries debate going much community spread way trace infections sure specific source. allowed people say pretty much anything ""not known major source transmission"" one knew anything coming from. never used evidence things safe open, easy spin way interests reopening. reported misinformation everything post either blatant lie someone clue subject commenting it.There ""blatant fake"" official numbers, simply stopped publishing. numbers see World Data equivalents compiled activist group link government. reason believe fake actually, quite bad.

While, sadly, uptake bad prevalence anti vax conspiracies Russia, saying government making ""no serious effort"" pathetic. Unlike Europe, anyone wants get vaccine get less hassle free, even shopping malls football stadiums. Moscow, per last update, almost 8% total population receiving least dose. line european capitals which, vaccination slow, saying making ""no effort"" ridiculous.

There trials Venezuela Emirates. neighbourhoods Moscow? get vaccine stop complaining. really rural areas, though. Three top six counties respect number cases per 100,000 last 14 days Detroit metro area. And, five six counties Detroit metro area top 19. Michigan 83 counties.

Cases per 100,000, last 14 days:

1) St. Clair 154 - Detroit metro area

2) Sanilac 125

3) Huron 119

4) Tuscola 110

5) Macomb 109 - Detroit metro area

6) Lapeer 105 - Detroit metro area

7) Otsego 90

14) Shiawassee 73

15) Genesee 71 - Flint metro area

16) Crawford 69

17) Iosco 68

18) Wayne 67 - Detroit metro area

19) Oakland 64 - Detroit metro area school alone we've 130 cases even 600 kids showing class F2F vast majority working home. Anecdotal evidence. real evidence supports schools vectors transmission virus, one bothered actually study **fear political backlash.** It’s ones got vaccinated catching it. incorrect. lot states “reckless” reopenings stable case counts far Paywall, picture guy mask chinstrap knows he's photographed let everyone know going work out. What’s happening virus right South Africa completely irrelevant it’s treated big deal. 

The issue strain better able infect people vaccinated infection original strain. areas gotten outbreak original strain control may believe safe find outbreak South Africa strain nowhere enough people immune it. You’re ignoring whole killing people thing.

Proof measles vaccination required school, play sports. 

Of course killing people. It’s killing people now, it’s longer required. Magic.

Killing people kind whole fucking point. 550k plus. flu kills many people one year, means let’s check. probably one ill informed, laughable comments seen sub yet.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* poll numbers CDU freefall Söder probably CxU candidate popular (besides Merkel). Söder willing think he'll candidate. things reopened, saw malls FLOODED people. Like I've seen busiest Christmas black Friday boxing day sales, outdone days since born. Never saw parking lots full long remember.

I looked outside wondered mall parking lots deserted, remember going lockdown think it’ll interesting see vaccination rates vary parts country / certain states. It’s already becoming clear vaccine demand significantly slower rural parts state vs urban areas. ends justify means. excuse break ADA, demand know people's medical information, go full ""Papers, please."" I'm incredibly saddened seem learned nothing history. don’t think airlines either. International countries tons shit don’t agree with, whatever vaccinations travel US, really place say

Bars/restaurants/etc - talking community gathering spots. cannot discriminate people based medical status (including vaccination status) race sexual orientation sex. segregate community. People legitimate reasons get vaccinated like allergies, prevent participating life?

It boggles mind anyone thinks that’s appropriate. vaccines someone received none anyone’s damn business. medications take none damn business either Haha good fun. I'm Canadian can't really judge already starting see parts country yeah weeks going way pronounced reading correctly Michigan ~45 percent vaccine coverage 80+ anti vaccers annoying. pukes grow think going happen majority vaccinated COVID issue come, say August/September? I’m student April - October last year pretty alright. drop spring semester though since November I’ve wanted die. Literally don’t even care anymore. I’ve lost much confidence, hope, momentum. I’m counting days two weeks first shot go buy stuff person without massive anxiety spike. figure 80% plus double masks fine Hey genius, information whether someone certain vaccine part damn medical records. ROCKET SCIENCE! indefinitely. still spread others vaccinated. control unvaccinated folks wearing masks stores vaccinated folks don’t without requiring proof? 

And would store restaurant manage that? able delineate real vaccine cards fakes? already opposed providing ID travel that... 

imagine minimum worker Walmart trying enforce way? literally couldn’t enforce everyone none vaccinated? 

It’s common sense really. dad. 

Guy hasn’t left home town 20 years suddenly travelling wearing masks big deal know COVID-19 serious. I've following social distancing wearing masks even mandated area. change fact sucks.

Your glib comment appeared dismissive aloof. increasingly insensitive randomly say ""Pfft, miss people lol"" largely discussion psychological impact social distancing wearing masks, especially refuse demonstrate understanding impacts people. know teachers voluntarily working right? naive view world :) peaking April like last year. Ah yes, like lockdowns would limited weeks. preferred fences fucking fishnet stocking suspension bridge wearing now. yet, one guys Biden hand-picked lead Coronavirus Task Force.

He's alone, though, look rest: Slavitt, Ezekiel, CDC lady issuing ""imminent dooooom!"" news last week.

So guys Biden's ear. wonder he's pushing national covid passport program right get struck non-vaccinated people constitutionally protected group. Plus group cannot vaccinated, I'm sure Covid passport would exception you. Official CDC website News That's Fauci Neither vaccination card. doesn’t show certain disease not. shows vaccinated you’re protected others protected. 

Funny calling fool, yet believe vaccination card breaks medical confidentially. info id No, not. Agree disagree. Schools also allowed that. feel like treating remote learning live version person classes problem. districts announced using pre-recorded lectures, unions would lost shit. opinion Khan Academy? That's remote learning done students pause rewind things understand. also publish number [statistics impact using agree, everyone concerned vaccinated, get crazy unless think vaccines bullshit?

Does show impending doom horizon? No. variant!!!!!!!!! enough vaccinated vaccines don’t protect 100% time. still need mask distance awhile. States made reckless reopening decisions driving wave. also reduces severities pretty much completely still 0 reported deaths vaccinated individuals covid. trials also showed 74% protection asymptomatic also information asymptomatic infections J&amp;J trials included asymptomatic PCR testing antibody testing. (Participants tested antibodies part SARS-CoV-2 spike protein since vaccine would induce antibodies spike protein.) vaccine found 74 percent effective asymptomatic infection, similar protection symptomatic mRNA vaccine trials look asymptomatic infections, Gandhi thinks vaccines likely offer parallel protection symptomatic asymptomatic infections. “They didn’t kind testing, based real-world data vaccine roll-out, seems likely protection asymptomatic infection probably mirror protection symptomatic infection,” like watching bacteria mutate petri dish defeat what's designed kill it, large social scale.

I'm introverted person social anxiety problems mental health improved since covid happened. know why, maybe feel pressured go socialize? Lol Yeah, I’m west Michigan. don’t know exactly causing it. people blaming younger people causing it, possible guess. kids high school tested positive, bunch contact tracing, led finding many kids it. Kids school testing positive much higher rate county (Kent county). switched hybrid system instead full person. new cases occurring east side state. Hospitalization numbers still spiralling control,

ICU capacity Ontario higher ever entire pandemic. I've posted many times thread already. many people post obvious misinformation?  Covid got Moderna vaccine week felt pretty shitty past days (low grade fever fatigue). read couple articles recently 2nd dose might anything. See: 


I hear effects 2nd shot worse first would prefer go worse version need to. Think amend requirement next 28 days people Covid require 2nd dose? repercussions getting 2nd dose? pay money something comes free free vaccine catch federal charge time! wouldn’t say this. disheartening hear. Fully Vaccinated people able spend time capacity. I've loved spending last year home, definitely worse me. I've lost ability concentrate anything. places show get, don’t really experienced booking appt. ended Pfizer remember bombings like US. So, let get straight, chose protect others government didn’t provide mask? That’s dumb ass shit right there, boy. heard someone else come smart answer can't remember it. like health check. really annoying me. studies peer reviewed. Anyone literally write paper post rxivs. completely asinine. laughably full shit. comment made became thread (resulting gold actually!) resulted quite really crazy DMs abused kid im piece shit parent etc discussing concern

i followed one assholes found comment/thread got put r/shitpolitics say like 90 comments focused terrible parent def showed insane true colored madness antivaxx dumbass conspiracy nutjob Klan I'm both. loved hanging things friends also problem staying home. also loved experienced social anxiety year. things starting come back that's increasing lot practice long help. one thing may keep wearing bathroom cleaning chemicals I'm living proof this. I've thrived COVID. I've happier, doubled salary, feel better while. Sure, I'm opinion country going hell 90 percent population, whatever.

I'm wondering feel way things go back normal. what’s say don’t get mild moderate case knocks arse week? got flu years. work week felt like dying. 26 lol about: ""social credit score"" Hepatitis HPV 3 thought? you, doubt there's election coming big reason US succeeded rollout got president Biden hired competent people experience logistics. using federal resources like FEMA open super sites. getting people nurses doctors administer vaccine. Using National Guard military help out. last using pharmacies people really like administer vaccine. Biden administration really pushing pharmacies like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, grocery chains. Biden set goal within 3 weeks 17,000 40,000 pharmacies administer vaccine April 19th. like saying goes promise deliver. We'll see able get done. mean Biden set goal 100 million shots administered 100 days office done 58 days. he's wanting another goal another 100 million shots administered essentially 42 days. back March 19th announced it. good thing domestic production, one thing got proud Biden getting Mereck J&amp;J collaborate making J&amp;J vaccine. J&amp;J behind production Mereck helped close production gap crank vaccines normal. first time many months, confident get herd immunity adults July supply increases amount pharmacies increase administer vaccine. vaccinated mostly elderly far, they’re notorious dying sorts things.  got second shot pfizer today, waiting feel like shit im nervous person comes feeling well, going 7 hours double medical mask cloth mask topic? Literally president US prediction would end would amazing! seeing Trudeau hesitated long putting travel restrictions January, would really surprised used law. PM seem like drastic action, even case emergency.  love sports hate talking sports people it’s like time thing. hard finding adult friends interests like gaming RPGS taking guy trips fishing snowboarding hiking etc age 27 managed find dude worked best buy year younger went pickup video game dude nerd game like talked like 25 mins exchanged gamer tags know sounds like make love assure didn’t lmao started gaming together year half later solid bros interest talking sports gathering sports etc went comiccon kids met kid you’ll surprised random connections make step outside introverted comfort zone 70,000 actually doesnt mean 70,000 back Nov even weeks ago; lot less people infected compared past due infection/vaccination -- so, 70k actually attack ratet 130,000 back Nov think personal stories news articles facts?? read it, spammed us crap news remember judaism black people cause global pandemic killing millions maybe I'm super far liberal 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Zero covid might work isolated island nations population comparable size Louisiana could never work heavily populated heavily dense countries like US European nations. maybe societal acceptance wanting spend time home constantly going next event okay. 4th wave coming probably worst yet

Should trust random doom sayer reddit, trust stats, facts, literal experts matter.? information ability live surfaces? primarily concerned public transport riding elevators unmasked people. Obviously 1 dose better 0. take second secure it’s effectiveness. Otherwise need second shot, hm? badass name Good, screw extroverts Feel you. work industry that's also mostly sports, beer work talk also. last year new guy started started chatting working home found use RPG music background work music, love witcher LotRs, table top games etc. sports interest takes back seat important geeky topics. finally nice Co worker something talk with, pretty introverted someone wants talk fantasy RPG, I'm it. 

The first 6 months worked together would never guessed though. everyone else around us typical sports/work guy, geeky topics never came work assumed like rest cause better blending conversations. Working home working projects took us environment. VA lot people top food chain plan kinds things.

It almost always gets fucked somewhere planning execution Canada Emergencies Act Law, help lot achieve Zero COVID. special temporary measures ensure safety security national emergencies. considered provide, ""the stiffest government emergency powers emergency law Canada. work requires biweekly tests anyone onsite, provides them. which, herd immunity includes estimated 50% Californians already exposed virus. hope get vaccinated soon! article. 

Most cases Ontario confirmed B117. already linked data, ignored reason.

Furthermore multiple studies countries verified numbers. [There UK study replicating exact Exactly. Easier control borders. Also smaller geographically. say something, know something wrong. agree you.

However, important consider #1 goal lowering death toll things could re-open ASAP vaccinating elderly fastest way so.

To fully decrease cases told elderly keep isolating 3-6 months vaccinate young people (aka superspreaders) first. 

It would deeply unpopular measure tho even though one makes pragmatic sense. guy, god. They're islands, unlike mainland Canada. hope that's hinting at. Im introvert developed anxiety panic attacks pandemic idea didn’t lose income way life changed drastically -Im typically hermit crab anyway somewhere along road around September began panic attacks blue racing heart rate feeling like can’t breathe light headed feeling pass thought gotten corona bad like im ventilator bad ended diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder panic attacks. Last two months I’ve brought lot walking sunrise sunset reading clearing mind listing forest behind house shit debilitating I’ll driving store start high anxiety point turn around go home breathe paper bag start hyperventilating snowballing full blown panic attacks don’t lay count 200 breathe stomach turn noise. went 28 years without sort anxiety panic issue it’s common occurrence hope shit passes life returns normal.

As 5, however, attained antepenultimare level personal fulfillment. Wondrous creations marvels, far eye see!! lucky live family homebodies actually socially active one usually.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Honestly, way title phrased immediately thought actually talking effects pandemic. looks like 70,000 new known cases yesterday US. I'd probably feel comfortable visit place like Santa Monica pier we're 1,000 fewer consistently (and I'm fully vaccinated). knew lot people died this, I'm admittedly nervous. I'm also scared people think they're immune already infected. again, everyone different comfort levels. know going keep going get herd immunity. Yeah I'm probably honest. can't handle big groups all, couple close friends definetly enjoy it. Canadian, rules. Yeah would carry around though...maybe tactical football good know planning instead hoping magically disappears one day. Nice Todd Rokita (IN) worst. Even many Republicans hate he's far right. Absolutely shocked join in.  Go check bloomberg contrast, much East Asia including China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, well Atlantic Canada three northern territories, opted elimination — strategy used global fight smallpox measles.

For record Vietnam nearly 100mn people land borders three countries, China, Cambodia, Laos.

Speaking China, believe longest land borders country, bordering 16 separate countries.

So forgot disclaimer, could never work ""here"" (wherever you), due authoritarian, communist party name, what-have-you. know what? discriminating people choose get vaccinated. They're protected class. entirely choice deserve consequences. Congrats! Congrats! Lol sub hilarious Introvert person chronic illness here. 

My stress level gone way used zero sick days past year, due working home.

While would like able travel, I'm good things. told people consumed news like this? read headlines ads interspersed actual articles never click anything continuously scroll reading random snippets something strikes interest finally click one. people Reddit say we’re basically third world country! Knowridge sounds like engrish. There's narrative here. go centrist us know damn well previous administration made situation 1000x worse.

Never give credit conservatives anything . Agreed. Despite Redditors like think, ""introversion"" =/= ""social anxiety"". 

What Redditors like point think ""introversion"" means, accurate terms label ""introversion"" ""social anxiety"". sure I’m authoritarian...I stated I’m okay government creating database doesn’t vaccine, similar doesn’t drivers license.

I’m also okay large corporation fear damage brand, health risk customers employees say “hey, unvaccinated folks”. know, *just like public schools now* polio mumps vaccine. bit extroverted covid. Got sad. I’m bit introverted also sad. long benefits them. No, no, deal businesses operate way WANTS to. mine improved pretty significantly lol still might introvert, Redditors think (or see) introvert is. 

Most introverts definition introvert really actually socializes actually friends. also need time alone quiet environment recharge mentally. 

Redditors however tried (and I'd say succeeded) co-op word mean hermit, shut-in, misantrophic lifestyle unfortunately even accurate so. Probably justify lifestyle. better people going 10+ different individual sites drain available vaccinations, go 1 site drain available vaccinations?

i get argument is. appointments going get drained either way, using aggregator much better experience everyone. 

it's even remotely fun clicking pharmacies like ""interactive guides"" (because there's direct link scheduler) asking like 15 screener questions determine whether eligible get end see there's nothing available anyways. much small government... They're banned. Clearly troll posting bait. Thanks reporting it. basically one large country done better - UK. Lost mine year ago. living middle woods growing food stocking canned goods toilet paper. Lighthouse Labs, think it’s ten weeks now. Already making 100k, make way get hired American company. Fire asses won’t. Still 851 deaths day US (7 day rolling average, according Google). amount deaths 9/11 every 3 half days. Still seems pretty high me.

Hopefully another month two drop way down, though. Toronto yes. coding boot camp? long for? minimum amount really get enough begin career? thinking prior pandemic particular one looking closed down.

Is salary ok? Current job pays well enough lack true autonomy bothers end. Legit soon U.S. done Canada Mexico probably next list recieve U.S. vaccines wearing mine religiously year. Got 2nd shot early week. mask going back unless walk business requiring it. Also title wrong. There’s huge difference death excess death Jealousy? Please. It’s jab ENVY. There’s difference! 

Literacy now! mean , yeah . worked good . data checks . Tennessee, Missouri US bet big lot vaccines. What’s resistance masks? don’t mind wearing all. Lockdowns suck masks nothing. thought 161 million now. Kind of, lot ""introvert"" behavior talked comment threads extreme form ""social anxiety"" ""misantrophy"" actual introversion. 

Introverts shut-ins people live hermit lifestyles despite Redditors want believe. Introverts theory people socialize, need time away socializing quiet environment recharge.

Redditors hijacked true meaning ""introvert"" changed mean actually ""shut-in"" type lifestyle. Alabama, Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas confirm. working home since last April. There's rough periods sure, overall mental health 10X better. global perspective, US hasn’t strict measures even first months. Grocery stores open, hardest strikes restaurants bars open small tweaks offerings (to go, outside dining, etc.), people wandering around maskless parties/BBQs. airlines didn’t require masks fly empty seats passengers even peaks pandemic. 


The reason data inconclusive policies place areas teeth - weren’t enforced. mask mandates social gathering restrictions barely jurisdiction actually enforced fines penalties. massive cities America almost complexly open business since March 2020. 

It’s like saying it’s law speed never handing tickets wondering data shows people speeding. you’re free admit you’re full-fledged authoritarian, don’t use shitty, poorly-formulated rationalized “gotcha” arguments justify it. mean they're selling blank vaccine cards. hard make shit think genuine rather bots, comments similar things hear people Boston saying everyday (I work in-person social setting, unfortunately). fact even comments downvoted little weird. Brazil varient kicking ass. already send some? introvert extrovert like two extreme opposite ends spectrum?

what majority fall somewhere middle? Yeah exactly. Everyone breaking point. (and know probably get downvoted this) around late April 2020. like ""wait seriously going month so, fuck that"" pretty much stopped caring COVID. I’m fully vaccinated...not gonna wear one. I’m done.  country located in? Canada, would recommend coding boot camp. one four years ago, working industry ever since. Also 100% work home anywhere hell feel like it. I’m calling government *mandated* database, I’m fine government *managed* one private enterprise allowed they’d like. 

You’re quick freak “big govt” really think govt can’t access health care, tax, travel, purchase, etc. records? concern shouldn’t can, they’re abusing think be, that's basically reading tea leaves. one confidently predict course pandemic take. signs point towards ending soon, way empirically say will.

Scientists going scientists, people need stop expecting differently. Sorry, create another BS political narrative this. 

This rollout result work occurred across *several* administrations (predating Biden Trump), vast majority work done people working political positions. 

This rollout huge testament scientific community exists country world, well logistical capability US it’s allies. 

The idea Biden showed late Jan ‘21 made happen weeks reductionist stresses credulity. country located in? Canada, unfortunately, would sufficient land Junior position unless incredible connections coding projects beyond impressive (but getting people look presents even challenge). would recommend coding bootcamp. one four years ago, working industry ever since. agree 100% spend time daily thread. lot happy pretend none ever happened. Anecdotal, far friends, family, coworkers got Moderna symptoms following first shot. one know gotten symptoms Pfizer's first shot, odd they're roughly identical. people know least partially vaccinated. Don’t use disingenuous “free market” bullshit excuse justify you’re calling government-managed mandated database.

It’s free market company one making government access. think true first it’s point seems everybody absolutely fucking done covid ITT: People using term ""introvert"" talk actually social anxiety misanthrope. 

Being introvert shut-in living hermit lifestyle, means needing time recharge alone quiet environment, also time get together quiet setting friends nonetheless. 

Typical Reddit.

That said, pretty middle introvert extrovert scale, I'd say hate everything ""new normal"" except WFH. love WFH hope WFH continues on, least hybrid form. love fact get sleep owing lack commute office. love fact log 4:30 5:00 get extra hour live life owing commute office. really really dislike socializing co-workers well, also added bonus me. 

Now get called ""shut-in"" liking socialize co-workers, nothing common co-workers would prefer use time window socializing friends, aka people actually like socializing spending time with. WFH, especially normal times without restrictions, would make easier owing extra time brought commute home. 

That said, everything else ""new normal"" sucks. can't imagine lot people world, well outside Reddit, wants continue living home living ""restrictions"" life, wearing masks even pandemic ends (though kind get wearing public transit setting). donated lot money vaccine research covid, donated massive amount money towards children's education, staunch supporter gay rights civil rights general, generally voice reason segment world (country music american south) lot those. Agreed, people going things opening really bearing length this. knew start really two options; learn live COVID, wait till vaccines/herd immunity. anything, people going developing natural immunity help us reach herd immunity quicker (not way preferable vaccination, fact) Something something, hand free market, something something, unless doesn’t fit narrative That’s really comes to. months everyone wants vaccine ability get vaccine, it’s game over. 

The vaccine essentially free. point it’s them. nice say sorry can't hang covid know Extrovert here. person one year ago. short, irritable, unmotivated. crave time w/friends, happens, I’m quiet withdrawn. Wtf wrong me! Yeah, I'm good. much difference, honestly. 😀 one extroverts here, hate quarantine. stuck room alone depression horrible. least I'm public depression blocked fun It’s hard jealous given eager over. looking timelines now, it’s looking like Canada 2-3 months behind US herd immunity. isn’t bad considering 0 domestic production college, here's word day: empathy. 

A weeks ago, decided wildly unsafe people idiots acting were. Now, decided safe (or safe enough,) ready move on. 

That exactly felt weeks ago. Similarly, people feel way you. 

Look, want open much anyone, I'm also vaccinated, really need take pause understand world timeline everyone idiot ready pace are. I’ve sleeping better ever, first time life I’ve mostly good dreams instead nightmares, used dread going sleep look forward it! wrong. introvert feel pandemic embraced us greater good. wish world would stay like this😩 title article says nothing social distancing forever, article masks. Effective contagion prevention, effective sever case death prevention. type site might worked well point, way boomer internet savvy way gain competitive advantage boomers, doesn’t work anymore. Enough eligible people know it’s existence drain whole supply basically instantly. It’s much effective hit source (big pharmacy chains mostly, since vaccinations) new appointments drop. ""Life insurance application discounts"" financial meaning it. couldn’t even find article, pop ups even relevant? hopefully, want make metaphorical race, vaccine going win one.""

You ever hear wishful thinking? Hopefully scientific calculation. aspirational. 

I know Reddit want hear including mods sub...but guys idea hard variants going hit absolutely ready it. fact, welcoming Covid variants open arms. Everyone ignored Fauci said restrictions coming fast, pay price it. Again. 

It's really painful watch US make mistakes over, unfortunately exactly poised happen. ever normal Covid gone away still deadly waiting vaccne escape mutation  I'm introverted locked two amazing kids wife year. Love DEATH mood declined 😂. Setting good example would showing ok wear mask vaccinated. you. day 8 post Moderna shot #1.

Maybe even clear lockdowns work good harm. Compare data states US strict measures vs measures data inconclusive best, even skews favor states fewer restrictions. Zoom deleted glee many I'm sure! article literally talking forever. even read bro happened uncle, appointment mid January cancelled re-scheduled early March, due vaccine shortage Europe.

He contracted Covid weeks later died shortly end February.

It truly final insult think family ever forgive forget happened him. Canadian government page:

***Products affected***

*Face masks labelled containing graphene biomass graphene.*

&amp;#x200B;

So least know face mask state label, probably okay. think. literally news bruh fair point I'm productive right now, either. change fucked comment was. true, could go bars, restaurants, clubs, masks, social distancing throughout pandemic, wanted to. don’t know enough baseball, NFL people stadiums, NBA allowing people now. Also infection induced immunity isn’t good vaccine induced immunity leave people susceptible reinfection variants. People got sick died thought youth good enough protection, dismissed virus little flu. That’s pretty low risk scenario. 6 hours post pfizer 1... arm pretty sore that’s it! teared little bit getting shot emotional think nurse thought scared needles, lol  Nope, reporting issue, combined numbers front previous day going happen, something we're going get used to.

As said, vaccines 100 percent effective, really know anyone surprised when, know, prevent 100 percent infections.

Of course, diminish absolutely amazing vaccines, even 90 percent efficacy unreal. need stop surprised people get sick getting vaccinated. long stays within 90 95 percent efficacy range, there's nothing worry Lived Kawasaki City, wife Japanese. Japan humid. humidity levels comparable. since speaking climate humidity mentioned Japan. 

LOL entire household high risk virus fully vaccinated, would okay participate recreational sports, players might unmasked im unsure enforced rules are, however chance transmission ill wear mine, risk potentially around unmasked individuals know exactly you’re talking about. energy place vital extrovert, it’s least talked part personality. first time interacting people outside covid bubble rush dormant feelings. less social butterfly much social baby giraffe. almost much handle first wanting go know emotionally drained end also wanting miss memories friends making without go. love working home. hope continue working home going forward. realize everyone, modern open office terrible concept actually getting work done. reason cubicles can't come doors...In words, go away, I'm busy working, chit chat later. Nobody asking vaccine cards. There’s need one. Plus, there’s record given it, someone legit vaccine loses it? prove vaccinated? It’s like things going used proof ID carry anywhere. “reminder” vaccine got next appointment. ...the question manufacturers using it. Introvert here, confirm. crock shit commenting *the same* stuff place, spewing anger via hate towards ""extroverts"" - basically committing mental masturbation revenge fantasy, defines existence enough 'aight?

I'm antisocial, people skills time I'm asshole. Superior enough you? /s I’m happy perform particular security theater. security theater might encourage people aren’t vaccinated yet continue wear masks.  I’m going wear mask I’m vaccinated don’t want give unvaccinated asshole excuse wear his. I’m peer pressure, I’m happy appear exerting pressure people wear mask uneducated comment. mask shortage worldwide, made choice ignore mandate looking someone put blame on. deadly D614G variant? deadly Wuhan variant?

They're terms deadly are. yellow fever analogy too. never even affect people. laugh want concern raised privacy commision country human rights organisations. whole big important Supreme Court ruling? believe business someone, ok tell pound sand? apply certain cherry picked situations? Southern Europe problem. Basically they've trading sunshine widgets, work well pandemic. You’ve obviously never Japan you’re comparing climate Florida’s. LOL. I've reversed. first loved fact could spend weekend alone playing videogames watching films without feeling guilty social. time loneliness started creeping causing anxiety. Turns little bit social interactions work keeping afloat, even though I'd always thought could fine without people. people weird immune systems. rare. stopped taking mask mandates seriously became clear officials issuing interest making sure effective masks actually available public. Speaking personally mood improve entirely unrelated pandemic due personal changes made life left happier. met social needs playing weekly online D&amp;D group friends playing video games friends. think could meet social needs whether online means spending time person/people live impact lessened. absolutely enjoy getting hang person couple friends though! (in small group, big groups exhausting!) 


I think people extra time commute also gave time hobbies, exercise, cooking left healthier increased overall happiness. Likewise job open office socially draining job come home work mentally exhausted may enjoying break that. 


I'm little baffled people saying enjoyed free guilt saying social outings though. feel guilty tell someone no. someone tries guilt going social outing always politely tell fuck off, big deal. feel like responses bigger issues trouble drawing boundaries asserting themselves. ask introverts kids? enjoyed extra time them, distance learning, work, helping hardest thing I've ever done life. single, sure would one great long vacation noise. kids, one big ball chaos. Unsurprising.  time stuff ready won’t needed anymore. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Globally record 24 million vaccinations one day. statement would true months ago, would seem risks realised. Damage limitation point, disappointing trying claim anything else. Okay, let rephrase then: done combat Anti-Vaxxers still easily spread virus. agree invasion privacy ridiculous show proof go anywhere, it’s least better surge cases every five minutes. I’m trying say without breaking “no politics” rule, go easy me. Lol **""qr codes could beam location central server! -sent iPhone""** level discourse proof spreading pandemic now. wearing mask hes fully vaccinated? IIRC haven’t actually applied authorization waiting April, since didn’t production facilities ready anyway. Never good look city appears headline sub

Querdenkers again. embarrassment city science ordering groceries instead shopping fir myself, changed almost nothing life. wife great time relaxing home obligation go anywhere. What's rate long term effects young healthy people still experiencing? Also, bonus points, ignored seriousness situation, would chances ended mutating something less cool could posted? reasoning why? can't compare Covid-19 vaccines - r/noshitsherlock ?? mask compliance like brisbane 1 local case I’m looking post-vaccination email CVS seem put random doctor vaccine prescriber, mistake? assign random local doctor (since didn’t put scheduling appointment)? I'm sure got second dose Moderna vaccine 90 minutes ago, far feeling great! case, vaxinefinder.org shows ton openings pharmacies Bucks-Mount area right type. Yup! Like cancer. You’re getting downvotes you’re irrational. Nothing you’re saying agrees majority scientists’ claim matter. aren’t specialized field. got second dose Moderna vaccine 90 minutes ago, far feeling great! Tragically I'm talking 69.420% adult population overall population. We'll get there, think, eventually - happen much later - like June July. Definitely May. 

You correct states supply/demand imbalance, still puts limit number vaccines delivered. half state's population (e.g., South Georgia) ""done"", still means per capita uptake low average across state. 

The states listed (for part - possible exceptions e.g. Florida, maybe Alabama starting low base ""formally"" opened up) see material increases vaccination rates - many see material *declines* coming weeks. mean folks continue get vaccinated, pace definitely accelerate. 


This supply limited state looks like: demand limited state looks like: &lt;--- even Atlanta, historically blood red turning green. Part may Easter weekend effect - bunch appointments opened Friday afternoon yet filled. also think beginning inflection point even metro Atlanta. 


Obviously vaccine distribution private pharmacies (which vaccine spotter looks at), appointments readily available CVS, indication happening vaccination clinics. Feels good put immature people place, it?  graphene shed masks, gets lungs. nanoparticles cause damage. masks tested study result. many fucking times hear this... getting point anyone high risk able get vaccinated. feel sorry someone dies covid chose get vaccinated. Makes sense. less interact extroverts, better. wouldn’t happier I’m forced daily interactions people couldn’t read body language written much COVID-19 paying guy? varies. company requires people opt flu vaccine wear mask October-April That’s far case, going happen couple months US fully vaccinated.

Lmao, okay. Months ago window ""we prove vaccinations go daily lives"". window shifted """"yes will"".

How could possibly come conclusion permanent thing happens? variant fear-mongering mentions it'll endemic yearly boosters... Special kind crazy right there. point incredibly anal mask wearing considered anti-vax? full herd effect July 4th right

Wow hope works like this! know? introvert, speaks experience. lot anxiety think returning office. I’m productive home. Pretty much also. year need continue reopening moving society.

I lean left it’s getting point vote politician strong pro lockdown/restrictions even years covid... introvert, nice worry interacting people pointless small talk. Vaccine passports terrible terrible TERRIBLE idea. fact lot people seem favor really scary :( yet. likely case happen, probably isolated overhyped news. Well that, think going matter *will* asked press briefing. care they're antagonized, want get fucking vaccinated. Short literally naming shaming publicly, socially ostracizing may thing *actually* moves needle.

Dear antivaxxers - get shot stay home shame. going looking deaths exceeding 1000 day soon. absolutely idea talking about. can’t tell people lol snarky bother me?The government already tracking vaccinated, CDC info isn’t private. use smart phone, social media, passport file taxes. medical records, school records, employment records credit reports digitally stored various companies. Nothing really private anymore. Asking I’ve vaccinated seems non-invasive asking I’ve dental cleaning point. fairly likely originated UK, Kent specific. fact identified good thing vaccine development future. countries need genomic sequencing doubt variants could missedm was. lied expediency. streight shooter spitting us science. government liar. I'm talking PCR tests take 72h results. study done University super obvious? upgraded vaccine. get cookie already Windows 10! (Actually picked Panda Express way home lol) mRNA sequence exactly Pfizer. They're exceptionally similar vaccines. Lmfao, happening. maybe I'm posting narrow topic opinions one subject define entire existence. 

But go ahead think superior. Idiots know stupid. Yeah imagine United States health safety requirements?

They'd end sorts acronym agencies regulating everything water quality number insect body parts allowed peanut butter. end? Soon may even force companies compliant Americans Disabilities. sure new, important overreach must fret about. care cases anymore...  wondering thing, I'm pretty sure he's going either backtrack conveniently forget it. think he's even mentioned commitment since around January. subreddit, assured phrase ""masks work"" said keep protective equipment doctors. Yeah article saw today screaming variants, people comments sections saying wouldn’t change behavior post vaccine need continue hUnKeR dOwN. Give rest already know gotten blood clot Covid? known possible symptom. possible immune system would reacted covid leading blood clot vaccine did. Even number blood clots, total number vaccinated particular vaccine, math speaks itself. far likely get I'll die Covid vaccine. Well, limits, forced social interaction actually increased due forced meetings last month point got much. Actually, know actually enjoy 4 hours social interaction per week, definitely enjoy 6 hours more.

Before covid, like per month everyone department like 30 minutes per week average ""randomly"", five (remote) meetings per week discuss ""anything"", i.e. can't even really plan it. Agreed, hoping area would get 70% people getting vaccinated area. 35-40% around now. Yeah I'd say opposite me. finally felt like could go feel like stared followed anything. cars road silence time. God miss early pandemic  point? asked overreacting. downvotes comments determined were. want answer ask question.

if wanna productive might covid study near looking people live household covid + person. boss made 5k. sound bad you. I'm getting mine tomorrow, work home pre-emptively took Monday morning told boss I'd check needed afternoon too. Hoping I'll feel good enough go exercise class Monday night sure. that's true whatsoever. Young people absolutely risk COVID. risk dying low, 0. also risks developing long COVID. importantly young people carriers kill older people. know right organization planning mandating vaccine unless required state/federal compliance. plan action based discussions we’ve leading competitors industry similar plans. main concern staffing surveys showing might lose 15-20 percent certified employees vaccine becomes mandatory. cant wait inevitable lockdowns coming back! pronounced colonel highest rank military. Well fuck. sounds like highly likely hypothesis. question combat this? I'm even OK that, long us constant allergies required mask 24/7/365 about. realize *doctor* medical information *local grocery store* medical information two totally different things sure you’re downvoted, it’s unfortunate case past year. went school years ago sick varying severity colds entirety first semester. finally got better probably got warmer, also probably already caught everything caught. one likes lock downs. simply understand fuck needs get pandemics without letting millions people die. sociopath ability comprehend that. Sociopaths reason still dealing shit long willingness spread it. Okay, try woman who's like that, [orthostatic meaning standing talking people parties something do. POTS comes sound-triggered migraines, really party-compatible (or, matter, kid-compatible). Religion protected charateristic. 

Businesses cant discriminate said characteristics. 

Religion also matter choice. change religion second. Cant change sexuality race. Getting vaccine also matter choice. decide get vaccine second want didnt want before. 

Again, businesses cant ban choice religion, shouldnt able ban choice vaccine. 

Really, protected classes shouldnt actually exist businesses private entities perfectly legal bar anyone reason business property. Current rules England state: 

Communal worship, including prayers, devotions meditations led Minister Religion lay person
Limits communal worship decided basis capacity place worship following assessment risk.

Possibly service hadn’t done risk assessment (they claim had), Police enforcing guidance law people glom onto ""not 100%"" shame us ready act like vaccine works. feel like I'm tight middle mood pretty constant. college, used get wicked hammered. nickname ""Puke."" would chug fifth So-Co, sneak frat party, polish people's empties, brewskies, Jell-O shots, body shots myself, pass out, wake next morning, boot, rally, So-Co, head class. Probably would gotten expelled I'd let affect grades, aced courses. called ""Ace."" totally awesome. got straight B's. called ""Buzz."" perhaps needs law regards pandemics. Clearly far many people feel entitled spread deadly virus others kill them. I'm expert, feel like temperature would sterilise surfaces viruses would also serious damage lungs. like it, I'm hoping students able even get shots time. irrelevant. Main factor loneliness - people lonely, sense belonging feel sad. take mine online Athabasca University. boot camp don’t learn typed languages touches object oriented programming principals (plus hell lot missing it’s 10 weeks vs 4ish years study). work Java courses pace; might eventually whole degree, take long time. now, I’m level better better programmer, mentor, technical lead. oddly little side effects either Pfizer 1 2. heard several people, really seems like random chance whether vaccines make given person sick. I'm curious dashboards checking. We've seen yet another surge area. read words headlines replace rest whatever fit fantasy  studies done, seems like people ignoring timing everything really sucked. Last March much looking forward getting house enjoying life winter cold miserable. Car shows, concerts, bike nights, air shows, bar patios, baseball games...it going great! happen. Instead feel like I've winter mode since October 2019. Dude, come on........ Wearing mask hard acknowledge trade-offs universal masking? Extremely reasonable, it’s problem people discount studies favor narrative consider correct, Israel, Pfizer, CDC said citing studies vaccines prevent spread. I’m whatever needs done stop spread, I’m vaccinated even, time go back normal wear mask, it’s time go back normal. would jealous 3 times less deaths per capita US. currently tearing Brazil getting started BC. Inevitably rest country going make January numbers look tiny comparison, current vaccines struggle kills 20-50 year olds.

if look pandemic waves Spanish Flu exactly thing happened.

We learned nothing. Cases rising area. People ignoring state-wide mask mandates, since beginning. ""Patriot Parade"" scheduled trucks Trump flags. media trying warn people. know live, speak US. Makes sense. might miss covid days get back office socialize again. get downvoted cause reddit super left leaning nothing wrong waiting time taking Introvert can’t wait go cafes, restaurants, theaters alone me-time. love family, sheltering year drained soul.   Ah fair fair That's they're looking vaccine passports avoid this, dimwitted governer actively blocking this. seems study article referencing: welcome provide data supports that. mortality data year available months. preliminary numbers suggest United States track see 3.2 million deaths year, least 400,000 2019.  CDC counted 2,854,838 U.S. deaths \[in 2019\], nearly 16,000 2018. That’s fairly good news: Deaths usually rise 20,000 50,000 year, mainly due nation’s aging, growing, population.  feel you. occasionally irrationally hate things. Exactly, stress level dropped much get exhausted telling people no. medically fragile child added extra layer people asking stuff understanding, outside covid barely tell whole family flu inviting us over. I'm actually ok part stay home, dislike rest stuff that's going covid. going ""lose control"" population keep up. Lockdowns worse disease case. Oof. Hope vaccines come way soon Umm covid essentially harmless younger people, that’s going happen Yes things pretty well normal groups vaccinated individuals. I'm right here, papi. It’s literally thing It’s likely it’s courtesy others thing fear thing pronounced colonel highest rank military. Anything hands would seem completely wrong online learning. suppose could discuss certain amount book/paperwork stuff, could replace actually doing? Doesn’t matter. Online classes still thing another year atleast That's Canada ship south elderly. Faster vaccinated everyone worldwide quicker hopefully slow even rid world Covid19. Doesn’t matter. Online classes still thing another year atleast actually don’t know. Maybe doesn’t seem natural intuitive say, it’s annoying hear everyone repeat something they’ve heard elsewhere. can’t help cringe truly don’t know Everything else aside: oh God, FUCK admins. boyfriend rest professor university teaching 2 classes semester professors elsewhere, asked teach one free charge semester one year due budget issues. directly caused bad admin decisions. professors tried stop, tried provide alternate solutions for. 

Public school teachers state got bonus, they're literally making much associate professors university, teaching extra classes free. president bloated admin staff wasting endless dollars failing basic shit like *ordering professor's departmental supplies fall semester NOVEMBER.*

Bloated, overpaid admin damn cancer. cannot wait till general public realizes this. Cushy professor jobs thing most; that's first budget cuts fall. That's many adjuncts exist. 

I know it'll take admin start culling themselves, needs happen SOON. dollars take professor salaries facilities budgets, plus extra student debt gets incurred... unconscionable. also doesn’t known allergens, eggs. Wow alot unpack missing point vaccine. 

Example Scenario: hospice home seniors last days/months lives. You, jewish person, person color three parents community. jewish person going kill residents judaism, care bar entry. person color going kill residents simply color skin, need bar either. 

But come protected disease shown kill residents large numbers, could seen carrier? ... Yea, I'd bar you. 

To use logic you, getting vaccine choice yes, business owner get choose bar someone poses safety risk customers. CHOOSE go business accept risk. talking vaccine considered experimental today, administered Emergency Use Authorization. lot people would like give field trials time taking it.

We also talking government conducted Tuskegee experiments. lot people simply trust whole process. Totally! sure like yet, take free courses part-time intro course costs way less don’t need quit job for. 

For me, best thing ever did! national level, you’re right, roughly half states lower infection rates provinces; cases, gap quite large. Notably, current infection rates BC Ontario exceed Texas. current infection rate US heavily skewed Michigan, New York, couple states.

Testing rates Canada always somewhat lower US well; actual number cases Canada probably higher reported. This. I'm big time introverted mental health WRECKED isolation. Aced classes, called Ace *So what?* literally last week even evidence needed vaccines prevent spread. I've seeing ""I'm vaccinated I'm gonna let pandemic ruin life anymore"" dude bros *months* now. wearing mask makes people around (who know whether vaccinated) comfortable, burden accommodate that? piece cloth. People subreddit seem invented mystical public health expert wants us locked houses wearing hazmat suit next 10 years. Wow sound like asshole I’m seeing places say fuck take walk ins. Good sign ask me. places. Like Chicago. One friends drove like 3 hours secure first Pfizer dose.  what’s problem phrase? I’ve seen like three people complain today true statement Messianic Jews thing... Time forgery 😎 Christians, mostly Arab Christians live Israel celebrate it. Depends month calendar flipped to. Mine still showing January. Good. Canada mostly un-vaccinated feeling full brunt third wave now. whoa wth. could link us? need good laugh deflection pure simple. Someone somewhere made decision get kids back school....you celebrating afterwards (which honestly that?) cheap attempt turning blame. pfizer me. hardly ever get sick ava hoping escaped it. Got 8am Thursday sore arm fine went sleep. time woke Friday feeling terrible. Still 100% yet, much better.

Still worth it. Introvert here. great, it’s also great procrastinator me. stay home relax, also dread homework that’s due tomorrow. pretty much, way better dealing two things *and* taking people. Last summer everything open life felt normal Scum like reinforces belief torture option punishment, teach lesson. u definitely weren’t hostile!

Just wanted add context! ‘Let's think sec, Iowa_Hawkeye, would somebody put guarantee box? Hmmm, interesting. Here's way see it, Guy puts fancy guarantee box 'cause wants fell warm toasty inside.’

Iowa: ‘Yeah, makes man feel good inside.’

‘Course does. it? Ya figure put little box pillow night, Guarantee Fairy might come leave quarter, right? point is, know fairy crazy glue sniffer? ""Building model airplanes"" says little fairy, well, we're buying it. sneaks house once, that's takes. next thing know, there's money missing dresser daughter's knocked up, seen hundred times.’

Iowa: ‘But put guarantee box?’

‘Because know sold ya guaranteed piece shit. That's is, it? Hey, want take dump box mark guaranteed, will. got spare time. now, customer's sake, daughter's sake, ya might wanna think buying quality product me.’ feel like I'm bit both. loved start peace see world stop spinning were.. starting feel suffocated can't wait something resembles normalcy society. This. prefer plenty time myself, get occasional social interaction become depressed. definitely go lower frequency friends, still important part life. difficult thing dating, that's taken toll motivation. seeing many people coming pneumonias hospital COVID scarring lungs decreased lung capacity. Great see India picking pace. Dreaming visiting Goa year’s end. Hopefully they’ll disease mostly eradicated then. found less introverted thought. biggest issue seeing stuff over. started feel claustrophobic. Masks way people wear - loose fitting mass poor materials - help little bit, stop anything. slow marginally.

Vaccination much much much much stronger. Massive distrust government urban centers... Combined school age kids (and parents) getting tired lockdowns traveling, going parties friends, etc... adding michigan testing students rate much higher state. Student athletes example mandatory testing minimum 1/week. one know surprised surge cases. science show that. published. vaccine works. knows works. scientists pretending stupid people get vaccinated say hey look guys vaccine works! got vaccine literally president, lmao Yes “it reduces chance contracting covid 95%” simplest way phrase this? “Into arms” — can’t see say administered? Also what's Easter eggs bunnies? I'm starting suspect Easter Jesus...  interesting parts communications: soon realized language needed use social media different language use colleagues, students, patients. people already know trust me. social media users necessarily trust you. convincing use different language. group scientists ask whether caused vaccination, would reply currently proof vaccines cause autism, correct. say uneducated audience, say vaccines cause autism scientists know enough proof. careful say.  case, form substance. years we've seen changes modes communication: first printing press, radio, television. social media, important formation public opinion. discuss infectious disease, public opinion important people change behavior, get vaccines, they're going lose infectious disease...  regard convincing people social media — personal opinion — believe small percentage people never convinced. completely irrational. science rational arguments, impossible convince them. people numerous; recent elections, gained 0.7%-0.8% votes. places particularly active, vaccination rates dropped 20% — less 1% might expect — frighten people. mentions nothing giving money schools person learning cases spreading schools though. Lift rug, sweep. say that. One reasons really like 3M respirators 7093 P100 box filters pressing outside filter housing actually seals filter, easily fit check anytime want (press filters, inhale, see mask sucks stays). rig exhaust filter, also mind people giving odd looks sometimes. need hit herd immunity 80% life go back normal. sooner hit sooner get go stores without masks go back concerts. need everyone participate get vaccine protect either can’t get yet (children) unable get vaccines immune compromised. Herd immunity beat covid. I’ve never flu vaccine flu Yeah, cause that's definitely thing preventing someone getting deadly disease.

Thanks responding know block, though. way never read crap again. studying lot things decades. things centuries still haven’t solved them.

What point? ten year old genius college already? Ok? also required basic human functioning like getting education. OPTIONAL Sounds good, I’m gonna require employees get tubes tied. one forced it. article NZ beating Covid, success allowed us trace every single case get learn virus spreads, providing new info WHO, though listening. maks getting wet sticky 20 minutes, thne either mask really bad, basically spitting it. I've worn masks 5 days week least 7 hours time, never gotten wet sticky. someone trusts way authority would help here, that's 100% guaranteed. big Vietnamese celebrity doctor/educator helping bust theories? sounds dumb, know, sort thing really help, there's nobody knows irl. realize things wildly different histories? One actually history would rollout finished Fall? get it, can't use Sanofi? J&amp;J single dose vaccine ramps production might work better end.   can’t believe you’re voted bubble boy disease? Cries European. That’s understanding well. body would drastically diminished warmed air time hits lungs, nasal cavities even. Yes
 big deal lot people. everybody same


Shocker. fucking joke unfortunately society many people absolutely getting whole day movement. agree overeating since lockdowns made outdoor stuff safe everything else i'd wager people spending time outside less Yeah European countries consider island middle nowhere could avoided whole mess.

They entire month's start one Europe handling this, could easily manage incoming arrivals none arrive road, economy rely lots lots people entering leaving country.

They great job, let's pretend Jacinda Ardren Italian PM they'd COVID free Dorms sound like bad idea general Got mine today too! Like every Hollywood movie probably shifting production New Zealand Indiana, home dip shit Pence, give fuck anyone obviously. average IQ low end. thing common give &amp; say "" can't anything difficult""  pretty much whatever I’d like point? Wow exact situation well. Lmao flu vaccine new specific vaccine. Thank bummer. wonder J&amp;J vaccine rare non-zero vector PF4 cross reactivity know yet. clear AZ rarely causing clots vector PF4 cross-reactivity plausible mechanism think . America, totally fucked brink immorally violent dissolution, somehow crafts historically redemptive moment science driven human advancement.

Again.


Goddamit. It’s absolutely meaningless since they’re allowing religious exemptions. Anyone doesn’t want get vaccinated claim religious exemption come right in. pretty much ONE actually *likes* wearing masks. Even fervent pro-maskers know 2020 saying fucking *hated* it, going along method time.

It's easy see many would flip upon reaching full immunization 2 weeks final dose. Hell, reason I'm still wearing one public get harassed wearing one going various establishments. went Texas Georgia right now, wear one, though I'd probably 14-day quarantine upon returning home chance one ""got infected whilst fully vaccinated"" people. Personally, friends made one big discord server bunch channels voice chat practically daily, super fun. thats ive keepin touch friends Yeah really simple. 1 hour jogging outside definitely replace whole day movement stress anxiety definitley lead overeating Hope game worth it. Indeed.

A 40C fever already considered dangerous cannot imagine plan combat covid steam. is, pharmacies going sitting vaccines 2 weeks time near future. I’ll fucking protest lol. I’ve home past two semesters didn’t want treated like prisoner college. continue measures fall people better complain. neocon cant use word braindead anything else himself. know. Agreed. Unfortunately mandatory military. Even then, risk college students equal flu. whole purpose protecting students Covid prevent spreading grandma right? think would absurd continue authoritarian coronavirus measures fall anybody wants vaccine get one. First dose Moderna here, 30 hours later sore arm felt little tired took short nap, symptoms.  remember getting downvoted oblivion responding Australian making fun American deaths. Basically said ""show respect dead people betrayed incompetent government."" Got piled Australians New Zealanders gloating perfect societies.

Well, hope enjoy living island prisons hope travel, going full city lockdowns every time quarantined person sneezes, rest world moves lives.

It could 2 years they're vaccinated, point they'll need booster shots variants, whole cycle start again. Who's incompetent now? mean, make hundred dollar bills specific markings magnetic strips verify real, vaccine cards? someone lived Ithaca, law suit threats hilarious. 20 year old kids law school think know everything threaten sue anything. worse yet, entitled lawyer parents threaten sue to. good. dont need it. nobody wants blood clots anyways part group! course 4 million seems many us were. Brazil, ICUs getting lot healthy young people in, it’s hard believe. Many thanks colleagues! keep head sand dude answer question possibly yes. several companies working 'universal' flu vaccine, several stage 3 trials, pandemic hit. switched working Coronavirus vaccines. 

So soon go back working flu vaccine, maybe one soon. Hmm thought 2 weeks expiration without deep freeze, last checked- let look again. family member got tested government Tuskegee experiments? exemptions there? That's one given today TX! say I'm extrovert, long shot. overall, things mostly fine around July. Online school really ruined me. already issues finding motivation things yelled constantly tackle ever growing pile work already little motivation clearly help. Eventually breakdowns became common, point last one Friday.


Also I'm even really sappy person recently I've wanting someone hold me, feel warmth another human being. I'm tired alone, physically emotionally. 2.8 million vs 3.3 million totally off. obviously 500,000 completely healthy people rest lives ages ahead though headline that's meaningless without context. Many, many people care homes so, whole make 'fine', different 500,000 people dying natural disaster etc. Context key, using academic referential manner, fine. 

It's people use pejoratives heavy xenophobic slant on.

Got racist relatives who've said messed things surrounding South African variant. Unfortunately people like world. familiar study. outlier, it' sin vitro. support claim vaccines work P1. Also paper shows B.1351 much worse P1 know Pfizer, Novavax J&amp;J work (Novavax less others) Considering black people largely distrust government vaccines Tuskegee experiments, would expect college requires vaccines prepared mostly turn people color. friends work public health outreach. strong vaccine hesitation black communities. Even people working outreach black vaccine. think fully understand meant that. That's issue. ignoring socioeconomic impact people becoming homeless, sent poverty, can't work due restrictions focusing simply covid cases/deaths alongside mental health issues.

It's easy say ""just trust Fauci"" roll eyes middle class redditor WFH/employed entire pandemic postmating meals vs someone lost job/severely reduced paychecks/ hardship due restrictions. This! fact see clearly bad data managed state (they keep “finding” backlogs) deaths far backdated (over 30 days point) looking anything state provides pointless... wrong, sad reasons everyone else wearing mask. deep freeze requirement dropped weeks ago, it?  Yeah US never respond countries call, stockpile available vaccines without sharing supply outstripping demand May 1st means everyone wants one able get 1st dose end May. Add another 2\~3 months time schedule appointment complete cycle 1st shot 4 weeks 2nd shot 2 weeks maximum immunity, everyone wants vaccinated done later end August.

By point, lift restrictions anti-vaxxers own. Mexico already America. Unfortunately true :'( Sort of. Cornell grad I’d love claim Fauci alum technically went Cornell medical school. medical school NYC, 3 hrs away “Cornell University,” upstate NY. point though, article implies medical school also requiring vaccinations. Yep, guy who's hard hearing relies reading lips communicate *really* selfish. 

Maybe think maybe self-righteous jerk, know.  feel like could done better job cards make hard forge them. seal like ones notaries, blacklight stamp, something. whole year prepare this. link cell.com article tweet stream Im exactly sure mean might relevant. Sounds desperate. done didn’t want take hours someone might need since 9-5 WFH. wouldn’t miserable. cried today thought might get meet friend drinks. Like flaked would KMS. didn’t end flaking actually went taproom near house hadn’t ever talked people! I’ll go like see happens. pronounced Cornell way. None friend's companies have. COVID, feel effects second shot getting 1st, 2cond shot usually little effect increased immunity general feeling get. lol I'll bite. uncommon get covid once. heard expression ""don't let perfect enemy good"", right? Masks perfect shown help lot.

I would encourage read bit anecdotal evidence can't make decisions it. Cornell strange spot, since partially public partially private. far understand it, countries track average annual death rate expect slight +/- adjustment year, anything higher slight increase would classed excess death, i.e. excess projected Cool.  first doses combined? Yes... main Wuhan bat lady said scientific American article could smell guano Mojiang mine... tells everything.... you’re supposed smelling you’re protected. Great news helps explain deaths continue decline Canada despite cases increasing. 

Showing size supply - use it! Decades ago, pneumonia college finals week option miss / retake final communications class (boy would fly WHAT?!). So, remember going final unfortunately coughed repeatedly loudly - yes, covered mouth - apologized one. never finished test quickly life. 

Got B. Truuue labs, didn’t think science departments them. can’t wait buy Ding Dong’s protective underwear wearing one close proximity someone tested positive next day. completely fine. thinks it’s important buy reputable brands publish lab results filtration. Social media mistake. Well, similar root worries. people get vaccine passports? level access getting be? sort barrier entry exists?

For example:

* app? available every OS? app, means smartphone would likely required. everyone afford plan easily.
* vaccination card? happens lose it? go replace it? need provide medical records? get those? Remember, everyone PCP. 
* like government ID? know struggles many people faced getting IDs. fact, localities make harder get IDs based sites open location. put big ol factory somewhere Alberta make sense you? New York's biggest wave, barely testing 10,000 people per day across entire US cases per capita useless comparison states waves early vs late pandemic. point rhetoric rationale policy Read post achieve worse results states use destroying economy? NY see vaccine they're offering state sites sign up. Vaccinefinder.org also tells vaccine stock location. got work home full time, less interaction everybody general.

I well truly loved life last year..
Something I've rarely able say prior it. Rome, they're not. Never heard say this......always could still get pass someone.....  Thanks bebe :* big gamer introvert, loved covid. League legends, running, whatever else wanted day, every day, without dealing toxic people don’t like. got first two days ago! walked big smile Fauci triple mask heart desires. get vaccine mask goes trash can. crappy little piece card given got vaccinated guarantee already forged thousands right now. NJ Gov Murphy presented DOH models daily briefing last week. posts Facebook saw there. Tell follow system booking new appointment CVS: CVS drops new appointments 4am-6am (and midnight 2am) basically every day except Sunday

Tip: ""select state page"" booked, click state hit 'schedule appointment.' (I like use mississippi, always appointments available). Follow directions asked put zip code. Put correct zip code wait exactly midnight hit enter. Quickly select location time first dose.

CVS holds appointment 30 minutes input info schedule second dose (they always place).

I've used method 3 times schedule appointments people worked like charm time. appointments offered usually 4 5 days out, tonight first dose would probably Wednesday Thursday. let businesses discriminate blacks? ""Significantly cut on"" ≠ ""Stop"". agree important combat misinformation. Please make sure argument factual accuse others deviating facts. would comparison alternative, larger numbers people suddenly spreading virus again. remaining unvaccinated would much greater risk, would sure result number deaths happen No. even close true. absolutely guarantee need boosters. original comment said people copy behavior see people wearing masks. 

I provided counter example using personal experience, explained reasoning blindly copying people.

It’s bad don’t like it. feel bad saying this, im looking forward normal. People annoy covid reinforced that. People area never stopped partying they're bars without masks now. Sure , realize many many people qualify right now. qualify 2 weeks month, got fully vaccinated 2 months. wife extroverted I'm introverted. caught covid still. Yes, go way did. people didn’t intend harm didn’t mean harm doesn’t mean didn’t harm. Well intentioned people unknowingly harm others time. Covid vaccination one way happens. I’m blaming didn’t know better really needs transparency organization prevent happening going forward. Cool, speed canada plz?  arm sore times way first time. Second shot woke next morning feeling like hangover, gone within 24 hours. nearly bad expected hearing ""I 3 days second shot"" stories heard people. Why? tell me. Statistically, covid dangerous children seasonal influenza may actually less dangerous. risk-benefit analysis comes vaccinating children different adults, especially older adults. Yeah division nastiness brought people stressful Thanks! Getting first dose vaccine one happiest days life! able get early co-worker knows someone works clinic extras. Honestly, talking about? People copy people, nobody wear masks? Rambling ethics response point made people's behaviour shaped people around you?

Can not, please? lockdown flu, perhaps near-extinction flu pandemic make us consider somewhat harder stance towards future. least, culture working sick needs change (and perhaps already has). People trying desperately get vaccine failing consider actions affect others. White people driven marginalized communities temper tantrums told vaccines residents certain zip codes, failing consider people zip codes don’t car gas money need vaccine close home can’t go driving town. Also people color America likely work essential jobs exposed covid white Americans. I’ll downvoted way Antarctica you’re right want know someone sees What's mixed? CDC ever message vaccinated wear mask anymore? Didn’t parents risk lives WW2? you’re scared flu? pushy? Didn’t parents risk lives WW2? you’re scared flu? pushy? like idea ANYONE (business, government, mother-in-law, etc.) demanding see health data precondition providing access service

Imagine transgender People need get vaccine. drastic reduction transmission. know asymptomatic infection reduced 85-94 percent viral load likely reduced breakthrough cases significantly. Making far less likely vaccinated people spread virus. given still non zero chance we’ve hits high vaccine threshold mask mandates continue. I’d say around June July mask mandates end see drastic reduction transmission rate high vaccination rate. Basically everyone opportunity fully vaccinated shouldn’t continue masking. Yep, town pretty much Pfizer. think it’s pretty much entirely random.  state appointment scheduling system shows vaccine location gives. picked one (about 45 min drive vs 30 min) order get Pfizer.  Public health crisis. There’s many hours day, every day counts. Plus plenty non-religious non-Christian medical professionals Let's stay topic. What's rate long term effects young healthy people experiencing? Huh? afraid of? We're Canada using guys model. Glad see working well. Yeah felt too. saw number day got mine like “I one vaccinated”. confirm! Introvert getting quite depressed wake go school everyday, place hated still hates homeschool happened got sit home alone amazing family relax fun! also got talk friends discord play games like Minecraft together classes grades improved massively since mood also got better! point it’s obvious COVID vaccines aren’t plot harm anyone, made trials, got authorization emergency use, distributed widely demographics except youngest, Tuskegee experiment even relevant? obvious parallels here. It’s conspiratorial thinking. Give exception. Yeah it’s two weeks first dose, I’m going crazy, fact substantially protected give peace mind.

Second dose Thursday. Super excited it, even though I’ll feel like crap day two 😂 Pfizer higher outright efficacy, it’s important give health social care workers don’t pass virus on. elderly, vaccines stop deaths 100% given alternative True. murder even illegal? thing ethics framework determining actions/behaviors right wrong. saying, people’s behaviors shouldn’t determined based everyone else does. determined based system ethics. short, it’s called right thing. That’s live life.

If people make decisions based everyone else does, dangerous - historically, lead atrocities. sure used to. Canada helped develop manufacture polio vaccine 50's. problem sold 80's. 

Canada great research great development. pandemic least likely spur domestic manufacturing caught pants next time. I'm seen uptick spam phishing e-mails, bad year ago. Kids spreading new variants. People need wake up.


They wore masks practiced social distancing, 9-year-old daughter caught virus showing symptoms one day school.

""We wearing masks everywhere,"" Armando said time. eggs 😂 Let's stay topic. What's rate long term effects young healthy people experiencing? Bloomberg says we’re averaging 3 million doses afraid happening people “fuck up”? people'll fake get events DeSantis fucks FL again. least I'll vaccinated idiots. thing happened (sore 1st time, 2nd). Hopefully we're good.  Many do. Fauci 100% right statement. probably need fully vaccinated, science show *yet*. Therefore, correct say said. always thought introvert became sahm one talk to. bunch vaccinated people stop wearing masks bunch unvaccinated people well. I’m discussion debate, pretty damn obvious. That’s totally prerogative I'm introvert tried kill three months ago idk that. article says masks labeled containing graphine. looks like applied masks question antiviral agent. I’m guessing it’s combination mRNA (which sounds scary non-scientific people) one dose unvaccinated people spread variants might evade current vaccines.  Ok maybe change behaviour personally, still think plenty people will/woul

Also talking ethics here, people's general behaviour. spout whatever want ""groupthink"" change people's behaviour could done UK did. Build domestic production. That's helping UK. US still tens millions doses making daily could let go yesterday? I'm Juan million. Scared? say that. Would like avoid COVID? Yes, that's relatively effortless family.

You asked question, know I'm afraid of? I'm afraid fragile mentally unstable zoomers accept reality, disregard opinions advice health professionals either think know better, want pretend know better, can't deal what's happening. think people going fuck us, especially we're close.

But let's go way back original question, refused answer. What's rate long term effects young healthy people experiencing? mask mandates end 50% people vaccinated, claiming? Who's awesome? awesome! Beating thing =/= beat thing Yeah everyone know went unvaccinated vaccinated (one dose) past month. get second dose Thursday. Canada domestic manufacturing anyway? Surely there’s enough brain power draw places like Vancouver Toronto? sort job this? Programming? Math likely wrong 215 million people US age 18. May-Mid May 200 million fully vaccinated? would 93% adults fully vaccinated? distribution vaccines Wisconsin Minnesota probably one mind-boggling things I've seen. makes sense send doses per capita slow several states sitting 1M vaccines... Whew, nbd then. Let's go back time nothing response virus. Okay, happens people can't get vaccine allergies health condition?  help everyone mama making newest craze post certified vaccine slips? advised doctor suffering 2 months hospitalised said nothing could prescribe enough known aftereffects know helps. 4 months later much better getting vaccine still suffer multiple symptoms, hope help coming soon report hasten help. father? Nard Man. Simple things, huh. Really? Dude I’m making damn joke lmao. I’m well aware rationing, etc. Christ 😂 ""Netflix DoorDash forever!"" Infusion nurse here. get paid stab people day. really random happens even someone phobia needles. Totally pulling experienced guessing, getting vaccine big moment everyone currently, people (even phobia) still gets little worked get injection. eat, poor hydration, stood fast, could think tons possibilities.

I catch self almost vagalling average month since time 10 I'm 30. happens.  distancing hurts small businesses can't deal arbitrary distance requirements mega stores get slide capacity exemptions stuff. Cries Canadian third lockdown Never give credit anything? Calm keyboard warrior.  showing lack historical perspective. WWII homefront sacrificed well. Today’s homefront can’t even put damn mask without crying it. Thanks, guess assumed error article since people saying article title content match. mood declined. mean I'm extroverted? Yeah seriously university still talking keeping shit making mad Good you. Yes, what's become clear people choose wager. want gamble strict worth it, save people's lives? want gamble people's lives? great, we’re using 55 now, we’ll quickly position much AZ nothing it. No, understand company concerned employees customers getting COVID premises could “bad brand”.

Why think many businesses Texas still requiring masks? Willing bet it’s realize restaurant, retail store, find news they’re super spreader event probably see drop business. Sir, Wendy’s approved health Canada. they're already going arms. example used 95% efficacy:

you 200 people sitting unmasked room. 100 vaccinated 100 aren't. Everyone room equally exposed COVID.

For every 20 unvaccinated people would expect one vaccinated person get sick. 100 unvaccinated people infected would 5 vaccinated people get infected. Finally hearing people talk. 

While fortune enough wfh since pandemic started, means I’m video calls receiving chat notifications good chunk 8+ hour work day. LAST thing want continue work. mean I’m worse responding socializing online pre pandemic ffs deal time always came excuses bail. get erect. 

-Canada Today’s americans don’t strength fight war unless they’ve military 😂. Physical mental. Empty rural area person here, know told shipping vaccines either. thought going densely populated urban areas first! We’ve learned cope viruses. learn one. haven’t fully figured out, yet. let’s simple things stop spread home, support efforts nations same. think lot people paying attention this. lot damage South America well. Peru deadliest month. Smh fear damage brand

So threatening damage brand business chooses opt vaccine passport system? backed mobility stats. 

According IHME post pandemic 2020 mobility peaked October. led biggest surge seen since beginning pandemic. cases peaked December 2020 - January 2021. Mobility began decreasing October 2020 January 2021. 

Since January 2021 mobility increasing early April 2021 increased beyond even October peak. Yet cases plateaued nationally gone lower numbers 2020. Way Pandemic remember reading Great London Smog 1952. time claims people near death died. later estimates say death rate actually stayed higher months. 

I suspect people recovered covid show higher mortality rate. totally are. actual market fake vaccine cards. None triggers really seem relevant case except *maaaaybe* overheating one. wearing light sweatshirt likes despite feeling tad warm store me.

I'll ask tomorrow remembers feeling warm all. makes sense me. way goes without fight. used problem blood draws nurse pointed unconsciously holding breath, didn’t help matters! could combination factors. poly forward made sure breathe never fainted (except took like 6 vials... low blood pressure begin wasn’t good!). Actually, situation US right quite good.

""At least 961 new coronavirus deaths 68,844 new cases reported United States April 2."" people tired mean *thousands* Americans still dying every week matter? daughter's in-person school minor sore throat/stomachache ""normal"" early spring probably warranted skipping class, circumstances decided play safe, Zoom school day, get COVID test. imagine lot similar cases cold/allergy season plays up.

(She COVID cold went away next day.) California Hawaii talking requiring vaccine passports right, can’t stop them. acting idiotic manner brings risk others.

None us asked hell.

Working together get us faster. Giving “fatigue” slow us cause illness death. That’s selfish idiotic behavior stems from. can’t afford give in.

Today’s Americans would lost WWII January 1942. grasp of, concern for, big picture fortitude work hard paths problems require.

It’s sad. sorry don’t want hear it, needs said. everyone would get vaccinated. Kind sick. sick sick, understand they're actually going open full capacity fall classes.

I'll wait hear they're going require masks even require distancing. what's point? shit feel bit guilty, honestly. 

This second best year adult life! family bs attend (or make excuse get of), friend stuff drains away whole day. kind stranger gets way, cough paths open fast. I'm saying never going control, outside months. might always looming threat .06% death covid. is...let's learn live it. 

How ""awhile longer"" stop disease mutating 100 times third world? shit going bouncing Africans Asians like ping pink ball. 


They never vaccinated. would work UK there's actually national ID system Americans even need ID vote lol I’ll expect legal action least one person. Plenty debunked it. start Wes Pegden  

It discussed greatly across internet since then.  consensus Manus never reached 30% infected (at time). That’s actually yesterday. sound jealous AOC said Nice walk back Let’s stay locked forever. gotta bring interests. There’s lot nerds happen love sports. great example. I’ll first person talk game, hear you’re old school RuneScape I’ve made new best friend happened partner last year. triggers besides mental thing. 

 Here's them:

* standing sitting, bending, lying down
* standing long time
* getting overheated
* intense physical activity
* severe pain
* intense coughing

When happened partner, literally sitting relaxing sudden pain neck, like turn head wrong way/too quickly. Broccoli Rob? follow Dr. Zoidberg Except US *is* prematurely declaring victory, *is* pulling back mitigation policy. 

Oops. another part it. Vietnam one party state citizens behind government experience bugs Exactly, goes without saying. live contributed someone else becoming ill due carelessness.

When over, would rather overly cautious, cautious enough. think know exactly don’t call Chinese variant It’s not. Again, that’s saying need time. It’s time reopen without masks distancing. need tools place awhile longer.

Why that’s contentious beyond me.  Morrison says hi. :)

With seriousness though, much respect team. Played hearts out, absolute killers. Perfect analogy! Ohhhh statics, like covid nice 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️ Great, there’s nothing stop people getting tired covid restrictions calling selfish idiots isn’t valid solution. fact it’s perfectly reasonable pandemic fatigue nearly 13 months told give much considered normal pretty much guaranteed March 2020. Why? fact, actually think *is* third wave, significantly suppressed due vaccinations pre-existing herd immunity Yup. tearing schools killing kids. appreciate correct number ""Bill"" post OK? Try one. Everyone knows vaccines aren’t 100%. Accept that, get jab move Ah yes, Resting Billie Face. I've seen many people sub want Fauci health officials say WANT hear rather officials actually say. example, want Fauci health officials give straight hard end dates health precautions mandates, type toxic positivity work ongoing pandemic things constantly changing data comes in. Hearing hard dates might make mentally feel better realistic position health officials take. montana idaho seems us going willing send vaccine ppl get one Congrats. second dose Moderna yesterday, bad. arm sore first dose, slept 11 hours last night. feel great now. small percentage world vaccinated going sustainable solution? 23% increase EXCESS deaths since March 2021. That's weird wonder why? extrovert say it’s I’m much it. There’s sign waning immunity. always type nonsense? number excess deaths per week 2020 astounding. It’s charts compared anything we’ve see modern know, that's actually **really** surprising that.  vaccinated Sputnik- ridiculous example use. division another older guy lead engineer. worked long time retired couple months back. Found requiring whole team office every day violation california law company directive hated wfh. asked retirement party got away (I shocked) told he'd company 30 years. going do, fire him? guts. (His actual words.). right. older guys fixtures even terrible jobs refuse advance new technologies, untouchable. frustrating fe

i would go head complain shit. unprofessional unproductive way management, losing company money. office politics. pure facts. Yes, well said. There's lot mix introvert antisocial... They're always together. enjoy social all, energy reserve smaller average person guess. really enjoy people's company also love alone time. getting one dose hasn’t fully studied verified trials yet stick CDC Moderna guidance get doses. Anecdotally, sounds like people “rough” first dose easy second dose (and vice versa) long till bans businesses requiring masks? first step? People catching we’ve preaching years. years US basically bought everything. 6 directly funded Warpspeed, indirectly Pfizer, that's 7, **two** (pfizer moderna) worked out. Lesson buy everything widen chances. 

The big thing along warpspeed allowed companies priority supplies manufacturing needs. Lower lability speed-through government. cut red tape companies setting dedicated agencies priority oversight. Dont get wrong companies followed correct procedures regards medical protocols, received resources push without needless waiting. least getting rid restrictions they're this? college still expecting masks, distancing, plexiglass, crap ludicrous fall semester vaccines aren’t expected 100% effective, efficacy showing remarkable. virus still going around massive numbers. That’s need keep masking distancing going bit longer.

Vaccinated people get sick. know this. say things loud like scientific basis make question ""rules"" perhaps make distrustful less inclined follow rules future? CDC said something ridiculous would undermine trust public health messaging. need stop Pfizer moderns many cases people dying getting them. made feel ashamed like I'm laughing stock hermit want protect health.

I would say expand little bit, include protecting people's health. say that, ashamed--you proud, standing what's right even unpopular. reason Europe swimming MRNA vaccines policies US government.

Not true, Europe swimming mRNA could blamed buying first billion doses made Europe something, that's US UK domestic production. want work make shit, go office I’m constantly interrupted people would rather socialize work. don’t social anxiety, really don’t care know peoples’ babies families don’t want talk mine. I’m spectrum, don’t care. 

Covid allowed work home control environment let productive. social bullshit less intrusive chat box could read respond time, without delay I’m seem sociable. 

Extroverts inconsiderate assume everyone want like them. I’m sorry suffered quarantines I’m sorry helpful me. There’s whole social structure around satisfying needs extroverts workplace including physically present, almost consideration people would prefer work differently. I’m surprised study least. welp seem 80% done gives 0% results. title incorrect. article says 23% increase *excess deaths*, defines extra deaths beyond average previous year. seems plausible me, excess deaths typically 1-2%, year might 1.25-2.5%. Guess depends... Moderna 2 little effect coworkers (roughly 50 25-40 year olds) save previously COVID. *2020 TSA America ""temporary measure"" 9/11. almost 20 years later, still here. Masks required game theres mask mandate Indiana. There’s pictures article idk you’re getting not. There's plenty well-educated people, graduated Ivy League schools, anti-vax. looking good people. Stay safe there! ROO DOO DOO! No. didn’t covid. didn’t even leave neighborhood 86 days straight. took things seriously. 

Moderna 2 wreck people. Also dad covid 3 days. 69. Fuckin homerun chippah!  Perfectly balanced They're already shifting messaging loosening. recently said fully vaccinated household hang one unvaccinated household indoors mask. think cdc way cautious. classmate thing happen graphic design project critique. failed entire class hospital weeks afterward.

the kid standing front class collapsed front us didn’t even bother calling ambulance him. one students did. dropped program long that. experimental mRNA therapies approved FDA emergency use mandatory? Prior pandemic UK 2 small vaccine production facilities. 1 seasonal flu jab Japanese Encephalitis vaccine.

The investments domestic vaccine production something took place many years anxiety got boosted last year. running start, standing still start. long wear jacket, don’t need turn heat building without one, right? saying...like science. Facts hard digest Big deal

Not new thing (I.e 80% people vaccine - indoor dining maybe drop masks).

*Maybe*? know we're getting 100%, right? Canada produce Novovax vaccine domestically, according Wikipedia. Nard dog MAKE legal They’ll blindly follow god lacks form evidence vaccine repeated successful results, cover ears.

It’s republican way. end day, people need ask they'd willing sacrifice save someone's life.

Well need specify. ""someone""? close friend family member, lot. randos world? Yeah sorry 99% people care. Novovax also received $1.6 billion OWS develop vaccines, roll soon. 

Overall, OWS huge success. act like fuckwit time, fuckwit. cares point school 

Which also offers pre-med pre-dental programs. wife bad reaction may COVID prior vaccine? Almost coworkers (and me) vaccine previously tested positive absolute worst reactions vaccine (Moderna primarily). great health (triathletes fitness nuts) second worst (Pfizer primarily), ok health seemed reaction vaccine (both). say... understand get diseases orally well, right? Don’t act like they’re dumb ones. wasn’t aware they’re ivy college it, getting vaccine Tuesday  campuses HIV outbreaks covid. That's too. I'm heck lot mingling, tbh. Cornell anything get people remember ivy.  Nah, definitely true. get in, it’ll families money. classmate whose lung collapsed chemistry exam. left halfway thru exam. Prof gave C. Lol outbreak Hand foot mouth disease school years ago. Honestly government require vaccination everything. Renew Driver License - vaccine. File taxes- vaccine. Want passport - vaccine. question this? Technically good psychological practice.
If 90% people Walmart vaccinated wear mask unvaccinated people see still need wear mask. 90% people wearing mask non-vaccinated people see masks they'll assume everything's fine. actuality are, that's goal. clinical study showing masks work? clinical study showing ventilators work covid patients? clinical studies. need clinical study every stupid little thing. tens thousands dollars. That's big part it, people fail focus fact time virus running rampant community, opportunity mutate sort variant resistant current vaccines. happen may already happening. 

The sooner stop giving virus chance spread &amp; mutate better, may end square one.  I'm also going ditch mask minute I'm fully vaccinated longer required. expect 2 continue.

The social pressure join festivities higher ever covid, us extroverts might sensitive introverts ready go fill boar like are, lot going take personal offense....and introverts need sensitive fact that, lot us, wanting join feels like slap face....the danger gone, would introverts want hang out? saying correct lot people going feeling. Masks going 100% protect covid, surgical mask bar, indoors drunk people yelling breathing you, could guessed would get covid. sucks, makes sense. that, natural immunity didnt get even though didnt wear mask. Also seems expected.
The cloth masks help everyone wearing them, ""mask mandates"" people eating restaurants help much. whole European situation could’ve different, a) Macron didn’t pressure EU betting ""French"" Sanofi vaccine instead made sure vaccine would available January b) Sanofi‘s vaccine trial wouldn’t gone badly.

Of course c) - protectionist vaccine policy like countries seem love, would also alternative. Europe big producer vaccines. Imagine producing themselves. I'm still terrified meningitis. declined shot college regretted bc I'm worry wart. understand need vaccine need now? long people, never ever cared testing process pharmaceuticals, put terrible things body daily, need satisfied?

Also, government way. Literally none people involved even close now. Yeah, actually great engineering school  Based analysis numbers, **probabably least month**. roughly [255M [104M 64M hesitant. leaves 87M waiting shot.

Since J&amp;J huge numbers, let's pessimistic assume everyone needs 2 doses. We've vaccinating 3M day right now, 1.5M new people. 87M 1.5M day 58 days. keep accelerating expect beat that. Still, see demand drying least May, even though there's ton confounding factors. Think people stop hesitating friend tells ""All got sore arm"" people want vaccine procrastinating. interoverted honestly point able leave house walk even seeing people 10 months impact mental health.

I'd say effects come later may depend live, able do, etc. news, street may 6 new covid cases went bed last night requiring MMR vaccines? meningococcal?

All standard requirements many, all, universities. I’ve actually surprised smooth vaccine rollout area, hope don’t fire whoever charge optimizing it. Ooooh talk shit? loved ones get sick die? surprise...pandemic fatigue...people traveling...anti maskers....i wont surprised movie songbird comes true months years ahead. Tokyo’s Japan’s climate nothing like Florida’s. northern parts Japan snowiest places Earth. may humid, it’s MUCH colder outside Okinawa. Tl;dr: problems AZ vaccine itself, plant also ruined millions J&amp;J doses.  Gonna downer say NEARLY. couple elderly 80+ people WA State die breakthrough infection. like 99.999% death Yeah “what mah freedumb” folks probably ain’t gettin Cornell one seems know washington 8 people vaccinated hospitalized covid 2 people died. Oh sure rub faces people probably die. 

Where people come from? 

Oh right, one reasons everyone hates us. Imagine actually thinking COVID even level Spanish flu?

Jesus guys terrified Correction: Social Media run morally corrupt person like Mark Zuckerberg mistake Yes duh. That’s wrote dude. however completely ignore fact real parameter hospitalization.

Humanity could live perfectly fine another seasonal infection low death rates. That’s vaccines works fine. Except can’t get it, lives don’t actually matter right? Study also stated quite lot deaths delayed care behavioural issues would bet ends wash harvard upstate new york would never go outside could get wfh forever. Oh goodness would happiest person earth. everything ever wanted home. Gawd would love stay home.... would pay. argue since Cornell private, could institute whatever wanted requirement. crazed, repubs love crap benefits them? That's gross anyone gets satisfaction this. people get sick ultimately die places. 

I hate american people speak like countries. 

That's shameful. Wealthy people love arts. Liberal wealthy people, least. nonzero percentage students 18 scheduled begin classes, Pfizer authorized 18, however there's currently mechanism request specific vaccine. 

It's conceivable exists weird amalgam situations student get vaccinated despite best intentions unfairly barred entrance. We've got 4 months figure though. take bay leaves cooking!! really feel this. Lol ag school mean study stopped reading headline specifically states CDC still encouraging mask wearing? Well, mean bad people would think pandemic, average iq population gone due natural selection. feel like past year counts ""time"" Edgy. needs class falling? That's great, remember keep taking precautions though. vaccine immunity 2 weeks, 6 weeks full vaccine effect. “I need sour grapes.” thought article would about. ""Efficacy"" important infectious disease experts, relates rate spread, us, care odds hospitalization given strong exposure.

So really want know much vaccine reduces rate hospitalization given strong exposure. boyfriend literally two. given one time got shot. saw like WTF. That's good! He's honest figure concerned first. analogy yes lol. get vaccines soon. choose that’s them. could CDC ever claim that? vaccine works. googled it, quite specific racist. said referring group people ""surge"" means invasion, something threatening. actual word. ""A surge covid cases"" nothing it. I'm agreeing her, probably joking I'm explaining meant. Idiots keep brainlessly complying restrictions standing reason still “dealing” this. Sorry burst bubble fear sensationalism. It’s straight theatre keep people asking questions ventilation Ok college faculty staff community grandma? Lol ok much mainly London big city areas, people masks Vaccinations. see alot news dramatically small amount people. People wanna get things here, people UK whining nothing rights infringed... 

Not alot government ask people moan like b*tch say ""it's tryanny"". people need reality check. bad made UK really ain't news decides make be. News spin however want to, alot folk know around UK say number couple hundred protest walks. rest getting it, well that's true think media coverage it, heavily focus negatives. to......?

Europe, US, China, Canada, Japan, Korea, Dubai etc. Sydney airport 49th busiest airport earth pandemic.

Toronto 32nd busiest. 4 10 busiest US. London busiest city network airports world. vibrant tourism, international business, foreign student higher education system. 

And think countries that? really deluded? people visited Toronto overseas pre-pandemic Sydney. London Paris amongst visited cities. short - don’t know talking about

I feel like that's bud.

Australia huge advantage geography. Sure things went well, geographical position Australia greatest strength this, kidding think otherwise. Reasonable ? 

Pah, unfashionable!

/S Downvoting moving on. much misinformation post hand  People keep saying see evidence. think Dr. Feigl-Ding sharing valuable knowledge going scare - scared stupid politicians acted last 14 months.

This pandemic going end soon could ended last year politicians obsessed delaying action case spikes. cannot believe don’t tread CHUDs deep conspiracy pay money risk criminal records get something fake normally comes life saving vaccine Yay! 2 go I’m going bars traveling again. grateful haha. Let’s go back normal! like preferences coexist recognize people different levels socializing tolerance accommodate instead expect everyone thrives conditions.. 

E.g. let's make working home option want it. case, still dinner parties, understanding someone leaves two hours social reserves used up.

Covid gonna provide exemptions medical concerns vaccine (allergic reactions, experiences relatives involves medical issues, etc) requiring people recovered already vaccinated? VA done excellent job getting vaccines scheduled arms, many hesitant people work also veterans. It’s shame aren’t coming around it. great explanation real reading comprehension problem, don’t you?  Right? Yes, that's mean. Almost none currently closed stay closed, going keep restrictions place long prevent actually spend money students pay them. shame deaths still hovering close 1000 per day US yet vaccines administered. Still, can’t generalize two examples. That's outdated. nets bridges now. dumb unfair older world get easy. 
And cool. 
And awesome. Sure, say, *very* promising leads there. trying dampen expectations bit, people get hyped up, end disappointed treatments initially end working less obscure sub-types cancer.

In medium term future, mRNA-based technology absolutely invaluable finally getting cancer control.  They’re pretty much poster children exact point sooooo actually *very* unpopular opinion, considering literally everyone believes *some* level regulations private institutions follow US? doubt mask mandates still effect states July. Meh. I'm fully vaccinated, bought blank ones. filled one info, I'm saving rest.

I want able keep laminated one me, want original stay unlaminated get boosters put onto card. I'll fill another one blanks updated info get laminated. requiring flu vaccines legal? Facing apparent doom fight back win kind thing. think every Hollywood blockbuster showcases kind situation? misleading? says AZ production stopped; fact! mean, never heard campuses before? still Cornell different city reduce transmission, right? reason one 4 million people got vaccinated today. Maybe cases Florida Texas lower right everyone got earlier due lax policies ""well neither two people went ivy league schools fit description. Can't true"" fuck cares lol live tiny rural town see bot accounts sock puppet accounts local news’s Facebook posts every single time post anything Covid. lot people conservative genuinely skeptical Covid news, times bots gave away posting false Covid stories nothing Covid. bot farms going hard tearing country apart seams, nobodies anything it. allowing students certain skin colors attend? 3rd, 4th 5th, tuesday - anything! add discussion? discussion math. hate phrasing. risk burns

Which assume likely one tries inhale 56C fumes. Burns nasal mucosa. can’t find grid professor straight evil. current strains, yeah. part plan prevent spread slow mutations? Future mutations could target younger people. I'm typically nationalistic I'm gonna lie stabilized spike *should* source national pride. missteps made pandemic good investment actually proud government.

That say AZ vaccine bad vaccine made gamble something ended better. This. still maintain fact Covid got *this* bad anomaly caused petty leadership ""what always gonna happen"" like say General distrust authorities previous incidents. Mostly years decades ago. One diabetes drug marketed weight loss turned dangerous.  public loses trust health officials it’s hard win back. Could business double prices give 50% discount show vaccination certificate? feel like colleges huge problem, men women WANT vaccinated anyhow. 

Bigger issue going elementary schools like. I'm already hearing parents claiming they'll refuse vaccinate kids sue they're allowed attend class. might clusterfuck. It’s funny one cares also probably spoiled millions AZ vaccines too, ingredients two mixed. covid proselytizers protected class Masks aren’t magic.

People USA seem think ignore 70k cases per day think masks magic panacea.

There still uncontrolled community spread Covid. 

Until either vaccinate way mess start actually obeying social distancing guidelines continue, Stop virtue signalling. Ask without virtue signalling answer.  people look back Joseph Smith think, con many people? how. honestly get victim attitude conspiracy theories regards Astrazeneca.

It seems perfectly reasonable US want Astrazeneca, things considered (US plenty vaccines, AZ causing CVST, problems studies reporting results, etc.).  indeed Emergent BioSolutions plant several weeks ago conflated ingredients J&amp;J AstraZeneca vaccines,
The government’s move facility make J&amp;J single-dose vaccine meant avoid future mix-ups One stupidest posts I've seen here, cheers mate So, okay ""private business"" refusing service reason? includes sexual orientation race. *is* private business. cant ways.

Really hope get move vaccine. good experience Covid last year could hoped, countries better. need lock success getting locally produced vaccine vulnerable populations. remember correctly, actually produce large quantity annual flu vaccines. happens wrong vaccine infrastructure making COVID vaccines capacity egg-based flu vaccine. vaccine rollout one VA. agencies absolutely deserve A+ one.  statistics back up? odds person 25 dying Covid astronomically low. do? Cut world? kidding. least people acknowledge introverts “thing” now. tell people specific amount energy need work next week (or month lol). Melbourne covid got quarantine super spreading events resulted widespread community transmission.

Other parts Australia lockdowns. Steve Jobs anti vaxx lol   Based facts science? UK ;) emergency use, phase III trial, non FDA approved vaccines? Compared to......?

The Sydney aoirport 49th busiest airport earth pandemic.

1/5 population born overseas. vibrant tourism, international business, foreign student higher education system. 

In short - don’t know talking about.

It easier us actually listen health advice. lawsuit Im glad you’ve seeing improvement, good you!! It’s really good know people benefitting situation. think lot work places getting flexible it, maybe pandemic help process along. Twice since everyone needs two doses. Weird.. know like 3 people?

In BC know 7 people gotten covid.

1 death. I'm concerned ""what FDA approval""?  Facts, subreddit crawling American bs. picture empty stadium. people dumb working medicine?

Is bar really low? numbers going people stop getting tested lol. Texas open pretty much since november hundred eighty-seven days Broadway went dark, faint light started glimmer two performers — one time — bare Broadway stage. together conjured decades theater lore, invoking songs shows stars filled grand houses around Times 36-minute event, masked audience 150 scattered across auditorium 1,700 seats, first experiment since coronavirus pandemic caused 41 Broadway houses close March 12, 2020, industry leaders hoping promising step sure slow bumpy road eventual reopening. long deaths. /s die covid it. production sites within EU provides US drug product, filled finished US. US providing drug product components Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccine, actually goes ways. 

The numbers finished doses exported EU US total producers one million it’s like flow vaccines escaping EU ending US. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Wrong. It’s fully produced Netherlands.

Yeah that’d cool actually. I’d love get moderna shot knowing it’s origins close home. error affect Johnson &amp; Johnson doses currently delivered used nationwide, including shipments states counting next week. **All doses produced** **Netherlands**, operations fully approved federal wastewater detection proving useful?  

Here Australia it’s constantly going regional areas due recovered (but still shedding) cases wandering around.  leaks quarantine get missed workers pooping waste system known infected quarantine.

So kind gets ignored now.  

This wasn’t helped several states talking much recovered shedders.  Would possibly work better they’d keep detections quiet *can’t* find recovered person area. think they’re worried wrong, missing outbreak incorrectly assumed recovered patient, accused hiding data. game perfect reciprocity. EU US exchanging raw materials equipment vaccines quite freely throughout pandemic. think 25-30% vaccinated we’ll see positive effects That's weird conclusion considering J&amp;J production benefiting move.

This mostly Emergent BioSolutions mess coupled bad press getting though, AZ. vaccine currently approved logically took precedent choosing two facility can't trusted make one vaccine apparently. Giggity! Good. time travel.   Agree, though think things go well. think AZ vaccine fine, there's pretty bad PR couple fact people first hand experience covid outbreak like US Europe motivation fast efficient vaccine roll uptake population going pressing. can't see quarantine lifted till end year. Maybe EU take action give Halix plant J&amp;J ask make J&amp;J vaccines EU - like AZ lines US. US without AZ production, EU too. Short term, huh? put much trust government. better reporting system Norway someone obviously didnt read article sure strong opinion it. love skip line. totally unrealistic (how produce 30% estimate?!) toeing line writing contracts plant would produce UK/EU, especially dragging EMA procedure. 

They continue scummy. Remember EU found 30 million vaccines Italy wasn’t clear countries would go? proper European Commissioner even phoned way way AZ CEO still couldn’t get answer. 
When hit news outlets, suddenly vaccines became covax programme vaccines vaccines EU. 
I don’t know countries, suddenly got amount pretty much double biggest AZ package ever. happened within 2 days, it’s clear originally weren’t EU (because otherwise would great PR: “Look, biggest delivery!” vs total silence) UK within last 12 months. Go Big Red! European, idea universities requiring vaccines odd. It’s private medical decision. hate introvert / extrovert classification. scale, binary thing. think move scale course lifetime. asked 18, I'd answer introvert. Today I'd say I'm 7 10 extrovert side. I've managed totally fine pandemic, miss going beers friends colleagues time time. 

When guys say introvert next sentence say work environment toxic - \_sure\_ chicken vs egg thing here? one wants socialize peoeple drain energy you. Yeah congestion well! compromise quality taste smell though. guess whole body like, “oh gon this?? Okay fine *inflame everything*” wanted pop say vaccines 100% part medical history records, fool.

Ok, carry on. still one million much getting single vaccine return.  need overthink this. effect vaccine shown terms reduced numbers cases, hospitalization death crucial Germany open can. I’m starting get confident good summer without evil fall surge last year. Makes sense. can’t afford make mistakes like kinda hope south saturated get higher proportion moderna New England, NH sort hometown hero. get offer vaccination, people time get me.


And then, I’m taking every mask burning mask cookout sesh


I never wear mask Pretty much expected point. small group friends plans dinner weekend 16th two weeks last us shot would got second shot Friday. plan ordering lobster. couple us gotten together fishing first time we've together since February last year. Ok I'm starting think know ""educated"". graduated honours graduate honours. ass negwte degree Canada bought even more.  

Don’t remember vaccines actually launched Canada criticised buying enough shots vaccinate entire population 4 times over?

They didn’t local manufacturer, couldn’t get dibs first batches. Serious question. were? Thanks. needed read this.

Please correct I’m wrong, using vectors 15 million vaccines significant amount? Clickbait title Reuters, using produce J&amp;J full capacity, since AZ needed received authorization. title makes seem like AZ fault production problems. Get line lol Lets honest, probably stay inside nothing lol basically government used incident sideline AstraZeneca. think used approved anytime soon US given government's support three vaccines approved.  don’t think did?

The way I’m reading it, used AZ ingredient (the vector) JJ batch instead correct JJ one. AZ would fine, assuming didn’t use all.

Think flour cake sugar meringue.  swap two ingredients deserts ruined.  mix flour sugar ruined. use flour meringue, cake still fine (unless ran flour).

Gotta remember everyone goes Cornell US...

I think Cornell right thing here, hope plan international students. According researchers University Pennsylvania Duke University50, mRNA vaccines potential safety issues:

Local systemic inflammation.

Stimulation auto-reactive antibodies. 

Induction potent type 1 interferon response, associated inflammation potential autoimmunity. Thus, identification individuals increased risk autoimmune reactions mRNA vaccination undertaken.

There also concern potential mRNA modifications genetics body. injected body mRNA vaccines take RNA virus cell may create unwanted detrimental genetic modifications. evidence (source: Prof. Drosten, podcast, German) townships South Africa reached 50-60%. brought escape mutation. experience: colleague Johannesburg sick April January. Second time mild symptoms. though? might reach herd immunity then, population willing get it. course 🥰 stay mad issue Fauci health officials (including ones breaking health guidelines *cough California cough*) approaching completely detached perspective. standings statements come almost always without human element “people’s livelihoods mental health can’t survive living pure lockdown”. numbers either inconsistent, much high expectation, playing safe harms us ways (Fauci saying children can’t play without masks they’re vaccinated - wouldn’t happen late 2021/2022 earliest).

You remember CDC discourages things like medium rare steaks safe temperatures (they specify internal temp 145 safe consumption, 10-20 degrees rare/medium-rare steak temps). certain point risk populations vaccinated (or chosen vaccinated). People need get back lives, states like Florida Texas already shown lifting mask mandates capacity restrictions haven’t doomsday consequences left insisted would happen.

Fauci CDC embrace medium-rare steak mentality sake everyone’s sanity well-being. Antisocial behavior. Check. totally agreed. always better safe sorry or... sick/dead.  Wow. low demand. Good though. Good too. least peace mind Yes, anti vaxers uneducated. That’s entire premise. Trump encourage vaccines volition Cruz around POS. Magna cum laude worthless let constituents die money 🥰 they’re idiots prime examples point. us completely removed parents. mom threatened multiple times finds get vaccine, I'm allowed live anymore dead serious.

I'm one dealing issues. Combat sports cool. couldn’t relate either I’m afraid. I’m bit nerd going vaccinate students haven’t vaccinated way provide free vaccines diseases. Yeah. I’m proud mass wanting vaccine bunch it’s bit double edged sword guess lol probably wear mask crowded places while. i'm cautious virus anywhere unless 100% people vaccinated. animals carry around also.. ... what? used show arms. Check costumes Best Little Whorehouse Texas example. keloid scarring that’s she’s covering. IT’S PRONOUNCED “CORNELL!” States schools require eventually.

Yeah real silent killer college debt creepin ya. live part California claimed mask compliance near 100%, coworkers insisted going office every day walk around holding mask hand show they're making effort. knew people like alone actually enjoy it. one least insane parts US... 

Corporations people, lobbyists, campaign financing, electoral college, strict liquor laws, private prisons, Floroda general make pretty insane too. they’re smart they’ll keep town area almost everyone wears mask sticks basic rules. Manchester they've much harder rules past infection rate increasing said person. That's city always protest, people dumb whinging ""freedom"" government asking alot you... People acting like communism 😑course it'll happen shithole London... 

London full selfish arseholes ever London? materialistic things one person better another give toss that. ridiculously expensive even bills/buying small house.. couple thousand 60mil+ getting always revolt disagree what's happening especially within city areas prices 3x amount town areas. opinions completely factual?


Dont asume anything here, first even american, second liberal left leaning. vaccination passports nothing conservative right wing rise 20 states, that’s fourth wave don’t know is

Deaths increase even cases vulnerable vaccinated. Even deaths went slightly now, way constitute 'wave'. simply small delay become long term downward trend. 

This fear mongering popular 3 months ago. Think time moved on. annual capacity SII? 

I’m pretty sure end year BioNTech/Pfizer/Fosum produced far doses AstraZeneca/SII sequencing tools noted actually sweet fa usefulness NZ never single strain once.

These tools would useful EU literally 100's different strains floating around. Bob Sue neighbours caught virus, sequencing tell strain different stains. linkage known case closed contract tracers time saved; unlinked contract tracers need track two separate clusters. 2nd dose 30th soreness body aches fine took **ibuprofen** nap 2 days yeah helped took Pfizer-BionTech got Pfizer shot 15 hours ago. Arm feels like someone punched hard still. normal?  AZ shared vaccine details SII make billions doses. world cannot wait powdered versions mrna vaccines honestly. J&amp;J vaccine seems like good candidate single shot stored aim refrigerators. one mind new-found anonymity. kinda nice able run store feel like spend half hour putting makeup, told ""smile"" asshole probably anti-masker. plenty people ""fucking hate"" masks. fair article quite badly written First need vaccines get second moderna shot Wednesday, I'm taking vacation days Thursday Friday. I'm telling youngest take care good practice I'm old take care myself. think I'm funny. called local retail pharmacy asked could schedule appointment, since become eligible 7th. told click box I’m teacher schedule appointment date I’m eligible. anyone else told this? seems logical don’t want breaking rules here. what? Still invented Dutch people, living Netherlands, educated Dutch universities, etc. grandma person working facility dies corona, people working profit American company??? Imagine uproar USA factories would export China India. Imagine uproar. companies would nationalized blink, crisis situation. Export restrictions would installed less blink. facts, country exported vaccines yet.

B) exporting AZ UK J&amp;J USA. produced Leiden. Dutch people received 0 doses yet domestically produced vaccines 50 states. still stuck 65+ land. [xkcd powdered version Pfizer/BioNTech approved, well could vaccine go developing world. Pfizer/BioNTech shown capable companies terms scaling production. 

In general platform seems scalable, much, much AZ platform extremely sensitive problem ridden. Pfizer applying full FDA approval month. rate vaccine may approved school fall. approved mandatory vaccinations college attendence effect MMR, meningitis, etc. 

[Pfizer Apply Full FDA Approval April Ah yes, called immunity doesn’t happen immediately vaccination. typically takes 2 weeks body build immunity.

Also sure long vaccine lasts for, wearing mask could pose risk.

Wearing mask pandemic still going makes sense. Also anti makers (idiots), walking around saying fully vaccinated get wearing mask spreading talk get ppl vaccinate. Actually going this, creating class ubermensch untermensch, going get annihilated courts. Rightfully so. anyone would ship us vaccines would take them. I'm fine businesses restricting want serve, masks passports whatever

What bit less fine implied threat businesses adopt vaccine passports brand damaged. Yes, probably obese. quick google search:

More Half Brazilian Population Overweight; Obesity Climbing Rapidly. Data released Ministry Health show 55.7 percent population Body Mass Index rate considered ""normal"" World Health Organization. basically number one method contact tracing

Contract tracing primarily find people infectious tested. Genomic sequencing help that. 

The magic sequencing confirm rule linkages linkages unknown. free resources trying link unrelated cases confirm existing assumed epidemiological linkages.

Not critical, really amazing tool toolkit still secondary tool.

Wastewater could useful tool too, date think AU 100 alerts actual unknown cases found. poop virus way long seems set false alerts. someone UK, I’m hoping information NHS provides international travel access anonymous - states you’re vaccinated, half vaccinated, fully vaccinated, mention vaccine manufacturer. don’t trust EU nations try drag mud given opportunity to, they’ve done every opportunity thus far. r/theydidthemath weird one UK many deaths France, France total cases Covid. there's report article goes ways explaining i've missed it. Maybe thought could help world end Covid pandemic sitting idly sidelines. supplying vaccines cost important poorer nations. companies making vaccines better us. time international students come back fall, universities enough vaccines they’ll get campus. That’s plan articulated me, anyway. think they’ll ok. anything, free AZ doses don’t think US approve vaccine time soon domestic production anymore. 

Probably impact EU all, possibly J&amp;J availability bit higher, given production capacity US larger US less dependent EU produced doses. biggest fear used meningitis

I think probably still is, know Covid isnt nice hardly meningitis think strong suspicion chance science eventually comes says it’s unnecessary, mean people won’t wear them. can’t blame people don’t wear masks vaccination science confirms it. Especially location spread low collapsing towards zero weather vaccinations. high-spread situation perhaps it’s good idea err safe side (which also correct message country whole).  Yeah, falsifying federal document, lot risks making chump change MRNA vaccines available refrigerable form soon. ideal situation really developing vaccine scratch never done need speed trumps almost everything else really case normally plan them, least North East. university starting vaccinate pop ups week around campus.

To knowledge, required college vaccine EUA. 

Just one twists words, misunderstands point; think colleges require covid vaccine. first shot waiting second. Get vaccinated. 30% population 16 younger, meaning cant take vaccine.

Pop Marshall's smell fancy soaps, walk taco place take food outdoor bar block down, meet friend lunch shopping, etc. even miss going work, appreciate home I'm always here. *was* Imagine asking Reddit someone medical degree.  I’d say EU done mistakes, opening new BioNTech facility Marburg, partially funded German government, clear situation drastically improve. 

Moderna also ramping deliveries like crazy EU. It’s still small deliveries, Q2 see 3-4 times doses delivered. 

On top this, JnJ made commitments deliver 55M doses Q2 - current delivery schedule suggesting actually happen. (Very different AZ sold 180M doses Q2 commit 50-70M) get tetanus shot went state school. think another one redo records lost. remember requirement suggestion, wanted women get HPV shot time. made sense male shot wasnt available rate like 1/3 woman campus HPV. got well. 

No biggie. June 17-August 31st - Covid over! Party nightclubs. Get gang 8 people go cinema you!

September 1st - lol anymore pal. False. clearly disagreed you. 

If pattern emerges investigate. scientist conclude there's nothing results in. 

Obviously surface numbers low, however, leads people longer wanting vaccinated concerns never addressed, problem becomes huge. I’m glad get vaccine Wednesday. Hope don’t die I’d rather take chances vaccine covid. exact opposite happen.

During finals one digital media classes floor throwing pain huge-ass ovarian cyst rupturing. prof called ambulance asked (couldn't afford talk taking waves pain hour) professor canceled entire class gave final project even though def B max. whole semester people would happily wave one present day lmao US stopped production one vaccine avoid problems different vaccine. reflects US’ views important. catch cold flu anything I'm still wearing mask.

B) can’t claim export JnJ AstraZeneca logic again, you’ve managed ignore point! Deaths simultaneously sad rare point big deal. one cases.

nowhere say aggregators worthwhile, tweets would worthwhile.

also based comment sounds like NYS specifically technical hurdles (captcha) prevents full data, case could say something like ""in NYS try aggregators strike it'll also worthwhile check sites directly!"" would completely fair statement. 

Might fair statement elsewhere well, say aggregators useless comical.

btw there's lot US-folk outside NYC. Lololol get fucked loser Good move. Astra Zenica joke JnJ EU market mainly produced Netherlands 3 first months filled mainly Takeda Germany. It’s true original plans fill US, guess increased US production skepticism EU regarding possible US export ban made JnJ change mind. 80% people vaccine

Yeah, we're going get high uptake adults. Maybe high 60's best. look people never got flu vaccines years. Lmao stupid loser. Go play apex Spain say vaccinated even illegals. I'm legal show say go home. disconnect national policy local medical clinics.

In Turkey get Chinese vaccine. expats afraid it. There's ID system UK need ID vote. kind records love see.

Also, shouldn’t BBC report international issues? Getting J&amp;J tomorrow. almost better Christmas Andy Bernard approves. Yeah big fucking yikes thread There’s two effects playing allow sort mixing; Get vaccinated you’ll allowed meet friends vs. guys allowed ignore rules, I’m going well. 

There’s tipping point it’s worth amplifying first argument drive vaccination rates, even results uptick transmission (less vulnerable) unvaccinated. 

We’re yet though, particularly supply vaccines constrained uptake already high. point every month postpone sort mixing results millions vaccinated. Reality check:

Cumulative deaths per million 

UK- 1871

France- 1415


If there’s leader questioned BBC Boris Johnson. mean want see people... don't? one forcing EvEr hEArD iT?!? Still five France though first world? Idk. I'm 70-100C sauna time depends temperature amount humidity lower end range pretty comfortable regular nasal breathing, however much steam generate throwing water hot stones. 100C heavy steam comfortable breath mouth slowly though, cools way. Jesus that’s scary one reason  Rutgers already said Give two weeks full immunity hit  school make exemptions \[...\] religious beliefs. 

Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

While generally believe ignorant believers ""JeSuS HaTeS VaCcInEs"" would make Cornell, policy right would abused hell every anti-vaxxer vicinity. stratospheric raise alcohol drug overdose year speaks fact people enjoying much minority. huge percentage people's lives ruined social isolation year something trivialise. Exactly! articles use clickbait titles. Really hard understand BC gov waited spring break clamp things. looking like pretty disastrous needless mistake. tell USA 1) bet big early Moderna Pfizer

Those companies existing facilities US. That's reason vaccination gone well. Every region existing vaccine production facilities done extraordinarily well, exception EU exported vaccines kept (which do). administered GGD, GPs. article bit clickbait. AZ supposed mostly administered GPs. They'll probably redistribute vaccines there.

The GGD vaccinating health workers, age requirement came in, left many scattered appointments, decided pause vaccinations would haveled spillage. That's least got articles currently making rounds Dutch media. Dude chill talking vaccinations/anything medical related long illegal and/or serious violation human rights. need bring race. Michael? I'm actually EU see one would interpret ""saying getting doses EU implies many countries EU so"". implies that, well, getting doses EU. one countries, matter relevant discussion hand.

But own. weird you’re second person thread specifically use word charlatan meant case anything medical related That’s actually highly illegal cause lot law suits. Sad part people won’t question feel like they’re good thing.  Right Pfizer lasts *up to* 6 months it’s 6 months since first doses administered, month still protected add another month long confirm vaccine protect us. could 6 months, 1 year, 2 years (?), knows, time tell. Enjoy ;) Probs vaccine causes long term serious illness death organisations sued oblivion Twitter right leaning now? 
 
I'm confused.

Reddit super left compared reddit 5 years ago. Thats undeniable. believe find people run circles fancy ivy league grads confusion every elite school.  Oh yeah. Elite liberal arts colleges 2k total student enrollment capella groups flagship public universities lol. yet, current 7 day average, extrapolating last published data 47 March 24th using 30% reduction per week would 28. Extrapolating single digit deaths take 4 weeks i.e. April 21st +-a bit vaccinating variance. 

The delayed method **was** huge win. longer unsubstantiated rumor mostly false. studies shown extreme decrease transmissibility vaccination Andy Bernard would proud! movie Almost certainly. I’d surprised border weren’t fully open late Q3/early Q4. US ready first we’ll follow months after. 150 1700 sear room. way survive. snl shows months? even worse... work social obligations. No, don’t want go lunch traffic-choked city celebrate new intern. apply here. difference! 

Not according dictionaries. others said. Locally produced guarantees supply. rates Canada always somewhat lower

That's true, Canada also significantly better comes deaths per million. date first shot full vaccination 1.25-1.5 months MRNA vaccines. Yes, protection earlier think people understanding lag. pretty long actually. Getting shot vs able worry infection sickness same. Porque los dos? definitely still fly now. Unless bed ridden hospital, making finals am. even hard sell missed grading deadline. less week finals end. Get ASAP reduce transmission risk population risk personal safety. Studies shown vaccine remains effective several months. necessary future, able get booster  see situation like thread made it. unfair demand introverts live life designed extraverts believe 12 weeks chosen balancing age groups vaccine supply rates, point saves lives put 2nd dose 70 year old first dose 40 year old. countries gone six week interval. long vector immunity expired time doses determined supply. 

After first dose AstraZeneca Pfizer stabilise efficacy 58% 34 days, giving significantly risk group 2nd dose get groups efficacy 78-90% result fewer deaths. Honestly feels like fir first time since beat Colombia world cup penalties 2018 people UK media daring say something positive country. time Kate Wills wedding  Exactly.

Most developed places alright well expect EU course. article leaving important part. Many players likely P1 variant Brazil. made way Canada spreading there. reports young healthy athletes getting sick. like 6 months ago everyone asymptomatic. pathogens... investigations looking mRNA use immunotherapy cancer well. JJ vaccine even approved Netherlands? not, see issues. least Netherlands interfering contracts US did.  don’t problem separating work personal life even commute. don’t miss restaurants social stuff even little. much want pandemic end want able continue living like this. Also, introvert (I literally went take dozen online tests see years back there’s discussion friends it). don’t know am, thread worried tbh, don’t miss things introverts say miss to. I’m like chill, found things do, read, hobbies, walks, took educational courses, it’s productive busy, switched stuff, many experiences life, interacting people part it, I’ve experienced already, there’s much new left there... Anyone still thinks “vaccine” good idea point idiot. small bit research show that. Yeah would never trust company pushed pain killers causing opioid crisis.

Its like big pharma never done anything would cause doubt 🙄 Thanks! I’m thinking too. told discuss occurred rhe vaccine doctor specialists. family able too, get vaccinated help protect him. 

You don’t happen know there’s still concern taking advil tylenol help symptoms, you? recall beginning pandemic concern it. sure rumors  ""MeowMeowBeanz"" Well is, since young women probably would survived Covid (if caught it). Pretending like big deal ""you"" made vaccine criminally egocentric. 

Your accusation therefore obnoxious also directed wrong person. two different things though. vaccination success US doesn’t mean forget died US handled COVID terribly that. EU fucked vaccination infection death numbers still much lower US. fucking vaccinations means pain much longer though. Higher efficacy 12 week gap, also Germany literally using UK strategy boost number people 1st vaccinations. even done medical personnel.....the seniors next, may take Fall rate going. 
Japan many good points, incredibly incompetent time sensitive situations flexibility required. incentives govt workers ""not make mistake resulting following rules letter"", would literally rather watch people die take even obviously benign shortcut. bureaucrats, better thousand die everyone vaccinated single person die allergic reaction missed say, dentist giving jab catch symptoms. also fun us UK smug situation compared EU hate got Brexit. Maybe arent failing nation way states fault they're getting enough doses? stopped trial AZ done hideous job running trial reporting data. Multiple times. Full stop. Nope, effect that. Still extremely low risk transmission due nature type virus regardless variants. know AstraZeneca producing small medium sized facilities around world, addition SII. Clearly produce lot doses, now, output disappointing, say least. I’ll positively surprised AZ manages produce doses BioNTech/Pfizer 2021. 

I’m saying trash AZ way, it’s supply chain production unfortunately problem ridden producers. one recorded TV? cameras kill covid something? Welcome battle shots! it’s highest rank ivy league. Okay see saying now. Yeah, UK has, definition, exported vaccine EU too, final sale EU. EU argue say party exporting product final use outside it. I'm sure that's true, least makes sense require twisting meaning exports. would think would common sense. well reopening parks outdoor facilities uv light proven kill Covid 19 extremely quick effectively. papers I've seen indicate immunity vaccine works Brasil variant. Amazingly problems viruses ignored, even covered up, yes are, search Google ""Pfizer vaccine deaths"" yes articles even using exact words first two pages results supposed AZdeaths?...........how easy see manipulated data. Yeah? So? Keep sporting mask, works much covid. Masks largely prevented flu cities. Lol what. wear mask 40 hours week job mask never gets wet. licking inside mask something? V-anon someone currently large school, optimistic. done nothing guarantee us shitty covid policies end fall, already shitty covid policies planned summer. still going mixed classes online even. 

Given steadily track vaccinations are, acceptable, but, saves money, soo..... Jokes you, majority people can't reasonably afford it! Already covid positive antibody cell test 9 months out. need vaccine zero science suggest do. bodies Brazil. Maybe they're fake bodies? $10, cheapest 3 approved don’t think natural immunity yet. India similar median age Mexico, India much better testing rate Mexico. yet Mexico recorded 10x deaths India. Mexico even admitted probably reported half actual deaths. Well pulled - helped develop vaccine less 12 months, something many experienced developers failed wonder much j j vaccine....the attacks various vaccines political, deaths almost insignificant mean people die taking aspirin.

This money political profits. certain point becomes darwinism. want breathing everyone's air, got vaccine, know vaccinated people carriers. funeral. I'm sorry feel way, that's unique Covid, always like that. clearly understand manufacturing agreement vaccine. AZ producer - around 13 different countries producing vaccine across world. like AZ solely responsible production. vaccine producers issues production - J+J recently spoilt 15 million doses - lead delays. AZ/Oxford made agreements largest manufacturing capacity production sites get optimal efficiency, producing vaccine anyone.

Compare AZ's manufacturing Moderna's even close regards greater AZ's capacity - hence Moderna little impact globally. misinformation evidence support claim? information everyone mother curious got approved, take information continue say “yeah BUTTTT” that’s you, understand concern us 100% sure since can’t be, catching covid outweighs lot risks.

Don’t get vaccine you’re worried it. did, I’m fine, genuinely don’t think hundreds millions people going turn zombies start growing cancerous tumors around us couple years, that’s worry honestly respect decisions get it.

I hope don’t catch covid mean time, mean genuinely well, please stay keep safety measures you’ve place lessen chance catching it. ""New Bering Strait variant everything.

It actually flips old, news articles long they've alive (100+ years).  feel like major vaccine producers making mistakes, major corporations better insulated potential fallout smear campaigns.

I'm anti-mask data suggests utility general public much limited many people seem think; they've sort become like protective talisman lot folks.

Deaths covid dropped cliff state, another month two start become harder justify continued restrictions especially vaccinated people.  People need able get back normal. There's less motivation get vaccine public health messaging is, ""Nothing change."" don’t disagree “no vaccine 100%” view statements problematic someone claims scientist speaking science. walk back statements cause people doubt vaccine science. Say it’s really effective, say it’s 99%, don’t say anything data. make absolute statement? vaccine rollout started Trump back December.

Production capacity vaccines slowing US done it, J&amp;J goal 1b doses produced 2021. That's J&amp;J, year. swimming pools vaccine August. Yes correct. Anything doesn’t help corrupt crazy left cheat considered racist Michigan January peak infection levels (6500 day) shy 7000. Deaths starting increase severe levels likely hundreds per day end week. Hospitalizations high. might hear running beds oxygen soon.

There places levels Michigan reached, yet. there's guarantee avoid it. probably unavoidable people change behavior, wear masks distance. Thankfully world divided two camps. pretty irrelevant distinction. wonder though? Let’s assume certain point data definitively prove vaccinated individuals don’t spread virus worst happen little cold. refusing vaccine, people “sticking it” themselves. They’ll ones risk, it’s like refusing free umbrella storm. don’t get it. Legit. introverts enjoy spending time people, need recharge well. actively us disservice say 'I'm much happier interaction banned' conditions exist many nearby states none anywhere near poorly Michigan. Seems like there's something bigger ""no one cares anymore"" going on. No. today. I’m Easter Sunday. honestly think it’s time take break place. Israel basically conducting de facto Phase IV trial Pfizer vaccine entire population part deal government Pfizer make data available. already got mine, thanks. worried people severe allergic reactions get vaccine medical reasons. think telling sit fucking life good answer. Hopefully we'll hit herd immunity even becomes issue can't get vaccinated themselves. Offer joint funding mechanism US, offer fund parts manufacturing chain US exchange better deals, offer Pfizer manufacturers access raw ingredients exchange better deals, etc.

Canada chose go China instead. 

Good luck that. Plans Fall 2021 Although current pace vaccination promising, uncertainty prevailing conditions fall remains. predict high levels immunity, planning several Herd increasing availability vaccines vaccination requirement returning students, anticipate campuses operate fall conditions degree immunity sufficient prevent spread virus within community (herd immunity). Although New York state regulations CDC guidelines yet released, mandatory student vaccination anticipate likely scenario. science indicates extent immunity community provides safe campus operation, relevant regulations allow in-person classroom instruction, classes normally taught person return mode instruction, without routinely scheduled online option. members community – faculty, staff students – begin plan return in-person teaching learning fall 2021. also continue monitor visa travel issues might affect returning international students implement adjustments address needs much High Levels Modeling Professor Peter Frazier’s group indicates risk in-class transmission fully occupied classes equivalent de-densified classrooms long vaccination rates students, faculty, staff 50%, seating adjustments made, students faculty wear standard quality masks. continue track vaccination levels, evaluate science, carefully monitor CDC New York state guidelines; determined achieved full herd immunity, nearly faculty staff majority students immunized, begin semester normal in-person instruction without routinely provided online option, enhanced safety measures (e.g., mandatory high-quality mask wearing, special seating, additional ventilation, surveillance testing, etc.). Reasonable medical accommodations students unable return in-person instruction considered case-by-case Lower Levels Although expect case, less 50% student population vaccinated beginning semester, begin semester de-densified classrooms, mix instruction modes similar current semester, critical thresholds met. sufficient herd immunity reached, fully institute in-person classroom instruction across campuses. know enjoy social interaction, especially people already know, makes really tired need spend hours something recharge. 

Yep me. Love spending time friends fam, runs meter quickly don’t think reads way all.  Go different business kill people's family. force business make things convenient you. 
What happened government regulation bad arguments??? happened letting businesses operate see fit clientele?? lot colleges already announced they'll still mandatory masks, social distancing, even online classes next fall. Hopefully scrap they're gonna require students vaccinated. 80+ underlying health issues, prudent wear mask even without covid. simple flu kill you. Epic (not game one, healthcare one) behind MyChart hospital systems nationwide use it. 

(In case anyone curious)

You correct though, provider add pull up. Apple Health - healthcare system may already support it, pull vaccination records well. Well said. Thanks. jealous Canadian team Stanley cup almost 30 years grow lights baby! knew leaving masks dashboard something help

I actually didn't, that's convenient place put car, always remembered UV light shredded DNA Viruses DNA wrapped lipid figured something Today day 21 got J&amp;J shot! protected right now? Looking efficacy chart published trial, looks like people still catching 21-28 days, 28 days seemed really slow down.

I wondering I’m clear go favorite restaurant stadium game yet. I'm pretty sure they're asking what's point requiring students vaccinated restrictions place anyway. Novavax trial 90 percent effective strains 50 percent effective SA variant. worryingly trial found prior infection zero protection new variant. Volunteers antibody positive prior infection given placebo developed Covid rate antibody negative ones. 

If natural immunity isn’t good enough protect reinfection first gen vaccine may either. mRNA ones seem fine far vaccine evading mutation wild wouldn’t emerge 5 months society gets together mask less fashion (same thing happened first wave, originated maybe November widespread April). hopefully enough cell cross reactivity would bad cold worse that. Well one something change one isn't.. 

One discrimination not.. drawing false equivalency.

Wait, guys lick handrails public transit? Nature close. I've taking lots nice walks year. I've even nice meet-ups people outside, distanced masked. takes creativity, leant novelty offset boredom. Firepits backyard picnics whatnot.

I'm sorry tough time coping inconveniences. I'm sorry lonely. think important remember introversion/extroversion spectrum, though. People one end you, invalidate experience theirs. year COVID-19 upended life millions Americans, troubling signs coronavirus may also slowed progress another deadly health threat: Fewer smokers called quit-smoking hotlines last year smoked more, contributing unusual bump cigarette sales — middle stress, anxiety uncertainty CDC recently resumed national “Tips Smokers” advertising campaign conducting annual surveys tobacco use among adults teenagers, definitive snapshot U.S. smoking vaping. actually read original comment source added bullet point wasn’t study claimed mRNA change DNA, absolutely false.   missed April 1st, bud.  sounds like issue producing two live viral vector vaccines plant. rest true, might well produce vaccine actually use choose one. would care going countries Must protect Nard Dog. wrong.

The Oxford vaccine originally suppose produced Merck. However, Matt Hancock (Secretary State Health) refused sign contract fears USA would vaccine export bans. last minute decision change AZ. coming nurse, too? Wow. know fraud per se, made serious blunders shows given amount doubt worry countries using vaccine voiced. Also thrombosis issue, also questionable efficacy across many races ages people. Yeah, remember articles like ""tEh VaCCiNe iZ kiLLiNg pEoPL"" actually read them, medically fragile elderly people could died number things there's way could even assume vaccine caused deaths. sure pregnant? true. healthcare employers require flu vaccines order work patients hospital setting. also post sign requiring patients visitors flu shot wear mask, though idk strictly that’s enforced. Yeah, I'm talking utopia people see cases rising react accordingly. know human nature dictate policy another lockdown would harmful good. botch first lockdowns badly maybe would worked long run. think fans North division giving everyone else crap teams' Covid status.

My understanding American teams started first round vaccinations. NHL discussing bubbles post season possible North (Canadian teams) play US post season. It’s pronounced “colonel”, it’s highest rank military. assume variant analysis new variant issue here?  I've vaccine go anywhere requires covid passport. intention supporting company actively supports domestic passports. Hope CHD takes actuality AZ Pfizer 90% effective+ death 3 weeks post first dose based UKs real world data. Vaccinating 40-49 group second doses might actually beneficial said 12 weeks right stick way Michiganders go thru another lockdown. Bit late Aprils Joke, surely? That's April 2020 thinking, year COVID info data fomite transmission non issue unless licking handrails public transit COVID ward hospital... about? yeah its
pretty fucked up. sub seems like place brainfucked lil boys essentially crucify post secret cuz youd never know unless follow sub GCornell, forget silent G Boris Johnson said happen. really taken confirmation will. move away apartment Iowa parents’ house florida born chd therefore incredibly high risk virus. locked inside house since last March left cardiology appointment, absolute wearing mask, forced *extremely* cautious it. also received second dose Pfizer vaccine last week finally comfortable going outside first time year starting next week. 

But continue making assumptions complete strangers internet. I’m sure intentions pure. That’s awesome hear.

I’m guessing whoever new doesn’t realize they’re making everyone else look bad. Exactly, keep bringing point like fuck, nobody forcing shit you. wear seatbelt drive 'don't wanna', choice drive.

Absolutely right. makes seem like production stopped simply it’s AZ vaccine, isn’t case. make Americans money. Big Pharma leaning power sound right. should, targeted lockdowns way lockdowns. Michigan surge lock get cases control, Michigan surge mean, say, California instance lockdown. Thanks! helpful :) I’m happy asked. Why?  already good evidence lasting 6 months. prevent mistakes, 15 million ruined J&amp;J vaccines workers mixed AZ J&amp;J ingredients vaccine. better binding properties ACE2 Receptors therefore enter cells easily. understand, basically means, fewer virus particles neccessary cause infection.

That irreelevant suefaces business tied outbreaks worse business point, feel move makes sense. ruined doses came mixing AZ J&amp;J vaccine ingredients AZ yet approved here, risk mistake happening again? Thank breathing reason stooge know feeling. Damn near shed tear happiness. NC technically open everyone yet half counties (health departments hospitals) are. Additionally, CVS, Walgreens, &amp; Walmart checking assume lot younger group vaccinated already even technically non open states. is, reduces infection 90%, can’t spread COVID infected, even infected spread it’s mild infection. CDC never say vaccinate people ‘can’t’ spread COVID implies 100% nothing 100%, I’ll take 90% day.

Initial comment said rare, non existent, study clearly supports spread extremely rare vaccinated individuals. Nobody knows long vaccine last for. need booster shot, everyone else publicly available like now. choice contagious later, contagious never.

I laud social distancing impossible fully, entirely without human contact year. Take found anti-masker Well pretty dumb support Republican party sooo Oh agree, make sense. hate wearing masks think mandates lifted soon everyone chance vaccinated. see happening, think many places overly cautious continue require masks. Especially universities saying they'll require fall Fauci saying may necessary 2022. Michigan states reimposed mild restrictions cases could go background noise June jealous. numbers cases deal sheer number covidiots last year. Hopefully sold cost, doubt America knows unfortunately. Really surprising it’s used masks. It’s super easy manufacture Many millions.

I extremely pro-vaccine happy received moderna. arguing effective. simply true one gets serious illness. Even vaccine still important wear mask careful general point. Alright dad 50 works home brother 18 essential worker. dad get brother? Even though brother likely catch bring home? 'value brands' saving lives saving summer... Love see eh! Yep. live large city still local mandate stores still “require” them. However, cases city state plummeted, 35% people vaccinated, see unmasked people day. tons spots available week get shot anyone wants it. 

I problem someone choosing wear mask want to, knock out. say last large cities forever ridiculous sounds like wishful thinking. bit like saying,""The vaccine actually come US. comes Texas."" fast 8 times faster?

I remember sunlight killed virus fast. Young people get ill covid. risk population vaccinated need. vaccine. medical treatment federal definition. messenger rna. approved emergency authorization zero long term safety studies. Take risk young people. Hopefully cause ADE exposed wild variant next winter. know ADE zero understanding medical literature surrounding SARS vaccines.  think much worry about. true lot people around parts would prefer get Biontech, German vaccine fewer negative headlines, choice AstraZeneca Biontech 4-6 weeks, people voting feet choosing Astra now. others replying continuing miss point. ""feelings"", even was, fuck cares? mask. That's point. vaccinated whatever want, go restaurants, travel, give shit. wear stupid mask, costs *nothing*. again, piece cloth matter much people? That’s “inhibits transmission” “not infectious”

I quoted statement walked back, infected can’t transmit virus. get hpv vaccines go college, surprise Supposing hit body...with tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet, powerful light...supposing brought light inside body, do, either skin, way... “you never safe”, even logical reasoning. think sore throat known side effect. might something else going on, allergies cold something. provide contracted services require person delivery. There's literally way provide products services without going customer's facility deliver. Almost always indoors, deliveries almost always take longer 15 minutes. contractually obligated furnish services multi-year service agreements.

These products services used variety industries kept country running- manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, etc. products services companies NEED, otherwise paying pay them.

But irrelevant. jump anyone line shot. Shortly getting letter company eligibility expanded include me-I never used letter. scheduled appointments among ample openings. Long story short, taking jab someone needed more.

You troll trying push irrelevant, quite dangerous, we're honest-talking point. Jabs arms get thing quicker. That’s quite accurate. said post, particles travel things like airstreams vents. That’s “airborne” transmission. dorm/school hand-foot-mouth disease (a disease usually toddlers get playing feces) spread pretty rampantly months one point  ever update this? article almost year old. looked like pretty obese kid may susceptible.

Also young people physiological reserve means compensate early stages disease without showing much symptoms. that's true though means already sick game, rapidly decompensated days after. Pfizer shot #1 here. Day shot, reaction. Next day, sore arm. Two days after, arm still sore, lymph nodes armpits sore enlarged tender. Also fatigued general feeling ""not 💯"". feel sick feel well either. Like coming something quite. keep work though. Day 3 felt fine. Getting shot #2 2 weeks. covid people weren’t wrong first shot rough. hope second shot isn’t bad. Spring break Easter factor well.

It feels like woods wonder large events going do. wife literally works public health outreach spent years epidemiological researcher. graduate degrees hard sciences. 

After reaction vaccine said hesitant recommend people high risk. person work home minimally contact others, waiting herd immunity would better choice. daily issues since second dose shot well (she got month ago). 

I sayin forcing everyone get shot , pretending it’s fine isn’t right. 

Also saying shot isn’t bad covid doesn’t mean get shot. That’s false choice. Herd immunity state two months. 

When wife previously vaccine outreach, would say “get vaccine help protect can’t get won’t get it”. common slogan. Lmao it’s interview him. think he’s gonna portray Im badly interview intentionally? 

He’s frequently criticized many experts basically whole year. There’s plenty better sources go information caveat student show eligible vaccine state 4 week period prior semester starting, granted waiver required get vaccinated get school. I'm sure many states allowing 18+, would hole would august. Either that, change policy 50+ states point august, and/or provide appeal process. First shot Pfizer sore arm second shot make feel weather 24 hours. certainly would smoked 100 cigarettes become eligible. would certainly smoke celebratory Cigar vaccination. vulnerable vaccinated risk minimal  think got data from. 

Public Health England vaccine effectiveness report March 2021  

I see coming wrt individual risk factor transmission want second doses risk groups they're less likely able protect masks careful degree. Bummer. Wish didn’t campus Qatar. ivy league multiple campuses lowers prestige imo. putting others risk vaccinated. schools closed, gyms closed, stores closed, restaurants bars closed, sports closed, curfews, visitation limits name it, nothing helped.

Because people want more. articles like say still wear mask vaccination? bother getting people don’t believe vaccines get it? made choice. shouldn’t put life pause don’t believe science. Yup. he’s criticized frequently many experts it. He’s held high regard many experts.

To he’s almost like Scott Atlas complete side spectrum. Lacks expertise spread misinformation partial science. mean yeah definitely sensationalist don’t think intention confuse people whatever. Second shot fever felt like get flu never quite did. english Herd immunity needs 80-90% estimated. viruses need 95%. sure accounts vaccine 95% effective best already. children vaccinated long long way herd immunity. Might even get many crazy people world now. It’s definitely list well I'm appalled would support this.

O-O-Ozzy &amp; DRIX man, understand covid may contagious, justify happening right especially vaccines coming out. covid much deadlier flu. reason kills due fact vaccine spotty reporting covid-19 deaths (if interested, look document public health england go section COVID-19 related deaths). 

does I'm saying mean go flu-like numbers vaccine? one know sure, vaccines coming good amount people expected take it, expect numbers go significantly. want completely eliminate covid deaths unrealistic something never tried virus. want try police people's choice whether want get something injected them, also something never done similar viruses change? reckon change due fear-mongering university loosened rules sophomore literally immediately mumps outbreak anti-vax idiot didn’t want get shots.

This required people living dorms minimum. Would Apartheid better example? It’s mainly oxygen levels us understand. won’t admit ask oxygen levels show need (permitted space) adult wants vaccine get one, what’s rationale keeping kids locked masked? 

It seems like don’t like children much, idea society adults free socialize maskless kids (where evidence increased hospitalization death) kept masks allowed see seem like particularly pleasant society live in. true. glass treated help protect UV, tends involve coating sort. glass nothing.

Think it. green houses work glass blocks UV? literally said bad flu.  numbers wrong. Pfizer appears 90% effective asymptomatic infection, 95% effective symptomatic infection, 97% effective hospitalization (relative unvaccinated populations). JnJ 70% effective symptomatic infection 85% effective hospitalization (relative unvaccinated populations). seen data JnJ efficacy asymptomatic infection. 

You correct *majority* people hospital vaccinated. non-zero (and non-trivial) number vaccinated. Parroting people choose get vaccinated continue impacted COVID giving selfish anti-vaxxers permission slip get vaccinated. thinking needs stop. I’m quite skeptical, would kind add reliable source (in whatever language)? Send Canada Mexico. really need it.

It’s good sideline AZ. shitty company. worry kids I’ll worry mine. problem. Thanks open new sources possibly changing opinion 

 numbers vary wildly obviously COVID data still coming real time. people could fine 12 months, permanent damage. There’s also ton factors like underlying conditions, previous health, etc. just, okay realistically 10-30% chance long term issues, risk reward probably isn’t worth go dinner movie get vaccinated. think people want risk that’s (the risk infecting others another debate), think lot people looking “if don’t die you’re fine” type way isn’t entirely accurate Let’s reopen schools said... hoodwinked! least businesses refuse use passports, right?

Hopefully means concerts, movie theaters, restaurants allowed open 100% capacity. Makes sense vaccine passports restrictions place. sure ""how good news"" comments. /r/coronavirus, /r/goodnews. Yep. super easy take away citizen’s freedom enact hard lockdown citizen’s don’t actually freedom begin with. could told time last year many unvaccinated parents actually going get fatal COVID infection unvaccinated child majority adults general population vaccinated?  


The answer likely less get flu, viral pneumonia, number potentially fatal viral illnesses children. unfortunately understand Italian, know deliveries go lot next month. idiots slowing return normalcy im fully vaccinated would nice rest world hence frustration post coming condescending scientific based hopeful would fine letting rampant get natural immunity.

That's stupid reckless. Hello guys, hopefully someone America could help existential doubt have, get admission hospital contract Covid? need say ""damn feel bad"" admitted perhaps need oxygen levels certain point?

I'm asking Mexico really strict, need almost dying MAYBE put inside hospital, imagine even close US. vaccine isn’t reward though, it’s public health tool. People regularly smoke cigarettes tend worse cases COVID, goal reduce hospitalizations death. Obesity also seen sign bad habits, look significantly likely obese person severe case COVID, makes total sense prioritize  know better tracker? Temporary foreign workers exempt hotel quarantine.

lol what.  require quarantine actual Canadian citizens? could exempt non-citizens? math indeed wrong, however sentiment still stands,

both australia canada comparable several metrics, I've said. people thread chose focus the""island, smaller geographically aspect"" instead critiquing article saying, also ignoring countries like china vietnam even islands,and parts canada opted different strategy(all places mentioned article). y'all act matters australia empty space interior rather focus fact we're talking pandemic spreads person person, large cities fare worse, something disadvantage australia since major cities higher population (going memory) ""zero covid"" strategy article says strategy used vs smallpox past adapted coronavirus pandemic. argument relatively weaker border restrictions Canada iirc due low impact imported cases played covid cases,no? Kinda ironic that's what's pointed culprit. true. look trial data - participants hospitalized- neither anyone placebo group trials. data Israel showing closer 97% efficacy severe illness/hospitalization (which amazing) individuals high risk anyway. incredibly good news 100% can't wait reopen go see friends Vancouver seen years! 80 year olds, dude. protected **you** same. 

It's impossible make vaccinated people stay home. **literally unconstitutional**. Restaurants cater vaccinated people cannot ordered closed **unconstitutional** on. person quoted idiot. Cyanide cure everything never sure. one can. never 100%.

But quality life put hold year. suffering done everything asked me. going back living want now. Yep Ireland. People getting really impatient, especially toughest restrictions Europe. Even extremely covid-conscience person, find reopening plan bit cautious. looking like earliest restaurants able open mid-June they've closed since December. Got straight Bs.

Yet. schedule open schools. Why? !!! :( Congratulations America. 

I'm hoping June/July, there'll agreement quarantine-free travel UK/US we'll quite far vaccination efforts then. could weeks sun. technically use live virus, Corona Virus.

Well still supposedly democracy, fine could spoken up. 

Fact majority, although big majority, supports lockdowns. blame majority.   Required. should. long China yet. communist. prevents vast majority cases, deceptive imply effective preventing infection. Real question though: would even able get Cornell? 10 days probably safe honest. 14 extra safe far know. I've seen data Pfizer soon 10 days people.

[Belgium apparently used water cannon disperse people authorities really want understand generally transmitted. guess easier authorities say they're something turning water cannon breaking deep cleaning. 20 years!? Still long enough. Shame much? asking legitimate question. Blood clots happened vaccines far. AZ abnormally high compared Pfizer Moderna either.

This perception manipulation I'm talking about. 

Supply chain problems however agree on...AZ vaccine creators pledged keep cost, raise prices. getting widespread distribution developing nations logistics good industrialized nations.  lot different factors compared costly alternatives dude, covid deadlier flu moment due vaccines still readily available, lack immunity, widespread testing, way covid deaths accounted for. reason flu killing crazy amounts people every year due fact existing immunity, much testing, vaccines readily available. way things going vaccines becoming available people gaining immunity, soon similar flu. wrong stating? 

yes, travelled various places. england, germany, jordan, saudi arabia, lebanon, US, currently live canada. never once, remember, asked show proof vaccination, especially illness similar survival rate flu \~99% (am wrong figure well?).

how speaking misinformation? trying say situation blown way proportion. covid-19 kill people flu? yes, 100%, reasons (stated above). besides, average age people die covid-19 average life expectancy (also similar flu). narrative pushed covid-19 crazy thing super different respiratory illnesses problem. viruses mutate, respiratory viruses contagious, viruses cause illness kill people. mean start providing covid passports, crazy lockdowns expect crazy change lives. source doses received includes 466,830 delivery forecasts.

Huh? point making? sounds like agreeing can't tell. I'm sick talking lockdown vs. lockdown generic terms. things need shut fully, serious behavioral tweaks needed vaccines approved everyone everyone least access one. 

Some go back reopened initial lockdown imo apply situations still outbreaks vaccine unavailability

- visit family indoors masks brief periods instead lingering day unmasked (personal decision unmasked indoor family biggest spread contributor) also outdoor visits whenever possible
- schools open perhaps close contact sports need wait vaccine approved distributed kids
- indoor restaurant seating household appropriate distance, outdoor dining whenever possible.
-small businesse employees needed mask worked close contact. Heard many stories ""we didnt mask sanitized time"" course got sick average age death covid 80s. plenty deaths mental physical health due lockdowns aren’t covid. Shaming ppl needing take care outside “not getting covid” gotten old cost effective easiest store

AZ contract going cash vaccine, pandemic over. one announce pandemic over. already stated, want June. countries options start receive major amount AZ, vaccine sold at-cost.  


I suspect I'm going get AZ well oppose overly optimistic AZ future somehow questionable right now. Vaccines educate people protect leave that. Yup. friend mine died peru last week p1 become dominant variant. covid fall one kill him. 

We definitely keep eye variant.  thought/question: COVID boosters become annual thing, expectation side effects diminish time? people, second shot side effects fall ""rough, nbd lifetime pandemic."" COVID becomes endemic annual boosters required, see reluctance get shot people know knock couple days context pandemic. Fair enough. I’m hoping Fall, enough adults vaccinated able examine whether kids cause surge need wait vaccine them. bro actually cares ...the vaccine made. literally impossible real time study. question is, vaccine affect someone 20 30 years? can't know. certainly make predictions based it'll behave, taken account accessing risk/benefits, know sure unless real time testing. 

Source: quality engineer medical devices. People try justify real time studies ""oh know it'll behave..."" Let's go. 7 day average almost 3.1 million. New Hampshire resident agree, open letter “tourists” Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey epicenter states higher caseloads NH, ME, VT...

STAY FRAK HOME STATE, WANTED WELCOME HERE! overlooking also good selfish reasons, rather reasons benefit us all, restrictions lifted vaccinated people. Firstly economic reasons. sooner get poeple spend money better. example tourism industry depends heavily old people. 1 month business means lot. Secondly good motivate people get vaccinated. higher amount vaccinated people better prevent mitigate future outbreaks. vaccination coverage really cant high enough. think rewards getting vaccinetd (even necessary) better us. lifting restrictions biggest part here. Bavaria suck collective dicks Requiring vaccine dosn't full FDA authorization abit extreme. Government can't force anyone get it, (with emergency use authorization) even military. college allowed to? Fortunately, COVID well known respect borders. Hybrid learning definitely staying multiple reasons

1) Socially, students develop without actual interactions kids

2) Special education children need resources hybrid learning involve

3) Teachers hate passion, can't teach fast children learn well

4) Online learning encourages passive learning, active.

This ""get used it"" type deal, online education AWFUL. either rule follow, makes feel safer. majority effectiveness 2 weeks first. second dose cherry top. Enter Bill Gates funded vaccine program Pakistan vaccinated children became sick real polio. vaccines 100 % safe, least used USA EU. can't understand people fear classic vaccines diseases children get. benefit way much higher adverse effects.

Let's test mRNA years see good old vaccines. lasting enough time. Fortunately vaccines becomming available general population. Hopefully they'll available children soon, state live, adults want vaccine likely fully vaccinated summer. Possibly intentionally too. measurable effort I've noticed paint AZ vaccine bad light compared others, reason think AZ one owners pledged keep price cost/very low. course. demand runs empty expand eligibility. might sign high vaccine hesitancy need open flood gates already, Mass. now. France currently seating higher European average rate vaccination.

Tired hearing “new normal” bullshit. reason early “goalposts” seemed move aim contain virus level could control spread. 

Which failed people adhering rules fully, disorganization administration lack preparation control spread (from beginning limited control contact tracing never really caught up).

Yes, commonly referred boredom learn never say way since absolutely idea happen 6 months. vaccines hold, new surprise variant person schools fall. turns vaccines effective 6 months (highly unlikely) get new variant escapes vaccines (small chance), one going back school offices next fall.

Wave e-34.76zsy. heck lot trustworthy spelling. There’s days literally can’t bothered walk stairs check mail box Unless college campus. seems them, including ones requiring covid vaccine, covid restrictions continue rest 2021. Novavax might also get approved coming months.

There's really place plan left AZ already surplus projected is. didn’t know super spreader Kid stats always inaccurate since one mass scale surveillance testing schools least Western world knowledge. several examples schools primary driver outbreaks, ranging Israel recently UK (they everything literally shut except schools essential jobs; schools fact culprit, ***especially secondary***). 

I've wondering whether even makes sense think adolescents ""children"" comes contracting spreading coronavirus.

A lot ""children spread virus much"" theories revolved around idea children's bodies might react differently virus. kids hit puberty common pre-pubescent children young adults comes things like immune system function? absolutely thing. half importance getting one protect can't? them? Fuck em?

Having gun private medical information, false equivalency spewing fool.

Yes, right. However, right see medical information, never know whether I'm ""a danger"" first place. HIV Medical Diagnosis. 

Vaccination, like AGE, medical diagnosis. 

Why airlines allowed check vaccination, bars? idea every nation across globe saw happen UK nothing prepare, like crazy closed eyes though oh maybe different here. 

UK variant treated previous/original variants passed children suspectible live changing effects even still relatively young (diabetes, heart conditions etc). Saying 'muh freedumbs' insufferably annoying. Grow up. Shouldn’t impact life. couldn’t get way. fact bad. 3rd G20. even better considering produce any. pace Canada could first big/developped country back normal UK US. bad, meant say survival rate. around 99% r/hockey: 16 canucks officially NHL's COVID Protocol list: Boyd, Chatfield, Demko, Edler, Gaudette, Hamonic, Hawyrluk, Holtby, Horvat, Hughes, MacEwen, Michaelis, Motte, Myers, Roussel taxi squad players 18 players. aren’t recommended pediatricians anyone half brain. Metro Detroit still high mask / social distance compliance thank goodness. Went grocery store yesterday everyone masked distanced. felt pretty safe. Outside Metro Detroit however complete shit show. finished adolescent data. They'll presenting FDA next weeks. pandemic test future problems. Viruses replicate rapidly happens viral level days take decades centuries levels.

The West catastrophically failed test. bode well ability deal future problems.

In end, matter emotionally attached democracy human rights, system that's best solving future problems win competition systems. Yeah definitely see environment start feeling cramped suffocating. moved back home parents younger siblings remote work remote learning, we're top 24/7 we'd house various parts day without respective obligations responsibilities extra-curriculars things like that. Cheers dawg, home stretch. currently three effective vaccines quickly produced used potential Novavax also approved soon 

AZ likely get approved time soon conga line bone-ups suffered seems change volume hopefully immune system fluctuations article is, I'm using technical term here, load shite. Nah. Lost five days. Could smell #2 farts, great. Unfortunately came back smell got stronger. trouble flu killed 3 million people last 12 months? hear you. June best case What’s point vaccine mandate then. safety theatre. New Jersey June 2021 It’s same. Showing vaccine proof safety guest workers. 

Do complain bouncer checks weapons door? pads physically down? 

Business right refuse service anyone puts guest workers danger. don’t show proof vaccinations negative Covid tests, go somewhere else. Reminds black market handicapped parking placards problem San Francisco years ago. Parking San Francisco horrible handicapped pay metered parking. people paying $1,000 fake handicapped parking placards. joke handicapped parking spots handicapped BMW drivers only. Stop using phrase ""new normal"". really hope so. damn tired. New Hampshire opened gen pop Friday. expanded pharmacy supply Walgreens almost every pharmacy state. Governor claimed everyone least first dose memorial day. feels. almost feel vindicated people finally acknowledging reality. think author article look Israel couple minutes see “new normal” looks like 

Spoiler: doesn’t exist. widespread vaccination Israelis less reverted entirely back pre-covid life. Even masks still required, huge swathes population ignoring regulations likely dropped well all. Plus, Israeli businesses pretty much returning person well. 

There’s som segments population want new normal idea existence; it’s going happen. past year we’ve seen tremendous resistance restrictions US tons places around world. think things learn pandemic? Absolutely. Wearing face coverings sick. Mandatory sick leave. importance vaccination overall. it’s way leave use lead paint. Could call “new normal”? don’t really think so. seems like improvement society. unless want consider banning lead paint “new normal” child vaccinated, others don’t want that’s business.

But not... vaccination public health issue. unvaccinated ""your business"" unless completely isolated society, affects everyone around well. unless farmer remote area Iceland something effect, flat inaccurate. yet they're still requiring masks distancing. Great news. going take experimental drug, want shittiest one. Michigan dumbest fucking people entire world. wonder Lions still suck we're punished everyone else's sins. Oh don’t get wrong have, I’ve supermarket BBQ’s family garden last Summer restrictions lifting able - still feeling tired though, it’s mainly working home find tough, girlfriend living parents 5 adults house working home we’re forced work together bedroom... that’s mainly struggles come we’re waiting house built good there. probably research means. true, full FDA approval.

Etc. anyone wondering need doses vaccine krispy kreme donuts thing: nope, one, barely look vax card. cheers! Ive posted research, big media. affect around you.

Im boat you, similar demographic. 

Has media blow polarized it? bit yes. friends similar you, healthy middle aged younger still can't smell taste, joint issues, cant bring groceries without puffing thier inhaler. caught last OCTOBER. want that? don't. I'll *better* odds vaccine. I, everyone else, would appreciate part inprove everyone's odds getting approved vaccine. 

You really dont want play russian roulette health. Covid  well seems like repeat then: u.s. u.k. export controls prevent vaccines manufactured countries leaving them, thats theres 20 odd million stockpile oxford vaccine sitting u.s. donated part canada mexico. eu done thing, wouldve massive stockpile pfizer moderna could either sell repurpose yeah.  sorry say ""fear life"" day every day crap well trustthe experts.   experts great track record. Got 2nd two days ago. next morning headache Advil easily took care of. symptoms. New Jersey’s case rate skyrocketed March governor gave reopening choir madness. sure that’s bellwether look at. possible? getting vaccined usual wave still comes in? absolutely. april, feels like days may right done school, woods yet feel pretty damn good. sounds bit catastrphic me. Businesses going remote online pandemic many companies never go 100% remote (i.e, working home way pandemics). ""vaccine passport"" replaced document showing recent negative test, example. Asian countries already wear facemasks regular basis can't really see problem it.

Our life changed many times. example, way travel plane changed drastically 9/11. Yet are, completely adapted used it, many us even remember time flight none minimal boarding checks. think pretty naive believe life society never change expect enjoy ""normality"" planet billion us, meaning anything happen moment change everything. overweight? Passports great idea. Stop spreading misinformation, dangerous irresponsible. vaccinated, chances dying practically 0. tell age group said ready fall? Bars reason allow enter danger guest. 

Do throw hissy fit check weapons door? Exactly, showing you’ve vaccinated means you’re danger guest workers. 

Don’t want show proof? Fine, go somewhere else. left house last year? seen friends gone anything all? Even appropriate masking distancing? say agree, pesky snot nose kids stay home magnificent heroes collect full salary work home! People dropping like flies!  School learning academics also learn social human. 

You ever seen kids home schooled whole life? like talking Martians. get released wild social disadvantage academics almost become moot point. Show papers comrade normal you? February saying we’d 300-500k infections per day beginning March. Dude cartoon. course vaccinated people get infected. people previously infected. real world efficacy vaccines (all them) around 80% infection (similar protection provided prior infection) almost 100% comes severe infection (or reinfection). incredibly jealous. responded inquiry participate. think we're far away sites. think rigorous Corona response possible?

I don’t think people don’t work education don’t realize ineffective difficult virtual learning K-12. don’t really know students learn work. students transition remote person like meeting first time. saw wrote, thought, work problems solutions - things can’t see screen. Additionally, isn’t enough home support working class lower class families make work. many low income students can’t attend class regularly they’re taking care siblings, running household ect parents don’t luxury WFH. frustrates people act like virtual/hybrid learning like promising new future. It’s not, it’s last resort emergency situation needs go soon it’s safe go back traditional learning. Time EU UK negotiate together acquiring remaining US AZ stock.  know available, definitely utilized much easily teacher popping student's desk raise hand. yeah see talk friends, nowhere near same. Hell, I'm 30 struggle still. group friends would Zoom twice week active groupchat throughout last spring summer. first time actually hung together though felt like talked years. completely different hanging person. 


As example life, work team weekly meetings person since pandemic started, monthly company person meetings. They've Teams. past months we've informal outside team meetings, questions asked answered problems solved 1 year Teams meetings. 



Yes short term, stop gaps, things job. starting stretch (or already has) long term territory. Right. want license check age?!? dare you. Precisely. one reason French forced EU hold signing contracts AZ long (meaning EU wait) Macron wanted use Sanofi vaccine. Which, course, failed. Here’s issue, lockdowns don’t actually work. slow spread yes unless people vaccinated contract they’re temporary. dunno vaccines going Quebec hear it’s going well Ontario one friend lives there. I’m right across border apparently approaching 40% county vaccinated, said like 7%. Regulating business within authority although overstep invasion rights businesses, Florida right idea. requiring vaccines FDA approved made available everyone. require sooner would create group second class citizens young healthy eligible vaccine yet It’s matter opinion perhaps, although it’s personal preference topic that’s unrelated personal preference. saying something vaccine rollout stats, would probably adding something relevant discussion (although depends exact comment).

I think there’s reddiquette document somewhere site guidelines upvotes downvotes used for. Woner required photo id like mine did....just sayin Oh went back dentist months ago lol So, study vaccinate one group, wait months vaccinate group compare transmission rates goal determining Moderna lowers spread covid. figure transmission rates participants? Contact tracing? That's good point, total drop interest disregard virus vaccines rolling real ""eff you, got mine""

I mean, stop halfway cleaning mess call job done. consolation depending country, there's routine testing catch many cases, even so, we're going feel awful long term effects covid children turn substantial thought could done keep safe. realistically impact different populations differently, namely younger people dying mass like elderly were. elderly vaccinated younger people able make decisions?

I bought water pick electric toothbrush help get year without dentist appointments. another months go! probably should. office temp checks us wait car. look one that’s that; thanks letting know that’s something offices doing! They’re virtue signaling. Don’t even pay mind.  listened Dr. Osterholm guy TV warning “category 5” surge infections due new variants. rolled eyes. Zero covid even possible unless act super early like new Zealand did. Small nuance - 80% effective asymptomatic infection. anywhere 85-90% effective symptomatic infection depending data looking at. 

Without doubt, one dose Pfizer/Moderna better one dose JnJ. hit two weeks recently materially changed behavior, sense paranoia infection dropped like rock knowing antibodies coursing body. 'old' normal return eventually, whether like not. thing depressed. Stalled. Stuck. cant take much more. Same, I'm sick bars demanding government ID worth, hair salons found significant spreader, especially parties involved wearing PPE. dentists office. even effective valuable person learning.

I agree K-12 ideal virtual, true general sense. I've teaching virtually since pandemic even started, say work effective valuable would person false (and know I've done both). like in-person learning, depends heavily teacher. There's definitely production ramp-ups incoming US worldwide. going get worse. congested living conditions going really drive numbers up. went shitty office. office allow anyone waiting room without mask, staff masked, waiting room hardly full ask patients wait cars, temperature checks taken staff patients....try different office. started smoking lockdown last year gave last month. never regular smoker, like half cig day, enough made feel worse. Weird sources page post source Ontario's received number. wrong %, number yesterday inputed wrong, 40.1 41.1. seems inputed totals today really demographics Indiana opened lowest vaccine rate midwest.

The fact Massachusetts opening means demand incredibly high good. First hanging could get vaccine. vaccines given unprecedented pace pretty close end, although think always Covid cases still spreading around. 

But people vaccinated ever see huge hospital numbers deaths like last year, probably localized thing people still requiring distancing masks; dont think we'll entire states countries locking down. mandate seatbelts drivers licenses.... same. BC feels like shit show inconsistency. it!! Kids kept home last year adults quarantined locked necessary. many adults caught virus already.

Now start vaccine program. gets vaccine? Adults.

Who left vulnerable? Kids.

This common sense. immunized adults previous infections number adults bound less, even catch strain may asymptomatic depending previous infection whereas kids could still susceptible it.

As far distance learning. I’m blessed good memory tell even far back kindergarten I’d done absolutely anything avoid school related work. guarantee anyone far along high school doesn’t want participate finding ways bork sign ons zoom calls watch movies, play video games simply participate all. one friend teacher, sees every day. shit. moving targets aren’t helping either. preaching choir. Covid bucket list. Things going hit two weeks second dose two days ago. Going movie best friend. Visiting several museums. Dinner wife favorite restaurant. No, wear mask since costs nothing! shouldn’t big deal yeah shouldn’t take pain relievers unless absolutely need to. trials though 26% people got Moderna also took Tylenol vaccine still found 94% effective food security one important things terms keeping country stable, farmers cant get food ground onto table, effects everyone. also food stamps effective tool Enjoy dinner :) think SA following trend wave we’ve seen across world last year. cases rise things suppressing stop whether that’s: state intervention, people naturally staying home, weather etc. 

It’s suppressed due successful vaccination program. 

I think world freaking AZ vaccine is/was supposed vaccine 3rd world it’s uncertain. Locally US worried for, agree, wrong reasons. 1-on-1 help easily available virtually, many teachers utilize already. also see talk friends video chat. agree aspects school same, also disingenuous act like there's replacement things short term. agree. add potential customer I'll refuse go there.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Maybe get vaccine Try it’s cool check What’s alarming number people saying wear masks protect children. It’s approved yet. realize kids don’t get sick, do. I’m vaccinated adults living normal life, going events, even going without mask bar show kids. seems like really small thing ask wear mask grocery museum kids also safely go resume normal life. I’m shocked number adults won’t so. elementary teacher, fully anticipate wearing mask work next school year protect students, even don’t wear one gathering vaccinated adults. interesting effect coming years factory-location decisions critical industries. multi-national working in, instance, med-tech, lightly choose locate EU bloc may use regulations intended wartime use sieze infrastructure, block completing contracts made accordance EU law?  Grab popcorn real time study study extrapolated later time points. reality vaccines adverse reactions basically occur soon vaccination. BTW term pharma stability. know use clinical trials though.

Perhaps wait long term study effect covid infection deciding safe people skip vaccine? reason lack long term info okay okay vaccine? me, one unconstructive things happened last year headlines amplified generalized observation wild type mutating much (yet). Turns (yet) important detail, threw caution wind far much. indeed rational people concern mutation. indulged cautious approach taken precautionary principle. Nice! think start see FEMA step everywhere sites too. I'm lucky NC. I've fully vaccinated two weeks now. kids come back spring break I'm fully vaxxed. I'll 100% too. longer feel worried health. classroom management 8 week reunion tour. Yep, percentage seems lower, think denominator ""total adults US"" seems higher. 

103.5 / 41.1 = 251.1 M

103.6 / 40.2 = 257.7 people already it. case privileges not. private meetings know do. point could allow small family friends meetings. Illegal large group meetings easier spot. businesses, risk big respecting rules. news actually get worried. local soccer club doesn’t require kids wear masks playing, kids don’t wear one. Last fall single case COVID among kids players. seems B117 spreading among kids, might see cases rising. 

Should keep kid home couple weeks vaccines received 4/3 start effective? Haven’t caught yet, dead baby tragedy he/she died covid. Otherwise, cares :/ get results appt... Reschedule safe?

I can't believe FAQ it! got giant coffee way home mine. least Canada rise clearly traceable rising prominence B117. sequence results regularly track % cases known variant B117 rising quickly. think 1/3 cases something like variant hit new peak ICU cases Ontario. preregistered state. Waiting appointment age group get vaccinated. specific, tell us gene something specific affected? used like going bars beer nachos. I've much outdoor restaurant year. go first shot. Another weeks feel safe go newfound feet I'd totally hit establishment up. agree, can't put CDC point. They've updated messaging reflect accurate science, still plenty people continue spew misinformation they've invested much time believing falsehoods. people tell listen experts, soon experts disagree stance, they've got excuse. sounds reasonable. vaccinated friends family? masks. store? give little longer. clearly understand role US UK-sourced precursors vaccine creation process. interdependence. mean, I’m still hearing people citing 90%+ numbers too. exact number/percentage effectiveness we’re getting moment really point I’m saying conceptual idea. Again, especially light rapidly developing variants easily push vaccine effectiveness different ways. Good thing kids back school. take Tylenol second shot unless to. pharmacist gave shot said take Tylenol bed night did. still ended getting symptoms 24 hours later I've reading they're advising people take pain relievers could mess immune response. wish pharmacist telling people shot. 🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻 Ok ok. b. person refuses buy toothpaste 9 10 dentists recommend 10th one shills snake oil. grandpas neighbors whole family got Covid wildly different symptoms. back November IIRC, mother family still sense smell February. havent talked recently I'm sure got back yet, even losing sense smell taste many months sucks.

And cousin still gets breath easily take rest pushes hard physically. year originally sick. Pfizer ""approved"" anyone yet. makes think adolescents soon? 90 minute drive fine. usually takes hours fever fatigue kick in. two hour drive way mine, later night get bit tired bit sore arm. hope rates stay there. hope atleast 70% get vaccinated. Hopefully less anti vaxers I’m hoping household (and especially dad) calms little Grandma getting second dose tomorrow.  believe saw scotland schools opened. bad learn. ask bell tolls, ask strain killed guy.

So far ""the spread"" mutations beyond average means one single thing - lighter host, faster legs.

That's ""rises"" 

It turns trivial cold.  Well teacher knowing particular parents would probably find hundreds things complain people would assigned take care children. disagree inconsistent messaging, think people reasonable (I'm even scientist) figure end pandemic near, we'd rather somewhat cautious getting finish line try sprint, trip, fall. Someone’s parent could die car accident way pick kid school, too. Better go remote forever, “safety”.  know use live even inactive SARS-CoV-2, adenovirus vector inactivated? Well put! I'm sure lot people wear make others feel comfortable, think much ""science"" confirming effectiveness covid. Imagination Library gives kids one free book every month birth age 5. son recently aged out, huge library fantastic books now. great program. books chosen suitable child based age includes diverse protagonists. dude's Florida, *course* he's outraged people forced wear shirts. Yeah, really tried supply lockdown, go pretty much anything. category businesses closed besides supposed go certain radious ""without valid reason"". Opening distribution equal fast vaccine rollout. 6th fastest state terms % population ""get vaccine go back normal"" downvoted? fuck happening? Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

That one really hits home me. callous attitude see towards others - ""cull weak"" type stuff actual humans went HS 80s.. people go Church, really made take lot intentional effort close social circle toxic people. 

Especially relevant seeing people really disparage people making vaccines literally saving us pandemic, cringeworthy, nasty, ""being mean sake mean"" ugliness.

We need start working vaccine malignant narcissism. Sounds unconstitutional. It’ll probably blocked court soon. NBC wrong comes national data piece. [Per 40% adults gotten first dose 23% completed (although people 18+ NM looking people 16+).

My guess graphics designer old data US first dose number, fully vaccinated numbers appear use count people 16+ NM total population US denominator, making differences much starker actually are.

I absolutely agree NM great! numbers using apples-to-apples. Nah, I’m good.

If aren’t able see privilege got little teddy today complete idiot, that’s sweetheart. Yes article misleading. way law enforcement works Spain regional level region police force control (simplifying). regional governments saying nothing changing nothing changes. 
I live Valencia no-one wearing mask beach weekend. Plenty police tho. know man. Feels like pace Sweden right never over. vaccinate weekends, vaccinate holidays, combined 30k vaccines distributed day actually it.

Don't mean sound like hater I've kinda given point. California variant, think there's New York variant. I’m finding article provided link. Anyone found updated source? actual studies ""high quality""? fucking joke. kind bullshit censorship this?  get that's unfair toward young, ""I can't X can"" ""neither us can't X"", I'd rather first option good reason can't X.

Until enough people vaccinated, would like grandma freedom back instead uselessly locking down. fair, North Dakota run dumbest people entire country. Source 1: grew nearly bad today. Source 2: still friends there. Source 3: look recent article anything passed legislature. explain people getting vaccinated somehow considered bad thing encouraged employer so.

To put simply: employers want employees getting sick call-outs reduce productivity. agree that. think employees want get sick call out? likes sick? 

Employers encouraging employees get vaccinated marriage employers interest employees. groups want thing, would illogical *not* encourage it.

It's honestly unbelievable I'm even discussion anybody 2021 plexiglass obviously helps prevent coughs sneezes from, um, well wearing mask, guess, oh christ none makes sense. Lol People going accuse fear mongering, like, going happen point. Even rare, many orphans acceptable level? hate governors figured opening vaccination wider groups trick constituents thinking state well vaccine distribution without actually anything improve distribution. Exactly, that's say I’m going legitimize hysterical dystopian fever dream continuing respond this. Bye lot secondary workers well. Hospitals nursing homes large maintenance/food service/ect staff. Many people work low income housing elderly well. think that's right.
 stuff like make people say Americans superiority complex. again, vague “rising among younger groups” “increasing numbers”, along “633%!” “800%!” actual numbers many young people actually ending seriously ill. Spoiler alert: it’s many, we’ve putting millions vaccines high-risk people months now. 

(But don’t let stop fear-mongering!) article, it’s unlikely we’ll know exactly DPA used for, used 18 times Trump six vaccines benefited one way another. realize thread Germany right? Yeah, worst need smoke couple smell like walking ash-trays typical chronic smokers. lockdowns circuit breaker extremely fierce anything. Can't 5 months equilibrium also hospitals filled. Either lockdown shortly fiercely it. Appropriate someone lives fantasy world would reply fantasy reference. country panic

nothing closed… gyms bars malls… kids don’t go school meet remote schooling without masks… it’s useless lockdown year cigar... get violently ill, remember smoke. need step away Palantir, Denethor good thing B117 strain that’s effectively neutralized vaccines use. Obviously cases bad thing overall, it’s “AstraZeneca South Africa” thing. Moderna two doses. Second dose friday. serious fatigue times 36-48 hours. I'm starting feel better. likely mild case Covid last July. Likely strongest side effect vaccine remember still beats Covid. 

My wife J&amp;J even sore arm. Comparatively strong side effects Shingles vaccine none. TIL vaccinated 37% population instead 33% New York somehow makes Massachusetts ""so far behind"" New people want high percentages Disinfectant changes taste still prefer without risk lie take vaccine catch tetanus, measles, covid, flu, etc? police choice impact anyone person makes it? article Guardian says otherwise: he’s also trying whatsoever total dumbass.

""dangerous"", exactly dangerous? telling anyone get shot? No. telling companies trying get employees front line care employees. Sorry break you. Spoiler alert. easter bunny put eggs yard kid either. Strong healthcare history, strong education rates, several major hubs science (especially Boston) contributing higher community belief vaccine success, plus NE (especially CT) got hammered hard first wave definitely enticed folks Yep, keep forgetting got elected somehow Yeah believe europe notion half measures we'll equilibrium economy health system unfortunately, exponential growth fallacy. Untill vaccines, zero covid way imo assume everyone without mask unvaccinated third country vaccinated? please spout bullshit line ""there's 1 billion chance could still spread covid even vaccinated risk high"" What’s resource rich people lot used anything like tutors, grades, etc?

You must know “educated” means Donny Cruz aren’t educated regardless grades. infrastructure need body. completely true. ingredients vaccines cause reactions people allergic. Obviously, see doctor figuring vaccine works best, blanketly state vaccine completely safe argued misleading dangerous. Another good reason wear mask.... good example others making last strides towards herd immunity.

I live SF, vaccinated, still wear mask outside, fear getting COVID - even think capable spread outside... want polite people help feel even bit comfortable passing street.

Same reason fart elevator. Yes, legal... but... matter whether good reason. fact remains choice want something injected body not. store government requiring proof vaccination undermining choice sets dangerous precedent. seems reasonable stance

It's right stance someone charged health entire nation family and/or friends. mean, I’m talking risk going too. there’s way know someone’s vaccinated, sure it’s safe? know someone talked president university (large state school) said currently allowed make vaccine mandatory students (I think vaccines fully FDA approved yet), are, plan make vaccinations required attendance. chance Covid already? friend mine — sick January — similar reaction first Moderna shot. heard existing antibodies, vaccine likely produce stronger reaction. please keep within borders please right prioritisation 30% vaccine rollout eliminates essentially deaths good chunk hospitalisations. also reduces effective R quarter potential hosts removed. 

The U.K. saw month back disease rapidly suppressed seeing almost 60% adults dose. suspected cases actually false positives! kind admonition would worked time last year, doesn’t anymore. Sorry people go back normal whether moral grandstanding likes one them! arm hurts getting vaccinated choice

It choice want travel internationally.

If aern't date TDAP/MMR traveling internationally anyway. Mask outside almost useless. I'll never wear beach. Agree experimentation good. reason we’re seeing fast vaccine rollout due experimentation around approval process. experiments paid off, didn’t, it’s hard tell ex-ante be. bit trial error good. Netherlands, unfortunately. it’s fine. don’t make american get vaccine booklet like whole fucking world one..

Except Americans get order go one countries.

I feel like absolutely idea talking about. banned in-state companies requiring them, nothing international travel. Good News? one charging market prices covid vaccine, they're basically cost. AZ vaccine inherently cheaper manufacture transport. survival rate college aged people would attend Cornell something like 99.9% definitely couple months. I'm pro vaccine passport delusional lol  Stop immature selfish. Grow up. Accept change, whether like come, life like before. got vaccine, feel want need get it. vaccine protects others virus shows protect cares someone else get it? long enough people get vaccine fine want never forced get one Guys, downvote garbage posts like this. Actually report misinformation. one thing mods tends okay here. dont get piece paper anyone print up. cards treated official govermenet documents I'm france, ? US number one economy earth. highest standard living country large. important country diplomatically run NATO, influential alliance Earth. last bit important, MAKES US 1ST WORLD COUNTRY DEFINITION.

1st world LITERALLY MEANS ALIGNED WEST. STILL LEADER WEST SINCE WORLD WAR TWO

So SHUT US 3rd world. it’s fine. don’t make american get vaccine booklet like whole fucking world see happens anyone wants travel outside US. +3.37M according Cyrus Shahpar. Here. Here, are. 

Our lockdown much severe still shit. Lockdowns answer. prime directive Republican Party maximize cash flow businesses. become deranged contrarian anti-mask vote suppression policies starting harm businesses working for. That’s goig turn well GOP.  Long term effects rare. substances world cause long term effects small dose. long term effects caused repeated exposure harmful substances. amount vaccine getting small two doses. highly doubt use anything vaccine severe cause long term effects. improbable.  80-90% world like this. needs specific reason… look many countries third fourth waves people dumb understand microfabric filter front air intake holes work…

same people this. reason would one ever getting vaccinated? Answer question. somehow race people vectors disease like this, would acceptable discriminate exclude society? common explanation I’ve read produces higher viral load, meaning maybe og version would produce let’s say 100k virus particles every infected cell, P1 variant would produce 530k. (I made numbers up.)

So every breath expelling much virus air. 

In addition that, spike protein affinity ACE2, meaning bonds easier, bonds harder.

So addition virus body, virus air, virus particle higher success rate attaching cells. I'm introverted, work home thing best. even got promotion training, phone calls, etc way easier one around watching listening. looking forward returning office. summer probably vaccinated expected back physically. Though personally, think pointless. spend less utilities, insurance, food, etc. waste 2 hours plus day driving. buy gas. eat food kitchen. I'm productive ever, so. vaccinated still wear mask science isn’t yet. vaccine gives body ability fight virus. science isn’t whether contagious fighting said virus. like going parties prefer party friend group small big, example. drained feel... depends. times others. ever hit face football? Yeah. People southwest US border know this. border counties fairly poor average lots movement everyday across US/Mexico border. could see major Mexican towns outbreaks spill US. one reason Zero Covid US almost impossible task. would convince Mexico lock down, country government corruption giant black market sorts things possible Seriously sad problem normal people dying, cartels would cheering ones getting vaccinated.?..Mexico really tough time hopefully America realises important stable country southern border  helping destroy cartels would cut number people trying cross border 80 percent. America cannot hell military getting trillions every year. lmao right? ex stationed Japan first thing learned Japan actually tropical af. person obviously know they're talking about. like hanging people mind (except I've spent parents). pressure socialise constantly, FOMO, etc lifted felt great. things going back normal that's coming back I've shell year, much difficult overcome meeting friends. keep repeating shit again. Biden goal get accomplished 40,000 pharmacies administering vaccine April 19th definitely reaching goal hopefully getting 4 million people vaccinated day. getting supply even setback plant Baltimore made J&amp;J vaccine. mental health gotten least 5x better since home office Pfizer Moderna seem effective enough one dose. see reason believe would much different practice J&amp;J three make body target spike protein use stabilized protein. said, means saying switch one-shot strategy, could wrong. maybe they're repainting walls cleaning really smelly cat's litter box. There're still good reasons wear masks! thread joke. **middle** transition lockdown social distancing measures, end it. 

People going squander progress declining cases deaths meet someone indoors weeks earlier would allowed anyway. stupid. We're one countries closer doorway whole pandemic most, like always people insist know best, catch covid. could mean requires less viral load cause infection. It’s bad say loud, Covid gave perfect excuse I’ve always looking get social activities. Michigan? Please tell going there? local news saying? causing it? Exactly. always say people watch read media concerns topics person expert on. see much media gets wrong it’s area expertise. Nice job heard CDC, [this one study British says prior infection conferred 95% immunity - best vaccines - long followed nurses.

There's lot movement states. Also, would though coordinate since every province measures. 

I wish could though, heart. September long way off, can't vaccinate fast enough. Definitely think someone’s infected. They’ve big gatherings pandemic, never masks. odds finally caught them. You’re God’s work. look comment every single day. suspect number like would kept wraps good while.   jealous US vaccination strategy though. Despite 150M doses administered US, 31% adults received first dose daily death count still lingering around 1000. could done lot better. 

Has Canada adopted first-doses-first strategy?  Nice job! Congrats Congrats Genuinely asking, introverted party animal work?

Oh god it’s year already Could household member infected? maybe visitors? I’ve felt mildly guilty wonderful covid mood. also absolutely dreading end shut things return “normal.” Can’t keep things like this?!

Wut? wonder “improvement” consistent among introverts live alone. Great job! cdc gave stat chance re-infected? Well us prefer science, us prefer Darwinism suppose. Herd immunity either way think they'll pretty much case. can't say much sympathy. that's line work, likely expected protection catching spreading disease. long extroverts remember felt lockdown force introverts adapt extroverted lifestyle (i.e. making mandatory go back office, attend pointless meetings etc.) we're cool. 

That's people mainly getting here, minus folks shut-ins/want extroverts miserable. pseudo freedoms Idk, bomb iraq something? literally never made appointment flu vaccine. Walgreens offers I’m buying batteries whatever. see neighbors masked home...😬

Time stay faaaaaaaaar away house. Whether like not, US another wave. 4 million people got vaccinated yesterday. 

It doesn’t matter like not. pandemic ending. Good God, idea... I’ve WFH + Sheltering Place pandemic long. guess never occurred might really sheltered what’s going there. didn’t know anyone could go get test basically reason. 50% people 65 vaccinated Texas. Compared 75% nationally.

Texas quite literally fucked. similar amount daily cases US people screaming open up, telling everyone people’s lives don’t matter vaccine lower numbers later. faith humanity grows thin. too. wanna go crowded bar dance woman half age and/or eat nachos. #lifegoals2021 Hey, give guy break. two. agree.

I''m passport everyone flies even domestically. Dolly national treasure, culture hero great artist. tell really feel? Bravissima Dolly! Interesting. 2 months, let's say 61 days (30+31). Today 3rd April.

So 2 months Thursday, 3 June 2021.

Israel US currently 24th January terms first doses total population. 61 days date Friday, 26 March 2021.

So let's see results US achieved 3rd June comparing Israel time frame.

Israel % changes 24th January 26th March:

* 96.7% increase share population least first dose
* 305.3% increase share population that's fully vaccinated
* 89.6% reduction number cases per day
* 51.6% reduction effective reproduction number
* 77.7% reduction number deaths per day
* 82.1% reduction test positivity
* 65.9% reduction hospital occupancy
* 41.1% reduction ICU occupancy

So look like US Thursday, 3 June 2021?

* 59.9% (around 200 million first doses given) total population vaccinated least first dose
* 52.9% (around 176 million full vaccinations given) total population fully vaccinated
* 6,720 cases per day (7-day rolling average)
* 0.50 effective reproduction number
* 189 deaths per day (7-day rolling average)
* 1.2% test positivity (7-day rolling average)
* 11,723 COVID-19 patients hospital
* 4,880 COVID-19 patients ICU

Israel vaccinating 2.09 vaccine doses per day (7-day rolling average) per 100 people 24th January, US currently sitting 0.89. certainly still long way go.

I another remind running said region done vaccinating end year. said could done much earlier. recent projections show everyone first dose end June, seems winning one. bit unsure actually play out. Israel rise cases happened, like US currently.

RemindMe! 61 days Flair checks out. Oh yes 100% necessary change, unfortunately would even harder massive 20% exodus employees refuse get shot. Overall situation terrible one sadly.  Well, R. R0 new population prior infections. says one replying weeks old comment Many people Covid bad side effects 1st dose 2nd dose. didn’t covid often easy 1st dose hard 2nd dose. 

Take 2nd dose. That’s tested proven effective.

LBH masks flames Memorial Day, people cracking lose sooner later. UNLIMITED POWER!!! don’t care people decide personally wear masks, hell permanent mandates. Breakthrough cases cases come vaccinated people. probably wasn’t clear lingo deaths level vaccination shows 84 percent Israel’s COVID deaths February hadn’t received second vaccine mean vaccines amazing, people gotten covid died fully vaccinated. I'm college student, get tested weekly. Certain jobs also similar testing requirements, others require testing close contact. Maybe miss read you?! BC Canada 🇨🇦is world epicenter P1 variant. can’t fire government workers. Even horrible.  fair point, cumshot_josh Almost opposite.

We know UK testing much, much, countries. first time detect variant, region direct connection rest europe rest world. Sounds like likely scenario prevalent europe, undetected testing, turns UK detected port entry.

If first turned in, say, mid-wales, would much better case arising indigenously. Two things

1) supporter federal government.

2) enough nonsense fault. It’s lie anyone familIar situation knows it. Again. fan government. literally bought every vaccine could. way hell somehow dictating terms Europe US must smoking something strong think Andrew flipping Scheer could negotiated anything better. Dude like overripe potato minus charisma. plenty criticize Feds ain’t it. states much vaccine hesitancy anti-vaxxers afford open eligibility early demand isnt there. isnt true states however, states high demand enough supplies meet it. simple, states opening eligibility vaccines available first place Yes. completely logical sick person would wear mask public, especially public transport.  Uhm. specifically mentioned Michigan “responsible”. far truth fact checked, course, censorship name game skew dialogue.  comment section nothing shut-ins using study justification evil extroverts. hate talking people ever leaving house you’re introvert. You’re asocial probably need therapy. difference liking crowded house parties literally never leaving house See Israel he's talking about. What’s point? wrong suggest ""young women's lives traded"" present established fact without evidence.

 inappropriate, harmful perpuates anti-vax sentiment. spreading fear, uncertainty doubt without requisite evidence support claims. data UK support hyperbolic conspiratorial version events, absence existing inappropriate jump conclusions. 

Now perfectly fair want see data broken age gender; there's nothing wrong mentioning even one emotional topic facts simply know demographics individuals affected UK been.

you cannot extrapolate countries reporting assume there's direct overlap imply there's cover ongoing. UK historically broken vaccine deaths presented specific granular data ages, ran present n=1 events frontpage media information known obviously taken account compared number immunized specific groups 

If pattern risk, would suspended based specific demographics even entirely. Till latest information clearly stated line EMA: vaccine overall considered safe age groups Benefits outweigh risks. case back December, hospital workers largely took holidays administer vaccines. 

The key difference private industry military heavy lifting. Interesting considering wife got severely depressed considers introvert got extremely happy considered (by her) extrovert. I'm intovert ADHD found Covid slower less mentally intensive hate large crowds miss social distancing know moan lived life without social distancing got it. people struggling one year wise up.

2. Regardless, change title. intending alter title misleading anything, shouls zero qualms using actual titles, verbatim.

Moving on. Yes would safe. Go there. fun. disagree completely factual arguments doesn’t mean they’re batshit??? 

You’re objectively wrong. Plenty businesses, governments, etc continue require proof vaccinations. People like like believe sudden political move left covid vaccination, it’s not.

Stop spouting bullshit morally bankrupt fuck. Masks, yes. It’s common countries helps. Yes. We’re aggressive UK allowing 4 month interval doses get everyone first dose.  Hopefully though actually need 4 month delay though whoever reported comment - he's factually accurate, stop it. Exodus would absolutely improve front line pay. Homes would forced hire staffing agencies cost far more, offer higher higher pay attract workers cost less staffing agencies employees. end massive reduction labor pool cause competition employees leading raising salaries. would little address Admin pay much touch that. know big Australia is. population crammed around coast lot nothing middle Stop embarrassing commonwealth, Canada. title misleading.. really. Treat mother's room like hospital ward (even about) nurse. PPE would healthcare worker wearing - that's what's appropriate you. Absolutely wear eye covering close her. Keep window open improve air flow practical. 

At home place mostly like catch COVID19 said that, secondary household transmission round 16% sleeping room, possible avoid infection. take things carefully. see business opportunity? Pharma working future things time. It’s strange. It’s comments repeated again. variation of: “No, part. wore mask, socially distanced, worked home, didn’t see friends family year. I’m vaccinated I’m going wear mask anymore.” borderline feels like bots coordinated brigading. 

You’d think someone things year would wear mask public couple months. Everything else go back normal. act like they’re asked lockdown 2 months. people basically living lockdowns long time *before* March 2020, lockdowns basically utopia - heroes “sacrificing” socialization bunch stuff hadn’t years anyways. won’t give easily. Despite (deliberately ?) Leaving china also mentioned article think y'all know Large australia is...sure taiwan,nz iceland way smaller geographically australia comparable canada though...infact entire continent...and also comparable population density... suppose happens lump words small islands together without much thought post digress. think 4 weeks begin see major reduction. shall see. great movie Canadian hope know Atlantic Canada much smaller population much smaller cities harder hit provinces... think know CDC study referring to. misinterpreted misreported on. Dr. Walensky said vaccinated people carry virus, would discussion,' said John Moore, virologist Weill Cornell Medicine New York.

""'What know vaccines substantially effective infection — there’s data — nothing 100 percent,' added. 'It important public health message needs gotten right.'"" 30 years keeping mask purse weird granny thing. Hopefully 🙏 Yes. Absolutely. socially acceptable reason public transportation wear mask wanted years. would suggest go boss try little succinct feedback. mean know masks? Prove wrong  Conclusions
In cluster COVID-19 cases, little transmission occurred asymptomatic case-patients. Presymptomatic transmission frequent symptomatic transmission. many search preaching choir mate hate Tory's. I'm saying specific thing bad shit haha Ok, you’ll minority still complaining people selfish time it’s likely anyone get vaccine choose. care want do? I’m forcing anything Realized first 6 months COVID extrovert. busy professional pre covid socialize ton, thought introvert need it.

Recently went group hangout 2 weeks post 2 vaccine shots honestly felt like pure joy vibe energy people room, makes sense. Talked probably ten people absolutely nothing. pandemic bubble one friend point stopped seeing second lockdown, literally felt like energy recharging. one. zero percent miss loud, non stop blabbering. Hope wasnt taxpayer funded study. already require fire them.

But like people lining work shit jobs shit pay. *dream*. German firm BioNTech says track manufacture 2.5 billion doses Covid-19 vaccine year, boosting producion capacity facility Marburg, Germany.

2.5 (or 3 billion) combined yearly capacity Biontech Pfizer. capacity Marburg plant boosted 750 million 1 billion.

Journalism ... Erm, isn’t “airborne”. 

And it’s easy avoid normal household situation. 

The secondary attack rate Covid household 15-20 percent. seem completely evade number one factor Florida total chaos. Climate/Humidity. Every single place earth warm humid climate well Covid. Florida Brazil worst among them. obvious reasons. Stop comparing Florida places like NY California, compare places like Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan see real difference. Florida climate terribly Covid. really think going put virus behind us? 

Sure...the developed world get vaccinated short term..mean while, 3rd world not. 

The virus bounce around hundreds millions people, mutate return.


Boosters needed. 


Over again. 

Sooner later suspect live threat base everything available hospitals beds. Probably reason they've reticent opening things fully-vaccinated people: rollback could start chain measure removals beyond appropriate. Makes one wonder strong correlation self awareness introversion.

My gut tells introverts likely focused thoughts feelings therefore self aware, could bias.

I say someone firmly fit either category. I'm fine socializing like conversations, also need time alone often not. find us!!! absolutely! *And done?*

- Asian parents everywhere assume Operation Warp Speed beginning demanded US funded production facilities used US vaccines first.

BioNTech/Pfizer part Operation Warp Speed. seen source says contracts require doses global distribution vaccine come factory Puurs, Belgium. consequence US banned exports December. That’s masks aren’t worn places Covid spreads, like homes. 

Even Michigan, it’s believe spread taking place private gatherings, especially get togethers children. Oh people liked go outside sad forced stay vice versa? Amazing ability execute arbitrary code within human cell. code currently write ""build protein""; concept compiled even assembly language, barely even know machine code works. we're par building computer crack enigma code. Would anyone possibly predicted changes computers caused?

The demo program mRNA (executed mice) created protein causes bio luminescence. therefore livers muscles glow dark.

Creating vaccines instantly virus known protein antigen achievable (figuring virus's target antigen instant, quickly test candidates). Curing viruses, rather vaccinating them, seems obvious next step. Writing code create mimic cancer antigen get immune system hunt cancer cells seems horizon, whether done without overly complicated programming unknowable try it.

We also delivery limitations; might compared card-punch era computing. program must frozen (refrigeration available within months), executed injection site (hence use injection muscle, since tissue regenerates constantly) liver (where particles enter bloodstream filtered out).

Conspiracy theories aside, absolutely safety concerns. ability write complicated programs, malware attacks become certainty. fundamental misunderstanding efficacy means clinical trials run. Cancer treatment, first results 2 years according Biontech CEO. Interesting. main drivers? think missed point, friend.

They pointing extrovert friends waited bare minimum comfortable temperature start hanging outside together.

Some folks feel compulsion person socialization others do. put little mask penis expose public. Masks sign RESPECT. youngest son Aspergers wife started doctorate become epidemiologist yr ago. gets work home helped develop Pfizer vaccine. 2 people know thrived past year. get sold it. unfortunately ones living here. Giving half truths taking extremely conservative approaches huge unintended consequences range people trusting gov. Institutions job loss. think it’s fair ask questions gov approach hereZ love pointless study! I’m typically introvert. enjoyed lot quarantine, winter started going nuts. 

I’m home mom right respect caution her, really didn’t much go (outside groceries, etc) started going nuts winter. I’ve got shot I’m starting see people again. Even took road trip, mood drastically improved It’s anti mask. literature review - note studies suggesting correlation site infection mask wearing could, arguably, biased even apply contemporary surgical practice. 

What they’re really indicating read AVAILABLE literature found recent studies likely can’t used say masks bad.

“The study concluded ‘it unclear whether wearing surgical facemasks members surgical team impact surgical wound infection rates patients undergoing clean surgery’. However, studies included could criticised risk bias (Table 2). Indeed, Webster study, arguably rigorous three, investigated impact mask non-scrubbed members surgical team. uncertainty whether findings studies applicable contemporary surgical practice.” Well..right bat told us masks work. 

Now saying wear even fully vaccinated ""science"" really means law order. 

Dude even admits lies sake expediency. dat creampie friend works Salesforce WFH half decade. closed call center started them, liked enough keep remote stuck.

I think companies need wake new paradigm. likely spending millions annually keep people campus ""monitor"" them.

Look productivity. Cut underperformers reasonable attempts course correct them. require person huge amount office jobs. anything office nonsense distracts work often not. I’m scared I’ve never face prospect getting infected myself. Look, it’s “most people get flu-like symptoms”. It’s internet. COVID give heart problems haunt forever. Look up.

In America, whining. “I’ve done part.” “It’s over.” “I tired this.” cases rise.

What learned America baseball team 5-4 8 innings, we’d leave field claiming won.

Updated 3:41 a.m. ET

JERUSALEM — Friday morning, Old City Jerusalem, limestone alleys Christian quarter, pandemic never happened.

The winding passageways form Via Dolorosa, along Christians believe Jesus hauled cross toward crucifixion, packed 1,000 worshipers. covered market, air smelled incense echoed Christian hymns. Good Friday procession, faithful retrace route Jesus said taken, back.

“It like miracle,” said Rev. Amjad Sabbara, Roman Catholic priest helped lead procession. “We’re online. We’re seeing people front us.”

Pandemic restrictions forced cancellation last year’s ceremony required priests hold services without congregants present. Now, thanks Israel’s world-leading vaccine rollout, religious life Jerusalem edging back normal. Friday, brought crowds city’s streets, relief even one Christianity’s solemn commemorations: Good Friday procession.

The streets packed Friday’s procession. Last year’s Balilty New York Times

“We lucky here,” said May Bathish, 40-year-old chorister Father Sabbara’s church Old City. “When walk steps Jesus did, highest privilege.”

For much past year, pandemic kept Old City eerily empty. shops, synagogues churches often shuttered, alleys bereft tourists pilgrims. nearly 60 percent Israeli residents fully vaccinated, city’s streets thrumming, even foreign tourists still absent.

“When empty, like city ghosts,” said Ms. Bathish. Now, added, “it city life.”

At gathering point procession Friday, scarcely space stand. Police officers blocked latecomers entering nearby side streets. Members Catholic youth group formed ring around bearers large replica crucifix, centerpiece procession, spare carrying jostles sea worshipers.

Many procession Palestinians became Israeli residents Israel captured Old City 1967, along rest East Jerusalem. Around 6,000 Christians live Old City, alongside Muslims Jews.

“Walk behind cross!” shouted church official. “Behind cross, everyone!”

Above hubbub, Father Amjad called congregation walk pairs. “Two two,” shouted loudspeaker. “Not one one!”

Then crowd moved slowly off, singing mournful hymns proceeded along Christians consider re-enactment Jesus’ last steps.

They walked fits starts Via Dolorosa, past site tradition holds Jesus tried Pontius Pilate, past flogged mocked, past shops selling Christian icons crosses, ice cream T-shirts.

They turned left right, places Christians believe Jesus stumbled — once, twice, three times — weight crucifix.

In alley outside chapel St. Simon Cyrene, marchers trailed fingers ocher limestone chapel wall. According tradition, Jesus steadied stone stumble. many pilgrims, many centuries, since caressed stone surface smooth touch.

Finally, reached Church Holy Sepulcher, believers think site Christ’s crucifixion, burial and, ultimately, resurrection.

For some, Good Friday procession carried even resonance usual — themes suffering, redemption renewal seeming particularly symbolic end deadly pandemic appeared finally sight.

“We gained hope again,” said George Halis, 24, studying priest lives Old City. “Last year like darkness came earth.”

For others, theological importance, well emotional one, able gather together again.

“All Christians part body Christ,” said Msgr. Vincenzo Peroni, Catholic priest based Jerusalem regularly led pilgrimages within Holy Land. “Being able celebrate together makes visible.”

But now, togetherness still faces limits. still restrictions number worshipers Easter services. Masks still legal requirement. foreigners still need exemption enter Israel — keeping thousands pilgrims, cost local shopkeepers depend business.

“It still feels like it’s normal,” said Hagop Karakashian, owner famous ceramics shop Old City, whose family designed neighborhood’s street signs. “The locals celebrate, yes. something still missing.”

The mood among Christians miles away, Palestinian cities Bethlehem Ramallah, even less jubilant. Christians occupied territories visit Jerusalem special permit, become even harder procure pandemic. Israelis vaccinated, vast majority Palestinians haven’t received dose.

Israel supplied vaccines 100,000 Palestinians living occupied West Bank, almost work Israel West Bank settlements. Palestinian officials obtained around 150,000 doses.

But Israel says isn’t obliged vaccinate rest Palestinian population, citing clause Oslo peace accords 1990s, transferred health care duties Palestinian officials. Critics say still Israel’s responsibility help, citing international legislation requires occupying power oversee health care occupied populations, well separate clause Oslo accords says Israel must work Palestinians epidemics.

Either way, infection rates still high occupied territories vaccination rates low — limited number Palestinian Christians granted permission enter Jerusalem Easter year. spokesperson Israeli government declined reveal final number.

“Without permits, cannot come,” said Rev. Jamal Khader, Roman Catholic parish priest Ramallah. “It’s sign continuous presence occupation limitations movement.”

But Christ’s crucifixion resurrection still provide spiritual nourishment despondent population, said Father Khader, allowed enter Jerusalem work church.

“We identify sufferings Christ Good Friday,” said.

“Then,” added, “we find hope Easter Sunday.” know policy change come day, 100 days masks either ignored backtracked Unconstitutional. 

The Governor Texas constitutional authority tell private business owners property owners must business allow ontontheir property except cases protected classes (race, gender, age, national origin). Unfortunately while. We'll sail past 60% 60 70% take much longer getting 50-60%. Impact Easter aside, next 1-2 weeks likely vaccination rate peak. 

13 51 states (including DC) days supply: Alaska, Alabama, Mississippi, Wyoming, Georgia, South Carolina, Hawaii, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, West Virginia, Florida. states already demand constrained (possibly excepting Hawaii Florida slow loosen eligibility guidelines). 

Those states - best - keep level vaccination rate likely start fall (some already have). states ""pick burden"" keep vaccination rates up, become demand constrained near future well. North Carolina, Idaho, Missouri, Kansas, South Dakota likely demand constrained within next 1-2 weeks example. says this? I’ve spent plenty time anti-lockdown subreddits literally never heard anything remotely close this. course does. Anything makes sense against. can’t stay locked inside forever

Who advocates that? point expect keep simple things like masks trying keep much distance possible, even start returning activities / engagement. People need stop thinking shit binary. GOOD. time governor's common sense basic understanding liberty. Wish could find parties sightly nerdy/geeky, socially well adjusted folks get tanked sundown.

Gotta connect community people.

I got bit lucky found social group folks like around 15 years ago. couple years younger me, lot common like enjoying nerdy things sci-fi fantasy, video games, etc.

Now best friends, I'd even call family. partied HARD late 00s, anymore we're much likely crush 1-2 beers play board games talk much GoT sucked end ""party"". Working home limits forced social interaction work. Again, interested layman take guesses huge pinch salt, suspect demand could see mRNA versions conventional hormone therapies getting human trials within 5 years, treatments think next 5 years could see small scale proof concept tests similar timeframe (such using delivery mechanism tag cancer cells protein alert immune system, things like that) 3rd wave started pretty much day vaccinations started. ~8th December. Kent variant started work December, since spread US nations causing issues there. year point. Thinking 2 1/2 weeks break us. light end tunnel. get science-haters take vax well. Take that, Jolene! opposite. want us take actions put virus far behind us possible. little work.

What learned America baseball team 5-4 8 innings, we’d leave field claiming won. 3,000 new cases province Ontario. think means we're close winning! make Christmas New Years much easier me. normally get depressed around time much family spend holidays NYE feel pressure fun..and years don't. year, everyone nothing feel left out. best I've felt around holidays years. year people still believe tests conclusive. give folks satisfaction knowing unhappy. schadenfreude disgusting.  3rd wave started ~8th December. first vaccination 8th December. hit 40% coverage Feb. Yeah, like taking away person's sense self-righteousness. seem sad longer able virtue signal pics wearing three masks, wearing one outside walking alone, able shame others. bragging done anything fun 14 months bravely part fight virus. Lol, poor people. giant empty spot souls ends. thing saying now. selfish idiots can’t deal adversity. Damn. Well least deaths don’t seem jumping. Thanks expert medical opinion weeks ago, Governor Greg Abbott lifted statewide mask mandate, leaving choice wear one people businesses.
Since March 10, 2021, Texas seen decline average daily case rates, hospitalizations deaths COVID-19. 

James Henson, director Texas Politics Project University Texas Austin, says newest poll team working shows Texans mask usage dropped drastically since mandate ended.
""We still 80% Texans, recently month, reporting wearing masks go out,"" Henson said. reading article 2017 (ish) Moderna focusing genetic diseases b/c wasn’t much money interest mRNA vaccines. kept thinking “Well aged like milk.” ""I important"" reason washington post. news story. know many people ask fool get kicked places day? media bullying trying teach someone lesson. embarrassment journalism. basis journalism ""do dislike person, want readers dislike them."" ironic thing best mask anyone there. Now, tested positive later trying sneak in, would story. story. It’s major focus New Normal movement.

I'd like know movement. Care share website tollfree number call? That’s probably time zero fucks given.  clearly didn’t look introverted parents trapped home small, extroverted beings creation. feel you. watch MMA. care Football. would rather hear someone's garden, BBQ hang outdoors put music chill. 5 days week work 1 dedicated NFL makes boring lol. end spending free moments girlfriend. lucky enough friends care sports, harder get together without set time, like kick off. Relatively big sure, compared today. current 7 day average trends deaths still 'moderate'. would likely expecting ~35 today normal terms. you’re vaccinated care? could we're seeing cases appear younger (ish) populations UK started receiving AZ. go sleep memorizing yesterday's total count.

Good thing posted every single thread together detailed breakdown dose, age, rolling averages, etc. bunch LTCFs December January February months. Residents excited get yeah, staff always hesitant. hope people get people want it. JNJ perfect vaccine hesitant. can’t talk coming they’re good. Plus it’s old school tech they’re familiar with. #THIS RIGHT staying home definitely felt peace. I'm vaccinated alot friends well starting get together again, honest I'm enjoying much thought would. believe consensus belief 

So actual facts, like tooth fairy. Glad one 100 million people Misery loves company Im introvert felt good throughout pandemic honest. Introvert here. got work home way less stressful due lower socialization, comfortable environment, fear someone tandong behind making sure job, less traffic, commute(kids still daycare). Also longer back back back invites party's, holidays, get together etc could enjoy quiet weekends home get top tasks here. I'm alot relaxed top keeping home clean. What’s hilarious like getting 100 yards finish line deciding walk car drive home. We’re able see finish line effective vaccination we’re yet. Literally like month two tops. 

But anybody saying there’s actual lockdowns anywhere crazy. Maybe restaurants to-go outside dining only.   Luckily Kent variant vulnerable current vaccines, plan change US vaccination rate see similar case/hospitalization drop UK shortly. link showing rest spread came Yeah, definitely type insufferable misanthrope complaining about. clearly helping putting dishes away.  Household social gatherings accounted 74% infections sept-nov time period, 

healthcare delivery second place 8%, college students third 2%. 

Restaurants bars, inside outside, combined accounted 1.4%. 

Lower education (elementary-high) accounted 1.1%, elementary driving charge 0.5%. Teachers combined (K-college) made 1.5%, 

travel, sports, public services like EMS police, transit accounted ~1% cases each. thing... are, but..

At old hospital policy simple.

You get annual flu jab get shiny sticker ID badge, wear mask flu season.

Now since everyone wear mask shift anyway, staff saying getting covid vaccine **and** won’t get flu shot either. *facepalm* feel like “why I? I’m wearing mask anyway!”

Using masks basically socially coax people getting flu shot backfired. would normally consider introverted pandemic hard me. need alone time recharge family gathering day work, also still liked going house involved activities, going sports events, even sitting Starbucks shopping leisure. It’s really struggle gone felt trapped. also apartment live work in, it’s like tons space recharge in. 

I’m really looking forward continued loosening restrictions seeing people relaxed. find stressful really full normal life back. can’t relate introverts glorifying stay home life. write anything box. literally every single time want get roller coaster amusement park..... time ubiquitous upsets feelings. Look around literally see health safety warnings strenuous activity. Maybe paid attention gotten upset affect directly.

I'm sorry companies wanting liability property problem you, now.

Honestly, customer demanding exception health requirements visit massive red flag enforce them. wouldn’t call mental disorder, realistic. things getting better people vaccinated, there’s still decent amount risk unvaxxed especially, everyone extent. Also, lives changed drastically, makes sense people adapted better even enjoyed changes would grief prospect old normal. resigned fact go office times week, plan keep dine-in restaurants special occasion thing even pandemic. supposed surprising sort revelation? Damn, people greater need socialize like isolated prefer alone time might take badly. Color surprised. South Africa stopped cases least third adult population infected, going excess death count ~ 1% fatality rate. 

It plenty contagious then. want sit home ordering stuff Amazon Uber Eats browse Reddit day? that’s I’m getting here.

Seriously, guys acting like vaccine passports = new permanent normal. That’s far case, going happen couple months US fully vaccinated. lot depends upon business, desperate customers return, specific seating situation is. FL, local fast food franchise dining room closed 2020, began reopen towards end year. days ago, tried go inside get takeout, door locked, sign said ""DRIVE THRU ONLY"". may precautions inside workers might difficulty getting enough staff cover front counter clean dining room customer departs. Good move Kind makes wonder else media dishonest about, no? Well respond actually said. Brits emotionally attached AZ vaccine. objective. course problem, even one perception. Downplaying data worst possible solution. Seriously. Real world studies shown vaccine prevent infection, seems prevent spread. get people get vaccine, letting fully vaccinated congregate small settings would better message. point still stands. COVID extremely scary virus may effects way beyond flu like symptoms. least it’s scarier lot people give credit for. people think, “Oh, I’m young don’t think lot happen me” That’s wrong. Apples oranges viruses properties less year ago. 

This correct Ontario hit B117 incredibly hard. well 63% cases, [link B117 60% likely hospitalize, 100% likely send people ICU, 60% likely kill. [Link Friendly piece advice: proper word situation antisocial, rather *asocial*. problem damn contracts signed biontech like EARLY last summer.

Many EU countries wanted AstraZeneca last year cheaper. initial orders were:

- 400 AstraZeneca

- 300 Sanofi

- 400 Janssen

- 100 Biontech/Pfizer

It's Sanofi failure Germany decided buy Biontech EU agreed buy Biontech CureVac. Germany even criticized wanting Biontech. Ok. agree me? 

Young people risk covid! Less risk driving roads? (Let’s see “believe science”) per capita

You realize vitamen deficiency big factor covid deaths? Pretty sure many healthcare settings flu vaccines required. Well, good thing it’s tested strictly minorities time? isn’t initial trials conducted, isn’t initially rolled out, many states made available middle aged residents, even younger. don’t understand paranoia point, although maybe it’s sentiment decreased lately. still managed kill half million people year US Username nothing Disney. Haven’t since kid. 

Reality (for part - yes know outliers) outdoor transmission rare. established last year.

Especially attendance limits anyway. 

A blanket policy type silliness turns people otherwise valid messaging too. looks like nothing covid theater. COVID *might* give heart problems. FTFY Geez, antisocial asshole people skills lot internalised hate (who falsely labels themself introvert) comments stuff everywhere thread. Consider getting professional help.
Consider 7 people died result AZ vaccine UK. link number deaths age group.

Do genuinely think vaccine bigger threat covid stats? Unfortunately thats given. millions country refusing get vaccinated. Hasn’t failed me. KN95 protected direct hit dentist fillings patient didn’t know covid Yeah UK fucked good...it’s dictator ship 🤮 think don’t want vaccine pay enormous health care premiums choice since much greater risk hospitalized. think might trick.... anyone forcing anything? even know even associate voter suppression methods ensuring people entering private property infected pandemic unless someone focus test right word association upsets susceptible group Americans... legally can't, like legally can't ban instituting vaccine passport choose to.  Well, depends want social interaction.

At least kinda like job (actually bit worse, quite like actual job): one hand want enjoy it, hand also need want benefits (like friendship ""money"" equivalent social interaction) seek out. Easter crowds ski centers despite much lower vaccination rate. Let's see effect spread, probaby much. hear “young people”, 59 year old retirees pop head? 

It say young people. said younger. words all. Face grasping straws get outraged. get annoyed silly Reddit arguments. Reddit filled introverts get that. means Reddit population skewed view makes life worth living part population. lot people don’t find peace quiet solo hobbies. lot us don’t get recharged alone time. whole population need human interaction make day day. Introverts feel satisfied FaceTimes discord. can’t wrap brains around doesn’t lot people. No, that's scientific method works. Scientists observe something make educated guess it. devise way test hypothesis.

Here observations educated guess P.1, B.1.351 appeared fully formed 17+ mutations. cannot happen (p~2^(-17)) via gradual mutation among hosts infected short period time. 

The working possibility caused species crossover, cause similar effect hiding mutations they're fully developed. mutation spreads better mink, like Cluster 5 strain found Denmark died out, necessarily likely also spread better humans.  ones going take mask away make play outside others kid, relax.

Feel free ignore pesky good data regarding vaccines Change name dumbass_joe Riveting stuff. news, sky blue sometimes clouds it.

I get apply everyone, obviously. really need uni study tell us people like around people enjoy lockdown, people like around people many issues it? Money well spent. Whitmer gonna lock Michigan bet 🤦🏻‍♂️ I'm glad I'm scheduled Friday second shot. work weekends it'll give couple days recover. Update: ass isn’t getting KICKED per se certainly getting handed itself. Mostly brain fog body fatigue rn  Agreed.

I'm introvert. I'm working home year (probably rest year too). I've following social guidelines rare occasion venture out. I'm sleeping better, eating better, healthier, lost weight, poured real passion hobbies.

That said, I'm done whole thing really pissed assholes dragged out. second I've finished vaccinations I'm taking trip. He’s done it: full Jethro. Exactly, it’s weird people try touch without asking Texas would take 40 100 plus anyday. high 99 coming Wednesday Thursday. Wtf? barely April. Without sterilizing immunity, people still need take precautions herd immunity reached. 

To otherwise pure selfishness. ""I got mine, f' you"". public health crisis. live society together. 

If indeed confer sterilizing immunity, matter. case wearing masks distancing till reach said herd immunity STILL hurt anyone. UK US transparent prioritizing citizens first, 

Not true, UK health minister said last year UK citizens would get priority. Probably 30ish, take trendline last two months. I’m bit introvert doesn’t mean like stay home time. crawling walls mid April. started going grocery store almost every day leave. really going matter, actually power that. vaccine passports way go travel large indoor events federal level going leg stand on. Yes, see I’m introverted middle schooler hasn’t great me. much social interaction online “school” year taken toll. people literally can't tolerate company. Well thank keeping world running I’m sure didn’t feel like deserved time potentially health. Light end tunnel! using cdc's vsafe report side effects. also i'm happy report 95% back normal! seen huge improvements alst 12-18 hours sure. Even Ireland (who strict past months vaccinated much UK) allowing fully vaccinated meet indoors maskless. don’t give flying fuck. aren’t concerned children likely die car accidents Covid get it. risk low it’s time move on. Let kids live you’ve vaccinated. It’s like fight death get one SE Pennsylvania. group 1A since January able get appointment Title says N95 picture kn95 used to, nobody read second post, probably default sort new, anyone replies first post bumps second one down... sure best thing is. need better friends! ton guy friends none sports. Artists musicians creative types safe bet. back pain end luckily lots hip pain! usually hurt whenever get chills. Imagine getting Covid like.. NICE symptoms. know lot people deterred vaccine bc side effects they’ll nothing compared actual virus. Hopefully you’ve got heating pad back! not, heat rice sock min so, dog tore LCL two days ago she’s got little sock heating pad Introvert checking elevated mood video calls. Ugh excuses make get dreadful things. felt relieved rather forced. want socialize people, I'm getting groceries, walking dog. No. even say imply that. information data points toward immunity sterilizing, study make true yet. You’re unbelievably ignorant self serving. Getting vaccine you, it’s protecting ppl crazy variant atmosphere live right now. It’s irresponsible get science backs makes 100% immune death much less likely hospitalization. seeing deaths doesn’t make want change stance good population, something wrong you. proud carry vaccine passport show civic duty fellow people world. Thanks, post thread days. vaccine gave fortune cookie? That's great! mine gave nagging voice head upgrade Windows 10. nah, understood tangenting bit. 

the reason described ""tolerable,"" ""comfortable"" (which mean quite literally absence temperature related discomfort). possible even extroverted friends uncomfortable feel worth toughing out, necessary uncomfortable 40 degrees. 

the reason tangenting information family members seem understand, good lightweight winter coat think impossible comfortable outside less 50 degrees, seemed possible might people missing outdoor activities would enjoy. saw mood improvements pandemic lame hell probably insufferable no-life Cannot possibly true. I’m introverted hated home I've gained 15lbs hair literally falling out. Finally went doctor found severe vitamin deficiency, hopefully getting sorted help.

What really fucking need though trip Vegas friends 😪 is, want scaremonger That's true. infections late fall second wave.  RemindMe! 27 Days incredibly misleading headline COVID? Color shocked. know there's data countries right...? UK recently reported 30 clots whereas previously none. That’s load bollocks. 30 cases 7 deaths 20m+ vaccinated. Get facts right definitely true - saw myself, you.

Here's lest someone say fake single one doses leave European Union

The EU promote development production mRNA vaccines, etc., supply world life-saving vaccines drugs. bit delayed decision making Novovax UK? THought data submitted weeks ago? would manufacturers using Chill bruh, Moderna almost Ctrl C + Ctrl V Pfizer's vaccine extroverts like walking airhorns blasting constantly find info actual manufacturers avoid. introverted well, would also saybid suffered decline. 

Unused work office, actual office door. could really control noise level interruption interpersonal interaction given day.

Working home office door....I dedicated somewhat separate area work in, kids louder anyone office used have. 

I miss commute all, getting back school gotten better, I'm dreading summer vacation.  2020 sobering realization apocalypse (zombie movies etc), people die first days due actions. though. pledged distribute vaccines stockpile didn’t even exist. DeSantis removed lockdowns every idiot arms covid FL. Where's mass death rates killed FL? Oh wait never happened knows studies coming online definitively prove that, hell waiting study become officially published telling public already proven? could forget best part?! Introvert professor here.

Despite tired workload converting online teaching, mood greatly improved regarding job.

Less bullshit students (everything easily recorded online) also one shows door office hours because...well log grade record video. colleagues eating time tell ate day before.

Meeting still pain ass, least multitask case «  meeting email »

Admin fluff cut extra unpaid hours promoting college/program/dept gone.

So energy goes toward students, left me-time end day don’t need recharge much before. They'd likely dead instead inside Dunkin Donuts fully vaccinated. also problem wearing mask - wear one walk dog, etc. compliant long they’re mandated, cannot wait stop wearing them. skin point can’t handle anymore. Can’t imagine it’s like people wear hours end.  currently tearing BC inevitably rest country going make January numbers look tiny comparison, current vaccines struggle kills 20-50 year olds.

 look pandemic waves Spanish Flu exactly thing happened.

We learned nothing. hope too. also stuffy nose inflamed nasal passages. Didn’t think would happen super weird certain religion much choice getting vaccine, businesses cant bar certain religions cant bar unvaccinated people Ok. also got us vaccines, talking about. four weeks I'll full immunity able put incredibly mentally taxing lockdown portion life behind me! I've same. I've therapy PTSD since 2008. 2020 first year seen improvement literally leave home. I'm going hate going back old way may affect mental health. 

My wish future jobs give people option whether want go work work home. way extroverts gather introverts stay alone. news price shovel skyrockets Brazil people dig graves. agree. think we'll plateau that. many idiots. need island. Australia stopped massive outbreak Victoria last year spreading state simply closing state borders. Canada already closed land border year now. Nothing preventing except lack political will. people literally know now. good news though. still croaking heart disease cancer high levels! Sorry Trump admin mismanaged handling pandemic politicized mask use. Don’t forget downplaying virus, lack federal assistance delays. He’s responsible thousands upon thousands deaths. I'm introvert. anxiety, never really wanted work home would new I'd worried failing. quarantine happened and, guy, forced work home.

For introverted butt, blessing. gotten much time daughter, hearing ramble work, seeing take break invaluable. top that, lose hour+ time commute.

I'm currently looking new job thinking moving state team may moving back office soon. exclusively looking remote positions, anything says go back office later instant skip me. know feeling. Getting first dose vaccine one happiest days life! DC pho  EMA carefully worded statement. never said thrombosis events happening, benefit outweighed risk, especially countries uncontained COVID spread France, Germany, etc. PharmD. know fucking enough opinion. got first dose Moderna today. can’t describe relief felt Amen. There's also side ""he's liar, daddy fired him"". Certainly complaining ordering bulk vaccines  whole Canada essentially island. one border closed year. like huge numbers illegal US immigrants sneaking Canada. could followed strategy elimination countries. closed borders all. failure using mitigation failing quarantine new arrival Canadian citizens hotels 2 weeks way Australia NZ do. they're not. really opinion that, people chance get shot decline, I'm sick requiring crap someone made active choice knowing risks. go forth still well. Longer lockdowns way deaths??? employer asked mine first time pandemic moment driving home work remembered needed go store usual sinking feeling. started mentally prep trip wave realization go. enough food stocked, one coming over, fact world expected go. felt lighter air. Wow shit sherlock likely impact 0% antivaccers really isn't. Vietnam Taiwan high population densities succeeded elimination approach. Thailand South Korea found harder still vastly successful Europe Canada pursuing elimination even high population densities. 

NZ Australia technically low pop density vast amounts totally unpopulated land. people countries actually live nearly entirely cities high pop density US Canadian cities. Revenge 1776? Fine this, think wording vaccination order return “full person learning” year hard people.

Just day...someone drove play ground kids play blew head off. broad daylight. 

Cops told local parks like killing feild. 


The masks kids...do know giggle see classnates faces? Like seeing butt. 

The busineses loss. 

The destruction polis...the community. domestic violence. 

The lack cancer screenings throughout last year. Etc. 

No doubt...lock downs order first. 

But great cost. seems like steam inhalation making news part woods, citing couple references: problem is, former still process recruiting subjects whereas latter involved 10 subjects, hardly good sample size.

What I’m trying find is, high core temperature raised steam inhalation? Iirc need expose infected surfaces temperatures least 70C (158F) 2.5min 60min. it? 2.8 million people die per year, 23% would 600,000 excess deaths. Seems reasonable no? MI well. opinion don’t mean get political schools incentivized open back bringing students schooling home back buildings didn’t need be.  wife works elementary school classrooms packed back 30 kids. Cases local schools reported daily. major factor spread kids great asymptomatic carries bringing home. It’s downplayed deflected course Lansing factor. opted try bootstrap economy getting kids back school people get back work we’re paying worst infection rates country right now. Greed wins. Hawaii missing ;) makes sense Tokyo. I’m happy you! hope get within month so. Hopefully, news nearby ward, you’ll definitely able get summer’s olympics. ❤️ drove three different bars South Hills today. Every one’s parking lots completely full. 50 percent capacity ass. really learned lot determined extremely introverted professionally pretty extroverted personal life. company forcing us back office week I’m really struggling it. Considering looking new position work home full-time basis permanently. don’t enjoy social aspect work want job leave. would cheap schools part well.

Sadly, foresee bunch universities excuse keep cost saving measures guise ""covid"", even covid longer threat, still pretend since small percentage student body refuses get vaccinated, refuse mandate it. mind, I'll take guy runs site's word word rando. know city in, site use, eligibility rules are, plain lying. irony quite friends grandparents refusing AstraZeneca. bought Pfizer Novavax, majority locally produced Oxford/AZN Australian company CSL understand state mandated masks 9k cases per day they're getting rid there's 600k cases per day. Moratorium Cornell talk Maybe new vaccine India too? would make sense geographically There’s nothing easy coding(been sucking proffesionally 7 years now). worthwhile pursuit work appeals you, silver career bullet touted as. boot camp zero gaurentee job, you’ll still competing every bootcamp grad every traditional CS grad 4 year university. plausible path, worked wonderful engineers gone route. also know people completed program end back old roles extra 10k debt. kinda turned rant TLDR: coding pays well, you’re good it. Bootcamps expensive way maybe find like enough spend time getting good it. hurt stupid painless syndrome? anything suggests plexiglass actually useful? would issue virus aerosolized around room. walk back, guaranteed wanna get mine bad cried first shot. CVS felt kinda weird crying laxative aisle that’s past 12 months brought us 🤷‍♀️ Sent Great Value brands we're sipping Pfizer champagne glasses ghosting us since whole giving Meghan &amp; Harry refuge incident. What's point person classes? They're superior Zoom people, masks/spacing big deal. Trump ordered shit ton vaccines. guys shat sub saying padding pockets buddies. really, really are. confirm. Fr got first shot I’m gonna hit tiddy bar soon That's true. well regard. hard part vaccinations, especially looks like it'll mostly AstraZeneca based (unlike NZ getting Pfizer/BioNTech) Dolly never shown arms worn short sleeve tops public. say want draw attention tattoos, part mystique. I'm Wichita, KS. looks checking statewide pharmacies might Wichita thing. CVS example always appointments check Wichita none cities. county site appointments early Monday. reason say unvaccinated people already treating pandemic like it’s think ~30% vaccinated population good enough go “back normal.” Wait really 15 20 percent chance getting covid someone else house. thinking near 100 length close contact. Like someone lived diagnosed covid get ready sick too. part Australia still allow international travel covid too! Eek! Well I'm glad two side it, super happy got vaccinated! Take care! many days lockdown would balance extra cost vaccines lol. One? Two?

It's probably closer 1-4 hours. mean, US paid $40/person, $10 JnJ. Congrats vaccine! got mine longer going wearing unless required. Can’t believe people thread want world pause till end. may like things go back normal. Trust science trust vaccines. job P1 ok Brazil, BC next Good shit Yup. stuff approved FDA, worst public reputation.

It's point mom especially refuses vaccinated side family kind reinforces other's idea COVID sham vaccine Bill Gate's curse mind control device something along lines that.

Any clue convince her? Anyone go before? Large hospitals universities Pfizer since labs freezers store vaccines appropriate temperature. Yeah come it, retail pharmacy spend money deep freezers required get away JnJ Moderna. Capitalism cutting costs can. know fact chain doesn’t single one. people affording special freezers hospitals vaccine hub pharmacies (CVS) based metropolitan areas. It’s going limited problem, problem sure studies done. know dosages 30 micrograms? r/unexpectedoffice Cornell’s testing routine also outstanding.   niece someone gets care VA, close uncle VA volunteer years- know get screwed up. I’m glad they’re planning though. Pfizer fell 4 whole percentage points efficacy December analysis one came yesterday- 91.3% damn good... it’s 95.3%.... vaccine rollout finished fall Cornell provide vaccines, could grounds discriminatory behaviour?

Confusing yeah Cornell private institution, require whatever damn well please. Nobody _forced_ take it. Attending Cornell right. People lying Israel internet? I'm shocked. argument passport stuff going inside country (festivals, events, etc). essentially means people able things others can't, purely based fact they've chosen vaccine not. Meaning people lower list (teens/young adults medical issues) may able participate activities fault own. creates divide need happen cases low route lockdown going well. 

We may still require international arrivals vaccine check, would different getting jabs travelling abroad.

And speak CEV who's happy jab would encourage people get theirs, think internal vaccine passports probably unnecessary key difference Covid vaccines experimental, mmr tetanus not. government didn’t develop vaccines run trials. realm possibilities someone severe reaction anaphylaxis. think anyone require FDA approves it. make medical exemptions though, realistically mandate can't really go digging medical records. US developed country good roads. Even places far remote upstate New York freezers roads freezer trucks. sounds right. UK also varies years +/- 2% year before.

We excess deaths nowhere near 23%. UK lockdown eventually may kept excess deaths comparison US. Cornell said vaccinate anyone arrive yet. Obviously voluntary, presumably told leave refuse. Nope. Wear mask protect others. virtually argument contrary selfish zero interest. say I've useful third arm since high school... people vaccinated sept. 2021 fail see would safer sept. 2022. see saying. first part notes loosening restrictions fully vaccinated people amongst themselves. However, public around others may fully vaccinated, masks worn SD adhered to. right, could worded better. No. deatined extroverts means less late night parties sleep better. No. That's they're mandating vaccine. Missouri governor: require vaccine passports 

Missouri AG: care buy fake vaccine card mean... also require swimming test. don’t get Thursday announced lockdown didn’t take effect midnight Saturday whatever. BC, “effective tonight”. Basically “if you’re scheduled work tomorrow, nope, you’re not” one impacted (wait staff, gym class instructors, work snack-only food establishment, etc). 

I’m actually wondering impacts lawyer meeting Tuesday...? Exactly. They'll say religion they're allergic it. extroverted doesn’t mean loud/outgoing/lots friends, either I'm saying he's right, fact you, one person, successfully got appointment mean he's wrong. Shaming people coming events. Shaming people consuming drugs (alcohol notably).

Newspeaking language (""social"" distancing designate fact ""physical"" distancing, physically absent people social life).  proof that? Sure, mean whatever want meantime. far Vietnam several cases chinese Vietnamese sneaking country test positive covid. Vietnam stopped thousands people entering illegally.  actually true definitely extroverted recharged socialization, whereas introverts recharged alone time. People seem think means “outgoing” vs “antisocial” factors little introverted extroverted. 100% agree post, excellent point.

All said, legislature party governor even order struck, they'll 100% pass law. think argument I've heard vaccine currently approved emergency use. think can't forced take fully approved.   It’s pronounced Colonel it’s highest rank army Looks like I'm one Basically known co morbidities. New York State whole requires MMR. Lemme tell ya something. worn mask unless im asked to. dont care theres paper front door anything, care enough youll ask face. dont wear one simply EVIDENCE DATA. yall know everyone wearing masks still surges ? matter what. Things FINALLY slowing thats cause vaccines, masks. able work bar mask still get covid ? Doesent make sense me, also how, since ive gotten covid( months ago ) gotten barely ever wearing mask getting vaccine go restaurants, grocery stores, malls, even went disneyland. one positive result. really wuite amazing. wouldnt call antimasker cause wear one want ill respect whoever asks me, tell whats saving us. You’re completely fooled time masks come off. Prove wrong. want people continue dying care anymore? Pfizer lasts 6 months btw. Must renewed states restrictions still place consistently better job distributing doses states open anyone. explain vietnam's success? argument falls purveyance emergency management power based state statute. don’t necessarily buy this, politicized, could see state Supreme Court ruling Desantis’ favor. rules overstep executive powers, legislature would almost certainly pass similar bill Idk comments explained poorly: average amount people infected single currently infected person. less 1 means virus decreasing prevalence 1 means becoming increasingly prevalent community wonder deaths due taking Pfizer Moderna vaccines hidden press, seriously report 6th march year 25% elderly patients home elderly died getting Pfizer vaccine, hear AZ small insignificant amount deaths hear rate 25% dying getting Pfizer vaccine, one word press, data hidden eu attacks AZ every day multiple cases lies told Germany France Italy.... Funny certain individual said would last Easter. laughed! really dont get people problem unvaccinated people, vaccinated? could literally spit face would get sick. 

I get brief period time next 1-2months people us still arent able get vaccinated. time? store owner employee cant get vaccinated, need passport? 

Let people decide Outgoing + extrovert + wfh + hubby mostly wfh + pandemic = watching TV movies day work hear people talking taking cats way much. Plus health decline. Agree - found 3 different places brief search husband - towards suburbs (vs within Dallas). Texas open ages too. Interestingly, kid college can't find openings within 50 miles Austin - blue vs red areas seem different levels hesitancy. used much bigger deal me, knowing effective 1 shot Pfizer/Moderna means every first dose 2 weeks 70%+ protected. Good thing vaccines work variants. Humidity going play big part comfortable well. exactly association voter suppression ID laws vaccination records?

Other 20 years late worrying smartphone might used track location see point. Without mask? try put relative terms. Vaccinated people roughly similar even less risk unvaccinated people flu. 

Considering covid average IFR 0.5ish% flu IFR 0.02-0.10% . Assuming vaccine prevents 95% deaths (even may conservative), would put adjusted IFR 0.025 Covid%.

Most people would stop hardly anything flu season even vaccinated flu. 

This little complicated fact also risk spreading covid many people still able get vaccinated changing fast US. 6-8 weeks adult wants vaccine chance get one. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Israel started see major downturn 2 weeks hit 40% coverage. likely 30% w/both doses 50% w/ least one. 

USA 25% coverage, Israel likely midst spike averted due vaccine. USA infection based immunity spring way. guess 3 weeks cases begin final decline, 4 weeks becomes obvious happening. Assuming people keep getting shots is. Disney Parks playing **super** safe, last thing want repeat shingles headlines years back, time COVID.

I’d totally requiring unless indoors, making sure people put get lines enter restaurant another hurdle may easier require time being.

I fully expect WDW Florida stop requiring masks end year. Yes, anecdotally parent 6y/o, she’s third cold school year. seems NPI’s extremely effective stopping flu, moderately effective stopping covid, almost ineffective stopping common cold. talking last weeks. slightly different point. Especially Mississippi opened everyone many states higher % administered/allocated still 65+. 

Imo needs threshold states allocated vaccines. state can't stay 60% administered/allocated, keep allocation. states still high demand places getting hit hardest (Michigan) getting doses. state gets 60%, given more. insane places like Wisconsin giving fast Georgia sitting 2 million doses giving 4 million entire time. CDC says OK around others long 10 days since first symptoms, symptoms improving, gone 24 hours without fever (without fever-reducing medication). read somewhere Covid, first shot tends worse. not, second shot worse. can't remember (or if) science behind it, held true friend group least. Covid? Maybe second bad! Doom opinions aren’t popular anymore. trusting science. Vaccines work + pandemic soon. :-) nice day. Yeah baseball outdoors Good move. hope governors follow suit. Curious part country you’re in? I’m Seattle still difficult get appointment, impossible, definitely need persistent pursue opportunities.

Even east side WA far conservative anecdotal evidence anyone walk mass vaxx site get it, blows mind. Exactly like that. thinking reading this. That’s it. finally felt free. much time wasted work expectations social obligations. work peace without constant interruptions dream. pointless in-person meetings every week made life better. lot modern job expectations irrelevant. Oh yeah cool, getting tested everyday, waiting line half hour getting something stabbed nose waiting half hour. practical thing every time want go walmart.

Why care vacinated ans someone plane not? safe whether vaccinated not. dont get it

Im vaccination get vacced self, discrimination ahainst people decide to. Anti science neanderthals. running live action darwinism lab 'Murca. “Voter suppression” mean people can’t cheat elections again. sports outdoors? would even less ""risky"" something played inside. think sub getting flooded people panicking returning normal life want people either a) justify paranoia b) everything 100% ok vaccinated (not saying fall lot do) frustrating say thing ""if vaccinated probably fine yes vaccinated people catch COVID""

if pfizer/moderna would look reports coming Israel - lot data pfizer effective real world.

really sorry hear know people personally passed away. UK half world's genomic testing discovered? 

Might proven originated outside UK. really compelling evidence originated within either. 

Can't really say either way right now, originating part country lower density highest travel links seems even coincidence discovered. success seen case numbers. Look US UK vs European countries. plateaued bit fight variants, quick vaccinations preventing another massive wave.   must business. government LOT say cannot business. strain ravaging Brazil likely next. sure reported dozen states. It’s asinine, clearly understanding estimate risk. 

In Canada, 5 every 100,000 people die roads every year.

With new “more fatal” variant, 4.9 every 100,000 confirmed infections 34 fatal.

That means : even every single Canadian 35 become infected - **it would less fatal driving Canadian roads**. Yeah, that's true. lot trolls, usual, really point make. want trolls do. :) crowded yeah, like outdoor markets, nothing ever crowded.


we currently mandate though, mask wearing either 100% 1% depending mandate not. I’m immunocompromised qualified early vaccine. Yes, even Israel mandatory mask-wearing outside, although government debating scrapping mandate. I've read compliance generally pretty low. reach 100 million fully vaccinated people May 17? eyes business always right serve someone example oqner doesnt like blacks jews? ok ask people jewss entering blocking them?

Im opposed vaccination, opposed discrimination.

Everybody problem unvaccinated people, let get vaccinated problem disease, care? Sounds like excuse shit liberties rights individuals. Try see holds court. failed Belgium, cows. Fear mongers you. Factually wrong dangerous propaganda. Stop undermining vaccine effort. Michigan 42nd case per capita. believe Michigan saw January spike like states well. Introvert here. Obviously covid horrible many people lost lives loved ones. damn miss lockdown sometimes. live LA traffic always awful, early lockdown streets buses empty wonderful. store work that's usually packed people finally since everyone ordering delivery. hours got cut, instead working 6-3 got easy 8-12 shift extra $5 hour unemployment make difference. really, really miss working 4 hours, going home immediately changing pajamas. 

The 'extroverted' thing missed, besides visiting family, going concerts. Live music can't come back soon enough. never remove risk need move lives. Vaccines amazing ther ending pandemic. I’m getting little exasperated idea clinging masks unless perfection. Perfection doesn’t exist. Yeah seeing others thought, understand perception risk wide range among everyone. two family members unexpectedly pass away virus last April shook. planning sitting first game two see judge that. 2 friends/ teammates vaccinated least. Thanks thoughts tho appreciate it. don’t think thought side coin. starts saying “vaccinated people go inside, go pubs, basically anything!” create huge divide you’ll also get people lie saying they’ve vaccinated not. think people know vaccine success far, eventually lead normality, can’t say vaccine rollout still ongoing, haven’t even done 50s yet. Let's ignore fact definition effectiveness different two trials... crowded outdoor locations too? seems vary tremendously location; somehow assumed Israel would patchwork Europe seems be. I’m assuming measures different Vermont. nothing linear mood. Every time step restrictions meltdown, gradually get back baseline. started new shutdown today, I’m sure number to. So, like... million deaths took precautions let virus run rampant prior developing vaccines? Nothing say people repsonding comment batshit insane useless arguments. really. saw 10 people store today wearing masks, kept wearing mine. respect rules private business. rule didn’t exist business probably wouldn’t wear one.

I don’t judge behavior based people doing. Ethics isn’t concerned groupthink, concerned set objective rules absent people’s subjective behaviors. I’m trying say without breaking “no politics” rule, go easy me.

Oh worries, know hard line toe. Thanks. looks like 10 percent cases fall unknown category. 

Still, indoor dining doesn’t seem like something need add risk budget time soon. Well we've sacrificed shitty weather winter early spring great mid spring onwards.

 We're probably gonna able watch Euros packed pubs weather's great entire summer gonna giant fuck sesh. aye going pretty good. feel countries Europe going position.  thing need? Take picture it.

Mine passport right (which lives document safe) times conceive needing I'm traveling need passport. Wait, mean like nerdy hobbies going every single day label introvert? Madness! Let’s go! large portion UK's death rate attributed us getting blindsided B.1.1.7 variant. see coming.

You watched surge infections death rates happen us we're watching happen you. Difference known dangers B.1.1.7 months. Anybody get thenvaccije soon, anybody problem infected people get vaccine everybody doesnt take risk. need vaccine passport, except creating 2-class system?

Im vaccination get vaccinated, vaccine passports, grants one group people mire rights unethical. Also dont want fucking scan smartphone everytime enter store. dont wmat data system know time... need sticky ""risk"" is.

yes risk. low? medium? high? can't answer you. want participate feel comfortable (and accept risk) sit household see feel.

risk relative. deem low risk, others might deem medium high risk. again, can't answer you.

FWIW low risk IMO. people masked, even lower. get vaccination, even lower. Full extrovert hard time, also leaned benefits forced introvert lifestyle (no kids partner harsh mellow). I’m definitely going take lessons learned future hybrid life. Hopefully introverts find common ground us extroverts future reminding us benefits COVID lifestyle conveniently forget come holiday season. States pass laws add protected classes beyond federal law could include health information vaccine status. happens, business would authority refuse service. constitutional issue going whether Desantis issue executive order whether would take legislative act so. bad Fauci. People hate introverts much Hopefully supply pharmacies open up, numbers going up. No, they’re actually 46th 49th comes per capita testing. data included source. Amongst lowest rates testing entire country. introvert definitely surprised. Aside tragedies accompanied pandemic, measures implemented felt like finally world suits me. Hardly. Businesses right protect customers. don’t want get vaccine, don’t expect every business humor you.  TiL I'm extroverted Good plan!

Wife got 2nd shot: fever &amp; vomiting! 😬
So there's range. aches, little queasey.

Mr. DeSantis simply adds them. Seriously. understand hard people work environment that's hard escape without finding another job. want go pub work coworkers, go party social outing? say no. really simple. I'm massive introvert want go will, energy I'll simply say no, there's guilt involved. someone tries guilt go tell them, politely, fuck off. common arm soreness vaccine (my first sore, 2nd not)....and light bleeding around injection site.

kinda nervous vaccine person correctly one assholes potentially spread virus killed people, huh? No. I've least personally never met extrovert understood people different them. introverts commiserate much online. Vaccine shield force field. 

You encounter virus, takes root respiratory system, begins replicate itself, sending copies back world infect others. 
    immune system gets notice virus arrived, starts creating specialized antibodies attack it. attacks virus, eventually destroying it. 

We don’t know long “eventually“ is. It’s going vary, even range still determined. affected course much virus encountered, good immune system is. 

It true may turn short window. get point know that, point people likely breathe also vaccinated, wearing mask simple thing make sure even us vaccinated breathing particular germ. I’m you! one shot today! It’s feels goooddddddd got bad news ya: govt used driver's licenses *de facto* internal passports decades. Wired wrote [27 years sure, mask inspector take care give in? right anti-lockdown forums good madam. accused crimes humanity suggesting vaccine safer virus, talked true anti-vaxer. Bill gates pedophile common one, connection coronavirus topic required. Watched now. Loved it. Tnx. people asking troll. told scared. told coronavirus MIGHT result health symptoms. responded saying “might give” scary enough. talking point made comment said scared. one going suddenly decide wear mask are. important neither I. lead ? You’re already letting everyone know could give shit. idea Tuskegee experiment clearly, you’re insufferable redditor remind 2 months NO. WOULD I'M GETTING ANGRY I'm jealous. US still higher per capita rolling case death counts. mean time, mean right now. need us. 

We're also vaccinating 200k per day lately population level equivalent almost 2M per day States. started slow ramp impressive. 

We're together there's use jealous feelings superiority inferiority. Seems like you’re scared COVID mutations Easy solution: make condition employment. shame several states (Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho, New Jersey, Virginia, Indiana) near top vaccinations used, near bottom doses distributed state per capita.

Meanwhile, keep distributing straight population curve.

If sent vaccines states using 85% supply, could pause slow states using 60% supply balance things out. Would probably 7-day average closer 3.5M instead 3M. news vaccines 80% effective first dose week.

I see info coming pretty quickly case last month two. Wouldn’t surprise see “definitive” proof spreading virus within next 60 days. time, way scientists’ minds work, also wouldn’t surprise see goalposts somehow moved haven’t vaccines year now. didn’t want wear mask free stay home, don’t want get vaccine you’re free stay home. I’ve heard many mixed things what’s going happen. advice I’ve gotten everybody stay hydrated. sure drink lot water congratulations! aren’t asking perfection aren’t “clinging” masks forever. life, 20% people vaccinated. percentage higher, we’ll stop masks. 

Some us. feel this. I've working whole time I'm single live alone. Anything need either stop store work get delivery. made vaccine appointment day realized, staring closet, literally months since put clothes uniform PJs.   got making dent point...in death rate nothing else since large chunk vulnerable protected. I'm afraid anything (at least regard). asked question irrelevant, I'm curious think I'm scared of. do, though? domestic manufacturing Canada whereas US does. 

We definitely sluggish start Canada third G20 countries vaccine administration (behind US UK). also less people state California comparatively shorter mountain climb. Call crazy I'm feeling optimistic nowadays. loaned Canada. article.  tell me, afraid of? depends are. example NY locations typically hold one vaccine type. theory find location vaccine you’d like book location. Can’t speak states, I’d assume also brought whole world closer alignment introverted behaviors. Suddenly fine go events would hundreds people. normal cancel plans around people could result feeling bad afterwards. Everyone talking isolated felt, desire alone, used stigmatizing feeling suddenly asset coveted. many stresses *other people* mercifully wiped away. try going board game meetups. tends draw nerdier folk open meeting new people. Performance problems uncommon. 1 5... fret *too* much. What's going happen USA starts realizing way many vaccines?

... they'll shipped Canada. think I'm scared of? seen locations using specific one pick sense looking location uses one want like show pick site. mean stay home three months need go see people? course fucking ecstatic, let's often. scared? There's thing 100%. 100% trials 30k so, however deaths vaccine rolled many millions. 

So answer question. least two weeks entered circumstance would normally infected COVID, 80% protected (and probably get even antibodies result encounter.) 80% protected serious infection death. much? knows. 

The protection provided 2 weeks vax puts risk line typical Flu would say. What???

This isn’t getting vaccine. whether appropriate government demand share personal health data anyone everyone order something routine going grocery store. Maybe make people wear sort identifying badge. way people easily discriminated against, belittled, shunned. Eventually, authorize special enforcement group stop streets demand papers. Yes, sounds like great plan. Nothing could possibly go horribly wrong. Lol. math approx. 600k. Yeah control allowed kids would go really well I’m sure mention amount people died Russia Sputnik trials  They've serving unvaccinated people year now, ask wear masks cases low justifiable you’re outside wearing mask would worry much. serious infringement every citizen’s constitutional rights. 

No not. Private businesses always right right continue. actually understand constitution think is. let guess, think what's happening Georgia fair play lmao.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Lotta people still need 2nd shot, think may we'll seeing lot age groups leveling anyone know pick vaccine get (J&amp;J, Pfizer Moderna) randomly selected you? you’re answer bashing AZ bash vaccines insignificant deaths?  mean true jealous US rollout, mostly federal government completely fumble vacone procurement....

But saying Canada distributed less 70K doses ""last Friday"" Ontario alone 80k+ two fridays weird assertion. 

Then again. star AWFUL math.

They accused Ontario vaccine backlog despite averaging 70K day, capacity double that, GETTING 450k doses highest weekly shipment feds yet last week. extroverts blog vlog problems? [Pfizer's also working variant say current model works well, they're testing another booster case since expect it'll work even better - current variants possible future variants. 

[Moderna thinking Yep...I can't help think that, rate vaccines rolled out, time useful ""passport"" system broadly implemented, significant portion country would vaccinated immunity disease. keep looking county's vaccine numbers. 18.7% March 31 80,562 - 16 years older. know thats good not. Seems pretty low me.

This red voting area effect I'm sure. Cases rising. Covid cases, deaths, hospitalizations *plummeted* past month. Quit bullshit also another one read, can't find moment. Ok, change opinion way convey make come conclusion. said “what going say people give zero fucks mid-may” responded saying selfish idiots can’t handle adversity. it’s basically certain time people still going along everything dwindling rapid pace. bad extroverted people probably fill upper management executive roles already forcing conversation returning offices

The worst one I’ve heard people
love commuting sitting traffic, it’s time ‘meditate’ Oh nice, yeh OK, rising cases good sign. heard all. 

Give time saying. Kee damn masks social distance months.

Peace out. There’s sign life here. think frequency able go social events, least people far extrovert scale. extroverted friends who'd go pub days work Fridays/weekends go clubbing after, could keep week week. destressed work.

While could manage clubbing month pub twice week left feeling mentally drained several days afterwards. aren’t. article literally says reduces infection 90%. Less viral load means it’s harder spread. 

The exact study you’re using shoes passing virus someone else. 

And think even second persuade people wearing masks they’ve vaccinated delusional. Lmao. view probably similar hard-hit countries. US way collect information, without national health service. Hey that’s I’m getting it! Stop selfish!! course, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Idaho, Arizona missing. working booster precaution. started either Pfizer Moderna knew vaccines would work. 

There good chance needed. mean already see Michigan cases rising nationwide even though vaccinated lot people already. Like get wanting everything normal, half measures perceived wrong way. Like would great could say, ""Ok, masks work well outdoors thought, still stay masked everyone chance get shot."" masses hear ""Masks work"" throw away masks. Context 

&amp;#x200B;

\- PiS PM've said virus retreat - **everythings safe - specially seniors - everything safe**

\- PiS aint gave fk epidemic... instead working throwing dramas / sowing tension / abortion ban / failing pass fur ban / infighting 

\- close country panic Eventually manageable concern. Agreed. see ""popular"" think businesses try time. Eventually they'll stop caring themselves. yeah. it’s great me. i’m want Yes common, neither parents got sick all. seems younger people get symptoms that’s anecdotal think. you’re looking internet Reddit people likely share experiences feeling like shit you’ll get larger share people feel fine both. would happy got symptoms either! Trump told take got CPAC, still many hesitate. found one coworkers thought finally convinced get going to. opportunity get shot, literally stumbled Rite Aid buy something offered shot turned down. infuriating. ask search Pfizer Modena vaccine deaths explain third page report Pfizer vaccine killing 25% elderly received it.....seriously amazing cleaned google search remove anything negative Pfizer vaccine Moderna deaths AZ seems. Yeah I’ve got maybe 3 friends hang every week. Losing social interaction drove mad lmao. humidity AKA humility Nothing wrote true. Didn’t seem unconstitutional every single governor every single state told private business owners must business allow property (only people masks).

Not saying it’s right, I’m noting interesting observation. really true. live alone work grocery store kitchen we've open whole time. got covid back December stay home close month god damn. thought people dramatic, like 'I'd love get dressed go work, they're lucky!' idea actually like stuck inside long. Unfortunately, do.

Cases rising. People like ready f’ up.  governments restricting exports one way another so... sovereign/national issue. coat man Nothing wrong that, least save money too!  Vaccine passports racist. back up. eagerly await SCOTUS case governors follow. 

This serious infringement every citizen’s constitutional rights. Honestly, come surprise anyone?

It’s bad enough first doses several months behind US/UK - think take another 4 months delayed second doses get freedom travel back - ugh. It’s really going hard watch life get back normal much faster places. Ugh week since first shot? Time going slow. stay home eat pizza watch YouTube. close yet far :’) Read article. realists sea people value wishes reality.  Nobody asking vaccine cards.

My employer asking vaccine cards, want come back work office. assume others are, too. funny, even though Republicans evolved party big government broad presidential powers, souls, still natural distrust anything bigger abstract understand - government, ""big data"", etc.  overheard co-worker office door saying going ""put garbage body"" travel something.  He's good job, he's smart guy things he's smart about. understand science vaccines, natural inclination distrust them. Actually, situation US right quite good. people whining covid media outlets. seen 4th wave yet. cases rising states opened vaccinations everyone yet. nyc, going start april 6th. give time.

And people honestly tired shit. year. Covid equivalent flu. least US developed habit talking alone without job 7 months. Super weird. Guess I'm introverted thought. Actually shouldn’t prove shit walk store restaurant (this hypothetical) Go read actual science good day. me, me, mentality. Likely know anyone impacted Covid. friend's parents died kind gives perspective. I'm glad live country sacrifice seniors economy muh freedoms. Great. getting soon :)

We, TX, open 2 weeks ago .. also lift mask mandate (which agree with), thankfully, numbers far going down. 

Probably partly vaccination. 15% TX population fully vaccinated (i.e. two doses) 7.9M least one dose (i one them). almost 30% population. 

I bet vaccination starting work, reducing overall infection rate now, though still way go. apocalypse like national news seems saying us, we're starting ease restrictions younger people gotten vaccinated yet going infecting other. long vaccinations continue current rate, bad, vaccinated yet might wise careful are. wonder they'll still require masks distancing like Rutgers doing. Canada jealous US's response public health? reached ratio yet though Peer review take couple months, maybe authors keep trying luck higher impact journals paper really “worth”. medrxiv (and biorxiv), see affiliations authors. decide qualified not. idiots. forget idiots. right rub faces saying governments failed whatever? mean douchie would feel good turn tables lol. Right? could’ve told busy reading, playing computer chess, baking cookies totally enjoying company. saying I'm part ground 40. Got Pfizer today! “dwindling pace” what’s causing current rise. saying is, reopening months soon. get ain’t yet.

And that’s opinion, that’s data: look infection rates Europe clear sudden increases cases started rise UK. Spain 6 weeks ahead terms infections. 

Considering France year UK week sequencing wise, going found there. much Sequencing Spain back then, even countries. worry measle moms either. I've vaccinated measles.  Biden succeeded approaching like war relented love Nice. looks like Pfizer/Moderna meet targets. Moderna look closer 2. Next week allocations Pfizer also down. Moderna slightly. course J&amp;J back big time. 

Anyway looks like supply outstrip demand everywhere May 1st. huge win. Hopefully complete vaccination 16+ end June least anyone want take one. Hopefully bend curve time R 1 goes near zero soon. That's comes every search I've tried, vasovagal syncope, mental thing simply understanding correctly?

He totally calm getting shot immediately think fear needles, exactly would ""triggering"" experience? Please stop babbling untruths: Introvert here, severe mood decline me. feel trapped. Dont count it, share hope! Thanks! that's reassuring I'm vaccinated care less vaccine status anyone else plane. thanks! dripping many partisan talking points I'm embarrassed also bring Ontario.

Canada best procurement world, diverse portfolio vaccines, nearly first line them. Short parotting nonsense Sino vaccine, think could that. 

Second, Ontario weird situation right now, necessarily anyone's fault. probably sitting 1 million unused doses, variety reasons sort of... Backed recently. We'll need hit 150k doses day get them, can't fault provincial government aiming high 100k target last week (which never hit) - blame incessantly whining like little partisan bitches federal government, hopefully put shut week comes nonsense.  roll20 win Thanks! contacts suggested apply love there. I'm hoping Yup. loved get Heb B shot order study computer science. Maybe put infected needles computers? (Heb B spread via blood) yeah feel guys hope get vaxxed soon Vaccines aren’t 100% effective illness. hope learn address climate change next. life dictators worry real election. 7th Maine opening anyone 16 older. Pretty much pre registration appointments booked. OK, put bias aside. vaccinated liberal. 

The vaccines modern miracle, haven’t given enough time get populace. get there, reopening crap coming soon.

The US case death rates plummeting early March. Reopenings started. drop ended numbers flatlined. cases going back up.

It’s early stop restrictions like masks distancing.

The vaccines aren’t perfect, know that. None 100% effective, always risk. that’s risk live with. idea became anti vaxxer? reminder phone lick doorknob Monday.  end lack leadership allowed ‘what do, anyway’ feeling dominate. 

Sucked watch. isn’t like scientists hadn’t warned this. age group comes close 20s. stats provided, it’s still likely die covid age group Free market reigns supreme post pic vax card phone camera work dollar order AZ likely amount nothing. 

At least AZ vaccines work, even approved US, sold on. total loss. Introvert here. leave house school days, really. I've graduated college got job inside house never hated it. I've really left house since March last year job requirements needed pass hiring. I'm missing outside one bit Thanks response potential time-line Science classes. took career next level.

Like mind asking There's condition called vasovagal syncope causes people faint experiencing certain triggers, like injections. generally harmless, let pharmacist know future shots take precautions.  introverts thread? yes also forgery bad worst kind since Human Lives stake good crackdown people Took 15hrs 2nd shot Moderna started kick ass. complete ass. Same! arm hurt way worse first time far side effects... Yet. sister got second last weekend put ass day. Fingers crossed avoid that. Soon, stay strong act responsibly. yet. case death numbers near need order give fight. Honestly lean introvert, fairly gregarious. feel like isolation covid suck, kind nice. Last year time since cut ubering driving country listening podcasts decompress great. told wife helped
Her cope too. Nice try extrovert. said TN guy one leaders. Rising cases = growth

And ignoring steep decline cases early March reopening soon crap started.

The result? decline halted. rise started.

That’s hand. stupidity.

It subside help happen getting smarter. whole f’ing thread nonsense spewed people stuck heads see reality even full light day.

We get need be, aren’t yet. question many fellow citizens kill next months would fine kept distancing masking? locking down. sheltering place, basic things hump. Take walk. here! know joke introverts prepared day time shine, lack touch person social contact made mental health take huge dive. husband would BFFs. He's also sports all. partier drinker (though like occasional beer). Loves music. bit nerdy (in best way). socially awkward. Etc.

He talk job lot, that's really interesting people wind wanting talk about. 

But making new couple friends challenge. always gel women (at least ""basic mom"" type). husband click husband. sort move on. met though years either like us, least enough depth find stuff common. took roommate get first vaccine shot today (Moderna). getting it, told stick around fifteen minutes case side effects. said feel shot. 

After maybe two three minutes, suddenly said feel good, turned took steps toward staff, fell straight floor, busting nose, lip, knee, causing bleed place.

I pretty shocked something like could happen. course, alerted staff he's mostly fine, explanation vaccine could cause someone faint?

All resources see talk fear nervousness getting shot could cause it, entirely calm fainted. know badly US messed early on. screaming contact tracing Nice see University Dr.Fauci got degree Duh? really worth studying? Right they’re acting like you’re gonna need vaccination card everything

Cool, anyways, New York one done private corporations demanding stadiums, that's proof *no* international travel dude. revelling - definitely gonna let ‘we best could’ brigade hook hubris. elite schools reason Many people soreness all! cells still thing. really polite it! Yeah, mainly it’s export stop.  got one, aggregator, Friday... I'm glad I'm person that's noticed this. I've casually lurked entire year, lately I've noticing lot ""the shut-ins want stay inside forever lol!"" kind posts. Borderline anti-masker, ""the pandemic hoax"" kind shit. keep seeing ""young people die lower percentages"" phrase getting parroted around excuse everyone run around pretend nothing ever happened I'm wondering forgot long-term symptoms/damage? realize particular age group highest risk want risk health even fraction chance. 

Once I'm vaccinated (and hopefully soon state) plan continue wearing mask staying away crowds high-risk situations while. made feel ashamed like I'm laughing stock hermit want protect health. really hard wear mask? 

This entire year made really start mistrust fellow humans. realize many, many people done right thing, said done one talking anymore know one people refused wear mask abused essential workers asked considerate others. staying inside rest life means deal people like lock in. ""until science says otherwise"" nonsensical. ""Science"" say lift mask mandates. That's political question. people gained weight likely tip scales towards earlier cardiac deaths. 91% chance spread it. Awesome doesn’t mean it’s 100% effective 95% people, 95% less likely contract virus. 50/50 vaccinated vs vaccinated group would expect see 1 person vaccinated get infected 20 people vaccinated getting infected. Non-American redditors 2020-early 2021: ""Lol look stupid pathetic Americans disease ridden shithole, rest world much better you, morons. Get fucked.""

Non-American redditors now: ""Waaaahhhh! America solving problems us? America banning exports? buy vaccines distribute us? dare take extra work compensate horrible COVID response! America hoarding REEEEEEEEE!!!” lot right making show nothing. Right they’re acting like you’re gonna need vaccination card everything isn’t true you’re probably gonna need travel internationally. Serious question. revel fact countries done well? sometimes seems way collective guilt allowing hundreds thousands citizens die needlessly breeds amazing cognitive dissonance great news Israel reaches world wants reach domino effect occur please inform Anti-Vaxxers Israel yeah, best I've found far. really annoys people look vaccine efficacy rates get vaccine (for example pfizer) 95% chance getting covid, vs IO get J&amp;J 70% chance. 

Vaccine efficacy hard explain extremely easy misinterpret stay home March April last year, worked home everyday bliss! commute could get almost work done home could office.

When office opened again, made arrangement come 3 days work home 2 days strike balance needing come things required office visit working home. one said anything like that. Keep extremism table join conversation. Okay, aside, Cornell really fuck load cappella groups. Why? Way catch canada! Yep. need get point, hope don’t take many vaccinated folks them. We're spiking Pittsburgh :( risk dying clot higher dying COVID certain age groups. age groups shouldn’t take chance. Duh... They're building one SK France EVER control?? hurt stupid painless? What’s hilarious Osaka testing Tokyo does. Obviously Tokyo undertesting deliberately, wonder why... I’m super sure money olympics nothing that. government wouldn’t prioritise greed lives! introverted people sometimes like social wish amount energy mental preparation makes nearly impossible Australia huge numbers international visitors.  Havong political force hotel quarantine, limit arrivals track trace outbreaks difference.

Covid failure countries failed basic things paid price - doesn’t anything geography. meningitis shot even required school. get sign waiver. went get shot Dr. One day, made appointment specifically it. Get shot available day since going back, signed waiver. True, good point totally healthy Sadly, even one aunts ""works hospital"" big believer working. might persistent honestly. I'll look someone trust honestly. Maybe get dad convince her. Thanks tip. Might work. confirm. won’t get all. likely reach herd immunity soon places. Omfg, changed literally everything! Good America! Money well spent study. better way explain article ""duh"". literally idea issues long term effects vaccines. 

FDA hasn’t approved yet. 

Also, wife’s reaction vaccine worse fathers reaction getting Covid. 

Not everyone everyone’s body different. don’t know lot yet. 

I got it. also state hit herd immunity June. reasonable position. Us reasonable people ""in middle"" like get scorn ridicule wanting complete data. give credit mass mobilization made even getting vaccine available, think unreasonable thought wait literally months worth testing relatively small focus groups (vs. intended target audience...i.e. world) done. Well hopefully database piece paper source? lmao Well people allow mutations propagate could screw us leads back unfortunate truth Carlin's Law: imagine ""average"" intelligence, realize half world stupider that.

I'd love see ""you take mask off"" incentive get vaccinated help push anti-vaxxers, dumbasses ruin they'll fake vaccine cards similar nonsense get around it. Saw one coming mile away. Soon it’ll jobs everyone returns say next Christmas break... Obviously everyone different effects COVID lockdowns restrictions. extrovert though, I’ve felt energized felt connected individuals larger impact me. nice able reach ask people doing. Respectfully, disagree. think vaccine going it’s job. three currently used US show good effectiveness variants. probably they’re intelligent you. China publish locations bio weapons labs? actually feel kinda guilty much easier it’s socially acceptable focus want focus on! vaccine fully available every come may, currently track every adult wants vaccine able fully vaccinated end summer. thing holding herd immunity children (who vaccine approved yet) anti vaxxers. 

Vaccines fully distributed available every college age adult. choose get one choosing remove society won’t able internationally travel, enjoy big gatherings go back life pre covid. 

Israel using vaccine passport month don’t problem it. Vaccinated people gone concerts go restaurants. Yep, I'm Houston seems nobody stopped protocols here, masks far eye see. received Pfizer shots. Feeling good everything now. Spreading deadly disease isn’t right No. Pfizer. Pfizer testing symptomatic illness. also think people jumping every list makes worse, too. Well, seems, Colorado. incredibly huge piece shit. pretty irrational though given entire world vaccine race. EU actually restricted exports, keeping eye companies particular AZ. free go another school business Meningitis-B Efficacy ≠ Effectiveness.

Efficacy studies, controlled scenarios, effectiveness real world conditions.

95% 1 20, like slot machine, individual's ""pull handle"" lowers risk, still lot room overall level error.

That understanding anyway.  Oh god, repeatedly mentioned millenia. tile /r/shitamericanssay generations alongside stuff think saved world personally pay healthcare military countries something hesitation anyone lead many people waiting ending Johnson Johnson, wont nearly good mRNA. Quite catch 22 highest rank army?  think it’s Cornell implement requirement fall semester, recurring donation I’d like consider agreeing to. Cornell got authorization provide vaccines, set aside money travel students need drive hour Binghamton/Syracuse. Everyone qualify vaccine beginning next week. Aight fam enough fucking around, time call osmosis jones Meanwhile UK we're chugging AstraZeneca basically dare EU legal? look forward stratification bottom fuckwits Somehow trumpies gonna complain freedom students already required show proof vaccination many things kidding? depressed. could universal flu... really possible, saRNA (a boosted mRNA) could ticket short lag manufacture large quantities - direct sequence. saRNA potent, several ug vaccine dose could pack several vaccines it. news: water us wet, sky blue, Australia lost war emus. Well that's vaccine going right? would upsetting know. People weird. Weren’t also testing asymptomatic cases tho recent one?  vaccines readily available time.

If covid vaccines fully distributed someone better academic results vaccinate turned someone less academic fortitude already got vaccinated, problematic. least unfair.  Ok 99.99%. place pretty embarrassing time now. ""OPEN APPLEBEES!"" crowd strong. reasonable! names sound familiar, think may ordered one point. Pandemic hits sudden everyone pretends like actually celebrate easter “But variant – dubbed “double mutant” Indian media — carries two worrisome mutations key part virus help latch onto cells.

Binary factor taRNA combined electrophoresis could also make possible target specific tissues push stronger selective mucosal immunity. Lots excellent things - lot great T-cell responses well. bet saRNA could get Malaria - Yale working something rev T-cells like never Malaria.

Future looks bright. Thank Captain Obvious pronounced colonel highest rank military Nope. None. but...I told FLu bRo! know know, still hate though. Ah, see Canada seems trouble right now, hate. vaccination rate low, supply woes. new variants field day taking whole families. Cornell's ivy? /s Yup that's work saying. Can't really require fully approved. fair game like vaccine.

There hold outs want get think approved fast. We’re trying! That’s pretty much point right? Continue keep behavior normalized reach herd immunity. likely be. isn't, feel quite unfair possibility attend university even vaccinate better academic record someone vaccinated people say that, never chance get Cornell introverts understand Oceania gang checking in: every Western country could bitten bullet year ago done did.

Meh dorky antisocial losers flipped script really Consider high effectiveness vaccine studied people vaccine, bit also everybody wearing masks. effectiveness almost certainly lower everybody wear masks. much lower know. Getting vaccinated reason remove mask. case numbers drop last Spring consider removing masks public.

Music theory also taught using set rules established 17th century, examples match. Classical music already seen inaccessible elitist - nth degree. personal conjecture (also someone attended “elite” institution way many cappella groups size) since cappella groups arrange music, without people strong musical background (music lessons expensive) strong understanding music theory able make musical arrangements, it’s much harder pull group together. makes sense. Anyone refusing get vaccine point idiot. Spanish flu deadly. Man rational animal, rationalizing animal. -- Robert A. Heinlein

He want wear mask- reason gave wearing one bullshit rationalization protect/facilitate want. know viruses latch well covid receptors? fan coincidences, pointing FCS receptor outbreak located near bio facility, seems way many coincidences.

Too bad don’t think ever find truly thing came from. I'm exchange student, saying nothing that, universities looking every excuse keep cost cutting measures like closing facilities limiting staff even risks covid clearly over.

What saying one potential excuse universities may end using say ""can't open yet enough people vaccinated safe"", simultaneously refusing mandate people get vaccinated attend, ensuring keep stupid restrictions place awhile. Authoritarianism rise sides political spectrum. pior lockdowns introverts seen us able survive “the world” came along lockdowns social distancing contactless others, proves resilience introverts isolations, likely survive mentally governor Florida fuckwit.

Post history One main reasons countries switching one-shot strategy know one shot works know immunity short-lived. Er...proof?  use HCQ needed to? Pfizer shot excellent, 100% effective avoiding death. Covid deaths Israel people fully vaccinated. fully scientific looks 97% effective preventing Covid death cases likely caught greater one week second Pfizer shot. still quite excellent coverage 100%. Yeah that's requiring app phone saying vaccinated order go bar... Source? .... Money buy anything.  huge numbers international visitors.

Not many. much easier Australia close international borders many countries going drive businesses well too.

Health insurance unvaccinated employees going go cost. Workman's comp costs go employees getting sick.

No vax? (And valid medical exemption) job. 

For record, disagree all.  science says otherwise? mean like way said beginning masks work. fucking nailed it. :) Nah, young dieing too. Mostly mutations I've seen. scientific basis individual level. Allowing vaccinated people meet cause spread therefore deaths unvaccinated people start meeting (unvaccinated people generally young going watch old mingle can't). Saying one meet better society whole, rather risk particular individuals. people accept fair Yep, people ask themselves, what's likely:

- for-profit companies saw business opportunity lifetime decided correct approach would throw caution wind neglect usual safety testing procedures tiny bit earlier releasing product would likely gigantic market many years come, knowing single safety issue would permanently cripple ability sell market given heavy competition

or

- for-profit companies saw business opportunity lifetime decided make every effort possible ensure produced safe effective vaccine guaranteed reap benefits many years come

And that's completely ignoring relevant point, main reasons vaccines usually take long time develop are:

1. enough funding actual science
2. internal corporate bureaucracy blocking way prioritizing things
3. enough funding trials
4. enough humans willing take part trials
5. government bureaucracy blocking way prioritizing things
6. enough demand vaccine justify large-scale production

and, obviously, one things problem time around. Weird things would move along quickly! pay people more. Theres reason home aide gets paid $1hr NJ. people job education experience trusting authority. Best thing pay people incentive required work. It’s judt good health, good business represents sample 0.01%. There's reason people hear much a) statistically insignificant, B) acts disincentive getting vaccine Nobody likes rich guy wins. US rich guy. We're supposed win. let say want shrug off. Americans used great that. Aspirin Gatorade? Wow. Ridiculous  necessary people understand COVID take initially totally healthy young person quickly put critical condition well possibly kill them. 

Physicalizing possibilities real example allows people put someone else's similar shoes understand severity going around them. 

Sure, taken far, example like seems healthy educational. appear commenter far actually bothered read article. supposed know bullshit truth? doesn’t transmit outdoors. don’t wear outside update suspenseful. okay dude? crazy even everyday people (like you) think important fixed deadlines benchmarks order people feel convinced covid thing end, reason making sacrifices. Meanwhile, top ""doctors"" can't seem use heads connect dots basic psychology help lessen spread virus temporarily. KEY WORD: Temporarily. People, unsurprisingly, want go back normal none ""until notice"" bullcrap gonna last much longer. People tired. want light end hellish tunnel. really sad see people used follow rules protocols start give risk health, completely get coming from. cases Covid par average year influenza.

THANK YOU. people thinking covid magically 0 cases never happen. People need start realizing vaccines eradicate covid, simply lessen amount people suffer severe cases manageable level. 

I'm glad see people starting put pressure governments health officials comes covid protocols plans, easy keep delaying end nightmare. keep receiving hefty paychecks throughout pandemic countless amounts people lost livelihoods. feel like doctors feel sense urgency get shit with. I'm still going listen say, know long everyone else “How able work bar mask still get COVID?”

You can’t dense. There’s way. link talks airway mucosal membranes, yeah, disinfecting anyone's lungs. 

But given evidence respitory illnesses allergies, unlikely they'll find large effects. little help symptoms plausible. Home steam application risk burns doubt widely recommended.   still can’t believe US gets JJ doses EU - millions. least EU could exchanged AZ. Fauci still saying right thing, know phrase exactly. Leaves wanting more, idk. Lol, right? begins... That's precisely it. vaccine company reported effective 10 14 people sampled (or even 13 14), data would picked apart. scare story headline seems perfectly acceptable. Well that's NYT you. actual vendetta. Cornell doesn’t give fuck anyone unless affects reputation. covid policies carbon copies NYS guidelines, don’t really enforce. Tompkins County able put stats every day 5pm. Cornell takes 3 days, says fuck come Friday-Sunday. 

Just nasty emails university president people socially distancing new cluster breaking out. recent one don’t complete form they’ll cut Wifi within 24 hours among things. I'm getting vaccinated, going places require unless to.

I trust ap private company give data establishment keep themselves. Why? seen anything worked privacy tech last year? flash vaccine card copy something sure, data get. believe going steal data naive. article day “inside Pfizer plant Belgium“, quoted representative “232 million doses left plant world“. 
This shows much EU really exports, even half went them. That’s true.[workplace require vaccination Hmm interesting take. don’t think you’re right ok That's high, yeah. know anecdotal live L.A. (too) know one person got it. kid worked register bakery/cafe whole time two people get infected, months apart, one else bakery did. shut immediately times everyone tested.

I think hotspots (Pacoima especially bad) bring percentage up, still areas many people get infected. could probably identify median income. 

I go near pier either yet. family made far, chance now? Canada's would take till July 14th. things going get turned FAST. got 8.5M doses since beginning, next 120 days we're getting 44.9M doses (53.4M total). That's 516K doses day average June 30th, we're averaging 186K day. longer takes hit 516K day, higher average doses per day remaining becomes. spend half time till June 30th getting 186K day, we'll receiving 846,183 day half. First, introvert think ill extroverts. awesome important part society. us think way.

Second, another example people demonizing introverted lifestyle. read study? Introverted peoples' mental health improved. Mentally unhealthy people would definition mentally healthy. Astra zeneca CHOSE make profit. Big difference. problem people pushing nuance super inconsistent public announcements issues. School checked scan ap phone whenever go store restaurant know it. cult;
Wear mask.
Social distance.
Vaccinate.
Drink kool aid.
...feel free add list, wanted get started even though? Cause Cruz anti vax trump least occasionally said people get vaccinated. Also considering Cruz graduated magna cum laude Harvard law think pretty safe say need buy way ivy league school. Also also, even *were* poster children point one actually completely disprove point, two examples prove anything. 

It really sound like started conclusion anti-vaxers uneducated Cruz shit worked way back freaks requiring covid vaccine living rock whole lives 

The covid vaccines still 3rd stage trials. perfectly rational wait scientific experiment conclude taking vaccine. 4 solos, Broccoli Rob 3. Aced classes, called Ace. got straight Bs, called Buzzed. know called bonor champ? sex snowman 3 hours. latest anti-vaxx line? 

The answer yet, that’s requirement vaccine requirement pandemic. Indeed rate Coronavirus well version here. Think UK flu kills 10-15k year. Well personally want people infect people especially older generation it, I'd rather selfless. Yeah...and often happen?

Also think bouncers going chill requirement sure cause physical altercations them? Lol no.

You're overestimating many people give shit. Last I’ll comment it’s nice rub somebody’s nose much, we’ve hit 3 million doses day, said couldn’t happen late April “at earliest.” insisted supply issues wouldn’t sorted til Summer. 

I wouldn’t kept coming back except adamant sure really annoyed me. There’s life lesson somewhere. 

Good luck you. necessarily fire could force wear hazmat suits condition continue working refuse COVID vaccine.

Many health care setting pre-COVID would require employees wear mask get flu shot. (single) introvert know it’s permanent things return back normal means dating conventional put Looks like we're missing Alabama, Mississippi, fuckin Texas, Arizona, Hawaii, Indiana (that's state, I'm pretty sure), North Virginia, Florida even though list. US really insane. 

I pretty sure flu vaccinations mandatory anywhere Europe, maybe except healthcare professionals, think even them.

Flu low morbidity rate, comparable yellow fever, smallpox, etc, vaccines reasonable. show muslims problem Never?

[US send 4m vaccine doses Canada Good know. guess another one policies turned lie. *paused* 55. continue pause, they'll used second doses received first. orders something around 22,000,000 end September—so around 11,000,000 people's worth. course, 11M people 55 Canada, decent chunk received vaccine already, also return 1.5M America lent us presumably somewhere around Q3. 

Regardless, matter do, we'll doses administer end (unless turns inoculation persistent past 6 months, case may glad them). always going case we've known since even placed orders vaccines. needed order large amounts vaccines order hedge bets know which, any, would work out—and work out, needed large orders secure vaccines faster. time FDA grants actual approval EUA.
For example Astrazeneca unlikely get EUA point, emergency declining. pandemic declaration EUAs expire can't give vaccines anymore. teaching person year wear KN95s day. got covid yet (and I'm one shot vaccinated). watched test videos online quite bit research...I wish article would months ago. honestly wish y’all could come join. states already seeing hesitancy. I’d much rather lovely Canadabros Hopefully start exporting 50m doses month neighbors May think lesson EU India they're going figure whole process indigenously push comes shove Go school get vaccination. That’s it’s done. Wait second. You’re telling MuH VaRIANts!!11!1 narrative overblown media bullshit drive clicks!?!? Say ain’t so! think could part issue approaches fraud frankly arguably crosses line stuff. require students full vaccinated host diseases well. another box check health services form filled docs registering freshman. Az never manufactured vaccine involved vaccine. would much better corporate reputation stayed one.  dream last night walked store forgot mask realized I'm fully vaccinated care also realized half people store wearing either. Hopefully omen things come 😁 Quite folks spoken Paris actually want vaccine, available. media ageist. print news story every young person gets sick, old people do. 

Screw them. Old people people deserve treatment. would media focus young people? agree people say they're bored they've even tried anything explored could do, annoys me. also understand people mental capacity something taxing learning new language, that's really hard thing do. lot people said struggle concentrate mental stress pandemic, get that. Looking back past year, definitely times keeping distracted anxiety whole situation, exactly anything super difficult mentally. \~6mo first lockdown...the 2 ""lockdowns"" since theater best. That's reason fine health institutions taking time approve vaccines factories. Cutting cirners tempting now, rules place reason. Well really wont ever know safe vaccine cause drug world MFG liable damages nobody sue them.

So say vaccine causes infertility cancer etc.. media isnt board general public never know it. realize take part trial. people big mad mandating vaccinations. right rights violated? difficult you’re stupid amazing what's discovered created short time, motivation there. small group dedicated people made vaccines happen (scientists, technicians bureaucrats)... done spite millions knuckle dragging, useless dipshits whatever sabotage success.

This isnt national character national pride. vaccine success pulled relatively small number individuals every human planet part, masking up, trying social distance aware actions war. people one side, dipshits other. transcends borders. forget takeaway alcohol banned IDF today. Now, anyone enforce real question. No, one forcing anyone. still walk packed offices see workers day day, obviously made telework 4 days week. Get ahold legit n95 masks stay vigilant. Interesting. 

Do think AstraZeneca profit motive, would done better? Like, fact they’re sold cost real reason failed badly? left uses forum downright scared people faking cards, clearly motives using appointment reminders, right? 

I know talking points right “Omg, vaccine passports aren’t thing, one wants that!” actions sure speak differently. Note: Professor Racaniello AMA April 8 1pm. even hobbies prior pandemic, ample opportunities find something like. loads hobbies require little investment enjoyed right home, safely. 

And let's forget: self-improvement always option. year now. could've learned another foreign language example. Libraries started offering sorts free online courses learn handy skill. fought Covid, other? Casadevall joins TWiV discuss use convalescent plasma treat COVID-19, including history process, plasma prepared tested, difficult conduct randomized clinical trials, treatment fared hopes future. wait another week that, vaccine protection takes bit time take effect. pfizer #2 Friday morning. Side effects knocked ass. Honestly, never dealt anything injection site swelling vaccine. Finally starting feel back normal now. definitely able work Friday night/Saturday favor call off. experience side effects, consider lucky enjoy free time. Besides sore arm, experienced chills, fatigue, headache. take temperature assume fever sweating. could get comfortable enough sleep 4 hours Friday night. Side effects mostly felt like typical sickness, without coughing. trial, would 100% certain placebo, that's sure! Moderna Pfizer starting trials age groups 6 months 11 years, well 12-18 (Pfizer 11-15) I'd expect get emergency use well. 
Also, Texas university health system, giving vaccines us college students since everyone 16, eligible, uses Pfizer.

Sources: free country

That's point, it. *not* free country I'm denied service due health condition.

And that's contemplate *validity* data might used make potential denial-of-service decisions... 

When vaccinated, provide ID prove identity. given shot record contained date vaccine name filled form. form printed paper easily counterfeited. bode well basis solid system used make important decisions might allowed might allowed go... numbers I've seen media suggest 60% - 70% percent needed herd immunity, says new variants number high 80% - 90%. 

I see 25%-30% would mean anything.  No, tested efficient preventing handling virus *assumed should* reach least 6 months, they’re estimating might well reach 1 year even longer, can’t say sure go one month time based long person actually vaccinated.

So far they’re right 6 months since it’s 6 months, time tell reaches longer, well tbh, can’t legally claim *will* reality hasn’t caught point yet.

Still, it’s exactly said would it’s working fantastically atm. Well, here's hoping feeling bit better. summer's around corner vaccinations picking up, least we're seeing light end tunnel :-) Yeah, are, sociable work, can’t talk cashier neighbors, freak don’t talk people.  know medical trial. would never approved following standard rules. Covid roll used government exucitive order emergency usage make legal manufacturers free clear legal liability. recently eased weekend lockdown means everyone house travelling municipalities. interesting see leads considering case numbers breaking records last weeks Ditto. I've learned say ""yeah, hard everyone"" whenever someone complains me. extroverts reaaaaaallly like hearing us introverts enjoying (some of) pandemic. live extroverted world, get enjoy forced discomfort experience.

Now get wrong, things miss - like going movie theater see new movie, going plane spotting, enjoying museum. interactions choose, ones forced upon me. Yeah, think UK right pissed getting doses, EU pissed getting theirs.

The problem cases AZ over-promised under-delivered. I’ve read idle plant too, spare capacity, it’s near 40-50M/month needed. That’s majority EU doses filled Takeda plant Germany. uhh can’t tell you’re trolling I’ll leave here. BBC covered pandemic criticism responses throughout, often much else news. host diverse heated debate grill politicians routinely.

This doesn’t really need saying. I'm pretty sure Americans would agree you. workers though! 14 million 83 million 4 months vaccination program

Ouch tell good giving constructive criticism.  basically saying vaccine wasnt tested first roll trial ? produced Netherlands. Yes, 'fileld finished' US, IDLE plant (certified job) could thing half hour distance production plant. killer sure April challenging. Netherlands already see extremely positive effects vaccination: Death 4x lower winter peak January cases vaccinated population 16x peak. It’s remarkable really, gives reason optimism. apparently they’re allowing “religious exemptions.”

Does kind defeat point, since, last year shown us anything people whip cite whatever “law” “code” read online (that doesn’t actually exist) (attempt to) excuse wearing masks, etc?

Remember viral videos people going maskless places saying wild shit like “according Phil vs Bill 1948 penal code 4 - 678.89 - 27 medically religiously exempt mask wearing public right blah blah blah.” imagine easy types people simply claim “religious exemption” chill side side class. 

Of course assuming worst, idea easy. Unfortunately, might need wait middle summer, check last year southern states surge repeats tself. already see repeat last year spring surge northern states, despite significant inroads vac.  might be, seems government planning exemptions vaccinated people starting 15 days second dose. obviously base presumptions data mRNA vaccines came last week. get worried rules would also apply vaccinated AZ. could imagine might end complicated (and unpopular) AZ-vaccinated would exempted 'privilege'. We'll see. like foundations geopolitics intended Username checks out. inconceivable someone would care people community, themselves. data Fauci. agree. think April hard, may things start look much better Long term effects? Tying health care systems treating Covid? Deaths poor lagging metric. It’s one time test. meant last. It’s annoyance. I’m allowed annoyed. literally wear mask take trash. built national vaccine notification system us. It’s vaccine.monal.im scans vaccine appointment sites major pharmacies state sites every 15 min sends alert phone. grew coronavirusma it’s national .  nytimes article also Experts vaccine manufacturing said past, F.D.A. rule prevent mishaps allowing facility make two live viral vector vaccines, potential mix-ups contamination.

Seems like rules written reason. Pandemic reason try break rule work (human error) give shit thousands killed year due depression? also problem wearing mask  
My skin point can’t handle anymore. 

That...sounds like problem wearing mask. I'm jealous reading guys getting vaccines whatnot normal, functioning countries. 

Meanwhile failed state, covid worse ever we, regular people navigating blind fuck authoritarian governement iron clad grip kind information. Also vaccination plan sight general population ruling party politicians military already vaccinated lol Clinical trials vaccine won’t done 2023. fun one.. Buying vaccines isn’t remotely funding development manufacturing. Maybe mandates gone many businesses probably require yet. universities also already saying they'll require masks fall 2021. know severe relatively common long term effects COVID, argument bad.  need police phrase means exactly thing? like saying ""... Doses Asia"" actually mean China. Saying getting doses EU implies many countries EU so, single country.

But know Americans issues world map finding countries US it, can't really mad 😊 still needed boosters next years. virus mutation go away soon. Rip european homies can't get vaccines. science tells us ""immunity"" getting covid across board worse vaccines basically useless newer variants (unlike vaccines), especially got mild case. Hope things get better soon! said, imagine it’s like introverts year prior..... coworker's husband bragging going buy one online $200, like dude free get shot... US vaccinal hubris. Thank fantastic explanation! Glad it’s 15 million 30 million doses wasted. day mask mandate lifted finally comes, I’m going tossing masks. don’t understand people willingly continuing wear mask fun (because never want cold again). quote office fuck ups AZ?  Hm, like don’t miss it. Absolutely love getting lost crowd don’t care ever get again... Reading comprehension....low. Congrats! European countries must feel even awkward. Yep, question cause I’m introvert mood quality life up. yellow fever card needed go watch footie, Covid passport will.  Same. I’m never bored left devices. also don’t even think I’m introvert, grew left guess played role. significant amount early cases last spring, testing limited back then. They're 21st deaths per capita. Itks catch-22. Unvaccinated people meet together ALREADY meeting. message tells people ""Get vaccine!.....but changes nothing, stay locked lonely."" Misinformation local, good luck getting timely manner. There's nothing fundamentally racist liking particular regime particular country. makes seem like chinese bot explanation new wave? remember serology studies major urban areas India showing upwards 60% sero-positive rates, meaning nearing natural herd immunity levels first wave, plus vaccinating millions per day.

Are new variants spreading able re-infect previously exposed individuals something? case, may cause renewed waves infection even places like US/Israel/UK many people vaccinated. really no.  Vector = specific adenovirus you’re using carry spike cell.

You don’t grow heaps adenovirus vector try splice spike instructions every single one.

You create small amount seed stock - adenovirus spike vaccine inserted.  grow big vat (until you’ve got enough turn vaccines).

I’m actually sure created AZ adenovirus JJ spike instructions it. used fully AZ seed stock (AZ adenovirus AZ spike instructions) put JJ vat.  either way screw-up must’ve happened growing step.  

So AZ perspective, it’s like entire 15 million dose vat supplies lost.  they’ve lost starter batch. It’s possible lost bit unmodified adenovirus.   Sound terrible, wishing strength shall pass. Btw, thread made think - introverts hard time extraverts years year.... Thanks, also article see Jens Spahn saying anything travel.. headline asking question whether would case.. really answered article itself? also make sense AZ since 76% effective first dose second dose keeping long term immunity. removing pro-AZ comments leaving anti-AZ ones? wonder extra contact tracers hired Indy 500. Normally 250,000 fans, even 50% capacity, odds number symptomless infected fans spew aerosols crowd. Unfortunatelly, medicine without side effects. Hell, even get water poisoning (drinking water kill you, certain circumstances).

AZ vaccine kind proved (no connection fatalities vaccine) kill people certain demographics (young women). demographics cause serious side effects 1 100.000).

Probably true vaccines well, connection established. Pfizer Moderna safest vaccines (nothing 100% safe) even 1 fatality (even less 2508) proved caused them. now. might happen later, data. 

So yeah, get vaccinated. young woman unlucky person, avoid AZ vaccine. maybe live warm climate. Probably, enough long term trials know cutoff This. wait sec extraverts bad year introverts forced bad life? wastewater detection proving useful?

Not yet. That’s stupid, surely person going establishment aware risks rather blame place. add egg cake mix? Baking maths... average country like U.S. definitely okay. majority Australia’s planned vaccine procurement local manufacturing facility making OxAz. supply speed vaccination program hugely. imported vaccines available quickly, could exacerbated export restrictions EU, one imported vaccines isn’t approved use yet. translate article example: I'll careful blaming EU for buying Sanofi. 

There saying *Nobody fired buying IBM* Sanofi + GSK is one biggest vaccine manufacturer world, sounded like safe bet, UK US also bet Sanofi.

The real shame, that's economic politic Covid politic Sanofi develop covid-vaccine, fired hundreds R&amp;D people, giving huge dividend stock-owner. seems money given covid vaccine properly used far know functionally major difference far effects go.

There two big things far know. One antibodies (or case example protein specific virus stimulate body manufacture antibodies) similar things fairly delicate, manufacturing inside body removes risk damaging proteins hormones storage transit whereas RNA stable compared lot molecules. 

The bigger thing lot manufacturing processes one sort mRNA injection identical another, point could use single production line lot process multiple injections. Add RNA relatively easy synthesise means cost setting line produce human hormone using current methods could set line could produce multiple batches different medications turn could lead drop price smaller batches unusual uses.

The biggest thing mRNA tech case going logistics, removing lot potential issues storage potatoes set whole new production line every separate vaccine therapy bugs - extraverts don’t want back normal, want force everyone else back normal well. Neither CDC developed tested/approved vaccines. Whether think ""garbage"" irrelevant. Headline sounds like vaccinated privileges vaccinated understand ""liberties"" test negative.

Also, say anything ""free travel allowed""? work independent senior retirement facility(management nurse) half employees declined getting vaccinated.
This includes F/T salary employees, housekeepers, cooks, &amp; waitstaff. it’s “racist”, despite IDs required literally everything else. Cant remember quote it’s something like “you always count America right thing, exhausting every option” doctor know tested positive? realize restrictions bars right ? worked day. area many people wore masks did. Still got it. dont shit 😂. Socialising exhausting introvert...but actually like socialising, too. high-energy cost activity usually worth miss long run.

Check privilege. Many poorer nations relying cheapest easiest store transport vaccination many supplies happily let millions vaccines sit storage. Right? Saying miracle insulting many people worked tirelessly make happen, vaccine researchers people administering vaccines people looking spreadsheets emails coordinate rollout. profit motive, think experienced company AZ would partnered Oxford? Pfizer rejected US funding.  Modern accepted also agreed doses made USA weren’t going exported US allowed it.

So ... Canada supposed offer fund? Pfizer would’ve said no. Moderna already contracted US.  AZ licensing deals Canada didn’t manufacturing capacity make it. shaming whom? Alcohol famous crutch introverts, also. say introvert. 100 unvaccinated people infected would 5 vaccinated people get infected.

This seems source discrepancy (correct) technical definition (incorrect) popular definition. popular definition mistakenly assumes 100% attack rate.  It’s quote Office character everyone else referencing. offense, it’s incredibly ignorant believe people identify political party choice smart enough go Ivy League college. Believe not, Reddit real world Good cause guys douche Also, watch swipe credit cards buy things Walmart sure article. reason stopping Oxford vaccine produced due mistakes made Emergent making vaccine Janssen. nothing AZ. reason wrong company questionable competence pull given lack experience vaccines think AstraZeneca profit motive, would done better?

That's happened Chile hospitals became competely overwhelmed they've go lockdown again. detect hostility post. Wow. I'm even going touch question obvious stretching win showing prejudice even taking there. people ask question obviously already class system mind they're top. want claim (as EU appearing do) also needs acknowledged UK exported EU even doses sent back UK fill finish. 

I don’t agree either think issue lack consistency. Claiming export vaccines mainly produced UK denying UK exported anything smacks politics misinformation. wrong company.

Why? company willing offer cost. Yeah, friends like they're fun. fun world dictated attitude It’s possible people fully vaccinated could get Covid-19

This infuriating. Yes, possible, vaccines 100% effective. unlikely. making policy something incredibly unlikely make sense.

It possible someone sub choke death muffin morning. ban muffins? Something tells Shopify ignore demands. customers sell sorts things illegal USA law USA citizens.

Come lol about? solid idea direction head things like would picked well advance possibility, shit wouldn’t fly. don’t think MAJOR side effects coming would heard GENUINE possibilities right now.

AKA people improve godawful attention spans keep electing fools There’s room debate questions sub. Sensitive sensitive... oh well. Thanks sharing confusion well. study. CDC director spoke broadly, CDC clarified don’t know yet. Walensky spoke broadly interview,” agency spokesman told Times. “It’s possible people fully vaccinated could get Covid-19. evidence isn’t clear whether spread virus others. continuing evaluate evidence.” everyone chance get vaccinated- understand lasting immunity variants.
 Disease 1.5 years old. Vaccines like .5. know much better tread lightly push forward.

It's interesting y'all want compare skin tone religion, existing vaccines/health measures (mmr vaccine, wearing pants example). think makes stronger argument really shows grasping anything make rights people's rights/ businesses rights HEALTH matter. also assuming every business would require high risk ones. done that....still symptoms covid hospitalisation near death experience, many thousands still suffer symptoms....me 4 months later many first outbreak year ago, hospital report proves long covid issue needs attention.? Cycling became me. Perfect speed exploring. Pack book coffee flask great. I'm Japan barely started vaccinating medical staff. Anyone college aged vaccinated September guaranteed. feel bad students plans go year. actually 90% 12-14 days... one Sara-cov-1 well adapted human Ace2. Also, receptors product many aspects genome would hard engineer virus targeting them. So, sense factor supports refutes engineered hypothesis. Like you, wish real investigation true answer. UK variant awful, know happened Hungary. caused explosion cases hospitals full young people (18+). Don’t doubt it, she’s talking far. think odds 18 year old dying pandemic low, wait see odds 18 year old dying immunization side-effects. Wow-ee! many parts modern life revealed extraneous bullshit. E.g. majority commuting car mainly invented grind awfulness. Thank Biden! people it. already happening. go dog park every Saturday 2 months ago everyone wore masks, yesterday, 60-70%, especially older people. guessing people get vaccinated stop. makes sense... entire point vaccinated. question whether vaccinated people still spread virus seems completely absurd frankly. studies Moderna, Pfizer, CDC, Israel, others show vaccinated people can't spread virus, Fauci says wants data... much enough? That’s right. Give two weeks, isn’t effective fully then. basketball arena March 29th dead April 2nd? either super sick there, died something else happened covid? seems fast sporting event dead. mean it’s pretty silly allow people believe certain god get allow people personally don’t want get exact outcome. super serious cared much claim would fully enforce rule. Yeah, reasons recommend it, none reasons solid, well-replicated studies backing them. Could give source saying single shot J&amp;J vaccine able get herd immunity?

It probably less effective e.g. 2 dose Pfizer Moderna, could well matter vaccine used, long enough people vaccinated. Single shot J&amp;J gives least time giving possible 2nd dose. It’s much faucci I’m worried get he’s conservative precautionary statements. It’s (and I’ll preface way trump guy believe conspiracy stuff) media generally trying get viewership readership. People watch CNN take panicked tone gospel let shape behavior data new studies paint different picture never talked about. Well, look statistics many people died Covid vs getting vaccine instantly answer. you’re seriously worried take blood thinners guess. scared. worst odds 1 100k - nothing keep night. sustainable. Colleges amenities attract retain students parent's wallets. nothing pisses alumni like ending clubs/programs fond memories of. 

From I've seen schools kids currently attending, things back normal fall, already. 

Right parent/family FB pages filled ""my child accepted - tell enroll here"" type queries. Colleges monitor groups. parent (who mainly lurks pages) I've received multiple letters admin addressing specific complaints get lot traction groups. It’s sad Ratliff kid super fan Alabama basketball team passed away 23 covid, whole life ahead him. idea “we’ve vaccinated elderly, let infections wash rest us,” completely wrong. deadly dangerous virus, clearly includes younger age groups. way early opening back like normal. need continue covid precautions cases back minimal levels.

I’m just... sad. didn’t happen. one damn stadium right now! NH, opened 16+ Friday. governor announced sites Pfizer available 16+. large sites always available second doses anyway, choose first doses based available. everywhere. r/Ireland full people want open everything straight away despite nowhere near enough vaccinated. There's also marked shift react people congregating large groups. Previously would've completely condemned mostly ""good them.""

I know people impatient want open back we're numbers still fairly high increase they're loosened lot. else would call them? product leaving EU. mean export? 

Of course, UK exporting AZ EU first, claiming means EU can't export refinement like saying Samsung exported Congo, produce raw cobalt something. That’s already walked back CDC. know parents live GA it’s there. miss going walks nice breeze face. understand seeming little extra. It’s everyone here! Brazil UK strains fight among other. probably one (more transmissible) become dominant strain. know bunch musicians also sports. possibilities limitless Thanks man, reason automoderator blocked that's see posts! Brazilian president, Brazil going become Covid-19 heaven. That’s like saying I’d rather take chances eating hamburger vs playing traffic downvoted Vaccines good efficacy Variants back, wasn’t allowed residence chicken pox vaccine. one kids never caught it. every statement completely absolute. true kids much less affected virus 80-90% fatalities elderly. mean pretend nothing ever happened. means that, vaccinations, risk changed considerably.

Society lived active viruses infections since long societies around. always sent kids school knowing exposed everyone else's germs, bring illnesses home, parents grandparents get them. flu, chicken pox, mono, etc. always considered risk acceptable continued send kids school anyway.

For whatever reasons true covid. point change. never disappear completely, virus active world somewhere rest humanity. point enough vaccinations enough at-risk people protected decide ok resume normal society. Guys, I'm terrified. 

A week ago wife got first shots AstraZeneca vaccine. last Thursday, EMA gave statement vaccines safe. ones available us time. Day got jabs, news starts coming blood clots caused AZ vaccine. 

I've quietly freaking past 10 days, watching signs symptoms, especially wife. We're 30s. 

We scheduled booster shot June I'm seriously debating whether go not. 

How scared be? Yep . go away soon article says share details totally healthy patient. Yeah, somehow folks, individuals wearing masks infringing freedom. It’s maddening. Phizer seem get much media coverage Moderna given close efficacy rates 94 95 percent? Love reply removed mentioning politics you’re one brought up.  I'm sorry went that. know probably take opinions seriously, still must tough accused abusing child, especially many people spew evil nonsense. sick. people literally sick. agree, crisis shown friends really are. first time life favor withdrawal NATO. time million elderly Europe would anything get shot can’t US refuse export vaccines. EU would get 75.000.000 doses countries like US UK would block exports. 
At time EU exported 70.000.000 doses, including millions JJ doses going US EU. Running oxygen soon? Lol come on. try make point dramatic it. mean, don’t go outside stayed home since last year. don’t want go college something lost efficacy &amp; going described. That’s 2/3 country. can’t find doses anywhere near me.  FAR likely die car accident die falling stairs issues AZ. Yep first big statement feeling ""impending doom"" went script teared up, next day Fauci said see 4th wave coming. Then, says ""data suggests"" vaccinated people can't spread virus, Fauci puts statement saying he's waiting scientific data.... seems like need talk.  2 deaths many millions? Hopefully we’ll really see fall cliff may never said good plan 🤣 

And never said anything Biden. point CDC federal agency HHS could done prepare eventual rollout vaccination program, includes management/production vaccine card. “Under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness full immunization (≥14 days second dose) 90% SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless symptom status”

It’s literally abstract...

The statement walking back safe travel statement, 90% infection prevention. wanted walk back would take study, website Got first vaccine shot scheduled days. Hopefully working boosters road well. cue *vAcCiNeS wOrK* crowd  disinfect groceries buying sunny day putting sunlight 30 minutes side dry goods 10 refrigerated/frozen AstraZeneca GSK already people get symptoms. mother 69 years old, overweight diabetes, heart kidney issues tested positive last winter symptom bit headache days. vaccinated, would care someone else isn't. That's got vaccinated right? thinking really make sense you? makes sense. protected, concerned others bodies? logic seems completely disappearing humanity. mind-boggling. Yup. headline makes sound likebit AZ’s fault, though, rather slimy corrupt Emergent BioSolutions.  Ahh final admissions test. Students upset policy business Cornell.  ""loaned"" doses Canada Mexico repaid doses later.  One state 50 surge bad. vaccination rates massively outpacing infection rates think Michigan got unlucky timing. month half country received least one dose vaccine, it’s possible surge like winter everywhere happens. thing EU aren’t claiming that. aren’t including extra wording would make technically correct. claiming UK exports nothing EU exported doses UK. leaving mainly produced UK it’s lying omission. 

It’s EU add extra vaccines export numbers avoiding reality produced UK even implying produced fully EU (as case Pfizer). like ""reduces chance [] 95% exposed."" 

the reason say 'contracting covid' studies symptomatic cases, others tested regularly asymptomatic cases.

the reason ""if exposed"" get number comparing many people got sick placebo group versus vaccinated group, assume people exposed rate (which might actually been, rough estimate). exposed, obviously chance lower, repeatedly exposed long term chance getting higher. Considering still 75% inpatient capacity, 72% ICU doubt it. high. sure get information from, I’m seeing it. Full reopening planned late summer early fall. meant future broadway factory built US government entrusted Emergent last year. government giveth, government taketh away. plenty places even (even large cities, like Houston) get appointment quickly now. hasn’t way now- rural areas, maybe- still hard find populated areas. handing like candy people walking around pharmacy central Houston day, middle day, appt needed. So, others said, shouldn’t problem.  extraverted preferred workstyle costs bottom line talented people take significant paycut wfh elsewhere, many boards understand back coming return work onslaught.  Ya JnJs definition moderate sounds mild me. Like runny nose would considered moderate study. Anything better chain link fencing had. New York State took away religious exemption vaccines 2019, although sure applies staters Cornell traveling abroad, passport routine things public. That’s sounds like bigger issues introversion Noone gives damn Dolly Parton lmao. right plan getting vaccine.

I think part argument take vaccine *other peoples benefit* own. Again, understand hard sell. call anti-vaxxer sentiment would probably call bit selfish. really meant shitty insult, quite literally - risk worth taking vaccine, put concerns needs others. uncommon sentiment even personally disagree choice, relate accept take it. Kids won’t vaccinated another year. bad automod specific removal message sites straight extremist/terrorist. move expect China... US. private companies here, government getting involved. pandemic shown shit gets serious country quickly become monster. Im maaaaan without convictioooon introverted =\= antisocial read that? I’ve read three times now. mention prevention spread virus inactivation vaccinated healthcare workers. fact three fully vaccinated infected. News agency points nobody reading people acting like giving “just 2 months” life big deal entirely disconnected reality. Especially entire logic optics actual disease mitigation. Also I’ve hearing line month now. It’s next two weeks flatten curve. 

Want know states like Colorado pulling back mask mandates? People done. without clear endgame sight governors done giving “just little more” watching states suffer year. got Pfizer shot Friday, arm barely sore today Ah yes, love home state North Virginia. database never going available due HIPAA. pull info get replacement card course can't pull info without permission/knowledge. deaths little 200 per day absolute worst points, “hundreds per day” end week seems like stretch... especially millions highest risk people - *by far* likely get really sick, get hospitalized, die - already vaccinated. Raw “OMG cases!” numbers don’t mean unvaccinated population, don’t mean much spreading among younger population vastly lower risk Covid. dislike much it’s easy “Makes people around comfortable”

So admit it’s feelings, science? efficacy ""any time exposed virus, chance getting sick exposure, calculated based many unvaccinated people vaccinated people study got sick""? 

while know recently, seem complicated me. Absolute rock bottom expectations guess. reassuring hear shouldn’t issue. Yes, continuous lockdowns closures working REALLY well Europe far. vaccination card got literally printed piece post card. name vaccine got date got written pen. nothing anti-counterfeiting. could print home printer assuming post card I'm pretty sure could find office store. high schooler could counterfeit this. League much better pronounced *COR-NELL* *highest rank* *IVY LEAGUE.* again, world isn’t going done vaccinating probably 2023. going epidemic regardless. 

But hey, you’ve proven point, people massive government intrusion want mandate vaccine. know can’t get enough support it, trying accomplish it. Wait hear antibodies. Seriously.

While ACE2 good choice virus can’t mutate around it, antibodies way easier make body keeps evolving virus. Better wait. way maximize chance getting COVID, infecting loved ones strangers, responsible death dozens people. everyone downvoting me...the cdc literally says immunity expected within TWO weeks second dose. local Facebook comments fantastic. anti vaxxers saying would never go there, people dropping straight facts Cornell 11% admission rate see ya later! Astrazaneca British drug maker though 🤦 NYer here. case count high due variant test shitload states. Yesterday, according John Hopkins, new case count 7,775 cases. 7 day positivity rate 3.6%. 

Meanwhile, Florida, higher population NY, 6,017 new cases  also 7 day positivity rate 9.4%, nearly triple NY has.

Don't put blame NY! states undercounting. many aspects kind yeah. aspect specifically. really understand masks work, you? Plus absurd curfew course actually would genuinely beneficial vaccinated people Germany benefits would extend travel - would allow access everyday services much easily. So, example, want go local hardware store state Berlin, need get negative rapid Corona test day 1 180 test centres. put lot older people find website difficult navigate sometimes find free appointments short notice neighborhoods. That's fine me, bike less everywhere actually enjoy getting exercise! older, less techy less mobile people, difficult. already two vaccinations, see to. Yeah. shows MyChart lot Texas providers use without anything me. similar chart uploaded valid info shot provider. J&amp;J vaccine approved EU-wide nearly month ago (March 11th).  didn’t thought like that, thank another intelligence test reading entire thread mind boggling! U.K. unheard three vaccines likely full commercial approval fall classes start. clear, matter like not?

Go Cowboys! entire “plan” get vaccine 1 airport per state. Everything else state.

The Trump administration supposedly goal 20 million vaccinations December 31st. CDC’s vaccine tracker showed 2,794,588 people received first dose morning 31st. That’s difference saying you’re going something actually plan it.

I wonder it’s higher risk unvaccinated students US? (I idea that’s true). Cornell arranging vaccines anyone doesn’t yet, foreign students voice getting vaccinated attending. people like compare numbers unrelated eachother. see 66% effective vaccine herd immunity likely 75%....it's possible reach herd immunity. Reality available vaccines near perfect preventing hospitalizations death (#1 priority).  Thanks!! Really helpful :) I’m pretty sure they’re saying everyone who’s vaccinated stops wearing masks, everyone else find excuse stop wearing masks, they’ll become unenforceable understand cards never meant used official certification anything. mostly appointment reminder, see benefit getting fake one. show proof vaccination dog get nails trimmed Petco. shouldn’t hold pets higher standards children.  That's people field call Keep mind virus still prevalent general population. wait, taking risk could get infected coming months school term even begins. damn tempting! gotta finish contract here, unfortunately.  Oh doh, saw said first doses money end things media, already lost Trump hard time letting go cash cow, Covid 19. inbox NY Times morning:

However, second dose heard rough, I’m kinda dreading that... it’ll worth Sorry see story. young life extinguished far early. could called con man. chose charlatan felt appropriate. highly regarded experts exactly correct. US purchased total 600M combined Pfizer Moderna, vaxing 300M people. pre-purchased 200M J&amp; J single shots. everything gets delivered that's enough fully vax 500M. need AZ, besides, carrying lot baggage, deserved not. 300M doses AZ ordered doubt share, sell donate them. Oh no. That's terrible policy. Iirc quote Winston Churchill, he's kind spot Wow, without gyms open? Wow. Religion protected constitution. Refusing get Vaccine could save others lives isn't. That's point falls apart. tons things protected constitution, choosing get vaccine protected. actually matter though? there's herd immunity, everyone wants protected anti-vaxxers ability get vaccinated, plus herd immunity, there's physical harm small percentage people unvaccinated. could see vaccines effective, they're effective vaccines ever made, think MMR effective.

Young people rarely get symptomatic illness covid mild due lower density ACE2 receptor sites lung tissue. at-risk population vaccinated need experimental drug therapy students. typical recombinant vaccine. medical treatment federal definition. approved emergency use authorization long term safety studies. little animal studies exist SARS vaccines encouraging, although researchers took care target protein order illicit improved specificity antibody response, mean binding antibodies risk. Hopefully cause ADE exposed wild variant next winter. know ADE is, understand wrote, understand medical literature surrounding SARS vaccines. Instructing cells produce viral protein without long term studies consequences immune sensitization reckless. Blind faith government corporate controlled medical system designed profit people admirable intelligent.

The FDA prevented use drug therapeutics covid specifically federal legislation prohibits use vaccines disease effective drug therapies. Ivermectin used world United Sates excluding brave doctors Houston Texas. Bangladesh administering Ivermectin population $0.02 blister packs since June 2020 Covid mortality rate 49/1M population.

People follow mask etiquette public go around friends family without on. people go hangout different friends US allow Pfizer Moderna export doses produced US? plants too. apply benefits you?

I hope EU allow even single dose produced leave US. symptoms? One thing still don’t know sure people spread covid people don’t really. bosses wife caught covid one else household did. don’t symptoms would a) try maintain distance don’t go overboard b) get tested. Either way - depending you’ve done (share food/drink) might exposed didn’t catch (and likely won’t) would isolate confirmed positive. Family attack rate something like 10-30 percent chance might it. lazy trolling. add Q shit make spicier perhaps? talking forcing vaccinations? businesses right choose limit services vaccinated folks only. don’t want vaccine fine don’t get one don’t come store saying. Wow.  never could seen coming. 

I shocked. Yes, seeing well. Lots people around seem trying find J&amp;J shot, saying that’s one get. Shrug last point exactly it. Michigan better job locking down/slowing spread compared states upper mid west and, ironically, suffering lesser immunity due prior infection. article misleading. Regional governments accept rules aim public places costals one already said going enforce fine anyone beach. Florida says wassup peak reddit. 

What's next..""the Internet mistake""? 

Christ. also less issue B117. Okay. bad. Come back home, Patriot what's everyone's symptoms getting vaccine? know symptoms probably covid ever heard them- loss taste ect. 2 confirmed cases time real numbers probably higher. Cruise companies one. dumb many reasons. let people get sick hospitals would gotten slammed death rate would skyrocketed. mention letting virus mutate potential much dangerous version could catastrophic. There’s ton reasons two alone terrible I’m thinking slight uptick shots areas J&amp;J available, it’s easier know find one specifically. I’m Houston area suburb, reason, lot people around seem dead set getting one. want know hell wrong “immunization records” we’ve decades?!?! Harsh! left first place citizenship revoked lol it, yes Cornell right.

Well well well, here? *Consequences*? *my actions*?

I understand many people hard time understanding this. like ""government should't able tell wear mask"" people understanding store upset requiring wear one PRIVATE PROPERTY. Thank God President Biden. big reason US succeeded rollout got president Biden hired competent people experience logistics.

Not really. reason US ahead pretty much every country domestic production ability capacity. Big Pharma something Biden Trump take credit for.  Scientist here, genetic engineering, sound like absolut piece garbage human being. Happy Easter! argument could legitimately see used this, vaccines FDA approved emergency use authorized. It’s military hasn’t required members get yet, merely provided opportunity. one forcing anyone get vaccine. vaccine passport provides electronic documented proof scannable verifiable. Using showing vaccination card. Anyplace go people congregating (movies, concerts, stadiums) requires proof you’ve vaccinated requiring proof keep safe cover asses, take away “freedoms.” they’re planning full herd immunity. masks distancing regulation all. pay really low, yes. Lol could pandemic ended last year genius? stupid Reddit takes live for. vaccine won’t help end pandemic end soon could’ve ended last year locked inside homes 9 months. I’ve often wondered sun hasn’t helped Florida Texas imagined beginning pandemic kept steak knife spray bottle disinfectant porch; we'd cut boxes open, dump contents, put box recycling, disinfect knife inner packaging bringing inside. done months now. pain, better safe sorry data yet. That’s two months ago. continue learn protection studies done. becoming apparent vaccines greatly reduce transmission. 

Of course beginning said keep wearing mask - didn’t know yet. best err side caution uncertainty.

But yes, initial goal reduce death. mean, that’s whole purpose defeating virus? stop people dying? That’s vaccinated seniors first! ones likely die. Even vaccine invented stopped severe illness allowed transmission we’d popping shots, wants die? said anything ""blind faith?"" study results published, along decent amount third party analysis. sketchy biased sources. Yeah. Countries never bothered investing blaming spent billions taxpayer money research development 'vaccine nationalism'. That’s article linked says. article says that’s studied, data it. vaccine trials didn’t study whether prevented asymptomatic spreading. studied now. think saw Dr. CNN say effectiveness continue climb j&amp;j vaccination. 66% time collected data said may higher even longer vaccinated. make difference end result people getting vaccinated without fear reprisal job?  rise cases incredibly sharp. 12th feb, Mumbai around 3800 active cases, maharashtra around 30k. Today, numbers stand 60.8k 401k respectively. numbers today higher previous peak September October already, detected cases rinsing quick every single day. 

Kids, including toddlers, also alarmingly getting infected widely, though thankfully recoveries seem stellar. 


Things expected get dramatic worse get better. Wow. Ohh ok guess realize company pushing employees get vaccinated asap 100% financial interests 0 goodness hearts. think larger point lot institutions take granted corrupted years. Blind faith ""government agency approval"" good strategy used be. state Maharashtra, sure say headline best two comments thread. glad see reasonable views regarding human behavior necessary scientific data available become popular. governments worldwide invested much money vaccine production disinfecting surfaces policing open spaces we'd already end thepandemic. Friend, time move on. poor look Canada? course is, way many nations learned earlier never outsourced majority PPE production China. 

But let’s forget Canada’s covid deathrate per capita 1/3 UK’s 2.5x less USA’s. Canada done far better many many western nations look total response Covid.

Once USA mostly vaccinatted excess go first Mexico Canada (we already started this) open travel. Well you, presumably mistakenly, said COVID like virus could spread. isn't. Damn EU again! Ooof, ripped heart last night. Science miracle explanation! Montana, Idaho, Missouri too, thought International students. I'm 24 hours second dose Pfizer shoulder soreness far, crazy much things vary difference initial clinical studies one headline efficacy rates symptomatic COVID, test asymptomatic COVID. Ie., achieved 95% reduction symptomatic COVID, data many vaccinated infected yet asymptomatic (without data, overall rate could much lower, vaccine significantly reducing symptoms still leaving people infected). study, however, tested everyone, symptoms, confirmed reduction infections (both asymptomatic symptomatic) 90% two shots 80% one. 

The general conclusions study also proven Israel’s case count chart. Like git covid variations? real experimental general idea makes sense. Use radiation damages virus cells. Fucking classists...  Yea, pretending pharmaceutical companies government (particularly republican last 4 years) incapable something underhanded people's best interest oblivious. vaccine sure seems amazing pretty mild downsides, fault people hesitant vaccine new.  google 'Eric Ding charlatan' find experts explaining :) think Fauci public health experts basing recommendations feelings science? think know better do? people lie vaccinated avoid wearing mask? Fauci CDC others already saying vaccinated people meet together indoors without masks. asking for? losses nonverbal communication inability smile outweigh benefits public health keeping masks social norm time being. 9/11’s worth people died almost everyday year US virus, that’s strawman argument, inconvenience going airport little earlier wait line?

We’re fucked species lol Thanks?  Mass currently 6th states % 1st shot administered. We’re something right. Final check-in: 

Original prediction 50% / 25% April 1st.

[CDC us at: Even right, lots states holding reporting today theory yes now, people vaccinated could issue. said, zogo13 states, England Israel months now, despite majority population immunity really growing. even impressive UK many people vaccinated AstraZeneca (while Israel pretty much Pfizer). Definitely COVID disease caused virus, named SARS-CoV-2 arm sore 48 hours pfizer dose 1 throw fit wear shirt shoes restaurant? don’t see different. It’s basic social consideration others. fully expect wearing one work least another 6-8 months that’s long students able get vaccinated. It’s big deal. Staying home big deal. Going normal life one extra item clothing? big deal. asymptomatic dead 2 days though? Seems unlikely maybe. Eligibility actually getting shot always related. Lots places opening virtually everyone even get priority groups. waiting queue long. rough people, sore arm expect second shot. anecdotal evidence fiance, parents two friends sore arm shots. marketing folks Gillette must found new occupation. 

New Gillette... 5 ~~blades~~ mutations. Yes, many people know including Ohio. 

So everyone takes software development simplicity easy (thanks Apple), really make things simple, much work goes it.

So two components software here. first ability schedule. difficult varying criteria timing across states, scheduling criteria able schedule even though eligibility may open days. trying limit people showing aren’t eligible date appointment. 

The second one actually gets saved appointment details. info needs correct you’ll notice doesn’t actually specifically list eligibility here. check ask qualifying condition. 

So feel free answer questions however need to, able schedule date you’re eligible. Michigan's weird. rural areas super right-wing militia culture, cities pretty normal, MSU famous sports parties. Florida's case fucked income tax. businesses sales it. He's worried people come, plenty people stay away feel safe. Exactly, proof required we’ve reached herd immunity however long takes, question then? ask proof congregate: vaccine card passport. sore arm maybe bit fatigue night got shot (I also worked yard day could legit tired). Apart that, nothing. fair simply overweight counts medical condition, like 80% state eligible COVID

????????

""Zero COVID"" commendable always possible. Sometimes settle 50 COVID even 100 COVID. zero-sum process either everything completely closed cases, look places like Taiwan Iceland, example, whose COVID strategies really get looked enough deThe reality many people actually understand takes reach kinds low numbers answer island even strict lockdown, MASSIVE AMOUNTS GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. government, pocketbook hand, ready support every closed business, every quarantined employee, every COVID test, every sort mitigation found effective.

""Zero COVID"" never possible places like US simply government willing foot bill still aren't. school I’ve going to. It’s coming, fucking new it. Dumb ass system. Goa awesome!

While there, visit Kerala bit south well. Honestly admire mental gymnastics turn good news something bad. Stay home rest life want to. Us fully vaccinated ready move on. reminder people todays tomorrows numbers wonky due easter. Vaccine passports technically always thing. many countries prove you’ve yellow fever vaccine even get visa. may like world wide now, don’t see anything wrong it. Isn’t great see? traffic light watching cars leave mass vaccination site yesterday, smiling pointing car pulling out, saying, “You got vaccine! got vaccine! Yay! got one too! Congrats!” husband laughing happy made me. said wants park car adjacent shopping center happily watch site churn vaccinated people. Cornell, ever heard it? get shot now? Already responded someone else this, go. It’s scaring people 

For couple reasons 

For one lives Twitter tweets often nuggets information fail show whole picture. could picked number vitro studies live virus show neutralization B1.135 P.1 adequate, instead picked one outlier using pseudovirus. Stuff like makes seem disingenuous

He also lacks pedigree lot infectious disease experts epidemiologists have. People like Fauci, yes even Osterholm working field many, many years established reputations academic prowess. Feigl-Ding doesn’t, expertise actually nutrition. 

He’s disingenuous. Like said bit tries make B.C. P.1 outbreak seem huge simply misleading never states high level genomic surveillance Canada doing. Another perfect example graph tweet used alarm P.1. Yes variant problem, doesn’t take time explain factors play Brazil, like one worst pandemic responses world national level 

Basically he’s guy proved right early warnings coronavirus, he’s parlayed career armchair Twitter analyst things covid. He’s good source follow aren’t much getting information getting Eric Feigl-Ding’s spin information Per-capita best measure march towards head-immunity low case numbers, absolute numbers best measure ""impressive"" vaccine rollout is. 

Frankly shameful Germany highest GDP EU, best infrastructure EU, world-leading healthcare system... essentially delivering trickle vaccines. 

Meanwhile India absolutely MASSIVE landmass population much challenging logistical situation getting many shots arms. 

As ex-German, feel like Germany zero excuse outstripping India order magnitude. Withdrawl NATO? true friend opinion Russia? Sure, one ever backstabbed them.

We even need go decade see happens counties NATO, like Ukraine. majority population going get vaccine. going continue need vaccine passports years people dumb get vaccinated? get fake passports none stop people anti-vax want do. time even think enough people vaccinated herd immunity covid big deal anymore say aids? big surge last spring mostly concentrated Detroit area, everywhere else less open season. hope got enough older people vaccinated death toll bad. moved fifth grade. due tetanus booster ended starting like week school got delay Agree don’t trust pharma say stats. trust scientist healthcare officials since much smarter definitely understand mRNA vaccines. 

I haven’t gotten vaccine yet I’m group 1C able make appointment week I’m pregnant - haven’t many studies pregnancy vaccine. still plan getting closer towards end pregnancy baby already cook chilling. Eat dick sub cancer well, CDU says internet really useful scan print fax send via email wherever there's intern copy-type scanned printout.

Fun Fact: cope enormous amount fax machines needed keep track people infected/in contact SARS-CoV-2-infected people regional government Mittelfranken (northern Bavaria I'm much) re-routed investment money ""computer systems"" ""more fax machines"", completely shutting communications due issues changing central telephone system four-digit-fax numbers five digits. Let's hope they've got horseback couriers ready... Something like 99.7% people get recover fine... vaccine. otherwise healthy adult underlying conditions get I'll fine. get die, say told so. 

If scared getting it, maybe YOURE one hiding rock? Crazy moving slower CA. Never thought that’d happen, dunno keep supply many restrictions. go suck bleach you’re People anti-vax people cautious.

There's long term studies COVID19 vaccines vaccines existed year.

So argument evidence support safe long term.

The argument understand mechanisms well enough long term studies needed prove safe there's way they'd cause problem shows years later. Ivies cheap middle class. rich pay full price afford it. poor go free. middle class try squeeze every penny family. nothing stopping wearing it. never work. 5-6 days week house wearing mask. I’m done. Finally clickbait headline part Reuters. know copied headline news site. chips arranging Get cancer Why? got Q's. I've got A's. “as is” headline publication. changes made everyone read article. click bait headline! Strewth... Ohhhh that’s interesting. Thanks explanation!! Didn’t realize stuff Don’t make assumptions. I’m teacher we’ve fully person since fall. Even remote required work campus. worn mask 40 hours week since August, double masked 40 hours week since December surge got bad. really bother me. right rights violated mandating vaccines? care vaccines mandatory not, people going suffer anti-vaxxers. long everyone wants vaccines gets one, harm people choosing get vaccinated.

It's like obesity, care people willingly obese killing themselves, mean would rather makes sad see suffer, also want forcefully put diet healthy weight.  couple reasons 

For one lives Twitter tweets often nuggets information fail show whole picture. could picked number vitro studies live virus show neutralization B1.135 P.1 adequate, instead picked one outlier using pseudovirus. Stuff like makes seem disingenuous

He also lacks pedigree lot infectious disease experts epidemiologists have. People like Fauci, yes even Osterholm working field many, many years established reputations academic prowess. Feigl-Ding’s expertise actually nutrition. 

He’s disingenuous. Like said bit tries make B.C. P.1 outbreak seem huge simply misleading never states high level genomic surveillance Canada doing. Another perfect example graph tweet used alarm P.1. Yes variant problem, doesn’t take time explain factors play Brazil, like one worst pandemic responses world national level 

Basically he’s guy proved right early warnings coronavirus, he’s parlayed career armchair Twitter analyst things covid Bold move Cornell. Half kids anyways know, people always fall back per-capita argument. agree per-capita useful measure determine progress towards herd immunity. 

That said, far vaccine rollout speeds, think raw number doses far important. Ultimately, getting millions doses huge country enormous population harder shows much ""achievement"" seen Germany. 

Frankly country like Germany world-leading infrastructure highest GDP EU waaay faster India. I'm sure people card issued physician exempting vaccination. 

I think kind hilarious choose grossly irresponsible put others risk 'discriminated' against. clearly understand civil society works. Please edit comment correct pfizer AZ got stay home? one essentials going work +5 days week. That’s house place wear mask majority time. 

Try getting perspective empathy people vaccinated might want stop wearing one forced one face hours year life off. thought Broccoli Rabe boner champ  current COIVD-19 vaccines safe immunocompromised individuals contain live virus. issue around immunocompromsied person may generate strong immune response even vaccines. 

It's also dangerous myth say vaccinated people can't end hospital. mRNA vaccines look 96-97% effective relative unvaccinated individuals hospitalization. JnJ likely substantially less effective (probably around 85%). fantastic numbers, course, plenty vaccinated individuals end hospitalized COVID end endemic spread disease herd immunity. Good India. much doomsday speaking India since pandemic begins, good know Indian people capable hold own. got funding distribution upgrades supply chain, mobilized FEMA military assist vaccinations, recruited retired healthcare workers assist shots. Securing doses little can’t distributed administered. Gotta say though- there’s nothing cautious student person learning avoiding covid vaccine. That’s trading one risk another. majority causes death preventable. think force good. sometimes bit passive aggressive social media, that's it. follow Fb given lot useful info. like Scott Gottlieb US: takes seriously fear monger realistic human behavior. Brazil's president also basically everything power help virus burn unchecked population. Neither measles flu global pandemics, Seems happening - Trump hid fact took January months. even source leak taking past presidents like Obama, Bush, Clinton publicly so.

Trump always says everything cover bases never strongly urged people take vaccines. measles flu vaccine passport? someone PhD completely incorrect. Something kills *in vivo* almost always works administered orally topically. I'm Pharmacologist. Purdue Pharma, CT Dr. Brandy Goldberg. look up. Even *without* vaccines, we’d eventually go back normal, like every pandemic throughout history depends state. many states ""tons appointments"" restrictions make sense. Taking vacation abroad 

You may false impression China developed USA/Germany. reality, people China never taken vacation abroad , feel need cost several months salary. security theatre liability viruses similar survival rates 99%. reason death rates way higher combination much vaccinations, testing, countries weird criteria deciding covid death. vaccination rates reach similar numbers flu, reason assume way people die covid. Ope, ya got us. republican enforcing freedom regulating practices private business. seem remember right arms cake maker years ago......Oh wait stand freedom aligns views.... doubt partisans equal restrictions valid points.
I socially clueless understand. wait almost 4 months this? thats amazing. dad would tell much shes helped hometown. never doubted never checked it. glad see seems like true! 

shes one good ones didn’t know vaccination going well Canada. That’s good news. no? soon get second dose, mask comes off. social distancing months anyway. 
I'm aware even end pandemic, still people hiding inside bunkers, social distancing world cursing people want get old lives back. 
You're probably going one them.
But know what? People die every day. folks keep dying, even thing turns endemic. 

So do? force everyone lockdown indefinitely? prevent 90% population living, 100 people still dying covid? Sorry, that's going happen.
Why social distance world leave us want lives back alone? ted cruz right once, except timing always find interesting many self-hating people Indiana never lived anywhere else imagine everywhere else magical paradise.

And going politicians' home, ""home dipshit Pence"" still better home dipshit Trump. go dawgs susceptible it, want careful, not, something stop getting (people using excuse). answer specifically referencing one ways China controls freedom live want professional opportunities. appreciate finding sources. PACS describe feel could people reporting regular health problems before/concurrently COVID. would interested see longer term, controlled, studies future.

But provided sources part. appreciate insight. 3,999,999ers! Total BULLSHIT! April deliveries line March; they’re ramping shit!  man got job place Ozarks literally throw rolls you... go get booster shot show vax records!!


i assumed normal.
and schools too.

before knew antivaxx bullshit assumed everyone needed schools, days cares etc Brazil equator. gets way sun either places. Lmao absolutely terrible policy. vaccinated don’t need wear mask. Imagine damn plastic pollution potential cause. Policy really following science here. problem close damn beach mean, guess could spin way, except bacteria viruses literally foreign body body whole system designed say ""YOU BELONG HERE, GET FUCK OUT, KILL KILL KILL IT,"" women system designed nurture baby help grow time safely leave continue existence.

What I'm saying that, illness part nature, literally part bodies like wombs are. weather turning spring help control infections, Canada overall could 50% adults vaccinated end month. I’m optimist feel like Canada able get control quickly. flu vaccine passport? genuinely asking false equivalency here. Either refuse serve reason can't, Period. Thanks, needed reminder. That’s clinical trial data says. Eventually real world data mean time clinical trial data best info have. literally zero reason even imagine unknown adverse effects years road. would one thing literally 18th century smallpox inoculation pustules. difference COVID vaccines commonly given vaccine method generating spike protein. immune response likely different, there's theoretical explanation even COULD cause effects road. freedom important someone else's life? seems like a...SMART thing disaster? made dosing error one trial actually turned fortunate thing found beneficial. press spun negative thing could positive. lot scientific discoveries made way. 

The story published 'out date' data agreement February date initial data check point finished analysing recent results yet. exactly massive difference. flu far less transmittable kills far fewer people covid. 

If enough people take vaccine covid death rates fall flu like numbers social distancing place, vaccine passport unnecessary. surety. people going die anyway. Either slowness vaccine rollout simply immune systems able handle covid. 
If keep everything closed last person us vaccinated, likely waiting 2025. 2030 lol. know lots people refusing vaccine, right? give life, save 900 people connection impact on. cause deaths. 
Sometimes, stroke bad luck. blame families spreading weakest link bad sore throat weekend allergies. allergies season many places spring could common cause. Yep! Best vaccine one get first hyperbole numbers? know program work should. However, personally know 10 ppl vaccinated (including myself).
 enough bad news, need make even worse know back 2019 much money anti-scientific content making creators technology companies distributed it. also become quite clear governments little ability control it. 

It's hard find people really want take task. see many vaccines, Peter Hotez US, personal reason so. imagine number people might want take quite small, combative disposition maybe makes person much willing so.  I'm familiar sort statement certainly looks like someone comfortable throwing punches social can't convince really hardcore anti-vaxxer, ridicule them. show people stupid ignorant fake statements are. Frankly people wear mask wish could order stop talking Norway. Vaccination centers vaccinating 1-3 days week. Absolutely need open weekends. 

The small vaccination center town father lives capacity 5000 day get 3000 doses week. double April, better days coming. going quit smoking drinking 2020. Guess happen. Well side effects expected. first dose Covid before? far doubting vaccines—don’t that. extremely safe gone thru rigorous trials (they development long Covid). 

All side effects went away day half. Stay hydrated pop Tylenol. Personally I’d rather 2 shitty days ever get Covid. Plus vaccinations able go normal again. still calling pregnancy disease, false equivalency. There's also massive difference mother dying childbirth child past age reason bringing virus home kills parents. Everyone wants talk psychological impacts lockdowns children, becomes abundantly clear soon go past surface conversation actual concern people **their** mental health. fact implying school age children losing parents psychologically damaging mother dying childbirth illustrative.

No one suggesting stay locked forever. Sure, people feel way, talking one them. I'm suggesting maybe give parents chance get vaccine get crazy it. vaccine available, would probably feel like need open back up, since multiple amazing vaccines, think tough little bit longer everyone shot available them. even everyone shot, available everyone.

There's room nuance conversation. Got it. It’s hard tell sometimes. Live SF it’s crazy many people ok living life full restrictions indefinitely. Even vaccine, tons people promote wearing masks indefinitely practicing social distancing. someone wants Individual level preaching hysteria dangerous. 

CA middle pack covid cases wise much better Florida far older obese population. everything wide open since summer including indoor concerts, nightclubs, bars, restaurants, Super Bowls, sporting events... Covid flu it’s bubonic plague either. get vaccinated need move on... Love doctor / researcher sketch’s short sleeved lab coat. Lol anyone who's going Cornell. seem thinking part huge group people massive inconveniences masks.

You're not. might medical condition makes overly sweaty, probably dehydrated constantly, keep chalking masks somehow wrong ineffective. fact think ""a better fitting mask"" make condensation issues worse speaks fact aware ""better fitting mask"" save lives. greatest mask world, fitted properly it'll worse normal store bought mask well fitted.

The fact wetting mask walking probably indicator really consult doctor. understand probably frustrating live like that, mask. overweight people, sweaty people, world, altitudes, indoors outdoors, wear masks without problem.


It's mask situation, situation consult medical professional. describing sound healthy. Might sugar related well; people sweat uncontrollably sugar unchecked. bit early talk this. Bring everyone chance get shot. wanna scared!!! Stay fuck home everybody like others reported windshield glass laminated PVB, blocks like 99% UV light. side rear windows tempered glass, lets UV light through. Absolutely. UK opening schools barely impact case rate thousands children illiterate going high school. certainly don't. again. Red blue, lot people sick crap. hit 200m, see things vastly improve. need give time India seeing big second wave Indian summer starting (it's 40C already)

I wonder reason colder countries flu winter...people stay indoors close. people stay indoors die heat air conditioned rooms ventilation like times. one medical condition includes overweight (BMI 25+). That's 60% Massachusetts right there, one skinnier US states. bump cigarette sales

I'm sure fact they're best dismantle vaping industry nothing it. making unreasonable request, feel like simply courtesy rub in. Yes understand technically adds little risk, extremely rude. Pfizer Moderna best Second ain’t bad  Kinda remember saying swamp, lets know worth wasting anymore time on. swamps populated like cities. good reasons. means there's less people areas, means little spread. UK almost entirely B117 (Kent) Variant, yet children back school barely made difference care rates despite huge increases testing children parents. infections fallen despite return millions pupils classroom, raising hopes smooth easing restrictions.

Confirmed cases discovered routine testing appeared plateaued since return pupils school March 8, although rise cases school-age children partly picked mass testing programmes.

Professor Paul Hunter, epidemiologist University East Anglia, said: “It’s looking really good. really important thing schools going make big difference obvious now. haven’t. weird me. people want never end keep going distancing activities. Sorry friends everyone hermit going back normal thanks vaccines next time encounter anti-vaxxer, ask them: *Why would Dolly Parton lie you?* Well, alright. guess thats fair point. End argument? red indicates states people annoying accents. Oh shut up. People die choking food eating. use example, genius? Ban would lockdown past 400 years got vaccine. 

And EVERYONE took vaccine. Unlike idiots nowadays. look too! [Here might bad kinda want watch it. Hi everyone. wondering general consensus vaccine inoculate/protect better (between pfizer, moderna, JJ). initial research, sound like JJ less efficient two, protects COVID variants better protects serious symptoms better. could wrong. would helpful anyone anymore insight. Thanks! hope realize ridiculous sounds. Talking expels droplets air, contain viral load. could make new law says nobody talk, people claim violates rights say ""heh, spreading deadly disease right"". getting tested morning. I'll let know “One natural part human biology”

Um, I’m pretty sure illnesses normal part human biology millions years,  What’s latest information covid variants infection rates? already covid what’s chance get infected Manaos variant? easily get way would argue US water situation pretty third world. think argue handful aspects third world. wording used kind of, meaning many things close described third world. Honestly think controversial thing say. places definitely herd immunity already Without looking data, it’s incredibly likely it’s biased (unintentionally) asymptomatic spread. Children likely asymptomatic regardless variant, proven time time again. original strain could many cases went undetected. schools go person, cases arise children, percentage symptomatic asymptomatic may changed changed little, overall number may gone up. could easily confused dangerous/more contagious variant. 

Likewise, 50-60% increase severity isn’t bad children, considering original strain(s) roughly bad less bad flu kids. good think 14 days second shot. Research says moderna well protective variants almost certainly going get bad case Covid. might even infect you. I’m going I’m immunized ready get back normal case, personal responsibility? would school care 20, 30, 40 years now? hope see irony. You’re dramatic again. Quit dramatic.

Oh please. Every time hear someone accuse another dramatic, alarm bells go someone else gaslight. Sorry dude. feelings subject valid others. write doesn’t mean aren’t appropriate situation. think we’re gonna everything full force there’s vaccine kids, ease things adults telling parents protect children? know bunch people. tell get still wear mask? point social distancing proof doesn’t work. Pretty much, shoehorn ""immigration"", ""mainstream media"" ""liberals"", i'm gonna knock couple points. Yeah specially first doses projections u/Wizmaxman Probably first time I’ll excited word “impotent.” daughter 13 stellar student question ability socialize incredibly negativity impacted remote learning. basically one friend, that's makes point saying ""I one friend"" talk stuff, remote learning that's basically peer talks know of. person learning lot ""acquaintances"" lack better word. Peers interacted constantly school navigate personalities, apply conflict resolution with, etc. 

I'm saying done remote going HS next year pretty concerned ability make new friends socialize done year. Moderna shot #1. Mine little warm eased quickly. ramp-ups foreseeable future peaked?  Fine me. business whatever see fit. Lol. God, used smoke cigars like cigarettes. Inhale whole damned thing. Thank god vaping...  good points indeed. CT similar age based tiered approach. 45+ opened us 3 weeks ago 16+ last week, I've (30) already got first does. moving quickly here. data matters proven data vaccine effective. suggest vaccinated folks somehow become avenue spread proven government tries impose restrictions.

The vaccine get back normal shot, we’ve got six months data original trials find evidence spread post vaccine thing. don’t evidence never will. wasting everyone’s time suggest need rigor time.

Bad science. don’t take public health measures fear. knew vaccine effective reason believe vaccinated people would meaningful contributors spread.

One final point: said vaccinated people start travel they’re waiting mythical study prove safe? worst thing making rules go along. Get hair done. wear masks fine. sorts things found ways stay open safely thankfully. reopened patio dining, restaurants hired staff ordered food meet demand. 

Two weeks later closed patio dining businesses, barely keeping together, hung stock able sell staff let go again.

It infuriating many reasons. half assed measures made average citizen fed sacrifices. countries tackled right start hope keeping Covid bay.

It super sad - needn’t turned way flat wrong. Yeah, don’t mean generally vaccine. mean bigger picture. 

For example Pfizer first EUA people within FDA saying foregone conclusion would approved. literally waiting go motions incentive to, people (hypothetically) died. 

Not saying conspiracy anything. I’m saying health regulators evaluated many bad drugs filter out, many lives save. think healthy conversation around makes sense. rise cases within US largely due UK variant. It’s good thing spread country isn’t due vaccine resistant variant. 

I can’t speak rise cases globally don’t think article either. Easter Weekend. Lots people holiday. *overly* surprised people went weekend. Serious question: point posting misinformation? Covid far deadlier flu lingering consequences many survive. simple google search web pages end .gov .org show many people typically die flu vs many far died covid. that's social distancing, sanitizing, mask wearing shut downs. 





Misinformation calling facts misinformation, irony, fun fact: majority people get covid survive without lingering side effects,


 fun fact, flu practically non existent last year apparently causing charade go longer have,
fun fact: survival rate 99% Percent, 
Fun fact: PCR test proven ineffective diagnosing covid
Fun fact: states screwed covid count counting murder victims tested positive covid 30 days Covid fatality.
Fun Fact: herd immunity met faster due natural immunity, along vaccine, 
Fun fact: 70% people hosptalized due covid obese (per CDC)
FunFact: areas highest vaccination rates drastic increase covid cases, keep playing game, 
Covid killer, Fear comparable. 

Dead parents always dead. 

Schooling made summers, another year end. Emotional development worked therapy. government even pay things. Live fear forever sweetie. hope wear helmet walk outside. It’s worth arguing point view requires math real numbers. It’s feel sake, society’s sake, hope so. virus, serious is, isn’t worth long term damage caused faulty distance learning. Things kept getting worse worse really recently help Wasting time.

The actual “risk vector” doesn’t matter. point is, risk dying Canadian roads higher risk dying covid aged 0-34 - doesn’t matter one contagious disease not. track former current attempts get anything back “normal” pandemic, answer likely “probably not.” Something shitty emerged derail progress every single instance. Best plan instead wishin hopin things magically work out. Right. reaction, many hours after. Floridian here. Governor Ron DeSantis politicized pandemic, rushed reopening July wave hit last year, palled around radiologist promoted herd immunity, prevented counties implementing stricter measures slow spread, may taken political contributions exchange vaccinating certain rich communities, plus whole bunch stuff.

Cases rising. like Israel started vaccination campaign, steep drop off.

It's okay people give point live lives. Covid never going away entirely. Soon people want choose get vaccine wide availability. point, longer matters. vaccine safe. There's exactly 0 evidence  hope lining buy doses parents grandparents. I'm sure there's lot distrust illegal immigrants ""coming out"" get vaccine. Also, communication language must another hurdle beat. I'm glad helped. vaccinate large percentage adult population really need worry kids? I'm kind disturbed people completely put life pause one told that, especially comes health. P1 ravaging west coast hitting alberta hard, matter weeks everywhere else. Still bunch easters away normal online first grader, way better online thought would. also full time job help her. everyone this. that, Reddit demographic (mostly younger, mostly whiter, urban, higher income average) demographic least qualified argue anything need in-person learning. 100% uptime gigabit fiber home, kids enough money buy computer hardware, assume everybody else must too. spreading preventable diseases private decision? becomes quite public start coughing covid classmates. Russians say good submitted data effect *The Lancet*.

Skeptically, Russia making serious effort use domestically, official Russian COVID numbers blatant fakes, prior Russian miracle drug claim follow drug trial norms appears fake, vaccine trial conducted exclusively Moscow region. Nice. Finally got first shot Friday. Go back end April 2nd. folks fully vaccinated, wife. Lol. Literally stop it. 

No one needs continue socially distance vaccinated. no, looking likely cannot still spread disease vaccinated. So, again, stop it. new pandemic. rules game changed. exploding quebec vulnerable person go back N95. Thank you, sorry hear exactly applies Germany. disagree, show epidemiological controlled study evidence suggests vaccinated people common pathways spread disease. It’s thing CDC suggest emergency measures need stay place prove it’s thing instance foolish.

The vaccine works proven. Maintained restrictions vaccinated people based science fear uncertainty. said wasnt. said dont care. also ive heard past 5 months “just weeks.” getting old. Yes believe case. I'll try find source I'm quite sure why, AZ contracting way doses able produce. vaccines manufacturers small hiccups right schedule now. AZ still delivering 50% less EU, initially agreed on. whatever is, played heads, factor something crucial distribution simply bad luck. still them. Jump infront traffic, overdose fentanyl, tell woman slowly love love them... fauci fatigue? still get scheduled vaccine Tuesday might sick covid?

Found exposure.. Looking rapid test appt..

Starting feel sick also highest number cases school kids Germany, even though politicians trying deny danger months. go, 3rd wave gathering steam now. Regardless School ain’t replacement parenting. Kids causing new wave infections. fair, ever since got vaccination certificate ""green passport"", asked present even once.

To fair, mother told goes favorite cafe always ask show it, least buisnesses actually enforce it, remember ever open PDFs phone ever since downloaded them.

It's really hollow threat right now, wonder people go take shots actually enforced strictly... quit smoking drinking finally. Hope keep go back working pubs 😬 Reddit listens CDC they’re saying something agree eith Iv fully vaccinated since December one first 250k people still feel right going things. want set bad example  appears work like antibodies, monolithic. probably similar effect antibody treatments use (monoclonal plasma), means acts antiviral work well given shortly infection nobody gets treatment. 

Vaccines course best solution sufficiently scalable treatments could help also. That's use cloth mask wash reuse. accessible to? proof non-existent pudding. Perhaps though.  Medical professionals exposed covid way someone going grocery store nobody's wearing masks exposed covid.

Medical professionals Estimates late April May, case counts low enough may even need masks vaccinated not.

This seem case cases rising nationwide.

And that's need correct misconception. relax mask mandates say oh over. type actions sabotaging response. NEET years. wanna find school study get friends real life. Please tell it'll soon. shit dumbass.  trespassing compliant temperature taking. mean? someone explain? 50 million, that's like 1/3 opening weekend 2019 Previous Godzilla movie. lmao FTFY*

FTFY Nah... I'm high risk couple categories. Groceries delivered - worth give little sunbath. you, obvi... 

It's difficult tease apart fomite person person transmission enough published peer-reviewed paper: 

""This doesn’t mean surface transmission never occurs. points out, difficult disentangle relative contributions inhaled droplets contaminated surfaces, people come contact potentially infectious surfaces generally also close contact infected late? incorrect. Kids die. also ignoring long term effects still evaluated cardiovascular system. potentially lifelong complications segment people, children included, got covid lived. 

As child deaths, even though hundreds foe US millions, still shitty act like children getting covid big far kids wearing masks, *shrug* Darwin's theory. I've seen plenty 3 year olds wearing masks keeping on. Parents train toddler wear mask correctly even adults still covering nose chin diapering...it comes large section population bright jerks believe protecting community part. go stuff. late reported Argentinian president got 2 doses Sputnik. I've working home year now... really stressor I've seen co-workers tbh, guess that's benefit introvert pandemic. want take “pyschological abuse” level sure. think invalidating someone’s feelings emotions indeed form trivialization fundamental gaslighting. Telling someone dramatic easy way dismiss someone’s opinions time make feel conflicted arguments, simply emotions tied them. It’s manipulative taste it.

Their morality tells need wear mask personally feel responsible infecting others. Mine moral ideology done best protecting others reached point quality life suffering, ok returning normalcy without experiencing mental anguish. 

I agree restrictions place vaccines available want it. don’t think masking actually accomplishing anything vaccinated theater point. 

The contradict context yes. wasn’t concise been. vaccinations available state (less two weeks) done wearing switching life back normal. (Hosting BBQ, eating indoors, going bars, parties).

My main argument OP seemed think arbitrary effort wear masks. pointing majority life spent wearing mask since pandemic started empathize essential detest standard living. Well it’s mostly dipshits like continue spew misinformation change mind things every single day hell people desperate remote/hybrid stay obviously hurting productivity learning making people miserable? Sure, however, people seem mistaken impression get vaccinated can't get covid.

This case. That's I'm saying. I’m dentist would encourage get teeth cleaned! Every dental office I’ve seen taking lots extra precautions transmission within dental offices extremely low. I’ve back work almost year gotten teeth cleaned well I’ve seen safe we’re being. real Dr. Fauci fatigue. generally, side effects Pfizer vaccine take hours kick in, right?

I ask Indiana explicitly opened doors Illinois residents get shot, want make sure crazy expect spend hour/90 minutes driving home afterwards. Breakthrough cases always expected. That's 95% effective means. Mumps vaccine 80% effective. many people know mumps? people natural infection vaccines matter. Estimates late April May, case counts low enough may even need masks vaccinated not.

One awesome thing study one exposed covid medical professionals California time. Infection levels would lot lower profession. That's perfect population study. loser shut-ins terrified losing moral superiority advocating it. FYI: read article Cardona said really sure yet expect situation fluid - good politician answer - Post kinda sensationalized it. putting anyway. Except spikes deadly. Death rates plummeting. We've vaccinated at-risk. 4 million people vaccinated everyday. much sub defines life around covid end world, ending, people want go back normal. Also site projected we've surpassed natural immunity vaccines yesterday repeated lot, may true couple months ago. real world date data Pfizer. One shot 90% efficacy variants. One shot Pfizer higher efficacy j&amp;j today’s environment. agree, someone works setting eye opening see that. agree people disingenuous suddenly caring poor kids sudden. 

However, gap remote learning EXTREME it’s highlighted, especially since schools tend open rich areas closed poor ones. 

My students trying learn zoom they’re caring younger siblings, unsupervised playing video games, coping loss family members. 

These kids don’t desk kitchen parents work home supervise them. home alone caring others parents working essential jobs Canadian. confirm. Things somehow feel even lower ever. vaccination program nightmare, leaders failed us, things getting control. We’re looking US... mean I’m happy vaccination program think we’re envious. friends US younger vaccinated vaccinated, they’ve recently started vaccinating people 60. 85 year old grandmother got first dose week half ago, second one isn’t till June! Meanwhile variants control hospitals filling worse ever. I’m sick it. First world problems. coronavirus get tired. generation asked wear cloth mask stand 6 feet away someone country and

Well, no, ""this generation"". Everyone. Including previous generations. Also, look goes protests masks social distancing. middle aged old people. Young people go *those* protests. go things ""difficulties"" great bear some.

You act generation fought generation supports news sources politicians call ""fake news virus"". I'm senior semester, would last year. can't afford move yet I'm accounting major semesters like 18 credits make enough CPA exam.

She said care drop out. brother started instigating awhile back, anti vaxx general really stuck one reason. 100% right right. opinion, business, country, etc making mandatory vaccine undermines autonomy won’t get support. good Russian vaccine? No, mean adults. April 1, 19 states opened eligibility everyone. Less half. Even want wait 50 states, would say around 35 40 states open eligibility would good enough, especially 35 40 include densely populated states. tattoo number arm? Uh, no, important part. Team medical staff go homes give IVs. really sick. Also, insiders confirmed Brazilian variant.

Lastly, Travis Harmonic initially refused return play summer. daughter respiratory issues. He's one players list, unfortunately. reports family members getting sick, lot hockey fans nervous situation. Try late spring. There’s already 100 million least one dose. 

The rolling 7 day average around 1,8 million first doses day. keep pace (which likely even increase) that’d get US 150+ million first doses end April, probably hitting half population beginning May. What's point? Yes, possible, vaccines 100% effective. unlikely. 

What likelihood? lot states checking IDs. they're able, road trip one states. I'm familiar west coast sure start east. know works CA NV. money there*
Fify  NYT predicts 70% June 14th guess however is, we'll eventually slow pace approach vaccinating everyone wants it, we'll % adult population never gets it, we'll never reach 70%.

I think unless vaccines approved 16, we'll get like 60ish percent stall out. Pointless. can't subject people enough UV light make difference virus without seriously fucking somebody It’s absolutely crazy, go back type lockdown don’t work unless it’s 100% lockdown. It’s hurting peoples business making us depressed Yeah, understand missing it. family members don't, they're extroverted be. guess depends person. Flu endemic saying normalcy resume least consistently wrong, dispute it. LoL test illegal immigrants. true highschool. students say much harder pay attention self discipline remote class. oh ok sorry Thank you! .... FluMist? Like every year. Problem there's ton issues vaccine past decade, overly attenuated viruses can't replicate enough create immune response severe production hiccups. don’t want wear mask rest life. it’s extremely unreasonable ppl sacrificed much already. sound like understands possibility worst case scenarios virological outbreaks, story about, sounds like perfect speaker, agree guaranteed happen. seems like warning potentially could. I'd go next ""Contagion!"" type movie. hope theorizes happen though. Um... vaccinate weekends Sweden, holidays. Easter, Stockholm thousands available appointments aged 75+ four mass-vaccination centers. Vårdcentraler vaccinate rate get vaccines, sometimes weekends, sometimes don’t. Depends provider. end-game then? 100% Vaccinated end goal posts, guess not? r/LosAngeles post getting shots Bakersfield day. chart showing deaths normal year debunks theory pretty much immediately. Jesus Christ. 

I’m even going engage point. data there. CDC said travel, gather unvaccinated folks, etc. They’re proclaiming loudly they’re focused vaccinations moment.

You though. don’t try tell vaccinated do. OK. noun

  unity agreement feeling action

Eh yeah literally dude got 2nd Pfizer last Wednesday! slight stuffy nose feeling went sleep, woke feeling extremely fatigued body aches. Took day work, popped Tylenol, napped. Felt better normal Friday :) Mostly former generation. Ok US 1 Covid death day say good situation? Calling anything “good situation” always relative. mean perfect ideal. means better promising. Hi everyone, keep seeing videos masks black worms even claiming nanorobots. science person, believe stuff still, wonder things are. Anybody got idea? hair, manufacturing material, something else? seeing videos like world. pretty International travel vaccination status check business usual, big deal. 

Having checkpoints inside country movement walled haven’t taken (or haven’t offered...) “optional” vaccine big deal. 

I know vaccines work, full range kid even took swine flu one, domestic covid passport idea breaking usually handle vaccination program. upvoting mask babies? Holy shit. i'm break. i've fucking lockdown bullshit entire fucking year. last week first time i've done anything sit around singularly travel houses feel even broken.

doesn't fucking help vaccine system seems like run Ticketmaster nobody damn clue general availability thing. can't keep this. 500 thousand Americans dead. Let's feel sorry forget completely. say ""everyone vaccine,"" said ""available everyone."" There's pretty big difference there. makes sense give shots who're back breaking work putting food tables. Food pick itself. Central Valley (Red region) many unused doses mass vax site Cal State Bakersfield opened slots adult California, regardless age. Solidarity isn’t ‘I’m suffering must suffer too’. know risks covid death young people incredibly low. real time studies vaccine. 

We need vaccinate elderly test long terms effects since average, they'll probably live 20 30 years (and since higher risk death). 

Once established (like vaccines) become mandatory. April 29th, precisely, day I’m done restrictions. That’s exactly two weeks second shot. can’t wait life again. mean way reddit want it? Unfortunately think right way.

Its trying find balance allow kids go back school get education seeing friends whilst limiting spread best possible isn’t said. yeah im aware. full transparency - dont care anymore. Devils fan checking in. actually playing well covid fell cliff Fewer people symptoms means fewer tests. Hopefully latter Sooner  dont care subject useless measures.  
Ive infected 5 months ago still antibodies. argument safe vaccinated people go able so: sure hell same.  

Ifollowed restrictions imho important set example. politicians dont think thats important: it, Ill quite happy it. everyone mean including children? vaccines already available adults many states. think correct, also think ""things"" opening bit now, Parents(and grandparents) let protections control extending enforcing children go bit lax. prevent deaths elderly, pretty good job right now, concerned kids eventually ones unprotected, may long term effects Covid yet aware kids. thing US media since late 1800s

That said, yeah like Reuters editorializes days rather simple news wire service loved. Still beats hell CNN though. interesting tweet member White House's COVID team:

*Striking data Michigan, age groups higher vaccination rates lower increases COVID-19 case rates. Also highlights importance staying vigilant work increase vaccine-induced immunity population. aren’t attached chart shows COVID case rates Michigan surging 20-59 age group increasing 60-69 age group. increase almost nonexistent 70-79 age group 80+ age group. Hear man out, point thought, dumb loaded may seem. 
If something holds edge sanity logic. ever happened anyway? think societal changes permanent, cannot adapt changes well future. Virtual/hybrid learning remote work stay. Students can't handle able handle post-pandemic world either.

Something similar happened WWI. Women entered workforce permanently. least performing male workers suffered socially emotionally due replaced qualified women war, boys school worry competing girls jobs finish school. Nevertheless, society going back way things war.

It get easier. probably rather difficult teenage boy used women working accept women part workforce now. However, kindergarten boy always knew women worked, change difficult all. Likewise, children exposed virtual/hybrid learning young age naturally ok academically, socially, emotionally, naturally ready remote/hybrid work become adults. Younger kids great following rules routines rat someone wash properly lol. great. EU banned export vaccine components, US/UK would retaliate banning export vaccine components. would grind EU vaccine manufacturing halt EU would rightly capitulate immediately. US/UK self-sufficient vaccine production, EU's barely spinning up. going stop?

Never. SARS-COV-2 endemic. never go away. Reporters getting progressively dumber every year. rate, seeing half population least one dose AZ makes large part Covax. countries involved cannot afford buy vaccines, certainly entire population. It’s logistics what’s available. International travel, sure. everyday stuff? No. Problem Michigan Minnesota still red numbers mean nothing arent clear here! got first shot last week. Certainly. Easter. I'm getting together family. Everybody minus 3 year old vaccinated. I'm worried. gonna start eating restaurants again? No. I'm gonna still take forceable future. optimistic make prudent risk assessment decisions short term. mention mRNA technique used YEARS TREAT CANCER. Effectively. hurt cancer patient, already weak, chances hurts 'normal' person? decades scientific development coming head. able make future vaccines novel viruses increasing speed efficacy. People like feel good seriously take COVID, choice basically forced wear mask etc. easy handle middle class people.

There plethora causes death far exceed COVID deaths never taken seriously this, basically whole world trying tackle it. 

I honestly gave caring this. wear mask everywhere, limit amount people see, part. can't take seriously anymore. Germany everything closed since forever. hey, hairdressers stay open, right? Nail salons? Muy importante! Busses packed brim? Yep. need negative test today want shop store, even alone. Next thing they’ll make vaccines mandatory go school! government make passports name, info, photo attached! truly 1984, etc etc! Yawn. people changed behavior never will. buckle vaccinate clearly don’t kids. Online awful, especially younger children terms learning. says nothing social impact isolated children.
They haven’t even submitted EUA single vaccine 12+, let alone younger kids. hope 12+ available time fall, seems like long shot younger kids vaccinated then. Obviously need inject bleach kill covid. smart, super genius US president suggested it. MyChart worst software I’ve ever used. know nothing him, would love sub sourced information linked.

Grab beer! would ironic longtime side effects popping future rendering half humanity narcoleptic shit... It’s reported MyIR states use it. commented morning. Seems like overwhelmingly good news one brutal years Americans recent memory.  AstraZeneca dropped PR ball came blood clotting issues. convince regulators vaccine would severe side effect. production implementation drug EU behind. mixed messing US issue production J&amp;J vaccine US, suffered another hit. Yeah Emergent BioSolutions fault, still AstraZeneca taken massive PR hit. That's felt last fall. 

But real talk. make graph kids academic growth across typical grade overlay year's, guess even half. can't handle nearly rigor. 

And same. take kid's year overlay online kids. We're talking half again. Even brightest remote kids killing August can't handle lower performing person kids point. They've went true AIG filler best. 

So also matter they're getting fucking stupid. wife teachers grateful kid still daycare. He, hopefully, suffer year. 

So ya. Last fall? I'm fucking babysitter. seeing effects? kids NEED real school.  I'm totally bodily autonomy think less somebody wanting take vaccine, right.

However, countries companies also much right deny entry see risk. shit. March-September 2020 actually quite refreshing. lost weight, got lots studying towards professional exams done, felt generally optimistic.

Covid become manageable vaccine fully especially amount people expected take it. comparable flu flu vaccine. side effects? Thanks, hopefully dissipate gotta distract im writing essay dude Reddit QUIT HARRASSING would line fairly well fact that, least Israel, vaccination rates reached 50%, cases plummeted.

OTOH, prevalence things like MOOCs colleges nearly arbitrary number paying students minimal overhead terms things like facility usage seat capacity. traditional learning come back, think asynchronous learning way either. repeating homie

That's know talking repeat myself.

If order 50 vaccines company delivers 50 vaccines, can't take people's vaccines 6 months later actually wanted 100 vaccines. 

Those vaccines ordered countries, can't ""repurpose"" them.

The US ordered 200 million doses signed agreement saying get first US factories. 

That's ""export ban"", that's contract prioritization. one stopping Pfizer Moderna producing doses US plants, finalizing deliveries US government, shipping overseas. They're choosing reasons known them. Probably not? need resident work states get it. state state thing. Also keep mind, even get vaccinated soon get immunity. People want admit we're willing take freedom higher death rate. least US admitted it. This. booked nice dinner exactly 2 weeks second. I’m taking horse riding lessons (had one scheduled week went lockdown) getting hair dyed. knew immunity date, planning fun self care stuff really helped get through. mean come across completely indignant skeptical, implying last year cooped house 24/7? I've regularly going get haircuts, dental appointments, regular health checkups, in-person dining, hanging friends around town, etc. wear mask distance necessary, otherwise life changed little. I've never gotten virus, none friends gotten virus, none family gotten either. seems unthinkable others brought life complete standstill last year. seen friends once? hair appointment gone shopping once? find extremely hard believe find extremely unhealthy debilitating someone's mental health indeed stay cooped like suggesting. heard Anton Khudobin currently COVID protocol. Businesses right discriminate ask people's private medical information. kids go this, eh? Brit, nice see EU flinging US time. really can't seem get heads around idea vaccines another country paid belong country paid them, even made factory EU soil. mean US/UK share vaccines US/UK paid made UK/US soil exchange. test see 5g Hotspot 🙃 (sarcasm) looking forward getting groceries (like curbside only) again.

You could manners... give one? No, effectiveness relative unvaccinated populations hospitalization. See posts sources. Effectiveness symptomatic infection estimated 94-95% Pfizer/Moderna 74% (66% including global data) JnJ. experts article means Osterholm, insane lockdown zealot Constant vigilance test much society values conscientiousness, patience, diligence. 

Basically every country outside East Asia parts Oceania failing. well said. [we even got cool shirt dont know hard understand. Depending variant vaccine 9 almost 40% chance one still catch it, transmit it. 

Dude, part get vaccine. goverment interest microchipping whatever afraid of. 

Honestly, afraid of? mild side effects 1st shot, got 2nd shot yesterday. felt sleepy/low energy arm hurt. it. Today, arm still hurts I’m otherwise back normal. Try worry it. appears vocabulary indicative overall intelligence understanding limits state government. purview regulate business state. Whether overstep authority certainly debate based posts far, everything everyone disagree “stupid” could really conjure another adjective? 

I would actually agree businesses allowed decide themselves, incentivize/coerce business corporate offering, withholding state support. absolutely make apply state agencies public schools universities. 

Also business going turn away business 2/3’s unvaccinated Americans country vaccine necessarily prevent infection

With data now, true statement. Michigan’s surge came restrictions eased. Someone tell USC, please. older kids private school meeting since September. Less dozen cases far among 300 students school. youngest public school since February. three cases 400 since returning. CDC isn’t making up. American Pediatric Association among medical groups also endorsed person schooling. surge almost nationwide. No, that’s works. 

They getting doses ordered Pfizer Moderna. They’re missing doses two. 

They problems AZ doesn’t. Depends day read news haha Yes, can’t say it’s 100% it’s Virtual instruction works insanely small portion student population. Sure 5-10% extremely motivated well kids could it. going leave 90%+ fail.

We it, learned valid replacement person instruction. failure numbers roof countless numbers kids insanely far behind grade levels. happening large scale k-12 level. agree EU member states needs reform order competitive China US. hope happens, don’t think we’ll seriously entertain idea leaving NATO realistic European alternative exists.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* practically impossible JnJ vaccines 80% effective asymptomatic infection trials showed 74% effectiveness symptomatic infection US. 

Admittedly confidence interval US-only showed range 48-87% protection symptoms, aggregating across regions (even excluding SA) 95% confidence interval shrinks 80%. There's always tiny chance clinical study really bad luck, leaves tiny window JnJ even hit 80% effectiveness symptomatic infection, much less asymptomatic infection. guess right so. why? u r fully vaccinated safe diseased horde? better cut-off date Coronavirus like say 2022. say over, u ur chance get vaccinated u get u r own. realize clarify. Every single therapy virus “can’t mutate around” virus mutate around except vaccines vaccines lead evolutionary-like response immune system out-evolves virus. 2nd pfizer yesterday got hit 12 hours later side effects lasted another 12 hours. lame peace mind working Side-remark, English first language: thanks sticking 'efficacy'. prompted find difference 'efficiency' 'efficacy'!

For others like me: Vaccine passports negative Covid tests. I’m it, fact look around me. California require large events hope comes near too. HIV status discrimination real.

Many people don’t know HIV status (and that’s it’s likely spread!!!). test everyone sleep HIV? 

It’s analogous. unknowingly catch HIV. unknowingly spread HIV. disease, NEVER discriminated BAR ENTRY based medical information. That’s fucked Twitter pretty awful place, cool able hear directly people studies, guess are! Imagine judging someone username like absolute loser. Robin Williams. learning remote/hybrid work stay. Students can't handle able handle post-pandemic world either.

Holy shit. Hilly terrains...? vaccine distribution? I've always struggled discipline, never extent. Like always least able get study some. ANYTHING. works like link [The survey vaccinated group placebo group. two groups 0.05% (vaccine) rate 1.00% (placebo) rate getting covid. 

Think akin genetics. People one population (A) might strong tendency towards immunity might causing ailment another population (B) reduces overall impact society 1/20th society B. case, there's vaccine convert person illness potential society B suddenly hardiness person society A. 

Freaking love many people today's society building toward giving humanity sort power. Early awareness available us 100 years ago saved countless lives. vaccine coming effective early save countless more. best part efforts people living one place single set religion, nationality, race, creed, form zealotry. many power caused great harm, people working create vaccines performed one greatest human achievements we've yet. Username checks out. 

Broadly, though- things aren’t going back 2019. question longer “how go back,” rather “how go forward.” 

In time, (in agreement author) suspect pendulum swing back, folks think less less thousands deaths move back offices such, think amount things today remain. minimum, hope pushes folks take (and companies provide) sick days, well cultural shift wearing masks cold/flu season. mention, bringing back, even month two, allow us identify who've suffered need help.

Right kids totally reach. kids come back noticeably different (e.g., significant weight gain loss, significant personality change, large academic deficits, large social deficits), tag kids try get back track summer least idea needs done Fall.

Let go virtual next summer chance get kids back track. I'm expecting colleges this, Cleveland State, Rutgers, Cornell requiring vaccines already fall semester, still 5 months next semester. One problem testing kids there’s two-day window virus detectable, IIRC. negative test doesn’t really tell much. Wisconsin stronger surge earlier due surpreme court striking closures mask mandate.  Michigan Minnesota much stricter closures nearly big surges. it’s likely natural immunity slowing spread. N501Y nelly would safest choice. It’s common problem, everyone vaccine sites temperatures taken, Covid symptom checklists done giving shots. No. numbers protection contacting disease. protection hospitalization death much higher. still waiting ebola vaccine case paying attention, Fauci Trump start thing taking every position is, right ""Don't wear masks, nothing"" March 2020 current ""Are saying masks work?! fundamentally disagree, Sen. Paul!! Harrumph!!""

Fauci time throughout 2020-21. example, double masking. initially said evidence it, week saying ""it's common sense, one good two offer protection"" Bro, consider introvert. most. leave, won't. even I'm starting go stir crazy. much hated going work everyday really realize much effecting mental health positive way. Seems like thing enjoy anymore getting drunk, that's mostly makes numb. I’ve already Pfizer dose moron.

Vaccination STATUS analogous HIV, HPV, etc STATUS. bars screen HPV vaccine too? END PASTY FEARFUL FUCKS!!! BARS ALLOWED DISCRIMINATE REASON get vaccine worry getting it... afraid go hide rock Where’s evidence that? You’re making lots claims don’t see anything support fear mongering kids recommend insane things like putting masks babies. currently evidence kids experiencing life long term, lifelong damage covid infections large scale. 

I understand kids get virus aren’t magically immune, small number get really sick. it’s going year kids vaccinated large scale, small number willing damage lives kids? may agree that, many people don’t aren’t going lock kids away vaccines available.

She'll able tell grandkids vaccine pioneer. cool. observation whenever shouting doomsday covid it’s osterholm. Many predictions flat around wrong far. about? talking proof vaccination, medical diagnosis. two things way. 

Good luck traveling future! :-D Suit yourself. drag others it.

Besides, look around you. People longer care going intensify. Could worse. read story guy colonoscopy sort one laxatives totally cleared day procedure. story goes took laxative proceeded destroy toilet next 12 hours leaving quivering wreck became empty tube. next day hobbled hospital promptly told week early come back 7 days later. gave another laxative sent home. That's works. vaccine 66% efficacy mean work 34%. works 100% people, reducing illness recipients. difficult quantify exactly much reduces illness individual, figure that, safe assume 34% still got ill, almost mild symptoms, would much severe without.

You simply compare 66% 70% population needing immunised herd immunity. instead need look percentage people whose transmission significantly reduced, that's 100% recipients vaccine. J&amp;J alone provide herd immunity. Aye. 

Just remember - vaccine doesn’t mean won’t ever get sick COVID, symptoms hopefully mean won’t die. 😱 realize people cross borders, oceans, overpay home good school districts value educating kids. isnt offloading them. could afford it, would switched private year. Since couldn't, rest middle lower class stuck watching kids miss tried desperately make difference educationally keeping roof heads.

It's wonderful kids home 13 months. still best Isolated peers teachers long. something useful contrarian? ""get used it"" type deal, online education AWFUL. 
 
Yet ask almost anyone think Khan Academy praise. Ok, making appointment tomorrow! NJ one leaders shots share shots used doubt, one dose Pfizer/Moderna better one dose JnJ. 

I say that. understanding comparisons point still apples apples equivalent CDC test Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine completes. J&amp;J approved two months later Pfizer Moderna vaccines assuming effectiveness test started relative time takes amount time complete data roughly beginning June. Duh? Oh really, Fauci? get smart, wonder? point kind school reopening means mass infections kids. Although studies it’s outside activities that’s driving spread. 

So unless kids dying they’ll keep schools open parent's standpoint absolutely correct.

The kicker know there's long term effects kids yet.

So gamble.  think parents understand kids need back school, society, entirely know short term gain could offset lifeline debilitating illness. Good ol Schraderbrau Ask Argentinian president. get that, even said almost exactly said, another reply thread...

I really musing statistics weird. Like Birthday Paradox. Remember vaccine necessarily prevent infection, lessen severity mortality received ""boatloads"" government funding Germany. BNT received lot money new production facility Marburg producing vaccines couple weeks - nothing Q1 Belgian plant. issues major

I would argue delivering 17% ordered product Croatia, depends almost exclusively AZ major issue them. made errors uncanny Big Pharma realities. far average percent people received first doses within population world 4.7%.
Germany currently seating 12%.

Good know agree though. Cheers! Sure, demand need move on. Mass fine, filling instantly, people want groups definitely confused second. that? I'm legitimately asking. think societal implications covid pandemic, worth talking about. Captain Obvious Mine tomorrow I’m bouncing excitement. Longest 21 days EVER.

People relationships change age. Things get complicated kids picture. suffering, yah Haha let out. feel that. I’ve read it’s 90% effective couple weeks first dose you’re almost there.. stay strong good UK.

Well, that's sure. also good mutual relations UK closest neighbor, EU. one lies constantly repeated reddit EU chauvinists hide incompetence EU admitted to. 

However, ban export *some* vaccine related materials - think including glass vaccine vials certain types filters. I've never seen many people worried education sudden. 

Kids low income areas special need students always needed help, disproportionately affected everything. normal basis (as non-pandemic year) danger graduating / well life general. Yet general public always ignores normal year, refuses pay taxes add additional funding Title programs (which mostly target populations), etc.

I'm speaking specifically, general public sudden vested interest education low income / special needs students conveniently. me, dishonest talking point anything. people could give two shits ELLs/SPED/Title I/Low SES students. reddit moment Vaccines Labor Unions, Silent/Greatest generations fought Ave many uphill battles set boomer kids think everything right world. I’m curious farm worker photo wearing N95 despite outdoors working alone... Same. days really bleeding point. someone trying talk word definition, may want look endemic: implies regionality. “Denoting area particular disease regularly found.”

""cut out"" necessary, guy lol well Fauci said Makes sense me. make campus safe students.

Hopefully mandate employees campus get vaccinated well. Yeah, children survive thousands years human civilization without public school teachers immediate presence?

The reality people time resources care children terrible US society present. Instead fixing paying parents stay home, take care help educate kids, government decided nothing, play everyone teachers school staff, spread kinds hysteria ""damage"" children. US export ban. 

This keeps debunked truth-challenged keep repeating it. antibody treatment works vaccine. jawed vertebrate immune system pretty amazing. It’s rude it’s honest. Let’s make sure everyone travel around. case positivity rate would higher. That’s one reasons it’s reported. It’s basically measurement whether there’s enough testing going on. thought children immune? That's username's namesake said. /s tough balance. generally believe processes place, also think regulators usually incentivized releasing bad drugs, rather saving lives. old adage conventional never gets fired, even regulators may save lives unconventional. old saying finance ""you never get fired losing money IBM."" 

Basically normal times. Every day vaccine delayed thousands people die. Thats makes respecting regulations much difficult. may fact prove durable face new variants, weigh convenience single dose J&amp;J shot. say racing helmet protects car crash seatbelt, who'd want put one every time get car? sciences use specific unique terms explain position, terms always compatible common ""layperson"" terms. Science often needs translator, even specialties. Meanwhile Alberta Kenny says ""well people break rules anyways, careful"" Herd immunity going abroad, concert, cinema also choice. know endemic means? exception smallpox (technically still exists lab), diseases still around. great US eradicated diseases (more less) irrelevant, endemic. Yeah, this. funny thing weak ""lockdown"" basically pisses *everyone* off. 

If part pro-economy crowd, hate ""lockdown"" capriciously forces small businesses shutter suffer schools, big box stores Amazon warehouses still go full-tilt.

If part pro-containment crowd, hate ""lockdown"" measures half-assed much *actually* slow spread - optics.

Doses current historians already KNOW lol getting downvoted! fun! situation Austria paired one incompetent governments ever had. alone, worry. Many things change stick around pandemic. Virtual K-12 really shouldn’t one them. doesn’t work well all. 

Virtual learning makes sense college classes, potentially upper grades high school, even ass effective valuable person learning.

They use AMERICAN technology say America 3th world!! think try opinion societal changes academia, may want proof read posts. might come across better next time. enlightened claim be, know number parent's ""dislike"" kids want offloaded few. parents feel way moment feel way forced situation one ever anticipated kids- hate kids, need break. since kids idea actually feels like; knowing bunch parents listening talk parenting living yourself. I'm saying gives worst case opinion. gives worst case, best case, case opinions. He's map time. know drawing conclusions person said know jack. True. people saying ""it's probably allergies"" opting get tested, whereas would get tested. probably allergies never completely sure covid unless get tested.  Statistics weird. studies anecdotal evidence vaccine symptoms blood type? seen Type blood may less severe Covid symptoms, wondering that's case mRNA vaccine response well. Well vulnerable people childish demanding stay inside could part voluntarily isolate. Yet saw bars restaurants filled old people. mean guess male could pee pregnancy test. wonder it'd register negative would like register anything? tangent - cornell , along princeton - real tough ivy league schools Yes, find odd people say ""teachers babysitters"" later downthread say kids struggling remote school need parents better teaching like...is teaching specialized profession not? mom dad it, then, well, glorified babysitter? They've sort devalued profession Covid debates. US *is* sharing, stockpiling available vaccine, like said are. used “Good News” flair post, that’s people asking. anecdotal experience isn’t based actual data, ie test positivity rate increasing. really contraindications vaccine. fact, people health conditions encouraged get vaccine. look Victorian era. Ok Thanks Canada delay first dose too? /s reddit told America third world country gucci belt would jump border tangerine? Let's waterboard ourselves! Yeah going age vulnerability. Really maybe like .01% anyone 30 needs vaccine. Yeah...no.  That’s virus knows going children low blow therefore would infect children. I've got idea (not USA), hence question. Pretty good since would presume ones administered Good Friday Everyone goes Florida spring break. Look map...its places brutal winters...spring comes everyone gets outta here! abortion instead? They're getting education right now, online. Two months online learning going kill them. They'll able get vaccine summer they'll ready next school year. get many vaccines April whole 2021 far! May June even get vaccines. Many people getting shots Syracuse Binghamton, got mine today Ithaca vaccine available everyone. That's it. vaccine trials conducted different environments different times data yet exist compare them. vaccines approved use US safe effective. statement (or even suggestion) contrary harmful misinformation.

So cut out. [Slitta fine mese il target delle 500mila iniezioni al giorno: previste solo 8 milioni di dosi contro le 7,5 consegnate marzo. Veneto e Lazio hanno finito le Italy receive share doses EU March (with quota, slightly population quota). So... No. stats Pfizer data Israel. incredibly incredibly unlikely. Unfortunately ultimatums don’t exist real world. under-researched real argument? virus death rate around 1% less (because can't take account asymptomatic people recorded), mostly elderly, also inflated false positives deaths *with covid* registered ""by covid"" requires everyone URGENTLY gets vaccine.
   
There's something extremely fishy this. Funny covid coincidentally happens meet UN's Agenda 2030, Bill Gates' ID2020 WEF's Great Reset (""You'll nothing happy""). People better start listening, whatever is, sinister. Prove wrong half wit vaccine trials conducted different environments different times data yet exist compare them. vaccines approved use US safe effective. statement (or even suggestion) contrary harmful misinformation. 

So cut out. fully approved FDA, commercial mRNA therapy decades development?  That's reassuring it? big difference effectiveness hospitalization rates, first off- numbers wrong. 

Second off, asterisk reason. obvious caveats here. 33% country get vaccine &lt; 1% 5% vaccinated people may go hospital, mathematically speaking statistically significant majority people hospitalized three months opted get vaccine.

So original point still stands. Whether final number 60%, 80%, 99%, whoever ends hospital three months vast majority done complicit spreading right thing getting vaccinated. Socializing school fixes that, that’s people doing. Lowered germ skill socially different remote. understanding J&amp;J trial conducted later trial participants likely exposed variants opposed moderna Pfizer. seems Pfizer moderna proving reasonably effective variants. choose would pick Pfizer. Effective 2nd dose 3 weeks. got moderna wait 4 weeks. Still happy ""Improving"" good. odd compare weekly deaths daily deaths, even though people math.

Imagine somehow talked families 900+ people died particular day. Try telling situation quite good. Every single one. Obviously that's impossible, thought experiment, think they'd say?

When thousands Americans still dying per week, that's *inherently* bad. life death ***the*** thing matters. can't understand many people can't understand that. need doctor tell that. objectively true. agree it’s unlikely US use AZ doses given options, lot countries don’t options. AZ cost effective easiest store, US probably donating 309 mill doses developing world.

In general developing world use AZ, Russian Chinese vaccines can’t get AZ. US EU swallow first orders others vaccines, time essence. 

There major issues, fundamentally vaccine works. It’s people’s arms. felt perfectly safe (biology degree 10 years working scicomm, means anything) hair! /s correct answer here. People need stop non-scientific comparison judgments vaccines here. fair, harder pull off. One robber masks though, might work. Lol. Like bleach rubbing alcohol, huh?

BTW Reddit rules impersonate real person misleading way. Sure, couple incidents isn’t reason deprive kids education. dose error reason (check it; dose changed). time doses, jointly demographics recipients. subsequent inquiry EMA, NIH CDC helped clarify facts.

Data reporting clear-cut rules everyone business, without exemption, knows. AZ failing comply another mistake great caliber.

Does matter frame it, trials shame. Well shit threshold consider low enough risk?  


Mitigation risk relative risk, include factors. COVID definitely flu, also definitely smallpox.  you’d tie mask way couldn’t come off, let baby chew potentially asphyxiate? Seems logical.

Give break, man. It’s unreasonable expect babies wear masks. TIL, people reddit know supply demand works. okay careful CDC basically said travel meeting others small groups (especially others vaccinated) low risk answered someone days ago w 14 days, moderna pretty freaking effective. Rolling day 14 tomorrow nothing left public today surreal exciting experience! Definitely. That's kids also think would funny lick hand touch another student gross out. I've couple students class think they're hilarious. That's reddit vitamin thing, think author refers called vitamin B17, really vitamin, amygdalin. sold cancer cure. problem gets contact stomach acid releases cyanide. one cares \^ much this! vaping I've able stay cigs almost 5 years now.  'Antibacterial genes' keep spreading viruses?? What? can't serious. It’s likely adolescent EUA fall I'm teacher well we've couple incidents. often, happen. unlikely much likely still much virus country. We're still 60,000+ cases day plateau we've increasing.

Maybe little little kids may try kids think germs gross. way convince baby wear shoes jacket, hat gloves.  dad right. pandemic ain’t over. dude, point I'm trying make situation blown way proportion. virus known covid-19 spreading killing people? yes, doubt. usually mentioned fact virus usually kills people older average life expectancy would otherwise die ""normal"" flu. mean care? no. means justify new culture unbridled obedience, fear-mongering people + media, worshipping healthcare experts government everything say. especially introduction immunization, vaccine widespread, virus reduced nothing flu. requiring things would otherwise never require viruses similar shows needlessly scared people are. 

if disagree me, cool, power you, back forth going anywhere lmao, let's end it. school already said vaccine requirements proof prior infection suffice. yeah- thats true also protects people vaccinated didn’t develop immunity  someone actually works school, tell kids extremely compliant, I’ve essentially issues masks minimal problems distancing, sure, make huge assumption based think kids without actual experience. Since vaccines already required enter university, imagine already case law precedent this.

This another vaccine list already required vaccines. It’s going great Quebec they’ve administered 1.5M vaccines (mostly 1 dose), adult population Quebec 6.1M people, that’s 25%, current giving around 300k vaccinations week, modest ramp up, that’s 50% adult Quebeckers end month, that’s UK cases, hospitalizations, deaths flatlined. randos world? Yeah sorry 99% people care.

I say 99%. people moral compass, true, lot people care stranger dies. Unfortunately, ***that's profoundly immoral every ethical system exists.*** France usually lower number vaccinations weekends vaccine centers remain open. reported mean, find zero science don’t look all? keep on? kid long ago surprise saw doofuses running around coughing kids think funny. What’s point? Florida lockdowns. Fortunately also warm weather inhibits virus’s ability transmit. Bon appétit! black white like think is. Yes, scenario would traumatizing year minimal social interaction stunted education also traumatizing think private universities shouldn’t treated normal private businesses since actually receive lot public funding tax breaks (as way make continue existing take poorer students, Albeit get exploitative)

That said pfizer fda approved classes it’s issue

That said think it’s fair question requiring vaccine moment institutions people already attend? midway degree would almost Definitly strong court case really doesn’t matter. they’re home take meet friends, without masks… transmission paths school… see parents masked kids babies masks anything. that? that?

Kids suffering academically, socially, emotionally due virtual learning teachers vaccinated, argument bring back emotional health alone  isn’t true. Covid much contagious flu. US, despite extraordinary measures, covid killed 20x many people would normally die flu. isn’t weird reporting flu vaccines (which modestly successful taken lot people). Covid much deadlier disease. Full stop. 

Flu vaccine uptake US 50%.

Nice try. ones open full person learning last month. People kids thinking they'd actually take care them. We'll pretend education instead that, though

Really, though, indictment economic system difficult one parent stay home now. vaccines didn’t work gave honest shot

We given honest shot yet, people vaccinated. well known vaccines work population level, individual level. much less likely spread covid someone kill vaccinated, impossible *until herd immunity*.

There numerous examples like Vietnam Thailand true. key rigorous corona response and/or population respecting restrictions. 

Poor countries may better rich countries money. Pfizer far research (from Israel UK) shown really, really good. Moderna's basically identical code 3.3x dose. J&amp;J demonstrably weaker real-world conditions (even compared single pfizer), still quite effective. I'm curious. michigan minnesota poorly wisconsin okay comparison? Knowing age knowing medical information two different things lol

Yeah bars able check vaccination status HIV status, right??? wouldn’t want UNKNOWINGLY put risk HIV meeting someone HIV+ bar!!!!!!!!! get distinction adults children this. Maybe humans general spread strains. ""Experts""

Who? disagree all; lowest performing students worse ever, clear online learning working vast majority (at least incarnation total bollocks). There's also J&amp;J vaccine, one I'm getting. (Not choice, I'm taking first one available, appointment happens place handing J&amp;J.)

No new technology there. really many people club.

Second dose pfizer tomorrow morning. Nervous getting side affects, first dose. trying refute anecdotal evidence anecdotal evidence? agree 100% gave year lives protect vulnerable elderly get return ""normal life"" don't?

I think Get grip. Early last year hesitant go anything like normal person. didn’t know enough. It’s year plus, we’ve learned lot. I’m essential worker gone work every damn day fine cdc recommended stuff. I’ve hung friends outdoor bars we’ve ok. I’ve got parents fully vaccinated, closest friends one dose 3 us doses.

the problem months year ahead seems [south african 351 rumor going around since polio vaccine started. Plus lots kids can't/won't pay attention even show virtual classes. 
 
So like regular school then. fail show class certain amount police get involved end juvenile hall probation. 
 
There TED Talk Salmon Khan virtual learning discusses benefits person learning. One kids learn different things different speeds impossible cater person learning. teacher spends ten minutes covering something 10% class understand it, teacher stop spend longer 10% 90% lose out. Versus virtual learning students pause replay something multiple times, ability pause arbitrary amount time understand concept move on. 
 
If they're treating covid induced virtual classes strictly live versions person learning, they're right. pre-recorded lectures live help sessions. gotta open schools because... reasons. Wait, production problems actually Oxford got greedy picked less-competent partner would give larger share... that’s less favorable, plausible, narrative sure. original comment ""No company willing offer cost."" source establish that. want reframe ar saying focus later comment's ""to entire world"" part, okay, seems correct--but article support anything ""at cost"" ""at cost."" operate old standards haven’t updated 9 month. link 💙 wrong. Vaccinations shown eliminate possibility death hospitalization feel makes feel better, thanks vaccines, deaths lower ever (at least states). 

I encourage things said, especially teeth part. get sick, advancements made, you’re gonna fine. Trust me. easily spread survivable (for you) virus

Repeated emphasis.

A lot people *just want understand point*. correct, that’s masks important. going depend field well. everyone wants interrupted coworkers two minute conversations day, conducive flow work every field. stuff absolutely happen virtually well daily/weekly check ins, constant posts Teams asking input/advice employees, etc. Virtual work well people using it, there's nothing stopping people interacting much, more, virtually would office. fact, would say team members communicate much online would office us open time day chat person, us take 2-3 minutes write quick comment message Teams. 

Like said, work everyone, totally disagree idea going virtual inherently bad everyone's productivity interconnectivity office. Hospitalizations Michigan surging faster rate Autumn peak, deaths increasing still relatively low due younger people hospitalized, fatality rate much lower School starts tomorrow spring breakers really start spreading infectious variants. Really speculation. Moderna's trialing 10 micrograms (1/10 current dose) seems like would good booster candidate. Lower doses give less side effects (and fewer antibodies, linearly trials). brought enough share can. already do. children already deal math lung scaring, organ damage, neurological damage, etc. every adult vaccinated, still get suffer whole lives form aftermath virus. child free sub bitter incredibly sad sub. 

They’re horrible people. We’re going live limbo forever. certain point you’re vulnerable can’t get vaccine it’s responsibility take care yourself, society’s responsibility take care you. Many countries extended Oxford vaccine gap long 12 weeks, citing better efficacy compared 4 weeks gap. Experts say vaccine effective second shot. also say efficacy matter available vaccines good preventing severe cases. country wait 3 months vaccine take affect. 4 week gap considered, vaccine results seen month. understand government seeing this. Giving 4 week gap, aid stopping spread much sooner, i.e. month. Yes, longer gap, larger population vaccinated, vaccines available. 
Can someone please explain? really get it. Oh God, I’m clearly speaking specifically within context whether feel safe 1 week Pfizer shot vs. 2 weeks Pfizer shot, studies show 1 week still 90% protection. 

So yeah, context, people **absolutely can** whatever hell comfortable with. protects yourself, protects others likelihood asymptomatic transmission extremely low. 

Learn read. like we're may 2020 Dude said wanted fix Hopium, fucking OD I’d fight him.! know China already? Yeah pharmacist saying take prevent symptoms link say take prevent side effects. mean either ended 100.8 fever headache next night wonder Tylenol delayed immune response. Telling private businesses whether cannot decide business vaccinated unvaccinated people stupid. 

Business can, meantime, enforce requirement Covid vaccine want. That’s right. It’s right citizen decide don’t want vaccine enforce presence business don’t want business I've seen articles nightclubs breaking rules, guess completely back normal. Although really get expect sort social distancing there. Vaccines stopping transmission get herd immunity. Vaccinating children (starting 12-15 group they're trialing now, 16-17 ages currently pfizer) reduce transmission also contribute. absolutely studied transmission proved vaccines effective stopping asymptomatic asymptomatic spread, even among exposed virus most. vaccinated don’t get extra liberties government likes people. It’s actually safe things, that’s they’re allowed. would matter said ""Merck guarantee could offered cost entire world"" - guaranteeing could exported world makes inevitable could guarantee could offered cost world.

Piece paper makes life normal lmfao. Dumb fuck. Smh. No, knew. I’m dramatic Reddit. Yup, mean still see em yeah seems like ever since shots started going people said fuck it. dare CDC update first dose shots:

2,001,446 first dose shots. Last week 1,923,434

7 day rolling avg 1,797,680. 1,786,536 yesterday. 

**The cdc site seems moved data around adjusted percentages data seems strange**

103.6m adults first doses - 40.2% (down 41.1%)


75.1% 65+ done (up 75%)

At rate, first dose shots:

**Adult population numbers**

End of:

April - 150.4m 58.3%

May - 206.1m - 79.9%


50% 4/19

Again, adult numbers moved wrong way percentage went added less 100k new shots. I'm guessing tomorrow better.

Also cell phone easter dinner hopefully right trustworthy would say post's are?

meet someone disreguarded everything ""it's reddit"" I’m 2 hours post first Pfizer shot feel nothing whatsoever. remember hearing lot talking points last summer provincial government (Ontario) weighing options September. felt too- kids wild, they’re place, can’t possibly work. month January, schools open since September, kids adapted quickly. I’ve come realize that, talk kids uncontrollable, lot rules might even taking advantage fact kids controlled. Imagine telling grown adult want take sip water, must go stand corner 20 people stare nervously back. Imagine telling bunch adults allowed talk eat. Imagine telling “ok, it’s 10:15, time go wash hands! Bobby, seemed little quick, go back line properly time.” friend dropped kids one morning, realized one forgot water bottle. couldn’t go back since she’s teacher herself, called school ask whether could give plastic bottle something. Nope, sorry, b/c covid. Imagine telling adult they’re shit options manage without water day. doesn’t take much adult feel condescended therefore defensive, majority children used told don’t take personally. Workplaces put sorts guidelines, end day really faith person working next shares sense risk aversion, trust mask wearing clean, trust washed hands last time went bathroom, trust didn’t pop Advil Cold Flu morning didn’t want call sick, trust didn’t fam dinner weekend. Obviously variants nothing concerned about. [/sarcasm] got mine today well! actually know? Genuinely curious. always option homeschool kid. never anything stopping prior this. even schools designed specifically it. Holy shit. RIP lungs right way school home schooling vaccination widespread. obvious. Public schools don't/cant costs money instead makes it.

They anyway. CDC update first dose shots:

2,001,446 first dose shots. Last week 1,923,434

Again, adult numbers moved wrong way percentage went added less 100k new shots. I'm guessing tomorrow better Yep office got vaccinated back January 2 holdouts got first dose last month! Yeah things started going hill June, pretty neutral October, rough moments life really kicked negative spiral. wake every morning trying pull back go right direction, never seem get momentum past day two. protect kids letting normal kids enjoy life. not, like miracle. miracle  There's lot counter-messaging though. see comments everywhere. People saying 80% effectiveness means 100 people get vaccine, 20 people still contract COVID. no. GO GATORS Sure, seems like world freaking wrong thing. Numbers vaccinations low confirmed COVID must wait until, believe, two weeks recovering. good immune system fighting virus trying deal shot too. also puts vaccinators, volunteers people vaccine line high risk.  Right rise cases globally due UK variant homegrown variants similar different mutations? NYC schools mass surveillance testing since like October. little community spread schools despite spikes city time. someone wants wait research done covid vaccine, makes antivaxxer?

This perfect example common idiot shouldn’t charge anything Man, I'm way. Last March-June actually pretty well. Reading more, eating better, cooking meals, going walks, working out...it great! starting July switched. Started getting back working normal hours nice while...but going work back home started getting really lazy. Eating like crap, good stuff. Back late 70s California required measles shot school. Turned mine young. sister measles toddlers 60s vaccinated expecting exposed hoping would afford protection (I never got measles). Jr High checked records Measles shot young age missed 3 days school waiting get family doctor get measles shot.

The kicker doctor looked records afterwards found vaccinated measles second time knowing first early. Thus measles vaccine 3 times. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* automod bot already explained VAERs bit, expound further: 100 million US adults received COVID vaccine. would expect random population 100 million adults nearly 100,000 would die within 30 day window vaccination sheer coincidence. 

Vaccine safety taken seriously adverse events reasonably linked vaccines definitely investigated. addition, potential *patterns* events detected higher expected rates, analysis done see reaches statistical significance. far, statistically significant serious adverse event detected currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines United States (outside aforementioned rare acute allergic reaction common injected pharmaceutical). Got second Pfizer dose Thursday - best bday present ever! Didn’t side effects, woke Friday feeling surprisingly amazing. arm wasn’t even sore. So, happy us awful year.   Lots spread already happened, especially border big cities. people say could 3-10x actual number cases know, I’d guess high end many areas Texas. 

People cities still generally wearing masks, especially crowded places. rural areas never really wore them, nothing changed much there. city live 35% adults one dose- isn’t bad. rate we’re going, may 50% couple weeks. huge vaccine drives every weekend even one shot helps ton. surge everyone predicted hasn’t happened, thankfully. aware biggest European nation, Germany, sent troops joint NATO exercises using brooms rifles real ones worthless? say Scot voted Remain, little Englander here.

And we're it, person time defence minister made Germany armed forces laughing stock (you see subs)? Ursula von der Leyen. Macron keen weak leader could influence place she'd even office. spread school year summer? Today went driving air truly feels different. anyone else feel same? It’s nice hot outside, second dose Pfizer scheduled tomorrow. feels way different time last year. Definitely feels lot hopeful. No. People “just whatever comfortable with” point protect community best can. yourself. Yup. happens 30 year olds flu too. met absolute fools college dorms touring California recently. Said things like every single person dorm caught COVID-19 drank infection.. people pre existing conditions got long term illness. Scary stuff, course makes sense. dentist antivaxxer ought lose license SAME! Well, first dose Wednesday just... dont want fuck finish line damn want just.. normal. One month I'm fully vaccinated able experience that. gotta stay patient. want follow science point, start get bored.

Are also raided people stuck timeline vaccine invented? April 2020; fatigued, focus getting vaccinated. parents looked seeing mental health specialist? jobs fill, workforce come. still countless people struggling without jobs. 4-5 months train whatever background checks might needed. may perfect solution, something would starting point. we’re already spending extra funds unemployment benefits; spend least money putting least people back work instead? that’s goal government programs like original New Deal recent proposals build infrastructure — put people back work benefit society whole.

again, i’m saying it’s necessary, turned children 51% chance turning zombie, know we’d find way deal keeping isolated. latter, likely. Reopening everything virus still spreading aggressively good idea. Sure probably die received vaccine someone else still catch logic still applies before. Cover face holes avoid crowds. hard comprehend? new variant stage could potentially put back year ago. places still seeing new infections last Spring. like gone less half population vaccinated. real going make US vulnerable avalanche variant cases. Yep, that's also needed many get shot. huge swath people get vaccine, want go hunt appointment. want told ""there walk-in clinics here, here, here. Show up, get vaccinated within 10 minutes."" virus inactivated UV lab mean sun makes lick difference human hosts, unfortunately. get it. I’ve work wasn’t choice (I teach elementary) nowhere else. Curbside groceries, gatherings. place I’ve house work two doctors appointments. sucks, see people acting like nothing outside normal going don’t get it. also can’t wait get back normalcy second dose last week, although think I’ll still wearing mask quite while! new dentist

Ah, someone knows better medical professionals! Lmao Hey thats Birthday!! I'll 2nd shot sooooo looking forward cold beer bar change. Wild think may happened pulse oximeter home... I'm glad made ER, hope Christmas better one. Well ofc, think people don’t think they’ll never get covid, think lowers chances getting it. pretty much entirely shots administered week, though. real telling update weekend Tuesday's. Papers, please. Lol wat. mean, better global tracker? Except world needs vaccines, gotta count US out. That's OP said ""if"" twice referring boosters. asymptomatic cases highly contagious variants, saying could reduce risk 30% isn’t always going work I’d ideally want prepared worst case. It’s simplistic calculation end sure, risk also increases people household members outside exposure, think it’s still appropriate way communicate downfalls getting herd immunity. South Park episode seek erase time travelers future everyone participating exclusively homosexual orgies Don’t forget: handguns kill SARS-CoV-2, too. UV inactivation lab necessarily correlate anything relevant outside lab. It’s probably mix larger mask compliance fact people general staying vigilant first months, US people protesting mitigation measures middle April 2020, cops breaking Covid parties summer. Every experience different. 10 year old caught near grade level reading. caught fully math.

He 3 years behind grade level reading 2 math.

Remote school boom academically.

Things black white. clinical trials following patient's vaccine affects them. part, seen many complications J&amp;J Moderna vaccines. allergic reactions towards it, nothing major. case astrazeneca vaccine, however, studies found blood clots. me, real time study following patient long period time. might using wrong term, call ""real time aging"" medical devices. let product sit shelf 2-3 years see affects product. accelerated aging get product market, real time aging efficacy FDA asks it. 

For me, I'm waiting long get vaccine. agree, evidence pointing vaccine fine. However, know real time long term side effects, enough time passed ""real time aging."" country close vaccinated 1% pop day, lot states hitting milestone getting near it. new hampshire vaccinating 1.85% pop day, tahts head shoulders new york, second place vaccinating 1.37% population day Didn’t guys decide business could refuse sell gay people? suspect well. There's even guy comment section said something among lines ""tomorrow microchip"". Hubble telescope can't even see goalposts anymore. 12-16 year olds able get summer. Teachers fully vaccinated months. It’s insane even question. I’m safe working environments vaccine 95 percent effectiveness SYMPTOMATIC illness enough enough. Get shot get back damn classroom Quit talking shit like getting vaccine responsible yellow orange state. New Jersey vaccinated 20% state, cases still going up. Citizens vaccine clinics ready poke people, allotment vaccines stagnated. 

Not every state reporting covid cases, every state handled obtaining vaccine supplies way. Northeast also densest part country. Even going grocery shopping, stores never dead, almost always line wait in. 

Maybe cases going school openings, lot simpler blame ordinary citizens case numbers going up. Hospitalizations state around 50,000 coming holidays whereas now, state 2,300. 

You're seriously making enemy fellow citizen can't objectively review data? fair that’s different usual routine. got dental insurance year first time. Yeah, you’re ignorant, chance. course does, matter much Redditors site keep trying argue otherwise. One player officially reinfected. Here’s quote: “Postmedia confirmed Hawryluk indeed positive case, meaning second time he’s tested positive COVID-19. one handful Ottawa Senators caught virus shortly 2019-20 season went pause last March. Research shown P.1 variant capable reinfecting people previously suffered strains coronavirus causes COVID-19.” think mask wearing, part mask wearing many situations people outside household. Even places US may almost people masked public still seem 20 person parties someone's house mask seen 5 minutes everyone arrives. Meanwhile tried go doctor’s office post-COVID fatigue related anxiety refused see without COVID test COVID symptoms.

No shit, *because* COVID. False equivalency. threat people's freedom way life. case, threat people's freedom way life virus, reaction it. feel like places masking made noticeable difference retail stores. private situations people don’t restaurant masks entirely pointless. people actually masked private prior maybe would’ve seen difference clearly never case definitely strong seasonal element it. 2020 certainly evidence that! it, fortunately mild case it. senses smell taste greatly diminished totally lost. lasted two weeks taste three four weeks smell. felt better days. months I'm fine, antibody levels still good. understand lucky others much worse really don’t care opinions anti-vaxxers. everyone country full access vaccine fully opened. think parent poster correct, neither you. Remote work massively improved productivity company. people worse, level better. 

This company plans much permissive remote arrangements going forward. estimate 85% jobs remote supervisor/employee discretion.

To say everything less productive simply accurate all.

Additionally, know students excelling home. teen daughter autistic done much better remote education. Meanwhile teen son Adhd done absolutely horrible.

It's black white imply. possible disturbed one thing! Please stop lying making things up. garbage misinformation could get people killed. Yeah checked 36% 1 dose 20% fully vaccinated may look like behind since still one phase one phase includes 3rd population it’s ok stay longer true, close schools 4 days plus holidays, now. Stores closed. Macron dare call lockdowb pretty much everything allowed? suggest wearing mask vaccination. That’s point. dont get cool alliteration though... Granted, schools like Cornell usually wealthy families paying much Especially college students. many extra calories burn receiving vaccine? Building immune system must take energy right? wear mask beach? way wear anywhere.

but agree ok swimming… that’s going work hah still take steps to protect others in many situations, like wearing mask, staying least 6 feet apart others, avoiding crowds poorly ventilated spaces. Take precautions whenever unvaccinated people one unvaccinated person at increased risk severe illness death COVID-19 or lives person increased risk

Not fan nuance you? call strain Boris117? really fault UK, think stupid politicians refused wear masks insisted shaking hands probably led variant . topic? Well, months ago would asked someone suggested passports would one day happen, fitting pretty goddamn well. descriptivism prescriptivism says article can’t anymore, literally says exactly want explain opposite :D Losing?

Uh, think little late that. medical records... going NBC News break New Mexico's numbers, note dashboard lags behind raw data days technicalities though NM still leading nation vaccination rates sizable margin. JFC post. european reading MSNBC first time mimicking one? getting vaccinated choice. even though flu vaccine like 50% effective, require vaccine passports flu enter movie theatre travel? not? choice take vaccine natural risk life contract respiratory illness. trying police people's choices name ""the greater good"" fucked up. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Be safe there! Wild West anything goes now. moral ideology others fear.

This another thing that’s gets repeated ad nauseum. dramatic entirely misses point. Textbook strawman changing argument make easier attack. 

This moral ideology. hanging another month (maybe 2) people vaccinated. go back normal. concept damn difficult people acknowledge? Sure nuts always wear mask attack people wearing one, tiny fraction population (similar nutty anti-maskers). Quit making grand show conflicting ideologies. want make sure squash covid.

7 confirmed deaths UK low, given many 18-50 year olds already vaccinated. Something like 25% people age group already vaccinated, many AZ. least couple million 18-50 year olds already received AZ, that's low end estimate. 

So, here's things could considerably dangerous getting AZ jab young person:
- Riding motorbike 30 miles
- Going general anaesthetic (for reason)
- Going one skydiving jump c'mon dude Poland style lockdown. everywhere adults go mingle everyday still open masks mandated recommended.

it end badly… Regardless, older adults (I.e., high risk) vaccinated. specific reason New England well vaccinations whole, good state policies overall (but coordinated) causing (or something else)? 6 states (ME, NH, VT, MA, RI, CT) top 10 percentage 1st doses administered. Mass' one dose percentage 4% higher fully vaccinated 3.5% higher lol what....a more? Maybe partial lock downs next 10 years? 

Hospitals keeping up. Even Michigan. Vents open. 

Remember original goal? Don’t worry soon scream great Isreal it’s vax pass killing Grandma supporting this. can't tell they're vaccinated not. Maybe are. Maybe aren't. Probably are, it? What's point wasting mental energy deciding angry? Sure, like Poland saved attacked, even mentioned Ukraine.

This NATO countries attacked another nation, that's Russia wants kill that's Ukraine attacked tried join it. pertussis

A.K.A. Whooping cough, case anyone wondering. surprise went Osterholm quotes   hear people skip second shot since case covid replaced first shot, heard getting easier average obesity rates. 60% population overweight (one lowest nation). true states overweight one medical condition opens 75%+ population - exception here. agree. I'll wear mask close colleague cold I'm used protection beats take sick day! Plus I'll wear one togo somewhere I'm ill. expect others so. Meanwhile dose one Moderna knocked tf like full day felt like got punched arm boxer 4 days. 

35 yo pretty young active fit. thought would nbd. I’m getting next shot Friday I’m going take day off. overkill vaccine passport ? someone smoked 22 years, I'd watch virgin lungs deal chain smoking 100. reckon vomiting 20.

Well, approved trials still ongoing. variants based specific states yet? may ""behind"" new york eligibility groups moment vaccinated 13% 65+ age group new york (83.8% vs. 69.1%). group really matters virus. them? think there’s going much spread swamp?

NBC News might day two old data. Investigations. Community policing. Enforcing existing gun sale laws. Updating databases. done without violence racial profiling. I'm sure downvoted. 

It obvious anyone reads anything, watches anything, talks mentally healthy people vaccine completely safe free major side effects. 

Some people can't accept view absolutely questioned. call people, ""conspiracy nuts"" ^^^TM would read long relationship learn little more.

They recited tired canard “Hospitals charge aspirin,” which, repeated, code “You safely ignore everything say.” looks like /u/flyingrock discussing %age adults vaccinated rather total population based 51% number (no state anywhere close total population), case correct comparison 40% adults nationwide vaccinated. particular factory funded Trump didn’t use DPA don’t believe, essentially concept: US gov funded factory, told Emergent run it, Emergent screwed royally, US gov taking responsibility away Emergent allocating competent companies. point would you? Genuinely curious. 2022??!! company takes people basics down, train able write code too.

I lot coding experience, plan take advantage coding sql boot camps

They also promote within vast majority cases. understanding even government UK happy travel right now, US allow tourists UK EU within last 14 days flight. course perfectly understandable. wonder reliable media thrown hints possible like September/October time.

Speaking which, reliable US media could look at? bureaucracy US EU delaying process. (I dual citizen live US).If get Amazon deliver groceries within hour, wealthy country like US better. pessimistic looks like testing roll debacle.

Also governors holding back 10% certain priority groups. production?

I would rather scientist like Merkel (quantum chemist) charge administration distribution. EU existed think Germany would rival Israelis. EU debacle mostly France's fault wanted French firm Sanofi main supplier. Unfortunately Sanofi failed make vaccine. hell happening there? kind new mutant? short-term fix, need increase wages positions. hoping that, COVID-19, we'd appreciate nursing staff more. Cap wages administrators for-profit centers bring pay front line workers.  I'm going pier anytime soon false sense variants issue, indoors out. sure mean natural immunity. impulse pretend everything normal *some* population-- anywhere near number needed herd immunity-- disheartening, really evident throughout pandemic. majority cares themselves. kind doubt it'll come press conference honest. Even he'll probably excuse variants ""we know vaccinated people spread virus"" ""not kids vaccinated"". see Biden giving green light away mask mandates anytime soon. good go test requirements understanding. country probably PITA. Iceland, New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, much Atlantic provinces common? think nearly every country (especially large country), apart select few, little envious US's vaccine supply right now, that's we're talking about.  is, pharma capital world, really needed vaccine success, good using getting vaccinated fast possible. 

But article presented presents much bleaker picture Canada's rollout is. Canada bleak late-January-February rollout supply due known easily explainable reasons. vaccine production here, supply track we've taken believe smart approach (though could use alterations select groups) basically copying UK get many people first doses possible delaying second. 

We're vaccinating good clip now. No, matching US, never going that.  well way normal summer. get everyone first dose, likely early June, probably going ""how fast Province get people second dose"" terms bottleneck, supply.

I'm really tired obsession media play horse race nations. various reasons. get tested seeing friends basic precaution, also get tested coworker mine ended testing positive. also know certain workspaces require employees get tested weekly. much. I've putting lot effort understanding point view people need get back normal recently. opinion continue tough restrictions everyone's vaccinated difference make? stay home, easy. understand lot makes people depressed unhappy.

I remember hearing one guy feeling extremely went park friend loads people safely spread out, playing music fun. fact could hear people made happier. can't relate help understand people finding tough.

But feel like rarely, ever, effort extroverts sociable people understand side. constantly made feel weird wanting something pressure makes feel worse. sure mean ban materials. pfizer/Biontech vaccines start life DNA pfizer's Chesterfield plant distributed globally various production hubs turn mRNA vaccine. vaccines sourcing components world. I'm fully vaccinated still wear mine mostly peer pressure. want get shamed/yelled at/assaulted wearing one. people vaccinated state shipped vaccines empty rural counties nobody highly-populated ones any. going long time area vaccinated enough masks go away. really, something minor, really care. like they're asking hazmat suit undergo decontamination entering store. mind. care he's anti vaxer not, care numbers real. also read someone posting similar numbers relation deaths mRNA vaccines compared traditional vaccines. get shot also want risk crazy side effects well, although rare. know someone real life who's severe itching painful skin 3 weeks Pfizer vaccine. question friend, would recommend coding course - say 6 months year - ""easy"" upgrade resume seen appreciable asset would garner good positions afterwards?

A friend another friend friend recently speaking unconnected thought could something there. Leadership - finally relief COVID - fake promises, lies, ""magic"", ""it disappear Easter."" leadership. remember, one individual's probability spreading thing matters. part equation community spread. That's great multiplier. community spread high--like still is--that makes every risk important. makes difference ""90+% effective"" ""100% effective"" matter. also regulars places like /r/collapse wanted BAD pandemic end civilization return tribal society they've prepping helps sane places texas keeping mask mandates continues effectively slow spread Lowe's yesterday Texas 60% people wearing mask. trying look bright side: maybe maskless people fully vaccinated... honestly there's huge crossover anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. Pretty soon we're going point crowd going walking around killing Never without mask. thing called rule law western countries.

If want see police shooting people break covid restrictions, humiliating public, subjecting physical punishment, recommend somewhere like Indonesia, Phillipines North Korea. Yeah. Hence need hang little longer! close, drop now? looks like we're still around 900 deaths day. That's improvement, still serious. article's February; know Dr. Fauci's still saying thing. number disappointments experts handled communication issue. Hopefully they'll learn next great pandemic.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Glad Canada followed suit Let's talk 72 hours test flight. Countries require proof vaccination, already many diseases. ... foreign tourists currently allowed here? Serious question. know still travel restrictions here, point pandemic international flights (and of) US ever stopped. Got Moderna shot afternoon; side effects sore arm get vaccines. Happy 6 weeks away full immunization. would nice work-from-home become norm social stuff (bars, restaurants, etc...) available like before. actual experience whole pandemic great me. I've loved able spend time home, unnecessary social interactions, etc. bad overall I've lost social skills going put lot effort trying sociable stuff soon. Good thing there's vaccines then. NZ plans open borders 2022 herd immunity. purchased enough Pfizer vaccinate whole adult population December. 

But article even NZ went Covid elimination. outbreaks allowed NZ learn lot Covid spreads able trace every single case. time extremely strict measures. ""curfew"" lasting half day already lockdown name. reason grouped ""didn't lockdown hard enough"" category numbers horrible. Anyone King County car planning drive Eastern Washington. Yakima big event today open 16+ definitely mostly fatigue now, second dose comes small punch ha Holy shit, amazing news! I’m happy part statistic! people today carry around fake mask exemption forms, see people carry fake vaccine cards. I’m still worried UKs blood disorder ratio approach German/Norwegian ratio sub 40 pop gets first shots en masse. hope wrong unfortunately see likely not.

Think would take offered Norway, would worried young wife same. I’m sure return here. Yeah eventually mask mandates ease they’ll get vaccine stop wearing UK started investments years back. They’ve building their
Pharma industry for
Years now. would hard Canada copy pandemic. verifies concerns issues lol Personally, think 15-20% jobs. agree avoiding autoimmune responses really important. identified many cancer specific receptors (HER2, PDL1, TIGIT, Claudin 18.2...) mAb therapies, receptors keep popping many different solid tumor types. If, onstead deriving mAbs vitro, inject mRNA encoding receptors vivo, 5 day halflife mRNA expression (mainly hepatocytes) gives wpnderfully constant signal amp asaptive immune system. seems way effective simply delivering mABs via IV. part due consistent presentation, part due innate immune activation RNA seems really prepare immune system.

Of course Phase III data still lacking, earlier trials looking extraordinary.

Both Moderna BioNtech fochsed cancer prior covid 19. delights think much pandemic accelerate adoption RNA therapeutics. ethical standpoint whole thing made even complicated existence long COVID young people, preventing deaths. Bioethicists going debating COVID vaccine rollout decades. whole new variation trolley problem, killing people versus crippling them. 

As everything else pandemic, choices suck. Stupid deceptive headline. article concerns governor's decision ease mask restrictions *in counties*. half. rural, lightly populated, agricultural based counties. Eminently reasonable. Especially since one places ever masked anyway. 

There strong correlation ACTUAL mask use decreased case load. correlation government policy case load nonexistent. That's far many. favourite holidays year, boyfriend visit me, usual stress relief nonexistent, can't see friends. bet I'm miserable omg even perform studies know outcome. Unimaginable going hit wall soon every willing person vaccinated ones left anti-vaxxers/skeptics? entire weekend. Agreed! Thank pointing out.

I never considered introvert, truly loved past year without forced interaction. 

I miss many things (Broadway shows,m, dining lively restaurant club, concerts, etc...) absolutely miss forced go subway, office parties talk weirdo co-workers.

**If wish, would work stay remote everything else open up.** gotta real sucked free social obligations EVERYBODY MUST THANK - media wish introvert towns 

Seriously thing. Imagine pure bliss. Hell let's go country. need gather whole introvert diaspora settle promised land. Could also used treat genetic diseases you’re missing protein, like Cystic fibrosis. You’d keep getting injections since mRNA would degrade stop coding won’t cure like actual gene therapy still better nothing naturally introverted, covid made feel relaxed deal people much.

Would interesting see actual changes source code virus, even impossible interpret whim Found Oprah’s throwaway rational take. increase sensationalism? Hit Twitter No, true friends European nations. undergrad, group girls intentionally got pink eye from
Another girl finals order get them/get extension.

The lesson, always: girls way grosser dudes think. school already required us get annual flu shot time college Damn. auto correct, right? people masks places required idiots plain simple. parts Florida major cities sources says won’t done vaccinating 2023? Pulling words ass isn’t reliable source.

Do driver’s license/ID? Social security number? Live road doesn’t connect public roads? go public school?

A bunch idiots equal lack support, there’s selfish assholes ever would rather quote bullshit actually listen facts decent human being. couple kids health problems large family, daughter newborn. I'd like see schoolage bunch vaccinated too. 2 3 kids cope virtual school ok far, one hard time it. one longing meet new friends. exactly ultimately decision end mask mandates political decision public health one. basically conceivable activity masking safer masking, prevention disease spread society’s primary objective, would never take masks off. We’re going stop wearing masks don’t like social reasons, right we’re kind haggling acceptable number deaths want allow exchange walking around faces showing.

From Fauci’s point view, soon tells vaccinated people burn masks, he’s sentencing number people death, particularly discourage continued masking among unvaccinated. Fauci’s goal different voters politicians they’ve elected — Fauci’s goal 2019-normal, views public health cesspool wholly insufficient disease awareness. Fauci’s goal use pandemic create post-2021 new normal people generally aware disease spread. Fauci et al would recommended universal mask-wearing every past flu season hadn’t known they’d laughed room. they’re thinking maybe get people wear mask every flu season forever. Fauci said he’d like permanently get rid handshakes! That’s he’s coming from.

Since Fauci personally nightclubs concert venues, economic social implications permanent capacity restrictions little consequence him. elect politicians balance public health concerns concerns. That’s we’re going get rid masks. Fauci declares every virus eradicated, maybe keep wearing masks two months make sure new viruses emerging. looking forward battle trying get appointment  One biggest fears contracting virus vaccine becoming readily available everyone. year precaution contract end game would awful. 

Granted, 8-12 weeks we'll able assume virtually all\* hospitalization cases anti-vaxxers. point.

\*This obviously ignores children immunocompromised people cannot receive vaccines. point 2-3 months vast majority people hospitalized opted get vaccinated. Americans become cocky vaccines still massively short herd immunity top ignored pleas federal health officials ease restrictions quickly went ahead anyway. going rough months real eye opener lot people here. Osterholm says B117 variant mostly blame recent spike cases early evidence shows children may likely spread B117 virus least 70% 100% infectious least 50% 60% likely cause severe disease. issue really challenge it’s spreading readily young kids seen COVID viruses prior B117,” Dr. Osterholm says.
According British Medical Journal, happening Italy Israel months Israel, experts believe variant first emerged month later, January, British Medical Journal says 50,000 kids tested positive virus, month 1st 2nd wave Italy, researchers studied spike cases small village 10% population caught individuals children, spread virus family members positive week Pfizer reported vaccine 100% efficacy kids ages 12 goes planned, vaccine 12 15 year olds could ready soon start next school year,” says Dr. Bill Gruber, Pfizer’s Senior Vice President Vaccine Clinical Research kids possibly months away eligible experts say kids may likely spread new variant, know yet causing serious reactions children.
Either way, they're encouraging families keep masks social distancing heading summer, next school year, kids start classroom hopefully never leave. **D P A** can’t list occupation actually going beyond explanation would put risk recognition. 

Am going protesting? No. I’m writing representatives urging open vaccines readily available public. also visiting places mask requirements, hosting large group get togethers celebrate.

I honestly don’t care seeing “me fit”. opinion entirely worthless me. reason responding it’s going hopefully convince others reading point view hopefully urging representatives open well. 

There stark difference people choosing lines either side now. want go back normal fulfilling social moral ethical obligations vaccinated, others comfortable going back normal want impose moral ideology others fear. that’s fine. Sometimes things don’t work, vaccine program would bargain 100-times price given level success failure. 0.05% basically enough political leadership nobody else.

They thing food, security, basically every resource. party leadership gets theirs, fuck everyone else. brand skepticism seems like excuse lazy research required answer ones questions. They're still trying figure get second catheter deliver Solarcaine couple days later. Yep! quarantine let even friend gets it, skip quarantine. Plus, travel easier. We’re giving away, diplomatic brownie points worth could ever ask for. ........ problem. People around world faking negative covid test reports well, big problem given massive resistance even acknowledging pandemic exists. mentality scares hell fuck wrong people lately Nope, vaccines available. Agreed. I’m reading correctly, US Government added $628M Emergent contract vaccine development prioritized vaccine work Defense Production Act. True government provides two numbers: “calculated” number “reported” number. Bloomberg seems closer reported number (1.9 million doses) Nobody screw pandemic response Trump ... 

Doug Ford: ""Hold beer."" Absolutely short term effects seem well documented comparatively safe. Long term effects seem likely safe too, there's lot data there. 

I'm commenting there's lot well earned skepticism government agencies pharmaceutical companies. I'm surprised there's reluctance resistance guidelines. There's millions people alive remember Thalidomide “miracle drug” caused deformed newborns. kind skepticism lingers (I imagine)

I'm still getting vaccine, sympathy people reluctant get new vaccine. sympathy get old, proven vaccines. heard ventilators since probably mid last year. Interesting thing Ukraine mostly oxygen concentrators ventilators. Hospitals kick people saturation 85% go find oxygen concentrator die home guess, fully recover. big non-profit rents oxygen concentrators free. heard word oxygen concentrators use US though. hasn’t approved FDA AZ hasn’t applied authorization. It’s already approved reputable regulators, excellent vaccine. solely function vaccination regimens. hit UK government adding country England's coronavirus travel ""red strongly-worded statement posted Twitter, Kenya's ministry foreign affairs used move warn ""vaccine apartheid"" nations produce ""hoarding"" jabs, rest world. Or, kids largest group without anti-bodies it’s natural that’s spread now. Many older adults vaccinated and/or already caught it. plus I’m sure you’d rather sick miss school activity. get got downvoted, true, mutated variants potentially escape immune responses become resistant. Way many users who'd rather live ignorance learn viruses mutate. Yeah, doesn’t say said. There’s lot reasons company might able supply poor companies, including infrastructure, willingness expend efforts so, and, big focus article, risk U.S. exporting vaccines. major cities Florida locked enacted protocols like mask mandates. governor never ordered statewide lockdown doesn’t mean cities didn’t take steps own. Covid bigger impact fertility vaccine. Yeah this. thought gonna get good aid ended paying fulk price middle class student sister (a doctor) parents already fully vaccinated there's u want karma need join hive mind.

We forced get vaccinated want eat, drink, use public restroom we're killing grandma's we're selfish evil antivax cult terrorists. agree. freedom killing us. *Future historians going know we're assholes People understand huge eligibility groups equal vaccinating more. Mass. focusing getting vaccination grades high quickly possible people need greatest chance ending hospital.

Opening now, means 58 year old might compete spot healthy teen. 6th US, clearly slowing down.

It smart thing long slow significantly. does, open up. normal rules US usually allow vaccines made facility avoid issue happened. Due pandemic relaxed rule. issue happened human error telling plant prioritize vaccine already approved. 

This makes complete logical sense seems like big deal. Merck’s proposal circulated, scientists including Profs. Gilbert Hill closed ranks it, part concerns whether Merck could supply poor countries, according people familiar discussions. say Prof. Hill, Jenner Institute director, told colleagues he’d fight deal wouldn’t promise affordable global vaccine supply. Europe one tweet think underestimating much removing AZ access 60s would affect vaccine rollout. large majority 60s already received first dose. Also, AZ accounts least 2/3 UK's first doses. Like not, relying heavily able give AZ young people.

Since vaccine provides 100% protection, need reach full herd immunity fast possible save group vulnerable people protected virus. Even small additional delay (and suggestion would large additional delay) would cost significant number lives. Let in!!!! According website, tuition 2025 around 90k/year. Scary.... guy ? new chairman communist soviet party. Pfizer says one week 2nd dose. CDC says people don’t get confused, since Moderna two weeks. 

People whatever feel comfortable with. feel comfortable amount protection I’m getting one week (over 90%), that’s I’m doing. link dead Parents much. Cults thing. hasn’t. vast vast majority transmission happens indoors. two kids 12-15 range. worried well catch covid they're healthy complications rare.

I get vaccine soon trust science want part protect others. Virtual schooling also awful even we're drop, would anything get keep school open. anything avoid losing long-term (or *permanently*) crippling one senses, that’s exactly happens pretty good amount COVID cases *any* age.

My healthy 21 year old co-worker running 102–104 degree fever four days straight can’t smell taste properly four weeks later. Netherlands export rules, Texas cannot unbelievable stupid comments are.

It's 7 18.5+ million

Hey guys, That's 0.00003889% chance. want count women, still 0.0000something. 

Stop fear mongering vaccines. sign classes freshman year ""I tetanus shot"". Well idiots school lost fax (this conveniently break nobody contacted us). Put behind whole year. predict many based log fit trajectory (e.g. #/time) totally vaccinated. log fit? population puts upper bound total number possible one expects log fit trajectory data. underlying math different predicting long take ball drop long take bacteria use food petri dish. (Different equations/fits though). first three questions asked nothing anything unrelated anything said. want us remove masks mandates eventually weighing scientific evidence, mental health concerns, economic concerns reality human behavior. reality people going much longer, especially vaccine. point made mask mandates okay “feelings.” reasonable people would disagree you. data available government site, plain sight correct different ones different. Many different estimates 80-90 pretty accepted best guess medical community right covid better data. Could more. Could less. 

I care kids get less approved, still people spreaders included percentage needed reach herd immunity. it? Yes EU single market, countries still autonomy. single market mean countries can't rules decisions  bit sore arm Pfizer dose 1. mild, flu shot gave soreness fall Funny, that's **the head CDC** said last week. I'd love see source stating long covid effecting 10-30% infections Hopefully, it’s already approved 16+ least older teens covered. released study data said covid cases vaccinated group 12-15 year olds compared 18 non vaccinated group. Small study said saw even higher amount protection kids aged compared adults. begins? Ok I’ll check information fact Reuters actually updated article accurate headline hour ago shows realized headline misleading. New headline: ‘U.S. puts J&amp;J charge plant botched COVID vaccine, removes AstraZeneca’. stickers though, shit UNHACKABLE!  unvaccinated people aren’t getting let in... Fake New Fallacy familiar pattern sudden surge one relatively small area country (the NYC metro, Arizona, Dakotas first, second, third waves respectively) leading indicator incoming surge spreads regionally ultimately nationally. Perhaps without vaccine available situation Michigan really would indicate widespread fourth wave would soon hit. 

But completely agree situation entirely different many people already immune vaccinations expanding number quickly. lot theses (thesises?) cooking right moment maybe public health officials lie. aren’t long way herd immunity. doesn’t “need x%”. Different viruses different percentages. 

The amount people already amount people already vaccinated massive number right now. 

Children cannot vaccinated yet. isnt approved them. 

Also, children get covid severity rates adults. also don’t spread like adults. baffled people first. science friend. get vaccinated. Ok let’s take simply taxing tender brain- part headline click bait? “? Simply point don’t afraid! I’d trust UK honor obligations, Americans. glass blocks large amount UV. Regular eyeglasses prevent sunburn eyes (especially snowblindness). I’m telling businesses do, I’m implementing within state run agencies, coercing private business loss state funding, incentives/credits businesses comply. 

The people don’t trust vaccine issue vaccines passport cards, cards create new type second class citizen anyone young healthy gotten vaccine yet. Also playing devils advocate here, we’re talking typical round vaccines required attend school. first kind vaccine isn’t FDA approved yet. shouldn’t talking COVID vaccines required anything fully approved everyone opportunity get one. problem many elected officials, rather actually leaders, either hiding behind CDC avoid accountability, completely ignoring altogether. Same. Keep fighting good fight call representatives reopen everyone access. Many places seem Netherlands’ number wrong. Probably availability data itself. Hopefully companies see economic gains rent much office space. Money speaks, crank profit margins leasing 1/2 space, gotta figure C level grubber going go it. stop Wow millionaire got second dose vaccine😱😱🤭🤭 Super safe. surprising. mood worsened pandemic; anything improved bit bother coming excuses ""social distancing"" I've done whole life. 4.5MM 3/13? Cool. Vaccines still work Cause still spread kids unvaccinated many months. [The contagious P1 variant Brazil invaded Canada People annoying seem like productive person. amazing. introvert, mood actually improved quite bit. think it’s first time, don’t feel bad going people. don’t feel guilty like I’m living life wrong. 

Not drag social obligations allowed take time need home refresh, connect work projects. feel closer ever. 

My concern I’m going get used this, I’m going return forcing go ends.  countries Covid-19, people already wear masks cold flu. Im reporting misleading title. It’s even title article bar that? Like No. Next. Post history indicates lives mining farming community rural Georgia. sub gone shit. filled absolutely filled anti-science morons pushing completely stupid Facebook ideologies even directly confronted evidence contrary. Well yeah, going open border we've vaccinated everyone can. Mass vaccinations set begin July cover adults December. hopefully open back January 2022. Fauci said would 4th

He literally said opposite. okay, keep making stuff up. “Because vaccinated” reason case numbers low right now. Case numbers going speak, quite opposite said. delusional world, seem ok ignoring amount people still unvaccinated carelessly acting like that’s enough cause large spike cases. Nobody’s suggesting boosters every 4-6 months Might family/guests Easter careful?

To sounds like type careful neighbors around. =) Personally, Yes do, least could try achieve goal. sure better letting spreading. mutating fast vaccinate quickly. live next decade receiving boosters shoots every 4-6 months.  I'd stick guidance CDC gives stick original 2 doses. studies linked done much control vaccine studies done prove efficacy. 

It almost sounds like purposely searching articles confirm skip second dose. =) Zero COVID ... US, hold beer Thanks Bromainan brochacho! Oh no. stopped world super powers depopulating planet one attack. /s pleasure see USA led properly again. number deaths (so far) difficult comprehend. Reminder everyone RES lets tag users whatever want multiple color options. Tone deaf spot description. Got mine today! Anti vaxxers think war """"""""""them"""""""""" current level distribution would take less 2 weeks give every Canadian first shot.  don’t disagree, others mentioned, buildings could absorb kind employee loss provide basic care residents. saying that's true all, choice felt liberating since feel pressure everyone else is. foreigner living US, really get soooo maaaany different healthcare systems US. confusing, bet lot money gets lost int way. read released CDC study? Ok number hard wear mask? sure. Listen Fauci. subreddit trusted year think suddenly know saying? we're sure overkill always good approach. Source highest transmission presymptomatic ? see username lot, troll? Yes you’re overdoing it. It’s nice waking every day last year knowing won’t obligated socialize folks whose company don’t enjoy sharing. It’s quite freeing. lol no. shut completely. Seems like trouble worth they're scared running 2024 since he's one Republican united factions party. typical annual flu. 
/s dense amongst us still expect huge cries “what mah freedom?!” excess death? keep saying never defined Unpopular opinion private institutions able whatever tf want Thanks showing true colors. Surprised anyone takes seriously. upvotes fellow teenagers bots. I've gotten 17 tests. Always precaution. never thought sick coronavirus wfh i've cautious, wanted see friends, travel, etc. Always made sure quarantine get test beforehand. We've known coronavirus take around 5 days average show symptoms I've always tested.

Mass testing &amp; contact-tracing really key containing pandemic. Telling everyone stay home see people indefinite period time NEVER work.

I followed science made sure take precautions get tested frequently. US, vaccine covered federal government. Even pharmacies making buck administrating shots. exchange student money get shot Us gotta convince lipid layer coating mRNA vaccines *basically* oil Compared normalcy. Canadian government joke dealing COVID. 6000 new cases Ontario last two days. worse US right since much slower vaccine rollout. middle schools opening everything else shut down. Thanks clarification cult followers

How answering question equate one ""cult follower""? Aren’t Canadians Mexicans coming vaccines? know fact Mexicans are... bad Brazilian variant escapes vaccine borders exactly closed tons Brazilian varient Canada hate that, extrovert, shamed feeling shitty lonely sad love around people crowds. Sometimes go grocery store see peoples faces. It’s depressing af Lol lockdowns slow countries vaccinate say! fake rumors virus...i imagine happened alot covid. comparing incidence BP group time frame \~4 months (the vaccine recipients) incidence BP gen pop time frame 12 months, math clear-cut make be. overall incidence rate still love vaccine trials, something keep eye on. It’s pronounced CORNELL it’s highest rank Ivy League I'd like throw mine away I'm vaccinated, I'm sure deal going businesses ending youtube dare put mask still found way say fuck djt Maybe. point I’m making expect somebody sue. “Don’t add discussion” Hero seems hospitalizations deaths back going down, time being. Hopefully cases follow suit, eventually. Duh. know that. Try telling dumb fucks didn’t wear masks 2020. Fuck DJT fuck supporters didn’t wear masks. *useful* third arm? like withered nub Thank info. oblivious honestly. fauci says whatever people want hear. anything science. Whatever keep spotlight longest time. one shot fame exploited  many businesses would required anyways?

If time frame going back normal keeps getting moved up, might even consider them.  year arguably serious non pharmaceutical interventions. yeah, NBD Lmao. private business allowed blatantly racist policies keeping people loose shirts Timberland boots, surely choose exclude morons vaccinate deadly disease. 


No way holds up. Hey 👋 :) mean....it's probably failing people people fit tested really make sure they're getting protection N95 supposed give you, wearing wrong size. Also, men can't get good seal facial hair. fine, arm soreness far universal question light bleeding injection. Good luck US release hoarded AstraZeneca Vaccine, need likely even use it. article.  


""**The data differentiate variants, though instances Ontario right thought B117 variant first identified southeast England.""** 


Jump conclusions much.  


You minor changes viral fitness cause one particular variant Virus become dominate. 
Epically spreads.  
 thought 20% cases responsible 80% spread. slightly improved affinity ace2 would mean major differences effect us course several generations virus one variant compete another. need perform better 20% cases result high transmission.  


We seen way lager death rates original virus last year. 
We seen much higher countries including neighbors south.  
All problems caused original SARS-COV-2 


Every one getting fatigued that's helping cases creep up. Schools matter wish it, major source transmission massively testing schools.  
 testing plateaued 6 months probably missing way cases think. Part point testing isloate trace cut transmission early keep growth down. basically given part pandemic control. that's keep cases down. TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST.  
But yes keep blaming minor changes viral fitness. Got 1st shot 55 hours ago. side effects whatsoever except sore arm. safely say 55 hours arm back 100%. Feeling great! thought embellishing googled myself. Holy smokes. can't believe many died. yeah existed throughout history pac12 fan Im hyped UCLA  Good luck friend! Moderna working booster Variants Pfizer saying current model works it. clearly difference? here! rolled local Walgreens got stabbed. Well yeah, crime lol. be. Yep, thinking checking numbers. Yes, we're going up, need worry another december/janurary surge we're vaccinated. Meanwhile, european countries announced new lockdowns. Compare figures reported last week see 50% drop sunday figures....amazingly people ignore want bigger numbers reason. testing extremely limited New York's wave. Deaths limited testing they're relevant. Goddamn GoT really suck fat one end.... J&amp;J vaccines means reach herd immunity faster. NC AG Josh Stein along 44 Attorneys General sends letters CEOs Twitter, eBay, AG's signed letter: Attorney General Stein Attorney General Slatery joined sending letter Attorneys General Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Guam, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Virgin Islands, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming Negative ok matters sadly check back last weekend see figures double reported today..... Same. think love anonymity places &amp; crowds people don’t know. like enjoy life around people , terms. partner friend accompanies , negotiate everything. people dying affected limited testing start pandemic. People talk trash like ball sports since like combat sports, hit ""at least sports application real life, throwing football save jumped"" Apply covid-19 spike? people would stop hardly anything flu season even vaccinated flu.

throw social aspect though personally knowing someone died flu (aka COVID) suddenly changes. (speaking OPs specific question)

people personal experience someone hospital dying COVID likely lower risk tolerance someone know anyone bad experience COVID. vaccines work variants. saying, “masks 2022 variants create new wave” nothing fearmongering BS, it’s much simpler tell people vaccinations work variants back normal soon people vaccinate. Simple. wonder pharmacist duty time? yes give celebs hard time anymore using platform  seemed struggling find ways useful.

Pandemics yet Change presidents changed lot Americans 1 3 employees need fired. university also *requiring* vaccine though? Last year reality pandemic became apparent (I believe news reported shut Wuhan, city millions) wave anxiety overcame me. literally frightening thing ever experienced, describe feeling existential dread sweeping me. severe anxiety whole month episodes high heart rate. One morning got bed, stood fairly quickly passed out.

Doctors find anything wrong doctor thinks something combination anxiety issues standing quickly.

Thank correcting me. well. places pulling back restrictions also static falling cases. vaccinations literally hitting records almost every day, 3 million 7 day average. 

So keep wrong, guess. seems hoping for, even meet reality. Sigh...no I’m saying that, I’m saying continue requiring masks. I’m saying, *if* private business feels compelled require masks wants vaccine passports it’s them. 

There’s much dialogue “we open! Let businesses decide” businesses want restrict serve, that’s all. 

If Target wants require vaxx passport shop there, that’s targets ELT’s choice based fiduciary responsibility Target stock holders, full stop. masks worsened mental health actually lockdown itself. locked nightlife concerts stuff sucks too, masks absolutely unbrarable me. spend **decade** effort hope appearance self improvement now, got goal, cover face time leave thr house. vaccine supply.

That leaves Canada get vaccines Europe, also resisting exports, India. Bruh still like 600k deaths still getting 1k deaths rn. It’s going it’s right time talk shit. See, adding extremist thinking worry. “Forever?” That’s even worth thinking about. Let’s get near term.

If need changes forever, much bigger problem hands. ELE stuff. Speaks type person OP it? Thanks bro! see type ""Fauci/health officials tone deaf"" narrative sub lately health officials taking measured, cautioned approaches. job say things make tired pandemic happy. would rather do? Lol one third adult population nowhere near enough stop spread virus. Estimates herd immunity 70% total population. spreads fastest dorms however, rumors Hold strong. Hopefully Novavax gets approved soon frees beaucoup supply Canada. thanks, thought first comment would blame luddite heard “It’s flu.” Constantly live.

Although I’m fully vaccinated, almost month, I’ve lost desire go out.. Snapchat, see everyone partying, without masks. It’s like, live world here? everything “normal” you’re vaccinated? I’m tired. don’t even feel like used be, know? think it’s rich people thing. Okay, guess makes sense.

I've definitely vision go dark standing suddenly—actually regular occurrence years happened recently—however never got point passing like roommate did. Florida overtaken Buffalo rank ""armpit America"" Many schools require meningococcal vaccines students well. Businesses keep mitigating COVID spread masks, need vaccine passports.

It sounds like already prepping move goalposts ""oh required masks vaccine passports, super spreader COVID denier! Start requiring vaccine passports!"" Can't suffer mood decline mood always low. Ugh, got pneumonia fucking dorms. flu months later, right time finals week! Glad hear! Welcome club It’s easier control borders aren’t land borders. someone far Tuskegee, they've emphasized PSAs treatment withheld Tuskegee experiment. opposite. enrolled grad school cared measles. Possibly western Washington facing low-level outbreaks time.

My mom’s hand-written card early 80’s good enough. news, water wet. thought Jews don’t believe Jesus messiah? celebrate Easter? number apparently unsourced affected batch might sliver 15 million already produced. Sounds like perfect time let guard down! they’ve locked year assume want socialize constantly? gonna say that. bots. mean, anyone file lawsuit anything, I'm curious, grounds lawsuit filed? Pfizer FDA approved fall, safely assume. That's adapted Zoom bearable.  video end, comments needed. Mine wouldn’t drop 100.4 24 hours. 101.1, one reading 102. 

Everyone different, sadly. I’d still again. They'd lose pretty easily. Probably implying known history health issues. Dont know downvoted. Simple math using total deaths Irf shows 30% Manaus infected. hilarious came 70% single place world many infections. Duh?   keep quite they're going contradict themselves.

You fly, shouldn't.

""Impending doom"" variants, see surge.

You spread virus vaccinated, keep wearing masks distance others. Getting Vax Monday! 

RemindMe! 16 days time get careless jump two nine cases second dose odd! misinterpreting that? mean university made take Hepatitis shots updated. required even taken it. get shots summer school clear enrollment. weird crowds making bit controversial big news. know tons schools require certain shots people take move on. Right? Seems like people complaining extroverts. I’m convinced hesitancy corporations move work home promotion extroverts management can’t function without seeing people person. Vaccines probably least one order magnitude effective masks. would put masking within rounding error population immunity. WTH talking about? me. social pressure

If one without mask, get ""stares"" least. Employees larger stores likely ask put mask on. (Of course works vast majority wearing masks already case live)

And works reverse too: majority wearing masks, strong pressure rest stop wearing.

A. mask marks either scared weak sick

B. given fabric masks mostly protecting ""others"" (with much weaker protection wearer), would care protect others same? (Especially, low-risk group) sub loves conveniently ignore Vietnam sake ""but island"" argument I’m introverted homebody. March 2020, job close weren’t allowed back two months. best time life. live alone. whatever wanted, wanted. would sleep day, play video games, read, whatever. never leave apartment unless to, stocked groceries didn’t leave two week periods time. Even then, grocery car pickup getting delivery. online friends remarked happiest I’d ever sounded. I’m usually stressed work depressed, much better staying away people place. two months, job forced everyone come back. live shitty state wanted try open everything much soon possible. Since returning, I’ve asshole. stupid people rules work bother become intolerable. started snapping coworkers something stupid, boss comes work everyday new Covid conspiracy theory. It’s like...why put shit? It’s dumb hell. one wants it. accept jobs hate that’s do. feel like I’m wasting life. hate feel drained get home don’t want anything, don’t anything enjoy. days spent sleeping day energize chores prepare go back work. life wasted. I’m miserable. pray outcome. I’m moving thing. Geography certainly plays role. relatively isolated, fewer international travelers, and, yes, better tracking also helps. Yes. People don’t want wear going trouble getting mRNA vaccine arm. It’s like putting ductape vault door doesn’t anything point already safe COVID ever vaccinated Wait people private business owner? It’s pronounced colonel. It’s highest rank military. got downvoted hell essentially saying thing couple months ago everyone proclaiming going back normal. Yeah want word Americans. Didn't. extrovert honestly mood improved Yay!! one them, too! #AMC business. fine. Why? didn’t spend every penny times good. Maybe business done same. mean true jealous US rollout

Is even true lmao goalpost movers union called - want keep up! private entities may house families unable get vaccine even wanted one.. option restricting access private business protect themselves.

Why people favor allowing entities people reveal carry firearms? 

This revealing information.. medical records.. bp blood results.. vaccinated.. shit kids present attend grade school. heard estimate high (and I'm trying fight -- surprised). Im getting first shot Tuesday. huge relief, think we're going lose many people unnecessarily get control. I've first Moderna shot, arm started get sore 6 hours later, woke fever/sweating 11 hours after, muscle aches, minor headache, fatigue 30 hours after. fine. Can't wait second dose lol since everyone says ones worse. see ludicrous display last night? it? think it’s part it, it’s certainly multiple factors they’re crying governments completely botched vaccination programs shitting us bailing out. australia - done well better. like public schools

This ingrained authoritarianism mind frame. see absolutely everything framework government authority, point called government institution private entity don’t see it. WTF island it? think people sneaking across borders spread covid? ridiculous trope still us? feel like poor job explaining it. 75, course supposed get vaccine. news? I'm genuinely confused. Wait guys haven’t able get haircut whole time? Yeah there’s pretty much nothing middle, unlike USA There’s definitely simple precautions like plexiglass dividers could used flu season without greatly inconveniencing anyone. We’re also long past due labor laws make easier stay home sick.  effective masks actually?

If CDC right saying vaccines 90% effective covid spread, better masks offer protection wise, protected would wearing mask vaccinated? australia size USA. Back geography class you! mention potential long term health effects “mild moderate” covid. course going regional extent. That's brainer. wish bigger demand I'm located. 16 year old pet sits got last week, good bad. Good vaccinated. Bad issues making appointment within day. foresee border opening near future conditions like proof negative test vaccination? Got second dose Pfizer today! ah yes, island nation Vietnam tiny population 96million people. I'm fine kids talk much Vancouver Canuck player OG Covid, sick Brazil wearing piece cloth face big deal people?

Yes. :

A. outright depressing

B. mask gets wet ~20 min soon gets *sticky*

C. glasses pose extra problem, wasnot yet able fit surgical mask avoid fogging.

It's still smaller deal getting (or spreading) covid that's saying much.. Seriously? need get one liked actually. Speak lot acquaintances once, you’re done social engagements 45 minutes. Versus real life see 1-3 people time, need allocate lot time per week (I’m older massive parties don’t happen much old circle). already equivalent vaccine passports everything. need certain vaccinations travel, job, go school. would another vaccine add good news continue contact tracing lockdowns rest world kicks this. ... uh... did... actually read source? cherry pick one line could misinterpreted mean want mean?

Because source proves wrong right. 

Let's finish rest quote cherry picked, shall hopefully, want make metaphorical race, vaccine going win one. believe will, continue vaccine program, really quite successful, time prematurely declare victory pull back much mitigation policy.

So thanks winning argument me. introvert, confirm good. lmao what

im conservative calm I'm one introverted people suffered mood decline pandemic. No...it's joke. continue kill people. 

But....if think it...we crazy run 50 years terms contagious disease lack death.


For sum human history, something always deal with. 

I guess back while.  Yep. know feeling. It’s hard things difficult long, instant everything became somehow manageable once.

Now seems enter new phase. Unfortunately fortunately (depending opinion) reimagined normal likely similar phase people like us found challenging less like one thrived in. 

I plan keep much 2020 lifestyle moving forward it’s made things much better personally. wants us know STAY. Probably due strain hospital system lot elective surgeries missed cancer screening would usually detected cancer earlier. Thus expect elevated deaths next couple years. later said everybody able vaccine april. scoffed too.

Yet :) introverted better prepares us it.

Also introverts use lot mental energy social interactions. well anyone, reserve needs refilled, doesn’t happen you’re work example. work, put “the face” day, come back exhausted. covid, work perhaps put face hour day coworkers could select actually wanted speak to. Ahh, thank context! now.. symptoms lasted almost exactly 24 hours currently feel “normal”. bit tired shitty sleep that’s really vaccine issue. Hopefully that’s wrap! point pretty obvious bots work, least partially. I’ve wondering this. I’m 35. 2 kids. me, wearing mask couple months (or kids also vaccinated) seems like nothing. I’m older. 20 year old missed year life, well, it’s percentage life. Also many people 20’s stupid. was. able be. Unfortunately, many haven’t able to, they’re done. they’re going use whatever “excuse,” try make behavior ok, actually, group seems highest infected right now. think that’s happened sub. don’t blame teens 20 year olds pissed fucking tired it. blatantly ignoring science we’ve come understand year prolong things. Lol, could called. I'd tell last year felt great judged leaving house once. Yeah experience same. say explain people chill that's it. try twist arm back assert yourself. need excuses going feeling resentful it.

Jobs harder also doable, people hate work environment need look elsewhere one suits them. easy? No. worth it? Absolutely. Complaining extroverts fruitless endeavor changes nothing. Yup! cdc guidelines safe bet states. Removes responsibilty making distribution decisions, CDC says 20 year old pre existing goes healthy 50-64 year old. That’s awesome! Congratulations. hope it’s spectacular! consider introverted, months happy. telecommuting, deal coworkers, dress work, sit stupid meetings pretend interested, etc.

But couple months alone turned 6 months, year. point fell depression, gotten steadily worse. went finding interaction people slightly annoying, craving horribly frightened it. 

I'm stuck paradoxical loneliness. gotten vaccinated could technically go rejoin society. mere thought makes sick stomach, thought never interacting anyone makes like weight pressing top me. 16 days I’m even eligible. Don’t take granted. Yea, I’m 95% sure Sanofi/GSK actually took largest stake OWS flamed ($2.1 Billion viral vector provide adequate protection). also billion dollar order AZ likely amount nothing. happy helping people get vaccinated Colorado! Go it. That's republican thing.. government keeps thier hands off... .. heyyyy.. wait minute!? wonder states are? far notice states following CDC guidelines.. expanding enough demand ages. Same!! Congrats us! 🎉 CDC already say Vaccines great job defending spread covid, 90% reduction spread seems like probably lot higher effectiveness mask? vaccines replacement masks fact prevent covid transmission masks do? super jealous you. Please let you. Time get another job. hope Betty White got vaccinated too! unlikely. canadian working US pharmaceutical industry, brain drain real. salary something tune 50% cross border. canada needs pay competitively Glad give laugh 😆 type shit people take gospel. Knowridge.com zero information even click link. That's even getting possibility animal reservoirs re-introduce I’ve already noticed awkwardness brief encounters mailman neighbors. Like responses downright embarrassing come back inside thinking hell say lol Interesting, think people like tell frail, on-death's-door people die situations. Go go go US share vaccines countries. conspiracy theories more. conspiracy fantasies. Exactly. mother taken vaccine. I’m going take vaccine. 

But isn’t vaccine that’s around years. isn’t CDC trusted. 

Also - happened final say body? Jesus Christ. People losing damn minds. get vaccine Canada means 2nd shot going delayed 4 months. would want ovhe Canadian right now. Don’t understand you’re downvoted...what’s sub? hour isn’t bad- people driving over. I’m SoCal Mexicans driving here. Canadians also crossing border. talking about? course pretty much one likes masks. don’t need argue anyone that.

My point wearing *public* another month two. really hard (honest question)?

These past 12 months terrible zero issues wearing mask grocery store store little longer *we* squash covid, even though *I’m* vaccinated. China's population population density magnitudes higher Australia 

Beijing alone almost population entire Australian continent Honestly vaccines required long time, EUA ones not. That’s main issue that. opinion it’s fully approved, go it. 

I also really despise “it’s business anything want” can’t, indentured servitude doesn’t exist. That’s used comparison. going insane like July :) governor florida would like word. (He’s issued executive order prohibiting requiring vaccine.) Florida!!! Dolly natural treasure. vaccine. wife. 

People think reason get wrong people say reason get it. 

If I’m honest, many reasons distrust government past year. Many people didn’t need reasons think leadership squandered good faith lying moving goal posts constantly. CDC mess. 

I friends directly work CDC horrible leadership.

WHO garbage year well. Many people never trust again. 

There plenty reasons tog vaccine. can’t even conversation it, trust anyone? Every college university know require vaccination records attend college residentially. Even crazy conservative college required list vaccines, didn’t proof record couldn’t live go school campus. felt relief 1st. wonderful. devils advocate, might need close two weeks. would take frequent small shipments. Right 100 week. One box moderna week getting two boxes time. typical one pharmacist staffed store. Also frequent, small shipments expensive packing materials isn’t ideal us Pfizer. goal post moves yet Yes, made good call. believe 100% people want vaccinated taking appointments anyone reservation now.

In America, last year certainly proved many citizens thought one - hence tribe made decision. Yes. actually like remote game nights pjs! Ok, thing:

I sure original commenter, even people like social anxiety introverted see kinda social interactions. Like yeah, got friends, know want chance maybe make least retain acquaintances stuff I, like probably people like me, still kinda seek social stuff that. maybe want talk everyone time (but still make sure bit), still might seek ways help something (like putting away dishes whatever makes sense), still net positive people.

Please let enjoy bit time feel people retiliate much declining invitation, especially makes sense now. Fred Rogers, Bob Ross, Dolly Parton, Steve Irwin

Mt Rushmore Wholesomeness doare pula, curve indobitocite speriate. best part worrying hug people.  hate people say "" hugger"" hug you, like makes ok.  stressful me. avoid parties. live alone. Yesterday one guys maintenance apartment building commented fact I’d lost weight. realized last time I’d seen anyone know personally Christmas parents. Three months ago. appreciated noticed, even introvert arguably thrived quarantine thought bit jarring basically don’t see anyone really know anymore. Crazy times. I'm surprised think ban businesses requiring masks. state sunny could really excelling covid charts. didn’t say “more children dying” I? reports show children &amp; young people leading latest surge. kids infected result kids getting seriously ill sheer #’s. 

I seen PLENTY people don’t seem concerned kids getting virus. It’s new virus! avoid it? family get flu shots year lessen possible impact flu, I’d rather kids get either. here! Like 99.8 fever goes up. take Tylenol migraine pill trying take another Tylenol. Mostly sore it’s better. heard tomorrow better day. Mine comes goes things getting mire mild. Damn back pain tho. High five friend! got this!! I'm convinced states barrier yet. I've heard people states certain areas using supplies, there's still high demand cities maybe it'll take redirecting supplies within states. sounds like another barrier might administration infrastructure states (I've heard people MS/AL). said, agree overall, 69.420% going hard hit vaccinate children. 60% much reasonable target, since that's 80% adults. think intriverts less noticeable, extroverts difficult avoid  sorry can't really find much terms graphs. saw analysis cannot find source again. check, region lot P1 'Umbria'. ones advertising are. sold anti viral feature. one going put graphene mask reason. First doses different total doses administered widely available next month, let alone August come states earlier. Herd immunity nothing. 20% vaccinated, spread COVID-19 still slows down. OMG would hope so- woman national treasure university wanted keep on-site anybody find vaccination summer, absolutely could. Cornell abundance research facilities. They've got plenty -80 freezers already; concern would potentially clearing space. Yeah curfews german cities here. 
In city also expect happen next days... walking back making policy 0.01% losing people. 

People refused vaccinated people stop wearing mask. point “experts” come terms pandemic gonna end never gonna end humanity. 

I’m tired seeing maskless people store it’s gonna get worse Thais messaging. That's vaccine certificates name, birth date whether vaccinated it. medical records needed, bare minimum info whether vaccinated. Furries mom's ottoman. That's what's weird virus... There's many places full open dgaf pandemic they're fine places like Michigan getting hammered right now. I'll try shorter course load see whether find interesting. seriously. thought one felt way. tf become clickbaity??? used go-to ""neutral"" news agency Seems bit circular though, it? People downvote people assholes, especially groups, simple as. 

Anyway personally suffer party based FOMO, feel awkward know keep avoiding things people notice. constantly make excuses leaving early on...it's quite taxing  like way approaching this. Thanks. time last year similar (mild) underlying conditions: asthma, sinusitis, bad cases bronchitis every winter I’m careful. pretty much asymptotic entire time. felt little achey fever spiked 24 hours, worst it. Also lost sense smell close month. course that’s say symptoms every person, stay quarantined monitor yourself. dad recently came waves him: completely fine first, felt symptoms, felt better again, started feel horribly wiped given monoclonal antibody infusion. yeah, really unpredictable. Yep I’m vaccinated going Miami Beach funded Moderna vaccine, dude. What's wrong you? government tell businesses business with. Florida man horrible socialist. 18-29 age range going explode upcoming weeks states open 16+ ages college requiring attendance fall. Let's go!! came 2020, got canceled, transgender law repealed, right? sure material requires divine intervention mortals access, one way other, I’d hold out. ended missing lantern festival, imagine looking photo, elvish good enough. sample data number (n) statistically large enough 95+ percent certainty model good. probably 20k people need participated study. Yeah, Weill Cornell med school, Upper East Side Manhattan. also got campus Qatar. there's also new tech campus Roosevelt Island NYC. Try even imagine Ivy-league anti-vaxxer tho. surely exist, like wow product finished US. It’s final product. Im sure math makes ~23 million ~38 million 87%. Yes. vaccine supply limited given state proportion population. states higher per capita demand others. 'behind' per se. people want vaccinated. Meanwhile Trudeau regime... know, like illegal require vaccinations basically every school requires attend /s Anyone know throat kills getting J&amp;J? might become part treatment. imagine people can't get vaccine morning outcome used without harm. It’s called herd immunity protects can’t get vaccine legitimate reasons, anti-vax BS. Yeah think everyone get vaccinated cannot forcing people it. really bad idea think us even talking vaccine passports. shouldn't. good know someone goes books, good know may risky. He's scientist CDC scientific institution. fudge numbers make feel good hold hand cause tough day. That's psychiatrists job, theirs. It'd like doctor wishy washy colon cancer, want someone hold hand delicate, want know gonna die due asshole cancer. put way, sure like breathing people's air... seen what's going mouth? Obvi Good Free vaccines*^(with small yearly subscription fee $30,000) It’s still covid it’s partnership like biontech/Pfizer. Must employ technique mom used dad. everyone would choose get take - legitimate reasons person CAN'T vaccinated, herd immunity important. 

Because vaccine ever 100% effective - fact variants, unrestricted community spread, even among unvaccinated people, still threat still prevalent community spread high. 

Because every time virus transmitted one person another, opportunity mutation possibility new, vaccine resistant strain born - unrestricted community spread bad thing. 

Because even chose vaccinated, would still campus health crisis spreading around, would cost school money resources quarantine people actively choosing put classmates, teachers staff risk choosing take readily available vaccine.

Because, ultimately, price participating society sometimes shit want good group. decide that's deal breaker, that's fine, get nuts twisted opportunities participate start narrow. Vaccines lower risk. That's joke. Obviously people drowning plummeting 100 feet onto sandstone like 6 inches water. True I'm leaving late July likely. Plus many old folks country long time get even 70+ That’s one reasons virus spreads easily. Many, especially first days infection, asymptomatic. Every newly infected person creates possibility nasty mutation becomes ever deadly reinfects people Yeah getting pretty bad. 104 sustained 3 hours probably would gone in. weird didn’t feel quite bad 104. Maybe 102, thank concern! doesn’t make sense people vaccinated Interesting way look it. Never thought employer part true. problem! Certain viruses likely spread route compared coronavirus - think norovirus, stomach bug. would possibly true COVID-19 static virus stayed contagion deadliness. mutated strains deadly younger people. Additionally, silent aspect Covid relates permanent damage it. 7/10 people still recovered Covid. permanent damage olfactory nerves. Imagine ever able taste food ever again. can’t measured predicted, exactly needs slowed stopped Maybe germany AZ started 2 months Pfitzer, sickest, oldest likely kick bucket got it? First four attempts destroy proven lies leaders France Germany.....this insignificant amount deaths blood diseases seems stuck even though topmost experts say another lie AZ. sound little paranoid. I've heard, details vaccine manufacturer would appear vaccination passport, vaccine approved EMA would perfectly permissible. includes AstraZeneca, proving popular 60 + community states Berlin North Rhine Wesphalia moment - ever since states allowed 60+ folks without prior invites go ahead book appointment via telephone lines, lines completely jammed eager people looking forward get vaccination. 60+ folks got AstraZeneca week Berlin include German federal president head Robert Koch Institute plus neighbours. hardly think German health minister planning bar folks prospective privileges vaccinated people may enjoy can't see would. expecting about-face? Ok thanks. I'd bet vaccines least starting available Japan. pfizer vaccine afternoon yesterday last night notice ringing ears. really worrisome. thought anti vaxxers bullshit worried aren’t completely BS. anybody else side effect go away? there's bright center truth, they're medium farthest from. tell ya mom give dad respect disproportional request made young people risk little. would fine letting rampant get natural immunity. understand old people not, requesting protect them. 

It's incredibly rude start traveling STILL locking up. take big middle finger patience wait little extra time. draw line? 
1000 deaths year drunk driving OK, 5000 OK? 
seems established society prostitute haggling price one arguments paranoid new yorkers (who want stop anyone ever socializing again) like use ""public transportation"" -- which, sure, maybe? whole western world pretty much doesn’t want wear almost everywhere there’s age limit masks… it’s absurd. sorry situation. Perhaps requirement, mom allow it. Otherwise, guess need attend different university. currently attend university? good attitude, bravo. Yeah, 11 weeks getting first AZ dosage. could summer (depending receive first dosage). Feel like groping around dark? That’s really interesting, idea. Im guessing it’s honoring deals made well advance? Europe get large amount J&amp;J it’s going fantastic. can’t use microchips vaccine see Young people less health risks, still spread virus increasing risk every age group. Even masks social distancing staying inside still lowers virus spread. utilitarian POV, makes sense.

Assuming vaccinated reduces significantly virus spread, vaccinated people outside increase risk people. thing. utilitarian POV, restricting vaccinated people's freedoms make sense. Like many past year, lost job unemployment 8 months. I'm also covid long hauler. that, ever thought one thing, that's Dolly Parton's well being. I'm happiest I've year knowing fully vaccinated. really never thought I'd live see day!  Atm vaccinating weekends seems pointless available vaccines given week (Belgium). apparently next months supply increase significantly they'll start vaccinating weekends well. banish face masks social distancing (fall?), I'm still hopefull semi normal summer. read judging, read concerned. joke: get easy travel Germany, would put ahead lot tourist destinations late summer/autumn 2021, I'll fully vaccinated. Even can't go anywhere, Germany ridiculously beautiful cities e.g. Munich. Death still end covid infections. 

Even long term covid complications also less likely age group, want 20 year old losing draw dealing health complications decades. Weird we’ve told stay inside day year Yes. make much sense try avoid something that's 1000x less likely kill actual disease  better fitting mask help glass fogging, make water condensation issues WORSE (for obvious reasons).

I think people different: 

A. people may exhale different amounts droplets

B. people different metabolic rates would result getting sweaty 

C. finally different conditions (indoors/ourdoors, warm/cold). 

D. different balance physical activity: sitting table, walking, exercising (for mask gets wet even walking) Yep. Much better lose way 20 behind. Happy Easter! :) sub completely overtaken “skeptics” wacky “the world 1984!!!!” “Don’t tread me” types lately catch spread others. Use brain. do, 1 year two weeks ago, beginning journey Covid. Yeah, mean... there's ton improve US, damn we're fast efficient want be. Makes glad once. wonder countries getting vaccines when. Seems like US main manufacturer, they're gonna wait us vaccinated first also infection kids previous Osterholm says B117 variant mostly blame recent spike cases early evidence shows children may likely spread it.  B117 virus least 70% 100% infectious least 50% 60% likely cause severe disease. issue really challenge it’s spreading readily young kids seen COVID viruses prior B117,” Dr. Osterholm says. Ah yes, well luckily enjoy football social settings. There’s way could ever talk seriously though. 

I’ve meaning try martial art time feel like better defend mean, point hardly valid too! could argue zimbabwe first world 0.01% population lives luxury (“”first world””) 99.99% starves!
That may stupid argument, arguing handful aspects (mostly infrastructure stupid electoral college two party system) makes America even partly “””3rd world””” Another thing note AZ it’s effectiveness towards variants, small study February showed [10% efficiency South African variant.

While may case it’s still really important people continue get vaccinated, good news position soon export help countries get vaccines. fauci says „science“ needs dance naked around car shout? 

How going South Dakota , Florida Texas btw? live US maybe different live kids always wear masks, histrionic adults seem harder time something simple. easier understand OP, thx Preventing spread doesn’t get closer end. Vaccinating people thing young kids can't vaccinated 2022. 

Trust me, could get daughter vaxxed right would. approved. probably nuance acknowledging post I've ever seen particular subreddit /r/confidentlyincorrect should! vaccinating record pace there’s point restricting people less grown tired Covid. part whole year, vaccines going back normal. Open schools open bars! Huzzah! One ignorant disrespectful states thinks. mean Whitmer. risk lies consequences lie society. Giving drinking stalled too. developed bad habit brandy old fashioneds pandemic. Considering much goal posts shifted past year, scary know ACTUALLY possible today's climate. people literally fight rights gives even little bit safety. Got 1st Moderna Friday. sore arm (4/10) almost gone today.  missing point. Hahahahaha, I’m laughing 😐 isn’t tit-for-tat relationship elderly people. treating public health is, realistically impacts different populations different majors. don’t know feel need punish others justify suffering. Lockdowns work sociopath. economic solution easy: allow vaccinated people travel easily, pay extra fee, given help pay massive mental health burdens imposed young. 


That way, reduce unfairness vaccinated people keep freedom. true. said true, artists still need another income support themself “social distancing” years prior March 2020 don’t want “normal” narrative makes sense serves detract people getting shot places without shortages.

It's simple. Go state's reservation system. tons appointments, make damn appointment regardless age.

Nevada throwing away doses overly restricted access. Pregnancy preventable. gave everyone birth control pills could licked generation. imagine growing orphan knowing killed mother? want ensure never happens anyone. Really, many.

And let smallpox “run course” definition. Otherwise western civilization would lockdown past 400 years got vaccine. assumption even work, would assume one 100% chance getting Covid. even put 20,000 people immune virus way indoors poorly ventilated space without wearing masks, happen. Yes too, also privacy necessary connect central server piece Paper might kinda less reluctant. 3 million die year US, virtue signalling lockdown fanatic. understands risk level still citing like might anxiety disorder. Understandable, whole thing’s traumatic people. maybe talk therapist, zoom? Ontario here. it’s worth kinda wish province. Essential workers teachers need vax lot considering they’re shutting schools here. understand, Michigan a... special culture. ask people Michigan help understand militia people able threaten governor assault rifles government land. seems strong anti-government militia culture there, I’m surprised people act like virus isn’t real they’re acting contrary federal government don’t like whatever case is. 

Sorry sane Michigan people. people I’ve personally known Michigan great people. mean, people see going *arent* vaccinated. really care since am? way verifying every person I’m vaccinated, wait scientists say majority been. looking Snapchat- many parties last night, mask, close together. can’t help think incredibly selfish dangerous. wrong, it’s completely fine now? people don’t need gyms open healthy active? Looks like Venezuela, 0.05% partial vaccination. One lowest. easy say things get better, pretty rough situation.  true team Canada men’s hockey bunch Olympic golds.. last time USA men’s hockey 1980. we’ll save preventing single day summer lockdown grad students... could try calling clinics see extras. That's able get early. point. used really jacked lmao. macron could, know, vaccinate people instead introducing another meaningless curfew macron could, know, vaccinate people instead introducing another meaningless curfew forget disaster running trials... Germany gonna German. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Signed, ex-German. actually look *this* comment every single day!  That's half job, mostly Oxford's contribution project. half running trials, manufacturing distributing. AZ's part, done poor job. saying that? I'm sure **both** vaccinated 88 year olds Germany excited news. mean yeah, depending much risk mitigation enough you.

Here's pretty simple math, obviously complicated this, person 95% less likely COVID person B 95% less likely get it, 400x less likely spread COVID person person B. go scenarios like that, find risk incredibly small, gets larger groups get way bigger. hold 600 person orgies.

That also assuming people *do* get COVID vaccine likely spread it, probably true. numbers go even lower believe preliminary data.

Then, prevalence goes down, numbers get even lower.

The point is, long friends getting vaccinated, 600 person orgies back menu sooner think, dinner parties fully vaccinated people 100% okay. judging people social private vaccination, probably stuck pandemic mode, sort like recently rich people still can't bring shell guac chipotle. best thing try retrain brain view human interaction closeness good thing again, makes us human. don’t know plans countries, Denmark also get corona pass test negative (valid 72 hrs). Basically, haven’t vaccine get tested that’s that. europe free america certain extent? Demand super high pushed essential workers/teachers priority list. Massachusetts gotten lot people vaccinated, everyone killing governor prioritized considered “protected” two weeks J&amp;J. three weeks you’re even protected! go enjoy life now! 

However, comfortable yet, perhaps compromise would help? Outdoor baseball stadium week, indoor dining next week even protected four week mark? brought joke... policy real. 

In many states, smoker considered qualifying condition. North Carolina specified one must smoked 100 cigarettes lifetime qualify. 

I joked wife road-trip NC chain-smoke 100 cigarettes way qualify. Luckily mean time state (Ohio) moved phase anyone face eligible... start smoking get vaccinated. 🤣 open everyone already. B1.135 present England Israel many months failed really establish foothold. doesn’t appear degree transmissibility B.117 it’s looks like issues establishing environments rich B.117 high vaccine uptake Novavax trouble getting across finish line. case Moderna little different iirc 50% owned NIAID. world needs every vaccine get You’re missing VaxBot. actually sends notifications devices. Wait, free thinkers sub? Let's also make sure Moderna Novavax never involved vaccine manufacturing since smaller players.

Speaking personal perspective, long excessively high risk would anything currently legal. first project website spit “yo mama” jokes. frynotsureif.jpg bet will. see health insurance companies applying surcharge premiums unvaccinated members well account additional risk. Correction. None vaccines discussed live virus. That's old school. Well that’s kind said lol. majority B.117 they.... vaccinate people instead??? American 2 benefits Canada have. 

Economics scale. America largest economy, thus making profitable open vaccine factory (would build factory market 330 million people 30 million?), 

And specialization. America firms specializing bio-technology pharmacology. apparently goal vaccinations isn’t reduce COVID infection rate reduce rate severe cases? rate severe cases already really low. It’s quite funny person genesis misinformation accusing spreading misinformation 

Do everyone favor stay Reddit Maryland? Well sucks! 8 year old son's nickname ""Eek.""

Dammit. Go Red mean people don’t love wearing mask, big deal? kind hate wearing shoes, it. don’t get sort objection. messes human communication like smiling people. comfortable natural. Look you’re saying you’re okay masks mandates “feelings” don’t think many people would agree you. cost people quite lot, especially little kids can’t see facial expressions. there’s scientific reason, masks mandates, think reasonable. vaccine, masks come go back normal 24 hours Pfizer dose 1. Arm still bit sore, headache fatigue subsided yesterday. bad. Like I'm supporter FFFG rollout going badly? Nearly every get used within week. supply issues causing delay. Covid patients deteriorate fast Nobody knows long effective. know effective long we’ve studying them. reasons believe time might wane nobody knows sure case boosters would provided im sure. Get ASAP stop transmission covid move pandemic endemic. Linked live updated news post... link doesn’t even bring mentioned post anymore (if ever even did)... long Covid symptoms others mild cases get? years ago alma mater dealt outbreak Hand Foot Mouth disease (yes, one common young children) freshman dorms. related wearing masks outdoor places. one follow rule beach, even streets weather get warmer. ridiculous. can't image wear mask beach 35+ degrees celsius outside high humidity. sea? Let's stupid. Administration said herd immunity much hope government, fellow irish person herd immunity achieved rabbit hole


my favorite one say manchausen proxy

(someone learned new word day, didnt they? lol) soccer mums said bad obviously that's empirical evidence right? /s question whether ""freaking out"" *requiring* covid vaccine rational not. scientific studies concluded, ""freaking out"" perfectly rational read read trial studies. speculate happened? 

This vaccine design development years, suggestion threw caution wind wrong. thread seems dominated introverts. extroverted person, last year fucking destroyed me.

The combination losing income, wedding (and thousands dollars that), things love life, ability even go gym, isolation. lost months. I’d much rather go stadium tens thousands people **proved** they’ve vaccinated go one tens thousands people *promise* they’ve vaccinated. roughly half states lower infection rates provinces

These states must undertesting, death rates currently several times higher. long FDA approves it, agree lawsuit won’t stand. didn’t like us worst don’t deserve us best lol vast majority - 2,214 - B.1.1.7 variant commonly associated U.K. also 50 cases B.1.351 variant associated South Africa 379 cases P.1 variant associated Brazil.

One Vancouver Canucks NHL players got infected second time covid, time p1 Yeah, interesting see really runs things. Coke, Delta, Disney, else? Everything said false. got mine yesterday well! exciting Boner Champ nickname got drunk fucked snowman REALLY kept going it. Eh, I'm getting vaccine already covid. antibody test get around vaccination requirements Nah. Japan, anything made appreciate American more. Individualism issues America really freedom anywhere else I've loved. That’s wild. got 2nd dose Pfizer Wednesday, never single side effect. arm didn’t even hurt! Texas bit busy filing lawsuits mask mandate Austin ACA bothered. Yeah pandemic I've lived Texas Louisiana, hot fuck. despite snowmageddon year, we've relatively warm sunny weather past 2 years feel like got wrong. im mask life saving .001 possibility death. Take masks people!

Fun Fact: 70% Covid Deaths US people obese least 3.5 underlying conditions.

FREE FACE! BLOCK VAX PASSPORTS widespread fake IDs (Clubs, Alchohol, Etc...) Why? everyone vaccinated, what’s point distancing? Yes exactly, US paid first couple deliveries Dutch factory, doses produced US. Filling shortfall doses produced Netherlands literally stealing doses away contracts. That's see Dutch facility exporting US already expected since beginning, try blocked. Oh, that's interesting, thank you. Would considering return Japan's vaccine rollout better? think referring [this still visible makes mention DNA. 

But correct. study reference discuss RNA linked cancers (not changing DNA) I've removed point. opened 16+ CT day everyone know able get appointment, hope things pick guys! Sounds like stupid policy Wont happen. better start accepting now. Windshields block majority UV light. Side windows block half. Plus, there’s heat factor. leaving dashboard, depending live park, could actually effective.

I live AZ leave mine dashboard washing combined heat UV rays likely kill anything living them. nurses “absolute sausages”, aren’t trained things like epidemiology (but like think do?). Don’t mind them. Variants definitely risk among largely unvaccinated populations. places everyone vaccinated think it'll issue like renounced citizenship lol. even paid taxes! able issue whatever orders wants throughout whole thing. Nothing really changed front. better worse, owns state's response.

As far people listening D, that's exactly point - situation exists states. Illinois example red outside Chicago (yet) seeing surge nearly bad Michigan. think simply explain away Michigan's problems ""ignorant repubs ignore rules"" they're everywhere. lots vaccine manufacturing Quebec City (GSK) Toronto (Sanofi). flu whooping cough vaccines effective covid. hope so!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* “Regulations written blood.” left volition want come back vaccines Japan doesn't? thanks, stay there.

Props riding pandemic foreign country. fine months too. Pool's closed due capacity. hurting?

Well, benefit vaccine society creates safe environment. risk people may able take vaccine safely, may ineligible. 

Lemme tell CEV kid, go school right people around chose get vaccinated, could refused. Many people meets young risk. take out, safer people vaccinated. strange concept, think.

The vaccine personal risk profile. say acknowledging young, probably wont see kind bigger picture relevant worth it. is, definition, selfish. Thinking self instead societal benefit.

I also try qualify insult, try take such. Prioritizing makes sense, especially younger demographics almost expected.  Nobody cares ethnicity employees, kind absurdity this. Janssen J&amp;J U.S. companies, making vaccine funded U.S. government, filled completed U.S.

You're advocating Dutch government seize private assets U.S. company. always: Lots things kill coronavirus. Finding something kills *in vivo* kill *vivo* difficult. God wish lived America Cool go another university take gap year. Nobody required go cornell family contact problem? getting downvoted this? Technically true. _well-sourced_ details exactly happened [J&amp;J/Pfizer Emergent BioSolutions days ago? Specifically know components involved mixed up? think also fact people checked Covid left really passionate people want pretend last year happen.

But yeah seem bots. always find interesting post histories. Either created couple months ago posted anything years now. tested positive yesterday I’m asymptomatic Asthma Sleep Apnea Sinusitis. normal? got tested today make sure. I’m really confused don’t symptoms yet. That's there's mass Exodus yet state vaccine database. Assuming provider reports state, able get printout showing covid vaccine along vaccines you’ve recent years. Good hear it. Hard know ins outs ground live Japan. work south african strain I’ve got weird shit going too. I’m somehow simultaneously excited get old life back also dreading idea sitting office 9+ hours day talk people. It’s really strange. live Japan moment things glacially slow here. I'm US citizen, figured might good idea get shot. B? I'm disagreeing, wondering involved production chain considered exporting? Obviously product exported multiple times different points value chain, that's modern commerce works. August can't get wherever live? widely available US next month. difference make students want vaccination gets it, people get infected notable degree chose get it? crazy differences within US, live AZ, people wear kat outside even peak pandemic. unvaccinated people keep virus strong healthy, likely aggressive mutations. Look flu. mutates quickly yearly flu shot hoping minimize sick get, tune best 40% effective, various mutations. Basically, time shot available, flu almost certainly mutated time time again, though shot helps mitigate severity death.

So far, COVID hasn’t mutated speed flu, it’s possible quite selfish people refuse get vaccinated general population. Imagine waking deciding choose asshole instead prevent death. Sorry interrupt great game moment. shots arms good thing. literally piece paper. US could set database last year rollout, prioritized shots arms able verify. June, demand, I'd think so. also get way rest nowadays therefore better mood. Biden administration 2.5 months. That’s long they’ve office. former guy’s administration didn’t plan vaccine distribution. efficacy two doses AZ much higher efficacy one dose J&amp;J. 

None vaccines perfect terms efficacy every approved vaccine great tool reducing outbreaks. immunity perfection always add boosters later. Yeah like pretending data exist. head CDC releasing statement saying vaccinated can't get sick can't carry virus, Fauci saying he's waiting data. Maybe should, know, talk? There's still growing number man buns tbh get husband trim hair day! Cornell plays Fauci connection. well should. went Cornell Med School, he’s Cornellian. EU, Ireland least, probably finish vaccinating everyone couple weeks UK bad all. I'm thankful speedy vaccination rollout effective vaccines large extended family get together safely Easter today. We've apart year feels nice point! Even young adults college students able get vaccinated time, relief. Good hopefully every college follows suite ""Cornell enforce COVID policies.""


""Cornell immediately punish students follow strict mandatory testing schedule caught breaking social distancing mask policies.""


Pick one these. absolutely shameful insanely ignorant. 


If mRNA worked (Pfizer/Biontech Moderna) we'd absolutely screwed making due bit AZ JJ point. Given case numbers things would really dire. knew many kids jumped fuckers finals week. That's like Reddit young males. J&amp;J useful, never able get herd immunity single shot J&amp;J vaccine. efficacy single shot enough. stuck top Less potential hosts spreaders, reducing numbers. nothing situation, it'll get better vaccines administered. person meant they're exporting vaccines. vaccine US EU invested harder countries get. That's point. Yep. Check post OP’s comment history. He’s anti-masker anti-lockdown anti-science throwaway account meant sway public opinion.

I'm going continue taking supplements strengthen immune system hopefully year need vaccine anyway. Here's hoping. Yes I’m faculty university much hope approach fall. dean recently pointed out, however, can’t mandate vaccinations vaccines emergency approval. understand logic there, would like full approval happen quickly. “science” shows state 6M people average single digit deaths per day month now.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly. Hospitals like beds filled means survive business. Ahh seems pretty variable overall come back life continue stay inside isolated vaccinated? not, I’m sure they’re connected all. 10-20% chance contracting him.

An important distinction - would true 100% guaranteed infected vaccinated. 80% reduction risk infection, thing 20% risk infection.

Let's say take steps reduce unvaccinated risk infection husband 30%. vaccination, risk 6%. Also, reminder tomorrow may see artificial drop reported vaccinations holiday today stopping reporting. 

I think overall Easter affect numbers much bc 1) Sunday always lowest day week administrations (it less half administered doses compared Saturday Monday offer) 2) places capacity yet, anywhere closed Easter today administer doses next days. Kids probably risk, concern covid allowed spread readily among school age population, might end strains. Hopefully that's something avoid, certainty. months back took learning Raspberry Pi built “Pandemic Clock” Instead actual time shows day week vague times like “Zero dark thirty”, Early Morning” “Noon-ish” “late afternoon” ect. I’m tempted rewrite program start showing rough dat month, like “Early April” shocks predict 38% population gain immunity vaccination only. Countries like Israel seem like 90% total immunity. model truly asumming lot people vaccinated. Also take account people 12-15 able vaccinated starting early summer another 16b next year. long segment population neglected pandemic, nidus new infections mutations. agree delaying reopening separate issue. open now, happy way things going. nearly impossible work kids class give home attention need. we're dealing tech issues class well online stuff.

I skimmed article, saw increased access tech low income, modified schedules, grading policies, see anything continuing distance hybrid learning. Yeah shit sacrificed what? CDC fully agree you. true is, paralysis rare vaccines. Oral vaccines recommended unless there's outbreak area. mean, really depends person, I'm sure person hospitalized could easily hospitalized flu point. Eh, truly drug save lives one sure regular step aside, proven see little point allowing so. Whether ""good thing"" likely depends whether 10% world deploying vaccine, 90% isn't. totally feel saying, least wait second dose let hair down. I've heard getting covid doses delay get second dose. Totally can't wait fun summer tho, going amazing #3TH WORLD WARRIORS actually matter meaningful way? Maybe don’t claim bad statistics none article? think college class online, it’s probably fine six year old, too.  get out. Wear mask, respect others, see nothing worry about. Right?? Like clearly someone never near baby. *very* pro-mask wearing one since long region mandated it. literally even *safe*, let alone feasible, put mask infant.  vaccinate weekends,

At moment limiting factor number vaccine available. point we'll face limitation regarding number people able give vaccine. nurse/doctor vaccination centre seeing patients. goes second line healthcare worker like firemen. rather knowing well rested monday giving jab 6 days week filling overtime quota use ventilation treatment decreased alongside surge ventilator production lack never really became problem seemed might be. Pfizer 1st shot, sore arm pretty warm night 1st day, stop lifting though haha saw recent paper measured R children concluded less one. I've lost link now. imagining R&lt;1 original strains, B1.1.7 50% contagious, R B1.1.7 could one. Vaccine nationalism seems bit stretch. US already given vaccines Mexico Canada. Also, makes sense US focus vaccinating citizens first. bought vaccines choose want them. fault EU massively fucked vaccine purchases rollout. think people going give hang privileges go effect? Genuine question people already giving six months able go anywhere except office grocery store.  virus circulates significant percentage people refuse vaccine increased chances mutate form makes vaccine less effective, still matter. kids going developmentally screwed don’t get real schooling soon Good name band. Remove credits sounds stupid everyone. Add credit quote specific portion people think it’s genius. Comment really make sense unless trying troll Exactly this. need many people vaccinated possible. Obviously high risk unable get vaccinated, matters even get vaccinated.

I’m high risk group right getting vaccine tomorrow. Basic example people understand husband doesn’t get vaccine contracts it, could 10-20% chance contracting him. Multiply lot potential exposure could also get unvaccinated people. gets vaccinated, it’s additional layer protection reduces chances contraction further. strong reaction first moderna dose barely reaction second think lesson. also never “knowingly” Covid. can't drop good limited cig daily ration 20 4. would estimate number kids education emotional development permanently affected vs number parents actually killed via school spread? unions ones asking delay reopening right continue hybrid learning Yeah i'm mostly worried parents elderly. also help i've apart girlfriend year due flight restrictions. pretty good effectiveness 14 days first shot I'm pretty sure, MRNA effective JnJ shot 14 days. got second dose Pfizer morning state fairgrounds NY, smooth operation waiting line either dose.

Most people talk either gotten doses way them. Pretty good. got lot (deserved) shit beginning vaccinate without completed efficacy trials thesis phase 1/2 nobody poor reactions, meaning worst ineffective harmful. 

Subsequent data shown 90 percent effectiveness many experts believe it’s effective vaccine. Russia excellent scientists long history producing medicines used around world don’t doubt effective safe vaccine. would still rather get Pfizer Moderna vaccines seem still offer protection variants also, US, won’t option get Sputnik V. know 3 type 0s. one symptoms (exactly 2 weeks apart), one bad symtpoms (maybe 14-16 days apart), one really bad symptoms (can't remember 2 4 weeks apart she'd also covid previously immune system probably recognized more.) needs stop saying conflicting things. It’s getting real annoying. Ostherholm gets lot airtime, experts U.K studied B.1.1.7 found risk kids concerning reported. I’ll attach Twitter thread below, it’s important see different experts saying. 

[Kids B.1.1.7 empathy beautiful thing. people matter &lt;3. weeks mask wearing caution least could save lives Michigan. least think  agree. more. that's lots vaccines. know whether failure AZ not. logical answer like thought. Nobody paid anyone last time it’s never going happen. might want re-read sentence think beyond preconceived opinion subject. think people never get vaccine mindset, think people going go way get vaccine think change anything. Like someone brought door would take current circumstances think worth effort. So... cdc says travel fully vaccinated, director says it’s absolutely essential. mixed message? *that* safe even fully vaccinated? month unfortunately, perhaps beginning June. talking group 30-40y receiving letter end June first vaccine. uptake lower 90% might get letter before. Young healthy? P1 care it. Hospitals Brazil full people 30 55 P1 soon everywhere. Probably caution. Danish vaccine calendar looked unrealistically optimistic couple weeks ago compared ones rest EU - they've planning according doubled Biontech doses starting April ever since announced, EU countries refrained updating schedules doses actually start coming (probably avoid fallout end getting burned manufacturer - though Biontech/Pfizer reasonably reliable track record). Italy's double too. mean shaming people broke pandemic protocols worked two months initial outbreak response, ""quarantine"" people stoped caring difficult things worked then. winter, things got much much worse, gatherings taboo initial outbreak response. wish lied potential longevity virus length abided mitigation measures front. wish previous US admin saw national security issue instead fluke pandemic.

I understand point restrictions fully needed people getting vaccinated, tough situation young people including kids getting sick going back sports unmasked activities even vaccine yet. save many lives possible would let Americans go outside ever again. chance dying every time get car. course, realistic, preventing death logical. Well primary motive open medical campus Qatar’s university city money insulting world-renowned Ivy League institution like Cornell. lot people claim Cornell alums without ever stepping foot main campus NY find plastic lack better term. Universities like Harvard, Oxford, Princeton would never open campus would significantly damage reputation. Plus much harder maintain world class standards campuses world totally different governing boards. feels like cheap move Cornell motivated money exclusively. vaccine 100% effective, claim it’s 100% effective, never vaccine that’s 100% effective practice. Schools open am, state. Teachers happy hybrid model. local reps assured us unless there's major shift things summer full back next fall. bizarre many ppl think vaccine tracking card legal medical document. need laminate it. wanna save it? time being, yeah. Take pic sides photocopy it--keep copy wallet case, put original rest health records. legal document. WHAT, WHO. Always been. dont see wouldn't, adults vaccinated want vaccinated point, kids really dying virus, least 3,405,638 kids tested positive covid, probably million covid tested positive, far 250 died covid... that's lower yearly flu. 400-500 kids die, unless want close schools every year flu, open schools fall. don’t even possess enough self awareness realize fact even able get internet form coherent sentence express opinion possible of.... drumroll please... SCHOOLS! 100% population vaccinated mean 100% immune even herd immunity end variant going around one vaccines protect against. Promote vaccines ticket back normal life increase vaccine uptake. they're extent. lot unsettling caginess masks. they're least getting something. 2 months left school year. might even disrupt learning get used whole new way schooling sudden far in. would easier start beginning new school year. Goodness, category got vaccinated 2 *weeks* ago North Carolina. certain threshold, yes. that, letting everyone hang would overflow hospitals, letting vaccinated people hang out. ""the worst yet come!"" repeat Ad infinitum hope kids’ sake. It’s normal never normal kids sit alone front computer day, allowed play kids, eat alone even able see kids’ faces. everyone get vaccine chance give kids lives back. Yep. mean, AZ dropped ball many times. It’s honestly pathetic. Bad data, bad trial handling accidental half doses, bad production…no thanks. Might perfectly acceptable vaccine I’m honestly sure AZ screwed without help Covid factors beyond control. Guess many Teens die car crashes. Guess many hospitalized. It’s also lot don’t ban cars. Quite possibly also may want dust dirt knows. Lots farm workers wear bandanas covid 🤯 entire family US already first dose won’t get mine like Thanksgiving. It’s embarrassing; wanted stay Germany years finish school they’ve done everyone dirty past six months I’m gonna nope free degree. How's different ID'd pub venues? Wrong. Look New Jersey--our hospitalizations up, 85% hospitalized 45. proof positive vaccines work younger age groups get covid severe enough hospitalization needed. wondering excuse would use vaccinate kids chances getting ill less percent percent. sick like week one year speech class. week assigning times us give speeches next week, topic three visual aids. even think sick, went Monday find prof assigned one first slots first day. used someone sick sign-ups went end presentation list thought people abusing put front.

That exciting. still feeling great give impromptu speech three visual aids, prepared for. ended giving speech working computer science undergrad research assistantship used whiteboard draw visual aids try illustrate work doing.

Got B- bad given sick, required visual aids, lead time. kinda pissed whole thing, though. Luckily, fine giving speeches general, can't imagine would've gone one many students got super-nervous giving speeches.  tweet rap lyrics, [that's hate (if white). I'm wearing mask grocery store children get vaccine. mean underage kids? virus deadly kids, pretty much par flu young kids. Also maskless people see young kids. reason, kids 8-9 wear masks stores. effective lowering chance, 100% prevention.  lot people decieved way way.

That's they're saying even vaccinated still mask right. Poland. TUE-FRI surge 110-200k vaccinations per day, today example dropped 30k. worry, we'll add another couple tril national debt.  Yeah, vaccine turned totally unnecessary countries willing sacrifices, right? need sell them. google print own. wonder if, vaccinations ramp up, people get vaccinated start browse sub less, less relevant them, increasing proportion antivaxxers. experience kids wear masks asked. Yes, there's really evidence one Pfizer dose continues provide degree protection beyond 3-4 weeks. 

It *might*, course. almost zero risk kids. Go live life. It’s less wanting go, feeling you’re *supposed* first year college, meningitis outbreak paid entire student body get vaccinated.

After year, new students vaccinated order come school. like sorta poop last hour about, get home soon start walking door crippling bout peristalsis. instead hanging on, go ahead shit pants almost bathroom. certainly haven’t claimed it’s major consideration it’s Ill-conceived it’s brought many times since start pandemic. One relationship direct killing virus, well sunlights relationship vitamin production human body. It’s also free print card. Templates internet. Alright. get educated you’re already educated, got it. Yeah middle class family paying nearly much. takes one instance like astra Zeneca vaccine. takes one instance like astra Zeneca vaccine. J&amp;J: ""Are Really Charge Here?"" line argument next door ""but flu, bro"" good CNN impression?

No, dead ringer average FoxNews viewer FDA approved. Non emergency modern definition. collapse Soviet Union 1991, definition instead largely shifted country little political risk well-functioning democracy, rule law, capitalist economy, economic stability, high standard living.""

It also 2 world theory, three world theory. 1st world = Western allied, 2nd = USSR allied, 3rd world = unallied. term shifted tiers economic development. incompetent. mess trial badly twice. First trial doses second stats correctly.  None pharmaceuticals companies going profit vaccines due optics. They’ll make money long haulers long run. don’t care disagree. age banding, medical conditions, overweight, least 80-85% adult population eligible Monday. That's go adults shortly thereafter. dose #1 yea. dont sides expecting traditional side effecrs like fever etc. one scarier since look tinnitus stuff theres cure I’m desperate find anyone else went away. quick searches looks possible rare think census mRNA vaccines last average 6 months. Personally, I’m still social distancing going I’m going wait May-ish get vaccinated. Everyone’s situation different, though. course. respiratory viruses, similar death rates, usually kill people older average life expectancy. comparable? Yeah, let's open schools! Kids known following strict rules guidelines, right!? No, it’s 100% effective , we’re trying keep vaccine-resistant variants popping up, college classes often large. ""hastily reverses reopening""... pretty much everything still open. real lockdown, bullshit. nothing put stress people without actually addressing root causes spread. racist piece sh!t. Rubbish. receive nearly twice amount Pfizers received March J&amp;J start delivering well. database, lose card look issue new one. dont believe data science! today, far tell, one died allergic reaction vaccine. anaphylactic shock events none resulted death. say happen eventually, today, believe death. 

Therefore, saying ""1000 times likely die COVID"" massive underestimate. like *at minimum* 1 million times likely die COVID allergic reaction related vaccine. year people still comparing covid flu.. question “did they” “should have”? debate latter want former isn’t interesting Even if...! places world need vaccination travelling, parts Africa, Asia... micromanaged local scale. Sorry, typo, meant covud have. One key principles biology. virtually 1 also zero whenever chance plays role.

However, person get downvoted? all, question everyone needs know answer. swine flu pandemic 2009. require vaccine passport that? It’s lax testing rate. live TX people getting complacent ever since March due vaccine availability. led people getting tested “we vaccines, it’s almost over! need get tested wear mask anymore!” one difference covid vaccines approved emergency use. Never trust article give raw data percentages. Way prove point/ covid past doesn’t give lasting immunity. 60% still lot... exactly people getting vaccinated companies trying get workers prioritized? issue right supply, demand. Shut take upvote! Hmm, UK schools went full remote past months? Please stop, embarrassing real doctors like me. Children need wear mask antibacterial genes prevent viruses spreading them. someone worked Pharmacology 20 years (Dr. Brandy Goldberg, look up) PhD, find arguments honestly hilarious. think undeerestimate nuts bunch academic achievers are, anything makes likely paranoid idea eradicate covid, impossible. idea buy us bit time vaccinate significant portion population. still three months go everyone received first dose, B.1.1.7. now. brazilian variant also growing increasingly threatening. 

When enough people vaccinated, course, forget zero covid we'll tolerate level infections, hospitalizations deaths. would temporary strategy. No, makes sure people need first get first.

If expand eligibility much quickly bad sign good sign. always keep vaccination speed maximum spillage minimum. smaller eligibility groups high low risk, superior. Mass. clearly 6th state terms first doses. cannot definitely expand eligibility groups. Nevada probably wrong.

It mostly shows vaccine hesitancy regions need expand eligibility earlier supple keep vaccination rates maximum.

Also, people low risk really want vaccinated still want vaccinated 3 weeks, change lot end. assures people need get earlier.

And could say tons appointments, 40% adults still need vaccine (assuming 70% adults want vaccine). means still lot demand, problems filling appointment slots while, even stricter priority groups (unless area embarrassingly low vaccine hesitancy). mean could also made lot effort making possible young people restricting old people more.

Let's say restaurants bars open, old people. way young people spread old people less, balance works. Maybe old people gym. could given privileges less, younger people. ""cause"" hospitals overflowing, maybe giving more?

But no, Europe indiscriminate lockdown mostly young give social lives. segregating restrictions based age negotiable ethics, sure fuck old people get first line get freedom back. 

You see easily could locked old people outside world given (not all) freedom people little risk virus? didn't, solidarity. Reddit weird. Article day FL governor issuing order banning covid passports guy widely bashed it. Boris Johnson approves covid passports going forward he's bashed well. Good, doubt many people get Cornell stupid enough get vaccinated. 

But conversation well educated in-law someone tell bullshit vaccine she’s letting 19 &amp; 22 year old children get it. I’m still stunned talk people hear stupidity like this. Yeah Tuesday numbers probably going cause panic daily thread lol. quote flew lot people's heads. Almost year old leader country said this. month ago i'd agree you, right California people literally choices 3 vaccines various locations. really limited slot time availability far willing drive. 2 mRNA shots need set aside time 2nd dose, convenience issue. submission linking blogspot.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

 ""Osterholm quack."" still think him, ""Osterholm giving worst case scenario hope occur."" definitely opinion now.  shills day Easter bullet killed capitalistic societies

their bloodlust exploit working class fly cheap labor around instead paying local people living wages going demise western societies It’s many people scientifically uneducated efficacy risk constant fear-mongering news doesn’t help. certainly 1 20 chance getting Covid fully vacced- much, much less. I’ve read much less 1%, things considered, that’s still figured out. Seems right, though. vaccines GOOD, almost goddamn miracles, fact. 

Even unvacced people living household less 20% chance getting it. hate vaccines continue downplayed like that. would want get vaccine chances still high vacced? It’d make people want get Covid get reinfections rare. 

That, lock house eternity. meant like people getting tested much used to, least TX. People much lax people gotten vaccinated. possible virus spreading around enough people getting tested. measures taken would far deaths.
  
Counterfactuals unfalsifiable therefore unscientific statements. far, US least 30 million cases confirmed. Either way, solution losing liberties. deaths, means totalitarianism worked; need more. many deaths, means authoritarian enough measures; need more. 
  
The death rate even lower consider asymptomatic fact deaths due covid. especially ridiculous compare countries strict quarantine (like Argentina) others (Uruguay, US, Sweden, Israel, etc.). result? Argentina among top ten cases, higher death rate demonized US masks mandatory significant number people refused wear them.
   
Ever noticed measures enough? first days, weeks, months, year, one mask, two masks, vaccine, second dose, third dose, first wave, second wave, passports... almost harmless, overrated disease. new normal. last time government cared much you? America 🇺🇸
Country Conflicts Also common person differentiate ""efficacy,"" ""effectiveness."" One dose gives around 80% immunity, fine. Canada's strategy one dose, second 4 months later. Ontario administered 2,424,063 doses. 
It received 2,825,795. 

The difference ""nearly million.""

The last seven days, Ontario distributed 507,731 doses.

This greater weekly delivery, Certainly greater 150K number say missed. 

Those numbers, partisan bias. 

It's hard take seriously. What? WTF science reading? Anaphylaxis reason FDA approve something. case, peanuts would banned. Yup, site one accurate cases pandemic, sad actual professional disease modelers, whose models mostly way worse site know anyone get vaccine think go back normal, know people (primarily myself) burnt fuck lockdown clear end date sight driving edge. know real attack rate is? new variants? infectious person cough face infected breathe in, infected 100%? understand concept low attack rate virus like this. variables pure luck virus particle get receptor nose/mouth? kid know lots parents lol .

Don’t get wrong, it’s legitimate question considering CNN become panic network, I’m sure it’s intentions good here

“How long coronavirus vaccines protect number means lot, there’s least two week delay vaccinations cases/deaths plummeting. 

We’re already beginning see deaths go down, they’ll go faster every day. 100 million people US least one dose, guys better almost every country world. 

Appreciate have, positive, dark chapter history ending country. wish country even remotely close situation Someone read article. ****insert triggered anti vaxxer also supported families lost homes Gatlinburg wildfires!  work, though. accepted increased risk alternative risk worse. one incident probably make news. overall, general pace production high, largely risks we're accepting. Quality assurance processes prevent risking lives people getting vaccine, really production rates.

We need win every wager, win lose. Agree. happy get say that? Measles, Polio, Yellow Fever, Smallpox, Malaria endemic US too. ""Available everyone"" means children well. Available adults condition. ""everyone"" mean adults, agree. kids idea talking about. Pfizer/Moderna ""better"" results, unfair say J&amp;J worse trials conducted different times. J&amp;J done period cases higher deadly strains around, could skewed numbers. That's really apples apples comparison.

Experts suggest getting whichever vaccine get first delay vaccination trying get ""better"" one. point, think they’d likely tell everyone keep masks public allowing people aren’t regular contact underage kids ease social distancing. 

They’d tell parents stay “bubbles” there’s vaccine kids available info whether cause surge adults shots arms. EU tried playing nice 

No didn't. ""big lie"" EU chauvinists Reddit keep pushing. pushing. pushing. 

The actual EU however. 

The EU's problems caused graciously allowed exports humanitarian grounds.

They exist tried buy vaccines advance - like UK US - bet Sanofi Janssen AZ, due cost, ordered small quantity BNT/Pfizer. 

Because EU ordered 100 million Pfizer doses, - quite reasonably - sold rest production buyers. EU could prevented earlier simply placing larger order. 


As turned out, Sanofi's vaccine work, AZ shortfalls, J&amp;J 5 months behind BNT/Pfizer production.



*If* EU's bet paid received 700 million J&amp;J Sanofi doses January, would used doses EU; companies exporting doses would bound deliver EU.

In *exactly way* US UK receiving enough doses bought everything could early advance. Starting see indications feds finally getting pressured put things high gear frustratingly slow, yes. Hermetically seal door every elderly care center don’t let anyone 😅. Maybe give stack old playboy mags, knitting guides crate whiskey tide old folks over. death rate 1%, US would 3.3 Million deaths.

Read post history. think whole anti-vaxxer thing overblown people need something still feel anxious vaccines available. really need feel angry suspicious people community? helpful?

The history resistance smallpox vaccines long complicated. first form vaccine, variolation, basically dangerous smallpox itself. Even developed safe vaccines lot resistance them. Larry Diamond interviews India people believed smallpox kind benevolent spirit hid children vaccinators. Suffice say anti-vaxxers didn’t start Jenna Jameson. That's basically I'm saying. Blanket statements like one replied going make people pause states enough. Exactly this. I’m getting exhausted frustrated amount vaccine comparisons smugness vaccine “better”. They’re effective great, get literally whichever one can. Serious question: point posting misinformation? Covid far deadlier flu lingering consequences many survive. simple google search web pages end .gov .org show many people typically die flu vs many far died covid. that's social distancing, sanitizing, mask wearing shut downs. 

And traveled? many jurisdictions world require proof vaccines visit country. nothing new. Requiring covid vaccine simply added list. want travel attend concert get vaccine. achieve herd immunity stay home.

I’m New Normal. fact, normal knew March 2020 doesn’t exist anymore. Whether like not. Jobs, concerts, events, won’t anymore. least foreseeable future. 

I’d rather new normal continued lock down. know say. say know. Sadly, already mutating. December least twelve variants listed US CDC. 

The media reporting increases ratings make ton money (just like everything). think follow mask, hygiene distancing guidelines rest folks get vaccinations sensible. go something enjoy, mingle fully vaccinated people, etc. government's chance right. multiple chances implement proper lockdown.

In North America we've learned lockdowns insufficient. 

Please implement another half measure lockdown. need get done right.  I’m sure general public go “vaccine passports,” absolutely intend keep mask cold/flu season. luck, might help slow spread “typical” illnesses.   Probably Harvard, though.

Harvard cheap, even best school Cambridge, Massachusetts. (And Caltech girl, pains praise MIT like that.) 7’2” anon Lmao said incredibly stupid... doesn’t surprise though. There’s literally nothing wrong wanting wait get vaccine research comes out.

I’ll play game though. strike kind person regurgitates narrative zero understanding science. college student still calls mom homework help (she’s genius, that’s definitely advantageous)—they appreciate assistance eventually appropriately thank it. Keep love dedication. pass buck feds, simply blame supply bottlenecks. Oh that’s great. people might accent upper portion Canada like. Everyone else doesn't. height first wave pandemic, far many MA/NY/NJ plates Maine New Hampshire, drive Long Sands York Beach, epicenter plates (with mask-less “visitors”) seemed outnumber Maine/NH plates...

Please tell “going beach” “Essential” activity, especially Massachusetts bloody beaches!  Teachers unions allow continue.

I always feel like saying- pick one. first time ‘ sick’ good me. feels like flu without runny nose cough. Surprised immune response (2nd shot moderna) age 61. universities struggling justify high tuition costs remote classes, they’re pushing in-person classes.  long everyone wants vaccine get one, doesn’t really matter.

Politicians suggest idea fuck off. telltale sign idiot someone throws insult completely ignoring point argued  Oh twitter. That's go science now. J&amp;J viral vector like Astrazeneca. sure J&amp;J also based genetical modified virus not. 

Yeah approaches much closer traditional vaccines, much lower possibility error transported administered. EUA approved giving out. I'm sorry guy lost, reason troll internet dangerous misinformed information vaccines. 

There things mankind stupid themselves, one things, proven here, unable put others oneself trying times, basically whole reason government exists. really won’t. functionally similar investigating Losartan treatment COVID early pandemic? ever pan out? memory serves Losartan (common hypertension drug) makes body produce excess ACE2 freefloats around thinking extra ACE 2 distracts COVID attacking actually important ACE2. something. Obviously way described I'm much scientist type. :) Kids always super spreaders. truth sub REALLY want admit to. know efficacy single Oxford? Generally say efficacy News, overall efficacy, right?

it good already studying figure ways make rare cases even less likely.  Fantastic straw man argument... guess second statement comment applies lmao What? Apples oranges. saying kids adapt changes way adults able to? Sorry, human development needs take backseat bc virtual learning available. kids done great disservice developmentally kept peers. Yes get meeting someone taking home. want hold bars responsible come contact bar, shouldn’t let anyone HIV+ come in! one thing always feared. really concerning. virus changed affect younger population, lots fuel far largely unaffected areas No, wrong. myth driven superficial newspaper headlines. correct zero hospitalizations Pfizer JnJ test group (there two hospitalizations Moderna test group). However, confidence intervals findings large placebo group hospitalizations ranged 5-9 incidents each. Moderna, clinical study showed 89% effectiveness CI 80-98% happen couple hospitalizations (real world efficacy likely greater 89%). 

Initial research Israel's vaccinations real world populations showed relatively poor [87% Pfizer, revised subsequent data around 97-98% latest MoH data. However, data challenges due challenge finding demographic pairs: got vaccine likely interact people vaccinated, whereas get vaccine (e.g., ultra-orthodox) likely interact people get either - resulting significant confounding effects. 

Regardless exact percentage, vaccines 100% protective hospitalization death. Unfortunately vaccine perfect. vaccines incredibly effective thankful that. saying 100% effective hospitalization death help anyone - because, again, gives anti-vaxxers excuse get potentially prevent end endemic spread. Also, call current students *well educated*. They're still learning.  Oddly enough I’ve really conscientious since first shot. I’m going let shot 2 plus 2 weeks. (Also live someone can’t start vaccination end month I’m darned anything home 2+2 well!) read fucking article thread commented in? Osterholms claims came true....in Canada. shouldn’t enjoy things vaccinated people privilege doing. Don’t complain bar concert venue require proof vaccinations. case surge young people presumed vaccinated. anything showcases vaccines work lol imagine big chunk trial group people studied Israel UK. rare? around 5000 recently Poland (2500 people 14 days second dose). Fo course shithole country one check strain infected with. people dropping straight facts Cornell 11% admission rate

To fair, that's pretty high school prestigious. Got one kids enrolled moderna trial 6mo-12years, gets fist dose couple weeks! fuck would go New Hampshire Please tell everyone town. went store hour ago ONE WEARING MASK. Like, I'm wearing shit benefit assholes. Makes angry. say vaccine effective second shot.

I think say maximum efficiency vaccines reached second shot. mean first shot result protection yet. idea extending gap already get efficiency much people course 12 weeks. means vaccinate vulnerable part population much faster long efficiency single shot 'enough' (less 2 shots, still quite bit protection), that's win.

At least that's way understand it. key rigorous corona response and/or population respecting restrictions.

How think rigorous Corona response possible? think coordinates response? makes restrictions populace follow? you’re feeling sick exposed go appointment 14 days symptoms start. want expose others vaccine site. Even rapid test says negative would still quarantine get pcr test going appointment. Worst case aren’t infected reschedule appointment pain shouldn’t cause issues vaccine 6 week gap fine necessary. please potentially expose people trying get vaccinated workers based rapid tests fairly high false negative rates boggles mind Michigan 40% vaccination 70+, Colorado announced 80% today. I, don’t “like it”. everyone would exposed vaccinated see need wearing one. job standpoint, commute 1 hour way every day adds entire MONTH year wasted.

Think that. entire fucking month life pissed away waiting.

I ever want go back that. rate, we'll herd immunity early July!  feel bad whoever tried teach basic logic reasoning skills. No, it’s terrible grammar lack punctuation. Let’s say you’re charge - tasked saving American lives possible. would differently? correct indeed! Well, guess either government quoted uncorrected sources keeping cautios approach. quota cut reason. Even though science shows masks show little stopping spread You’re right. Thanks correction — two weeks post shot #2 done this! vaccines least fully approved though. generation asked go foreign hostile country fight war country.

This generation asked wear cloth mask stand 6 feet away someone country ""difficulties"" great bear some. eaten free krispy Kreme donut? downvoted oh thats right Anti-Vaxx MAGAT people exist still agree generally histrionic wouldn’t go far saying he’s quack. covid weed god send recovery, thankfully I’m California pick Yep. hardcore pro social distancing person. travelling hanging friends I'm fully vaccinated (less 4 weeks go!). ridiculous public health messaging ""get shot live life."". They're alienating many people way. Remember deaths lag cases even hospitalizations weeks due extended hospital stays delayed death record reviews. even so, average daily deaths doubled last three weeks Michigan (16 31). Things obviously little different due vaccines, people used argument back June October - deaths skyrocketed. Lol I'm literally counting days go gym again. Ah, guess sort got point. longer dine patio, go Costco mill around 500 people allowed inside per ""reduced capacity"" rules. Flu vaccinations always incredibly lacking every year. 


So reasonable say amount people get fatal COVID infection specific scenario children infecting likely lower amount flu deaths cause, chance overall flu infection higher majority adults vaccinated whole. I'm saying consider likely.  


You initially wrote ""vaccine available everyone"". That's find unnecessary. think level risk mitigation would needed consider dealt with. Adult population 70%-80% would enough. We're 40% now, slight majority probably another week.  


Herd immunity impact vaccinated all. 20% adult population unvaccinated, specific scenario unvaccinated child giving fatal COVID infection quite low.  


We still vaccinate children can, need wait till point take things back normal. high percentage vaccinated adults enough, especially places lower population density. general developing world use AZ, Russian Chinese vaccines can’t get AZ.

Its opposite. use mostly chinese, russian vaccines, AZ cant get tthose. Also worked volunteered schools, seen kids refuse leave shoes on, seen kids shit playground &amp; classroom, caught student writing poop (not his) bathroom walls... can't help wonder kids masking distancing rules. framing every vacinne also failing? He’s quoting idiot. happened Dr Brandy Goldberg's u/obsessbad **expert opinions?** still protect people though. Vaccinations 100% effective.   

Sure, risk low, go solely risk need drop restrictions people recently infected well.   

Overall imho shortsighted move definitely lead resentment might lead lot lower adherance corona measures. felt pretty bad first dose. think actual issue sore arm, mostly blame celebrating much wine feeling shitty yesterday lol sure? I've never seen number before.  since last summer least. Broadway figured way show online would paid see them! know it? Yep. Community spread great risk multiplier. flu always manageable disease. incomparable Covid, stop making comparison. many areas world, covid #1 killer, even higher cancer heart disease, would actually reasonable compare one agree age certainly plays factor. regardless age, wish peoples first instinct try reach understanding rather think worst others. get internet degree that’s things are. don’t be. Nice! think next month sentiment true. less half michigan even first shot vaccine. deaths lag behind cases weeks. early tell. Nobody gives damn may true unfortunately. also it’s premature. Wear damn mask science says otherwise. data yet. Funny American nationals living / working somewhere else expatriates, everyone else immigrant. 3 weeks 2 weeks post shot? believe moderna Pfizer full protection 2 weeks second shot. Well they’re forcing get vaccinated... It’s passport let go places. don’t get vaccinated, that’s problem. another 15B go. paywall like pharmacist America. knowingly left  dozens dozens temperature sensitive vaccines refrigeration ""go bad"". Why? believe virus real. isn’t, experts public health officials saying this. vaccinated ticket flout restrictions “get back normal.” still infected, still spread disease, new variants potential lower efficacy vaccine. Follow experts: get vaccinated, continue mask socially distance. That’s end pandemic. French guy here, way government treats us absurd, teenagers killing committing crimes ever, curfew 7 PM . . Well i'm still looking reason mister Macron closed schools month.

It's chaos every country seeing light end tunnel except mine damn it. US world. 
J&amp;J ~10 USD / dose, that's good. rest way (and pretty demanding logistics). 
AstraZeneca ~3 USD (x2 assume). 
 
For lot countries difference cost huge importance. initiatives richer countries donate vaccines, that's great. likely going go cheapest vaccine gets job done, that's AstraZeneca. 
 
So think AstraZeneca vaccine still used vaccine across world (if actually manage start delivering amounts promised). cheap works. know children 11 exist, too. Right? I'm stupid one?

According rate we're going 3.07 million doses day, could get 70% people fully vaccinated July 10th new variants actually becoming issue. confirmed theory floated now. Okay makes lot sense.   experimented trials try different regimes look effective whether confusing not, actually found beneficial regime actually helps people get first doses faster. Presumably many regulators satisfied results approved it. Real world data also showing effective is.

 get AZ made mistakes there's lot hyperbole around think trials 'disaster' data somehow invalid, like PR disaster. everyone choice around vaccines drama around AZ is, longer we'll worldwide pandemic. still won’t matter people get medical exemption vaccine due “religious reasons” ready summer kids 12-15 years old. Great. need vaccinate people work congregate settings, matter status. Vaccinations way get pandemic. less 'Reddit weird' 'people stupid' really, person classes literally one except teacher vaccinated. one covid entire semester. don’t read quote whole article, “actual numbers.” 

I won’t hold breath won’t fit personal agenda. I'm getting first shot tomorrow!!!! county opened 16+ last week, manager book appointment yesterday! 

I'm wondering much I'll affected fatigue. curious see fatigue compares 1st trimester pregnancy fatigue. :D *in one day Vaccinated people 0% transmission dude, plus still get sick cases. Every old person gets hospital right takes space time costs society. Also apparently fine still pose risk me, even smaller. 

I asking wait month two everyone gets chance, wasted 14 months mine. much it. following state mandated lockdown I'm vaccinated, tell that.

I suspect summer tipping point majority decide go back normal behaviors.  already happening reporting polls increasingly going eat, flying, planning vacations, socially distancing, etc. It’s broadly, it’s personally you’re fully vaccinated.

His dad misinformed. lot people are. hate people say everything open. Maybe never left house seems like link work. may want repost following URL: IMO necessarily good sign demand starting fall we're 30-35% vaccinated. follow guidelines get state red go Florida anywhere tropical party please nice wake got Pfizer Jabs finish fight reprimand vacationing anymore probably going happen 2022.

I talking somebody day vaccine, basically fear. “The vaccine doesn’t work 1 20 people. every time go place 20 people, even everyone vaccinated, you’re around somebody still infect you. really risk want take?” almost pulled hair rude someone who's asking question? people know things terminally online constantly check every update. Chill correct saying people opposed vaccination passports social media accounts carry around smartphone thing they're concerned about? 1. main benefit mRNA vaccines ability quickly reliably develop/test/produce new vaccines. 
2. 6 vaccines currently use 2 mRNA based. 
3. likely fully approved end year. 
4. mRNA vaccines, Zika virus particular.
5. Stop calling ""therapy"", vaccines coming online now, going definitively prove that"".

If studies question going 'definitively prove that', necessary thing continue?

Or maybe, maybe, know?

What happens science *doesn't* support it? society vaccine prevent spreading? feel ya. I’m two weeks away second shot home last year (while doesn’t seem been).

At exactly 3 weeks post shot #2, I’ll also done restrictions. Literally breaking point. Osterholm quack. Yeah posted wrong extremist. Sorry that. Support getting life back normal? failure lies number doses produced (or rather failed produce). 
 
The vaccine intended main vaccine EU, delivered time would likely case. Instead Pfizer/BioNTech deliver several times amount doses AZ does. think saw Finland getting 80k+/week Pfizer/BioNTech vs 10-13k / week AZ. 
 
It would peoples arms, could produce it. Babies children two can’t wear masks, genius. flu deadly covid? Vaccination people affect susceptibility dying disease, affects susceptibility infection.

You're right, adults vaccinated, would cut level covid deaths, but

1) majority adults currently vaccinated, originally said ""when vaccine available everyone."" I'm actually agreeing you, actually read I'm saying. vaccine available adults, feel risk mitigated point move on.

2) question posed article ""are kids reservoir virus?"" kids reservoir, every unvaccinated parent danger contracting covid, amount herd immunity protect them, kids vaccinated. Yeah quite conservative say least. OP understand they’re coming from. went dental cleaning late summer kept hearing low risk, everyone careful, etc. felt super unsafe two patients without masks waiting room. also kept seeing staff yank masks talk people. Granted, didn’t get sick, guess lucky. haven’t back I’m months past due another cleaning now. New Jersey fucking messed can't even get medically ill people vaccinated. Texas declining covid hospitalizations deaths 3 weeks listing mask mandate. people getting tested spreading actually-covid-not-allergies everyone around them, hospitalizations deaths declining. Water wet yesterday. dont know today... Parents protecting children making risk-informed decision let live lives face disease accounts far less deadly flu. asinine proposition. myopia kind point. conversation steeped ""well spreading rapidly B117 vaccine neutralizes that"" talk.

This really great news majority world third/fourth wave rapidly accelerating right now. Stop spewing narrative please. single country Earth back normal. 250 covid deaths among children maximum safety measures: lockdowns, remote schools, social distancing, masks, on. many deaths predict without safety measures? 25? 250? 2500? 25000? One player officially reinfected. Here’s quote: “Postmedia confirmed Hawryluk indeed positive case, meaning second time he’s tested positive COVID-19. one handful Ottawa Senators caught virus shortly 2019-20 season went pause last March. Research shown P.1 variant capable reinfecting people previously suffered strains coronavirus causes COVID-19.” least admire surgeons handwork paid Irish taxpayers..... And, turn, I’m kind disturbed people kept life nothing wrong, despite public health guidance telling stop health. Well specifically SA variant it’s SA bet big AZ’s vaccine proven effectively useless variant. fact remains seen AZ vaccinated countries handle SA variant coming year. almost killed months ago high school student, fucking survive two months. Lol everyone downvoting least there’s light end tunnel you. goal work toward now. wait second shot + two weeks... treat yourself. Take date. Go restaurant you’ve dying eat again, go clothes shopping buy something nice, go get hair nails done/have spa day. Invite friends (who’ve also vaccinated) come along. 

Spend time make day/days/week/weeks scheduling you’re going do. Make big deal yourself. wear mask respectful, happy knowing you’re pretty much clear second shot.

Give something look forward to. We’re sick pandemic, there’s actually finish line persevered. self-isolating crap, day day end sight. don’t worry steering clear anti-maskers anti-vaxxers too. Let dodge Covid bullets go life normal fashion.

You’re almost there! Keep good work. You’ve made fucking far everything want within reach. Don’t take unnecessary risks you’re close. Pfizer executive said ready Fall, time school. saw Face Nation morning. We’ve tested three vaccines tens millions people hardly adverse effects, Pfizer recently reported 100% efficacy kids young 12. think magical vaccine gremlin going kill 5 year olds nothing like happened age groups? Thousands going die needlessly unvaccinated kids infect adults wait full bureaucracy work out. business walking away job age responsibilities (read bills) never wanted sell everything walk away bit right now. Yes, said vaccines approved FDA? Virtual learning makes sense college classes

Agree there. think problem we're they're still trying teach virtual classes way would teach person.


I took online classes college 10 years ago, different in-person classes. Zoom meetings taped lectures...it pretty much list readings assignments date submit things by. works well things like that. idea trying prove.  save doctors ER putting otherwise healthy 30 year old ventilator contracted variant strain. don’t feel bad them, you’d support reams science says it’s safe classroom. Especially point pandemic medical professionals likely vaccinated. Unless they’ve chosen be, case, find new dentist. yet post saying article Fauci saying kids keep wearing masks reads comments 180 here. makes sense. figured us would 2022. fact vaccine early awesome. somehow think Canadians tolerate Wuhan-style military lockdown ppl test positive literally dragged quarantine covid camps. sad fact given rampant spread especially contagious strains can't really control case counts half measures. either lockdown entire economy fully 2 3 months roll vaccine doses half population. UK taken strategies degree success. need tweak Trump quotes make sound dumb. many? 18 players 3 coaches. AHL affiliate, Utica Comets, 10 players COVID protocol. Reportedly, family members also tested positive. “Potentially less likely” 

They’re sure. director CDC walk back comments vaccinated people can’t carry Covid. science still done. people impatient naturally hear want hear done it. need quit job think zoom school anything harming kids. Shit man. I’m Canuck Idk people keep freaking SA strand. averaging 1000 new cases day 60 million population, lowest months. Doug Ford's approach ... weird seemingly arbitrary/random times. go full Kenney, approaches really dumb. 

Let's forget next election responsible lot nursing home deaths since rolled back regulations. Deaths, always lagging indicator, conversation long term health effects, especially given new spikes hospitalizing younger younger cohorts.

I don’t think COVID end world, it’s height wishful thinking believe we’re vaccinating adults teens handful rich countries. P1 variant already demonstrating antibody escape increased potential reinfection came again? Oh right, Brazil, won’t herd-immunity level vaccination place time (not mention become ever difficult target mutations increased transmissibility keep getting selected for). Unless vaccine IP patents broken shared poorer countries, escape variant emerge everywhere bite us ass. ""just hang bit longer""

You've saying fucking year. soon reach current goal, they're going move damn posts AGAIN. I'm shit. states inevitably pass laws prevent businesses denying access based vaccination status. something basically sure happen certain states  Dont feed troll. guy shit everywhere Additionally, a growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely asymptomatic infection potentially less likely transmit SARS-CoV-2 others. still listening fauci, that's know. !remindme April 2022 still never C19 healthcare worker. Tested 3 times negative. Never symptoms. Got doses vaccine recently. Really wondering fuck even happened past year so. Makes feel like everything lie, even though I've seen victims virus person. makes sense. less understanding works began. I've exposed times count I've never even gotten antibody C19 That's true, matter tech savvy teacher/student is, still can't provide aspects schooling. 1 1 help, recess students, seeing talking friends....all sorts. Plus lots kids can't/won't pay attention even show virtual classes. Nope. possible. really true Japan/SK/Vietnam/China open business, lockdowns, cases low? get it. Yes know 99% wearing mask everyday that's good, there's way mask wearing alone would keep covid cases low. 

Are good sources English explain Eastern Asia done well despite minimal lockdowns? fact fatigue guess. Us adults too. college University student, one year left here. transferred paying lot, already missed whole year making memories &amp; connections. I've thinking same. mask data available pandemic? Y'all fools.

Got it. “Though risk disease may minimal fully vaccinated person themselves, mindful potential risk transmitting virus others become infected, especially visiting unvaccinated people increased risk severe illness COVID-19 unvaccinated people increased risk severe disease households.” anyone know number cases going Texas? lifted mask mandate weeks ago they're well vaccinations per capita. hotter there? equivalent things. like every kid goes school, even significant percentage them, parents die covid. live 40 minutes East Cuse, cheers!

Time move rage hysteria next one Cause Italy nicked last time, kinda puts downer getting internationally Illiterate going high school? can’t blamed solely closing schools Covid. Obviously Covid hasn’t helped, [there problem literacy well Wrong. movie made slightly more:

 United States Canada, Godzilla: King Monsters released alongside projected gross $55–65 million 4,108 theaters opening film made $19.6 million first day, including $6.3 million Thursday night previews, lower $9.3 million made 2014 film *Kong: Skull Island*'s $3.7 million. went debut $47.8 million, finishing first weekend box office expectations. Virtual/hybrid learning 100% won't. Every single teacher know hates model virtual learning see's (justified) necessity time. kids hate able socialize friends. 

WFH, least hybrid, agree that. hope does. old you? you’re 50 go party little risk. **WE LIKE VACCINE** really difficult one parent stay home. difficult started planning parents work pandemic forced change plans, I'm sure global pandemic causing troubles ""indictment economic system"". i’m going advocate keep kids home next year without reason, legitimate reason that, surely we’d enough vaccinated adults people could safely in-home child-care. needs subsidized funds would otherwise spent schools directly could worked out. take enough money taxes whole help citizens times crisis, problem spend money things. live 40 minutes East, cheers! literally states exactly said looking likely vaccinated people cannot spread Covid. Mine 11 May. So....does mean STILL school next year? Cause....I need actually go building. bit much family time year. likely good 4-8 hours anything might happen. big issue plan dead doesn’t = totally fine. understand you’re trying get looking numbers removing morality aspect, I’ve seen studies coming saying 10-30% people long haul symptoms / permanent damage heart, lungs, kidney, etc. Even people mild cases issues. Plus mentioned, hospitals would’ve gotten overwhelmed would’ve run higher risk mutation. know LA got point, even California’s lockdowns, hospitals denying patients entry full. Also Sweden didn’t lockdown all, govt came said hindsight wrong move due listed reasons vaccine invented Netherlands

If buy corporate propaganda. reality, academic researchers around world developed technology decades Big Pharma simply cherry picked final 0.01% research needed develop vaccine. took Moderna literally two days develop vaccine. rest testing approval. Producing end vaccine candidate really big deal. wish people would stop acting like pharmaceutical companies single handedly saved world. world needed manufacturing expertise. commended financially rewarded. Dr. Gottlieb thinks 200m Americans protected covid going easy 16+ person US get vaccine end May latest. fucked there's unvaccinated people could easily become infected enclosed space? 'passport' says okay, we're vaccinated. We're good. get flu, stay home anti makers (idiots), 

Irony. Yeah, found that. say Merck agree sell profit. dispute percent royalties Oxford receives. Astrazeneca gives Oxford 6% royalties, Merck proposed 1% (all royalties, course, pandemic over, per agreement sell profit pandemic). feel like doctors feel sense urgency get shit with

I wish quote something like could stickied top sub. want follow science too, want stuck perpetual holding pattern diminishing returns. 

By acting sense urgency, health officials giving cover people politicians reckless. find problem there's 1 boss small number employees. create work you. there's single boss several dozen people though, they're usually busy create pointless work meetings. They're help, much deal create unnecessary work.  US government facility, emergent put charge it: evidence safest place breezy, sunny beach, despite press constantly showing people beaches evidence people taking undue risks. end day, people need ask they'd willing sacrifice save someone's life. 

Yes absolutely it’s extent. extent vaccinated. vaccines didn’t work gave honest shot  sacrificing life elderly. 

Now vaccinated met moral ethical obligations. I’m going back normal pushing representatives open soon vaccines widely available. makes think Hispanic Asian don’t fall “race, color, national origin”? said, far vaccine rollout speeds, think raw number doses far important. Ultimately, getting millions doses huge country enormous population harder shows much ""achievement"" seen Germany.

So Israel worse Germany, right?
 country like Germany world-leading infrastructure highest GDP EU rolling doses waaay faster India.

The limiting factor Germany infrastructure availability vaccines availability vaccines limited global supply chain. Germany could vaccinated people significant manner EU would ban export vaccines case people UK, Canada, Israel etc would fewer doses case ocuntries might retaliate disrupting global supply means everybody loses.

Of course could say US people retaliate. Yikes. People overworked complain delegate frustrate hell me. They're hoarding work, complaining, holding people back progressing skills. usually older people too. I'm sure get blame project gets held lead. I'd create paper trail boss let know much think moved different project. sea? So, waterboarding? Wtf? I'm looking forward mine well, I'm scheduled 12th. Idk adverse allergic reaction kind. There’s news articles floating around social media since vaccines made available public that’s I’m kinda scared back mind. fact government made vaping much harder expensive might something mean social distancing guidelines go musical sporting event, dine restaurant, go dancing.

you say local bar changed business type club charge $1 membership fee het around capacity limits. Place packed non maskers Noooo! must remain terrified. Deaths really much, vaccine still effective preventing serious illness, people stop scared they're harder control. Please. Continue indulge fear porn. What’s helping constantly moving goalposts constant talk nothing changes get vaccine..

The goalposts far been:
1. Two weeks slow spread hospitals overwhelmed
2. Lockdown prevent deaths
3. Lockdown prevent cases
4. Restrictions vaccine available
5. Restrictions know vaccine works asymptomatic spread variants

People think prolong reason.. like kids vaccinated something “The Sydney airport 49th busiest airport earth score pandemic”

Bro, know BUSIEST, like number one busiest, airport Earth is??? It’s fucking Atlanta, Georgia.

You’re talking 49th like means something 💀  March absolute worst month covid far, forget prediction part, yes. things still taste right. Regular Coca Cola tastes like rotten fruit. people refusing vaccine really strike type would follow restrictions, lol. 80% first dose, tested period dose 1 dose 2 - test people skipped second dose.

Still, think protects enough relax bit first one (but obviously still take precautions)  possible. Schools staying open needs top comment. lockdown freely move 10km residence.😂 shit excuse free country. We're already allowed stop we've vaccinated Sorry hear that. I’m stuck Ontario Ford. He’s nightmare. crashed car ditch he’d find way blame Trudeau (not saying Trudeau perfect, clear). Everyone enabled receive vaccine likely June, Pfizer 12+ data way. Also, full FDA approval anticipated summer fall. Thus, colleges requiring anticipate sectors require it. 

Stupidity isn’t excuse moving forward, applies pretty much every single anti vaccine rhetoric According states statutes practice, legally allowed disclose vaccination status advertisement practice. quote states dental society. 

One important rule written [state] statute pertains characterize safety practice, especially comparison dental offices. dentist cannot “[take] advantage potential client’s fears [or] anxieties.” Although may every member staff vaccinated, avoid advertising such. Setting practice apart “safer” manner illegal. state shouldn’t make people get vaccines aren’t even approved FDA. best news today's report states highest concern demand saturation showed healthy volumes. Mississippi, Wyoming, even Alaska strong days. 

Hopefully last hurrah states. definitely nationwide dip Easter Sunday many vaccination facilities (public private) closed create drag 7-day moving average next week. got lucky dropped regular high school 90's went continuation school next door 16 students. California schools got decent budget allocation grants technology. tiny continuation school ended getting relatively large tech budget compared full size schools. student computer digital cameras, digital video cameras, Macromedia software etc. ended taking online programming courses local college class awarded high school college credit it. unit fees reimbursed high school passing grades. great. similar death rates, all, covid far contagious. Soeder show better chancellor material Laschet. getting numbers? 90% effective Covid 97% effective hospitalization, would mean 30% folks get virus vaccinated get hospitalized. Unless talking addition 97% effectiveness top 90%.  would overall efficacy 99.7% hospitalization. Vaccinated people die. People already likely die.

At point, goalposts moved far mean return normal covid eradicated, seems like saying, I'm going say fuck it, I'd rather live life. Life sucks, people die. We're good spot there's lot good news. realistic goal, nobody going give fuck. I'd rather die live like covid gone, going away completely. teeth cleaned twice since last March. dentist hygienist wore PPE even prior COVID felt pretty confident. also called asked safety procedures like. consider health checkups high priority that’s concentrated on. really want get hair properly cut! Right. Every teacher know outside school - let's modest say 10. saying nearly universal kids. definitely entire school 650. let's put I'm speaking 1500 kids ranging 4 districts NC.

But I'm really glad daughter excelling we've learned anecdotal evidence. Slovenia here, fucked similar level, whole EU shite right think doctors intentionally lie patients issues health?

-OP probably point I'm trying make 6 10,000 people testing positive extremely low number. past year exposed lot people great statistics. times, helps point actual dangers. read numbers still wish hide basement, begrudge wish greatest success endeavors. Vaccinations increasing, great news, there's still ways go that. States still expanding eligibility, we're woods yet. Meanwhile, lot people (and states) seem hear good news think we're totally clear, relax social distancing, etc, even they're vaccinated. result another increase cases. Literally this. I’m UK lockdown starting ease, want see people again... also want able say went pandemic managed avoid catching far tell. shouldn’t long get vaccine it’s energy wait little longer I’m struggling with, mind take much patience. Last summer, estimates would vaccine summer 2021. many good vaccines quickly miracle.

People today expect instant gratification. Everything available abundant quantity immediately supermarket shelve. Never many vaccines produced quickly. ""I think enough research MMR vaccine whether causes autism think wait facts"" definitely utilized much easily teacher popping student's desk raise hand.

That's entirely teacher's fault then, unless they're using weird software allow break rooms like Zoom. software they're using allow teachers use individual rooms away main session talk students needed, different going desk need help. ideal, work interim. 

Like said, I'm suggesting things full replacements. starting stretch (or already has) long term territory.

That's dependent outlook things. believe year long-term, especially good chunk summer vacation 2020. clearly see vaccination positive effect viral spread, see safer period sight things keep trending way - assuming variant spiral control - idea can't hang little longer silly me. Yeah, same, many people, livelihood others important someone's preference hang people person. 

Although said, nothing stopping people hanging person, even unvaccinated, long remain outdoors, masked, 6 ft. apart. friends past year without issue. past months we've informal outside team meetings, questions asked answered problems solved 1 year Teams meetings.

Even sent kids school person, still able socialize much, take risk?  Well guess what? didn't. please quit whining it, whole year now. smoking doubled since February 2020. I've left home exactly three times past year, medically related. Oops--it's *four* times 19 March, got first Moderna dose. I'll ""fully vaccinated"" 30 April, two weeks second dose.

Kinda annoying think lot places opened person schooling. Prior that, kids virtual learning, probably community much. Yeah, patient free go different dentist office transparent vaccination status. Free market work Well understand perspective lot people tend tell headline stories perspective analysis, stating facts. social platform. However, people post legit news stories social platform spread awareness. think boils everyone’s individual responsibility research, one wants take time research anymore. post articles agree with. done sooner. open schools, bars, nightclubs already...

I live SF it’s mess right imo. restrictions made worse spot live. Crime shot up, see weekly muggings, many businesses gone good, many people left city, unclear reopening plan. 

And CA performing slightly better Florida covid cases wise. Florida wide open since summer Florida much older population.... Proud country. Let’s end this! joke me? Sorry, it’s gone head. China still needs pay reparations disaster caused. rate vaccine hesitancy, different anti-vaxxers, going significantly, anti-vaxxers seem pretty firm beliefs Yes, done that. Nothing improve resemblance normalcy returns. Right. HIT younger people? get percentage vaccine group.

Let's say 100 people vaccine group 100 control group. Presumably, mask rate.

2 people vaccine group got sick, 18 people control group got sick.

That means 20 total people got sick.
2÷20=.10=10%.
So vaccine 90% effective.

You get effectiveness dividing sick vaccinated group total sick. might matter many others. I’d like University adore maintain brand prestige opening campuses sake money. No, I'm making joke No, I'm making joke whole family tested positive end January, wife two daughters ages 10 5. nothing runny nose 8 hours, two kids asymptomatic, wife lose taste smell 5 days she’s perfectly fine now. 42. got bamboozled! Two weeks open 18+. think actually smarter us Mass tiered approach still. Another person commented competitiveness getting vaccine. Seeing virus affects older people think much smarter vulnerable population compete much younger unaffected age groups. Whether 55 right age knows.  going long way around idea months masks distancing taking about.

Like said, doesn’t help kind ELE event hands, that’s bigger problem.   Hoping get another 4M+ update today. Im biggest hater soviet union could find. Im pointing internal passports used communist goverment end ideological end clear.People baited notion freedom freedoms bad anyways without need passports. look market passport . risk probably 80+ percent. I’ve guy. authority tell private business allow can’t. pretends advocating freedom—unless it’s “freedom” business owner disagrees ignorance facts political agenda. call fear, call sense responsibility others. I’m probably fine - I’ve vaccinated. don’t want conscience turn rare case still get mild case give someone hasn’t able access vaccine yet.  One dose Pfizer. Sore arm— worse tetanus shot need every pregnancy. Extra tired next day. helping fishies battle covid. Almost. Except it’s happened. Yes chance get test instead apparently. Note nobody ever provides baseline hospital utilization. It’s never close 0% normal times denial variants including PHD deleting posts mean exist major threat. Keep upvoting other's ignorance. Even mighty USA vaccine rollout fast enough without proper restrictions place, exactly federal government even president telling weeks already governors fail listen. Again, nothing first headline vilifies AstraZeneca. 

Regarding media; shouting wolf create one there. Yes MSM part play sensationalism yellow journalism. need learn read lines. Unfortunately, plethora “news” it’s hard find true add together, fits logic.

Remember follow advise Sherlock Holmes - “When eliminated impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must truth”

Good night good luck! Excess deaths number deaths average year. getting vaccinated intentionally spreading disease lmao True way limit liabilities. Why? (The Danishn Corona passport includes test's vaccines - assume UK) heard people talk getting fake IDs birthday later year, think shortest amount time heard someone debating getting one month. think ended it. friends know sure Thank you. somebody who's family suffered soviet rule, please compare this, similar guess didn’t read article. already said main vector, kids.
