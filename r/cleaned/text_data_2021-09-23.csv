Can't remember melody though. Danish government, authorities independent expert seem agree hold, see rising numbers eventually. question much. expressed big worry flu RS-virus combined even moderate rise Covid amongst children cause serious problems children hospitals etc. 

Hopefully means prepared act it, far don’t seem proactive. There’s big issue schools kindergarten half unvaxxed DK kids &lt;12 y.o. currently nothing done limit spread airborne virus.

But solid system testing contact tracing clearly saved us spring, scaled test 10% population per day. Bodily autonomy apply body expels something affects everyone around you. Coughing/sneezing virus particles make others seriously ill kill longer you. someone HIV knowingly infects someone charged attempted murder. entire argument pointless.

You want vaccine? Fine, go hide rock somewhere harm anyone else. exactly it. Great explanation. people trying apply nothing thinking vaccines, much nuanced that. think trust say think best slowing epidemic. hindsight, turned long term mistake speak frankly masks masks short supply. trust issue bring up. Anti-vaxxers like hear CDC, point flip-flopping. vaccinated people like they're hearing, thing.

I would challenge find flaw CDC's reasoning saw Provincetown. Clusters vaccinated people common occurences. still need wear masks.  really thinking people kiss last one half years? think need re-read definition pandemic :

“A pandemic epidemic infectious disease spread across large region, instance multiple continents worldwide, affecting substantial number people. “

We definitely still pandemic vaccine:

1. Massively reduces chances get COVID first place. Like, lot. lot lot. huge amount. 
2. Massive reduces chances give COVID someone else
3. Almost totally prevents needing go hospital get it.

In order.  Nobody ignoring side effects. incredibly cautiously tracked logged whenever irregularities happen. vaccine mandates ignore legitimate medical exemptions. certain individuals recommended get certain vaccines like J&amp;J blood clotting issue combined certain hormonal birth controls. It’s probably even simple that. Vaccines less effective people. Hence need protect getting vaccinated.  Masks work depends mask using

It also depends mean 'work'.

While many masks may offer complete protection wearer, give protection infected wearer - thus reduce infections. joke, but… well… important, I've heard many people say thing prevent serious illness, true Californians masking everywhere even, part, outdoors. vax rate remained flat ~50%ile fully vaxed cpl months now. must masking making difference. Fucking give already. I’m American care Original New Mexican people. Live Southern California years enjoy beautiful culture peeps South Central America bring U.S. 

And remember immigrants point. Compassion helps see people trying make better life themselves. Never late removing people's bodily autonomy.

Do also think women bodily autonomy?

Do think entitled privacy?

All name ""saving vulnurable""

Oh conveniency.

And indefinite attitude towards issue; ""we"". give shit want do, leave fuck alone, let decide want own.

If could die covid can't get vaccine, could die flu pneumonia. change laws bodily autonomy protect before, now. danger, stay inside.  gg kids.

CARE'S ... quite proactive regards boosters - already administered half care home residents. looks like health care workers elderly people next.

I’m impressed. Care home residents small proportion risk groups. People chronic lung disease, cancer patient, multiple sclerosis, dysfunctional immune systems, etc, currently living risky life. Even school aged kids spend days packed classrooms without disease control measures. Upvoting ""Meal Team Six"" Yes healthcare capacity issues pay nurses well. work overseas rich country really save lot take back home improve lives. Covid tried block leaving oveseas many happy protested. video talks bit it. really sad issue going getting vaccines arms. Covax donators generally see responsibility delivering doses country's major airports. Covax recipients generally expecting help that, pointing medical staff currently overworked unable give vaccines, necessarily infrastructure store transport vaccines safe timely manner, money get vaccine everywhere needs go.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  things unpack here.

First, people *cant* get vaccine. less myth. mRNA vaccines like traditional vaccines not-insignificant percentage population may allergic unable receive it.

Second, thinking immunocompromised people vaccine may work on, everywhere vaccine mandate also showing negative testing alternative option. cases people really immunocompromised pretending, would think they'd... know... care that. Catching COVID likely means hospital stint maybe death. yeah think probably take seriously.

Finally, someone thinks getting ""banned society"", odds good they're kind person engaging kind behavior got us place begin with. Remember even two week lockdown without ""banned society"" people storming capitol buildings? Yeah, empathy now- literal year half later.

So yes, extra testing suck 10 people can't get vaccine. millions refuse, well, choice live consequences actions.  Northern Idaho you’re health care worker don’t trust science behind vaccine experts backing it, probably shouldn’t working health care. Lol I'm going argue you. I'll agree you. recommendations based pure science, instead poorly executed balancing act based group psychology, business interests, perceived scarcity. 

Remember last year early summer studies came said airborne spread want admit it, admitted one weekend quietly, took went back saying surface/close contact/droplet spread? Pepperidge farm remembers. know people allergic nuanced thought, broad statement like would seem validate people say ""Dr. Demon Sperm might right vaccine deadly.""

There *is* thing expert consensus listened followed. difference policy questions science questions, within science questions issues weight credibility.

When CDC, FDA, first rate subject matter experts like Dr. Fauci agreeing something, that's something disagree hey maybe fringe wackos error ridden papers right answer all. appears Moderna, followed closely Pfizer. Norwegian here. proud country. Thanks got vaccinated made possible.  Ultimately youre immune suppressed LOT diseases could easily kill you. never going able protect everybody every disease best protect many people much possible. I'm watching news right now. Health care workers teachers get booster. Almost religions ok it. It’s anti-vaxxers exploiting first amendment trying get bullshit exemption obscure religion never even belonged job told needed vaccine.  I'm US really fit happens there.

Just tried give educated guess **he** hinted at.

You may well right wrote, reddit full misinformation.   Well I'm certainly glad told take precautions COVID cases spread sufficiently catastrophic level. want get ahead ourselves. Covered II. Efficacy infections.  And?

Compare like like - vaccinated person symptoms Vs vaccinated person without symptoms. think spreads more?

My point simply virus predominantly asymptomatic nature spreads more, else equal. fact. caused virus. never get rid chicken pox. sometimes reactivates immune system weakens causes shingles. grandparents sometime 85. 

That said, chicken pox older adults deadly. parents would go way make sure got it.  Comparatively, bad children. still posing danger around us carrying guns

No, people simply pose dangers simply existing, guns don’t cause this.  Good question!

You think virus disease two separate entities. vaccine nothing prevent virus getting body. train immune system respond threat much faster hopefully kill virus chance replicate itself.

You get disease virus body high enough numbers long enough time. training immune system respond faster, becomes likely either completely eliminate virus even experience symptoms, even develop symptoms, less severe last long unvaccinated. (Having natural immunity previous infection generally works too) can't ""simply"" that. That's policy works elected official overruling CDC far terrible optics situation health expert overruling narrow vote align rest experts.

The president absolutely overruling CDC medical issues telling healthcare providers ignore law, requires CDC authorization. one hospital system around puts weekly facebook post number people covid hospital system whether vaccinated unvaccinated. usually couple people ventilators vaccinated 95%+ unvaccinated. last week think 280 hospital 20 vaccinated. 38 icu, unvaccinated, 30 ventilators (obviously unvaccinated). you’re required disclose considered immunocompromised; can’t ask information CDC/FDA requesting forms.  ""get covid protect covid"" supposed make sense? Holy Sh!t. September 2021 20 months Pandemic still people thinking like You. Incredible!!

After long still escaped attention yes statistically speaking demographic likely mild (technically mild case require hospitalisation ranges sniffles sickest ever felt 1-2 weeks short needing go hospital) asymptomatic case, still magnitudes greater risk bad fatal case Covid19 risk vaccination itself. problem know catch Virus kind statistic demographic be. 

Yeah, maybe someone youth got exposed several/all endemic Cold causing Coronaviruses meant B Memory cells recognised surface expressed proteins SarsCov2 infection replication thus rendered asymptomatic original Alpha/beta variants immune system headstart virus major replication started. (Much higher viral loads Delta outpace even immunity though meaning greater chance symptoms immune system could get ahead virus). infection taught body recognise actual SarsCov2 Spike Protein creating specific anti-body protection even targetted B Memory cells.

For example, reckon 47 year old working retail behind register convenience store serving hundreds day every day entire pandemic never much sniffle. I've constantly exposed every respiratory infection known man repeatedly working life likely encountered endemic coronaviruses relevant B cells. Guess though..... **I still got 2 shots Pfizer soon cohort allowed because...why not?? took 1 hour day pin-prick even feel sides mildly achy arm injection site 36 hours**

Guess though! Maybe actually someone got plenty colds kid happened several 100 Rino/Adeno/RSV Cold causing viruses happen someone never encountered 4 5 cold causing coronaviruses. immune system headstart variants. Add that, maybe one people 'Young Healthy' immune system 'powerful' prone immune system reaction called Cytokine Storm. second wave Spanish/Kentucky Flu 2018 primarily killed millions Young healthy people. exposed previous related flu decades earlier like older folks offered protection/immune headstart, died Cytokine Storms immune system over-reacted attacked body.

I actually know local bar owner lucky alive...twice.... put coma ventilator Swine Flu decade ago Covid19 Summer 2020 prone Cytokine Storms!! lungs likely %^&amp;$ed despite surviving he'll lucky reach get 60's cause next bad case Flu respiratory infection lung issue likely kill him.

**So I'll ask again, TF take vaccine thats incredible effective, incredibly safe, takes hour 2 days several weeks apart, pin prick even feel (trust me, needle apprehensive dislike even tiny pinch much thicker gauge blood draw needles. vaccine needle thin even feel it, feel vaccinators hand shoulder), unlikely cause side effects mildly achey upper arm 36 hours vast majority people.**

Like WTF Dude!!

You know absolute best protection is? Vaccination virtually guarantee's asymptomatic truly mild (not medical definition mild) case, teaches body recognise Virus Spike Protein without risking triggering Cytokine Storm order achieve recognition. protection enhanced actually encountering real Virus cells virus manages replicate vaccine trained immune system blows away, enough create specific surfaced expressed proteins B Memory cells learn recognise. **Congratulations**, know immune system recognises actual Virus Spike Protein created anti-bodies **as well as** B memory cells recognise expressed proteins infection. Every encounter virus thereafter enhances boosts anti-body protection. think would better spent sent poorer nations tho. Well that’s nice. Ask genuine question, get insulted. ""Science evolves, makes distrust science!"" Vaccinated people clear virus system much quickly unvaccinated people, they’re *still* less contagious unvaccinated people. That’s absolutely true 😂 Never thought would get emotional politician folding scale back indicate 1 meter policy removed. also almost cried national TV now.  


To say Norway excited, understatement. sad thing going fuel anti-vaxxers. 1 1000 number pretty high.

Basically world needs team scientists (from world)to come together hold press conference. Explain community vaccine important. Getting info different guidance government officials broken feeling 100 students kind people missed anyone. like term breakthrough infection claim vaccine designed tested prevent infection -- severe disease death. wish way could keep track kind arrogance check see get HCA. misunderstand risks/odds feel fine putting others risk, honest it.

BTW people claim ""never"" around others risky context full shit. Nobody exclusively outdoors 24/7 even rural area. point go bathroom, shop, home many people it, youre choosing mention bolster argument. addition patently false ""can't"" catch anything outdoors, still obviously can--its greatly reduced likelihood.

You really nothing lose, could get done quickly secure help others instead youre choosing fake big brained route. Good luck may never combat thing, may arrogance fuck anyone else over. vaccinated months ago. Currently covid luckily bad. glad took vaccine usually wear mask. could worse am. daughter got covid last year, serious, got vaccinated year. would rather safe dead hospitalized. Alaska ""biggest"" state population smaller Metropolitan Lisbon, capital Portugal. meant small population size, Portugal would 10th populous US state someone pointed out. Alaska's population 731k yet population fully vaxxed 49.7%. Using argument since Alaska ""small"" close 90% now. guess what, ain't. 

And please, shit country, paper saying great sunshine food is. demeaning. stupid people filtered out. Covid stupidity filter. must least intelligent survive. Problem they're logically assessing risk Shouldn’t slept basic biology class. think hold different media outlets accountable well. far many willing release sensationalized articles without proper research understanding topic completely. can, would personally space week apart reaction know vaccine caused it, even it’s sore arm. 

That’s though, feel comfortable with. ;-)

TWiV they're almost always talking severe disease death careful make distinction. measure really declining. think they've recently disputed infection declining. said infections vaccinated people usually less severe, less likely symptomatic, clear quicker. forget 5-11 group going lower dose grip wilfully unvaccinated persons steadily tightens.

Unless course means exempt foisting unvaccinated sick butt hospital systems. believe science, cure home prayers horse paste. COVID (COrona VIrus Disease) disease caused specific virus SARS-CoV-2 able overwhelm immune system.

Maybe analogy would work? SARS-CoV-2 like club arsonists. body immune system full tools prevent this, like police firefighters. arsonists light enough matches get raging uncontrollable COVID forest fire. long body track extinguish matches ignite trees. goal matches light something fire big enough sustain overwhelm fire department.

The virus club roster, description matches look like, plan attack next. let immune system practice ahead time, see arsonists show up, catch quickly prevent damage, start damage put quickly already time practice know do. time people die covid vaccinated. people vaccinated.

What's important proportion unvaccinated several times likely die get sick. Vaccinations prevent deaths, lot people still going die despite vaccinated.

It's also important realize people (older ones, sick ones, special medications) develop good response vaccination. people need protect protected others. What? even start hearing arguments Dec 1st. Thats extremely fast turnaround Supreme court, usually stuff get heard years. Reddit putting cart horse one. Anyone *can* issue people *won't* think qualify qualify break rules. I've passionate *I* want booster, already said immunocompromised got one, family, there's important public health reasons maximizing protection important. also know, thanks massive studies done Israel Cleveland, unvaccinated people 2700% (Israel) better (Cleveland) two pfizer shots.

&amp;#x200B;

It important remember this. unvaccinated exponentially superior protection covid without vaccine, far less likely carry disease spread others. 

&amp;#x200B;

The vaccine still important since many risk disease cannot afford chance gain superior natural immunity, right/wrong answer everyone. Trying put one size fits approach problem foolhardy, ignores recent definitive scientific information available :).   Big Risk take might even get immunity infection. I've linked PR department health. site breaks ton PR covid stats. However, brought attention PR health department also posts daily update official Facebook page, tells people died covid day. However, breaks deaths two groups: unvaccinated deaths, vaccinated deaths.

As I'm sure know, world seeing incredibly low rates covid deaths among vaccinated people. However, according health department's daily updates, different story Puerto Rico. 

Most days, almost HALF people died covid vaccinated. makes sense, lot Puerto Ricans, besides upset nobody seems addressing even talking this, suspect may due improper refrigeration covid vaccines PR, resulting people receiving would essentially expired vaccines.

Sweet Jesus there's quite revival happening Israel done it, [those experienced prior infections 27 times less likely get second symptomatic covid infection caring peoples well being, still transmit virus vaccinated. purely power grab dividing population strip liberties people oppose politically. reason get vaccine protect yourself. people want protect that's business, need vaccine younger healthy person especially overweight. decision make. go get booster. know several friends walked Walgreens said immunocompromised. don’t prove anything. 

Nothing wrong protecting yourself. government isn’t it. Thank this! keep wondering would qualify. do!! thing required saying high risk group.  getting ill eating that? Like immediately after? absolutely nothing stopping getting booster. say one risk groups, questions asked. course—hasn’t always policy? double dose Pfizer basically nothing prevent getting sick. YES, KNOW NEVER OFFICIAL REASON VACCINATE

Upvoted think it’s great comment, add clarity point. Symptomatic infection primary endpoint analysis Pfizer Moderna vaccines initial trials. don’t know idea vaccines meant keep hospital started, certainly important, it’s vaccines do. Fair enough, heard also keeping intensely lately.

I wonder it'll swing back towards permissiveness underlying medical conditions getting included, especially language ""individual risk benefit."" remember seemed like everywhere longer checked proof category opened first time around.

Then again, they're counting overweight obese like before, applies vast majority Americans need lie anyway. gave damn all, boosters elderly would approved labor day. simply, obviously, care people. care abstractions, reifications, like ""ending pandemic."" Compare contrast NIH, openly admiring successful Israeli booster policies. NIH actually cares patient outcomes.

It's going hard read cdc's influenza vaccine recommendations straight face failed recommend covid vaccine booster health care workers, little protection infection, perhaps negligible protection, case covid could well significantly worse case influenza (which treated OTC PO med). 

Add that, TN others may prioritize increasingly limited supply monoclonals people unvaccinated. monoclonals, administered early, pretty good job preventing disease providing ready antibodies long since faded away case Pfizer vaccinations dating back eleven months. nightmare scenario unvaccinated people may actually better vaccinated ones could conceivably come result decision.

There words, really, damage CDC done since beginning, continues do.   line thinking dangerous. treat everyone infected proving took vaccine protect transmission pretty totalitarian. narrative unvaccinated issue backwards unreal. vaccine cure virus would big deal, since still get sick transmit vaccinated there's safety granted even vaccinated, whole argument falls flat face. power grab anyone willing give liberties enforce coward. Get vaccine, helps people's medical treatments none concern.    Also, thank reply. Lol hybrid immunity?

I reason want get vaccine want get COVID. platform isn’t exactly purest place weirder. It’s anonymous filled much advertising misinformation. voting system filter content, what’s say filtered content isn’t actually truth.  probably ... depending percentages vaccinated, number cases evolve, whether new variants appear different characteristics.

Philippines even blocked nurses leaving county (need stay help domestic See answer above.  Correction - make 22% covid cases One data point pattern 12 years 1 second old, much different That's failure accurate data gathering imo. macro level look person currently (their home likely) say that's caught covid, look (a wedding, party) say ""there's inciting event."" looking positive results recorded medical record led out-of-county transfer, likely within home county, especially include airport testing results (you report separately see specific ports doing.)

Like, get vaccinated go without mask well good. did. like month, maybe two months later, new strains started showing one shot became two (with booster) went back masking up. 

To me, seems like Occam’s razor here, virus spreads, wear mask, vaccine shows up, virus takes step back, mask vax, new variations/mutations show places vaccinated went without masks (and commingled unvaccinated people vaccinated different manufacturer vax). Almost like vaccine helped lot folks, also allowed grow change soon could. dunno. sell things living. scientist doctor.   Never miscommunication knew many converts Church Dumbass.

You know happened 1918? Many doctors nurses died trying take care flu victims abysmal conditions brought nurse shortage. survived brutal conditions quit. set back numbers registered nurses even further. Literally, hospitals became poorly staffed practically saved nearly one death. Calls went anyone ever taken care sick people, regardless training. Even young women interested work ended quitting ward work within 1-2 months, fraction ""temp"" workers.

It took decade nursing staffing levels go back pre-1918 levels, **and still shortage numbers**. eve WWII numbers started increasing positively.

Except poor governments antivaxx remain power. also labeled covid deaths? 'New Mexico'... US State, even read story?    know, *sometimes* /s needed  wife's grandmother(80s) died yesterday, aunt husband convinced grandma vaccinated people ""super spreaders"" get vaccinated (among stupid arguments). dead act like fault covid brought home her. Also statistics involved mean nothing - worse, entirely misleading own.

eg, say (hypothetically) 50% hospitalized cases vaccinated, 50% aren't. own, sounds like chances completely equal whether vaccinated not.

But 80% population vaccinated, ""equal chances"" would 80% cases vaccinated 20% not. 50/50 actually hugely imbalanced towards unvaccinated cases.

And course, hospitalized cases 80/20 - isolation that'd sound like vaccinated much worse, would probably publicised such. Service Corporation International? July 2020 play  irrational fear

Die Dr. Dick! mean schedule appointment one categories another step approval process?

Oh, suggestion end smoking, chain thought recognised one started smoking with. 'it's one two every often, I'll fine' 💯 Controlling covid relies upon layering strategies I’ve seen way much over-reliance vaccines alone. 

There’s element ableism play too, lumping concerns chronically ill/disabled folks along anti-vaxxers, needs vulnerable dismissed. 

Anti-vaxxers usually covid mitigation strategies, whereas chronically ill, disabled, can’t take vaccine advocate layering strategies. horrible 7 kids died past three months, articles skew public perception issue: unvaccinated child lower risk *vaccinated* adult (by large margin elderly), lower risk unvaccinated adult. deaths spillover spread adults, dying higher rates. 

There's acceptable pediatric death count, think adult deaths nice either. way stop efficiently vaccinating adults using restrictions stop spread. Vaccinating children fine, last resort used better options.

Going ""oh well, half adults want get vaccinated, dozens hundreds vaccinated unvaccinated adults keep dying, we'll nothing that, we'll focus preventing 2 dead kids per month"" weird moral position. real reason leaving? many people died covid New Mexico? seperation church state.

Statements like ""we boosting healthcare workers first dose""

You going convince anti-vaxxers change mind someone close dies. look facebook. rabidly opposed. 

Saying people gone longest without dose, exposed often, upon rely maintain healthcare system deserve booster, even though FDA advisory panel voted unanimously recommend such?

The CDC director made right call follow FDA approvals case. otherwise risks stressing already stressed healthcare system, leaving one care idiots refuse vaccinate. Completely agree. terrified dying, know want buried little fanfare possible. Put ground, let nourish earth.  Even thing does, isn’t enough?? panel also said younger people, 18 49 years old underlying medical conditions, **may assess risk choose get booster want one.**

See bolded text. Go get booster. type 2 diabetic, certainly be. Patient loads real crazy here. context, specific ward gave us 5:1 ratio student nurses 4 12-bed rooms, 2-3 staff nurses per shift. Said ward also overflow 20-30 beds hallways. 

We treated free labor, training us. odds dying 33 yrs old. Also, agree different lifestyles lower higher risks? That's terrific life advice :P. sure right. can't believe dumb people are. say anti-vaxxers vocal people seem (thankfully) reasonable get vaccinated. Social media makes seem like majority people dumb.  dunno. Vaccines get close enough zero transmission risk mask much. mask reduces chance spread 50%, matters lot talking 1/5 chance vs 1/50 chance. antivaxxer argument like saying wearing helmet motorbike prevent die, like riding without helmet. Something many laypeople understand got angry are:

* Non-binary, continuous (fuzzy) logic (""No, be, something between!"")
* Something multiple factors contribute differently (""Why can't give us single root cause?"")
* Conditional logic (""So mean time yes time no?) people chronic illnesses risk also offered 3rd shortly. forgot include - sorry.

That bit overstatement. Nothing certain communicated officially, strange considering appear plenty vaccines. disease measures, reactive rather proactive. case outbreak school, test team sent pupils tested instance.

Again think overselling actual state affairs. test system indeed great even proactive testing older school kids place. all. 

There guidelines proper ventilation, air filtration “too expensive”, CO2-meters “under consideration” month, close contacts schools longer isolate schools take absolutely precautions whatsoever - parents squeezed together unventilated classrooms info meetings, classes years mixed constantly overnight school trips organised. People younger dying. happen. can't support CDC director overruling panel recommendations.

I know vote close, know split FDA CDC panel recommendations. Leave split president solve.

It's appropriate Biden stand firm choose agency's recommendation want follow. Forcing CDC match FDA smacks much coward politicking me. Maybe later. moment. dude sited (and trusts) study made israel, likely give shit anyone himself.  What’s going breakthrough cases. it’s really relevant. people might degree immunity already - tldr studies still get vaccinated increase immunity. CDC data damned right.

Er, crazy Christians, think that's rather extreme position. surely animosity Catholics past, would think common Protestant position Pope he's leader church Catholic religion correct interpretation religion. consensus? CDC panel disagreed FDA panel. question occupational exposure voted down, 9 6, CDC panel. 9 6 even consensus within panel.  Walensky made good, common sense decision. Good her. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus second usually say it. Almost everyone know anti-vaxxers understands people medical complications different. fact, they're one reasons much anger toward anti-vaxxers. recently learned someone know can't get vaccine cranked anti-vaxxer hate (didn't know could hate people more). People like get choice need protected people establishing herd immunity. wonder firefighters believe water put fires too!!!  everyone get immunity every vaccination. example, Hepatitis B vaccine issue. people get vaccine don’t respond like people don’t get immunity. I’m surprised people responding way COVID vaccination well. bodies little different. everyone responds way every drug/vaccination. prayers speedy recovery. Essentially western provinces dropped restrictions much lower vax rates June/early July facing pressure. biggest province, Ontario, well ~670 cases per day province 15M people. That’s like Denmark averaging ~250 cases per day they’re 330-350 range right now. got shamans witch doctors side, told us truth/s That's every single vaccine does. Sterilizing immunity literally full binding viral S1 RBD sites. Non-sterilizing immunity partially binding 100% effective preventing cell entry. 95% effective 10x better nothing.

What matters immune system response rate. basically race. seems according article odds spreading same. article extrapolated since higher % unvaxxed covid vaxxed spread higher unvaxxed people. 
But reality rate spread higher rate infection inflates numbers. Based Blake: ""Little 2000 deaths day wave hit peak deaths."" thought current consensus (CDC, various university professors TWiV) rare fully vaccinated individuals experience symptoms. saying teachers symptomatic 3 weeks? wonder what's going then. No, 4 separate votes yesterday.

no worms going come die, bacteria inside body decomposes what's left can't help anymore (because dead).

the reason maggots thing flies somehow find way reproduce dead flesh (i.e. dirt air. pretty easy death planned).

yes, bugs literally everything eat whatever eat going decomposed stomach acid.

it's like fucking alien. Yeah death rate absolute numbers per Capita? Last saw surpass new York numbers even pandemic. unvaccinated direct effect others, ones without seatbelts endangering themselves. might influence others use seatbelts, deaths influence others *use* seatbelts. cancels out. think deny people ability kill long without harming others (yes, mean actual suicides too, try help get better, ultimately choice make). Social Darwinism finest That's one thing. immune system constantly exposed pathogens. get sick eliminate fast enough show symptoms.

So a) window infectious immune system deals much lower, sometimes hours b) clear virus cases gets sick (replicates enough experience symptoms) c) shed less viral load since body better chance fighting quickly.

Nothing sealed airways - viruses still breathed in, they're dealt trained immune system. Weird, cause 2 kids family get covid, adults spend time kids time covid never tested positive (the adults vaccinated) Hurr durr. cdc home country test see difference vaccination testing comes spreading.

One event everyone tested negative one event everyone vaccinated. event everyone vaccinated score 3 times better (resulted 3 times less infections). Oh no! Anyway...    sympathize, problem scofflaws influence bystanders. Young kids. Best keep belted avoid fine. 

Same vaccines: many misinformed comply means avoiding penalties like loss unemployment benefits.  There's filtration studies showing far greater efficacy giving credit for.   atop telling people vaccine doesn’t work people still die. hurts efforts force everyone. - almost national healthcare ,elective surgeries covered. Hence, universal healthcare 100% true description limits covered. Hence, rules unvaccinated denied limited coverage huge step take place accountability people. Pretty crazy considering 1918 flu pandemic lasted 2 years total, even fourth wave 1920 far less severe. Looks like Covid-19 pandemic last least 3 years even massive vaccination campaigns modern healthcare. Like Washington state governor wanted keep dictator powers longer hoarded almost two million doses didn’t let used. Authorization soon children, insurance income freely administered vaccine?

Those issues full third nation refuses help end pandemic.  easy immediately understand logic flawed imagine extreme cases like say 100% vaccinated, there's result 100% hospitalised. think testing statistics extreme cases often give quick understanding something changes factors change.  went festival UK entry without clear lateral flow test also double jabbed. day packed gills, long story short 2 weeks 4 tests later covid, neither people went also vaccinated.

Looks promising fingers crossed probably days providers catch new recommendation. That’s happened underlying medical conditions approved booster.      I'm trying downplay -- -- please aware kids catch covid essentially cold-like symptoms.

Pandemics literally count rely population lacking immunity, like we've seen covid. Covid already killing negligible statistics protected - covid becomes endemic, reduce even further.

Almost certainly. best nurses best food parties Wallensky two options thanks 9 15 panel members putting terrible position either overruling them, CDC overrule FDA. They're bad, overruling FDA, especially regard healthcare workers, would worse.

Given counts high risk, decision exclude occupational risk arbitrary, evidence based concern risk. Many doctors opposed seemingly concerned nonmedical issues like belief would discourage first two remaining unvaxxed. Needless say, difference evidence believing that, evidence demanding boosters, staggering. 

So good took least bad option. we're left *even more* arbitrary distinction who's left out.

Seriously. tested positive night spending day watching movies bed pregnant girlfriend. vaccinated never treated positive that, despite business day.

I also never developed sniffles, headaches feeling kinda spacey foggy headed. honestly thought allergies hitting extra hard year test. That's correct guess.

On hand, thought serous shit going Governor declared state emergency shortage stuff, yada yada.

It's much less likely vaccinated   like could look reality history viral evolution evidence less deadly viruses widespread deadly ones kill hosts.

Even you’re *as* contagious *as long* you’re still contagious best. Studies stay conflicting.

I’m convinced whole “you GET COVID” symptomatic disease.. totally forget asymptomatic spread last year? Recent real world example, two vaccinated friends. One symptoms noticed sense smell started go, got tested positive. friend close got tested shits &amp; giggles, absolutely symptoms, tested positive. Would get near them? wouldn’t. 

IMO get vaccinated health conflicts. long cases high indoor business restrictions mask mandates really want control spread.  highest rate Waterford vaccine rate 99.7% People animals *can* vaccinate. Wild animals can't be, possibly spread us again. time someone first discovered COVID-19, pandora's box opened. never was, never functioning 0 COVID strategy rely authoritarian means permanently remove basic human rights. Look what's going Australia right now. Protesters (Whether agree not) beaten abused name ""safety"". People arrested simply outside, even they're cars. shot dogs simply people come adopt them. That's people look think COVID prevented, want? listen TWiV call breakthrough stuff mostly media b.s. highlights interesting (for better worse) important disparity vax vs non-vax issue. Almost advertising dollars spent anti-vax side (aka Facebook ads), seen almost evidence significant spending promoting vaccine awareness (in US). 

The significance advertising/awareness/etc. unfortunately extends medicine, it’s hard deny point. Public health policy needs start embracing fact. Japanese culture generally support traditional medicine western medicine? might factor.

I know Taiwan struggled get access vaccines even though government supports vaccine. top challenge population generally leary western medicine covid vaccine. They're fine masks preventive measures though. (My source conversations American expat lives Taiwan it.) Stress factor according TWiV evidence believing vaccine efficacy decreases 8 months. fair share idiots thankfully minority. strict lockdowns I'm sure played huge part high uptake vaccines. Resuming, taking vax risking life covid selfish case get virus, remain less time system less likely infect people without vaccine. Looks reasonable. 
In opinion, horrible job told everyone vaccines need 5 10 years approved telling young people little likely die Covid. work factory style setting lot people close proximity company implementing mandatory vaccines I'm definitely getting mine Maderno's Vaccine approved booster. ‘slip right through’ argument seems somewhat fixation. remember coming lot 80s HIV  missing general point reduction compared continuing every day activities Apparently, bunch convinced infections coming vaccinated people. mind-boggling well done! seems COVID-facing provider, something like cuts noise. Conservatives uneducated see world much simpler really feel like reasonable idea. going told go work everyday offered boosters keep protection strong possible till over.  think would happen, pleasantly surprised wrong. right call. bad worse two choices her...

😂😂😂 thing keep mind haven’t really excluded anyone. ability anyone self attest wide range conditions means everyone really wants get booster can.

What they’ve avoided suggesting EVERYONE need go get booster regardless benefit time we’re undertake mass vax campaign 12s.

I think really best approach right now. I’m sure data become available future people actually need booster recommendation change reflect that. God save New Mexico! “just knows” man. lol science isn’t followed? Genuinely curious.

For example, part reason CDC reluctant address problem waning protection want people lose confidence COVID vaccinations. 

The evidence indicates booster around 6 months needed create proper secondary immune reaction 3 weeks short dosing schedule (although justified due emergency situation). fact, become apparent many (Dr. Fauci included. said interviews recently) booster dose around 6 months actually part full vaccination sequence. might well give everybody,”

You choosing vaccinate protect people disadvantage ask for. lot vulnerable people might think choosing vaccinate help protect them. remember nation wide misinformation campaigns

The tobacco companies  yea world severely overpopulated kids dying street every day Everything’s already opened back up. Concerts packed, music festivals ongoing, shopping back normal, traffic shitty lol. places require customers masks there, employees places wear masks, bigger events require proof vaccination/recent covid test. like differences daily life tbh, everyone’s getting back things far I’m seeing.

Godspeed also isn’t really factual evidence major (or minor matter) clear texts forbidding vaccines.

Anxiety fear related issues second highest risk factor covid. Ironic huh? go keep fearmongering. Good work. blame problems unvaccinated people. There's lot things can't say ""for sure"" regarding happen fall. clearly see currently places high vaccination rates much better rest country.

I never suggested natural immunity non-issue. largely overblown scale quality immunity. 70% vaccination rate obviously going provide much stronger protection 70% vaccination plus natural immunity rate. tells need wearing masks even we're vaccinated. ever make Texas, get Martin House Salty Lady whatever meme beer they're making.

It may seem insensitive inconsiderate you, real it.

I look forward sources claims I've able find anything correlates claims. Please show I'm wrong, evidence supports conclusion. Governor Montana recently claimed ""a lack meaningful, reliable research"" whether masks protect kids used argument prop emergency ruling make masks optional Montana schools. full quote:

“Unfortunately, mandating masks students based inconclusive research fails prove masks’ effectiveness reducing incidence COVID-19 classroom. Simply put, children shouldn’t subject arbitrary mask mandates schools can’t follow science there’s lack meaningful, reliable research. hand, scientific studies we’ve carefully reviewed undoubtedly reveal adverse impacts masking child’s health, wellbeing, development,” 

Leaders spreading kind misinformation...  I’ll … slap … your, err …. umm …. bags. 

I think it’s supposed kind threat. joke. 

I’m told quite effective. One fellow locals pointed handful people posting threads actually community, people posting bogus accounts accounts based elsewhere. agree orchestrated. still disappointing see locals jumping supporting it. It’s six months second dose. second dose? left fact much harder someone vaccinated get point first place.

If much harder, 75% Provincetown cluster would vaccinated. *was* context. tell everyone 75% cluster could vaccinated ""that much harder"" vaccinated person become infected? 

??


?? Making lot presumptions Yeah, JAQing off.

Just asking questions. Sure dude. Bring back black IPA Love texture Guinness it’s better Ireland tap ultimately lacks character quite watery class beer. anyone recommend dark beer silky texture Guinness actually character you’d expect proper stout I’d love rec make sense. Viruses muscle existence. first come, first serve. Delta numbers advantage Mu, could come foreground given time. Plenty people still hit. think mean that’s think it’s absurd boosters seen necessary people higher risk severe infection; mild infection scoffed non-issue. obviously highest concern hospitalization death, mild infections still carry risk damage potentially longterm issues.

I don’t think talking prior infection. love craft beer rarely drink Miller/Bud/Coors type say vastly prefer sipping nice stout, event everyone pounding Coors Light, bit weirder slowly sip craft beer enjoy it. I'd rather pound craft beer cases I'll go whatever cheap beer like best (High Life me) keep others. fun stout (I've plenty stout three) sometimes situation really call it. Sometimes I've brought session beers like Founders Day something point I'm fine saving money I'm going really take time enjoy beer much anyway. can't stand IPAs, last 10 years seen race craft brewers see make bitter disgusting IPA. tastes like eating pine tree, better apparently. reads like Donald Trump describing himself. Friggin IPAs. There's enough bitterness life without drinking too. 12312412 varieties IPA every grocery store shelf red ales doppelbocks (my two favorites) impossible find outside specialty shops. least gets slightly easier find decent dark beer winter seasonal selection. difference make?

Yeah, walked clinic. ask ID paperwork. wanted know healthy enough vaccinated consented. Nobody knows name. proof vaccinated.  hate coffee asshole.

Getting great cup coffee complicated. So, back thought cramming unvaccinated people confined spaces good idea we're big brain things? Moderna's effectiveness waning way Pfizer's has, though Facebook-fueled bravado? Cow urine popular indian groups, let use Bats don’t fly far  Fair enough, many people year killed medical malpractice. instances history something deemed safe, recalled side effects. really risk ways. It’s sad many police dying Covid. Many would consider heroes job thankless. 
They made personal medical choice get vaccinated possibly wear mask. infected never known line duty incident died of. choice consciously made themselves. love much say give tent hospital outside, anti vaxx nurses care them, maskless. laptops google home remedies order horse paste online. believe everyone. Unless you’re immunocompromised. Maine fact surging right now. case numbers high them

Right--and cases high vaccines shows contagious Delta is, even high vaccination rate. think say sure going get worse fall places. 

Immunity prior infection non-issue. fact AUS one NZ exposed effectively increases number vulnerable hosts things equal compare US NE countries. Worth pointing masks essentially non-existent Norway first wave well. Basically Norwegians used masks second wave October March, even mostly recommended crowded indoor settings distancing otherwise possible (such public transport rush hour). comes restrictions, vast majority US none

Sure do! example, we're restricted seeing doctor checkup non-emergency medical procedure, like cancer surgery. die hospital hospital? thing that’s scary believe enough risk lives livelihood. That’s shows two things. shows intentionally manufactured constant state doubt confusion among don’t really believe anything conviction, shows slaves system even tho willing bet lives belief, they’re willing bet wages. Yeah, shed virus get people.   got breakthrough COVID booster Monday. think let kids school unless every adult household vaccinated. lead bunch vaccinated antivaxxers “not getting covid”. inevitably use proof Covid hoax. Biggest issue really either. 

There basically enforcement place this. texted (vaccinated) Mom state ICUs 95% full, calls two minutes later saying (vaccinated) Dad going emergency gallbladder removal. think getting surgery done today. Grateful got bed, also want fuck safe, asap. 

I ready tell anti-vaxxers come me. fucks left give, especially literally spit face healthcare workers. everything said accurate, type people generally anti vax also type vote government assistance universal healthcare. want capitalism vice might want stop voting interests guns abortion Jesus. pay $3k/mo high deductible health insurance paid nothing first $12k/person. paying health insurance, paying continuous coverage avoid pre-existing conditions. following FUCKING STUPID!  Allagash Curieux, something actually Belgium think vaccine resistant people terrible thinking things through. can't think hassle find new job. push comes shove actually think finding new job, realize skipping vaccine important. think claim comes study nurses Vietnam. study mainly looking infections delta comparison older strains. Many anti vaxxers misrepresented findings study push narrative… surprise surprise. funny thing is, ultimately CDC guidance still recommendation. Even FDA booster authorization recommendation. emergency use authorization issued, doctor free use vaccine off-label. instance, doctors provided vaccine children 12, despite recommended. Yeah, COBRA complete BS. mean ""He's Mr. Q""?  Literally uses COBRA? Every time offered absurd amount like 2-3k month. Interesting theory. It'd shame someone to... TEST IT! Masks school help prevent Covid-19 outbreaks spread, CDC studies find

First Covid-19 outbreaks far likely schools require students staff wear masks, new data US Centers Disease Control Prevention shows.

Journalism schools really teach modicum scientific literacy. Unvaxxed, unemployed uninsured time pandemic. Yeah, sounds like **great** idea! Clarification...

I never said enough evidence yet long term side effects mRNA vaccines. simply presuming **you** think is.

You mostly correct earlier assumed person complete faith/trust scientists/science. 'complete' faith/trust 'strong'. I’m talking people saying vaccine makes people shed. Cowards through.  You’re getting downvoted you’re right, Guinness fine beer taste anywhere near dark color would think. Wednesdays record promptly broken Thursday. virus vaccine - actual SARS-CoV-2 get people.   place employment. owner sent email urging employees get vaccinated, right thing etc. also CCed company lawyer...I'm sure there's mandate coming within next weeks. hate IPA, bitter without much taste. Porters stouts variety better taste. state California pretty good getting 65+ residents vaxxed. Remember Feds deferred States things like masks closures aspects. California partnered states review recommendation. expect information guidelines released Monday. California approves CDC booster recommendations: Western States Scientific Safety Review Workgroup Friday endorsed national Centers Disease Control Prevention recommendations booster doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Workgroup provided confirmation governors California, Nevada, Oregon Washington today recommending third doses vaccine people 65 older, people living long-term care facility, people 50-64 underlying medical conditions. group also said people ages 18-64 received Pfizer vaccine may also receive booster dose awful. 

I got argument husbands relative. simply said due mother’s health conditions, Covid could kill her. Ok, extreme… but, exploded. didn’t want deal fact decisions might responsible something like that. Instead saying, much fault his. 

I see huge issue. People right choose. refuse take accountability. That’s we’re seeing misinformation trying blame vaccinated people cases. I’m scared needles, due traumatic childhood event. got latched direction somehow. *have* see put blinking needle arm. Stick eye even. dare jab backside, swear I’m going hit floor like someone casted petrificus totalis spell me. think GIJOE bail out. places open grocery stores/pharmacies/hospitals fast food takeaways

What hell. knew NZ stopped takeaways allow fast food places restaurants seems daft. ""what mean late, give shot!!!"" \*cough\* \*cough\* Imagine training protect people failing simple test society can't grind halt unmitigatable risks, mean mitigatable risks mitigated. crowd seems opposite every tenet religion hate neighbor seems biggie, living peace, xenophobes letting god judge people first great commandment. 
39 second like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor thine self.

They can't even get pandemic right right too. God told cover faces social distance! Leprosy diseases sounds like good advice me. mean want wait till COVID (and ruin health risk death) take precautions meant protect village neighbors. Sounds bit *pride*ful *self*ish mask social defiling disease must wear torn clothes, let hair unkempt, cover lower part face cry out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’ 
 
As long disease remain unclean. must live alone; must live outside camp.

What better way love thy neighbor get vaccinated reduce risk exposing covid? (And reduce risk death severe illness.) Yes? 

Now imagine stayed asymptomatic entire stretch illness. President issued order OSHA mandate employers 100 people employees vaccinated, unless medical religious exemption. employers comply, companies fined OSHA. means incentive fire non-compliant employee avoid fines. physically forced get vaccine, likely fired don't.

The court ruled order constitutional, challenged. 10,000 test positive Covid, showing Covid-like symptoms? test positive, could another virus, like RSV, influenza even common cold virus. 

As far know, theoretically *could* still reinfected spread it, think extremely unlikely, especially soon reinfection. think lot data immunity vaccinated, get breakthrough infection (we know infected, get vaccinated extremely strong immunity, might strong way around). would keep wearing mask indoors Let's clear. Vaccines ever promise keep us hospital. ever meant reduce chances dying. No. 610 million got one dose 210 million gotten doses. vaccines work, danger?

Not everyone get vaccine, vaccine work everyone get can’t eradicate covid. It’s almost worse global warming needing collective effort get fixed, never fucking happen.

No, make sure people survive encounter. Federal Court: constitutional right shut business name non-science people cannot get vaccinated, vaccine effect, depend everyone else vaccinated prevent diseases killing them. grandmother chemo drugs long immune system shot, even gets vaccine help (no antibody response). can't even go shopping many unvaxxed people area literally risking life going crowds. Conservatism kills expected good wise stewards physical bodies.

The best way getting vaccinated. 

Imagine you’re adrift ocean, desperately praying God’s help. passing ship stops offer aid, wave off, telling captain God’s going come along minute save you.

Letting drown expecting God step handle everything doesn’t make sense. Choosing drown didn’t believe ship sent God, therefore must want drown doesn’t make sense. This, however, aligns fda advisory panel's decision, well fda decision. still narrow, least better excluding healthcare workers. Let's assume that, like said, effect preventing severe symptoms (hospitalisation) it.

Pandemics like stress medical system. infinite ICU needs infinite medical personnel. beds become full, people curable diseases end put danger along covid patients.

If prioritise, start choosing well best chances survival get treatment ditch lowest survival chances.

Beyond that, overwhelmed medical system is, operations non-covid non-emergency-but-still-horrible diseases conditions delayed page suffering needlessly 

This assuming vaccine helps keep symptoms mild. reality, reduces rate people contact it, number days infectious, possibly decrease viral load (which ties transmissibility). plus side, unless one original trial participants, plenty time wait moderna seem wane 12 months: That's lot zeros missed Copying comment elsewhere unvaccinated affect vaccinated:

1. Taking ICU hospital beds hogging medical stuff needed deal non-covid emergencies people dealing with.

2. Providing fertile ground virus mutate. course, mutate everyone, even vaccinated, they're unlikely spread (because everyone vaccinated), mutation dies them. likely spread it, however, mutation catches on.

3. order resolve problems 1. 2. without vaccine mandate, governments issuing nonpharmaceutical interventions like distancing, isolation, masks, inconvenient everyone. everyone got vaccinated, perhaps would able move those.

That said, support mandate would depend country's state 1. 2. critical, think mandate required. population refuses vaccine country still 2020 situations country robust healthcare system handle it, think mandate justifiable. know enough situation US make call guys, criteria.   200420_Operation-Drumbeat_WWII-U-Boats_Lights.txt

I first heard biography George McGovern. seemed  Right? Get side effects way schedule. Favorite part:

“[I]ndeed nowhere,” said court, plaintiffs “address right work hospital attend State Fair, unvaccinated pandemic, ‘deeply rooted Nation’s history tradition.’” Haha good them! Imagine one racist type anti vaxxers knowing lost job going minority. Must really frost gourds!! OK dating kissing people? Yeah probably ask her. I’ll never understand even think Ivermectin solution, get prescription form doctor human-safe dosage level? jump right horse products? Horse take lot shit can; there’s reason phrase “______ enough kill horse” exists! think trust CDC someone writing Atlantic, much want believe he's saying. fact is, really data tells us something like: ""Unvaccinated people 16 times likely spread virus vaccinated people."" 8 times likely. twice likely. never find figure nobody knows. absence study gives us figure, cannot say vaccinated significant source covid spread. 

He infers saying vaccinated people much less likely get covid, CDC found 75% Provincetown cluster made vaccinated people. covid. high nasal viral loads. Perhaps symptoms mild. still covid apparently spreading Provincetown. Republicans fifth columnists gained 15lb since hanging socially Filipino co-workers. safer alternative acquiring immunity smallpox use pus pustule formed cowpox. two viruses closely enough related crossover immunity achieved. cow parks produce pustule site exposure, produce pustules whole body.

Thus name ""vaccination"", derived ""vacca"", Latin ""cow"". still, that's lower death rate Covid. So...

My boyfriend (25m) got placed baby well meaning horrid family. stuck eating ass first date play safe. concern very, rare chance myocarditis. concerned catching COVID, there's lots spread are, would make feel better, brainer. can't keep up. Cremation Denmark, high vaccination rate, breakthrough cases vaccinated population seem center around older immunocompromised patients, vaccinations less efficient. generally vaccines, specific Covid. they're getting third shot here. 

But older vaccinated patients get Covid less sick average hospitalization death rates remain low. first wave retirement homes really hit hard many cases high mortality rates. 

Covid still here, high vaccination rates, age brackets gone 1-2 levels average case severity, really.

80% adult hospitalized patients unvaccinated (but 15% adult population), 20% vaccinated (out 85%). tells everything need know, really.  couldnt pay enough teacher right now. basically, people can't infringe rights others? Anti vaxxers infringe health people. Unfortunately solution bankruptcy survive.  awful thought. kids never remember life without masks :( Felt way deep fried Snickers. ruined day.

Even though disagree outcome, superbly written. pandemic really still mask everywhere go? Hell yeah. Good job! Every day see bs. wrong stop spreading it.

Yes vaccines 100% effective, absolutely designed expected prevent majority infections entirely. That's talked achieving herd immunity vaccination. preventing infections ending transmission chains. Yea, testing much harder arrange. weird. KOB4 news based Albuquerque, NM. term people New Mexico New Mexicans. I’m Oklahoma City work trip. one wearing masks social distancing here. 

“Guess I’ll Die” license plates. went cleveland clinic get mine. know rare, nerves hit cause lifelong pain. So, went blood test center mine, know experience CVS employee vs RN. read actual decision maybe based hospitalization, data pretty much symptomatic infection - [here's summary current state positive test (symptoms no) much presented, outcome riddled confounding (who gets tested asymptomatic pretty variable, results selection bias).

We currently strong argument boosters needed mild covid. Long covid highly correlated severity symptoms, there's evidence boosters would much either.

If want two cents, surprised get data later boosters recommended end - either due time (recommended 1 year 2nd dose) find moderate benefit (it's unlikely would big benefit, current data would already enough show that, small medium sized benefit definitely could show up). now, happy vaccines thing countries good uptake (like Portugal) ending restrictions, worry uptake countries low. That’s fourth random Ralph joke I’ve heard last 24 hours. idea he’s popular late, say is, “Go banana!”  Vaccines tell body produce antibodies specific virus get ready it. could still get sick, bad. hang people cold, cause really, wants sick? sucks.

We're already seeing hospitals fill (again) unvaccinated patients, critical condition, patients can't get also need help reasons.

If want vaccinated, please stay hospitals over. need herd immunity done, survive, guarantee. Much better odds dying winning lotto, complications last months. Meh,...

(fixed you) years ago, started taking new anti migraine medication neurologist warned food might taste differently side effect medication. couple days starting medication, served coffee grabbed oreos breakfast. dipped oreo coffee took bite taste like mushroom.

TLDR: common good takes precedence individual selfishness. day discovered Filipino food day knew going gain 200lbs. I'm old enough remember idiots, realize nothing really changes human nature: baseline pretty meh. like vaccines autism ivermectin, antivax gang continue reference bad paper months years come. odds successful (for virus) mutation much lower vaccinated people unvaccinated. literally numbers game. Fuck constitution. human rights issue.

You get tell put body. Every time someone gets infected cells make proteins create virus bodies virus made natural possibility body make wrong proteins create mutation virus. mutation goes infect new hosts purely chance become infectious and/or deadly. virus “collective” plan, memory consciousness. entirely fault cells creating proteins virus dna/rna randomly cause mutations. Ok, guns.  Italian grandmother used pile pounds pasta meatballs plate. I'd eat finish everyone eat noticed I'd hear yelling eat. Good thing played sports. Meanwhile, New York day 100 deaths since March. FDA voted unanimously favor recommending boosters HCW's. CDC hand... Darwin nominees? samsung pay....  slipped calculation get accurate vaccination number, slip caused feeding frenzy anti-vaxx community. admission retraction authors get mention anti-vaxxers. CFS (thanks genes, mom!) it’s brutal. I’ve since teenager. early 20’s caused suddenly develop onion intolerance. last year I’ve developed allergy bandage adhesive. Full surprises, guess. Every time someone gets infected cells make proteins create virus bodies virus made natural possibility body make wrong proteins create mutation virus. mutation goes infect new hosts purely chance become infectious and/or deadly. virus “collective” plan, memory consciousness. entirely fault cells creating proteins virus dna/rna randomly cause mutations. look reinfection rate 1% severe cases 7% mild asymptomatic cases. 

That essentially falls line natural immunity efficacy, there’s 95% efficacy antibodies produce anyways. 

Herd immunity way get past this, either means everyone gets vaccinated get sick. remember 1 3 getting covid Back up, Homer Simpson...

Positive test result numbers look flat all. higher before, January peak. true medical decisions 16 years. vaccination corona different, 12 years kid final say Yeah that’s entire article says.

And even think that's misinterpretation statistics.

Person 10% chance coming contact Covid, does, 5% chance becoming severe infection.

Person B 50% chance coming contact Covid, does, 1% chance becoming severe infection.

Both persons 0.5% chance catching Covid going hospital. people look second number wrongly concludes person five times danger. clapped. Im nervous variant 6 months waiting. work school covid 8 months ago, pfizer vaccine 6 months ago. prob pretty safe getting it, HOWEVER want it.

I used think death rate would dramatically decline seem case. I'm wondering matter time US reaches 1 million deaths.

Currently 680k total new deaths 2k/day.

Also, likely many people go get myocarditis diagnosis since known side effect vaccine compared child recovering flu another virus. time never warned getting flu could cause myocarditis suddenly vaccine causes much smaller rate, extremely concerning.  women fully vaccinated becoming pregnant? hold true babies well? impact vaccinated person? Lol doc K … think understand strong measures been.

Okay….. let take damn mask vaccinated…..  like Clubbanging  please edit title. Dang old Mexicans? world royally f ed :( Fauci gotten much pandemic wrong.

I gotten right pandemic Fauci. example - Delta wave something Fauci dismissed.

Good 17 yo! great role model younger brother definitely hard stand peers seem intangible problem. can't imagine teen It’s crazy body reacts. Ffp3 btw made Honeywell. I'm good. FDA panel voted 3 - 16 releasing boosters general adult population due significant safety concerns

What exactly CDC Director know don't?    still job. get scolded early complaining, activated rights Maine Whistleblower Protection Act. see point view, still disagree. FDA panel (though FDA head) WHO, though CDC. widespread consensus matter, think fair say I'd putting anyone else danger. comparing version 1 current version (4) study text graphs used quite different: 


v1: 
v4: 


I'm scientist, experienced reading journals non-experienced person like stands low number people used study. example paragraph v4 stands (emphasis mine): Ct values detected vaccinated people regardless symptoms time testing (Figure 1C). Ct values &lt;25 detected 7 24 unvaccinated (29%; CI: 13-51%) 9 11 fully vaccinated asymptomatic individuals (82%; CI: 48-97%), 158 232 unvaccinated (68%, CI: 62-74%) 156 225 fully vaccinated (69%; CI: 63-75%) symptomatic individuals. Time symptom onset testing vary vaccination status (p=0.40; Supplemental Figure 2). Infectious virus detected **sole** specimen tested asymptomatic fully vaccinated individual. Although asymptomatic individuals sampled, results indicate even asymptomatic, fully vaccinated people might shed infectious virus.

By reading first part study learned low Ct values mean person may infectious. study found 7 unvaccinated people may infectious 1 fully-vaccinated, asymptomatic person actually proven infectious. no, comment accurate. I'm judging conservative black judging black... cannot help being, anything wrong with. 1- churn FL tourism charts compared state throughout entirety pandemic. Three clusters personal friend network literally souvenir cases popped day returned Florida fuck Florida WOL I’ll ever numbers. 

One souvenir case led first death small western pa town right next mine community spread virtually non existent time. whole fam came back sick vacation 2 weeks later mom gone. 

2- state got caught first wave dealing Covid time literally know half things know keeping people alive. caused huge swell numbers fatalities (among stupid things like nursing homes debacle NE). first wave subsided rest states without excuse.  knew going happen time much better treatment protocols led less mortality. state comes even close reaching numbers infections state caught first wave ashamed policies. maybe attitude actions populace would better Place point fingers vaccines available. course that’s product politics well it’s bit chicken egg. 

3- Added fact Florida reluctant various points pandemic include covid stats people residents. instance particularly something cause discrepancies data high percentage snowbirds population. reported secretly, heard back. 🤦‍♂️ I'm curious nuances situation. I've heard (I think episode ""Science Vs."" podcast) levels virus people's noses Delta classes (vaccinated unvaccinated). agree author unvaccinated get ""infected"" easily spread it, drawing line here? Symptoms? think making case vaccinated individuals need careful spread Delta, viral load argument negates. No, truly understand talking about. people walk around saying ""1% mortality rate"" like means big deal reality, left unabated, virus could easily infected entire planet killed 80 million people (1% population) without breaking sweat. even count people would die things hospitals clogged covid patients capacity treat them. include would happened due mutations. that's okay. Keep Dunning-Krugering way life.  I'm grateful live country get choose :) I'm going get booster lower odds spreading family, own. Good luck there, thanks helping people pandemic.  L l  No, mandating vaccine requirements participate society comes play.

You really think someone cant bothered take shot going bother pill take daily?

This gives excuse vaccinated, say taking pills wont zero inconvenience lives.  Interesting heavily vaccinated Singapore struggling compared heavily vaccinated parts Europe Alberta bad Premier, conservative provincial leader Canada, declare health emergency walk back vow introduce vaccine passports, re-introduce restrictions mask mandates, etc, forced dramatic fashion possible: days federal election federal Conservative allies virtually neck-and-neck governing Liberals polls.

The federal Conservative leader even praised handling pandemic province far better federal response (which despite hiccups far reasoned compassionate US throughout 2020). original CDC slides/messaging honestly kind confusing given one sentence bullets begging detail. Detected viral load high unvaccinated - cases? Some? long? stay high? long take hit peak?

The main thrust still stands, delta, infected, vaccinated person, get viral load they'll spread virus, including without symptoms. exceptional something change relative pre-delta messaging, get they're constantly walking line providing evidence vaccines working do, also showing information bulletproof encourage people drop every single precaution. Sadly think fact people site say ""see, vaccinated people still get/spread covid!"" counterpoint getting vaccines proves point - idiots latch onto whatever bit information form arguments bad faith logical fallacies matter much context explanation gets put around it. matter many times slides hammered home, get vaccinated, still work, everything 'after infection', less likely vaccinated people, want plug ears cover eyes still wrong takeaways. plenty virtual teaching jobs now.

These positions full benefits. Common medicine says do. Everyone needs little common sense. got flu shot, doesn’t mean can’t get symptoms spread variant flu. isn’t politics. viruses work. plenty virtual teaching jobs now.

He literally fully qualified full-time position full benefits. multiple friends right company actively looking new full-time virtual teachers. you’re packed bar time viral load still high

Same teachers. I've got 2 teacher friends breakthrough cases sick kid two class hours end overcame resistance. healthcare worker. Statistically, much higher interaction rate vulnerable populations. inconsistent. Again, protecting yourself. protecting vulnerable populations healthcare workers interact with, regularly, frequently close proximity. true Pfizer vaccine can't used lot places, also true US donated lot vaccines. I've heard donated doses actually arrived yet. seems inevitable booster shots US delay vaccines rest world. That's fighting hard boosters right now.


I struggled lot decision, see sides it. expect anyone else thing offered booster, feel live myself, least now. Unless American, case go work usual infect coworkers. would happy DM interested. approved high risk today take day two catch up. Chain pharmacies asking kind proof I've ever heard there's lot immunocompromised list two, demanding proof guidance equity reasons, sorry found places ignoring CDC guidelines, vast majority aren't, make appointment show up, story meet something immunocompromised list (or high risk/risky job day two), good.

If want Moderna still immunocompromised though, least weeks that's approved others, holding better let things become problems, preemptively address them. That's big wordy article arguing prior vague proclamation assumes. stay home forever crowd pushes narrative No, wasn’t, read past headlines people talking it. said clearly breakthrough infections extremely rare, happen, person spread much someone who’s unvaccinated would. article says too. Still would great sort medication. People want vax still gonna refuse it, therapeutic therapeutic. antibodies people vaccinated. least that's plus.  mean, multiple friends work virtual teachers full benefits. Insurance, 401k, ect...  risks associated vaccines well. younger someone is, less serious effects covid are. entirely obvious age balance out. might point decide vaccinate even younger children, count it.

Now, countries vaccination rate overall low, makes sense. long look benefits societal individual level.   Thanks fro reference!

It's people SARS-CoV2-positive means got tested positive, people 'rona, understand it. clear first read MedArxiv article (or media articles referencing it). higher risk getting Covid, would healthy person 8 months past vaccination. Boosters recommended them. inconsistent. FDA panel recommend healthcare workers get booster. welcome. whole video good recommend watching it. long one. know first mRNA vaccine administered person 2001. Lot's good info here. Wow, wonder line thinking source ""viruses smaller wholes masks"" (and I've never heard water particles...) argument. Closed fall!

I'm happy canary city council mandated every company eligible opt vaccine passport program opt in. want see anti vaxx morons target businesses protecting customers.

Plus would like little revolution, treat.  know flight coming from. could’ve asked hotel reservations state accommodation, and/or rental car reservations show intent immediately get Massachusetts… don’t know.

All know is, mandate back bunch states, including mine, trending badly Covid wanted stop possibly infected people going state. Maybe meant deterrent, I’ve never heard anyone actually caught violation mandate. right  Vaccinated people also afforded far freedom movement, opinion crucial point. Thanks reference!  article looks like proper ratio 1 25000. I'm fairly certain shed spike protein shit. someone mentions spike protein shedding. Tell fun fact ask interacting people's shit? Enough get it, yes. Enough move on, no, kids vaccinated.   misconception think comes clinical studies goals clinical studies show reduction serious illness/death look transmission hard demonstrate accurately. brightest crayon box you? compare vaccines slavery, see much hope productive member society. criticism paper came likely underestimating rate current population without vaccination. something kids tested many find heart issues older. Yeah, can't imagine kinds treatments net-positive places like parts US Russia. places vaccination rates already high, better treatments probably good thing. arm still occasionally bursts pain got second shot way back April. Anyone else issue? not.

The risk getting covid covid harmful is, matter scientific fact, far **far** higher risk vaccine. There's nothing subjective it. pure objective fact. matter much risk willing take, short one extremely rare allergies make adulthood without finding have, risk getting vaccinated **always** higher risk getting vaccinated. though. worked hard put risk. Pfizer can't even used places struggling get vaccines. storage requirements much places. US donated vaccines country, even close. ok protect want booster. Yes. booster/third Pfizer shot side effects **second shot** experience like? work healthcare second dose January 23rd, I'm overdue booster.

You’re making entire antivaxxer movement look like children rest world sees as.

Now, continue embarrass expect given act. Or, surprise rub brain cells together form actual argument.

Don’t child, intelligent thing. might late, hope people see rant. I've trying work decision bothering much (besides I'm teacher obvious bias want third dose) I've figured out.

Remember Republican argument ""only small percentage people real problems, pretty much everyone recovers, what's big deal?"" Well, that's become CDC's argument vote boosters frontline workers, teachers, etc.

I'm tired hearing ""well, data support it"". data crystal clear: nearly everyone vaccinated Pfizer get Covid stands two-dose regimen. decent number subject long Covid. CDC considering hospitalization death poor outcomes, longer concerned actually helping people avoid Covid one brilliant scientific developments ever, mRNA vaccines. pisses off. tools, since vaccines prevent hospitalization death pretty well, that's definition success, we're going use prevent infection. We're going let everyone get Covid.

In studies CDC used themselves, countries initial doses given 3 weeks apart (as opposed months like countries to), Pfizer vaccine 40-50% effective preventing symptomatic infection.

That month two back. [a recent study incarcerated Delta attack rate 81% Pfizer vaccinated inmates, seen another way, *91% people vaccinated 4-6 months ago previous infection*. translates 19% 9% efficacy, respectively, tracks well anecdotes r/covid19positive people whose entire families get sick, despite full vaccination.

It's clear, given enough time dosage, double dose Pfizer basically nothing prevent getting sick. YES, KNOW NEVER OFFICIAL REASON VACCINATE. get hospitalization death technically criteria, still protect well.

It's teachers, medical workers, grocery store clerks' fault governments world vaccinated poorer countries. enormously sympathetic this. time, skip meal day honor someone less fortunate. Likewise, fact talking unvaccinated country, point straight lunatics (minus legitimate health reasons small number peeps) prioritizing vaccines ""just case"" seems ridiculous.

I've supportive government this, really feel they've screwed one up. much appreciated FDA specifically naming teachers subset people get vaccine yesterday, course today CDC voted opposite way. last-ditch hope Dr. Walensky decides allow high-risk professions get third, otherwise, plan let burn Americans let luckiest avoid long Covid. Thank you. makes feel better. dad also got cold week test came back negative. around day started showing symptoms doesn’t it, I’m hoping don’t either CVS, nationwide   Zero. Inflammation read

You read lie.

THAT SAID, covid one dose vaccine, there's reason get second dose one month. half-dozen studies complete agreement. US maybe  Natural immunity better. you’ve covid (I have) still get vaccinated (I data clear: **Natural immunity better.** COVID-19 vaccines create effective longer-lasting immunity natural immunity - third COVID-19 infections result zero protective - **Natural immunity fades faster vaccine - **Natural immunity alone less half effective natural immunity plus vaccination**   mean smoking murdered? people get myocarditis die within 5 years. chances getting astronomically low anyway.

Go rich country you’ll find Filipino nannies nurses. brutal countries allow “bosses” keep passports. Agree, I’m invested knowing results. Let know! yes, Covid would’ve powered too. fact shocked positive, literally sneezed little. symptoms hit days positive. husband also tested negative right away developed symptoms tested positive days later. kid still negative, vaccinated lot recently us though wasn’t old enough first. hopefully vax hold strong still.  Germany unvaccinated staff required get tested 3 times per week *pay tests themselves*. problem idea ""if someone contradicts themselves, means know they're talking about"" engrained people's heads society. entire subreddit 4th grade reading comprehension? I’m agreeing article, jackass, guy named ‘politicsreddit’, *shockingly*, seems read title. Here’s breakdown breakdown seemed skipped too:

-nobody case ever asserted ‘right get vaccinated’, exist, fact lost vaccination refusal fundamental

-at point court inform plaintiff lack ‘right participate society’, happened reddit

-what claim was, EUAs excluded mandates, vax sufficiently experimental court ruled evidence safe longer EUA

-what claim government cant create baseless mandates affect participation society, mandates deprives guaranteed liberties, like Process court agrees, says based valid government purpose, furthers compromised freedoms deeply rooted nations history/tradition freedom. Okay, since bot flagged original comment don’t calm try like functional adult? already general anxiety it’s skyrocketing rn.

 wikipedia believed 120,000 myocarditis deaths per year across world, 1.5/100k. 

if total wars, homicides, terrorisms across world year get 500,000.

myocarditis ranked closer snakebites. good broom  among funnest posts sea stupidity.  Interesting. see maybe paying attention considering circumstances.  idiotic. case Pfizer vaccine, list quite short: contraindication listed FDA “known history severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) component COMIRNATY” — words, person severely allergic ingredient Similarly, CDC says Covid vaccines contraindicated people severe allergic reactions immediate allergic reactions — occurring within four hours including symptoms hives, swelling wheezing — receiving ingredient Covid vaccine previous doses you’ve reaction vaccine past need discussion you’re doctor. 

There medical reasons get vaccinated. time I’ve Old Orchard Beach, Maine, near used book store.  It’s happened though I'd bet money within month reverse course say boosters everyone. Mutations? reason there’s new flu shot every year?

Man, saying know nothing vaccines understatement. Again, county 10,000,000 people, that’s actually quite low. We’re far better call flyover territory. People still making stupid arguments like this? I’ve already Covid? natural immunity enough protect It'd nice info Moderna going discussed.  thing seen reference Fauci saying weeks behind. brother-in-law Filipino. get one family's parties food heaven!    Find 3 articles say it’s flu. want credible sources articles written immunologist doctors, politicians corrupt news outlets.   realize still old people still people pure existing conditions? know people might able take vaccine?

Their lives don’t matter enough vaccine mandate? healthy young people dying would care mandate then? guess so, compared least. Still it’s tough imagine many deaths.  banning alcohol anything? fairly low probability ... maybe 1% population get COVID given month (would 100K cases/day); I'd assume many get cold, say 10%, back-of-the-envelope chances would 10%?

For pure gossip/anecdotal evidence, COVID test last year (before vaccines), since bad cold, wife one couple months ago (both fully vaxed now), negative. benefits might big small, cost/risk nothing.

On one hand, likely case.

On other, reason I'm rushing get 3rd dose *just yet* (aside fact #modernagang can't technically now) moment, best possible protection get 'hybrid immunity' - covid exposure + vaccination.  


**IF** order matter - fully vaccinated individuals later exposed covid / mild case - also get hybrid immunity - think know enough say 3 doses means could miss benefit. really, really want see, comparisons immune response 'hybrid' immunity 3 doses mRNA. Specifically, 'breadth' response - immunity might look years future variants.

I agree example hyperbolic unlikely occur, vaccine mandates extreme action already taken. science” can’t simultaneously tell us we’re sufficiently protected, also peril need keep wearing masks altering lives

Why not?

A booster shot small, measurable risk. Wearing mask measurable risk (at least measured), may risk lower vaccine, higher mask.

It cost-benefit analysis; more-or-less know costs vaccines, know costs masks (much less 'altering lives', whatever means). Also, CDC deals average costs, whereas individual cost function :). Fact matter is, comes public safety, federal government literally anything. government prove matter public safety, it. done becomes matter comply, forced comply.

Except “incidence calculation” off. Way off. wasn’t corrected withdrawn creating considerable traffic Twitter.

“That data suggest tenfold higher incidence (than recent reports) seems surprising,” Ottawa researchers wrote uncorrected version study posted preprint site Sept. 16.

The scientists initially estimated prevalence myocarditis (inflammation heart muscle) pericarditis (inflammation outer lining heart) based 32 consecutive people admitted Heart Institute June 1 end July 2021 suspected diagnosis post-vaccination heart inflammation.

The authors calculated that, study period, total 32,379 doses Pfizer Moderna vaccines administered Ottawa area. “Therefore, cohort captured cases Ottawa area, incidence myocarditis would 0.1 per cent vaccine doses,” 10 cases myocarditis every 10,000 doses vaccine, wrote.

The researchers said data collected vaccine doses came Ottawa Public Health open database.

Except denominator wrong.

Ottawa Public Health confirmed National Post that, study period, 833,000 mRNA (Pfizer Moderna) COVID-19 vaccinations administered Ottawa.

The adjusted incidence four per 100,000 doses, within range recent studies, vastly lower initial estimate.

A research letter published JAMA involving 40 hospitals Washington, Oregon, Montana Los Angeles county two million people received least one dose COVID vaccine estimated incidence one case myocarditis 100,000 vaccinations. another large study Israel published New England Journal Medicine, researchers estimated that, every 100,000 people get Pfizer vaccine, one five would likely develop myocarditis. However, risk heart inflammation 11 events every 100,000 people infected COVID.

“Ottawa Public Health involved study provide data used calculation incidence estimation denominator,” department said email.

The preprint tweeted out, including scientist Dr. Robert Malone, describes “inventor mRNA vaccines” accused spreading COVID misinformation, prompting thousands retweets. “I would rather catch virus. Another reason vaccinate mRNA poison,” one follower responded. Others skeptical, saying risk calculations correct, “hospitals would run heart conditions.”

Late Thursday afternoon, Heart Institute announced via Twitter authors requested paper retracted, incorrect data “vastly inflates incidence post-vaccine myocarditis.”

In interview Wednesday, Dr. Peter Liu, chief scientific officer University Ottawa Heart Institute one study’s authors, said risk calculation corrected sent preprint server, new data hadn’t yet posted.

Liu said researchers incomplete data total doses mRNA vaccines entire region Ottawa. “I think that’s difference came in. numbers getting updated, didn’t get full numbers.”

Anyway, Union County schools mask mandate. couple weeks ago, had, according dashboard:

* 7,153 students quarantined possible exposure
* 449 students test positive
* 232 staff quarantined possible exposure
* 30 staff test positive

So, school board meeting Sept 13th update policies. decision? End quarantine contract tracing.

[I shit state DHHS secretary threated abatement order, meaning state would take control schools, they've since calmed crazy *a little*. Covid way worse flu

And fair, flu worse got natural immunity hundred years so. immunity protection Covid

It's lot safer get vaccine wear mask.

It protect you, protects others well, seeing lowers risk spreading. mask well, even better combined vaccine. smart idea least *consider* getting vaccine. shot two, got mine, even hurt. barely felt it. Sure effects, vast majority people (to knowledge, correct I'm wrong), sore arm, that's it. get effects, know working.

The best part countries, vaccine 100% free, strings attached. There's literally reason get it. Health care workers, specifically, refuse vaccine need fired instantly.

What kind fucking craziness that? see people every day ICU lungs full liquid, ventilators, wheezing last breath, dying alone agony, want vaccine?

Get FUCK out. vast majority people comorbidities, too.  anti-vaxxers keep ignoring fact. ridiculousness steps lmao. Biden recommends boosters all, FDA advisory group says no, vote say actually yes some, another FDA group signs that, somehow that's still recommendation, time CDC, goes FDA recommendation people occupational risk, also recommendation, lady top adds back occupational risk group. 

I even know right point there's probably 30 different conflicting headlines writers confused step like final one process. yes Interesting. Clears things vaccine. CDCs fault published ""report"" around month ago claiming Delta infected vaccinated people transmitted virus easily.

That incredibly misleading, yes, symptomatic people transmit virus, ratio symptomatic people decreased. viral load starts decreasing lot faster vaccinated infected people. find work. end world.  Guess they'll get concentrated opportunity realize it.  Enlighten … don’t want children wear masks? /s Yes, British vaccine advisers recommending vaccine children 15.

Given similar risks rewards age vs 40, also going take vaccine. also Japan, say ""X number Americans..."". Americans higher death rate Japan, obesity levels. Death rates age groups 50 extremely low. 

I also listening scientists also say elderly definitely get vaccine, otherwise, completely personal decision, risks vs rewards low.  Time travel yayyy   Vaccination eligible matter; arbitrary subset population randomly varies location. Vaccination over-50 over-65 matters heavily hospitalization deaths ratio. Vaccination full population matters case counts, though amount needed vary based heterogeneity many infected. I’m happy added health care workers back in!! Bet there's hundreds volunteer firefighters ready hired.  Governments usually subject overtime laws. generally abide (or give comp time), always -- especially salaried workers. I'm American might obvious answer, Americans allowed vaccinate children illnesses suck measles vaccinate covid? covid higher risk majority population? they’re afraid stay home. get another job, trade, go back school. Good luck shit.  mitigated - can't say surprised looks like vaccinated 83% lower case rate. better expected. guess many unvaccinated belong specific socio-economic groups, causes exposed virus? Hmm always heard “the worms play pinochle snout”, might dad brother liked play pinochle. correct! kingdom lawyer use precedent legally end capitalism forever! Novavax based MoCo too, Gaithersburg iirc. People really good mask wearing they've always last withdraw mandates summer. think positivity rate around 2% whereas state overall hovering 5-6%. Living proof vaccines + masks working. Yeah idea applies past virus still alive. Virus rule book. whatever. become deadlier die, would one write getting deadlier. get weaker chance got chance talk tmhaving gotten weaker. logic getting weaker applies past virus killed us yet.  Eh, mean tuberculosis hang air 6 hours. 

There definitely diseases stay airborne like that, think it’s experts don’t want scare people already are.  sick dying staff won’t dwindle them?  Predating covid, large anti-vaccine portion ultra Orthodox Jews. cause major measles outbreaks US Israel. said likely related insular nature secular beliefs rather well founded religious beliefs.  Believe not, Sith understanding COVID spreads improved dramatically past year. know little risk contracting surface contact. overwhelming route transmission aerosol knowingly 

This operative word.

If make ""spreading crime"", considering vaccinated catch spread virus, make impossible anyone go outside ever. Actually yeah vaccines look ""relatório de vacinação"" get weekly vaccine reports age region. ECDC site find information European country used many vaccine.

For COVID numbers look ""Covid-19: relatório de situação"" get infographic per day. information vaccinated vs unvaccinated released.

As timelines, news website updates daily new figures hospitalisations, deaths, transmission rate, fatality rate, etc. virtually impossible trace infected covid.   mean 'matters?' Israel 78% Delta surge. start giving boosters every month virus disappears. Affects Covid vaccine contain fetal cells: fetal cell line used development testing.  Common medicines ""issue"": acetaminophen, albuterol, aspirin, ibuprofen, Tylenol, Pepto Bismol,  
Tums, Lipitor, Senokot, Motrin, Maalox, Ex-Lax, Benadryl, Sudafed,  
Preparation H, Claritin, Prilosec, Zoloft.

So person legitimate objections Covid vaccine reason also needs avoid medicines, well many others. Stupid you.   seems important point. PCR detects viral genetic material, viable virus. shedding lot antibody-impaired destroyed virus, connection apparent viral load communicability weakened. would great direct handle this, know that's practical. 

It seems clear vaccinated people *some* window shed live virus--and it, case Delta. window may far shorter, compared unvaxxed. timing type shot may important too. one month Moderna #2 #3 (bigger mRNA dose &amp; recent) probably far antibodies ready (and therefore less infectious briefer time) someone received 2x Pfizer single-shot J&amp;J 7 months ago, even T-cell immunity ultimately still protective severe illness people. really sounds like real reason voting anything spite Biden HHS getting ahead them.

They really touch reality. listened voting kept saying enough data certain group enough supply unvaccinated like backward thinking mask needed initial outbreak covid. need worry science instead logistic. It’s like author heard “bluffing” baffling choice exclude individuals high contact/high risk areas. staffing shortage places. using hospitalization risk factor completely undermines functionality places cannot afford people home. fine following science, looking data often leads black/white thinking without taking consideration nuance. drive i-90 corridor lot. seeing lot transport ambulances days. Human beings ownership bodies anymore want part society.

Amen! able go outside unload full magazine air every evening, too. kind live fear, stay home. 2nd Amendment guarantees it. mainly, press coverage implying vaccinated likely **catch** it. Covid still here, high vaccination rates, age brackets gone 1-2 levels average case severity, really.

Source live northern Idaho. Google support free press, smh  first half Hmm says 42.5 million cases (and believe people counted multiple times), 212 million vaccination (not exclusive cases, go that) gives 255 million. Compared population 328 million. Looks like there's plenty population left, even true cases substantially higher tested.  Vaccination rates highly correlated income. Simply put, unvaccinated people much money. target mandates hurts unvaccinated people economically. 

Policies force work good. Additionally, forcing pay higher healthcare premiums works. vaccine approved children 5-12 exclude children school unless vaccinated - need pay childcare adds another $200+ incentive per week vaccinate. religious exemption, IS, one who's received vaccines life eligible it, full stop.  makes feel less anxious ""What makes think Wuhan Institute Virology, world's largest coronavirus research facility, anything coronavirus outbreak first identified Wuhan?"" -literally China  I'm missing point... either clueless CDC/ FDAs recommendation

I telehealth visit doctor hour ago ask questions medication change asked getting booster i'm higher risk goes ""oh immunocompromised, high risk"" told ""no, overruled late last night"" also clueless Norway follow EU sure, probably actual implementation vaccine program evaluated based epidemic situation. R stays 1, I’m doubtful general rollout. Norway’s approach based health care situation. FWIW, add understanding here: Ct value ""cycle threshold"" positive result PCR testing (the gold standard terms detection sensitivity). 

The way works cycle boosts ""amplifies"" viral genetic material tested for, relative previous cycle, either (1) there's enough said material cause positive indication (2) max cycle cutoff reached (if go beyond limit, essentially amplifying random, low-level ""noise"" false positives). Typical cutoffs 35-40 cycles. also PCR testing rapid--it takes time cycles.

So relatively low viral load require many cycles amplification (higher Ct) producing positive. large load detectable much sooner (low Ct). obviously, higher viral load suggests greater infectiousness.

The Government launched new class facility - community treatment facilities (CTF), better equipped closer monitoring management Covid-19 patients chronic illnesses. first facility, site NTUC Health Nursing Home (Tampines), opened today.

MOH seeking help private sector hospitals Singapore Armed Forces help operate CTFs.

There 21 new cases ICU past week, nine preceding week.

As Singapore hospitals get ready almost 300 ICU beds short notice, sufficient current needs.

About 40 per cent infected persons currently recovering home, around 15-20 per cent hospital, rest community care facilities.

Can someone please explain how?

I impression vaccines simply Prime immune system combat virus faster catch it, hopefully eliminating multiplies becomes problem, get symptoms far less severe shorter period.

I see logical mechanism would prevent catching it. bad? Moderna effective longer though, may ok now. know I'm past six months Pfizer ton cases school, despite seeing kids every week, they'll never quarantine me. gonna go get vaxxed weekend can.

The virus causes disease successfully infects person.

The vaccine prevents virus infecting person disease never develops. Officially post everyday update information vaccinated/non-vaccinated Good. Health care workers people really need stay healthy possible vaccine longer everybody probably ""overdue"" already. talk boosters making ""hesitant"" people hesitant ridiculous IMO. They've ample time ""do research"" going move en masse they're required.

And selfish point view, I'd rather deal booster surge vaccines eventually approved 5-11 age range get kids promptly possible. think wrong assume exclusive anti-vaxxer rhetoric. fact said lot people support vaccination population still concerned abot many thinks as:

– people vaccinated health issues; possible herd imunisation Delta Variant; know symptoms Long Covid neurological system; Delta Variant still develop sub-variants bigger deffenses vaccines.

Vaccines helps lot reduce problems eliminate them. valid talk want people keep using masks public space rely vaccines alone.

Of couse anti-vaxxers use rethoric sipport politics. ignore important talks becase ignorant people distort it. feel like completely missed point post...

Things like met gala attendees vaccinated- every person worked vaccinated- much lower risk of....anything- never mind severe covid.

Gatherings organized afford check vaccination ensure attendees relatively low risk.

Gatherings guarantee majority vaccinated higher risk.

Gatherings vaccinated others higher risk.

Gatherings vaccinated neither attendees even higher risk.

You- vaccinated- going Met Gala- majority attendees vaccinated- relatively low risk.  going die? COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 virus.  COronaVIrus Disease.

The virus SARS-CoV-2 Anecdotal. Mom(pfizer 2 doses booster) tested negative(Yay!) CoVid whilst sister tested positive 2 days apart testing. live together 1 bedroom condo unit, isolation all.

Edit: sister symptomatic, cough fever, scary 2 days fine now. time last year, way vaccines, people made argument: masks prevent getting Covid. 
 
Technically true: wearing mask guarantee get Covid. numbers even close 100% effectiveness. 
 
But hide fact mask SIGNIFICANTLY reduces chance getting Covid. 
 
It's unfortunate see masks vaccines become political statements US. Europe fringe groups sure, large people happy wear masks vast majority happy get vaccine. think somewhat confused. Pre symptomatic people issue Delta (vs previously). Combine vaxxed confidence cannot spread, leads increased spread pre symptomatic stage. Yeah craziness going that’s definitely something I’ve considered well. hope it’s case don’t know kind feels like might be. end day, piece fabric. Like choosing wear hat. 100 percent true. ""Non-breakthrough"" infections carry Sars2 virus point, immune system ready, Sars 2 never reproduced person never got COVID.

So theory, even non breakthrough infections could potentially infectious small amount time.

The thing window infection amount virus small possibility passing is, practical purposes, almost 0. Yes difference infecting cells hopefully triggers immune system thus avoids proper Covid infection, symptomatic asymptomatic. sure done purpose ""scientists"" agenda.

They release knowing wrong, knowing retract it. also knowing already served purpose. Covid indeed running wild UK due relaxing essentially restrictions, following extremely successful vaccination campaign. results fairly stable excess death rate 10% past two months, due high vaccination rate. indicates sufficient vaccination, possible fully open society endemic Covid medium-high infection rates alongside possibly permanent 10% increase national death rate.

Not great, terrible.

When considering possible strategies, see lot countries choosing follow path. Good you? Exactly, like they’re using flawed HCQ study, scientist really need start sure shit start publishing it. understand mistakes happen time stupid shit like this. infection recently vaccinated, lot antibodies. new viral infection would shutdown extremely quickly. Maybe cells infected time, antibody levels drop system knows produce more. infection may take hold short period enough antibodies created. short period, might infectious typically sneezing coughing early thus chances low. unfortunate reality lot people country pretty valid historic reasons wary governmental medical institutions. clear, I’m talking idiots thin blue line flags bumper stickers crying vaccines even though they’re probably full already. think little empathy warranted.

I family semi-rural community bit trouble getting access vaccines fairly recently local clinic’s incompetence (the community quick response covid tests solid three four months recently). live suburb fairly major city there’s place every block handing like candy Halloween, genuinely case everywhere. Oh okay, COVID virus disease?   Soo stop? like someone saying ""Condoms prevent pregnancy"". Sure 100%, specious argument. qualified health workers

This also understood 'default' certain demographic. know dominant race.

Denying acknowledge minorities would relegate easily fearmongered  foreigners

So sad.

You want explain think 'Filipino' word 'low skill'?

NY willing replace healthcare workers alien parties nonachievers refuse establish public health BTW job.

How someone misinterpret headline lot.

Should locals worried foreigners take jobs?

If demote role healthcare worker, shall replaced.

The mindset make sense. said Filipinos implied low skill yet replace 'actual low skill workers' refuse covid shots.

How encourage people read full article? Much better relying headline. made day sir. guess they're isolationist design anyway. like disease widely spread them.  can’t read. could read would understand vaccines work. Honestly, idk many fire fighters DC hundreds seems like lower number anticipated. past week it’s become relatively easy get Australia. 

Before it’s like vaccination black market people yet eligible trying desperately get vaccine appointment. think single real life situation statement ""x always prevent y"" works. challenge prove wrong. become friends!!!! miss Farscape much! One time faves. John hero.  talking viral diseases distinction ""getting virus"" ""getting disease"". Vaccines prevent getting virus, prevent getting disease. even prevent getting virus, makes virus stays shorter time smaller quantities, that's prevents transmission lowers symptoms drastically.  Turns ""now now, kids"" tone bullshit work. knew? absolutely vaccinated measles America want attend public school. private schools too. There's list required childhood vaccines get places register. many workplaces require too. know told Americans vaccinate, always have. fringe antivaxxers refused vaccines usually homeschool isolated enclaves result. gross, fire Hi, I’m Filipino BSN (not RN, didn’t take licensure). 

Our clinical patient exposure starts Sophomore year, get full patient loads early Junior Year, hospitals gives us 5 patients per student nurse, literally everything except inserting IV (but supervision permission staff nurses). 4th year basically 3rd year independence. 

This may vary per school though   Damn.

""With latest deaths added, it’s confirmed 9,100 lives lost COVID-19 Florida August, deadliest month pandemic. amounts average nearly 295 per day."" Yeah course stopped kissing sex dates past year half. Right.

Even many ones make programs connections residency programs support navigated system prior. call stupid instead cautious already? Interesting, it’s fine don’t agree care, curious thought implications people around you? probably won’t die, chances spread someone else die critically sick, much higher individual chance sick own? (If get it, asymptotic spread 10 people, hugely increasing chance one 10 people get sick)

I don’t know you, elderly family people care about, vaccine protects you, others (and hugely significant way)

Same way seatbelts don’t save life, save passengers don’t become flying meat missile iirc PSU currently vaccine requirement, decent percentage campus vaccinated all. Big 10 schools well 90% vaccinated, fortunately.  kind stupid-ass fucking religion says get vaccinated?

And firefighters! Why? know corruption exists fire departments, makes sad. Egyptian one retracted fabricated data? keep getting people send one ""evidence"" understand ""retracted"" means.   Good luck gambling see body going react way want to. rather get vaccinated gamble life life others. Better cause fly breathe underwater? Yo watch dolphin bitches come!!  people general vicinity somewhere giving covid vaccinations last 5 months straight? Bullshit. Save empathy people deserve it. Ya got wrong idea mate. heard vaccine gives huge balls. Idk sounds fun me. /s /jk misleading say ‘it reduces chances getting COVID’, still get Covid, get smaller amount body deals straight away? Curious around wording, doesn’t form barrier mouth Covid can’t pass, stops Covid earlier body would without it? (I might wrong, also I’m anti-Vax, think it’s important clear messaging doesn’t federal government witbold money state amount. 20s vaccinated worry spreading COVID parents grandparents. rag named Lancet publish shitty study topic. could save another 20,000 lives year would willing get annual flu vaccine? mean politicized? places still smoke bars clubs. Lived Arkansas years surprised walked bar (came Maryland can't remember anyone smoking anywhere building for... Maybe 25 years?).  ""The implementation part going fraught complexity people best health literacy get boosters.""

That’s takeaway see. CDC concerned messaging, pandemic whole, be. Ha, think may researched stuff have. whole experience shown little anyone deserves trusted. Even comes definition. say I've safe, really means something entirely different people know. disturbing, - safe. like lack ability define terminology. again, maybe ignorance makes humanity possible. people shut small pox diseases, would happened. Maybe would led population without disease maybe would led less innovation. guess I'm saying whole thing massive global study group, people looking smart considerate. sounds much less messier.

Death one costs public health, hospitalization costs likely even larger first-world countries. costs exponentially distributed older people, know costs individually reduced 90% personal vaccination. sense vaccinating people 16-30 matter all, yet since they're eligible counted here.

But course, goal vaccination improve public health, also accomplished reducing cases. know COVID vaccines absurdly effective this, ongoing public cost COVID would dropped zero enough vaccination. vaccinate people 30, Delta we'd accomplished nearly everywhere. Post-Delta seemingly done places (Denmark, Bhutan, Japan), though it'll take months years find sustainable. mean, else get 75% obesity rates? I’m sorry don’t like answers.

It's deadly certain percentage population, percentage insignificant I’m vaccinated don’t think it’s worth use kn95s, etc others suggesting. use surgical masks.

I think current data shows surgical masks good KN95s; cloth masks without filter much worse, get KN95 filters cloth mask. actual correctly fitted N95 significantly better, requires proper training done lot work get effectively KN95. Fuck kids, right? shit. eradicated diseases vaccinations fucking different... Except actually active pandemic. responsibile, healthy adults able to.  Last year FL lull September November cases increased people congregated indoors. expect Delta come back.

But maybe 360 dead day like given many cases, deaths vaccinations had.

If young, healthy, vaxxed mask around people dont know - low-medium risk. I’m going pull not-the-same-thing card.

I think really good job threading complicated needle.

Those fully vaxed Pfizer (whether employed healthcare not) concerned risk self attest looks like fairly wide range health conditions go get booster.

But they’ve avoided making blanket recommendations (outside 65+) boosters aren’t supported risk/benefit data might complicate take resources away much impactful efforts vax 12+ 12s.

14.5 million doses given, 3 resulted death. death rate 0.00000021

42.5 mill cases COVID19 680k dead thats 1.6%

That means 7,619,047 times likely die COVID19 vaccine (keep mind, could made number WAY worse COVID19 vaccine deniers)

Small pox incoluation killed 2% people took it, smallpox killed 30%

Therefore incoluated vs small pox 15x safer getting small pox. means COVID19 vaccine least 507,936X safer George Washington ordered. suck, disappointment outweigh loss human life life-changing long-term side effects virus  Weird title.  could imagine many asshole readers would like ""I give crap Mexicans, old new"" I'm half Filipino.

Different vaccines differing levels efficacy different variant strains. Unfortunately AZ-only countries, AZ approximately efficacy category J&amp;J Delta (dominant strain many nations).

Moderna (mRNA) = 88-93% prevailing strains (88% Delta Mu, show highest escape risk far).

Pfizer (mRNA, though smaller dose &amp; closer spacing, slightly reduces efficacy durability, hence booster discussions) = 76-93% (again, Delta/Mu 76-80%, strains slide 95% max 93% 6 months 2nd dose, hence boosters).

J&amp;J/AZ (viral vector vaccine derived adenovirus filled COVID’s spike protein) = 60%-75% (Delta sits ~60% both).

SinoVac, Sputnik V/Light = &lt;50% (against Delta, questionable efficacy studied strains).

Covaxin, Soberana/Abdala, et al = Limited data peer-reviewed/independent sources.

The difference efficacy avoid broadly discussing breakthrough cases. Given varied risk breakthrough, population heavily reliant “less reliable” vaccine (still significantly better remaining unvaxxed!), breakthrough rate higher, cause concern (only cause higher vaccination rates needed greater diversity vaccine type elevated risk population). totally contradicts article. headline misleading.""Additionally, instances vaccinated person getting breakthrough case, yes, infectious unvaccinated person."" fair, easier hide tracking chip pill vaccine.

I think Ireland like 30 deaths per week reported right US reports around 14000 deaths per week moment. Ireland would population US would equal 2000 deaths per week, far less 14000 deaths US currently per week.

I know differences testing. idea US tests I'm even entirely sure Ireland tests moment. know right school children tested week something. Otherwise people test voluntarily, sent hospital close contacts positive cases symptoms. think close contacts tested symptoms I'm entirely sure.

For US idea testing. 

Also yes Trump said slow testing less cases. many cases pandemic obviously made look bad wanted less testing look bad. Also way right though, thorough test cases find. Like test 100 people may find 1 case. test 100,000 people may find 1000 cases. test entire population may find million cases whatever depending population size. basic maths testing reveal cases, less testing means less confirmed cases. sense right.

The reason delta breakthrough infections ""vaccine resistant"" - higher viral load higher viral shedding rate variants - therefore, like difference swimming swimming pool filtered salt (not salty) swimming ocean (much salty) salt virus itself.

There virus air delta, means much easier become infected since higher initial ""dose"" virus.

Finally, DELTA variant specifically, vaccine, much higher risk infection vaccinated individual, much higher risk complications vaccinated individual, especially immune system tuned attack spike protein - immune system take much longer respond new DELTA variant seen before.

Saying infected covid makes immune someone vaccine like saying ""I got flu last year, need shot year"" - shows fundamental misunderstanding Covid vaccines work, covid virus variants infect, spread, mutate, cause disease.  Tried link, teacher 6mo initial vaccination, filling form got response:  CDC recommendations, patients immunocompromised aren’t recommended get additional dose time.

Looks like they're scheduling new plan yet, previously approved one.

Saying infected covid makes immune someone vaccine like saying ""I got flu last year, need shot year"" - shows fundamental misunderstanding Covid vaccines work, covid virus variants infect, spread, mutate, cause disease. sick politicians pandering morons.
Past time get shut down,and dealt like idiots are.  Many renowned experts prestigious universities facebook twitter might disagree one. true. understood aspect someone Provincetown regular called local NPR station explain activities could lead viral spread. said apart masking people going back old partying ways. stupid argument. either-or. Therapeutics save lives people who've vaccinated still get COVID-19 risk--mostly elderly people immune disorders--as well children young vaccinated. apartment cow go exercise?  Agreed. They're fahrbot anyhow. Looks like Walgreens [taking students accomplishing pre-covid whose dad going pay lawyer fees frat?? Maybe Google's subscription NYT ran out. Please do. ICUs many areas full unvaccinated COVID patients. leave, ICU space becomes available resist vaccine. I'm fully vaxxed tested positive couple days ago. I'll take pill means less time spent isolation testing positive.   won't. people need understand uses use properly live. people use still refuse get vaccinated continue die. better exist to.

My whole point provide people excuses get vaccinated operate society. Putting larger populace risk. 

We reflect mutations immunocompromised people see should, go problems. 

The whole argument used way reduces whole point trying accomplish result net negative society inevitably gets used incorrectly. think mixing several ideas, although understand anxiety.

First, vaccines effective, people get vaccinated. Vaccines effective \*me\*, reduce direct COVID risk 20x so; however, risk also depends overall levels; risk right (I'm GA) something like 5x risk two months ago, since 5x many cases.

Moreover, indirect risk, due ER/ICUs full (and healthcare system strained) huge now, since full.

The world changed (we new, highly infectious disease), behavior change. schools, work, concerts. rocket science. We're still sure ought change, reached steady state. steady state also depends collective behavior (there always vaccinated unvaccinated people, proportions distribution matter ... 95% vaccinated different 40% ...

It probably take year two, might end different steady states different regions country/world, figure out. There's requirement guarantee exactly 2019. tax payer gets put debt people go hospital… wife got vaccinated 32 35 weeks pregnant Phizer also breastfeeds. Wish could convince healthcare provider give antibody test. respect decision completely. offered booster, take it. unvaxxed child (too young) working at-risk population hospital setting soon. want part slow spread keep healthy stable supply hospital workers. Everyone situation reasons. I'm recommended booster whatever reason, I'm ok too. sound bad let people chose vaccinated die off? crazy. sort genetic component covid susceptibility? Literally else would called defeated  need stop bullshit messaging. 

The vaccine force field. nose plug. physical barrier prevents virus entering airways breathe.

You will, vaccinated person, breathe virus. That's unavoidable. 

Except vaccinated person, body immediately goes work. Antibodies bind virus - makes inert. start releasing neutralizing antibodies huge scale. 

People seem ignore evidence virus emitted vaccinated people either antibody bound, completely neutralized therefore can't infect all, much sicker less effective. fuck Grandma Uncle Billy Bob whose overweight

Got  Yeah… many idiotic phrases heard much of. one person job unvaccinated person want put anything body 100% on. get that; really do. maybe also fly Florida take kids Disney World week. told show negative test returning work. think many unvaccinated people posturing. all, people waiting full FDA approval change minds happened. talking points gravitate socially acceptable reasons getting vaccinated completely untrue. short months ago would made sad. I'm fully ambivalent. person foolish enough refuse free, safe, effective vaccine doubly foolish enough believe doctors trying kill them, probably stay home snort Ivermectin. helping themselves, society. would hope could unintentional bias reading hearing it. imagine aware ongoing studies relevant pre-prints released.      someone cant bothered shot think bothered take pill prolonged period time?

I can't tell future. people already proven operate sound logic. Maybe pill come two day hangover? There's data yet. Also TREAT covid already it, take before. still catch covid great people need realize human nature. people either take pill take little bit time. 

Again, can't tell future. People likely familiar popping things every day life like tylenol rather getting shot. cares people take little bit time? Would rather exist people take use result exact opposite trying accomplish.

No won't. people need understand uses use properly live. people use still refuse get vaccinated continue die. better exist to.  State 4 still pretty rare delta.

State 3 seem uptick, though it’s still far lower unvaccinated Guess helps look bright side. Still gonna wear mask. truly matter ""who"" blame fact blame *not* individuals. seems MedArxiv conclusions transmission flawed? I’m kinda baffled reading decision got turned head. within police POWER STATE

This *super* misleading it’s wiped context.

Meaning,

**1.** Federal law trumps local law. State law cannot supersede federal law. case, federal law state law didn’t contradict federal law. (Of course.)

**2.** Regardless whether it’s state federal mandate, still must constitutional applied fairly. (Of course.)

Nobody airport kind checks. walked airport unquestioned. many lives might save forcing people take vaccine, many lives cost otherwise would okay? intricacies vaccine dangers complex statistics deserve credit ""vaccine sideffects negligible therefore ignored"".

When consider that:
 - vaccine fully prevent infection transmission, question still often breaks through

 - % population can't vaccine small

 - % actually catch virus small R rate suppressed cases driven down

 - % get virus vaccine, later hospitalised die, also small (though immune suppressive comorbidities bring little)

 - variants likely imported countries higher case rates, opposed arising domestically

And yes, vaccine rare relevant, potentially lethal side courts enforce mandate many factors limited disputed evidence relation them, seems little problematic make judgement call cost people's bodily autonomy.  uhm bad news there. Coronaviruses reinfect.  works, friend. onus proof claimant. Seems way high.

Israel double population, 60% fully vaxxed death rate 7,000 per year seems going down.

So NZ less half that, maybe 2,500-3,000 year. side note, AAPI broad term - region AAPI-Americans hail home half humans Earth, region geographically stretches thousands miles directions Either way, there's conflict. Either overruling CDC advisory committee, CDC committee overruling FDA committee (who unanimous support that, narrow 6-9 vote). 

So there's option pit one group damage public health confidence. concern message sent unvaccinated needed boosters, completely failed take account significance overruling FDA. Chili's restaurant nearby, there's ghost kitchen called *It's Wings* get deep fried Oreos from. Via DoorDash.

(I'm sick timeline) case sure. Unvaccinated young people definitely causing problem North presumably high transmission age group. really matters hospitalisations. Covid would never problem, infected people nothing else. antivaxxers say… see it’s like flu like we’ve telling you. Philippines healthcare capacity issues back home? 

My concern good lot respects (more healthcare staff NY, better pay healthcare workers), would essentially become NY state outbidding Philippines healthcare staff (especially region less access vaccines thus vulnerable outbreak)?   There's one thing bothers though. totally agree society generally laws let everyone life freely without compromising someone else's freedom. Makes sense. born society, kind choice. wish way someone opt-out. want get vaccinated? Cool, can't walk around risking everyone's lives. choose go live ""that place"" rules whatever want. 


I kind feel like every state needs allocate large ""lawless"" portion people want live rules option go live somewhere else.  


No comments plausibility please. We've seen movie Escape New York. I'm proposing lawless land would work. use example sort ""opt out"" option think need. need say ""Sorry born here, like it? totally respect right Opt Out. Sign get plane.""    PNAS 😂 Exactly.

The CDC FDA go get fucked. Every rational person get booster, benefits might big small, cost/risk nothing.

Here's WaPo says panel also said younger people, 18 49 years old underlying medical conditions, **may assess risk choose get booster want CDC panel parted FDA pivotal issue: declined recommend booster people risk illness job.

It laughable tragic badly CDC FDA fucking up.

Assess risk choose get booster want one? utterly bonkers. idiots go get screwed, get booster. natural infection acquired immunity fetish among COVID skeptic/anti-vaxx movement study Israel showed people recovered COVID got reinfected much lower rate people double vaxxed never infected.

So now, people decided best way get COVID get COVID.  Retail pharmacies area? assume varies place place?

Either way worst thing could happen get shot. call police uncle. remember finding Plague Inc internet playing work collegue covid hit Italy. Mind you, IRL humans even worse AI running humans game!

Reduction cases reduction hospitalizations/deaths entirely different metric, total eligible vaccinations matter former. advocating skipping process wholly dangerous. Even given, reasons protocols exist safety kids. There's reason rush anything especially Pfizer yet even submit data review Right, he’s shameless, shellfish opportunist. knows better too, makes particular kind evil. Oh well anyways I'm sure does. clear public health officials ae concerned unvaccinated adults particularly worried children getting ill infected.

Thankfully Supreme Court interpret matters way do. think concern insufficient data myocarditis following 3rd dose young adults (especially males),

I seen nothing shows bigger risk third dose second CDC recommends second everyone age 12.

The vaccines overwhelmingly safe every dose. Millions upon millions people gotten them. risks well known. 

I think point object evidence increased risks. public health emergency, normal situation take time looking peer reviewed data. US danger WWII. Pearl Harbor reacted heavy handedly general want part it. still NK, China places smoker (and kind still smoker now) smoking bans fantastic. love going outside smoke love reek smoke get home bar. vaccines work, danger?

If vaccines don’t work, get them?

I stayed home lockdown, got vaccines, idc others don’t want get it. I’m safe now, not, fucking could. Quit nonsense.

This fucking respect bodily autonomy.

You can’t eradicate covid. It’s almost worse global warming needing collective effort get fixed, never fucking happen.

In Denmark, vaccine rates stopped 75% now.

I’ll think find country reaches 90% Which, ironically, 2 **more** number lives *saved* COVID Ivermectin. That’s less steady pipeline century 👌 Ah, Kraken Method^tm legal interpretation. Find sentence like run it. Yeah, system, lack of, place US, cat pretty much already bag.

It tricky situation due many unvaccinated people probably needing protect vulnerable more. data clear many groups lot immunological questions unanswered. best time boost maximum effect flu season? look influenza, many old people get couple months high protection. schedule right one best longer lasting immunity? vaccines work 6 month gap, others 12 months something else. short might actually worse off. also consider vaccines could used elsewhere know would great effect reducing suffering death.

This considered think experts trying that. Everyone would want giving boosters everyone might silver bullet made be. vaccinated, generally feel protected hope enough people follow suit actually stop hospitals overcrowding. Boosters protect vulnerable people get immunity one way other.  65 year old sister COPD verbally accosted today Kroger wearing mask. said guy like Paul Bunyon,, well 6 feet yelling top lungs wearing mask. vaccinated still doesn’t feel safe enough. one’s gonna wear defend her. scared stood crowded store one mask took mask religious reason. Whoever puts trust Allah sufficient. religion tells put trust God alone. 🎶 worms crawl in, worms crawl 🎶  I've using Ivermecrin talking point, research show prescribed doctor human doses statistically significant effect reducing time hospital chance death 15-30%, 1.15 1.5 times less likely. another treatment reduces things 10-20 times, treatment ask? vaccine!!!!! much am. 4 weeks they'll administer 2nd dose. 1 dose better nothing. Philippines. can’t use raw numbers comparing negative outcomes vaccinated vs. unvaccinated groups. Since PR high vaccination rate (69.2% total population fully vaccinated, #1 US), much likely see greater percentage total cases/hospitalizations/deaths vaccinated people. 

In order compare two populations, need use standardized metric number cases per 100,000 vaccinated unvaccinated people. also say 50% deaths days vaccinated people—you can’t go day day, go 7 14 day rolling average. 

I don’t read Spanish can’t math you. But, 69% population fully vaccinated truly 50% deaths past 2 months vaccinated people, [the Implied Vaccine Effectiveness tells us unvaccinated people 2.2 times likely die vaccinated one. But, again, need looking deaths delta wave (so many deaths vaccinated v. unvaccinated since, say, July 1? I’d **very** surprised 50% time frame) run Calculator say numbers really show here. Well, let's see...

1). Troubles still thing 30 years ago. course based Northern Ireland negative effects also spilled Republic. 

2). economy getting stronger 1991, historically Republic Ireland consistently weak economy independence least 1980s. 

3). Catholic Church still way much influence Irish society Irish government. Like shitty economy, Church another thing dragging Ireland since 1920s.

Then, last 30 years, Irish managed break toxic stranglehold Church them, also ending (though, God knows, N.I. still problems) Troubles Good Friday accords, somehow establishing type strong economy eluded 60+ years.

IMO, thirty years ago Ireland languishing, since independence. country seem deal problems. Then, relatively short period, completely turned around. rare countries that, IME. impressive, too. refuse Covid shot qualified health care half means absolutely nothing pulled context..... past week absolute nightmare people involved planning logistics trying get booster shots administered timely fashion... *So many* changes messaging recommendations... stories Provincetown also failed mention areas mostly spot people going clubbing. vaccine much making random strangers. coughed somebody COVID positive, long story, despite vaccinated, scared. relieved tested negative multiple times coming quarantine... VACCINES WORK! Sure, they're 100%, I'll take odds vaxx COVID. horrible idea. Spread continues accounts, 1 month away able vaccinate children. Norway currently plateauing cases surge Norway pay price later vs. kept measures place least kids vaccinated. Ideally keeping measures place winter season.  second largest Air Force world American Navy I'd rather SWAT public servant providing real numbers.  question. I'm currently isolating testing positive breakthrough case covid. mild far, day 6. caught early possibly could immediately isolated family, mask protocol, etc.

Do continue isolating full ten days remaining symptom fatigue? fever since day 2. 

My partner vaccinated six year old not. difficult stay isolated kiddo. obviously keep protect long need wish clear guideline contagious vaccinated people testing positive recovering covid's worst symptoms. thread there's someone screaming STAY HOME folks went Met Gala. Land Shark.  I’ve corona, JJ Moderna. better simply Moderna x2? studies linked showed, still able infect people. Albeit maybe lesser amounts time, nothing shows contagious even asymptomatically, didn’t show sterilizing immunity like lots vaccines have. concept doesn’t apply here.

I understand desire want get back normalcy etc, current vaccines aren’t solving alone. reopened way soon. Poor rabbits. toxic safety rhetoric ""We need shiver fear home nothing absolutely 100% effective"" 

I never encountered attitude even one single person either online meatspace.

One piece advice consistent since early days pandemic *go outside*. transmission outside rare. spending time outside good physical mental health. Seriously, fuck up?... Talk looking completely incompetent.  Obviously ever wore N95 mask took social distancing extreme would close 100% effective, comparing interventions practice think strong correlation COVID cases per million county-level vaccination rates shows vaccination indeed best protection have. States mandating masks capacity limits last winter still saw huge wave cases. health network around scheduling appointments people ""if [their] doctor believes would beneficial."" So, might already able to, doctor believes that...Just saying. Check local health network. delay approving shot kids what's stopping vaccine effective. 

This something people asking questions about. urgency researching whether vaccines suitable children? pretty irresponsible re-open schools vaccine available children. 4 pills lot though one day, everyday. don’t mind much . anti-viral pills this? you’re vaccinated approximately 1/3 likely get COVID.

You 1/8 likely symptomatic illness.

You 1/25 likely hospitalized.

But infected, 50% likely get Long COVID. could mean hospitalization later date.

So you’re obviously much better shape vaccinated, really need masking distancing well. vaccine panacea. It’s tool.  I'm glad see finally working something like this. feel like talking much vaccine. I'm sure ""anit-vax"" crowd still convinced pill works. new variant hits render vaccines less effective.

And hospitals losing staff, there's capacity new surge. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Also, it’s looking like 5 age group dose going 3mcg - we’ll able vaccinate 10 children 1 adult dose. regard immunity, natural immunity equally good. dangerous path get there.

[1] Unfortunately, think there’s much information cram headline here. says article infected people, vaccinated not, likely spread virus, least first. say vaccinated people likely spread virus isn’t totally wrong. 

I guess it’s accurate say infected, vaccinated people likely spread virus unvaccinated people first part infection, vaccinated people far less likely get infected first place. spread coronavirus, coronavirus

So breakthrough cases lead transmission vaccinated people, according posted Atlantic article. However, thought concern confusion originated report said viral loads vaccinated people high unvaccinated thought making case high viral load reason high transmission rates Delta variant - regardless whether actually ""have"" sense gotten ill it.

This article yet completed peer-review picked media impression responsible interpretation vaccinated people likely spread coronavirus unvaccinated people. seems bit weird median age males reporting myocarditis study releatively high. younger ages included? Maybe number would higher.  got wrong number many vaccines administered Ottawa area period covered study. explanation happened vaccine data still coming in. thinking thinking. obvious stand right now. conversation next year time, would went completely differently.  mean sounds like you’re good go haha Well, reopening gradual process severest restrictions lifted last spring. nice people able attend concerts, nightclubs, football matches etc. without restrictions, everyday life pretty normal already. terms fatalities less 500 &lt; 18 age group, 680k overall covid fatalities 0.07%. population 74 million kids 0.0007%.

For comparison 3 times many kids die swimming pool accidents per year. Thankfully, kids seem largely unaffected. follow “Sometimes wish I’d never born all”?  Need start filling darts vaccine shots, drive around blowgun. Hypothetically, yes. question is, actually happening. article claims 

“Despite concern waning immunity, vaccines provide best protection infection. someone isn’t infected, can’t spread coronavirus.” provide studies back claim.

The best protection infection, far aware remains: Wearing masks, washing hands social distancing. Yea, I'm teacher know struggle someone gets breakthrough case need someone supervise class two weeks (sometimes teacher teach home, sometimes not). people taking care everyone getting sick get one....who steps takes job two weeks? know roving/sub nurses, healthcare anything like education moment, impossible find someone step in. would want make sure healthcare workers keep working?? live mask mandate recently re-introduced (despite 0 people hospital time) sort thing pro-vaccine pro-mask people saying. 

It's anti-vax saying it. difficult person fined $5000 jailed would stop happens one two them. Look need know I’m wrong right tell people still spread get even vaccinated. Like mother thinks get covid still leave house sick. biggest issue wrong, regardless. seen nothing anyone (including Scott G example) suggests shot withheld US = shot administered Africa. IIRC even said work way. much goes around logistics everything, stockpiling requirements, simply allow this. Yet argument (IMHO) bad faith scientific community (WHO) looking surface level. Basically optics it. fact withhold shots here, ultimately ended sitting around, would damn travesty.  [pastafarians /s get shot peeps  think lot get unvaccinated first shot. mandates, outreach, information campaigns, mobile vaccine trucks, etc. almost like ""get vote"" campaign. people still reluctant reason getting needs concerted effort reach them. Countries higher vaccination rates things.

Biden's mandates great step see much resistance new vaccinations still coming trickle. population would far better 10-20% people got first shot boosters rolled out. You’re welcome! Pfizer even applied vaccine kids yet...

There delay approving Canada Health... Pfizer even submitted something approve yet! 

That coming soon though. disenrolled like that.....or expelled, still hook student loans?


Split difference taking $25,000 year get yanked failing take vaccine get test. that’s bad message public vaccinated people get Covid understand still transmit virus quarantining. likely intention. 

It’s easy take statements like assign different meanings them. Wearing mask risk harm, goes along many restrictions. example schools react various different drastic ways case found, sometimes kid quarantined, miss school 1-2 weeks, plus maybe everyone they've exposed etc. significantly disrupting schools education, again. Many activities can't happen like entertainment sports whatever. simply wearing mask.

I agree message vaccines absurdly mixed. First say amazingly effective, vaccinated people still restrictions precautions unvaccinated. simply make sense science perspective. policy ever change? 5, 10, 20 years still mix vaccinated unvaccinated people. disrupt schools forever? like official statement rolled vaccine? something media mentioned. can't really speak absolutes sometimes, saying something like lowers chance getting X% would likely swayed people lot saying still get it/spread it.   look like Puerto Rico fairly high vaccination rates. many age groups 80% fully vaccinated: people vaccinated, percentage deaths vaccinated higher, too.

If population 100% vaccinated, logically 100% covid deaths vaccinated people. I’ve discussed ad nauseum I’m going go deep again, clearly considering plenty non-science aspects situation.

They also cut one doctors obviously make motion recommendation healthcare workers (which would good chance passing) abruptly ended meeting gone over. Sorry, staying zoom extra hour get right, align intent eua fda’s advisory committee fda specifically made way include healthcare workers, much inconvenience, find relaxing committee join. Lol. tired. probably eating ants instead vaccinating know. Yeah guess may mistook said. already hear anti-vaxxer would respond saying ""ok healthy hospitalized ANYWAY covid, what's point taking vaccine?"" (To clearly wrong assumption I've heard often) TLDR version wrong initial calculation 25-fold off? That's compact dense package idiocy one find.

Hope knew wiring job. recognize TSR lol You’re aquarium enjoying nice afternoon watching sharks swim around. suddenly glass gives scared shark lands directly top bites neck off. edit changed 100,000 25,000 :) certainly similar thought process view. almost straw poll asking people similar questions... 1 25,000 general population suppose. high risk groups? mean 16-30 males. “Ant-Vaxxers”?, micro dosing Ivermectin now? Personally I'm 100% board booster train, completely believe Biden administration correct regard able easily provide enough boosters still meeting exceeding promises developed world. lets face it, regardless ""we enough data"" comments circles, real reason strong push stop US administering boosters.

That said break protocol fuel antivaxx fire. doubt antivaxx/conservative circles pushing today huge blow ""follow science"". Yes, immunity terms vaccines interchangable invincible. confused, problem? trying ask questions dick it? HVAC guy come house think safe covid wife vaccinated. Still trying figure one out. Like, dude, go random peoples' houses intention masking... Saying protestants think pope anti christ lol Unrestrained occupants turn deadly ping pong balls crashes. purely symbolic, dangerous. 

You're healthcare worker, get booster, reduce risk asymptomatic transmission others even further. video two doctors explaining transmission delta vaccinated people. bring breakthrough case viral production issue. data shows vaccinated breakthrough case get virus quicker overall produce less virus.

Discussing transmission delta vaccinated peak transmission Active inactive want semantic. Good. legit 1st people vaccinated. waning immunity, they'll feel first. insane advisory panel consider them. also straight can't afford breakthrough cases enough people working jobs anymore keep need recover covid instead working. Totally agree. vaccines really working well breakthrough cases rare occur, rarely severe. What's more, many healthcare workers quitting. Denying boosters would drive even quit, making worker shortage even worse.  Antivaxxers spread argument dumb understand two things possible, mean they're equally likely. That's say stuff like ""If still get covid vaccinated, what's point"" understand nuance able understand less likely less severe.

We unsurprisingly stopped going church soon after. 30-yr old, healthy, previous COVID infection (November) plus fully vaccinated Pfizer (2nd shot April). I’ll attending convention November Boston (highly vaxxed, cold weather). get booster? good too. Anything medically certified modern country probably fine. quickly wrapped cremated after, no.  Whoa, lecture drywall guy. gave anti vaxxers excuse get vaccinated. themselves, I'd say let it, dependent care high risk. Worse, threatening medical staff beyond disgusting. people literally trying save people  You’ll fine give people excuse get vaccinated. Fauci also said that's highly unlikely happen though. new variant would completely change spike protein structure fully get around vaccines essentially become different virus  Shit...maybe I'm misremembering. seem low. Delta, are/were estimating efficacy 59-79%, 95% original strains. saw people saying 10x thread, hell...now I'm sure. 

It's not-insignificant difference regardless course. Tillykke Norge! thing is, even true, that's reason get vaccinated. vaccinated people keep spreading, get ill, they'll spread unvaccinated people.

If thinking selfishly reason get vaccinated. reminder say there's ""no benefit"" benefit they're talking preventing severe covid/hospitalization death. That's it. members strongly opposed kept reminding people thing they're supposed considering whether evidence showed need regards hospitalization. ones opposed saying there's benefit preventing infections knock butt week, spreading others, preventing long covid, prevent whatever long term effects damage yet understand... *only* thing they're basing decision hospitalization/death. obvious long list problems believe there's wide divide among experts there's obviously little data showing people 50 risk hospitalizations.

A number panel members also obviously convinced widespread boosters would undermine campaign get remaining unvaxxed first two. clearly influencing votes, evidence that's true virtually non-existent, consisting poll 1/3rd said would increase hesitance, there's good reason distrust honesty. also failed take account overruling FDA would also seriously undermine trust recommendations.

Finally, hard take claim risk seriously BMI 25 hypertension enough change risk/benefit equation. data there's elevated risk; data shows similar 2nd shot. risk applies 18-20 males. Finally one time, remember, avoiding covid together *not* benefit far ones saying there's benefit concerned.

Niels Bohr, Nobel laureate Physics father atomic model, quoted saying, “Prediction difficult, especially future!” People also animals Mutant strains occur commonly areas low levels medical infrastructure rampant reproduction across large population infected individuals allows higher amount genetic diversity.

People getting vaccines cause potentially potent strains, high levels vaccinated individuals naturally select potent strain. 

It also force virus predictable cycle, like flu vaccines.

The alternative obviously much worse: building zero preemptive immunity disease like live third world country. Good! local clinic anti vaccine strike, going anymore.

It’s frustrating argument, tries spin like people actually enjoy crap comes pandemic basically realistic it. I’d like emphasize people think evidence “boosters don’t work,” man never received booster.

Immunocompromised people need 3 injections considered fully vaccinated create sufficient antibodies, whereas average people need 2. High five! Masks indeed fashionable. I’d like emphasize people think evidence “boosters don’t work,” man never received booster.

Fauci admitted lied issue.

First, emergency like this, can't *follow* science takes enormous amount research. public health agencies need make bold decisions cut red tape without data want time = people's lives. need get ahead science.

Unfortunately recommendation probably even narrow since that's lasting longer. good lasting longer, *is* starting drop little, maybe something *before* shitload people wind hospitalized know coming? 

Also reason Moderna half dose boosters (if get one later, officially approved)... higher dose probably holding better knows they're that. Sell doses probably. certainly run study better; tested 50ug booster. data Israel, really dumb?

“The CDC analyzed risk-benefit trade-off found every million doses administered mRNA COVID-19 vaccines people ages 12 29, approximately 6 deaths, 138 ICU admissions, 560 hospitalizations 11,000 infections COVID-19 avoided,” notes. “**This comes ‘cost’ 39 47 cases myocarditis, almost mild cause long-term heart problems.** Strictly considering myocarditis risk ignoring severe problems COVID-19, people 25 years old 7 37 times likely get myocarditis infection COVID-19 vaccine.”

So, males 12-29, expect 39 47 cases per MILLION vaccines. mild. peace mind (and extra protection exposed COVID 19, far outweighs minuscule risk getting myocarditis. confused.

Federal government.

That’s untrue. I’m kinda baffled reading [*Jacobson v got turned head.

*Jacobson* essentially says three things: 

1. Federal law trumps local law. State law cannot supersede federal law. case, federal law state law didn’t contradict federal law. (Of course.)

2. Regardless whether it’s state federal mandate, still must constitutional applied fairly. (Of course.)

3. States enforce local state mandates. (Of course states would enforce federal mandates, like OSHA anything else.)

There’s nothing says implies states create/enforce mandates.

Like, all.

Here’s legal United States derive substantive powers Preamble Constitution. cannot exert power secure declared objects Constitution unless, apart Preamble, power found in, properly implied from, express delegation spirit Constitution respected less letter, spirit collected chiefly exclusion evidence state court case involving constitutionality state statute may strictly present Federal question, court may consider rejection evidence upon ground incompetency immateriality statute showing scope meaning opinion state police power State embraces reasonable regulations relating matters completely within territory, affecting people States, established directly legislative enactment, protect public health local regulation, even based acknowledged police power State, must always yield case conflict exercise General Government power possesses Constitution, mode manner exercising police power wholly within discretion State long Constitution United States contravened, right granted secured thereby infringed, exercised arbitrary oppressive manner justify interference courts prevent wrong liberty secured Constitution United States import absolute right person times, circumstances, wholly freed restraint, element liberty one person, minority persons residing community enjoying benefits local government, power dominate majority supported action authority within police power State enact compulsory vaccination law, legislature, courts, determine first instance whether vaccination best mode prevention smallpox protection public obvious reasons exception, fact children, certain circumstances, excepted operation law deny equal protection laws adults statute applicable equally adults like highest court Massachusetts held compulsory vaccination law State establishes absolute rule adult must vaccinated even fit subject time vaccination would seriously injure health cause death, court holds that, adult residing community, fit subject vaccination, statute invalid derogation rights person Fourteenth case involves validity, Constitution United States, certain provisions statutes Massachusetts relating actually know, federal government played games freeway funds get states fall line substantial amount money.  long N95. Evidence others help scant best, since mask wearers also social distance even instructed to. Cloth masks may actually harmful.

So population level, mask usage large boon, nothing else prompts people remember precautions. makes sense mandate masks antisocial people find justification self righteous wearing mask. surprised, signed protect serve, cops exempt military required.  Yep, I’ve known way many teachers getting breakthrough cases last weeks still unvaccinated kids home classroom full them. Agreed. would much effective almost employers required it.  they? mean, seems optimal, worry devil details.  one thing 1 employer requires it. another almost do. case anyone thinks US-only phenomenon, I’ve back office part time couple times, know I’m working largest concentration antivaxx Western Europe. 

Even overheard story horse dewormer much better vaccine. argument seems vaccine made make covid passports compulsory. unvaccinated idiot barber cut hair things I've said publicly remain unvaccinated. I'm complaining. I'll go somewhere else lol harder americans get Canada almost country world... infact want say hardest -- need highly specialized skill come america, people arent going quit high paying jobs come lmao understandable parent want get child vaccines want deal little bit crying/complaining/whatever.

It's ok internet person. I'm sure never kid based comments. nice paper I'm saying - understand different making decision v.s. little hesitation someone care yourself.

You've blocked. Serial passage would make LESS likely infectious is.

Why?

If pass cells again, gets better infecting cells dish expense good passing person person. Clearing loooot problems one go :D guess needed dichotomy choices. *Would rather lick truckstop toilet seat get vaccinated.*  easy imagine aliens sent covid first, follow invasion. Imagination integrated brain thing mind uses fill gaps, follow facts, proof, dismiss speculation. default picture zoo. pick photo link.... Yeah we're missing pig going OSHA thing, they'll enforce way enforce everything else. think front-line, front-line. one going question you. important work feel risk, go get it. sick sensational articles. 

First all, article says:
""Ivermectin almost exclusively used treat parasites horses cattle and, rare instances, humans. ""

Rare instances? used treatment humans livestock, used 250 million people worldwide yearly basis treat parasitic infections. (Hardly rare). 

Also according article, New Mexico poison control 20 reports exposure, double normal. (not all) related Covid. 10 usual, even related Covid?

So story entire state, 8 people contacted poison control exposure ivermectin due covid?

And two died, one battling severe Covid? sure died ivermectin OD? article even admits hardly anything known deaths?

People actually going tractor supply stocking livestock medication going deterred article like this. articles like lower normal people's trust media. girlfriend vaccinated ended ventilator that's killing liver. Covid accelerated process much faster abating it. got tested even covid, despite living together. agree rule out. Also believe keepers alwho federal employees mandated federal deadline. yeah would rather millionaire poor dont see million $ That's narrator. also thinking along lines, put words -- yes, innumeracy. stop think ballpark number ought be, grabbed number seemed right public health database. long mean lick pre 2000s way. Anti-vaxxers lying sacks shit principals? Color surprised. stack up:

Vaccinated ? Then: 5 * 7 * 10 = 350 times less likely die covid vaccinated.. possible beyond usual birds fitting migratory pattern? bird caught spring, spent summer Wuhan, passed fall migrated back south? bird got eaten dog passed human owner Wuhan. possible?! That’s good point. probably tone vaccine rhetoric, I’m pretty sure I’ve offended people casual conversations saying things like “selfish unvaccinated fucking assholes” like. good way ensure shortage people drive quite telling can't protect themselves. Lots healthcare workers quitting right they've overbullshitted underslept. CDC’s committee outside advisers voted recommend boosters based occupation. vote binding CDC. advisory.

The head CDC approved recommendation/allowance (varies group) boosters various groups including high risk exposure occupations. HIV first found California, no? two ferns say? whoever enforces state law also antivaxx, national guard step state still left own? innumeracy. people, numbers hard, especially big numbers, sense things. see 30K think, big number, probably right, without sense 30K get doses half population, like occurring then. Hey, least it'll free hospital beds. likely == maybe possibly. bozos dont know numbers work. Moderna approved 18 Australia? Everyone’s got plan they’re punched mouth You’re right. studies show people wearing masks reduces spread COVID. [However aren’t studies show surgical team wearing masks surgery reduces rate post-op says vaccine untested experimental I'm pretty sure *can* understand concepts given frequently lean """"""13%"""""" 

At point, deliberate. convince amount facts. won’t granted dual citizenship. You’ll give american want Canadian passport. American ex pat living Canada. 

If weren’t born dual citizen aren’t obscenely wealthy sports star/celebrity ever getting dual US/Ca citizenship. Vaccine helps train body fight virus.

Vaccine keep anyone covid free. This. not.

It spreading around people poorly interpreted Idaho's crisis care standards. allow implementation universal DNR necessary; however, instituting standards trigger universal DNR. would health system decide needed implemented based shortage staff ventilators, etc far none done working vaccination nurse, always extra proud supportive patients admitted terrified needles, still wanted shot. It’s true bravery face fears!

I don’t recommend Xanax unless get ride home, though! goverment enforcing mandated vaccines longer country. simply public health issue. nothing ownership body. Currently least 2 states full crisis care, much reason goverment mandates vaccines, said, nobody mandated anything, always get weekly tests, quit, find job ready stick goverment get covid, thats show guess

this whole thing stupid, want avoid getting covid, illiness matter, even selfish asshole understands basic logic, getting sick sucks, covid make death attractable outcome. 

I dont think anything ownership body, listening morons parroting despite self interest, sucks you, lead nose like that, hopefully kind gullibility doesnt lead financial ruin, worse, dont check it, something shitty happen eventually.  fact, doctors give medication accordance virus, bacteria invades body, e.g. antibiotics evidence virus learning evade it. tell depend immune system instead relying antibiotics combat viruses bacterias make sick.

The convenient truth, current covid vaccine derived earliest covid variant used combat currently mutated variant’s. definitely protect earlier covid variants, say effectives current mutated variants akin saying it’s “antibiotics covid variants” prevent covid variants, sadly isn’t true doesn’t prevent getting latest variants covid cure you. sometimes even Homer Simpsons, even best people fuck despite best efforts sadly :/ Good! Frees ICUs rest us! Brids usually migrate way fall. looks like close 40% ottowans getting second dose study period (right grip hockey stick, speak). See something authors really caught time.

That said, glad see right thing retracting it, glad peer review process worked. still around 3 years...ummm sure cya then...I guess?  comment made resident Texas, yeah, confirm saw par course state. said, I’m Dallas, much different rural areas. I’ll abstain politics…. say glad sounds like rational adults making decisions New York. I’m shocked. shocked.  really, really use water instead buffer solution. Or, red bull (for whoever thought red bull would've good idea). idea would abused though, title, confuses me. lot incentives people fake positive rapid test? Fake negative one, yes see risk people get flight something. Fake positive, sent get proper full test found negative, point? day work perhaps? profoundly stupid prank? disgusting situation. they're making pay membership member! No....ivermectin chemically human use.   basically week long sex fest. rural MN attitude much beer fun 1:1 relationship. much fun determined many beers drink. guaranteed least 10-15 fun one night 24 pack Busch Lite.

Craft beers? can't much 6-7 fun those. Yes -- 

If get covid vaccinated, even symptoms, could pass children. However, vaccinated, chance getting infected first place much lower compared unvaccinated people. Tim Dillon win It’s fantastic he’s right, minus reverse psychology.

He nailed neurosis psychopathy readers perfectly missed mark “enemies.”

And yet guy never stop wonder whether perhaps people, he’s wrong side. like number people actually quitting getting fired vaccine mandates typically around 0.3% 0.9%. obviously federal mandate federal employees only..private companies decide themselves.

unless establishment open public like restaurant, state laws come play owner management Swab tests take samples nasal cavity. Vaccines help kill virus, create physical nostril barriers prevent virus particles entering hanging around nasal cavity first place. CDC voted give high risk workers, head CDC (? think) overrode side FDA. I'm pretty sure point officially approved high risk workers 65 high risk? process v confusing

California preparing boosters while, soon hit 6 months able get booster easily. See outbreak among miners Mojiang 2012: near China-Laos border).

Would mind quoting bit walked back? like say... medicine humans... instance   Okay confused institutional setting meant? know meant like school something. Thanks clarification.

Nebulizing hydrogen peroxide. they've finally reached 'disinfectants lungs' stage insanity. good points! think since drive, totally imagine working well! Nice hear nurses judging! That's issue US though.... issue state rights powerful supercede federal mandates, governers certain states fighting tooth nail discredit sort messaging coming Federal gov, CDC, FDA etc. They're literally using conspiry theories push back common sense saftey measures. Talk barleywine, drink porter. ;) I'd disagree. still people suffering think would agree hospital best chance survival. Certainly better random home remedies FB. Cases alone tell whole story.  This. I'm sommelier, people try act like know want. able that? probably

Yeah, is. say must, denied care (as many people shouting)  incredibly tragic. fuck crops video like this. I'm watching landscape video extended doubled vertical video, shown black bars sides landscape screen.

That's true coronaviruses general, narrow subgenus level, especially pronounced. Undoubtedly we'll continue find closer closer relatives continue collect samples bats animals analyzed. There's reason majority virologists favor zoonotic origin hypothesis. That's say field researcher infected attempting collect sample brought back WIV1, less likely, infected animal sample containment, bioengineering hypothesis seen increasingly less likely. cannot stand sweet wine. Yuck!  Anyone declared eligible today’s CDC release get booster today? pure insanity. need dual citizenship move Canada. live/work PR card, get lengthy immigration process.

It difficult get in-demand job. Even then, still lengthy process, high chance rejection. Oh wow! Fort Worth, right next you. Yea, think another big part everyone willing get vaccine horrific NYC last year Spring. Nobody wants repeat that. everything close quarters, pretty much guaranteed come contact Covid point.

And please think speaking bad Texas. know mostly negative controversial shit gets headlines. friend gf testament knowing people also rational getting vaccinated. Plus there's much space really feel uncomfortable going seeing people always wearing masks. actually amazing time. Everyone friendly. pulled pork best I've ever had. Can't wait go back.  This. I'm process getting fuck right now. think companies would wake fuck hybrid/remote work. People ""productive"" WFH productive office except niche roles/organizations require extreme, regular collaboration. 

I'm glad got new employer better respects work-life balance, time, health/safety employees.  first official report infection later attributed AIDS made LA. discovery virus made Paris 2 years later.

This really makes grateful advances science identify Covid within month first officially reported cases. article even say livestock form even caused deaths. agree. Maybe would've made sense March 2020 people sure deadly was. think still kind restrictions almost two years later vaccine ways treat sounds awful me. saw video people near shore whole helicopter flew tell leave they'll go jail. One times I'm thankful live America lol Oh gotcha. I'm curious link?

Although knock people stupid/irresponsible rather medication dangerous? “selfish unvaccinated selfish fucking selfish assholes”

FTFY Exposure question- walk work unmasked (I’m vaccinated there’s barely anyone streets I’m way). also let kid (too young vaccinated) stay stroller unmasked because, again, we’re outdoors aren’t tons people. 

Three days ago passed friend mom’s walking. unmasked outdoors. said hi me, spoke maybe minute, gave kid $20 candy. Today called mom tell young kid COVID (started showing symptoms today, immediately taken tested). 

Would count close contact? kid’s pediatrician won’t test without symptoms I’m hesitant take kid public testing site risk exposure it’s totally necessary. care get secret, long get it. Though, damage done continuing anti-vax rhetoric, ultimately want people get vaccination begin moving fashion pandemic. That's ambivalent means.  said actual uptick Americans leaving country renouncing citizenship. Ah, the6 think are.  really do.

Walgreens said state they’ll new guidance appointments starting Saturday say teacher also count YES do. Vaccines prevent infection entirely many cases. Yes 100% absolutely prevent infection. feel like I'm Facebook. understand that’s point publishing findings, right? Maybe bats eating humans infected COVID-19? Theoretically, got alpha variant still antibodies it, would offer protection.

It would offer ""the same"" protection, pretty close. Also, probably worth mentioning got alpha variant mean long there's source good chili you. spicy beef tomato stew, throw bunch right things together wait.  One things cook ha ha. I'm gonna google ""Gose"" keep eyes open that! even insurance before, really. many folks still unemployed US. defend FDA CDC, honestly wtf going them, hospitals ICUs filling immediate concern impacts everyone, vaccinated not. already seeing increase preventable deaths simply wait times get care high available resources low.

Brought Carl’s Jr. Yes money matters course. Good question. schools opened without requiring masks however quickly fell wayside. Something like 90% students state K-12 mask mandate probably least partially factor.

Naturally schools looking numbers immediately switching back mask optional boneheaded. Ugh, why? They've undeniably respond covid related calls recently, take jab safer? I'm huge wook, like crystal collection bag always, got vaccine. I'm walking image anti vaxxer none rhetoric.

* people 65 years older residents long-term care settings **should** receive booster shot Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine least 6 months Pfizer-BioNTech primary series

* people aged 50–64 years underlying medical conditions **should** receive booster shot Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine least 6 months Pfizer-BioNTech primary series,

* people aged 18-64 years increased risk COVID-19 exposure transmission occupational institutional setting **may** receive booster shot Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine least 6 months Pfizer-BioNTech primary series, based individual benefits risks.

The listed medical conditions cover HUGE swath population cover everyone. particular overweight/obese covers large percentage adults. Add front-line workers risk due jobs huge majority. doesn’t transmit outside Mr Scientist idea reduce transmission. Everything list that. WA too. expected whole west coast top ten least. Nothing data suggests would anywhere near efficiently adult vaccines, mask mandates, restaurant closure, NPIs. Countries/states stuck &lt;60% adult vaccine coverages can't bothered NPIs expect future waves, accompanying death. said, child vaccines nice, focus stuff works necessary.  No. rules basically feel need booster, you’re 18, vaccinated Pfizer, get one. Seriously. That’s comes to, wide swath listed. really think people going take pill wont even take shot?

There's ""grassroots"" (more like astro-turf we're honest) marketing campaign vaccines going DECADES, that's reason people hesitant vaccines. So, yes, do.

I'm graduate student fully vaccinated campus send us weekly COVID update week. note, campus wide positivity rate 1% every single week since semester started typically 75-85% lower broader citywide positivity rate. Hoping preview broader society might look like protection approaches 100% either vaccination prior infection coming months. Shutting outdoor restaurants, parks, mandating healthy people stay inside, recommending outdoor masks, mandating masks allowing people remove sit down. Mandating 2 year olds wear masks statistically young people unaffected. Please explain science I’m college educated can’t understand reasoning behind body produces antibodies. MRNA vaccines triggers body produce correct antibodies fight virus.  so. I'm currently recovering covid (still coughing week half), passed 1-4 people despite best efforts. vaccinated last April. whole ""contagious 2 days prior symptoms"" real kicker. feel fine, really concerned. could go see neurologist maybe get MRI sure. thoughts too. question is, lessened case still lead long term issues sure think ""bear"" hairy gay men called, maybe something like that.

Or like shark week bears.. Covid killed police officers line duty death 2020 looks repeat 2021. lot people downvoting you, places comparable vaccination rates reopened, things went south within months. 

Guess watch hope best consider canary coal mine.

If approve booster Moderna couple weeks now, different 3rd shot currently authorized immunocompromised 1st two; half dose, 50ug instead 100. asking why, alone. ever tested 50. India high incidence parasittosis could argued ivermectin lessen load immune system getting rid parasites. 
And besides, India wonderful country, hardly famous excellent health care system.

I don’t think skirt rules terms obtaining booster means hospital tracking vaccines pretty seriously imagine awkward show 2 months (or whenever) booster shot ask already one. What's bear week? Oh dear.. hope things work okay her. Best wishes. Probably within day two most, later today. worry, BC anti-vaxxers indication, think best way protest vaccine mandates block hospitals, harass businesses, terrify elementary school children.  Also possible immune system didn’t kick much first 2 doses due immune suppressing meds take. So, Covid anymore? guess that's win... guess no, barring significant deterioration protection death. easily 80% population protection via either vaccination prior infection, even higher rate vulnerable populations.  Pretty much anyone got Pfizer.... hear anti vaxxer turn TV internet real life walk away nut jobs.

Do engage. ""passports"" introduced useless. 

He's making optional businesses decided whether implement them. supposed see 60% reduction capacity (but lots businesses ignoring rules anyway). He's basically putting onus businesses decide whether vaccine restrictions government look like bad guy.

Which means anti-vaccine businesses get anti-vaccine vector hubs congregate make worse. 

Of course businesses implement passport getting death threats naturally...

Fortunately, Calgary already decided make mandatory hope Edmonton follows suit.  announcement terribly worded unfortunately confused hell people subject  Norway 90% 18+ 1. dose, expected weeks 90% 2. dose. No. 5 months pain IM injection normal. See doctor.  Missing point? person replying indicated Individual isn’t crippling debt going hospital individual Norwegian catches covid lands hospital it’s biggie anyone.

Not true. Norwegian tax payer hook people’s stupid decisions take risks vaccinated. straight treatment covid like would basically eliminate need vaccine could pull off. can't kill cause long term damage take pill dies out. *2 New Mexicans..*

That's awful. Glad tell getting better! No, mandates answer but, go long way protect vulnerable populace. Despite ignore mandate, benefits still exponential.
I agree healthcare prioritized done part protect others getting vaccinated. could agree more- truly following science today. respect it. I’m sure people aren’t widely seeing that. Zookeeper vaccinated. hope sad story helps make happen.  Let bears pay bear tax, pay Homer tax. whole heartedly agree. people sudden “finding” religion late that’s real bullshit.  I’d interested seeing results culturing samples. PCR detects viral RNA, doesn’t know anything RNA came from. using PCR proxy viral load researchers assuming viral RNA came infectious whole virus. 

But vaccinated people mount strong early attack virus unvaccinated can’t, it’s reasonable consider vaxed large portion PCR-detected viral RNA might come deactivated virus viral fragments compared unvaccinated. One recently submitted study that’s pre-print comparison viral cultures found exactly that. points possibility peak *infectious* viral load, addition shorter-lived vaxed, also lower vaxed unvaxed.  drinking inherently endanger anyone actions endanger others illegal. sit next six beers, jeopardizing health safety way. chose drive home that, would breaking law would go jail caught. why? endangers others that, right it. whether people regardless. totally irrelevant.

There breakthroughs, generally things works. work quite well. think problem layers control like mask given due noncooperation. doesn’t make claim less true though…. question is, vaccinated people spread virus? answer yes. 

“But it’s symptomatic people!”
- well there’s also studies showing truly asymptomatic cases aren’t spreading virus, regardless vaccination status. 

“But viral load decreases much faster vaccinated”
- viral load *mild* cases diminish rather quickly day two symptom onset. 

There’s lot ways read data. end day doesn’t make comment less true. Yeah, why? Better phrasing ""it reduces eliminate transmission"" saying ""doesn't prevent transmission"" entire truth kind statement antivaxxers run with. easy imagine multiple levels coverup (original bumblers try fails cover oops, management discovers tries minimize hide; repeat can't hidden more..) friend day 9 Delta Flu. pain meds home.

It's brutal knowing protected dying nine year old home.  nonsense unrealistic goal, they've explained TWiV virological principles. dismiss explanation? like people heard TWiV actual arguments. time made act public interest. pandemic really making hidden crazies stand out. understand misinformation point, stupidity. much ""study"" led never published. longer need quarantine exposed.  you, Ron? Preprint studies really fucked lot ""science"" since beginning.  stupid.

Vaccinated people likely spread virus become infected.

Why call everything is? need twist truth?    Unfortunately, yes. seem large portions country determined drag pandemic long possible. get spoiled fast. forgotten feeling vaccine, knowing we'll ever one works, knowing thing definitely coming everyone eventually natural origin lab escape theory makes least sense me. 

But happened - Marburg virus (a relative Ebola, first filiovirus discovered) infected lab workers multiple labs Europe handling monkeys sourced Africa happened infected.  deadly, fortunately contagious.  Oh put caps understand completely.  truth Australia handled COVID-19 extremely well. country rank 172nd world cases per capita 174th world deaths per capita. vaccine rollout bit rocky first, like countries, appears going well. Talk porter, drink IPA? :) ""For me, got best nothing Yes teacher claiming know several colleagues nontrivial symptoms due vaccine wearing 6 months. contradicts CDC web page, well TWiV would suggest infections vaccinated people nontrivial due decline protection 8 months. subtle misunderstanding exactly waning story also unsubstantiated. Unless saying Racaniello would agree teacher fully vaccinated people getting sick multiple weeks 8 months later vaccine decline: would call b.s. correlation stupidity pure evil. Although would consider anti-vaxxer evil too. correlation evil stupid pure evil. CDC still recommending 6 months 2nd dose people qualify booster, even high risk, correct? Healthy Teachers/school staff pfizer - guys getting booster?  Long covid symptoms symptom underlying damage. there's less symptoms, there's likely less damage. mean damage done types damage equally prevented, least provide evidence protection. Better studies always welcome, probably best available study vaccine effectiveness types post-infection effects. wine: “talk dry, drink sweet.” Good status doesnt mean good science

Science celebrity That's tried meant, actually... lol  Oregon could never hold authority stop kissing homies goodnight point pandemic. least Cuomo gone won’t able kill another several thousand elderly folks. way worse flu. April. sucked. Two weeks hell, lost job come back 2 weeks gave me.

Stay home, wear masks, hand sanitize. funnily (or sadly) enough circles I've found strong direct correlation anti-vax anti-security belt opinions.  natural immunity stronger immunity derived vaccine? seatbelt analogy really work. Among unvaccinated, virus travels unhindered highway multiple off-ramps refueling stations. vaccinated, gets lost maze dead-end streets cul-de-sacs. Every often, pieces together escape route, scenarios, finds cut off, journey ends. go further.

For rare escape route scenario, often think Houston outdoors tent wedding required vaccination attendees got really unlucky one bringing Delta variant India--several getting infected, one death. Circumstances would much worse without precautions vaccination requirement, goes show unlucky escape route there.
  Maybe laziness horse ivermectin products ""over counter"" solution people.

One alternative would sell reasonably-priced counter ivermectin pharmacies, limited quantities per customer curb risk overdose. advertise ""COVID-19 medicine"", though.   Low state travel combined extremely rural population basically serve defacto social distancing. Leading slower spread.  Sometimes even wearing seatbelt doesn’t make immune injury car crash, dammit it! save life! That’s made law wear it. It’s make uncomfortable driving, it’s save you! (It’s would say people.

He's part discussions CDC epidemiologists countries, Israel. 

Finally, he's vaccinated staff well. wearing masks hallways? Yes are. tells everything need know.  Exactly. really anything specific ivermectin. could overdose many medications.

Do take much medication. Pretty simple, really. Probability really hard thing grasp people, visible throughout pandemic. Masks work / work, vaccines work / work, lockdowns work / work.. anybody know much ivermectin much much guys took accumulates time system creates toxicity? one said wasn’t hypocrite. Jesus Christ person stupid… really hope troll. entirely different shot tell you: turns around quick. like actually sick there's recovery period. got shot Tuesday, felt like pile shit night Wednesday, woke Thursday like nothing ever happened.

Yes do. Used work hospital administration. Pretty much Filipinos accounting, coding, filing, insurance paperwork on. entire system, patient facing administrative, would implode without hard work stopped suddenly en masse. Vaccines accepted normal vast majority population. rich country, generation ago even poorer access health care luxury many, vaccines became national plan 1970's normal want access something before. Adults kids started vaccinated many diseases kids parents know important vaccinated. always oppose vaccines, irrelevant minority senses expression irrelevant.
As vaccination process, politics part process. military structure organized process perfect. something military know well organize logistic distribution structure. wait politicians burocracts literally screwed. Yeah, times health officials lost completely touch reality. Like suggesting [sex 

Worse, confuse people. cannot recommend thousands rules want follow important ones. read article? 🤔 Ok. That's fair good, also well known me, vaccinated person still easily carrier spreader virus.

Moreover, vaccinated person likely spread unknowingly, i'm much less likely symptoms unvaxxed people could easily choose stay home feel unwell.

So, taken account, anything, mean vaccinated person could actually spreading wider (uknowingly course) compared unvaccinated?

Add unvaxxinated mostly cut life parts world, vaccinated life continues normal, there's way events contacts would (unknowingly) spread virus.

Or logic faulty here? so, i'd like understand why. I'm trying raise argument nothing, i'm genuinely trying understand. first shot I'm nervous second 🥲 joke. I'm trying trust science  5% mortality rate cause country break down. people take seriously. Cause bad enough warrant total panic.

Well enlightening. Today learned 100% people natural immunity, natural immunity, therefore natural immunity *not* better. /s Saying may natural immunity following COVID infection different saying natural immunity ineffective.

Additionally, understanding humans multiple forms immune memory antibodies one them, actually dishonest misleading even bullet point? insinuates antibodies sole vanguard lasting immunity, factually untrue? Correct I'm immunity fades faster vaccine immunity

[6-8 months faster we're administering boosters immunity alone less half effective natural immunity plus vaccination

Interesting, underlying conditions cause individuals likely become *infected* COVID-19? understanding underlying conditions driver serious illness death *when* infected, I've never heard conditions compromised immune systems predictor actual infection.

Today’s committee pretty clear needed make decision basis available data benefits (in preventing hospitalization) vs risks boosters. According committee data strong 65+ would get benefit outweighs risks boosters. large scale data isn’t yet booster benefits younger 65 even including underlying health conditions high exposure occupations.

They decide allow boosters 65 underlying health conditions individual basis due concerns anecdotal reports hospitalizations group.

From listening meeting clear committee members focused primary goal reducing hospitalizations intent following science. Unfortunately science isn’t yet 65 would allow blanket recommendations.

They also made clear isn’t final word revised recommendations coming near future additional data received. FDA approved occupational age 65+ think thats miscommunication started, read full article FYI.

No. separate terms describing separate things fall common umbrella immunization.

I'm fully vaccinated, mid-20s work requiring get covid test. Anyone experience cold symptoms ended covid? think pretty low probability I'm extreme anxiety it. seems CDC/FDA concerned hospitalizations.

That make sense though. hospitals jammed, can't afford lose workers. ....but problem anymore 

so offending .......  Anyone know full authorization might come 12-15 year old group? Exactly. sad stated.

Like works lmao. freedoms Impeed others isnt freedom  Carbon emissions factories endangers everyone's lives. makes profits rich, exempt. inviting me? Cause there. 😎  Yeah, makes perfect sense me. combat gun violence arbitrarily take away civil liberties lawful firearm owners. virus deadly people stupid, virus deadly 👍 Thought available allowing rapid kits US? realise 90% eligible adults. Canada 80% vaccinated total eligible population ages 12 up.   think votes confusion feel need get vaccinated. saying ""too much good thing"" applies even vaccines.  Yeah sadly still 200+ deaths day here. numbers jump around quite bit. Hopefully dust settles bit things round becomes, expert said today, bit like common cold. far away point mystery though. course throw them, case one mad man wanted punch someone disgusting me.  theory people suffer depression struggle get get bed pandemic offered less pressure leave house live exciting lives. People able work home. less expectations birthday parties holiday obligations. Facebook feed wasn’t full people posting exotic vacations crazy nights friends. Everyone home watching Netflix etc. think people probably likely attempt succeed found relief this. extroverts probably suffered largest change psychological distress. thought too. stop vaccinations? that’s takes crazies get want, hold hats. 2 examples make happy stuck card labels came vials (with name batch numbers them). Except number cases it’s occurred far, far less number due COVID. article day, CDC analysis showed much beneficial give booster dose people 65 older people younger age groups

Risk myocarditis younger patients doubles (still small) move needle much, reason thats given China still rectal tests foreigners? great reasons get vaxxed, subject *that* clinch it.  Yeah,this 12th time I've heard it. Basically government punishing people supposed (in getting vaccinated).

There LOT people fall outside guidelines risk. hope wasn’t political pressure give boosters rest world caught up. assumption previous COVID gives one natural immunity.

And place list even comes close prison. sure he's Canadian? sounds un-Canadian. Seems like critically assess either...

Why hostile rude? can't civil? kill you.   Seriously, think alot coworkers (RNs) vaccinated going hold onto last minute required mandate. Like why, narcissist defiant asshole? work vulnerable sick patients. That, they're let go. affects rest us, since know nurses always already overworked understaffed. Well least worms. Yes, think was. Agreed also comment breakthrough cases. teacher, testing every week feel safe kids. Daycare preschool teachers even longer go kids vaccinated.  You’re completely unable unwilling explain *Jacobson* upheld 100+ years somehow cannot apply particular mandate. It’s kinda almost like maybe jumped convo argument you’re prepared defend. 

I cannot help further. people thought sinus infection actually Covid. you’re daily life around people get tested. Hmm, maybe also herpies parties Alberta? 80% better would well way like June July past summer. no. can’t nice things!😂 It’s 18 plus certain conditions also misrepresenting 10th ammendment. federal government makes law something means longer power reserved states. 10th mean powers granted fed constitution granted states, also includes laws passed.  agree. It’s going take breakthrough examples (someone vaccine, wanted booster, couldn’t rules) hammer going come criticizing govt.  Cool backwoods science got going there.  shocking. hope revisit issue occupational risk future meetings. now, really sucks. Pfizer available first, many people healthcare got vaccine. Healthcare workers (and childcare/educ, lots careers) positions possibly unknowingly infect many others. everyone infected and/or vaccinated, every new case ""breakthrough"" case, danger drops (probably) somewhere cold flu. 


If cases asymptomatic almost one put back hospital we're set...mostly. There's lot dying then, though. Octo-pi measles vaccine prevent transmission?   First time Court opinion start ""and can't believe say this..."" mean everyone 49 states? Anything nothing? 

I'm past ready FEDERAL vax mandate would settle mask mandate starters. live stores schools requiring absolute height Delta surge people dropping like flies result. There's free ICU bed anywhere. Leaving individual establishments pointless. Lawmakers need make laws based science, feelings ""what's good business"". Sorry but... predictions month two pandemic always hit miss. Let alone year. see belligerent stupidity face. Still, kick bed. Irresponsible headline, mention kidney transplant. guy, developed vaccine virus, idea he's talking someone else made prediction wrong last year? know still harping hydroxychloroquine. Ok, thoughts prisoners allowed vote then? dont right participate society based actions Every time there's measles outbreak recent years (thank Wakefield) they'd report 90+% victims unvaccinated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* so?  law illegal oxymoron. that's said. ""The mandate illegal."" said unconstitutional would corrected you. encourage read majority opinions case, since clear not. 14th ammendment question. tell look elementary constitutional concept like federalism bastardizing meaning ""state police power"" context. 

Read case attempt understand opinions justices come spouting complete utter nonsense. ‘Kids 12’ different ‘kids 12 older’.  Since lot stores anti-vax pro-vax areas, I'm guessing, like big companies, they're keeping head down. Luckily almost stores franchises, there's easy out: leave decision store owner/operator.  want get fat. Go fillipino party. Leftover weeks   it’s annotated someone, it’ll end medical record point. work healthcare. something done Walgreens primary knew despite different systems. Well, police may waste resources tracking husbands every woman recently vaccinated instead actually making progress towards finding him. False equivalence. know it. And? Doesnt matter new. still tyrannical  one unified American attitude. ridiculous political divide, even things like health science politicized. people willing listen politicians doctor comes healthcare. 

There American's listening healthcare providers experts science listening politicians. 

The craziest part complete insanity conspiracy theorists believe everything read social media forums.

I saw headline Onion, politician suggesting going start putting vaccine salad dressing make sure people get it.

I expect shitshow continue least six months, I'll assess point. see great place then.  Herd immunity work now. Delta transmissible get quite breakthrough cases. UK we're levelling 30/35k cases day mo. Looks like might stay way time being. entire first episode Mad Men main ad guy struggling find ways market cigarettes Yeah, are. Doubt. Maybe rich countries. world’s poorer countries aren’t vaccinated all. **this specific** pandemic over.

FTFY sure goes I've heard rumours people getting fake cards cause want shot.. cases paying fake cards too.. like shot free helping everyone too.. understandable child want get vaccines. *not* understandable parent want get child vaccines want deal little bit crying/complaining/whatever.

Children cry complain time every time get way. Unless suggesting also ""understandable"" parents let kids whatever want, no, understandable either. Uhhh yea haha misinformation backfired brainwashes population. 

I many Russian friends great told country mad.  I'm curious see happens well...it's wild card looks like cases going up...  kinda like tried coke first time. liked much think modeling US. think got 3 big waves left everyone gets it, gets vax. Guess one easier? Meanwhile, CT, took one morons they're fucking beds treatments available.  law can't illegal.

A law absolutely executive order holds weight law

Holds weight, sure. scope power different. Executive power much narrow overridden congressional legislation.

Ever heard Supreme Jacobson case question constitutionality vaccine mandate.

Yes specific that. question whether local vaccine mandate reasonable exercise state police fact state law question federal law makes difference regard constitutionality it.

That blatantly wrong. Constitution delegates specific powers federal government, powers reserved state governments Tenth Amendment. Look ""federalism"" think quote says CDC afraid unvaccinated people cant figure *how* get vaccine.  
I think saying , essentially, worried boosters end going people know work system (e.g., politicians, people experience working healthcare bureaucracy, rich people category 2 person payroll handle things) rather people genuinely need most. agree different things. 

But idiots also understand vaccines exist time. they'd available, Washington would definitely required them, variolation carried single digit death rate. (6-9% iirc)

Point government required immunity. done hard way, lol.  watching CBS evening news put graphic saying pregnant women Ah yes, [parody becomes That's thing anti-vaxxers make sense. Usually someone know adverse reaction vaccine. mean make anti-vaxxer identity start evangelizing it. Quite opposite. Since can't get vaccinated, pro-vax rely everyone else vaccinated protection.  current study, authors collected umbilical cord blood samples 36 newborns time delivery. obtained samples analyzed anti-S IgG. 36 mothers, 35 received doses either mRNA vaccines pregnancy. one received single dose. median interval completion vaccination course delivery 13 weeks. 
It found 36 infants (100 percent) protective antibodies birth. possessed high degrees anti-S IgG. 34 neonates titer values u/mL two 249 u/mL 201 u/mL, respectively. 
The mothers newborns blood titers 250 u/mL. Also, neonate whose mother received one dose vaccine still high titer value u/mL.

This may small study 100% babies covid antibodies. still good news. FL 3K away passing NY. 37yo coworker got breakthrough case. Got Pfizer early year.

Moderate symptoms flu/sinus infection. Nevada got changed red status covid military. Florida right now. I’m doubting way vaccines work. seen studies showing amount viral discharge upper respiratory tract infected people without vaccine.

I looking tangible studies show case (looking positives) put mind ease. courts said except accidental discharge. weapon returned owner. Therefore, lawful firearm owner. 

You see, vast majority mass-killings US carried [legal firearm legal commit heinous act. That's firearms control important. wild totally collapsed healthcare system still put place mandates. never realised physically impossible forget gun loaded!

Gun **always loaded** even aren't. Everybody knows natural way carry unbroken gun barrel butt. finger trigger certain could paying attention.

Just gun always loaded, going accidentally forget fingers relationship trigger. something anyone holding gun forgets. thing applies gun pointed, nobody carries gun forgets keep pointed safe direction.  understand claim high numbers even able deliver doses outside clinical trials, promising results. People absolutely that. they'll get better, get antibodies t-cells. Slightly less protection vaccine shot, still protection spreading around shortly afterwards. protection wane months (just like vaccines) rinse repeat. 

The one thing thats missing argument acknowledgement people getting covid regardless whether they've vaccinated not. DNR

Thankfully entire state Idaho DNR! got one covered.    much CDC wrong, misleading taken context. CDC report talking spreading get breakthrough case. left fact much harder someone vaccinated get point first place. Conservatives conveniently leave part try spread bullshit. 'm tired us coddling militantly ignorant

They're ignorant, they're often prideful.

I'm sure bad people definitely are. Better yet, let show us much trust fucking superior immune system, locking goddamned Covid ward couple days. 

Solve whole bunch problems. Seems like Denmark Norway decided fully reopening around 70% fully vaccinated - _entire_ population, 12 though.

Been going well Denmark.  ask it. able tell test like that. saying case counts drop vaccination rates increase? shown false due COVID vaccines preventing transmission? mandated vaccines too. I'm annoyed alma mater that.  Would helpful linked one said go mate. already knew them. I’m expecting people go digging for
me, happen one hand…

Instead insulting. sayin.  Facebook Ivermectin worshipers going say now? India go-to example statement: ""Look India, they're using Ivermectin."" harm vaccine cause?

This article says protection previous COVID infection wanes time, like got   would agree consistent would, provided developed using cells electively murdered children.  I'm young health problems, vaccinated 6 months ago work pest control, I'm close contact at-risk people, people care virus. wear respirator surgical mask tucked inside, much. I've calling every pharmacy around morning see get booster, either clueless CDC/ FDAs recommendation, company updated policy yet. much longer till pharmacies update policy follow CDC/ FDA ? businesses making ventilators hospital gowns. Lots smart business men getting rich covid. Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol  Oke give   Tourists cause trouble deported banned returning. dumb even pandemic Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol Aight aight  Make sure will, DNR, stay eff home. Yup. chicken pox kid, ended shingles 30's.  Cute nurse! 3rd shot yesterday Norway - 3rd shots approved for
Immune compromised people immune suppressing medication.

My first 2 shots Pfizer #1 shot put bed day. #2 made arm really sore besides slight chills hour, hardly noticeable.

My 3rd shot yesterday Moderna hit like truck today. Headache, sore neck, body aches, weakness, runny nose, cough. kind useless day. seems getting little better evening approaches expect wife needs walk dog tonight. prudent idea. Regular workers signed up, equipped trained enforce law upon customers. Dedicated security needs hired purpose. I'm arguing people claim take pills dont need vaccinated. 

Doctors reccomend want. abused. 

I'm looking society whole, medical side.   I’ve seen enough tv know half fired ones would become arsonists scores settle half would become vigilantes over-inflated sense righteousness. FBI BAU Brooklyn 99 CSI would hunt down. headline garbage. wife Pfizer booster last week. really sick second shot, booster got sick hours next day. symptoms.... body ache, chills, etc took nap fine after.

My second shot rough still scheduled weekend case.  See... picture alone already bias.

But go ahead downvote me, least confirms coming implosion.  You’re deflecting original question. don’t know that’s fine, don’t condescending someone asking question. That’s rude ruins sort conversation. Name calling makes extra pursuasive. Arguing anti-vaxxers like arguing flat earthers, worth time  was, whole comment cause second third order effects ultimately reduce amount vaccinated people. 

This plays anti vaxxer argument healthcare system wanting make money actually curing anything.

You argument slice mine I'm taking systems thinking approach. narrow minded. knowingly, turn free vaccine world dying get, sympathy think denied emergency care. I'm tired us coddling militantly ignorant. That's Donald Trump said, may lead us 2024! Sigh. original comment replied stated incorrectly 1 1000 changed 1 100,000. Thus quip ""only 2 zeros missing"" Almost experts think that. millions millions people around world do. wife told KFOR unvaccinated people refuse wear masks put people like Ted jeopardy. She’s hoping story help change hearts minds.

Unfortunately won’t… hopefully recovers! total edgelord [fuck Mother  Norway pretty low income taxes actually. live wealthy life average job. There’s one thing agree antivax folks about, that’s CDC dropped ball ball messaging, hurt credibility.  isn’t true. Biden administration actively redistributed vaccines donated well
More 80 million vaccine goal (an extra 30 million) cause states weren’t using vaccines. Yes, earmarked vaccines specifically donations, administration tagged even due lack usage. Vaccines prevent transmission, without preventing 100% transmission. Vaccines provide protection virus without complete forcefield. Antivax types zero terms act like big scandal breakthrough cases. whole point provide people excuses get vaccinated operate society. Putting larger populace risk. 

If proven halt progression disease, decrease amount time contagious, people acquiring natural resistance via antibodies cells afterwards- i'm seeing play much positively are. 

You're essentially arguing therapeutics now- regenron ecmo- vaccine exists, people instead rely therapeutics. Disregarding much therapeutics help people suffering. Doctors recommend people both.

As therapeutics come out, increasingly mimics flu. elderly vulnerable, shots available you, fully protect infection. pill tamiflu part covid.

I agree you. Pfizer's making well, coming regardless.  Norway almost normal months. Life mask-free pretty much everything. Tomorrow life less 2019 again. nearly unanimous since first generation Reformation.  Imma keep getting voted curiosity way high people safety tests. 🙃 aluminum diet 1-2 %of aluminum actually absorbed body.


To quote article 


Use highly pure antigens improve vaccine safety led reduced vaccine immunogenicity efficacy. led need use adjuvants improve vaccine immunogenicity. ideal adjuvant maximize vaccine immunogenicity without compromising tolerability safety. Unfortunately, adjuvant research lagged behind vaccine areas antigen discovery, consequence limited number adjuvants based aluminium salts, monophosphoryl lipid A oil emulsions currently approved human use. Recent strategic initiatives support adjuvant development National Institutes Health translate greater adjuvant choices future. Mechanistic studies valuable better understanding adjuvant action, mechanisms adjuvant toxicity less well understood. inflammatory danger-signal model adjuvant action implies increased vaccine reactogenicity inevitable price improved uhhh lmao. ppl realize “loved one” won’t even make car ride home, right? let alone icu doors. christ, stupidity astounding. it’s like dunning kruger x 1 million. 

ppl really underestimate panic inducing someone die right front them, even death expected (longtime hospice nurse, here). they’d prob shit pants beg staff hook back within 2 mins caretake. umm sure. put lines tubes like we’re plugging christmas lights - hurry. god 😑 wish footage uncensored real covid icu care making general public. really zero idea. I'm risk, live someone risk, seem like get booster safe? Freaks out. recently came RSV whole family caught put dad hospital. Can't imagine covid would vaccinated.  fully expect surge, like flu surge risk groups close 100% fully vaccinated. Norway risk free, going zero covid, going back normal, regular risk life starting tomorrow. No. vaccine shots, soreness lasted less second shot first. Yeah, definitely true. Delta variant shorter ""incubation"" period...I'm guessing effective multiplication rate higher due entering cells higher rate. So, sort trade duration virus spread lethal is. far (with Delta least) evolution seems favor virus version infect cells quickly.   Yeah, high viral load, actually *have* covid (whether symptomatic not), lot less likely get vaccinated. I'm talking people refuse vaccine; even read comment? think everyone get vaccinated, I’m seeing anything shows vaccine effective getting infected delta variant.

It certainly prevents severe infection, continuing claim vaccine blocks infection isn’t helping. Anybody see that’s true leads people mistrusting vaccine general. I’m old don’t fully understand. someone knowledgeable please explain me:

I vaccinated. kids not. go store somehow get infected asymptomatic, still pass children? still difficult IMG get US residency. 

You taking huge gamble go Caribbean Med School expect get US Canadian Residency. Yeah. I'm trying get one today, one gotten updated guidelines yet, wait.  everything I've read, seems like big reason Delta variant problematic replicates fast. breath in, starts replicate quickly. think also read there's data live places body, like replicate sinuses, deep lungs (although can't find source now), start replicating sooner potentially smaller exposure?

But vaccinated, immune system primed respond, reacts quickly. earlier variants, immune system would almost always respond faster virus could replicate, snuff developing symptoms high enough viral load spread it. Delta, seems like people's immune systems still react fast enough either get rid right away, least ""catch up"" start fighting symptoms get serious.

But still means Delta gets going period replicating faster body destroying it, infectious. Hopefully, also symptoms period. seems like still possible vaccinated people Delta replicating creating high viral load spreadable symptoms show up. 

Of course unvaccinated person serious trouble. Without vaccine bodies struggled react fast enough earlier variants avoid serious symptoms, Delta much easier catch/transmit, possibly seems replicate quickly, even small exposure enough get ""toe hold"".  “vaccines work, sort of

It would lie say 100% effective, would quickly called lie BS Mountain pundits. ethical statements ones reveal scientifically provable rates efficacy. 

Unfortunately BS Mountain traffics nothing fallacies day long. one person got break infection, reaction, actually dies, say ""vaccines work"". Using logic, essentially nothing works, airbags, seatbelts, literally FDA approved medication things work 100% time 100% people, 100% circumstances. probably religious. mean know religious people opposed fetal cell research, got j&amp;j ......yeah. teacher. Monday six months since second dose. see four hundred unvaccinated kids week-100 plus day. scheduled appointment Sunday cvs, saying I'm immunocompromised point, fuck it. We've cases every week since school opened August kids mandatory mask, building. impossible get sub adults go covid, happened three times. Covid shot Sunday, flu shot next week. underestimate power Cleveland Clinic much complicated broad, institutional failure Exactly. Heck many hospitals putting fairly straight-forward surgeries ""elective"" person survive without -- even means immobile, pain, potentially poorer prognosis due delay.

I'm sick tired people suffering vaccine ""personal choice"". damn personal choice. Politicians balls right thing mandate it. Yes, we’re looking forward guidance boosters pregnant women point. one never heard anyone around say anything negative pope, live protestant area, feel like saying ""Most X think Y"" big generalization challenging capture nuance details headline (which generally written editor, original author). problematic vast majority see headline like reddit twitter feeds without actually reading story, cite debating. that's pretty terrible Anti-vaxxers considered domestic terrorist group Patriot Act applied them. published

do mean leaked slides NYT Friday, iirc? let people run wild weekend, communicated next week, conclusions torn shreds

CDC god-awful practically anything whole pandemic Threatening medical staff prosecuted Feds. Hell, let them. make special prison let die way want. hospital employee would presume would assuming they're condition still make medical decisions themselves. they're incapacitated covid would presume someone making medical proxy decisions them. CDC said safe ton research trials, weeks ago said 100% safe used it’s “emergency ordinance” phase. taken liability (at least Moderna vaccine).

And don’t see spread disease comparable pollution.   general population, normal see change gray matter volume thickness time people age, changes larger normal infected COVID-19. 
Interestingly, researchers separated individuals severe enough illness require hospitalization, results experienced milder COVID-19. is, people infected COVID-19 showed loss brain volume even disease severe enough require hospitalization. 
Finally, researchers also investigated changes performance cognitive tasks found contracted COVID-19 slower processing information, relative not.

You right though, fingers crossed Ontario’s data today (where virtually every case delta ages). info available daily r/Ontario:

The vaccinated, less chance mutations. Less mutations, less spread means less cases.

The vaccine literally best option get Covid. Every “side effect” bs prominent sore arm fever. 

Just get shot, it’s free works. answer questions some, note expert know research. I'm fully vaxxed teacher breakthrough infection. may caught asymptomatic student, also know close contact unmasked, asymptomatic, fully vaccinated colleague breakthrough infection couple days did. definitely believe possible fully vaccinated people spread it.

That said, nobody immediate family came COVID did, also close contact infected asymptomatic. know families caught without vaccines (mostly, exclusively, vaccines available) EVERYONE household caught it. also believe vaccinated people, even breakthrough infections, less likely spread COVID unvaccinated people. Kenny thought EOT ""Best Summer Ever"" BFFs. Turns summerboy got ghosted school started again. Things like patently absurd refuse take account asymptomatic, mild, moderate infections boosters. know long covid symptoms, vaccines halve, eliminate, risk, suggests there's still potentially serious damage breakthroughs.

And guess long lasts 'a while' brain particularly great healing itself, mostly sometimes adapt areas cover functions lost destroyed cells. people even get groceries rural areas? seems able go work, groceries, go pharmacy vet ivermectin, soon vaccine still unvaccinated make sound like need 2 extra horses cariage buy supplies winter returning home 3 days long trip back home. believe specific individual towns might hard, point infrastructure explains share unvaccinated due havong access. Exactly. Vaccines help body kill invaders. tf would I, healthy person, spread it? mean opens whole host issues. Browns game, might consider wearing bag head rather mask. Browns fans years.

We're already assuming gun owners stupid enough stow going accidentally forget fingers relationship trigger

Yes can. I've done before, though gun broken. moving arm finger instinctively went thing applies gun pointed, nobody carries gun forgets keep pointed safe direction.

Now reuse earlier trope, gun ever pointed safe direction. 

But ignoring that, people wave guns around time, especially chatting walking tough terrain. stumble fall, gun could pointed anywhere weird way, support this. Unvaccinated people denied medical treatment unless get shot. today. dealing novel virus (novel humans, least), takes time discover short long term sequelae. view, alone warrants caution reason avoid COVID parties. fahrbot, thier magra-farhbot! Masks haven’t used Norway since spring. right. hospital crowded, regions say go actual people want help get vaccines provide best protection infection

This technically true, natural immunity order magnitude better preventing infection. lab situations everyone perfectly wearing high quality mask. Real world study Bangladesh shows little effect cloth masking. look font.  Folks, I'm done assholes. I'm worn slick stupidity smugness assclowns. faith humanity taken tremendous toll past 5 years, past year worst.

[How I'm feeling idiots article right could care less anti-vaxxers think, pure evil. forcibly vaccinated denied medical care are. stupid. Masks cost pennies save Norway billions potentially using winter season. get third Moderna?

Nobody said natural immunity lesser. obvious meant - natural responses fully protect best, clinical data shows covid vaccines produce much better response. feel like know that, though. avoided completely know wrong.

It must exhausting you. Current US public health messaging: catching COVID bad wear mask avoid catching COVID (which reduces chances catching couple percent best).

FDA CDC utterly incompetent fucking up, wrong.

A mask reduces chance catching vaxxed still go without masks spread variations whatever mutating inside them? Asking seriously. virus already endemic strains far far likely develop developing countries spread US. bogus argument.  Yeah tracks.

500 NZ pop equals 33,000 US population. Given CDC data flu here: average deaths US 2010-2020 35,000—so right line NZ apparently Singapore. Walensky needs overrule useless ACIP. People need now. winter initial vaccine authorizations happened within day. don’t think that’s required, I’d imagine pretty quickly. So...being anti-vax/anti-mask accelerated evolution action... hope not. seems like really crappy thing state. I’m wondering timeline here. FDA CDC meetings week, surely she’d sign quirkily, right? 

I hope changes it. family full healthcare workers. Tell anti-maskers too. Fucking assholes, them. [Q&amp;A. good info. it’s bad even scientist can’t agree anymore studies contradict Yah, four circulating cv’s (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU) people don’t flus usually call “cold hell.” Odds better-than-not you’ve least one know call (although also flu felt like too.)

The spike protein still point effective immune response though, 50-some versions vaccines still work well… least compared world full people who’d never ever encountered version (or other) SARS before. 

The problem isn’t much vaccines don’t work survivors’ wild type antibodies aren’t good enough; it’s *novel* virus didn’t vaccine people didn’t take seriously enough avoid transmitting and/or get vaccinated soon available. become sentient, future generations virus hold symposia “Conquering Populations Robust Vaccinology Vaccine Hesitation.” Also, hospitalization deaths much much higher among unvaccinated, adults point anti-vaxxers. frankly, choice, let them. consensus seemed controlling transmission vaxing still unvaxed 12+ soon eligible 12s much important widespread boosters fully vaxed people.

Clotting, heart attacks, myocaditis/pericarditis present several orders magnitude higher disease vaccine. GBS exceedingly rare documented, also true flu shots. sign waiver basically says GBS risk, albeit uncommon one. Finally, vaccinated still spread covid, 5 times less rate unvaccinated.

Nothing put body consent Fewer 5 100,000 myocarditis also side effect actually getting covid, 3x likely.

Do source ""60% people die within 5 years""? telling people go forget guns loaded start shooting other? Follow science unless feel like it? billions need vaccine. data support it. young healthy individuals small, temporary boost go back booster. Without evidence lasting increased immunity, there's reason waste shots it. especially true world billions still need vaccinated.   logic around old school anti-vaxxers long time. grain truth blown way proportion.

- CVS screener/scheduler: “Overweight obesity

Antivax care actual reason take vaccine, they're always moving goalpoast, name argument ""the vaccines developed fast"", ""covid flu"", ""there's microchip vaccine"", ""Covid Chinese ploy undermine west"". reason people come vaccinated honestly excuse. 


Besides that, what's idea here? investment developing medicines help people vaccinated got infected? people cannot take vaccine one reason another? what, give people care vaccines pretense argument might stop people already care vaccine argue good about, keep acting bad faith? makes sense. poorly written article saying medicine might development months prevent anyone acting good faith taking vaccine available months now. clear guidance get booster US? anyone overruling? going take off-prescription drugs, least figure safe, correct dose.

2. Infected asymptomatic
3. Infected symptomatic hospitalized
4. Infected, symptomatic, hospitalized
(5. Death - die, much less likely transmit)

You argue delineation among four different states that's see largely see it.

Before delta, people vaccinated less stayed states 1 2 small number getting states 3 4. time (again, delta), view asymptomatic individuals unlikely enough viral load transmissible.

However, delta, appears people getting states 3 4 - hypothesis (I'm academic treat POV) COVID always highly transmissible get states 3 4 even variants delta states 3 4 rare previous variant.

Unsurprisingly, anti-vaxxers deliberately ignorance twisting stochastic nature COVID infection deterministic relationships. let get straight, article journalist wrote 2 people taking medication recovering two weeks, DONT EVEN KNOW PLACEBO?

Agreed disagree.  need therapeutics finally get fully this. treat home definitely done it. state Georgia, 544,093 people avoided testing positive Covid fully (Click LEARN button near bottom page download pdf)  really big problem.. study shows might contagious less time, you’re packed bar time viral load still high… asymptomatic you’re exposing others.  thought said stored cold longer? I’m Germany good level vaccination. currently seeing wave much higher point last year (where masks social distancing much stricter) despite far people vaccinated.

Same Netherlands huge spike relaxed restrictions. much shot enough. feels like price gouging point. could stop misleading folks vaccine effectiveness. everyone getting sterilizing immunity mean concept apply.

You way less likely catch covid 19 vaccinated. that's 'you catch it, asymptomatic'. PCR testing catch viral loads genuinely tiny, yet, test vaccinated people exposure, see incredibly powerful protective effect compared unvaxxed. Anti-vax crowd still try spin this. 1 month away able vaccinate children

We've already started vaccinating ages 12-15 (only one dose), indication plans vaccinate younger children Norway currently plateauing cases surge

Obviously, issue. recent record numbers less 1/3 hospitalizations peak that. Rule thumb Filipino party, cook enough food everyone attending eat bring home Yeah, COVID going select mutation less-deadly endemic state, actually humanity's immune systems drive that.  ITT: no-one actually reading details said beyond quote headline. Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol thought asking actual restrictions get way everyday life. want debate political philosophy semantics, you’ve got wrong guy. don’t think it’s fair businesses customers stop alcohol sales 10pm already vaccination testing requirement effect. absolutely favor vaccine mandates.  would achieve needs changed precisely? Basically like overly touristed destination. first called ""information superhighway"" supposed bring us pinnacle world knowledge. much like famous world tourist destination, internet virtual equivalent destination also giant seedy tourist trap springs around main destination, eventually swallows main destination. anyone afraid flu politicized? We've never given much extra thought flu generally ter behavior we've big public health discussions worry that's coming. Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol actually address anything said post. even give simple ""yes"" ""no"" question whether study posted peer-reviewed published, calling study know vaccines far, far safer catching covid. logic, infection reinfection same, you’d also recommend multiple covid infections vaccines boosters. Like, tf actually actually recommends this?? lol

The problem putting words mouth. made claim regarding incidence reinfection un-vaccinated persons made counter-claim. Never say, ""don't get vaccinated, catch COVID instead"". simply asserted said logically counter-intuitive, factually questionable simply incorrect. mean do. happens kooky conspiracy theorists included CDC remains consistent listed conditions make people likely get severe illness, pretty obesity, smoking, pregnancy, hypertension among many conditions included. reflects large significant percentage US population. Something needs change that's sure. get booster you’re smoker (a population specifically pointed out) - frontline healthcare worker! 

Don’t worry, we’ll get guys back nurses appreciation week! Free pizza! :)

It doesn’t matter much provide, healthcare worker always seems like you’re left behind. frustrating. makes lot sense also big problem messaging

I can't argue there. whole thing shit show think administration better last, that's necessarily saying much either. also, high risk includes BMI 25 adults, unless change Maybe understanding concept application concept difficult?

It's neither. people liking told plain simple. ""Do lower chances around you"" magically turns ""communism"" listener selfish, angry, stupid. bus weeks ago, guy gets chin, driver stops tells pull get off, gets off. route runs hour. genuinely don’t understand mindset leads waiting hour next bus better pulling mask already on. Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol Yeah, maybe go story ask ain't fittest pulling strings us. let know. Tomorrow? Officially, no. FDA unanimously recommended CDC rejected 6-9 vote. underlying medical condition 65+. 

Unofficially, like whether immunocompromised, whether 'high risk' self-attestation (just say are) anyone get one. Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol Well.... Survival fittest guess. hey bring us hippies man, like... peace love. go pharmacy say high pressure something. cares. True, principle same. vaccinated teacher breakthrough case, spread kids easily someone isn't. booster would reduce chances breakthrough case therefore reduce chance spreading kids. Uh, ""not special person"" co creator AstraZeneca soon could afford it, abandoned hometown &amp; moved closer large city. I've got lot health issues, much easier within range specialists. family lives, minimum 30 minute drive closest hospital emergency center. got new dollar store, headline news. Things move really slow there. Gets revved 'excuse' commit violence wants do. hard go assault someone w/o adrenaline feeling righteous indignation. may manufactured wife mind read one toxic websites types frequent rage 'fix'. Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol  agree that? think you’re least mostly right. also big problem messaging. presented protect unvaccinated idiots themselves, could stomach slightly honestly. messaging implies vaccinated danger too, I’m read-up enough topic know part that’s true least broad sense, hate a) “we’re” “punished” idiots even b) hate implies everyone risk puts fairly negative aura onto vaccines. accurate guidance get booster 6 8 months 2nd dose? keep hearing both. kind buried lead [all way comment think less people ""dummies"", put reason, original comment vague somewhat misleading. Hell, could included take thought experiment, since everyone practiced legal discourse, reaction probably would completely different. 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬  Sanity dutch 12 year olds judges anyway. dad moron. guarantee compare care healthcare workers anti-vaxx healthcare workers would find difference quality care. talking Marin County incident? I’m pretty sure teacher unvaccinated.  Yeah, quite confusing. offered financial bribes lotteries offered 3-piece 2 sides soda.  Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol Dutch text explained kids 12 consent corona vaccination, hence kid could gotten without judge dad involved. sure judge decided rule anyway, probably make statement sort Hope agree also, afraid walk opposite direction means helping ones got left behind. FAQ puts better could I'll try summarize. mRNA vaccines development decades. One recent technological breakthroughs 2005 using modified nucleosides evade immune system payload could delivered. Moderna Biontech founded years based part technology. mRNA vaccines diseases happened nearing clinical trials pandemic hit.

The pandemic helped accelerate development three main ways. First removes administrative hurdles. going straight front line review. People going called weekends vacation need be. Second funding. massive injection funds towards technology countries pre-purchasing vaccine redirecting internal budgets. move lot quicker money issue. Instead getting bottlenecked instrument manufacturing process throw money run things parallel. Lastly clinical trials. Lots people clamoring join vaccine trial could hopes protecting helping cause science. Also nature highly infectious widespread disease means hit target number infections quicker need calculate vaccine efficacy.

The nobel prize medicine announced early October. calls Katalin Karikó receive it. Find pos, vaccinate fuck throw ass soft Canadian jail. RSV kills 10-15K adults year. Influenza 50K. really know COVID's final endemic state look like yet, could anywhere common-cold-coronavirus influenza worse. It'll still deadly elderly kids. right, eventually everyone getting initial exposure young. Delta's r0 \~7ish, RSV \~3ish. must keep wearing mask altering lives multitude ways!

Ultimately things prevent asymptomatic spread vaccinated unvaccinated.

Health officials whatever keep unvaccinated hospitals much possible, even help themselves. can't throw hands let chips fall may, healthcare system would collapse. suck. objectively bad, find way better that. Science can, should, will, continue march onwards longer case, could take years decades.

It also level death society handle indefinitely, unlike previous peaks 100% extra excess deaths. numbers supposed be?  sorry that's true. physically possible hold gun a) forget loaded b) leave finger trigger ready shoot.

I never realised physically impossible forget gun loaded!

The natural way carry unbroken gun barrel butt. finger *shouldn't* trigger certain could paying attention.

This supposed break store guns moving stands. everybody guess someone probably never touched gun, know make assumptions.

Well sure intricate knowledge shooting ranges somebody that's never touched gun!
It's literally sport guns go own.

Guns good condition made last couple decades go own. Guns made guns otherwise bad condition can, however right thinking uncommon note, point making.   Thank Mandate take vaccine, you? Fine, quit! Good luck replacing *me*! Huh? Wait, no. like that! concerns raised panel scientific nature, policy concerns whether recommending boosters add confusion public discussion prevent first-doses sought among yet vaccinated.

Allowing individuals self select whether high risk occupations would prefer additional protection symptomatic breakthrough (which panel *did not* consider benefit boosters) still follows recommendations. identify, bioinformatics peptide cleavage assays, two cleavage sites furin, ubiquitously expressed protease, located S1/S2 interface S2′ position protein.   key feature coronavirus proteolytic cleavage events lead membrane fusion occur interface receptor binding (S1) fusion (S2) domains (S1/S2), well novel position adjacent fusion peptide within S2 (S2′) (11,  interesting question! 
However, particular study examined blood samples newborns mothers vaccinated pregnancy. 
Hopefully, future studies provide answers question raised. ""I affected effective antipsychotics"", said flat affect. schedule booster now? step we’re waiting for? cause second third order affect people choose getting vaccinated.

Maybe ... point overwhelming majority population vaccinated sort drug available, matter? It’s Ricky Bobby logic. it’s legit medicine humans don’t understand people keep calling horse paste.

Because people overdosing fact eating horse paste. getting prescription ivermectin tablets pharmacy.  “Controlling Diseases Center” maybe? way don’t replace merch uniforms.   Take 4 pills! news, far away FDA EUA? Would rather die, take 4 pills? Anyone half brain slightest modicum PR experience could told headline matters. 

Scientists stick science get professionals run communications. sociologists, economists, need stop pretending like are. experts wool gathering needing use vaccines elsewhere instead using protect Americans paid lost track reality. 

We always knew vaccines would need boosters. wait waves vaccinated Americans wind hospitals recommend them?  Let's see actual science support claims. observations amongst friend two count. multiple ""studies"" claims FLCCC effectiveness ivermectin.

You're straight full shit. fully vaccinated masker said live area Florida 40% positivity rate. us vaccinated getting it. people know point last 2 months. maybe states positivity cases high place like Florida covered disease us vaccinated protected. said 100% vaccinated way better time getting not. friend right way healthier 10 years younger, ICU, not. benefits real live place really high cases definitely still risk getting fully vaccinated masking. original number 1 1000, 1 100000. ""well meaning folks"" liken warriors public health safety

Those people zealots really frustrating deal them. totally jumped Twitter responding tweet event asking masks would still required case numbers went event. event requires full vaccination attend, even.

A simple innocent question got pegged antimasker people said pretty nasty things.

I also got lot shit random strangers going event past August. called murderer might spread virus got home, despite fully vaccinated event requiring masks.

People nuts. Gonna call bs one. literary first one get name profile. Everybody asks Rygel? interesting name.... Dominar? like bondage something... Lol Frell 😎 numbers look good, wish places publishing information number exemptions approving.    done here, change around early 2019 hospital able provide volumetric chambers everyone. Don’t blame me, that’s done. 

You understand public hospital setting 3rd world country. 🤷 I'm sorry that's true. physically possible hold gun a) forget loaded b) leave finger trigger ready shoot.

But guess someone probably never touched gun, know make assumptions.

Also, guns go own. I’m molecular biologist. actually understand scientific method. understand beginning, idea public wearing masks almost universally panned scientific community N95s needed medical community, masks thought porous prevent spread virus. took physicists convince epidemiologists virologists masks made cotton could prevent spread aerosolized particles. 

I’ll honest, haven’t read Fauci’s emails, spend time reading journals actual science know real reason guidance masks changed. don’t risk factors, it’s hard stay alive.

Talk data manipulation, fact don’t segregate mortality rates healthy vs high risk? Legitimately everyone family COVID, nobody died.

You’re focusing wrong thing…risk factors matter. incorrect. plenty betacoronaviruses found nature furin cleavage site, including genesis polybasic (furin) cleavage site spike protein SARS-CoV-2 subject recurrent speculation. Although furin cleavage site absent closest known relatives SARS-CoV-2 (Andersen et al., 2020), unsurprising lineage leading virus poorly sampled closest bat viruses divergent spike proteins due recombination (Boni et al., 2020; Lytras et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). **Furin cleavage sites commonplace coronavirus spike proteins, including feline alphacoronaviruses, MERS-CoV, strains mouse hepatitis virus, well endemic human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 (Gombold et al., 1993; de Haan et al., 2008; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016). near identical nucleotide sequence found spike gene bat coronavirus HKU9-1 (Gallaher, 2020), SARS-CoV-2 HKU9-1 contain short palindromic sequences immediately upstream sequence indicative natural recombination break-points via template switching (Gallaher, 2020). Hence, simple evolutionary mechanisms readily explain evolution out-of-frame insertion furin cleavage site SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2 analyzed phylogenetic relationships coronavirus spike proteins mapped furin recognition motif tree. **Furin cleavage sites occurred independently multiple times evolution coronavirus family, supporting natural occurring hypothesis third moderna bad first two; first two horrendously bad. It’s pathetic. care about. universe knows wasn’t born type family, would definitely say something. Here’s would settle debate, would ask: evidence booster dose preventing breakthrough case otherwise reducing chance could spread virus patients care for?

If answer yes, prevent breakthrough case reduce risk patients, feel path clear.

Just two cents. Thank care others. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

The disagreement whether focus efforts increasing effectiveness vaccine willing vaccinated versus continuing try convince unwilling get vaccinated.

At point, I'm sure amount effort going convince anti-vaxxer. Even among ones know speak real life, reasons give already debunked repeatedly. going happen. Holding hope contrary wasting time could getting working willing help end pandemic. US also never get one come sort consensus messaging. Message be: get X% vaccines, restrictions gone. state gets first, remove state. Get booster X, Y, Z group, protection only, vaccines still great working great. bring back mandates unless ICU usage state goes X% number days. remain X% Z number days.  Possible, yes, likely.  Yes, we've found furin cleavage nature coronaviruses. That’s terrifying. last thing need crazies trying break loved ones ICU. hospital staff don’t enough absolute shit deal with. Nightmare scenario someone comes armed. Facebook leaving garbage up?  still get spread it. unlikely still possible. Also last year proven anything humans incapable using honor system easier everyone mask, like lot ask anyway, piece fabric. Plus get added benefit sorts illnesses spread much, wish masks worn often even without pandemic lot countries. sit view 99% medical professionals expertise epidemiology, immunology, virology. can't imagine say junior accruing $75,000 student loan debt kicked outta school. One retiring  decision left local administrators hospitals

If working hospital, pandemic communicable, need get vaccine. literally around people whose immune systems compromised.

Not mention, doubt science behind vaccine, believe anything else said field? illogical. so, many reputable sources Reddit answer basic question probably already know answer given pro-vaccines (which great, btw). amount asymptomatic cases vaccinated individuals also reduced would love see studies that

It's pretty early days thing. Nevertheless, way vaccines work general? would doubt would case case? furin cleavage site spike protein

We found furin cleavage site nature. rodents. no, cross species mix ""uncommon"".

Let scientists speak, collectively, years, correct conclusion reached. Unless ""lab made theorists"" produce large quantity high quality research, conspirators. “I’m judging black…” 

That don’t see hypocrisy illuminating.  haha idiots! many people died vaccines New Mexico?

None. find statistic show it. Otherwise stop trying spread misinformation.

The vaccine safe. free. Unlike invermectin ou pay for, obviously safe. Logic classes added long list prerequisites education systems. Maybe someone make giant suppository Darwin, hard work. “Knocks commission 4-8 days” seems like inadequate reason take sort risk, matter small.   - boob job covered?
 - hip replacement considered ""elective"" sugery Haha yup. Turns people really know want ask them, actually observe see they're faced choice. want silver bullet. Yes. Nearly every statement video sourced screen references Part want buy ""Don't Fauci Florida"" t-shirt collectors item, I'm supporting monetarily.  Put bats step away slowly... dismissed replaced. usually respond with, “they prevent getting COVID passing on. they’re magical virus forcefields. reduce chances greatly.” really think people going take pill wont even take shot?

This confirms anti vaxxers qualms medical system.

We vaccine, gives people excuse get cause less people getting vaccinated.  vaccinated endanger everyone else? Source? thought groups defined yet. fair point, doomsday judicial activism scenario many feared court would devolve Trump appointments. there's branch government left working intended Supreme Court. Here's hoping, least. Exactly this.
