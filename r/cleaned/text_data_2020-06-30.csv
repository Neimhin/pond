But also, people die every single day car crashes well get injuries effect rest lives. outlaw cars dangers? No, put rules place protect people best let individuals make decisions. I’m saying dangers driving cars coronavirus equal honestly don’t know exact statistics pretend to. know cannot shut world shelter us danger virus. dangers face every single day depending profession, sign knowing fully.

Fellow Californian. I'm also astounded us opening back quickly; especially without cohesive expansive enough test-and-trace infrastructure place. **were** pretty well given initial size problem.

How hell prudence get tossed out? shaking head seeing FL, TX, AZ states essentially give up. Shocked CA seemingly followed suit. plus side community live takes things like masks social distancing seriously, continues so. mean... saying correct 21 million people unemployment last jobs report. high number fact open number improve. Right people blindly incentivised work many making money working working. system messed up. hope come new system. Maybe one applies additional financial aid cases increase something helps across board type UBI. think wrong Frontline workers like grocery store clerks hospital staff making considerably less bar staff unemployed. I'm saying people need helped go making $10/hour making $15+ working people harms way option get nothing extra? Amigo!!!! I'm metalhead, damn Amigo Devil's music beautiful &lt;3  intentions like people refuse join IDF (Isreal defense Force) want participate war Palestine different Trump Delaying person schooling entire year long term damaging effects like covid point something told to. Even advise good, saves lives, proof. shows extreme selfishness wear mask don’t want advised. advised, I’m honestly baffled. advised wear sunscreen, wear sunscreen science says it’s right thing do?   realize medical research drug development takes ***years***, right? can't answer ""does last 3 months"" 2 months data. big brain logic wouldnt surprised. One things always interesting amount family members live someone tests positive yet still test negative dont get despite spending every day them. “NOW that’s call STUPID, volume 122” honestly wish state would consult try implement crisis run ads explaining could generate money it. would make sense allow vulnerable populations ability stay home needed give parents freedom deciding fall. Haha can't cases test Yes, think lot going on. I've seen number stories nurses AZ saying people normally would admitted hospital sent home oxygen space. helps short term, percentage people back hospital soon, probably much higher percentage need ICU care road, treating inpatient setting rather sent home.

Banner larger hospital system AZ says 2 17 hospitals accepting patients right capped out. good hear... hope! Well that's loaded question likely know purpose.

At time protests, stayed home like months personally high risk complications life long asthmatic.

You're also trying set logical fallacy wedding protest literal life death situations gone control remotely thing. I'm going engage political argument. someone tell Arizona, every time test someone already test comes back positive, counts new individual case. source Fox News interview guy selling book, *his* source single anonymous hospital worker Phoenix.

Never mind fact logical explanation anybody would want show higher numbers actually are, especially incredibly inept incompetent state leadership.

People hear things don’t even think whether makes sense repeat over. personally think dining concept think Arizona set record high today. [Latino COVID-19 rates continue Arizona among several states, Texas, Florida, California North Carolina shown substantially increased rate COVID-19 among Latino communities.

[Coronavirus cases skyrocketing among communities outbreak worsens throughout South West, caseloads growing fastest counties large communities color. kids socializing all? People going get tired winning ...  guess also NYC protestors MAY cautious, recent experiences. places seen things probably much. It’s key. NY peak:

\- test positivity rate: 41%

Arizona now:

\- cases per million capita: 670

\- test positivity rate: 24% normal years there's tension locals middle class big city tourists 'invade' every year.

Yet article think truth** lies somewhere origin, intersection directions. Tourism provides, one must turn blind eye taking time.

Don't remember shared merely 6 days ago tourism collapse spring already putting Gotland's livelihood risk - here's remind ; 


P.S. notice older article ""economy"" chapter newspaper, one shared ""culture"" WA fire will, real avenue violation state mask mandate You’re right, it’s not. directly effects people’s (and entire cities) retirement, pension, etc.

The stock market important. Uh, conspiracy theory Florida fucking numbers months now? Till death us part?! Sure fuck it, that's like week tops. It’s clear making worse. Sure plenty people staying home making unemployment, jobs report refused return cut off.

The fact lot employers looking way need save payroll costs right keeps relationship employee ongoing. cut $600 forcing people back lot businesses forced lay person permanently much long term damage. useless, waste resources.  love getting voted expressing opinion infectious disease doctors.

Best luck you, thanks wife working COVID patients. hope stay safe. first hand anecdotal evidence Ohio, it’s less people using drugs struggling addiction, quality drugs. Record numbers people, including close friend back April, overdosing Fentanyl things fentanyl business in. said, I’m promoting drug use means, it’s sad they’re dying bad drugs. Like friend, assume many people don’t necessarily drug addiction problem, line buddies stuff get together it’s late. 

I assume stemming border crackdown. Meaning less supply, due Covid hardships 2020, demand still there, moreso. 

Which leads cutting corners seeing people pass away. hard compare used regularly able smell.

I opened jar pickles mean still smell pickle juice.

EDIT: smell coffee pretty decently too. wonder people going protesting every day we’re likely people areas would go back home, socially distancing times. spread would happened (while doubt was) would amongst reaching outside groups IRS ignore giant pile cash.jpg posted regarding regarding LabCorp apparently maxed testing availability, taking test kits away lower priority places. number areas spiking once, (I'm sure one surprised turn events) enough testing meet requirements.  Well, masks that's actually pretty open, course entire effort rests idea vaccine relatively quickly. Covid-19 mortality correlates Vitamin deficiency.

That's happened people survived h1n1 type Spanish flu. immune response. soon say. headlines young adults? middle aged people protesting masks? feel like literally live fear based hypothetical situations? couldn’t imagine.

Yet 29th June till 1st July - 23 664.  number tests fell third. number new infected fallen exact manner - 32%.  time, coronavirus test positivity percentage roughly time: ""record"" days range made 7,7 - 9,5% tests conducted, last three days - 6 10%.   numbers, secrets enhanced trends simple - began conduct third fewer tests. discovery rate correspondingly collapsed well.  time, nobody explains decided ""adjust"" tests **reduce number 12-13 thousand per day 6-10 \[thousand\].**  analyzing July's antirecords, reached grim conclusion - epidemic developed faster first month summer, number tests grown. Thus, coronavirus shown record number infected nine times June, bypassing mark thousand new cases.  forced authorities complex dilemma - whether make quarantine severe not. Yet ever since last antirecord, decisions would changed anything regards quarantines made.  Cabinet regional bureaucrats want cannot turn back process reopening.  official position central authorities thus: accessing coronavirus stats per region, local authorities must either tighten relax quarantine.  rather strange thesis - since earlier, number infected much smaller, Kiev introduced draconian measures across country, stopping \[public\] transport closing restaurants shops.  now, statistics reach antirecords, Cabinet suggesting might tighten quarantine - currently happening. rush resume restrictions locally either.  many reasons behavior, two main ones lack resources cover losses quarantine, exhaustion populations due restrictions. last factor fully used regional authorities, already entered local election campaign, scheduled autumn.  top, see really strange process take place - fall number PCR tests. automatically results ""enhanced"" statistics. obvious option wholly controlled Minzdrav, currently explained, number tests fell third past three days.  would MOZ need ""correct"" data infected?  answer comes mind attempt exclude Ukraine list stopping entry European Union. question decided European Council yesterday.

AZ hospitals implementing [crisis card may pushing people need help hospitals. 

Hospitalization hits cap, people turned away, discharged make room patients higher probability getting better. Gotland like 2 ICU beds total, wanting na enormous influx Stockholm tourists extremely justified worry, they're screwing drug useless virus. lost sense smell? bigot... protestors immune covid wondering people get emotional masks...

I always heard Americans smile strangers cultures do; wonder makes people uncomfortable masking? Especially south. New England , less friendly approachable strangers, whole people pretty good masking. 

There also probably generational thing play well; older people tend big fans face face interaction younger people prefer texting online interaction. 

There probably also subconscious bristling implication germy, unclean, contagious, extension dirty slovenly person. doubt people thought words probably sort underlying feeling. Hence intense anger asked mask; perceived insult. 

So end older people southerners disliking masks reasons probably can’t quite put finger on, since Trump masks latch onto not-masking political statement. 

In deeply blue New England town, not-masking immediately earn ire townsfolk Spreading Contagion also possibly Trump voter; intense social pressure favor masking - point people masking alone yards cars! No, still need act professional.

Naw, need robot. Remember Human applies customers employed minimum wageslave handle daily abuse jackshit compensation privelege

ok Yes! They're intense haha never family close friend me, I've able go ceremony, buffet/dinner day, reception, *massive* many parts them. loved brother's wedding (we're stereotypical American), definitely much tame overall. Brings back watching Las Vegas mayor feeling stupider Vegas tough times ahead. jesus. NYC peak? Thank helpful response. I'll still making less unemployment even extra $600/w. I'm eager get back work keep bills paid. Luckily knew would coming months able build decent cushion, trying buy house year can't get back decent work happen. Lol yeah understand mad people making obviously dumb bad decisions. stemming 1) Murdoch media blaming black lives matter protests people latching onto idea it’s fault putting countries problems ahead countries health 2) emphasis people breaking rules ignoring happened/are happening states there’s outbreaks. suggested got scolded another redditor overreaching .I'm Mink. several mink farms infected Netherlands. mink farms euthanized. No. pandemic every decision make untold effects people around you. Many people might never meet. “individual decision”. else remained same, death rate alone went up, disease would go global disaster global apocalypse.

Can imagine many people would already dead current infection numbers? We'd millions US alone. 60 minutes? move hospitals Texas Medical Center. includes several counties/hospitals outside Houston, still much part metro Houston area. They’re shipping God-forsaken place like Dallas. Either 99% sacrifice old weak old weak higher risk rest us return normal. former unreasonable considering almost certain longevity disease. cannot indefinitely sacrifice educational outcomes, socialization, small businesses, mental health, order protect vulnerable. stuck Udaipur traffic Mumbai Bollywood style weddings held palaces, hill, streets near hotels. think fought way home 1 Can’t answer contact tracing several protests rise positives 2-3 weeks ago 0 deaths yesterday. We’re seeing protest-related spike all, makes sense states likely seeing spikes people social distancing re-opening soon. also. Good call. still kills, lot people, even vaccine drugs.

So take risk - catch it, spread it, kill old people - probably do, trade-off make.

There's chance Covid - flu insignificant comparison.

We different levels risk v reward, all. close borders now. left right handled pandemic horribly US. right downplays like nothing worry left talks sides mouth want progressive points BLMs movement problem mate! partially did. prices drugs based cost create, they're based insurance companies willing pay. Hospital stays expensive insurance companies willing pay lot drug save even money shorter hospital stay Sometimes think people enjoy suffering others say right. I’m talking college. Primary school absolutely huge problem needs addressed I’m sure best answer. college different boat entirely. friend Arizona. took 3 days find opening test, physically go physicians office, 4 days since test still test results back. 


They lost smell, taste, symptoms mild case (headache, congestion, fever) I’m memory I’m sorry I’m misremembering. Looks like LA specifically. Depends guidelines state/county have. article talk employees aren’t using PPE, guests aren’t wearing masks limited cleaning supplies. Good call. keep numbers control spread. great, terrible. honestly know bothered commenting. better things waste time willfully ignorant trolls. Lol logical argument working like normal somehow struggle? think get sit around nothing government pay everything us? understand see wrong unaffected pandemic? say protests spread virus, that's probably ONE ASKING!

It's common sense mobs people shouting yelling, long periods time, many without masks (even masks, I'm suspicious claims protestors wearing masks) going spread virus around.

Is coincidence month protests, cases rising almost everywhere U.S? think not!

Is coincidence cases rising among young people, protesters disproportionately young people? think not! numbers include tourists , that's residence county, something like one thousand people infected yesterday You’re confusing lockdown opening everything. family NY. locking again. 

Maybe intermittent lockdowns? numbers go down. even won’t last. Sounds like ton dudes! Also, casinos. Awesome. work one. Theyre trying force quit cause dont want come in. Theyre packed theres way control everyone. Seriously. need start planning response healthcare systems Florida, Georgia, California, Texas start freezing up

I'm curious, think planning? that’s contact tracing works. don’t ask specific events. ask case two days prior onset symptoms (or test) let tell story contact tracer follow up. it’s job contact tracer approach person loaded question. rely case honest take face value. good job, suss truth.

If ask you: tell day yesterday? We’re home go out? 

I out.
Can tell that?

It’s detective work. never ever ever lead case contact loaded questions like:

So we’re protest?

It leads person give right answer hide truth.

Correct tracing able correlate across many case interviews pattern...


so bullshit article. want tell you, good luck. We're counting you. would people already covid recovered need get vaccine? would students campus? ask establishment think got at, may able name one. It’s Trumps give away. Technically, many middle eastern people considered caucasian keep finger report button. know mean Latin Roman here, right? Odds damned Yes, though worth noting pretty decent medicine time, including pneumonia serum. Unfortunately antibiotics developed Great War, germ theory disease - even thought Spanish Flu caused another bacterium found pneumonia patients (Pfeiffer's Bacillus, *was* responsible many opportunistic pneumonia cases, able treat it). technology required study microbes smaller bacteria, viral disease still well supported theory.

But yeah, every case COVID-19 required hospitalization fatal, would par Spanish Flu. since modern treatments COVID-19 include things like concentrated oxygen intubation, likely doctors 1918 would helpless COVID-19 Spanish Flu.

As proof, isolated believe Spanish Flu victim buried permafrost - H1N1. went another round one long ago came hellova lot better (though granted, *also* trying kill time). mean think contributed sure, cities happened. we're still seeing increases, albeit less extreme, cities never got far re-opening indoor spaces real capacity, like mine example.

And they're still trying peddle bullshit like ""Uhhh... guess came graduation parties?"" Like yeah, sure Kai, gathering 30 people field one afternoon causes rampant COVID, thousands people spitting every day month doesn't. Makes perfect fucking sense. targeted places larger gatherings occur cluster infections result from. Retail Stores really high risk place (assuming overcrowded people wearing masks) Yep. turns protesting outside wearing masks relatively low risk compared eating inside. Sunlight, airflow restricted, increased heat also contributing factors reduced infection rates protesting outdoors. imma rock doctors scientist working instead “kindlybasket”

now kindly ask keep pessimism notifications. mean... pretending people work jobs interact general public? Presuming work one jobs, world would expected guess gave you? Recognize sarcasm, frankly, ICUs make little money hospitals yet make highest costs.  Woah new contender? instant covid tests avalible point.

Many many people suffer they’re written “just anxiety” “psyching it” drs didn’t want look far enough, (far rarely) weren’t able to. Autoimmune disorders one illnesses got ignored dismissed “hysteria”. real malicious. gaslighting happens patients hidden illnesses incredibly damaging. Yeah, say they're upset, Big Daddy Warbucks comes flashing money, everybody's selling. Well, father’s son I’m situation you. pandemic benefits running weeks, given state things, getting new job even harder given fact may shut soon due Abbott’s bullshit. don’t want work somewhere doesn’t see coming isn’t remote already.

That said, think Abbott lockdown eventually. Lt Dan say whatever bullshit wants he’s making decisions, cares looking good nutty cons adults handle problem, leaving free criticize sidelines.

Abbott eventually choice. ignore hide numbers deaths want. Hospitalizations unavoidable truth. system collapses weight, re-election chances become vulnerable, matter far future are. agreed. fucking love way irish people talk Meanwhile, south, cases 3x Michigan seeing, DeWine still nothing Ohio. Kings Island theme park opens tomorrow, right middle SW Ohio surge.  really really hope enough PPE.... Queen save God? Young adults? old Alt-Righters believed Fox News Trump medical facts.  many people getting sick dying can't afford social distance. people. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* i'll even take one step you.

What virologist ""thinks"" evidence incoherent rambling infant. ""not evidence"" far ""also evidence"". Try get thru thick skull. unaware previous coronavirus vaccines going human testing unintended side effects. referring to? Badly designed designed purpose getting specific wrong answer? 

Statistics good questions asked clever asking... get whatever answer looking less. Damn, must invisible like 99% G P making thing political. ""oh let's wear mask want mandate it, also let's throw largest rallies tightest spaces possible!""

Then rid blame saying ""oh 1st amendment means people go please"" 

130,000 people dead here. people care guys charge.

Just face it, leaders suck man. nothing reddit. Possible wouldnt spread nearly much many people would died instead actually walking around without knowing spreading yep... anyone groups anything huge risk. least outside bar. Seriously, Riverside, Orange County, LA heartbeat away us, Arizona right next door. People places already flooding SD. ): ""I want juices!"" sit around crying extra $600 dries money, idk else tell you. people looking work, every one threads filled people saying take jobs available cuz ""bellow them"" they're making unemployment currently. fail realize they're making cuz government supplied limited time boost unemployment. fine dandy stick pride want, quit bitching lose extra gov assistance. knew date coming, said since day one. pull surprise pikachu face follow ending it. point taking job would knowing cares act deadline extended. people need wrap heads around idea many jobs coming back, field work may thing need find something different. sucks that's reality. Depends state maybe? max amount collect, cause, know, bills go away awhile /s protesters actually going give government information? 

""Yes. protesting cops government. Here's info track me."" Summary: 

* White House says US secured 500,000 doses Americans, representing nearly Gilead’s production capacity next three months
* European countries say stocks set aside; South Korea plans talks buy August that’s phase 3 is... large scale human trials

and propose testing long term side effects 6 month they’re changing enough components cause long term damage

there way know change protein covering match covid 19 virus.

yeah that's changed turn harmless bat virus covid 19. tiny changes huge effects biology. anyone statistics:

Scroll select Texas look excess compare covid deaths northern San Diego county resident say please come weekend. article word ""socialite"" title almost guaranteed total dumpsterfire stupidity privilege. saw article someone found shitload test samples river there. unable find figured happened yet. Part took additional month places actually open back up. I'd say Mother's Day weekend seemed like public perception starting change. then, Memorial Day, everything re-opened varying levels safety measures. least around north Atlanta. Bingo. Spread began December didn’t surge March. It’s reasonable think we’re seeing window happening May/early June. LOL. source, news article. Per article, CDC gives upper bound 35% asymptomatic carriers. Fauci's upper bound 50%.

Look guy, ""LOL"" easy dismissal. Textbook example someone interested discussion eager prove superior is. comment pure masturbation, feel dirtier made part it.

In case, whole point article number pretty hard nail moment. quote multiple sources numbers, including CDC. sure think CDC holy case. numbers mentions linking credible sources. Blood research Netherlands supports 80% number 35% one. fact, point even either 80% 35%, explained well. took safe upper bound purposes particular point making, strengthen point fact weaken show would take long time reach heard immunity either case. hang EVERYONE know drunk I'll talk manner strangers. 

I going time soon. Lol Iran came Italy, much information obviously. NewYork, New Jersey Connecticut overcome March April flattening even downturning curve. That’s good news! 

Dexamethosone steroids given right time major impact illness. Anti- clotting medicines helping too.

Serious illness children remains very, rare. 

Remember news reports people complying. people best stay safe. True. I'm middle building house whole craziness fully expected drop current home's sales price actually gone up. know supply new homes low expected national pandemic high unemployment. look Arizonas count day. went 3500 cases day 600? Yeah, sure. test faith dear boy/girl. You’re right. It’s closest Vermont. It’s actually colder say Canada’s populous city (Toronto) US. Places Boston, Milwaukee, Detroit.  90% Canada’s population lives within hour US border. 1 million people dead France much worse 1 million dead people US? That’s pretty sick way apply per capita. 300,000 Americans going die Trump want face bronzer get smudged. ""our essential workers heros"" wear mask help keep safe. I'm sorry everything going hope get better soon ONE TALK SWEDEN *doesn’t* mean that. protests accounted maybe 0.1% interactions people - never significant begin with. 

Furthermore, protests affect behavior non-protesters - increases social distancing overall. people upvoting flawed logic without evidence? opposite - they’re brilliant. Write sing lowest-common-denominator bullshit pander stupid people tons $$$. Like people work Fox News, bit less evil. Outdoors helps adequate social distancing

Please take look protest videos tell keeping 2 meters apart ah yes, covid19, place pseudo-science pre-prints! clearly able read substitudide lazy read yourself. stupid understand contense, one hand, please feel free ask, gladly explain you.  Well ask nobody else would blessed. *universe starts* air drop ""Covid waste"" China? large land mass. english good, i’d like start complimenting clearly pretty good progress. science hand...iffy best. make mistake, aren’t weaker versions virus going around. people deal better based various factors like age, immune system, get idea. however, ability pass “weaker” version someone else still real could absolutely kill them, despite harming first person much.

your testing information also quite incorrect. although US testing country, relative amounts tests come close many global cases US has. US 25% worlds covid cases 4% world population. however US testing 6.25x greater rest world, like 1.6ish, although tricky thing measure countries using various units. however, without doubt, nowhere near 6.25 needed statement reason us cases high testing factually correct. 

also, given everyone country must get virus. fact, thats less likely outcomes. look rest world clear. point US may get point, yet. CERTAINLY avoid point countless countries around world have. since we’re “best, richest, strongest, resilient
country world” theres doubt better. Yep.

Stay safe practice precautions! money can't buy common sense Thank discussion, felt hopeful, people ask insightful questions willing consider evidence like you, situation bad. saw coverage anti-quarantine protests Michigan, people freely accusing protesters spreading covid-19. came BLM protesters, comments seem muted themselves. Seems pretty hypocritical me. Idk people Florida, I've gotten one check far. Lol. Bezos many people defending Elon would tearing this.

It's hypocrisy.

You guys concocted ""conspiracy theory"" around OP posts yet constantly accuse posting ""conspiracy theories"". rarely ever add anything discussion unless forced (see below) instead focus efforts attacking OP daring even post topic.

It pretty clear suppress information like rather post information yourself. example, posted sum total 4 threads reddit, one anything topic.

Yet always try prevent people posting information believe important.

Why that? Bicuspid valve. 1 year old it. got caught born EKG came back kind weird due chamber fully closing yet (that happens usually, did, self resolves), since caught bicuspid valve means he's higher risk infections getting heart developing murmurs later, eventually might need valve replacement. pretty treatable huge risk one ""fall field"" types things go long enough checking it. doubt huge risk want avoid getting COVID especially know higher risk, especially much COVID seems target circulatory system.

Fun fact everyone. Boy Scout Camp Geronimo AZ fully open 250+ kids 70 staff moment stay mad cuckie imagine Cuomo argued, Density reason NYC outbreak. Since SW less dense rely subways, need close businesses.

Instead, abundantly clear, unwillingness political actors take controversial action. generally order shutdowns refrigerator trucks roll hospitals, time act 3 weeks ago. soon saw uptick cases, paused, investigated correlated uptick, reversed reopens.

Or, put another way, political leadership unwilling look like overreacted. ""Why worry? us wearing unlicensed nuclear accelerator back.""

First price fixed. Second US ensured many countries cannot get supplies while. 

The temporary licenses generic versions limited developing countries significant health care hurdles. Europe, Canada, believe even Brazil many countries (~70 them) cannot get generic either. none generic manufacturing set fully yet either. Lol.

/s no. It’s June000 30th000 regret locking down. that's overall trend, cases spiking, shutdown, cases spike, shutdown - that's still steady growth, Texas shown signs flattening curve yet; slowed down, never flattened. recent numbers show going back up. course, watch everyday see decisions governors (and people) decide make (or make). start see curve flatten direction changing, destination 10% year without drastic measures. course, hope I'm wrong.

Edit: Btw, 40k cases per day 80 days straight. exponential growth 80 days. example start 160,000, total today. next 80 days # cases increase 4%. multiplying 160,000 1.04 80 times. use calculator try yourself. first couple days adding 6k-7k cases. end adding 150k cases. Per day. growing. That's exponential growth.

Well, can't reply keeps getting removed. reason polarized someone made way. picture? significant difference COVID-19 numbers areas protesting, thats why. People downvoting really wanted information, could look up.

Instead, without facts, say protests direct cause lot deaths play victim saying can't say publicly without labeled BLM. crap, clearly BLM stating media covering negative impact assume exists, fact, doesn't.

ETA:  stock fell two reasons. First, company release much information antibodies competitors. Second, stock 800%, simply high. perfect rather good result baked in. I’m advocating opening anything. it’s pretty clear locations need immediate severe corrective actions. Florida hospital employee here.

Yeah, that's going happen. Y'all paying attention wrong things. could it, freeze property taxes too. Unfortunately alot places revenue hugely dependant it, half NYCs yearly revenue comes alone. 

The problem everyone home also lose sales commodities tax. Plus paying god knows much money unemployment, state benefits got recipe state bankruptcies across country. 

If representatives would stop giving billions stock market corporations would plenty money bail states this.

As seen though, shit happen. part seem forget actually economy, companies.

He's handling it....passably, properly. best say shitshow expected outset. bar set low enough trip despite rotundness able make over. Also around 14 days symptoms, severe cases get gradually severe. wuhan study saw beginning outbreak showed people hospitalized around day 10 symptoms died, occurred around day 18 symptoms free 21. appeared get progressively worse done - one way other. 

So positives going increase ahead hospitalization, take longer shut downs ultimately bring hospitalization week+ Car crashes definitely utilize lot ventilators.

The country needs competent leadership. It’s going get any, that’s directly fault party thinks electing incompetents virtue.

Every dead body fault. Thanks we're kind happy too! I've watching numbers closely. great news course, seeing what's going rest country make feel better anything public. know I'll even consider bringing 9 week old first restaurant... 2021 maybe? one hand, many people believe reality, hearing made false, want take walk ICU see husband wife laying side side intubated seeing 26-year-old comorbidities laying hospital bed 14 days intubated state say, ""It real."" tiresome. doomers sub never admit wrong overestimated. always say ""just give two weeks."" could fired handling tough situation unprofessional manner. retired governor California awesome actor always awesome body builder tells wear mask, happily comply Okay, okay. got me. almost like it’s propagan da discredit protesters. would never want live Canada...

Good, stay away good, many people island like boss says overreaction. saying tiny bit south. Adding retail restaurant companies hitting time highs, they're understaffed case restaurant chains, they're without overhead expenses house dining. need raising employee wages employees entitled additional hazard pay health benefits. US doesn't, there's plenty good data countries excellent contact tracing wide scale testing. wear mask whenever public. seems like basic courtesy. idea federal mandate first time thought wearing one. going send FBI agents lock non mask wearers? think equally prosecuted? think poor people rich people prosecuted wearing masks? Seems like great way harass homeless. thought country currently whole giant police state thing. like door prize. can’t testing. It’s still hard get tests lot places. Unless you’re critically ill need know COVID determine best course treatment.
A better indicator would number hospital admissions. hospital admissions up, community spread and...yup got maxed ICU’s TX.

Now bit anecdotal reasoning; everyone office going vacation right now, mainly Florida Tennessee. don’t believe masks come back one wears in-office. 

I’m trying lead example started wearing one office. I’ve vacation I’ll damned give someone else caught work.

(I’m fairly certain won’t symptoms since close members family contracted little symptoms.)

When asked wearing shared little story learned “mask=jeans virus=piss. Would rather someone piss bare leg? jeans? would rather piss jeans wearing jeans?” (I figured putting terms ‘piss’, something readily understand, they’d get masks work virus)

They’re response “uh huh, yeah sure. Well thanks pudding you’re jeans.”

What trying say completely went heads. virus still hoax them...not sure....

Anywho, done rant,

Thots &amp; Prayers, Thots &amp; Prayers! recall old ~~repost~~ joke:

I can't wait become proud American! 

I'm already American, I'm proud. Florida like China America looked stats much? increase due increased testing, seem actual increases cases, yet time affect death rate? mean hard worse everyone Beverley Hills lives Beverley Hills. think going take longer that. current problems anti-vaxxer anti-maskers thank. That's exactly article arguing...

Anyone super spreader right circumstances everyone needs take virus seriously. Yes. Rogan's pushing comedy clubs UFC open he's happy audience stand shoulder shoulder crowded space, telling masks ""bitches"" , pays thousands dollars weekly vitamin IVs private covid tests. LOL Zach Bryan. cool where‘s prize😞 Curious artist/song is. let French citizens in. Thank wishing well. money comes first foremost best guess Hmm, won’t affect me. basically made opposite ambition. Somebody help us. Please, beg you. Stop. People read NYT article first place intelligent enough understand anyone could super spreader right circumstances therefore everyone needs take seriously follow social distancing rules. 

You can't seriously argue suppressing discussing epidemiology virus morons might misinterpret science. 

And science exactly countries curve flattened basing policies now. can't lockdown forever, best option minimise situations superspreading take place. exactly US states need do. others still need lockdown. read article spiking cases rural texas I’m sorry endure this, sucks many shitty people there. I’m sorry endure this, sucks many shitty people there. I’m curious continued suffering akin bad case flu bad bout bronchitis. bronchitis December wasn’t really better March. think case bronchitis decades ago gave lung scarring. something like whole new level lingering effects? watch video, hand gestures delivering speech reminds someone well. didn’t get billed test never one done. comment doesn’t make sense great what? Please explain, detail, virus going get car windows up... didn’t get billed test. went ER got bunch imaging diagnostic work, chose high-deductible health plan. story dumb wildly misleading NPR. What's wrong emergency supply TP? tp police? Li Wenliang Chinese ophthalmologist worked Wuhan Central Hospital.  Outbreak timeline.

Unless infect human intentionally observe progression empirical without proof. fine, reality assert violence late November/ early December. collect win get there. said regarding observed phenology adult infect child, may infect children seldom infects adults unknown, miraculous reasons, means children infected threat us economy.

Lick-isiana Couples fucking since they're home - probably planned (I dunno, I'm single bish used masturbating) actual conspiracy happening real time completely ignored drowned (by design) bullshit ""theories"" rampant social media days. Norway also contact tracing testing keep status quo. opened infection rates still low generally. prime Minister clear close see uncontrolled surge new infections (non traceable infections). smaller clusters able trace infections contact tracing. guess approach forward local close whole country parts see infection rates increase again. approach trace, quarantine/islotate stop spread gets uncontrollable. swear Sweden's plan. wont. apparently sticking individual entitlement, fake wealth, stolen property. Someone posted comment recent Fauci thread - comment short left right need split america right endangering everyone rejecting science (no masks movement, antivaxxers etc), left modern science, healthcare etc.

My comment reply saying - left widely support recent protests tens thousands people marching confined spaces? Surely counts rejection science also? think right idiotic rejecting masks (and comment worded - ignore right fucking dumb right now), left also rejecting science.

I mass downvoted replies hoping someone could enlighten me. think made totally fair point sub seems think otherwise check. chess. Good thing Europe lot time US then, no? Rarely, never someone already commented. hate say it, immediate family seriously considering begin making move.

My guess would lot employees. know ring crews, camera men etc.  1 20? read article today US, 2.9 million people infected 125,000 deaths. comes 0.043%.

I know numbers reflect reality bc testing limited entire time cause death accuracy great either. even 3x worse that's 0.15%. I'd surprised skew way people infected without counted.

Don't get wrong, still take pandemic seriously figure kills 5% first month? It’s funny, morons red areas keen joke blues high covid counts, they’re ones crumbling. wanted to, did, withhold aid. So, let bleed dry. think ppl protect one another evictions yea fight back, fair Anti-mask americans: hold beer! president stockpiled something like 25 million doses Hydroxychloroquine Covid-19 every study show work. anything, increases chances death. NIH funded studies taxpayer dollars. Meanwhile, Remdesivir funded Gilead. original $50 million got government treating Ebola, put billion now. exchange $50M, servicemen US military getting Remdesivir free, gave first 600,000 doses USA free well. 

Remdesivir silver bullet, helps. last moderate use study, reduced duration illness 30%, reduced chance dying quite bit too. (Not big enough sample gauge, two people died Remdesivir 4 it, yet control group half size would indicate 75% reduced death rate). steroid likely bigger breakthrough, it'll used conjunction Remdesivir. god no. spend good portion day - literally every day - helping others. would never say that. also would never lie people sugar coat situation. We're middle pandemic. getting worse again. Everyone needs prepare take care families.

I honestly understand hyper paranoid blue side isolated acting like masks humanities hope. also honestly understand red team saying fuck it. flu quit beung pussy. 

America supposedly 40,000 NEW cases yesterday seen shit, one bit evidence world disease, sickness. see news internet. new protocals businesses people wearing masks.

I usual thing, wash hands way hand sanitizer religiously now. Yup, coulda seen coming.

If one biggest countries take something seriously fucks everyone else.

Like whatever US always knock effect everyone else. ""how reddit works: guide, u/rad-aghast""

I’m stunned lack common sense people have. Hmm point taken , suppose think harder definitely seen flimsy looking cloth masks.

However, ones obtained directly dry cleaners / tailor shops feel much substantial better fitting blue yellow reusable ones see. slots insert sort paper towel filter wanted also, feel like I'm going somewhere exposed longer time usual I.e. Costco. 

I agree bar pretty low anybody wearing anything point hated on. Another dick move. Much done working together apart. (Canadian) work required masks face shields times well LOT measures. 

Personally dont wear mask I'm outside dog anything. 

But wear I'm going store.

I feeling perfectly normal Sunday afternoon suddenly felt scratchy dry throat phone call car. I've extreme panic mode ever since, ate drank barely anything time, although I've started try drink water since last night. 3-4 glasses last night one now.

In time, I'm also experiencing burning sensation breathing nose, nostrils inflamed. worse indoors cold A/C air, still noticeable outdoors.

I also feel hyper awareness teeth/gum pain. poor oral hygiene 4-5 years went dentist two weeks ago today get much-needed cleaning brought relief. kind feel heightened awareness dull aching. Might I'm subconsciously clenching mouth fear.

I fever, cough, real shortness breath (beyond panicking).

Can someone give reassurance? able feel like functioning human since Sunday. I've panicking freaking possibility mild COVID symptoms progress worse symptoms days come.

I guess could get test, scared swab, scared getting virus nurse already, feel like panic mode even heightened wait 1-7 days results.

I scared. Like panic 20 10, I've pacing condo pacing around school near building constantly. literally petrified can't snap it.

Thank much anyone answers. seriously unaware tremendously powerful economy earth built great month June? Sounds like time new window. need lungs top shape favorite hobbies

Me too, masturbation sessions exhaust already! School summer? Perhaps covid mutates early strains less potent.  also, near spring/summer time, perhaps covid didnt spread fast time mutate dangerous strain winter.  

remember, china's majority strain B strain, branched strain. Europe NY strain.  mean, I'm gonna live life, wont seeing vaccine several months, point staying inside anymore. Mouthwash? agree. They've working changed estimate finished, think that's good sign. funny meme lowest deaths per mile driven DC NY lower deaths per capita. I'm bit confused here. people supposed eat sit restaurants wearing mask? get take away sit cannot eat wear mask. Question sit makes sense anyways current situation. case, steroid abuse probably. Wow, that’s awful. horrible! One party rule all! No, still need act professional. lost credibility put mask smile. lost credibility right eyes. 

And, right file unemployment wants, ones forcing work. employed privilege, employee seems taken granted. First, try worry much that's possible.

For one thing, *way* people surviving - even elderly, even obese, even serious underlying conditions. sub sometimes makes easy think otherwise. virus serious, get wrong, odds *very* much favor contract virus, survive fine.

As far practical things... I'm doctor, **not** medical advice (please check doctor taking supplements proper medical advice based situation), things I'm keeping on-hand case hits household.

* Vitamin supplements - taking 2,500 IU day, plus multivitamin. 5,000 IU capsules standby get sick.
* Liposomal Vitamin C
* Quercetin
* Zinc
* Breathe Easy tea Traditional Medicinals
* Pedialyte
* Famotidine (generic Pepcid - there's interesting research showing could possibly help taken shortly symptom onset, least, figure hurt)
* Humidifier

I'm taking/using things right (except vitamin D), stashed away case illness. know they're necessary, really help, made feel better COVID kit together.

Beyond that, try eat healthy diet much possible. even lose weight, make sure keeping nutrients give best possible chance get it. Take walk can.

When wife comes home, strip clothes put directly wash (if washer home) hamper meant dirty clothes, shower change immediately.

Then hand-washing, regular deep cleaning high touchpoints (light switches, phones, remotes, etc) - usual stuff. There's fertility lost men too. living problems generations come. Get ready start seeing tent cities popping again. I'm confused arizona impacted hospitalizions deaths compared say Florida arguably amount elderly residents surge cases. likely positivity rate would lower FL lower amount testing week, probably quite 10K. certainly would lot higher they're reporting today, that's sure. 

I'm surprised testing cut back quickly. would think simple inertia would keep testing kinda high. mean, essentially health care professionals influence deciding test gets done not? number tests go quickly? you’re pessimist. it’s literally everyone’s best interest make free cheap possible. government already put billions aid production it. 

worst case scenario they’ll send another stimulus check around time pay vaccine put money pockets people entering general public again. 

the first weeks post vaccine crucial economy.  doomsday types squirrelly. need get fucking grip reality. 

Absolutely. Honestly way behave engineered towards self fulfilling prophecy. they're gonna cause situation they've hoping/preparing gun nuts figure owning semi-automatic weapon founding fathers mind kinda psycho.

They make fair point counter one ""Then first amendment apply Modern communication technology either"". boggles mind scares me.

I wish would enforce something like work. Workers wear mask three weeks coming back vacation, minimum. stopped people hoarding time supplies critically low. Certainly better reason Trump's lies.

Our city going implement random public testing sometime next month. researched, testing asymptomatic population combined relatively low prevalence disease population (there recorded cases local transmission city) result false positives true positives.

They're mean shield others you, shield others. Granting, I'm assuming least, asymptomatic - effects long term perhaps organs? guess I'm trying say asymptomatic, besides carrier, still hurting long term?

All jokes side, important studies field limit variables/effects. think don’t need publicized meaningless medical researchers clinicians. read today drug affect mortality, shortens length illness. Studies shown prevent death. They'll give Americans get admitted hospital charge $3000 privilege. That's one made US corporation partially funded research [$70M US tax contrary, elective surgeries haven’t happening, yet overall sepsis cases skyrocketed. Post op complications make significant portion overall septic patients. 

There explanation pneumonia case sky rocketing. patients tested Covid recently. DOA cases typically haven’t either due testing supply limits. test sources becoming available, see lay. Unless, say, Trump admin restricts supply tests due wanting higher numbers. sont know area, normal unemployment plus $2400/month actually lot people make working here.

This making employment problem much, much worse. Try Canada. think Europe super good idea honestly. Eastern Europe getting bad decade two climate refugees real problem. think India pharmacy leader kind operations, law enable bypass US patent, too. 

I know lot Chinese travel India buy cheap generic medicines, treat AIDS cancer. sources effects? lmao

my co worker pre pandemic went India sister wedding told 3 day event! Yeah, Enron type shit insinuating happened, 

Around 12th 15th March came herd immunity strategy. 

Professor Neil Ferguson releases model week suggests without lock 500k dead.

The following Monday government makes U turn herd immunity 28th went full lock down. 

It lockdown Neil Ferguson caught covid, meetings Boris members cabinet week lockdown caught it.

The failures happen, claiming herd immunity good idea, going lockdown late, allowing construction continue (generally luxury flats etc). Telling people go pubs yet letting pubs stay open providing financial support soon enough everyone. plan reacted problems arrived. Today, Netherlands,our government largely lifted lockdown, kids teacher thought nice hug everyone missed much.

Multiple kids sick, parents, one talks Covid more. past. virus gone. good thing, we're go holiday

Smh fucking hate people sometimes. lot times. kind amusing seeing “durrr dont erase history” crowd cant remember history three months ago (NY) even month ago (Iran).

Yes. 6 assisted living yesterday. 15 two days.

My stomach knots today. Data across board really bad. silver lining see growth rate total hospitalization seems leveling (up 400 last week 800 week that). contrast TX still shooting exponential growth

but record cases ridiculous positivity rates sure continue. guy personally fired guys like healthy ethical person VW.

VW currently busy blocking attempts EV usage Germany lobbying unions demand gas guzzlers jobs. would hope so. What's cheaper? Paying everyone get vaccinated medical costs, economic costs, etc actual virus? damn viking drugs think daydreamed something like once. like this. americans don’t job anymore
 

Source? think need market based solution:

Another solution thought making masks ""cool"" among young people getting ""cool"" brands make them. Get Drake create mask OVO fashion line, let Supreme make Supreme-branded masks, bet fly shelves. Poverty institutional. Framing sickness borne laziness makes idiot. Ouch. there, mess shoulders though. 

Safety? that? I'm changing middle name Danger legally probably. Russia insider reports say things bad there. There's way India third world country top 3 world's population okay. know going die require hospitalization? Like guy mentioned worried dead bills it, loss work, fact idea happens long term lung damage. 

I would think given things, someone really cares body, life wants stay healthy would avoid something shown cause permanent lung damage reduced capacity. It’s stretch; there’s bunch class action lawsuits occurring country.

If stretch said class action suits wouldn’t grounds lawsuit there’s several court currently.

Sweden probably going excess mortality either week next.

This means visiting Sweden, following current levels precautions, going statistically exactly risky every time visited past. difference.

The difference there's new risk, humans consistently *shit* correctly assessing risk, overvalue new unfamiliar risks undervalue familiar risks. (This people afraid flying, perfectly fine driving, even though latter activity 1000x riskier.)

You avoiding driving Sweden next couple weeks afraid dying covid-19 rational avoiding afraid dying traffic accident. fear traffic accidents stopped past, rationally, statistically, fear covid-19 stop now.

Pretty much huge portion Southern California restrictions. like said earlier, state could hit ways, like pull gaming license, liquor license. numbers also assume unlimited contact tracing capabilities cooperation populace assumed.

Neither things reality.

A better metric testing whether people actively seeking testing able get one. believe Arizona may still bit short standard. could people coming non gendered language (English) applying gendered language (Spanish) separating words difference languages, could someone identifies Latinx (a non gendered word) modifies gendered word (woman) indicating separate identities. 

Regardless really us question. words Chris Rock: Grand opening....Grand closing! hope great day, too.

That’s point.

""He think"" exactly science.

It's useful know excess deaths (although already knew that), question caused excess deaths. need start planning response healthcare systems Florida, Georgia, California, Texas start freezing up. logistics handling massive outbreak NYC metro area completely different staging relief less dense states. 

We given warning things going worst case scenario right now- prepared. thousands crappy, low paying, customer facing part time jobs! THOUSANDS!!! understanding reality change it.

California authority sovereign lands california. That's people understand. La county alone huge! can’t compare flu. lot experience dealing that. drugs flu treatment flu vaccine. incentivizes *seeking* work. throw 3 job apps indeed every week never check email really want to. still making roughly $30/hr unemployment moment states including PLUC credits. really agree UBI incentivizes job seeking either amount money recieved woould significantly lower.  Older people cannot completely isolate world, still need taken care and/or need resupply groceries. Hence, people spreading virus means higher chances older people getting it. 

Also, one mains issues virus high R0. Collapsing hospitals means deaths covid, also deaths diseases Always fun games... great day, thanks knowledge. Obviously countries exist too, talking 100 million entire world horrible. time states it'll little, late. Yes pockets high spread, death rate still well average. “I don’t need wear mask I’m sick” basically argument gives millions people chlamydia gonorrhea every year. Deaths hospitalized patients fallen, average hospitalized patient four times less likely die April (see link below), excellent news, potential downside hospitals overload, time around beds slower empty; April hospitalized patients died quickly, survive continue require care, means next patient cannot admitted. scenario pans out, going need massive patient transportation, lose progress made better treatment past months.  takes light questioning make fall apart too. cousin ""I'm sorry friend, name?"" learned well, actually know name deceased, friend told might know either, actually friend-of-a-friend kinda story. even trying tear apart yet, trying decent thing hear death. gonna try tear apart telling let family know inform medicare fraud recover money result get cut recovered (which makes story extra asinine - requires medical professionals greedy they're willing lie death certificates, yet also none greedy enough expose lies huge personal payday).

I'm usually hesitant judge people intelligence based academic performance, lot variables intelligence. completely fits stereotype redneck high-school dropout. Seems like one big places catch virus. Maybe they're thinking older people usually go though that's guess.

Antibody testing NY shows least 10x number cases confirmed testing. ive posted link like 5 weeks now

people told every week numbers spike, projections claimed would spike every week since march, theres thousand articles every week claiming would surges

but ever come close projections, entire time, noticeable jump rates lumped presumed cases code U07.1, april, downhill since then

more cases mean deaths, 90% new cases asymptomatic (a misinterpretation pcr test results, antibodies, immune now), tell you

plus survival rate states 99.98% including old except new york survival rate ventilators 5%, numbers higher rest entire country combined periods..gross mismanagement, banned effective treatment country favor deadly governor demanded it

but lets wait see, bookmark keep referring it, update every week, informative. check every week keeps telling story. keep sharing every week keep hearing handful objections

If:

a) testing maxed out; but

b) guidelines gets tested change; 

than expect positive test rate go up? guess I'm asking would expect tests given higher percentage before, requirements get test changed? Hahahahhahahahha. Thank that.

Final straw.

Ill never buy Tesla. Dipshit going alienate fucking group people vehicles appeal to. lack national coordinated response completely Trumps fault. CDC useless, make things worse, provide support guidance, Trump pitted rather leading cooperative response. 

Each state left figure none states pandemic response training preparation, figured fly. Cuomo made mistakes pretty damn well considering support federal government bid supplies states.  also corrected mistakes soon identified such. 

A pandemic exactly sort event led federally. fed gov expertise needed this. makes sense state figure pandemic response team/plan. job CDC. no, are. Trump even let CDC lead corrupted little tried do. leadership. state own- except banded together help other. What’s difference? Everyone expendable. wow America FUCKED up...it's soooo much better Canada...free universal healthcare, buy insurance, around $40 month person plan...I can't get MUCH shit costs America, guys get bent fucked 8 ways Sunday comes anything medical!!

I'm pretty sure emergency while. what? Post publicly available numbers? Thank suggestions. I’ll best. great question. likely worn masks practice better hygiene, thus motivated get free test.

Yup, logic, likely take EXTRA precaution attending protest days weeks. kind behavioral shift could lead less total net community transmission exact person, exact temperament, gone protest.

Everyone's saying, ""they're taking risk! they're taking risk!"" yes, are, they're taking risk feel worth particular cause. But, considering, might also things mitigate risks, net result mitigation could actually exceed risk took relative alternate scenario neither.

*Everyone* this, almost *none* us going 100% never leaving house anything ever. budget risks week things like visit friend, go store, etc. assuming people going protests still taking risks would otherwise. may instead taking 50% risk day, 100% mitigation afterwards they'd normally do, so, 20%, leading decrease overall transmission. can't 100% time months straight, knew something almost certainly put high risk, probably would willing briefly. Someone takes many smaller risks might apt overcompensate mitigation, might instead become increasingly complacent unconcerned virus. going realized partial closures encourage people go parts state want. Completely defeats purpose! It’s spoon fed...

I've never seen people misspelled poorly before. make mask things laying around house. drug costs 1000$ summary. wonder rare cells (in relation dengue fever) mentioned top megakaryocytes mentioned hearts.

Some organs many rare cells produce platelets. extra platelets cause blood clots. (Dengue fever destroys rare cells hand leads low platelet level bleeding.)

Micro-clots multiple areas brain caused oxygen deprivation. blood clots happen early stage unnoticed (before hospitalization). people need hospitalized need checked micro-blood clots.

Micro-blood clots also found lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, organs. explains multiple organ failure.

So doctors give blood thinners covit patients.

Extra megakaryocytes found hearts. cells produce platelets typically found bone marrow lungs hearts. people downplaying virus nuts. Home construction absolutely essential. buddy roof renovation shutdown started. supposed do, camp waterlogged living room stars since March? People need safe housing expect stay months. haven’t gone since reopened. people really need babied?

Smh one really wants pay good care. DoD VA already eat enough budget. Dirty little secret wealthy. Canada (any nation well) welcome open arms. Many companies rely business model. Uber one. According data, June 23 June 29, Arizona averaged 11,662 tests per day.  

To start mitigating virus, study found Arizona would need test 74,135 people per day. suppression, Arizona would need test 200,000 people per day. actually safely wear cloth mask hours... isn’t reasonable expect follow surgical protocol ppe. don’t want touching mask it’s on. you’re around people know sick, you’re going want better protection anyway.  6/9: 3045

Also pneumonia deaths decreasing well increasing. covid, still decreasing. donate, economic shutdown expected push 150M people towards starvation foreign aid stopping governments lost much tax revenue. never happen, intentionally holding events like criminal act pandemic.

Americans selfish, stupid assholes. leadership certainly is.  $40 month? like $400 month bar clusters: young, reckless men tightly packed indoors. Could alcohol part this, too? know covid hits regions high density hard

It may tend hit first, list places hit hardest per capita US mostly rural areas, plus NYC. hear counting numbers large many people. way while, since least late-April. also know IFR somewhere .3 1% age demographics. people 60 IFR drops .1%.

Correct, best estimates somewhere .5% FLA Georgia huge death numbers started seeing large spikes infection back March April. 

They never huge infection rates, epsecially like now. Moreover, two worst states regarding hiding data. Florida, particular, STILL adding deaths late April/early may, even now. Florida's death reporting lags much 80 days. increased # cases seeing going happen re-opened. 

Agreed. protests obviously contributed that. 

Disagree, data shows otherwise. said would really really surprised see rise death rates states.

You moving goalposts. never arguing increase int eh death rate. arguing going see big increase deaths. Nice try, though.  Magic Johnson got AIDS height epidemic survived.

Testing alone mitigate spread. identifies spread already happened potentially trace came from.

Mitigation comes social distancing effective lock down.

Look, way testing. hospitals, example, asymptomatic screen testing ensure staff COVID positive.

People think colds hear viruses. don’t know possible permanent long term consequences. Many rheumatological conditions thought virus triggers. 

There ton random viruses circulate really serious consequences. friend good health life one day 50s got random unknown virus. doctors thought might gotten someone bus. One day came home work feeling tired. Within hours paralyzed neck ambulance. eventually recovered movement waist ton physical therapy, spent last 10 years life wheelchair. never identified virus people it.

Fellow Texans please call office inquiring Doctor studied infectious diseases less informed him.  office 512-463-0001.  part Texan blow line get answers. Smart decision, long run restaurants adapt takeout/delivery model. means shedding physical presence expensive part town, leasing barebones commercial kitchen, opening hours per day crank orders closing order save labor costs.

Keep mind Wuhan, several months last recorded case, estimated 50% restaurants close. Yes, Kill base, see problem Fauci wrong lot things. He's right that.

But Patrick. Patrick asshat enormous proportions. Isn’t Tesla publicly traded? Unless Enron type shit somewhat accurate. know surprised, fuck much lower people go? Flabbergasted.

Man trying reopen like last week think literally almost day cases spiked everything shut disease started 6 months ago, yet going find peer reviewed studies demonstrating long-term lung damage.

But shows based SARS &amp; MERS history doctors extrapolate similar damage we're seeing expect majority hospitalized patients long-term permanent lung damage  Ha, got 'em. Chess mate. told, straight face, deposited ""great flood"". hock doctrine used good ill, tbh usually used ill sigh. 

Unfortunately.... UK bars Swedes: sure US Swedes rn, Sweden along countries follow EU recommendations bar Americans entering AFAIK. Someone said Oakland good.  Walnut Creek, Lafayette, Concord people gave up. actually planned buy tree sapling, none available area. No. Cares Act (which temporarily making unemployment livable wage) set end July 31. that, unemployment drop $676/wk $93/wk. isn’t going help all.  could argue that, that's point thread. Stay track. Yes. Good analogy Sounds like things great started reading news (obviously) rejoined Reddit. Delete again. logic, must fucking retarded electing Trump whether voted not. Fauci saint putting this.

Working around virus day, fear catching it, fear spreading loved ones, fear losing coworkers. 49% chance precise world population still wrong though.

Admit mistakes. called accountability.

Especially mistakes led death. pay benefits(none) job shitty, good thing follow policy, matter mad customer gets, backed way CEO. healthy quarantine afterwards not?  Smiiiiiize Given size US differences states, makes sense parts would get hit hard later. Heck even state, Kansas City hit lot harder Wichita back March/April. Right feels like things getting started Wichita.

What surprising though part country go pandemic 120k+ deaths states hit hard yet learn anything it. Hopefully Texas, Florida, Arizona, states careful doubt it. Oof yeah sounds awful. think problem page comes awful idea reopen quickly did, specifically reopening places known people socially gathering droves like bars. can't believe denial people protests (especially major cities firm grasp virus) played contributing roll. even try googling asking this?

You chance now, will. Unless bluster run interference, owe humanity educate bogging conversation sealioning.

Then, find something, comment instead sealioning others it, saving time everyone contributing discussion rather hobbling it. masks. Thailand, 65 million people. first country outside China register cases. We've 3000 cases 58 deaths. That's less one death per million people. Everyone (99%) wearing masks since January. Nearby, Vietnam zero deaths. lock down. closed borders. local case 5-6 weeks. Wear damn mask. 100-degree weather, anyone it. “Fake footage! Crisis actors!” people scream. That's putting nicely. Elon Musk crappy. doctor, sounds like might triggering POTS: ...and he's gonna explain deaths, sick people, overwhelmed medical workers, etc. How? overall positive high enough, like 12-14% NC, doesn’t effect diminish substantially? understand there’s 5% false positive rate study shows 3% positive, that’s quite unreliable. people touched this, thought would lay numbers people better reason positive test rate percent actually tells you.

Imagine fake state 1000 people thought experiment playing role god, infect 200 people.

The public health apparatus state jumps action, trying determine many people sick, lack divine insight know real number.

They test one person, comes back positive. 1 test, 1 confirmed case, 100% positivity rate.

What positivity rate actually tell us? tell us 100% population sick, nope, know all-seeing perch case, exactly 200 people infected.

The public health officials think, ""This enough data draw conclusion, let's test people."" test 100 people, random sampling statistics tell us would pretty close 20% positive rate (since reality 20% sick). results come back 24 confirmed cases, 100 tests, 24% positivity rate.

What positivity rate tell us now? likely closer real number, actually know yet, would really want keep increasing testing rate stabilizes.

We could test another random sample 100 people, since statistics changed get back another 21 confirmed cases, that's 45 total 200 tests, doubled number tests positivity rate went 24% 22.5%. positivity rate relatively stable could testing, probably tell us 20% population infected.

The positivity rate should, large enough sample, come match infection rate. positivity rate high, likely means testing, positivity rate low, likely means testing.

If cared accuracy, wanted know exactly many people sick, easiest (but means cheapest) thing would test everyone. would get nice accurate snapshot, would know exactly many people infected not.

Since also care things like, ""not spending money testing"" ""being able process tests"" real world take approach test people suspect could infected. tends skew positivity rate testing people reason think they've exposed, likely infected random sampling.

Dr. Fauci, actual expert diseases instead guy reddit, suggested target states try hit 10% positivity rate. rate, states testing ""enough"" ""accurate enough"" picture many people infected make reasonable policy decisions. Ill leave anyone needs little 10 hour pick up.

- didn’t even create PayPal.. United States built Religion, science...that belief hard change someone thinks COVID Devils work ..
Unfortunately got hope Hell's chance ...lol...oh well.. Totally agree. think folks also ignoring daycares camps little much well. kids’ infection rates may less, touch points greater.

Just happens businesses open, day care usage increases well. Starting? Seems like business usual me. Keep experts around someone blame disregard unless benefits narrative.  i'm unemployed throw party I'm drunk bum drunk friends, someone rich unemployed they're socialite soiree. can't explain that! Absolutely. article talks transferring patients hospitals. Texas like southern states, VAST majority bed capacity cities, means little capacity left. like trying save overflowing bathtub shot glasses. friggin Reddit keep date things nationwide. Regular news sources suck lie

__No country old men__ wish countries willing take Americans point there's blame them, embarrassment point. calling people dumb, help case use poor grammar. *are* many dumb people. NZ great job...but totally unrealistic majority countries states.

And here's move goalpost.

Just admit ok little death get shitty haircut. 0.26% unknown % thereafter ongoing issues. death rate going massive gamble future health. Researchers China studying spread coronavirus outside Hubei province—ground zero pandemic—identified 318 clusters three cases 4 January 11 February, one originated outdoors. study Japan found risk infection indoors almost 19 times higher outdoors.  ...i laughed know cry instead...i live TX. Point taken. apologize. masks layer flannel. They’re hot balls otherwise super comfortable. Buuuut, thought everyone wanted test could get test? thought greatest best beautiful testing world? lied to?  Nooooooooooo. 27 year old overweight? wondering articles I've seen young person dying corona virus say pre-existing issues, article picture see they're like 300 pounds. go kill kill anyone else, plague rat. seriously never heard someone moving area like area whatever reason? could million reasons want leave...who tell valid isn't? 

And despite ridiculous question, I'll answer anyway: No, plenty friends loved ones think great people. also pretty blatantly wrong. compare dashboard states hardly different all. adds like another 2% cases. could also argue double counting appears count antibody regular test.

This sub funny, constant slamming Florida praising her.

Desantis actually right, Florida great data incredibly keep parroting tweets sub partisan can't see bias.  said hard conclude anything numbers 2020 ""provisional"". Fair enough. [Obama Scales Back Goals America Visiting meant coronaviruses, think may correct. I'd stunned absolutely work done SARS virus now. I’m Ohio friend restaurant shut back resuming indoor dining three servers tested positive Covid two three asymptomatic. indoor dining probably good move. favorite tutorial face masks! fabric ties really nice lift mask needed. Also, site lot amazing videos beginners, started learn made zippered pouches, tutorial videos great! People /r/coronavirus always trust gut science comes spread coronavirus. workong completely understand there's alot people going like global pandemic. Going packed beaches, bars, restaurants even bothering social distancing masks etc. unemployment works all. don’t time explain you, get 1/3 1/2(on bad month!) normally make. Trust I’d rather working. Good point. might artifact. Ukraine fiddling testing bring numbers - get EU travel list - could blame them? 

The country population 43 million 1,700 people died / C-19. one lowest mortality rates world. 

So, maybe, maybe Ukrainian government said ""fuck Covid thing - measures destructive virus significant magnitude"". agree everything.

We need shut states cannot without financial help.

And Congress busy planning vacations job. folks make hundreds thousands year think $1,200 stimulus check cover basic necessities like six months. Maricopa county walked 800:square foot store day walked right saw 6 8 people weren’t wearing masks. People don’t care affects them, well could AZ. Chaotic good US 15x larger 50x sets leadership. cherry pick good bad states support either agenda wish. US therefore much harder time restricting freedoms individuals order stunt spread COVID. Chile pandemic? anybody give fuck? No. US, politics important. city, nobody color arrested harassed (by police) wearing masks.

And actually, local grocery store, white people wearing masks, unmasked Hispanics also typically entire family tow - even though signage mask mandate printed English Spanish versions. next unmasked group under-washed, tattooed, over-tanned group people often seen wearing appears 4 seasons worth clothing time. They're probably much hazard though since everybody else seems automatically give social distancing reflex. last group include lot whites, though they're probably 'can't afford mask' category. flhealthchart Florida Health official website.    
The numbers reported Florida CDC website slightly different because, said 2020 provisional. coronavirus shotgun wedding original question DeSantis limiting testing, statement thrown around constantly. Abbot antibody test 99.90% specificity rate 100% sensitivity 17 days symptom onset. 

In words, 1,020 pre-covid samples, 1 turned positive. Also, 17 days symptom onset 125 samples hospitalized PCR confirmed patients turned positive.

It's rapid test requires lab process. believe widely used including either Quest LabCorp. forget.

Paper want wear mask stay fuck home.

150%!!!! wanna wear mask bad STAY HOME. pretty simple. Pretty soon, looks like Texas dead. Sad. Traditionalist docs: ARDS, use protocols!

Kind fucked statement lump everyone together. leaders thing totally get. dang, longest response ive ever received, i'm fat though, but. send receipt makes happier, vegetables average expensive, plus needing time cook, wash etc people work three jobs kids Common sense would've told anyone told everyone wear mask matter low grade would prevent spread. really need study months know this. People looking excuse wear one question it. outbreak follows several state associated bars.

Graduating STEM degree feels like best chance escaping poverty. reported U.S. numbers already bad enough embarrassing insight probable-related excess deaths. got downvoted lmaooooo  let guess, none employees wear mask (like country). telling kids go school year college freshman, example, spend first semester university online. sounds like letting people live lives me.

You sit clearly expert. Correction, sad, indignant, pretentious hag put bandana kids? Oh yes grocery stores bastions safe havens forcing everyone wear masks....Except don’t think actually happening political decisions driven entirely affect re-election prospects.

Don’t think wore mask. obese diabetes medical issues. really sick right now. Hopefully scares relatives (who don’t live high-risk place right now) take seriously. I'm sure even modern mainstream country leans right anymore. mean, love hate him, Luke Bryan huge country star days I've really heard anything from/about indicates he's right wing. favorites like Darius Rucker, Luke Combs, Zac Brown Band, others. Unless they're racist well real dangerous political views, really mind artists listen differing Confederate flags concerts either! 

That's huge win. Honestly, even think many modern mainstream artists like confederate flags concerts. mostly seem parking lots tailgates. tailgating Darius Rucker concert people confederate flags.

Thank you. feel like everyone like that, wouldn’t crisis. cities this. right layout walkable make work.

Not really useful suburbanized cities, use parking lots outdoor seating, sure wants eat asphalt instead picking go. I'm originally Florida school ridiculous see difference two states handling response. People often inside stores masks beaches always packed. cases skyrocketing fantastic position recovery. wish government would learn clearly that's asking much. got reminder deaths still up.

Sun Belt states see go roof too.  weird much want defend foreign policy created millions refugees.

And want talk plays role pandemic risks refugee camps. highly doubt actually testing people don’t symptoms. People getting tested either symptoms, lying them, someone show evidence contrary.

I've trying share similar concerns people hear saying ""don't wear mask"" opposite. whole mask thing people freaking passing jogger OK gather thousands hours chanting. really warped people's risk perception. argument bullshit.

The idea large crowds protesters shoulder shoulder, screaming yelling practicing social distancing whatever group people going days protests going spread virus less population practicing social distancing, wearing masks, behaving cautious manner protesting crowd keep many people home lower infection rate crowds spread it.

If true, social distancing measures mask wearing anything almost stop spread disease tells me. really complete bullshit, constructed fact fit story want tell. Geez almost like test people cases...

If countries amount testing us, results would one actually cares facts science. Dont forget conspiracy theorists hear sunlight good them. bleach injections. prevents ICU filling saves lives. question since don’t know much vaccines (but support vaccinated past) 100% stop risk individual infection? possibility could still get infected, case body prepared fight off? Seems ""restaurant demographic"" referring younger people, coincidentally people protests?

#Sweden defined risk country record high number new infections last week. Experts believe must look far quarantine-free trip across [Norwegian] border.


- Norwegians forget Sweden year. think totally unrealistic able go year. Maybe next year, depends choose do, says former infection control consultant Ullevål, Bjørg Marit Andersen, Børsen.


The death toll neighbor country, peaked 5,300 Monday, makes cold chill go spine Andersen, professor medicine former infection control consultant Ullevål hospital Oslo.

#- Exceptionally high

From Monday Friday last week, high 9 094 new cases infection registered, Monday authorities reported another 2 350 new cases weekend. means 11,400 Swedes detected virus last week. Confirmed cases infection thus 67,667.

- number Sweden now, number infections number dead, unusually high. quite unexpected things would go ""crazy"" upstanding society, says Andersen.

- let infection spread without lockdown without proper action, may take year two start see complete control it. infection spread Sweden countries.

- AWFUL: Professor former infection prevention consultant Ullevål Hospital, Bjørg Marit Andersen, thinks figures Sweden tragic read. 
 

#- Many going die

The Swedes' handling led country kept many Europe gradually reopening. Swedish Minister Justice, Ann Linde, believes Nordic countries' treatment Swedes lead deep neighborly wounds take long time heal, Swedish trade industry despairs need Norwegians.


#MUST VACCINE PLACE: opinion Jörn Klein, associate professor University Southeast Norway expert microbiology infection control. 

Jörn Klein, associate professor University Southeast Norway expert microbiology infection control, also thinks long Norwegians visit Sweden again.

**""From purely professional perspective, mean vaccine place,"" tells Børsen.**

Although Swedish authorities tightened somewhat, Swedish authorities continue report double triple deaths daily, country France US list corona deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.

- think terribly tragic. many infections, also know many going die, says Andersen.
#On worst list

After last week placed Sweden worst list terms number new cases infection, put country box Moldova Albania, among others, state epidemiologist brain behind Sweden's strategy, Anders Tegnell, went WHO.

- increasing number infected people Sweden, testing before. unfortunate people confuse Sweden countries problems whatsoever obviously beginning epidemic, ”Anders Tegnell told Swedish SVT . Maybe it’s masks recommended retirement homes? wAnT gRaNcHiLdRen Thank you, guess Americans fucked...I want live damn near anywhere America Don’t tell r/ForcedVaccine lol fault? Please explain. family members? think it’s time burn bridges. virus made realize lot stupid acquaintances  interesting information! Thank sharing experience. think phase 1. Blame Chinese going since least March. Tbf, Denmark opened gyms weeks ago, havent seen increase cases. Distancing cleaning equipment use, seems sufficient. getting info? virus spread long still people spread mitigation efforts. evidence ""burns out."" Nobody's blaming three year olds ffs...even 12 year olds know...we're talking ""young adults"" apparent mentally three year olds. course ever brilliant ""MuH fREeDUmb"" asshats. Yes, leaders failed sure, cool, blame anyone else self responsibility. NYC contact tracers, two weeks ago, allowed directly ask protest could question generally provide info? makes sense. Poverty absolutely factor - find ripping low-income areas US, too. point mere *density* seem be. Early on, thought would be, outbreaks dense cities appear uncontrollable like people initially feared. guy needed discipline child *Coronavirus liked this* POTUS still won’t wear mask loyal followers eat up.

We need federal mask mandate federal testing initiative. yeah that's fair, make sound like US big outlier reality group 5-15 similarly affected countries also believe earth flat Poverty correlates inversely deaths, main variable urbanization. know lots people covid, lots people REddit mentioned Covid.

None weird permanent effects article says common. Nope! don’t follow social media. Care post links meme posting? say restaurant server? would like understand context. what's puzzling nature game Necause there’s tear beer Im crying you, dear? like data family members. gather anecdotal evidence report back asap.

That’s main thing here. misinformation gotta say wonder whose family pushing wedding stood gain things went bad (to obviously worst case). basically fuck everyone compromised immune system, long fine. like Covid deniers more, least stupid...he's stupid selfish well. guess that's ""benefit"" grandson someone flee Holocaust. renounce current citizenship. It’s weird people wouldn’t agree giving unemployed people extra $600 week worse forcing people go back work unsafe situations leaving unemployed people unable pay rent bills. What’s wrong people?!? Phase One: Hide numbers

Phase Two: .....

Phase Three: Profit! Lives one hand red votes other. Tragic lives aren’t first easy choice many zombie cult leaders. wish have. grew tired childish behavior thread, I'm anxious repeat here. least German officials locked Tönnies meat processing factory near Gütersloh outbreak occurred. contrary, Trump signed executive order Defense Production Act compel meat processing plants remain open least 20 meatpacking food processing workers died. really tells human rights condition US. join you?

Phase 3 profiting tourists, million dollar medical bills people dying know coronavirus bad is. Haha he'd better watch understand much PR affect sales. Tesla luxury brand nerdy left coast types. truth one needs Tesla. status symbol really amazing high end vehicle. 

If acts like lil b, Tesla could become douchey brand one wants associated with, fast. like Amazon kind know evil top basically monopoly. 

He trying punish people believe virus, see mask wearing general compliance. California deals horrible outbreak going come looking good side. Darwin enters chat think solvable government, naive. Joe would make masks mandatory rest term. fun that. mean won’t listen random redditors anecdote? guess get rid peer review process then! wait, people state dying? Maybe real... right thing, right thing often negative consequences due ignorant people around you. Illinois Michigan cancelled person visits non-emergency care. can't get vaccination prostate exam via telemedicine. Well done. please conclude wearing masks make difference? No

Phase 5: ???

*Phase 6:* Profit! «No shaking hands»
Berset praises population dealing crisis. ""It go like this: keep distance, hand hygiene shaking hands,"" emphasizes. ""This important situation - even summer.""

Second wave
""The goal cantons prevent second wave,"" says Alain Berset.

quarantine
For people returning corona risk areas, 10-day quarantine ordered, according Alain Berset.

No patchwork
So far, Switzerland exception requirement masks, says Berset. contrast countries, wearing mask recommended. increasing number cases would persuaded Federal Council wear mask. ""This seems reasonable us current situation."" national obligation also prevents regional cantonal patchwork.

«Virus still there»
Health Minister Alain Berset comments detail decisions. increasing number positive cases recorded connection easing. «The virus still there. careful. »

Tourist traffic increasing number
The reason mask requirement increasing travel traffic increasing number new infections since mid-June, Sommaruga explains.

Uniform regulation
Public transport wanted uniform regulation Switzerland, said Sommaruga. ""With obligation wear mask, protect fellow human beings."" could mean counties like Miami Dad, Broward Palm Beach could worse numbers......

fucking great. Fair question.

Though simply moderating here, saw debate breakdown occur, believe would take series documented quotes, audio, video, proof statement Surgeon General, Dr, Fauci, etc., spent months unequivocally saying masks nothing people don’t need them

Showing statements (unequivocally: masks nothing) repeatedly made timeline given (months) entities given (Surgeon General, Dr. Fauci). really different proving assertion, apply advice generally. make bold assertion, show evidence. That's works. Otherwise, seem bloviating.

Now, happen paying lot attention past months, personally. pretty close certain evidence claim cannot found. Hence telling issue defending hyperbolic statement. (in likelihood) simply true, therefore, defending puts one impossible situation.

A less hyperbolic statement could actually backed would Fauci sources downplaying need PPE scenarios past months.

This could find evidence for. likely, anybody familiar current events ask it. Difficult say now, heard well Russia never downplayed single thing lol. prepared saw happening rest Europe unlike US. mortality rate low Russia actually count correctly autopsies every single deceased. example someone Cancer get infected, Covid worsens they'll die covid. Surprisingly even free healthcare underdeveloped regime unlike advanced country :) thought India really harsh well. really is. many reports months back thought reinfections actually virus still present body active. Lots came Korea months ago it. job gone, company eliminated position permanently, go back work? first thought soon read “absolute best data” It’s lovely sentiment, maybe best idea pandemic still raging spots around world country even noticed recent uptick? Good luck, guys. thank rioters protsters Amazon pay tax. carry-forward losses write off, taxed every corporation is. Pay price county?! studies (I gave links comments up) show areas protested correlated outbreaks. opening things like bars are, however. 

Being outside wearing masks makes big difference. Meh. hardly effective. people keep crazy ideas vicinity would listen. Now, broadcast anywhere influence crazy future crazy people. Ahhh okay. know, released statement us need complain. Though someone pointed Arizona governor Ducey used CEO story local paper people yelling highschool aged kids working ice cream shop summer job. Swearing calling sheep. Unreal article say much cost?  Maybe they’re free ticket purchase. talking long term effects. haven’t cited anting long term effects. 

CDC’s IFR c19 0.26%. says virus 10-25 times prevalent known cases, meaning 10-25 times less lethal previously thought. Meaning 25-50 million people already disease. Meaning 10% friends (if you’re American) already it. many complaining long term effects keep taking about?

I agree trust CDC. Good idea. stop shooting leg adopt masks like Asians do. Bssically everyone public. I'm optimistic people start taking shit seriously again

Lol oh yea, minute now. Americans snap start taking threats like seriously. 

I’m also optimistic take care climate change we’re 😂 Rinse repeat. People keep hyping ""neurological damage"" claim well. virus may well directly attack neurological system cases, getting enough oxygen weeks time definitely cause neurological damage. Trying delineate two effects simple. fellow Doctor Richard! :O Sounds right. Fuck you, pay can’t sue put danger 

America needs serious overhaul many levels isn’t even funny Ohio bit shit lol. Illinois know fleeing issue since taxes insane. Indiana paradise, it’s probable. people get virus home. Closing businesses net worse result number people actually saved net good result. cannot control everything people still get it. reason punish businesses non-existence process. think know bit disease even though cure, found ways try reduce mortality rates. Hopefully good sign 53000 deaths per year air pollution caused motor vehicles miles driven per year US deaths per mile driven

Let's say Tesla lasts average 250,000 miles. Tesla saves 0.00411 people death.

Tesla's Fremont factory outputs 34000 vehicles per month. Let's say Tesla lasts 10 years.

34000\*0.00411 = 139.74 lives saved per month.

10,000 people work Tesla factory. 139 could keeling every month Tesla would still ""in green."" Would acceptable people? Obviously not, again, happening going happen. Now, say, ""but that's rough estimate! effect?"" Keep mind, counting:

1. fact Teslas around 4 times safer terms accident rates average dinosaur burner.
2. effects climate change.
3. fact Tesla exponentially growing, means profit car produced invested accelerating transition green energy. So, take 140+ people multiply factor greater one.

Further, factory environment people taking reasonable precautions spread particularly dangerous.

Plus, majority workers Tesla factory likely be:

1. Young
2. Living alone living young people bay area sure, Trump said would maybe disappear one expects US death rate return height 6 percent (now shy 5 percent) - likely get (mostly) agreed upon average 1 2 percent.  


Deaths rise b/c sheer number infected. mean expect numbers go back 2500 day. 🤔 people pro mask inherently intellectually dishonest. don’t want conversation anything 3 word slogans enforce agenda. better try say words actually imply desire conversation masks rather repeating promask slogans other. Well I'm expert 🔨 us. U wear mask protect others.

Now u think virus nose slime: sticks mask smears back nose face. stays mostly mask. YES u getting u.

But u sleep u smear everywhere also. Sounds like called Pathos School Fieldhouse. I've got feeling NY, early days, testing scarce things chaotic deaths probably recorded new cases days lot cases... People dying homes undiagnosed, coming hospital extremely sick dying shortly after. Stuff like that.

Now testing available enough probably know COVID many cases weeks die. got whole season dude. picked spread begin with.

Edit: that's American futbol. countries gotten handle virus. American sports exceptional citizens. yes back maybe even ten years ago brief thing women soaking tampons alcohol believe seal bunch random people together flying aerosol can.

Should fine, puncture incinerate. Drivers shouldn’t enforce. report passenger gets auto banned. US BAD EVERYWHERE ELSE BETTER Suggestion: see Idiocracy. yet Ohio Open almost 6 weeks way less hospitalizations peak. Almost 50% reduction. testing = cases hospitalizations deaths numbers need followed watched. Ohio example anyone tested free testing time high. friends neighbors need stay home travel. Wear mask, clean hands, spread out, nothing mentioned hard. 

Every Texan know talks fondly state, want bail going gets tough? low chances :) well cancerous comment I've seen long time! trying quantify privilege vs putting human lives risk. show protest better tear gas Wouldn’t wanna double economy spending $100 there... Show source says asymptomatic people organ damage. Sub clinical changes seen ct scans, sub clinical means disease severe enough present observable symptoms. Fear mongering bullshit Here's thought. Eat home. I'm fan order shit half measure, folks still allowed go church though? still mandated mask order instead leaving local leaders require not.
It close unless essential. Go back takeout ordering restaurants. me. Got sick end February mid March. Worst day March 12th. short breath felt like belt tightened around chest. Unfortunately support home seek medical attention. 

My spouse thought dramatic something. told drive hospital needed go. weak drive. Sweats, chills, red eyes, exhaustion, total loss sense smell taste, muscle aches, blood pressure went roof I've never high blood pressure. 

My doctor told start recording blood pressure readings twice daily take baby aspirin 1x day. Tests impossible get outside inpatient hospital setting. March 12th dug albuterol inhaler took benzo laid taking tiny gasps air thinking might wake up. 


Got better. worse better! felt good throughout May half June. Symptoms returned last week. Tested active COVID-19 negative last week negative. virus created vascular cardiovascular problems me. surgery deal damaged vein last week. 

I want belong club. Absolutely pathetic elected leader kinda, sorta right thing makes news cycle.

This America. masks going save TX, CA, FL AZ. hit exponential growth governor's shut till people begging hospitals run bc want admit wrong. “may” $11 prevents dying? wish detailed information risks outdoors. Seems sunshine (UV light) breeze (dries disperses droplets) helps lot. Combined mask wearing likely significantly safer indoors. explain seeing strong correlation protest locations new cases. Closing beaches pools may actually bad idea alternative people congregate indoors. Yeah gotten real sick Christmas eve Christmas day week prior kept feeling like something lungs like flem felt like never coming out. went ER diagnosed Bronchitis history child. would died coronavirus? Agreed, that's actually think distinction important. Without knowing I'd argue that's states, California especially, actually purple break demographics. ""blue"" ""red"" state like 55:45 100:0 behavior citizens going representative ""the state"" (in governmental/majority sense). analyzed demographics spread California might well actually go point far politics concerned. That’s racist, I’m seeking better life transafrican otherkin family. believe transafrican otherkin families deserve better life? No, qualified opinion scientist studied matter intensively cannot dismissed random turd reddit saying ""it's science"". comparison?  group middle schools kids stands better chance accidentally better better current administration. would probably listen scientists first place. Whining zipper accidents would likely even. It’s still peak everywhere long people travel. Also, *their doesn’t. need faith. Faith many levels higher science. Duh. find detailed overview current situation Texas. Currently test positivity rate 13.56%, way much troubling, since increasing.

Perfect! 
So information, difference 3 Wednesdays listed is...they're testing more? 
the shit could hitting fan 3 weeks ago. hospitals increasing. 
Can anyone else explain flaw logic? 

Edit:

Went grab food everyone working face shields masks. mask. kid front assume picking pies mom mask. people newly reopened dining area? couples 80+ sitting super close one another masks social distancing whatsoever. Motherfuckers death wish. Don’t think they’re testing much, likely people clear symptoms. They’ve 5,000 new cases past 24 hours means tested 10,000-11,000. They’ve also 600-900 deaths every day past month so. Can’t imagine bad really there.  hits clusters small towns cities. scythe seniors home, church crowd getting together protest.

The low death numbers younger people FATALITY stats. means 1% 30 year olds 200 hundred infected people bar 2 die. Many others become sick permanently lose lung function, neural damage, etc.

Wear mask. Social distance number carriers drop longer amount time maintain it. Also joke ZERO evidence get outside high humidity summer environment. fact plenty science saying opposite. save October. ya wanna told ya so, what's prediction NFL. Ends month? Almost like Italy country 60 million people.

While Arizona state 7.3 million people.

So 10 times AZ's numbers, actually higher death rate Italy had.

All AZ 4854 people die match Italy's death rate. People go bars next county over. would say order means need wear mask covering crowded trail went ignored. can’t serious? Please say serious. Fair enough... heart set Summer 2021. want depressed, look public gathering Florida. Hardly anyone wearing mask anywhere. Absolutely ridiculous.  guys outside taste \*insane\* gotten. Trump support cult through. amount people see begging amazes completely! You’re thinking wrong. ONE restaurant open ONE day less dangerous massive protest. that’s what’s happening. 

EVERY bar restaurant open. them, serve many people showed large protest (or more). THEY’RE OPEN EVERY SINGLE DAY. There's also reason expect would get killed counterfeit $20 bill.

The probable bias reporting fairly obvious given topic community relationship authority real perceived.

Plus one actually organized study, go numbers we've got.

There difference theory practice theory, practice -- remember source quote. take weeks paperwork catch patient dies, lag time quite long numbers increase. Hmm, maybe there's something wrong one persons opinion governing 300 million. don’t understand even true. density high, public transport packed, effectively distancing. mask wearing , everyone often worn incorrectly (eg nose out). can’t believe achieved Totally, skeptic thinks matter time start snatching us protests don’t stop. We’ve really upset racists time. ever try justify reduction testing never comment it? believe backdating recording onset symptoms, least date testing.

That helps scientists understand outbreak. number really matters person initially gets sick, tells likely got infected. tells scientists policies worked ones not.

I personally like way Colorado reporting report date symptom onset date. You’re piece shit. Agreed. beach? People still park somewhere else? Bob Pogo? Tennessee? I’m generally ignorant what’s going there. breaking records too? Can’t keep surging states Bringing cancel culture Uber, classy.

Idiots absolutely feel need travel pandemic can't go overseas. short, people make bad choices gravitate Vegas government encouraging it. Vegas screwed. Man, love Costco. enforce mask wearing amazing. death then. whoever make metric fuck ton money.

Also, probably Nobel prizes? feel like creating vaccine record time help save modern world global pandemic probably worth Nobel. Yeah, okay... small business owner goes bankrupt pandemic gets sympathy. suing remain open many stories super spreading occuring opening bars? That's selfish. small businesses trying re-open, bars difficult. patrons drunk. saying judgemental way. get good buzz go bar.

Your impatience doesn’t matter. virus dictate relative normal resumes. feel attacked. too? kind bombastic imo Remember feds going people hoarding face masks? guess it’s medicine, it’s ok though. forget include dead 'critics' column. hate movie. Unclear meant cynically 100% fact. Unless willing part, wearing mask, supporting virus.

Meanwhile, Orange County 779 new cases today positive rate 9.9%.

For reference, similar total population, OC one-third geographic size.

Curious mention San Diego, they're CDPH guideline 8% guideline 5%. time Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years too! got 1/4 million. OK. I've heard national problem, though. Oh horror wanting get sick b/c job. dare express concern! Phase Three: one could seen coming think can't happen there


There something uniquely american happening, sort misinformation laziness happen anywhere careful society.

It may seem like ridiculous carelessness bunch seemingly small ""what's worst happen?"" Choices, thoughtlessness. virus serious, let us cautionary tale that. settle notion ""it happen here"" can.

Good luck stay safe. laws rules such. Unless mandatory, people it. 

And even people try comply. Obesity negates youth. keep taking virus seriously folks took diet exercise. China, Germany, Taiwan India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, US biggest. supplies different countries. responding pandemic.

And reopened, share US manufactured PPE non-essential employers.

So entities demanding suppliers.

The end result start get creative end knock PPE. People selling things hospital grade selling hospital grade. never stuff could penalized for, like drinking underage faking ID

to clear, equating sneaking nightclubs get drunk knowingly spreading disease others? 

but ok...  

The fact things ""illegal"" never stopped anyone committing crime, right? also saying since laws stop 100% crimes, laws?

The world black white, ok? people safe / sensible / sociable thing NEED laws / punishments all, right? good thing, definitely it. People get real callous folks paychecks lot zeros them. principle whether making 1 mil 50k - people can't afford lose paycheck employers withholding pay without providing adequate safety measures realizing that's possible compensating workers accordingly. fun guess articles might say.

At point wants create biggest mess possible new government January. way, he's still winning eyes Goddamnit hell. I've predicting shit months hate right. gonna get point absolutely option shutdown. half-assed measures work seeing repercussions policy. SHUTDOWN NOW!!! wish lots luck thinks able enforce whatever trying enforce  China much #1 might think. Thanks, pretty terrible memory generally go feels vaguely correct. googled double check. Eat rich. Except government give people enough money people facing evictions food shortages.

The government corporations demanding average american decide contracting serious disease potential homelessness/starvation.

I'm going say average person protesting stay home order good reason they're doing, but, certain point, people choice. government give relief need it, they're going demand able go back work make money die, even means might contract disease may kill them.

I see lot people shifting abject failure US government onto average citizen left without relief protection pandemic government failed contain. actually i’d use. shock bags thing. 

No pool now. Upgraded ocean.  death rate gone down, up, anything. Let’s assume worst case though 1% (very generous)

Back 3,000 deaths per day means 300,000 cases per day going on

If we’re 100,000 cases per day now, means dropped dramatically. 

The number gone literally we’re testing more. Anyone turning political that, speaking ass. Thank fostering!  I'm CASA allowed physical contact foster kids.

Court hearings virtual right now, that's good. zoom adoption one foster kiddos!

 hardest kids. work third party layers applications top emr help improve care. contract every system state. Yay economic model begins “Cap” hard inconvenienced

You jumped conclusion. original poster asked forbidden discuss actual statistics, posted chart death rates. wore mask today shopping food. I’m think am. I’m lunatic right wing nut job. I’m guy willing discuss raw statistics death rates frustrated long particular pandemic thought processes friends infectious?

My chart completely unrelated current pandemic, created maybe 3 5 years ago data probably tiny bit recent years.

Over years people make argument isn’t PURELY statistics, like did. “It different gun reach kill others, vs random thing like heart disease.” “we try harder cure cancer restrict pool ownership statistics aren’t important”.  trying rationalize emotions people don’t correlate actual statistics. well known biases - people willing take much greater risks FEEL control. willing drive everyday fear flying. well known flaw human brain, impossible people overcome. [http://www.realstoryofrisk.com/](http://www.realstoryofrisk.com/) also well established NEW RISKS push every rational thought people’s heads. Psychologists written papers years.

Some subtle - fear shark attacks amazingly rare avoidable going ocean, fear heart disease kill political affiliations selfishness failing

I’m entirely non-political, several opinions I’m willing state openly. First all, next time happens, would suggest establish death rate give government right lock everything down, government right. care exact number is, decide calmly. far tell, people would accept “risk” 0.1% IFR (infected fatality rate) worthy shutting economy destroying people’s life savings family run businesses took lifetime build, causing suicides starvation avoid virus - annual flu risk always lived calmly. around 5% IFR possibly vast majority people total agreement give government full control shut everything forever, martial law, shoot anybody beach street reason. Somewhere cutoff doesn’t happen randomly next time know lockdown ends.

Personally, take calculated risks life. example, drive motorcycle sometimes fun, even going anywhere important, circles. :-) people don’t find risk worth taking respect that. smoke couple cigars year, usually one birthday drinking scotch. people think disgusting worth it, like wife. :-) try harm others motorcycle driving smoking, accept risk others non-zero. means accept living free society. risks every last life worth sacrificing fun forever preserve. 

The decision government step based cold statistics, well know flaws human brains scientists warn us about. Wake 2077, that's bombs fall... judging spelling grammar...you tell average Redditor educated average American. average American spend lot time websites text main form communication. They're images videos. Looks like we're gonna die. guess good time pick heroin back up.

This sub f@cking depressing. 

Dr Seuss qualified dispense medical advice Fauci. Well broad spectrum antiviral. could lot applications it. said, never pill. delivered IV. means it'll ever used serious viruses therapy exists for. thinking perhaps dengue fever. Fuck guy agree I'm bar business going awful unless governor finally wakes reality. gonna store next hydrocholorquine? Plus western countries looking somewhat control now. Less market richer countries mean. wrong? 
The flu likely kill teens young adults (below 30) SARS-COV2. agree everything said. dont think getting mad bar owners answer. literally want actual martyrs. Sacrificing everyone else. feel issue sueing. court make right decision keep closed. memory pretty bad, chronic pain... could right. fair, many reasons people wear masks. Take look graph Pic thread. See EU graph? happening even though mask use rare EU. way Europe handled virus day one, means today, wearing mask critical. Countries nobody wears masks never worn still manage control virus.

When demonizing everyone wearing mask times, makes sense all. judging people sake judging TMC Houston currently hospitalized Covid patients entire state Georgia.  Mortality continues merry way down, perfect asymptotic curve. could hardly come smoother data (besides regular Sunday-Monday dips) tried. 18 days since cases started surging. Median time test positive death (or was) 12 days. Yet government see need keep unemployment benefits going? People leave homes quietly time evict starve can't afford food. add police forces giving up.

We might well third world country point, except richest people planet citizens. 1. COVID shown repeatedly less chance spread outdoors.

2. COVID weak UV light.

Even unmasked events Land Ozarks pool party, open beaches, even ReOpen protests, none events caused outbreaks, especially ones like we're seeing currently. still find hard believe, also look outbreak events countries actually contact trace. find, part, events occurred places indoors people congregated close quarters.

It seems people misinterpret protests causing huge outbreaks one catching COVID protests all, terribly illogical. long virus exists population, cases there, that's something we'll accept there's decent treatment vaccine. accept people engaging otherwise avoidable activities proven cause huge outbreaks, like masses people dining indoors drinking indoors. really dont care virus news China, unless developed tested safe effective vaccine anything risk underblown. Already US given zero national strategy pathetic response far. 

Do believe nonsense lockdown hurting economy richest country world done nothing help people affected? almost every country much more, giving hundreds billions elite stealing poor. Hell, Trump stopped weekly golf trips that'd save enough money millions patients.

And need lockdown bloody govt tells everyone wear mask people stupid actually basic common sense. guess what, govt denied even real. really sure, I've always pay pocket avoid getting owing money. get call almost twice week letters bill. I've asked charging one responded said cover waiting room costs. I'd told help pay PPE, would paid heartbeat. Hell, would made extra donation that. friends work hospitals trust me, ever see dime that. fair, charge best track record.

It would kind like saying, "" oh yeah, makes sense Russian doctors keep falling windows."" 

Not saying covid conspiracy, though message gets kind lost politics sometimes, maybe we're prone pitfalls come practicing critical thinking. people die.. think money lost funeral industry. want inheritance sooner rather later. mention social security savings. Thanks clarification, idea actually meant. right, [six degrees /u/JusticeRings talking fact [Six Degrees Kevin DAE remember DeSantis bragged Florida’s then-low Coronavirus numbers, chewed media making look bad? month data available. data transparent. fact, Dr. Birx talked multiple times Florida absolute best data. insinuation otherwise typical partisan narrative trying spun. part reason got lot people profession wax poetically weeks weeks Florida going like New York. Wait two weeks. Florida’s going next. like Italy, wait two weeks. Well, hell we’re eight weeks away that. hasn’t happened. lower death rate, well, way lower deaths generally, lower death rate Acela corridor, DC, everyone there. lower rate death rate Midwest, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, even region, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida lower death rate. number one landing spot tens thousands people leaving number one hot zone world come state. Right on! I’m merely pointing projecting mindset familial closeness others assuming it’s everyone.

His experience feelings distant relatives != others, can’t assume everyone exactly like regard ""We're really going lock guys start wearing mask tee hee hee...no stop, stop it""

That's headline came across I’m glad I’m one thought Ron looking bit...pudgy lately. I'm ashamed live ga highly doubt hiking behavior driving growth cases. super unlikely.

Most current evidence points transmissions mainly occurring people talking within close proximity enclosed spaces extended periods time. 

Breathing briefly pass someone trail outside basically opposite that. (Other live long term windowless bathroom middle apartment.)

Socializing problem, hiking. understand frustration science science, politics. I'm sorry lose livelihood business, first, last. Entrepreneurs usually always bounce back...dead people don't.... stats jibe reality. media friend.

So saying doctors, coroners, epidemiologists, health experts across country ***all*** lying you? they're perfectly coordinated manner.

Why would that? Honestly, want see response: think lying you? Man, I’ve smoking weed decades I’m perfect health. Weed good dudes! theyre gonna lock til deaths taper off, reopen start over? 

stop n start system got going virus...... yeah like FL TX South post corona blue avoiding red travels hopefully americans realize terrible job containing doubt, americans dumb. disagree. think American media, extension social media, polarized people extremes. Trump plays this. scientific question mask efficacy deeply divicive political associations come along left sees right dangerous, uncaring, foolish anti science right sees left gullible sheep following blindly along establishment sources (including scientists like Fouci trusted). 

The mask, lack mask, way quickly assess tribe put assumptions. It’s hard believe wasn’t spread protests... Everything learned spreading infection lot tight gatherings protests had... You’re one claiming spike 2 weeks ago. evidence? It’s pleasant, tolerable. nurse nice counted 15 twisted swab. eye water side swab. You’re giving Government much credit. There’s leaders local, state, federal levels somewhere failing encourage people act correctly, actively encouraging act incorrectly way confidence american population deserves. Hope never find dont surprised pass million deaths massive part population doesnt care. dont care yet numbers people dont see much isnt going change fun. one Obama's drone strikes. It’s passed.  Walnut Creek, Lafayette, Concord nearby - people completely given up. worst people wearing masks hanging neighbors, kids playing together time now. sympathize people (and bored/unhappy kids) spread virus lot. probably also spread lot workplaces business careful.  good hear Oakland people careful still. Lafayette people mostly given up. little Waffle House, treat hope willing learn going try explain wrong HIV comparisons, PhD Immunology expert antigen presentation paper discussing.

HIV leads acquired immunodeficiency (AIDs) direct infection killing one major immune effector cells cells. Specifically kills CD4 ""helper"" cells essential generating responses types infections inducing antibody response B cells major immune effector cell. data NYT article talking discussing direct killing cells like HIV talking aberrant migration cells improper areas. different cells killed also still develop normally clearing infection (they mention harder older people true thymus shrinks age that's cells develop). point made Dr. June article happens different ways viral infections. cells get widely activated migrate, look infected people right get virus may look immunodepleted certain areas bounce back infection clears.

As bioarchives article comment, mention HIV completely different context. talking SARS-COV2 may mechanisms downregulating MHCI (the molecule killer cells recognize kill infected cells). method evading immune response (though ways counteracting NK cells kill cells lacking MHCI). HIV protein called Nef performs similar function helps avoid immune response. lead immunosuppressive activity directly, may help virus survive longer body. ORF8 SARS-COV2 data currently well works also equivalent protein original SARS lost evolved (and evidence may happening again) may useful virus.

Lastly would like say neither articles say anything virus latent body like HIV, currently evidence big differences reactivation long infections seen anecdotal reports true viral latency.

So please, try study little spreading around truth   Trump promise COVID-19 would gone May, April, due heat something? that's really matters imo imagine worrying anti-vaxxers year 2020, pandemic... No, it’s big deal. Keep mind many steroid weren’t going save likely die pneumonia something similar next couple years life anyway. Trump, himself, said publicly wear mask. So, there's way would ever PSA like that. person doctors appointment joked doctor people start carrying broom sticks enforce distancing actually said going bring staff meeting help measure distances waiting rooms! Strange times.

I saw thread similar topic. Worth following, even know enough consequences another People rise Make America Glorious youngens call US version 2.0 “Could” NJ added 1854 probable deaths count. shown deaths graph last week? perfect world yes  US, fuck system. None cities close Houston's 60k ppl protest. Shoot, even hit 10k. even NYC. Funny, made argument 3 months ago wash downvotes, alas! common sense back me, Goldman Sachs. deaths important track highlight...but think it""s vital shed light prolonged side effects covid...especially since lot younger people starting get think since can't die it'll fine.

Ah kidding....they still give shit. No, plan lockdown get cases low enough level could control outbreak using masks, testing, contact tracing.

Most counties could easily none weeks ago. NY, worst hit, would needed longest lockdown ending now.

But instead rushed openings without proper plans place - right back square one wasting 6 week lockdown two trillion dollars.

We know close maximum economic impact close maximum health impact. International business travel shut 18 months. Restaurants, bars, gyms, casinos retail serious trouble. Commercial real estate near bubble. Disaster. Cannibalism 40,000 county, 70,000 state. heartbreaking see us get point. safe im glad count government right now. license plates Thank goodness he’s moron 130,122* lockdown shutdown
 
Seriously. many ways lax we're got going NY we're midst phased re-opening. almost cases town.

There's fucking way you--or anyone--can say definitively dolts like still understand meaning *asymptomatic* largely hopeless. Moreover, really trying make edgy March-type arguments now? complete r/cringe. Congratulations? That’s self-contradiction wrong. Well done. thought crossed mind developed vaccine long time ago?

There also major hospitals available beds, period. Particularly Orlando. Deaths USA continue go rate death (deaths percent population) [is continues substantially lower I’m Texas, I’m down. feel like I’ve lost hope. Coronavirus everywhere. work, certain departments closed others aren’t told (but it’s pretty obvious why). Typical fast food places closed may picked quick lunch drive thru “deep cleaning.” Stores truly enforcing masks they’re scared repercussions (typically boomers walking mask). I’m tired... Another reason Chinese military real need vaccines, undertake disaster relief efforts

In China, it’s tradition PLA soldiers go front line major disasters, earthquakes,floods etc.

In new outbreak, military personnel deployed control order market, exposed group besides doctors (the CDC confirmed April 20 vaccinate doctors special circumstances, need implement outbreak better controlled)

most Chinese residents feel safer PLA soldiers dispatched local area. United States missing key message. get overpriced vitamins shitty advice? Literally press release foreign owned company. Vietnam War lasted shy *twenty* years.  Resident Harris county, TX here, we're 5k daily cases now. Thankfully everyone wearing mask public, still feel staggering minority people abide social distancing measures. We'll see plays out, scared city. GNC almost broken. economy, held duct tape right going fucking CRASH, bottom out, zero out, whatever want call it. 

That $600 week bandaid gaping wound known “economy” goes, jobs had....... 2nd Great Depression begins. Lol, I’ll take word it. wife, OTOH... wondering case. we’ve seeing news pictures sure media reporting would make difference even events reported local/closer. Seems like lot folks don’t get unless it’s something experience first hand. Yes, definition “better” less innocent people dying. don’t really care much much Abbott courts people like whine it. 

If Abbott wasn’t shitty leader wouldn’t even considering are.

Also “people follow illegal orders authoritarian practices” already describes police departments US. Firing cops gutting police unions would probably make less corrupt, more. I'm happy there, visited south island local years back beautiful place I've ever been. Great people, amazing food, glorious roads mountains, beautiful hidden beaches, fantastic place visit. fear too... means going take forever. actually fear plan Ducey. Hit hospital capacity, fall back, repeat. deaths don’t skyrocket huge influx cases, could also see using cause reopen everything 100% go it’s flu route. hope I’m wrong, hope deaths don’t drastically increase... think govt officials blinded death numbers they’re even figuring possible long term complications. beat Covid would bragging hourly Average savings solvency middle class lower Americans declined last decades rich grown far far richer.

It upto people elect govt serves interests instead single issue voters believing lies. Omg. House parties CROWDED. can’t possibly open universities. There’s way. We’ll hundreds new vectors party, night.

Edit: words [I maaaaybe see one person without Need medical card done virtual via zoom meeting. 

You go application delivered grass within days (you get temporary card even). Saving money extreme left stance! Obviously, that's different article Covid-19 specifically. also assuming focusing conspiracies. ""essential"" I've heard many things. lot CT people I've encountered anti-vax/germs make stronger people want use sanitizer masks reason. might run dystopian sci-fi 'this manmade virus' narrative ones probably little paranoid. 

Now here's think article might talking about. People stayed home 'forced' 'forced' rebelled. combination two things. one group, like telling child can't something, makes want act more. number two think BIG ONE terms CT's US. Somebody constantly scaring idea martial law.

A Good Read. shitty journalism guardian clear, city council, mob angry voters, voted unanimously rescind executive order. disagree particular decision, agree city councils power overturn mayoral executive orders. Natural selection  Um going work going fucking die. Oh no, we're definitely laughing. guys water numbers much want.
But Americans arrogant.
When 10k dead, americans think ah that's even 1% population.
Now 130k Americans dead. guys still treat joke.
So let's speak next year got 1m Americans dead white house let Trump talk. That's how. Less tv money lower standards amenities means get revenue tickets. many games 102k stadium.  Oh absolutely this. I’ve fortunate enough position work home basically changes income, roommate. work financial institution lending every single day hear people weren’t fortunate, either losing jobs getting hours, even nonessential healthcare workers. getting point people becoming financially desperate—and state shut bars restaurants unemployment income situation honestly bullshit extremely difficult actually obtain.

Gilead licensed multiple manufactures produce Remdesivir distribute undeveloped underdeveloped nations zero royalty cost.
 
Do expect Gilead give Cadillac Escalade every patient well? matt drudge old school, GWB style guy made name breaking news fast, burying shit ruling class would rather sweep away See response, 538 completely accurate basic stance immediately prior election close call, Trump 33% chance winning.

538 site got right, can't see suck interpreting statistics data. Oh agree. 

For me, result trust government less before. that's knew masks work lied us. wearing masks before, said to, I'm still wearing masks now. HI too. We’re fine here. good, im country 140 million isnt bad.

It's ""3.6 Roentgen"" pandemic death tolls! Oh understand. Desantis. Isolate vulnerable let young healthy go reasonable precautions.

But I'm guessing worship altar Lord Cuomo, master far-and-away highest per capita death toll country literally opposite thing. hey brother CNN *hilarious* interviews Mom's meatballs must something right. This. Politicians figured economy going go back normal unless high earners feel safe going out. High earners afford instacart deliveries avoid going absolute nadir (from percentage positive standpoint, 7 day rolling average percent positive standpoint, raw number standpoint) June 9. That’s 3 weeks today. true time positive death 3 weeks, death nadir right now. personal stats graphs indicate interval case positive death widening initial 1.5-2.5 week 3-4 weeks lately, sure that’s about. Yeah. 

Why trust Trump administration they'll push first thing believe work? hydroxychloroquine, bunch people died took it. I'm excited vaccine finally comes, want know kill 3 months line. think post spot-on. key needed “national” strategy. Instead individual state government freestyling. point, confused anyway countries ahead us learn from?

Also seriously point testing it’s handled systematic way get tested once. Even found I’m negative today help others getting tested too?

What shit show.. I’ve attempted quit smoking several occasions. stark contrast smokers’ shitty attitudes towards I’m quitting versus non-smokers’ support I’m quitting perfect illustration point. 

Smokers see trying kick habit condemnation lifestyle choice, non-smokers seem understand I’m trying better life. It’s eye-opening it’s pretty disgusting, honest. 3500 icu beds 620 hospital adds exponential growth concern? 20% hospitalizations dying - 50% go icu, gives 10 days adds growth. 14 days see symptoms exponential growth, real concern run capacity. That's pretty staunch, still many. Honestly countries unions complete near complete lockdown right now. takes little explode everywhere. EU know too; among first get hit hard.

Man right. sound harsh probably get in. borders open New Zealanders returning home. live Houston went new York help response. worked NYP manhattan really enjoyed response people. stores requiring people wear masks want entry. deal high risk patients, intubations nebulizer treatments, fevers pneumonia. tested negative. I’m certain masks work. back good ol state Texas people can’t bothered mask up. finally they’re imposing mask rule effect. politics there’s that. It’s 1%. like .26% certain population way lower everyone else. Like .04% carry spray bottle spray people get close like one would cat perfect soundbite cable news. need use Texas locked March 31st. lockdown expired April 30th. currently rolling back reopening.

To answer question, stayed locked longer, opened slower opinion. Since possible would good time. also would made possible cities authority enforce rules. least, Abbott spelled wanted allowed rules instead playing legal games. Graveyards need economy. think predict that, incorrect. gave trump 33% chance winning, 1 3. comes single 'trial' (sample size 1), that's basically close call, exactly said. explicit - slight polling error favouring trump, could easily win, based previous elections high probability (33% chance) could occur.

Any interpretation flawed understanding statistics people know interpret probability. sure folks 538 interpreting correctly, others mentioned basically polling group actually correct stating election close call.  I'm talking medical advice talking social discourse. Seriously, still see texans gym according IG...like wtf?, meanwhile NY barely cases gym STILL isnt open, wont allowed prob long time, agree muh freedoms! 

**Edit:** question: lol nope. ""Discriminated children""

Get fucking masks, Karen!  We're pretty good BC. I'm worried people acting like over, bite us ass hard careful. I'm talking medical advice talking social discourse. see deaths going back 1000 day. looking 300k year. Things would get really really bad break million. still might, doubt it. Maybe want grandparents die finally inherit wealth? Lol...something think about... really really shitty part froze property tax, electric anything else. dependant building setup hook taxes utilities even though one may paying. Sheeit. ... mean ... gosh, aboot sucks poor bastards.

I literally trip Hawaii August wife still refusing let cancel.... mate. WHAT? Tell American something, gonna do? it.  mean kids going beaches, people protesting also nothing it.

Salt water gurgle checking in! close bars nightclubs forever? gonna happen read somewhere Gilead planning charge around $2400 medicine. huge incentive hoard hike prices produce false demand

&amp;#x200B;

edit fix gideon Gilead smh first state lock down. Unfortunately disproportionate amount law enforcement refuses enforce wearing masks, people still refuse stay home social distance, locking helping much could. Downside large, populous state: unless everyone works together, good enough. You’re right. Thing Korea America almost time table whole thing started. One country done far better case. mean, honestly people play country music strike particularly bright think people follow orders? Especially 4th July rolling around. March/April then? prologue? Remember guys, even one new case related way protests. even comes mind fire job one cancel existence immediately. pay enough provide family.... That's issue.  “rushed” part coming directly “virus IFR less one percent.”

The rest platform development years already passed numerous safety trials.

Based COVID organs people catch survive, I’ll take chances vaccine. Fuck. number real. fake. seasonal flu kills many. Theyre allocating car accident deaths it. 

Just examples even make numbers bite size deniers cant/won't listen. Yup. Small landlords going get crushed, properties going sold mix foreign buyers large real estate holding companies. Yeah, fuck wanting leave wife give birth alone. too. planning trying move BC graduated fall. Guess that’s happening. thought said doors one entry exit control leaves easier? Still fire hazard full weld in? anti-science conspiracy theorists would get sick die, would fine that.  would achieve herd immunity. Babies immunocompromised people depend herd immunity can't get vaccine. Masks social distancing proved easy ways stopping virus spreading, seen number countries except Trump administration. months post covid still battling brain fog, fatigue clotting issues. fact, past week seems worse ever. exhausted almost wish died.  !RemindMe 1600 days molecules shut normal bodily functions? point say everyone except DMV banned customer asshole preclude professional. pressure, give facts wont 600$ bonus unemployment. Many people csnt stand discourages people taking low paying undesirable jobs keeps unemployment hire would like. 600$ extremely controversial large portion America hates it. likely try sort stimulus type thing again. Thank you. case whether Russias numbers correct think general sentiment cases accurate well country actually virus pretty easily observed numhers too. example (as recent data could find):

Singapore: 43,907 cases, 26 deaths

Right case counts

Portugal: 42,141 cases, 1576 deaths

You're always going find differences like right next havent seen anything suggest Singapores numbers fake, theyve mostly spread young healthy people (migrant workers mainly) tested sick thoroughly. exact thoughts Michigan. It’s like gave two month heads up. dumb safe Agree disgusting!

But clickbait spreading misinformation. curious from. seem informed insightful comments I've seen make, know people understand idiots everywhere.

**EDIT**: p.s. answer question; showing people exponential growth looks like 🤦‍♂️ We've already made clear legally unacceptable people pollute indoor air no-smoking laws. listen good doctors. open disclosure. invites partner health. exceeds minimum training hours. takes notes room listens concerns. goes lab values coordinates care specialist.

They absolutely invested well being.

And hear hospital's patients always case. find fascinating portion citizens country simply can't put together viral transmission works. playing may impact BRI contracts next season. Fox telling people Fauci working Biden making mountain molehill.

Hahahaha thanks chuckle bro! Kiwi, congrats, long way go good hear good news outside borders.

Kia kaha!  hear you. 95% people see wear masks. Every I'll see someone walking nose. outside. inside store since March, hopefully put right inside. also one hardest hit places (NYC), think people really get here. Unfortunately going take massive deaths 100% ICU capacity states get it. Wish like that, George Carlin said, "" Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.""

Be safe thank do. short, list permitted countries technically recommendation. According European Council, member states final say restrictions eased countries list.

Ok stop reading sci fi read science books YKnow that’s fair, ain’t doin hot. tl;dr

Patients elevated level certain cytokine (IL-13) blood tests taken hospital admittance likely end ventilator. Two cytokines also identified, less correlation. Heel. one mentioned positivity rates, increased record high new daily cases. Would care explain that? literally conversation ""the mark beast"" put vaccine Bill Gates locking dispute one occasion. Exactly, herd immunity simply expression comes vaccine programs *nothing* natural immunity responses. 

 - Everybody knows happened native americans europeans took pathogens natives genetic immunity against. anything different today, well put it; fairytale.

The world lived in, run oil gas industry, assisted safetywest, gun industry. changed favour medical industry oil gas working hard make world return was. People accept things change. world last forever way it, people adapt slower others. good start toward building writing skills read books. sound facetious don’t mean to... it’s proven correlation. herd immunity threshold defined 1 - 1/R0, sars-cov-2, seems R0 somewhere 2-3 range (but possibly high 5 depending many cases believe going undetected) would 50% - 67%. population approaches herd immunity threshold Reff approaches 1 asymptotically -- i.e., spread gradually slows (more less arobkinca said). Reff 1, illness gradually disappear (but immunity short-lived, pathogen widespread constantly evolving new forms re-infect, get cycles, influenza, variety viruses lump together ""common cold"", never completely disappears) Amazing many idiots downvoting you, literally everyone know actually speaks Chinese verify story, part. Freedumb think china home home test time back february. Cause don’t give shit u die not

Stay safe wear mask everyone. wouldn’t mattered. issue created years partisanship. country can’t act cohesively partisanship deeply rooted now.

NY: Thank you. saying everyone vegan? went home california college ended, missing Mass already poor submit drug testing free corona test handout given. /s mention Fox News mainstream media. higher viewership media TV. problem live Spain. 80-90% wearing voluntarily even mandatory. Greatest country getting away mass genocide nothing else. Tldr: pandemic, many women realize suck picking partners.  Japanese society also know wear masks wash hands without told either site could see list names deceased state?  It’s article, it’s commerce website, makes real Yeah ICU nurses specially trained, can’t graduate turn around become ICU nurse. ""My lord, legal?""

Trump: ""I'll make legal."" Good you! People act neighborly anymore! Nobody seems understand meaning community days, really tragic. merely teaser trailer trailer movie that’s coming soon. Please don’t tempt fate. due respect, precisely trials first. 

They'll release risk vaccine lower risk virus.

It 100%, safer balanced data time. ""My humps, humps, lovely lady bumps"" - Shakespeare wouldn’t address issues people wearing masks. It’d likely opposite effect deter them. People really don’t underhand anti-mask phenomenon. 

What’s driving anti-mask belief response virus politically motivated. distrust type messaging they’d likely become convinced following dangerous. Nah look I've convinced months ago. absolutely zero proof kind body works virus like cold flu moves unmolested, proof supposed immunity. I'd bet every last cent right thing going explode places supposedly ""beat"" it. herd immunity shit fairy tale. going work. cell shit misguided cope, cells basically tear lung tissue shreds cause cytokine storm kills you. one done immune shit joke. People desperately clinging nonsense thing right instead accepting fact need drastically change approach lot things deal monstrosity. ????????? would take them? keep seeing Twitter get blocked every time ask going ventilator impounding. Doctors? Nurses? aren’t risking jobs rob patients. document everything bring would pretty obvious missing. would hospital want liable theft? It’s like identical. different brands models. personal vents labeled owners contact info. It’s going accidentally purpose get mixed hospital supply. 

The ventilators aren’t usually owned patients all, typically owned DME company paid patients insurance. $15,000+ ventilator isn’t going anywhere without fight DME likely insurance company. Plus patients backup vent. don’t need hounding insurance company get resolved. won’t age well. Time stock toilet paper again. Arizona Southwest get back CA CO test positivity rates greater 10%. (3000-2728)/47 = 5.78 days, probably within week. [Not really problem US number tests, enough capacity atm. contact tracing isolation positive cases bigger issue. ""Like help take mask off.""

""But die.""

""Nothing stop now. once, let look eyes."" points correct. political ignorant selfish reasons prevailed.  biggest con time: unlocking Green mode Robinhood  hospital 1 nurse 1 patient ICU, two possible neither critical rules. 3-4 high care possibly critical patients? That’s... going end well, many RTs floor? Even going patient patient you’d need many, ESPECIALLY you’ve got ECMO patients, need 24/7 visual supervision. Shit going get bad fast. drunk? know research carried out? lol  Thank accepting double-autism greater good. PLA earned reputations back China people going front line 1998's Flood lost lot 1989. think got maths wrong. buy 1 lottery ticket, 1 chance n win lottery. buy two tickets, two chances n. tickets matter large gathering

:( opened without curve properly flattened; time; mature responsible citizens Defying governor’s orders going gym, yoga ballet class. Probably actually read it. say far period. said far ***as evidence***, neither are. 

Let simplify sentence attention span.

Nobody's ""thinking"" ""feeling"" evidence all. Could still compiling data. Could they've decided put another bucket (see comment elsewhere yearly spike ""unknown parasite"" causes death).

Seems like believe insane flu May, Florida magical outlier fairytaleland mis-classified covid deaths. true, either Florida suddenly became magical outlier fairytaleland June they've simply changed misreporting methods. Haha real. I’m blown away people rejecting idea may enough medical equipment everyone day shortage PPE doctors nurses. currently failing every level respond pandemic, yet 6 months completely eradicated? realistic

“We shortages literally everything currently, we’ll get act together last 2:00 minutes game hundreds millions free vaccines!” -same people said heat would make go away know California many counties next other. live Riverside County. I'm next Los Angeles Orange County. three counties list. would drive least two hours get county restricted. underrated comment I'm really happy hear growth journey!

I think wealthy, grow society feels normal. Society works you. car needs repair, repaired. go Dentist. save money buy house attend college without much effort.

And really easy think everyone else lives society.

And seen that's case. Poor folks different society. Shit that's broken stays broken. becomes another obstacle work it.

This Bill Gates shocked pandemic response. lives society works him. assumed worked everyone least degree. Well, definitely won’t argue there!!! Add today list...26,239 new cases two weeks ago, 404 deaths far today compared 819 last Wednesday...two weeks 21,000 new cases. look up, get money covid related funny..I remember people arguing back forth Georgia experiencing surge even though first states reopen...I guess new surges take months develop simply 2-3 week process like originally believed? Yeah, kinda like anonymity wearing N95 mirrored goggles. stealthy! concern least. thought commonplace close restrooms stores restaurants elsewhere guess not. Yup, someone collecting unemployment I'm even sure mine runs out. am. Four neighboring counties half hour away depending direction travel. Hol long family still alive, don’t think it’s late whatever stop coronavirus. July. fucking July require masks? one fucked country. Sigh. herd immunity wiki says right there. COVID-19 R0 value 2-6, equating HIT value 50-83%.

That's substantially different said. give less credence higher end range; case iceberg theory weakened 50-83% population needs infected developed immunity, vaccinated, herd immunity starts working stop exponential growth.

That's different said, except missing (what obvious) thing mechanism: Reff stay R0 right moment HIT reached drop instantly 1. Reff life epidemic basically sigma-shaped. Therefore, effects nearing HIT **are** noticable **before** threshold reached.

This fact early (and opinion) quite strong argument iceberg/flu-like-fatality crowd: case necessitated positing NYC nearing HIT time daily case load NYC showed sign decline due nearing HIT. (there decline, much -- less even, case United States -- one would expect mandated mitigations and/or mobility data).  really. Marriage thing. screaming Karens supermarkets 40-60 years old? new definition ""young?"" Yeah it’s one thing drive 4 minutes hit local bar. many people make 4 hour drive 1 direction go bar middle nowhere. may surprised learn Dan Patrick-- Lt. Governor--is fact former broadcast sports talk radio personality bar Outperforming majority male counterparts must satisfying. Whitmer badass. would implement Zero Contact administrators / professors / workers (which hard), students would stay campus.

In effect, student body would like one giant household, admin, professors, workers would like 3rd party delivery. 

But smart people there, I'm sure figure something out. story ""Cornell mass outbreak due failed on-campus study plan"" pretty shit way make news. wear damn mask. hard sound childish arguing exceptions. blonde anything? Abilene forget security campus dining workers cleaner crews many people seal Oh agree may higher, actually UK car accidents went *up* double digit percent lockdown. 

The emptier roads led increased speeding, therefore increase accidents.

&amp;#x200B;

But countries (India) went down. could go either way. hard time believing, choose stay open willingly let people put others risk, California can't something it. What's point shutdowns people able go inside casino least 2500 others. objective conclusion one reach looking excess death counts worldwide covid deaths undercounted. Unless want argue reason excess mortality spiking world wide.  love argument protest actually slowed spread bc ppl we're scarred stayed in. 🤣😭

So believe Ron DeSantis peril. RemindMe! 2 weeks  shit vaccine imo
75% efficacy good still immune  I’m defending people protests, talking point. estimated 1-2% US population attended one. states reopened bars restaurants, traffic based reservations travel suggests returned 75% pre-COVID activity. Coupled mask aversion places, likely contributed 10x spread protests. It’s missing forest trees. protests basically died down, people still want eat shop, don’t take main lesson went wrong, we’ll get spikes next time try reopen. 4 5 Dentists Approve statement.

DISCLAIMER: fifth Dentist ass. main concern long-term safety. measure efficacy pretty easily short time period. Bullshit. go anywhere public elderly walking around without God damn care world One study done Canada put lag median 18.5 days, time first symptom death. First symptoms said average 5 - 6 days infection, let's call 5.5.

That gives us average 24 day lag enacting control measures witnessing full impact death count. guess you’re right people won’t think ahead much Tldr 781,000 total deaths United States three months May 30 122,300, nearly 19% higher, would normally expected, according researchers. 122,300 excess deaths, 95,235 attributed Covid-19, said. rest excess deaths, researchers said, likely related directly caused coronavirus.

So 20k 28k potential undercount. Aka 20-30% hear lot too. one people clung too? Thanks.

RemindMe! 3 weeks hand phone. great, use conspiracy people keep telling death count massively exaggerated Ya wear masks indoors people truley risk need quarantine MI towns already shut downtown traffic allow restaurants expand outdoor seating. imagine now. $1,200 even cover one month rent let alone provide enough people period 3-4 months. unemployment benefits go everyone unemployed. also nothing people still employed also suffering financial burdens pandemic think comes matter statistics. majority college students seem favor person courses. tuition paid, leases signed. 

The problem risk mitigation. statistically chance plane could crash? car could crash? could catch mono? Yes. die those? Yes. weigh operate state state reasonable leaders take risks calculation along financial risks furloughing entire school years. 

We operate daily risk mitigation mind. don’t think it’s medically accurate say anything longitudinal regarding scaring damage viral infections. kinds problems common lot viruses including mono. actually think students understand risks. think teenagers young adults given credit critically thinking.

-White House, June 30th 2020 hard work. coworkers uninformed employer required reopen meeting discuss local guidelines, protocol, would practice safety. meeting bypassed time coworkers wear masks dealing customers (and even then, wear beneath noses).

Who cares? I'm tired celebrities thinking they're special care think. dumbass catch covid himself? worry wont take long northeastern region live small city heard multiple people complain wearing masks. would say aren’t LA wear masks? 

But...the thing is...we don’t want like LA. That’s taking much precautions. worst case scenario would probably take longer arrive make easier. wrong, im sorry im sure live, means supporters alone this. far actually. Americans selfish flip get told do. culture. 23 year old, trying give advice— even empathetic kind way— cause outright lose friends get labeled controlling narcissist &amp; might even get shunned entire friend group. think spread rehab center first place? Viruses go rehab centers retirement homes automatically. Someone something gave someone, likely gave parents. 

But hey, flu bro. yea testing capacity... Yep Given high risk first offered it. take it. bit myth vaccines hidden long term side effects. biggest risk first days/risk taking given Phase III trials, suggests risks exist. 

Obviously I, anyone else, can't say risk. H1N1 vaccine 2009, example, gave 1/50,000 young people form Narcolepsy - way finding stuff like vaccinating entire population given rarity. 

 regulators extremely strict independent nothing approved unless meets criteria. unquestionable putting risk taking it. American people ** They’re upset arent getting too. don’t blame them. 

In Alaska, every single citizen gets dividend year. isn’t viewed morally. Instead, it’s viewed *pragmatically*. isn’t “this person getting money nothing.” It’s “I got check, it?” It’s time. one ever made black plague. problem isnt IFR problem spread hcs overload, Americans actually gonna find second time Young people like [Alex 53 year old ""young adult"" who's refusing cooperate contact tracers?

The article sites random quotes (which could get age demographic ask enough people) attributed ""young people"" (not even naming source). 

Later on, talks ""half cases"" young people - there's nothing behind number say care. Younger people likely jobs put risk - service jobs. probably ones delivering food, making food, staffing grocery store. Younger nurses going likely ones assigned higher risk functions. lot easier stay home isolate 2k squarefoot home, paid off, retired, 3 roommates, live city need work pay rent. 

And current political climate. Even true - boomer generation done much last decades encourage younger generations want sacrifice them. 

Look, I've got job lets work home, nice house enough space get claustrophobic, two kids keep SUPER busy - I'm wearing mask staying home. article pisses regardless. I'm guessing Fauci invested dollars. think you’re absolutely right, NJ add believe 1,500 backlog deaths one day probably it. gotta wonder many times that’ll happen sporadically road ahead administrators, professors, students workers live campus? move onto campus. would campus sealed. Depends state. 

For instance, max amount normally get unemployment Florida entire year, $3,300. 

For entire year. Yes, $3,300. that's MAXIMUM, many people qualify ofr maximum. lot.

Again, knock off. one, say 300. article says ""over 300"". another, Florida underreported 28%, would move 21 deaths 27. nothing.

I'm sure else say. showed 3 week lag reference New York's numbers.

Uh oh contradictory True, everyone must make decisions risks take. going hard time drawing new equation there's going many variables website covid exit strategy column shows positive percentage far right-hand side testing ratio sort middle, increase cases far left. almost microbes adapted spread human stupidity. many pandemics would stopped dead tracks people would simple things like wear mask go bars wear condom. want shit rich famous, I'll say Jeff Bezos Elon Musk first one line get vaccination. I’m little overweight smoke (yup, stupid, know). guess count ‘preconditions’. 

I’ve super scared outbreak, (even early February, reports Wuhan came in) point everytime coughed shortness breath (who’d guess.. smoker), convinced it; resulting even anxiety shortness breath.

At certain point chose follow advice given subsequently stopped following news r/coronavirus regular basis. definitely helped calm down.

Combine fact current numbers country pretty low compared two months ago (Netherlands), I’m pretty confident that, still act sensible, chances contracting (atm!) pretty low.

Wear mask, keep distance, stay away tight and/or packed (badly ventilated) places, hope majority people same. 

I guess easier said done, especially live hotzone right now. things get better eventually. follow advice people know do. far, shut restaurants, bars, gyms, salons, retail still allowed stay open...? :/ contradicts everything published scientific papers head back r/conspiracy, u belong.

I also dont speak dutch btw.  would expect person classes amount paid, especially since many schools literally adding **extra** fees online teaching, despite fact they’re also still requiring people pay normal tuition... includes fees campus use.

Thats honestly students abstain- person classes aren’t safe right now. Taking semester two isn’t end world, especially pandemic. grandfather always told ""if birds upside down, drunk ground."" Wise man. 

lmao think it’s fair point concerned spreading older people. average age testing positive low good thing rise, would good indicator concerns merited.

As far knowing immunity, it’s pretty safe bet. able prove 100% everyone lasting immune response though, scientists generally confident people get sick twice disease. Oh, get it, talking reason people seem getting upset with. Living girlfriend mom Florida, mom working home Monday couple days ago....

What’s phone number 9-1-1? Something tells OP written Note app sadly increases every week. Oh god. 13 favourite. Absolutely   1.

2. stated, treatment skills. two helpful therapeutics, cure, healthcare workers learned ton treat sick patients (not intubating early)

3. Much improved protection nursing homes. Nursing homes account roughly 43% deaths country, think CFR near 20% among nursing home residents, 4-5 times greater overall CFR. family forced

So everyone panicked, closed entire hospitals, tested EVERYONE.

[Disclaimer get idea we're seeing cases testing US. know anyone else, I'm going go get swab stuck brain unless I'm feeling pretty shitty think might actually it. guess I'm saying like people bored going getting tested fun. Testing mandated anything, seek out. got tested days ago taking trip south. putting self test back touched bin leave tests bare hand (dumb know). used hand sanitizer right after, wasn’t able wash hands ~20 minutes later. didn’t touch face, touch phone, steering wheel, etc. risk paranoid? reference live CT Find type exercise/activity enjoy doing

Change small things diet - adding flax seed ground beef patties, 2% milk instead whole milk, using breads fiber, conscious snacking, etc

For 95% people obese choice. Sorry unpopular opinion. 

Our biochemistry genetics predispose us obesity making challenge overcome others.

This true anything. Samuel Jackson stutter child still struggles day... Yet he's actor speech critical. 

Don't sell short tell can't x,y,z reasons. Believe yourself. it, promise. ""They're crisis actors trying take President."" way prevent happening... see Arizona record amount cases, positive % rate today? want spoil party vaccines produced haste quantity billions pose pretty big risk. Why? Vaccines take long time testing. .01% caused severe response that's 7,800,000. can’t say it’s good cape cod. live falmouth half people see don’t one on. However inside wear it’s required. We’re still better lot places though. get unexpected burden ""conflict resolution"". Okay. Still, point say people exist? Yes! masks Rt much easier number deal it’s good.

Ro number related hypothesis, whereas Rt data-based number. stand thing, Ro epidemiologists’ hypothesis disease spreads naturally, Rt number get based many cases rise day. Wow lot deaths Arizona today. exactly big population either. see plenty articles, make sense. areas protests definitely seeing uptick (houston, atlanta, etc). continue, can't see going anywhere good. i'm trusting science moment, gatherings register positive. Deaths going GOOD. Come now. makes sense. called around said rapid results doctor's discretion. visit dentist take care teeth. “May”

“Suggest”

“Experts say” (notice never name “experts”)

“Likely”

“Unlikely”

“Might”

“Could”

Any news contains words ignore. It’s inconclusive. Masks not, social distancing done. I'm sure masks cotton going shield covid. everybody N95's.. yeah, maybe. Ah, I'm knowledgeable either, result simple 5-minute Google search lol find goats spreading virus? tested them. read last week someone eaten uncooked fruit vegetable since February due virus. That’s level critical thinking looking at... Ok. want people go randomly killing livestock would test first see kill them? add data:

[Disclaimer Tesla better anyone, resulting air quality path rapid improvement, Musk thank that. flaws, took singular vision get done.

Tesla suceeded. time everyone move stop supporting Elon's toxicity. Blarg. Hope came back negative! Freedom facts. I've wondering country music still putting concerts last 36 years.  Tom Segura special ""cajuns"" feels appropriate reading list. Honestly, problem viewing real estate, especially residential real estate investment. well people snapping properties either flip, rent poor people, loan airbnb. shrinks pool properties available people want nothing buy place call own, causing prices skyrocket. Meanwhile, developers interest building luxury homes, apartments, etc. new affordable housing built. shed tear rent seekers. Sell property financial burden. leave nose uncovered. math checks out, half effective mask filters 200% particles still safe! Dang. Thanks confirming. Here's updated chart new AZ COVID cases last 3 months (with today's data): 

- **Cases:** largest daily case total date largest death total added single daily report. 7-day avg heading north again. headed 100,000 cases within next week.
- **Testing:** Higher normal PCR testing 17K. likely labs expanding capacity.  
- **Spread:** Overall PCR positive test percentage shot 12% 12.4% (based 549K tests, 6.6% low) average week shot 24% (based 3K cases, 20% last week). 
- **Hospital Utilization:** COVID Hospitalizations went 3% (another time high). ICU beds COVID patients dropped 1% (Overall ICU bed usage shot 86% 89%). Ventilators use COVID went 2%. 

*Data Source: Yea, gives fuck bout professors anyway? actually think it’s state state basis.

Mass protests heavily masked ran testing specifically targeting protesters found low rate. 

Other states (judging photos online) didn’t nearly enough masked protesters... Brush teeth, nasty. enough kill 1/20 people within month getting it

This even close true. highest state listed, NJ, death rate 0.169%... yeah insignificant compared afflictions. don’t think Florida hotspot beaches, it’s hotspot whole tourism industry including restaurants bars check vit levels. example, individuals wish participate protests, perhaps due fear violence police clashes general unrest, may chosen avoid public spaces protests underway. could offsetting effect, increasing social distancing behavior parts population. net effect, social distancing spread COVID-19 thus empirical question, focus study. Honestly?  Motivation. Losing weight like trying quit smoking giving drugs. “plans” follow, “specialists” help counseling, “medications”, often sheer willpower driving factor many people’s success. None things easy, support loved ones helps ton. deck stacked you, starting new path difficult, worth it. require changes lifestyle self-discipline, think positive benefits reap continue journey towards success. wish best luck, much patience. There’s quick fix. takes hard work little bit daily sacrifice. (Gained 50 pounds college, slowly lost diet changes, back highschool weight 30’s now). Think loved ones, think health, think extra time may together things. think life we're going live now? pretty depressing, socializing much? I've isolated sucks, like ton close friends either. northern southern Indian wedding? least ones I've to, North India gets wild. South India mostly sitting, eating extremely fast, taking photo couple, leaving.

I've handful though

Edit: looks like north India. Dancearoo 2 electric bugaloo Oh worry, Swedish Defense force shortly mass downvote post

Oddly see way sentiment sub see pro-Swedish troll brigades. almost *up*voted! Death rate still pitiful though. even broken 1000 day yet. depressing haha I’m still getting mad everybody drinking eating out. It’s ridiculous. Nobody bar Friday night. agree. Fuck elected officials. pray health family friends Southern California.

Edit: lmao fuck say pray for. sanitize floors workmen wear shoes inside too. concern parasites - people step dog poop backyards, wipe most, think again. Ew. bad? 15% positive horrific. That’s ignore good news numbers start matching it. “Good news” means nothing realized benefit. Im still waiting part trickle. 11% think scientists medical researchers blame resurgence. mean... what? famous last words New York currently exceptionally low positive rate they’ve really busted butts getting thing control happened April.

I’d say risk well 1%. blaming China start... question ask... aslo blame media saying ""flight bans infected countries"" useless... usefull China same... anyone ask kids go back school every rich country earth?  testing, rear contact tracing, plan temp checks kids enter school 

It madness I've seen White Buffalo live times count last 4 years. One awesome shows planet. Bought beer Vietnam vet one songs soldiers used pawns useless wars. definitely saved list reference. Thank you. “The news subtitled Swedish, English and
What news? SVT? That's official govermental source though. it?”

Well it’s state run television also broadcast presser. It’s almost like want government channel. 

“I'm saying Nordic nations offer summaries pressers English and/or languages, live subtitles.”

Links please

“Norway pressers outbreak bad, still occasion update teh public. Ditto Dk, FI, IS.”

In many languages? dictatorship. logic, everyone ban chinese travelers. least danger everyone else. really think texas testing everyone reporting correct numbers. FFS Texas one states reporting low amount covid deaths 500% increase pneumonia deaths deaths natural causes? Corona also believes bar lives matter too.. Ok fun watching kids get sent back school northeast safe. That’s said. Probably people could get sick goats care. probably appreciate safer knowledge.


I'd hate see upset tested chickens instead. mean older generations fucking younger generations myriad ways. 

Compared 40-50 years ago 250 hours minimum wage vs 1000 cover typical college fees.

House today cost triple 1970 compared average wage. area least housing prices insane largely property owner, read old people, block new develooments keep property values high.

Millenials lucky get 75 cents dollar pay SS medicare.

Did know changed health insurance laws 55-64 age group pay 3 times 19-25 group. Young peoples premiums went 45% old group go 17%? making mandatory insurance. Basically every young person give away least $500 year benefit group average income 20k higher them? 

Shifting tax burden away passive investment income labor. 

Lack action climate change.

Most young people know, included, distance vulnerable person lives want get sick. also know people good it. selfish yeah. time I'm really sure anyone would expect young people group put lives hold good old people really seem give damn them.   timeline best get tested?

Everyone family self-quarantining since pandemic began. Yesterday, however, family member randomly showed house. kept distance member spoke outside. 

Is chance may got talking outside? know even it, anxiety overdrive right now.

Would also wait 14 days get tested see it? AKA Morons without masks. New York mask requirement since mid April. hired helper done online tutors According article, looks like they’re actually losing money prices.

The Institute Clinical Economic Review, nonprofit group calculates fair prices drugs, estimated Gilead would need charge $1,600 per regimen recoup costs. much $5,080 per treatment course would still cost-effective price insurers, given patients would able leave hospital sooner. local news. small media market here. went job interview day offered 11$ hour. I’m getting 1600 dollars every two weeks stay home unemployed. system soo fucked. Governors aren’t paying citizens millions dollars year.

Well mean, are, citizens don’t make state billions dollars.

Well, guess do, but...

States care citizens. warning ? Even W.H.O. say everything control back Basically day 28, 45 subjects didn’t major side effects. 28 days...  Yes stuck hospital bills eviction moratoriums ending July states.

Also takes 2-4 weeks process death cases. high cases meaning rising deaths coming weeks. Without wanting confront anything, careful enough, able live diabetes whole life without thing kills you? Americans (not Americans, know, whole) many ways brainwashed propaganda North Korea.

NK prop government itself, common people actually believe crap they're forced say do. US, government, many common people perpetuate many half-truths American history built on, ignoring actively suppressing critical history entering common knowledge, like Tulsa Massacre. Mostly it’s trump anti-maskers. Yes, yes yes. reason can’t little empathetic discussing consequences things improved. earlier comment specifically mob people reddit love judging entire country based actions bad leaders (and course shitty citizens). It’s regarding US. amount US bashing, glee people seem experiencing US travellers barred entering Europe, etc. It’s awful people lack empathy recognise pandemic race say “we least number people dead won”. joe agrees last person talked Also, back reported hospitalisations fatalities still close zero, China build whole field hospital Eastern border town, treat patients come back Russia. livestock get it, kill them, burn bodys. Spend time trying save people rather 50 damn goats responding 962 quite lot. $4,185 per month quite lot unemployment, matter country from.

And really spent time look post history find response income? Yikes. Maybe pick hobby. know know contagious means? It’s good! Parents working problem is, MIS-C delayed reaction. many 7,000 6 weeks majority cases diagnosed recently? .1%? 1%? 2%? beautiful parts province vastly overshadowed bad days think children areas cases low absolutely sent back school

Idiotic. Sweet, good luck! Pro tip: still burn bridges regardless relation think obvious reason group doctors work children’s want schools open back there’s probably many injured sick kids days.

I wonder bad that’s affecting bottom line. keep really simple. f cares couple fucken goats thousands infected getting either tested treated.
I mean one simplest common sense realise, goddamn fucken goat??? yup. limited options. i'm hoping serbia close back cases rising everyone nuts. but, so, i'll hang UK longer. 5 months visa time. “If employee want come work concern might expose at-risk member household, HR provide employee document employee sign submit confirm situation receive Unpaid Leave May 31.” 

I understand Tesla wrong Came contact someone came contact people New York awaiting covid test results. 

I’m super worried, also, long take get test results back New York? Whilst I'm pleased germany, Germany Europe it? Germany small part Europe wealthiest part.  Certainly didnt slow spread idea works, sorry fired DOH official said week Florida starts screw numbers show they’re controlling spread. 

If testing there, Florida would seeing 12k+ positive cases per day given 15% positivity rate. testing appears drastically decreasing across state. know long term effects feeding unhealthy food

And get stupid train. fun mental gymnastics Olympic trials. explains positivity rate stuck around 15% level.. rate positive tests going up. Plus, prisons. test time. WAY WAY up.. Guess works shitty min wage jobs... completely sympathize 84 year old mother shit. Every time think gets it, she’s high risk activity like returning church going graduation party.  posts negative, commentary following post always is. example post something norway followed comment bad things sweden. That's bit sad posted news relevant subreddit. already tried insulting mine assuming zero knowledge I'm working front line emergency fucken covid patients.
As said. America close 3m infections, rising average 40k infections day.
Now maths I'm sure, proof pudding.
These called home made masks little fashion statement cases. 
If n95 medical standard equivalent, may well nothing. Anyone thinks bunk, go look ""innate immunity response"" half assed hypothesis. point article schools need opened protect children parents.

How get situation government workers raise children properly? Luckily wife seems pretty good PPE. also gets tested every ten days so. hope theory somehow providing many every day keep pace. Even though got millions Grant money work drug... I'm glad see still want rake consumer. hear results stage 3.  Oh, that's different, sorry getting hostile Early 20-something here: I'm freakin' concerned, family (including extended). say I'm paranoid exclude family get togethers. hope miss funerals. Yes, that's science works. damn near impossible prove something 100%, that's p-values. outbreak July 4th probably won’t reflected hospitalizations end month Oof sorry challenge Well, hear people serve food hospital too, he’s good go. 

/s 😆 keep really simple you....the animals tested *protect* humans. Magically home high risk person stops high risk may 31.... Percentages dude Again, basic information. Please find official english summaries press conferences. would LOVE see that, would useful keep status Sweden. 


Also cut shit since can't find thos eand well known problem Sweden give enough info languages: 

http://archive.vn/NVDXw simple, 'model' made many different decisions strategies, successful, less so. Different countries also different starting conditions, stochastic, number undetected imported cases beginning, due public health policy, elder care structured, demographic, population density.

Reducing 'model' said either succeeded failed helpful tells us little. really want learn something, need look *where* failed, *why*. many areas exposed problems, state public healthcare system one, could've also quicker find quarantine initial imported cases, look current situation, looks like things control. Yeah germany slow believe masks. But, looked science changed advice. fantastic lesson things change possible people willing listen science control. Merkel Söder islands sanity sea bullshit. recently moved Germany UK following what's happening back UK head hands ever since left. happier live country afraid change course even means admitting got something wrong.

 think German people part also done good job adapting get odd idiot wear mask, part supermarkets trains feel safe enough almost 100% mask wearing, Abstand signs etc. hope people keep begin slack Little ironic really seems good way *not* go debt U.S. limit risks getting sick needing medical care (the people going see Ramsey aren’t generally people oodles money pay medical expenses comfortably either). due co-pays deductibles, risk insurance, time work, risk short long term disability on... Thank Exercise good immune system good mental well-being. I'd say go long 'hot spot', skip gloves. Gloves anything magical - stick hand-washing sanitizer (unless want use ""isolate"" hands remind touch face). 

This sprint - going marathon. Keep safe today, also keep health sanity could continue many months. Yet nyc restaurants focused takeout/delivery even pandemic. cost real estate high - it’s either upscale takeout/delivery. worries, people get $5 discount ticket!

“FIRST RESPONDER, MILITARY, HEALTHCARE GENERAL ADMISSION DISCOUNT TICKET
$20.00+ $2.47 fee.” guy posts WSB, way. He's stocks, apparently. facetious referring ""rest country."" fault specifying states fucked themselves, take personally. believe CO one states actually intelligent response it, it? Plus seeing CO progressive state, surprise guys way less push back population policies. makes sense guys fine never *too* much issue.

Having said that, absolutely naive think population density play roll. Like, say straight face? 

Looking deaths Johns Hopkins site [New comparing clear deaths *trended* similarly states, different magnitudes. think is? I'm gonna go way limb - far really - say New Jersey [1,207 people per sq. mile compared Colorado's 55/sq NYC?

But no, I'm sure right pop. density *nothing* meteoric increase numbers outset pandemic.

Now said alllll that, even bring did? person responded talking improving *trend* talking cold hard total number. Two extremely different metrics. person right - *have* done good job managing northeast lot southern states egregiously squandering situation could've mostly prevented. conversation relevance total deaths date? number lower income kids school disappeared. send social workers find always babysat another kid relative speak english distance learning. Many don’t internet access literally every automaker worst history Tesla , GM Ford multiple workers death due C 19 mention VW cheating scandal list goes least Tesla would helping environment Yea did, look states 🤭 Germany says enough reserve now, expects Gilead fulfill obligation. 

So need country Europe elsewhere worry? another country doesn’t enough reserve doesn’t trust Gilead meet obligation? Toilet rolls shelves like normal too!

Still, can't let guard down. this. One day soon successfully eradicate Jets entirely.

How dare work healthcare. Hospice care specific, benefits. ridiculous. problem America home masks material . 

But people aren’t wearing masks all. 

Whatever we’re trying?

Dude. aren’t trying. 0 new cases cause people don’t want get tested. Let alone takes 4-7 days get results back. calm people down. C Depends test. labs receiving thousands tests day there's massive backlog. Fuck. goes paintball plans 2020. Thank you, Paris! Whitey Morgan, Sturgil Simpson. dont need gym work matter I’m pissed pandemic gonna get re-elected. facts Exactly, interest rates low. Jason Kenny (premier Alberta) new Trump Canada. Vacémon! ever really 100%. still looking at, what, 50% infected? 25%? Herd immunity effective number people get infected recover. HI numbers inevitably grow, infection numbers grow. So, still large fraction population getting infected. antibodies, cells well.

Actually, number cases (I've seen 40%, 30% 20% three published studies), depending infection severity, actually produce protective antibodies, seems 90%+ produce cells offer least degree protection amount time.

To answer OP's question, produce cells antibodies response initial infection; also create various 'helper' cells specific disease reexposure body mount rapid and, hopefully, effective response.

Think immune 'memory', immune memory marks difference primary (initial) secondary (subsequent) immune response. Beach areas = Little Flordia don’t first amendment right go fucking beach, dummy USA! USA! isn't! we've got Bar lives matter..

is Bro lives matter? wonder anti-maskers/Covidiots react this? would make sure bring legs 1. advertising air filters. Look website URL.

2. shit take. people want wear mask people say, ""if got Corona, get Corona"".

There lot great traditional country happening. Butvit isnt mainstream. 

Two examples.
Josh turner (not crappy nash trash guy. one). banjo Russ issue even though lot positive tests, we're using information effectively. let people know they're sick recommend try spread it.

We're mandating masks, contact tracing, enforcing quarantines, etc

Also, need perform many tests we're still getting high proportion positive fiancee doctor public hospital. freedom lines conservative ideals mind you.

The individual President. I’ve never actually met Karen would call “young people.” Never said Easter 2020... got technicality think played perfectly, politically speaking, him. jumped initially show he’s strong leader. everyone started bitching reopening, backed bend rules per counties’ request.  cases surging county officials looking wondering going spin one, pushes mandate again. Wait sun come back up. walk car may change bit lol It’s “refuse wear masks even though scientists medical professionals strongly recommended it”, it’s “refuse wear masks scientists medical professionals strongly recommended it”. that’s problem. We’ve got president large portion society anti-science, anti-facts, anti-common sense, anti-compassion, anti-sacrifice. America, ignorant dumbass badge honor. someone tell hcq+azt got dismissed first place? drug pretty much free There’s also element “why would open bars indoor seating restaurants wasn’t safe? know can’t wear masks eating drinking, risk must low they’re telling it’s ok go” people selfish. always said want apart society, respectful people. that, go live woods. wear mask people. different keeping music night. Yes, like listening music people get early might hate music. Since CHOOSE live city, duty respectful neighbors.

(-\_-) Someone else mentioned pnemonia deaths, another part Florida originally testing younger people. increased testing turns young people likely get it, significantly less likely die it. 

Conversely, elderly hunkered taking seriously; likely option, since many retired go work. They'll certainly notice hit.

Yea know study saying death toll people dying COVID much underreported like headline suggests. Rather deaths Alzheimer's disease, etc. gone way bc treatment withheld. also know hardest hit places retirement homes assisted living facilities. keep places isolated see significant drop deaths. tried talking specifically mindset? understand struggles idea forgoing hobbies, even don’t agree engaging said hobbies, accept point view.

If try empathize part decision making, may make easier talk engaging high risk activities.

Stuff like Golf honestly isn’t high risk, it’s something loves, thing like restaurants getting haircut limited right now. Maybe accentuate may concerned himself, you’re incredibly concerned him. 

If he’s otherwise usually reasonable guy, may willing find middle ground way, especially “support” activities. isn’t good take off, outside gets dirty spreads infection. wear mine time first put (usually walking store) walk door home, point either wash sink place designated dirty mask bin. you’re wearing well fitting cloth mask, comfortable enough really isn’t big deal. maybe basic lot people Good thing friends. exciting season 10 years. good though, gives team time adjust since coaches roster shaken I’m three immunosuppressants city people walk cars generally jaywalk get really close window. cars ac broken keep windows open. mask safety. Italy hard lockdown 2 months. could leave home jog walk around block travel groceries/medications, go essential job (which needed letter employer saying essential) family medical reasons. I'm doubtful death stats timely, could wrong Oh even notice Im 19 im pretty much person know hasn’t returned normal life point. Parties, work, bars, etc. see social media. Im reaching point im questioning even worth it. hell bars sanitize everything? end mask vigilance spectrum? completely agree, I’m stating opinion national government more. There’s plenty local campaigns policies implemented national leadership follow. 

This also problem: throwing hands air saying “they’re screwing up” doesn’t solve anything. educate people community. correct people grocery store. can’t change something top down, bottom way go! Hi. live Az.

Reports local nurses doctors facebook rationing imminent.

We shut bars Monday, exponential growth cases headed hospital next 2 weeks gaurenteed. 85% capacity even surge beds dont run out, staffing shortages already happening. die bed somewhere wont nurse.  


Arizona doesnt need downplaying virus all. People still refuse wear masks here. Disaster, need help states Season 2021: Episode 5

Much death wrought COVID-19 unprecedented quickly evolving G4 Swine Flu played major cities rural areas across USA.

With one stopping anyone anything anymore live crazy world, one remaining filmmakers Sasha Joelle Achilles, goes open visit vast crematoriums across country burning tens millions bodies stacked COVID-19 G4 Swine Flu deaths. That’s definitely part it. Back March way quicker put people ventilators it’s really best course action, go one chance survival something like 20%. They’re still used absolute last resort thing, they’re trying lot drugs/treatments like steroids etc prevent patient going one. 

I also think ramped testing helps, back March really couldn’t get tested easily often weren’t either already admitted hospital right point it. believe able catch earlier also gives patient better chance survival. sharp increase Arizona shut back down? Arizona one state. also live era information, however millions go misinformation. think got wealthy? one really surprised point maybe trying find excuses people closed spaces / bars / restaurants perfect virus breeding ground / cause this.

There conspiracy truth protests caused this, cares. time people grouping without masks &amp; safe distancing, cause rise cases. matter caused, thing matters causing upticks cases.

I get weird race based issue here, people races came protest. don’t mean offense you, kinda look like hypocrite posting whilst actively engaging sub way are. you’re damned stay informed you’re damned don’t, that’s point. real important thing i’m learning managing emotions letting information overload whip frenzy actually informed without going deep end. think it’s fair assume days absolutely need turn internet focus selves, part situation people can’t—or don’t want to—adequately deal difficult information experiences...you definitely survive thrive turn noise social media, comes time stuff requires pay attention, guess what, still thrive immerse madness it, it’s difficult... widespread common lingering symptoms make essentially 0% chance long term damage. Also, anyone suggestions improvements data they'd like see, we're open new feature additions! Italy, 97 deaths reported lockdown day, 969 deaths 19 days later. need transport people hospital hospital without plan sight, already heavily fucked up. Hospitalisation already increasing much, next step ICUs, deaths. live rural area another state. situation. cases, deaths, many people think it’s flu, many swear already December. don’t know say them, almost definitely didn’t December. person tested 8,000 times bled death based we've seen, seems likely cybertruck would crack axel trying run Thanks reasonable reply, reckless this. 3 hours away worst case got extremely crowded feels unsafe could drive home. place beach northern end, Myrtle. much way expect crowds. Probably fired wave smile end. ""unprofessional behavior"" bullshit like that. That's two get trouble. !RemindMe 3 Weeks Hey: looking like ""What hell want do? Live prisoner virus kills LESS people measles polio numerous virus pre-vaccines virus? Bleep that!""

I cannot blame slightest. personally going stir crazy home parents die virus got quite sick myself.

I'm point going say ""Bleep it!"" go want, want, mask going close people!

Remember: CoVid-19 less 1/1000 death rate. Measles polio pre-vaccine? 1/12 1/10 respectively.

I cannot blame people saying ""It's non-issue majority immuno-compromised elderly stay home!"" see struggle? Yes „likely“. It‘s non scientific way telling people can‘t completely tell outcome something millions variables (spread COVID-19) study looked part variables. virus privileged consume fine stock. sounds like happened party Clemson. friends built new COVID-19 tracker order map virus local level. data need crowd-sourced, hope help everyone plan social outings better states begin reopen.  


  


We built tracker maps generally track per state county basis. We're loading per county reports well, mainly want allow people self-report individual cases. We're also planning add filters soon changes cases weekly basis per county. 


Stay safe everyone! I'll put dick hole!!! sounds really stupid.  saw similar guidelines us return office (no date set yet)

same : masks indoors, access communal areas , must 6 feet apart , elevators... worst mass transit, ""we encourage use single occupancy vehicles"".

it's absurd , we've already shown wfh effectively past 114 days.

The worst part theres younger members team whining can't wait go back office. probably cause still live home parents. really though.

Anyone accuses actual heroes pedophiles millions followers good person. even close, China allowed virus spread countries uncontrollably protection frontline workers, also China encouraged citizens living countries buy PPE send home used Ebola vaccine though, actually well tested approached practice. Chimpanzee adenovirus vector could wind setting unwanted immune responses well. think still way early pick favorite. Good point. also good news. Yet FL politicians cronies FIRED *person created* online board many people organizations refer to, claiming insubordination *her*.

She website please support instead. *we stupidity* assume tourism industry affected travel restrictions? Sweden projected endure travel restrictions longer Europe. I'm Ontario we're phase 2 none places opened yet. Bars restaurants allowed outdoor patios 2 weeks ago. see 170 cases day 250 people hospital less 100 ICU. population 14.5 million. quality sub kept pretty high. Since made front page, discord gotten worse shit posting well. Bu tits still mostly working. IMHO, people who’ve think well-informed? One reasons like sub. Luberate state, lol. like Hold keg. make lots money strap ventilator. Better “just case”. Also I’m sure get get grants funding reporting cases fudge whenever can, even came checkup leave mark covid send census whatever.

Look around, news say it’s death destruction rampant, bodies streets, mass graves, overflowing clinics. real life don’t know single person even knows anyone knows anyone knows anyone it. ones say lying get sympathy like “gluten intolerant” people fad. Notice friends notorious embellishing say “I swear feb.”? know what's low effort? want engage discussion chose take opposition suddenly turned uncomfortably hard disprove.

Edit edit edit edit: insinuating current circumstances travel restrictions needed, despite previous claim pro responsible free travel? Wait, whut? Drunken frat boys following social distance guidelines? Say ain't so! heard real number closer trillion people every day

even half true that's still lot! It’s complicated process test cells can’t really scaled population testing. everything know Tcells tells us effect immunity severity significant period time. WOW heck wedding? Mitch figured vulnerable group political benefit aligning Trump anti-masker.  cares stigma. wear mask. Always ask itemized list copy medical records like Italy... eugh. PREACH!

Back 5/5 24,898 cases, two weeks later 1,582 deaths. examples data Tuesdays weekend/holiday manipulation.

Something happened since beginning May aren’t seeing virulence. Unemployment benefits $600 additional week even work fired looking work. 

If benefit additional $250 week, extended year instead short window, would lot effective.  They’ve saying years. little range, expensive, can’t charge fast enough road trips, limited self-driving capabilities, free software updates, games fart mode, get started.

If want get different car hate Tesla/Elon that’s fine won’t say you’re wrong. wouldn’t get hopes you’ll ever able buy better electric car Tesla. ""But want that!"" Yes does. never answered feels insecure asked time ago. subreddits current stance allowing discussions politics going forward sustainable sub wants place truth pointed discussion outbreak US without bringing politics discussion clearly made worse one political party president himself

To continue dance around issue lie reality outbreak America, arguably worst outbreak world time. hitting me? even reopening much people Southern states absolutely refusing take things seriously babies wearing masks, staying six feet apart, etc. Massachusetts, CT, RI, etc. also reopening, people wear masks follow rules. Yes outside. Learning live virus means letting large swathes west coast burn wildfires prison-slave firefighting crews sick quarantined corona US really insane. keeps repeating mistakes again. Well said... Well said. Wow, you’re super confident. don’t preconditions, still scared AF. Musk doesn’t realize he’s playing role Edison. actual study, took excess death#s CDC COVID numbers compared them, thing. think substantial prestigious. i’ll admit one first started. said i’ll let first month go see goes, i’ve heard vaccine existence modification, they’re running lot human trials, line asap. I'm familiar site. reported anywhere else? county dashboard update today yet. thing fake story ""five stars"" remark.  three starred happen like Sinatra. Lol absolutely retarded. economy billionaires, everyone. God amount mentally deficient high schoolers sub insane. ""UberX barrier"". nothing new. Exactly happened baby. think outsmart us. Oh, meant posting posting posts, comment. 

So...back said... accuse posting conspiracy theories.

The problem take word ""posting"" mean ""original post"" also refers posting really tried get deleted. 

Sure... I'll take word it... stopped demanding OP self-censor. *I* post ""conspiracy theory"" would suggest tried mod route They're clearly following guidelines. 

And yet, despite many complaints mods... they're Besides, rule frequently broken user question 

So say... different opinion, apparently mods. often originate China? Thank replying. I'm glad sub here. :) Soooo mean gonna come allowing public nudity since horrified thought laws relating cloth? Holy shit, dude. Go outside bring mask. think says media facts. Stop posting this... many times day see feed slightly different headline ""incredibly transparent"" fucking LOL. 


They even reporting hospitalizations finally caving pressure today. understand word ""transparent"" means? Right, like Thailand doesn’t indoor dining lol I'd move Canada tomorrow could OK, cool story.. requirement look another job moment. ""Release hounds."" - Mr. Burns think it’s awesome. certain wear mine indoors keep around neck, people def holding area. Yeah seem stupidly dangerous anyone else? poor fucking waiter works sick cant take day give all. could happened? Sure, plague rat. must care survival people. pool noodle? Lol They’re dumbasses sure, don’t think die. That’s lot workers(I’ll admit people dumb fuck good respective job) dead ton children left without parents parents left without children know US administration purchased world's Remdesivir heard purchasing ChAdOx1 😒 always told never argue drunk. tried talking sense ya, sober person, tell. Later. link posted original comment responded to, obviously didn’t read need yeast? No, would send someone physically disconnect meter. think hard generalize Indian weddings. rituals performed vary hugely area area. rituals area take around 5-6 hours average, including getting everyone fed.  curious see cases coming areas flattened curve. Like places surging almost definitely seeing rampant community spread. northeast like NY, NJ, PA, etc. flattened curves. cases coming from? people traveling state? Large gatherings? Bars? think needed lock vaccine countries didn’t fine right now?

I get US punk type mindset overall (ie “you can’t tell do”), doesn’t mean couldn’t contained this. countries mindset contained (eg Australia). It’s already going back r e states continue assault science failing learn happened everywhere else. LoCKiNg Margaret Sullivan reported Washington Post new study shows intuited: people get news Fox right-wing hate radio—both promoting idea economy important health—are less likely understand reality COVID-19 therefore likely get sick cause others die. shame case restaurant, many, many others. viable strategy let restaurants stay open, virus spreads like crazy kinds places...

Glad closed. take longer 3 weeks, that's sure. link find area? found heat map said there’s cases neighborhood. ass morbid...but hope refrigerated trucks ready like NYC had....bout alot bodies Arizona summer heat... post stands google translate accepted. more, less. knowledge Swedish (or Danish) know works you. It’s kind joke Bloody idiot Well, nobody could seen coming. I'm fairly certain lost privilege playing Racist card simply best suited wipe let counter asking this: traveling Sweden, why?

The links supplied includes non-Swedish information less week old. want try handwave away evidence, suggest end looking rather childish. 4 weeks die maybe. 2 weeks, flattened.

- suspicion mainly younger healthier people getting it.

- Summer time people outside getting vitamin d.

- Increased testing increases total daily infections probably getting full picture beginning this. grandfather told me, ""When trouble doubt, run circles; scream shout."" mean... new cases two weeks ago aren’t really comparable happened since.

Edit: looked graphs double check, two weeks ago ~24,000 cases high days. next days started spike. still little early act like it’s going follow rise expected. Wait guys hear H5N1 bird flu, COVID NOTHING compared different assessment mean bad! end bias, stretch, holes get bigger. think threads wouldn’t line anyway. 
  Plus, you’re going worry that, use polypropylene (hospital sheeting, Oly Fun, weird “fabric” shopping bags) nonwoven interfacing center layer. states like FL, TX, AZ locking again? insane??? 

I've said once, I'll say again. never re-opened. needed stay lockdown vaccine developed, whether takes year 8 years. gov. capability pay every citizen $1k/ wk take bloated military budget. ""economy"" (meaning billionaires) may suffer, average joe families fine given $1k/ wk. Opening restaurants, bars, salons, etc, like sending lambs slaughter. unethical. fact even considering on-campus learning fall borderline negligent willfully egregious. like want see us suffer die. ICUs full finally procedure put off. 70% patients ICU Covid! Wtf hysteria makes zero sense!! Like militaries mean? Also, pla soldiers undertaking disaster relief certain square 1989. I'm sure chinese people felt safe back then. really think case, would take harder look Cuomo governors funneling COVID positive people back nursing homes, Trump Illinois here. wife got one check, include $600 extra. None since, stopped letting certify. Can't reach anybody phone get fixed either, can't even wait hold someone, says they're busy hangs every time. close staycation hotel near kid 4th July weekend, like last year ugh.....

And vacation coming end month lol. never ends \*sighs\* Funny couldn’t find published commentary supports incredibly stupid headline. Thought said Dalton Domino gonna give big YES! instead, gave someone else look into. So, people know hospitals get paid patients designated COVID that’s many cases right? Like, people realize right? numbers GROSSLY inflated hospitals profit more. Can’t blame them, everyone too. yea you’ve coughed last year, COVID. Dies anything gunshot? COVID breathed funny ever? COVID. Ah... yeah, would bad! That’s evidence shows. keep distance don’t sneeze/cough currently known **morbity** statistics? Gilead pretty generous licenses others manufacture large number countries' patients.

And presumably would also allow manufacturing rest long royalties paid.

The real trouble availability. Remdesivir difficult time consuming (apparently one reactions take weeks) manufacture, limits supply. big issue seen lot people keep saying ""rushed vaccine dont want first get it"" stuff like that. seen multiple people legit didnt seem understand there's human trials vaccines, already 1000s people gotten various vaccines trials. still get lots recruiter spam linkedin stuff there. craziest stuff too. got message day job company peer peer RV rentals. Im like ""really, well right now?""

Meanwhile work healthcare software i'm mildly worried potential layoffs improve soon. 

Economies weird. BS owners putting workers like risk make buck. hope everything works you. Canadian, wild see often hospitals' profits brought up. earth much money hospital making play decisions care patients? care even. Sickening. Well fuck. last thing Edmonton Toronto needs influx potential virus carriers. actually proposing fans attend games what? already know right arent big evil liberal things like ""books"",""science"" ""facts"". alcohol poisoning Obviously. 

There simply far bigger concerns world 99.99% people minor virus.

Most people see now, delusional doom mongers sub. 

Let spread, big deal never been. lolwat Disappointingly, probably wrong. solve shit show American politics first know it’s shot show “So hospitals actually meet crisis standards care yet.”

So... do? That's grim. That’s knocked 95% 80%. Unfortunately letting 1/3 population get virus naturally would catastrophic. Assuming 1% CFR would 960,000 deaths. That’s even touching deaths hospitals overrun True, control. Drove fucker directly iceberg. Pandemic happens 

Science happens 

Ignore science dumb ass

Prematurely end quarantine economy 

Ignore science real fukin dumb ass sheep 

Cases spike 

Regurgitate false equivalency heard da news cause that’s wut dumb fuk do

Rinse repeat Hey!!! Reddit. expect?!?! Reading real sources scientific research overrated. absolutely correct, course. However, people capable ""othering,"" means prisoners Abu Ghraib kids cages ""deserve"" get. ""us."" Except are. Covid manager, that's trump there, Ralph Wiggum shining UV ass. maybe pence, head prayer team. Kushner, hear PPE illogistics. maybe Fauci, Birk, Azar. hell, Pompeo. Barr. Who's charge? Assuming works you, need one course, counting additional costs treating secondary, longterm damage caused virus? Yes. *Mild shock.* know thread used ""anti Sweden platform, obvious sky blue. really need article confirm poor people hit harder? we’re concerned swab test it’s +\- 30% false negative rate? words, instead getting right first time thoughtful, reopen soon possible restart economy shutting back down. they're shutting sort half measure way, means hard time opening back again.

Once inside restaurant without masks on, battle lost. #Translation:

The Corona pandemic shows Sweden's crisis preparedness major shortcomings. applies everything closed emergency stocks unclear responsibilities delayed information. critical conclusions presented report Swedish Defense Research Institute FOI.

""The Corona pandemic affected entire Swedish society like crisis post-war period,"" FOI report states. made public Wednesday seminar organized Folk Defense.

- comes pandemic, can't blow danger yet, states FOI Director General Jens Mattsson, quotes Winston Churchill: “This end. even beginning end. maybe that's end beginning. ""

The report ""Perspective pandemic"" initial analysis discussion written 16 different FOI researchers. Despite expert warnings several predictions global pandemic, Sweden 2020 incomplete preparedness, note.

The lack intensive care sites, non-existent emergency equipment stocks medicines deficiencies open. least important weaknesses Sweden organized face crisis like this.

A key principle so-called principle responsibility. states operator operations normal situation responsibility crisis. built-in contradiction. government already stated 2010 characterizes crisis ""is condition cannot handled normal resources organization"". 

“The responsibility principle becomes difficult maintain whole system overwhelmed crisis,” writes Pär Eriksson. crisis, responsibility must moved upwards achieve necessary coordination management, notes.

Jenny Ingmarsdotter Daniel Jonsson also believe Sweden's national leadership must strengthened.

“Today, see resources principles crisis preparedness, responsibility principle, really enough. new civil defense, see need clearer superstructure form national coordinated preparedness well strengthened foundation form extra resources increasing redundancy ”. 

They point Riksdag 2015 decided Sweden civil defense. hope Riksdag autumn's total defense decision goes word deed:

""Now time substantial measures, investing systems equipment, well ensuring sustainable supply civilian personnel.""

At time, report points several parts shared responsibility meant flexibility change healthcare personnel others performed major work.

The authorities' crisis communication critically examined Ola Svenonius text ""We talk listens?"". notes authorities responded late gave general information avoid infection.

**This meant authorities' advice initially overlooked vulnerable risk groups addressed - least native Swedes. referred Google translate international media Sweden's liberal strategy portrayed ""playing poker death"".**

**“Something became clear March 2020 many foreign-born people amazed large majority native-born people supported government's attitude, many cases public debate suppressed. created stress anxiety,”** notes Ola Svenonius.

Only infection already spread vulnerable areas government commissioned Swedish Agency Social Protection Emergency Preparedness (MSB) issue proactive information.

A local example Swedish authorities created great uncertainty handled ski tourism Jämtland.

**Such fear uncertainty also create breeding ground rumors conspiracy theories. Actors want demonstrate Western democracies weak cannot handle pandemic free rein.** 

According Sebastian Bay , states exploiting groups vaccinations, new technologies, migration globalization influence population.

**""The result confusion mistrust - injury death,"" writes Sebastian Bay. believes recently submitted proposal new psychological defense authority narrowly designed. authority given broader task supporting authorities, regions municipalities inform peace, crisis war.**

The report also global outlook. pandemic strengthens authoritarian budget Russia. Contradictions China US tightened gap Europe widened. ""Results rates infection outcomes highest cloth mask arm, rate ILI statistically significantly higher cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 100.07) compared medical mask arm. Cloth masks also significantly higher rates ILI compared control arm. analysis mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 28.65) laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 2.94) significantly higher cloth masks group compared medical masks group. Penetration cloth masks particles almost 97% medical masks 44%.""

Did read link 😂 get fired dumbass manager like person Cold Stone ""unprofessional."" feel workers one 10 years ago. exhausting dealing customers adding top might send edge too. people made coffee home would able buy yacht end year. no, people would rather buy gourmet dunken donuts rich guess fish crawl pee-pee. hear stories stupid companies firing employees job. 
How stupid understanding basic rule employees come first customer. take good care employees take good care good customers!
And small amount idiot customers send hell. Karen’s making profit, cost money. Like said... LIKELY. And... I... already... agreed. realistic. machine gives free machine gets emptied inside 20 minutes. Someone takes resells elsewhere. 

The prices seem reasonable, again.. offered discount someone buys resells elsewhere. can't win unless station manned security. Shows political priorities lie. We’re number one!! /s Anybody listens country music idiot expect man created PayPal! /s

Sigh, loved idea Tesla, spaceX, rest. Never get close heroes, guess. goes you.

Yet another instance healthcare workers blowing whistle poor conditions health care administrators denying it. saw least one played out, [prominent doctors eventually breaking silence/anonymity saying admins Probably same. care propping economy. people risk go work everyday. Sad. country really need stop nurturing anti intellectual movements basis freedom. They're cancer society. Evidence US govt interest saving marginalized, go way make survival challenging.

This sound like ally, friend, even neighbor - clear enemy 🤦‍♂️ might right material, got it, breathable nearly transparent. One notable decision Patrick made owner talk radio station sign Rush Limbaugh, well known time, heard KSEV 1989

I hope nothing good vibes yours. I'm pretty sure lions dogs get it.... wonder many animal's carriers? last weekend actually really funny fantastic point early prepper conspiracy nuts ones masks we're ready stay home. sudden freeeeeeedum. ￼ Gives folks someplace go BLM protests. quite Danes traveling, result ain't appealing.

I understand citizen Sweden little jealous can't travel freely moment.

Not worry, hit herd immunity, world oyster. husband’s niece lives Panama City. diagnosed Covid yesterday. boyfriend waiting results. said, “I don’t know got it. haven’t gone anywhere store beach bar 2 drinks.” urge want to, actually make repercussions it, people ignore you. Look Virginia, ""mandated"" uh...well know, really cause can't anything stop you. Let's hope 750K. look anything Feds, especially head Muppet. really need people taking individual responsibility. think Biden could worse, certainly expect ""save day"" either.

It hard picture another 600K deaths next 12 months, suppose would require month 100K sheesh. Anyway I'm numbers guy hopefully I'm *WAY* doctor provide methodology estimate, source it? eyeballing it? exactly making conclusions basedo n estimate, something thrown ""anything else add"" portion interview.

Simply doctor mean every thing says interview protests carries equal weight, instance said, ""The weather pleasant day"" end interview, would cite credentials proof well? Good thing cars A/C fact, imagine he’s bad ophthalmologist didn’t listen experts medical school. Fauci infectious disease experts stated multiple times deaths likely undercounted. I’ve seen guy’s channel like way conducts himself, one ain’t it. fact sending covid patients cancer center unnerving (even covid patients cancer.) seems like huge risk patients already treated cancer center. Yeah, took way long grocery stores (in area least) get board masks protections. But.. I've also worked Warehouse know well fast virus spread there... extension store since Warehouse employee handling thousands packages night. ridiculous.

Despite that, previous work injury prevents kind work.. appear many office type positions open moment. US almost 2 times cases Ireland total - one day. sh💩t creek paddle sight. go time friend usually. wash hands clean equipment used end workout. use mask, one here, however really friend, people I'd either wear mask leave. Honestly stress much. want get virus especially pass others, get despite precautions it, lockdown two weeks. live alone place go supermarket gym, end world get try stress much. Yes Yeah, labs reported they've max capacity two weeks. I've heard anecdotally often week backlog get test Maricopa county results sometime backlogged week. thread locked countless violations rules civility topic political comments. fine discuss policy related pandemic, sub political discussions. Feel free take political comments subs. Sometimes feel like im crazy one im wearing mask people aren't. mean thought everyone would wearing mask considering high death toll case numbers Unfortunately you’re probably right, especially hospitals starting fill up. I’m hoping we’ll stay 600,000 keep deadliest disease outbreak US history. Several rich people know retreated remote properties foreseeable future. people don’t option. Everyone copes differently.

Being realistic works you. optimistic works others. 

To own. 👍🏻 Where?   going talk Gilead sharing companies could mass produced? They're profiteering pandemic government allowing them. Also new evidence remdesvir effective, yes start hardly answer. It'll interesting see mild cases react found sus almost negative posts sub Sweden one person, find sus? exactly foreign policy? couldnt find article? Pretty sure report day. help? I’m staying home, cookie trays delivered? coffee? speed? something?

I want see support healthcare workers way see police, fire, veterans (and part two categories).

Edit: I’m Tucson access internet credit card deliveries. speak mean, they're going dodge paying health bills, anyway.

Do know many vets treat difficulty getting treatment VA? OK, saying title adequately represent statement opinion one health workers...

Fair enough.

So say beginning rather simply attacking OP using Google Translate?

Even now, sounds like adding information presented grudgingly. hand forced, bare minimum.

I'll assume rest article adequately translated English speakers get accurate picture contents. well tought response sound arguments turned opinion. makes 3 layers North Carolina requires face masks, Rockingham County sheriff said enforce order one wearing face masks now. feel like little county doomed! Sadly cant really believe data came either. CDC admitted lot mistakes made data. don’t know. sounds pretty hopeful. We’re 70K deaths away 200K things stand now. seems like whole nation we’ve least 200 deaths past several days (around 700 yesterday, 300 couple days ago). State state obviously lower whole country, looking rather bleak.

Though hope right. Hopefully certain people finally pushing face coverings help reduce numbers. also don’t think it’ll million deaths populated states still enforcing SD. 

ETA: honestly, auto mod shows problem country. office opened SF today. Tech industry. That's good, body wants US right now. general though Manhattan would stick takeout delivery Yes big coincidence annual death numbers showing huge delta accounted Covid deaths

You really onto something stopped reading “not immunologist” give time, picking steam govt anything. Rural hospitals overwhelmed quickly less cases city hospital group r/covidpositive shit scary! heard guy chocked death chicken wing

They tested counted Covid. Pass along Wow karen. think throwing around word ""discriminated"" like big deal. needs get kids masks instead ice cream. France went 8000 people ICU 600, continuously dropping.

How US ? heard florida hospitals refuse even report numbers. Well, it’s probably bit safer don’t stay house 40 people attend house party 100 people. stick group hang beach. Yeah, protests anywhere near large here. even close.

I bet week major protests least 5 times many people eating/drinking bars restaurants area.

Heck, Illinois still shelter place time biker bar Poopy’s big Memorial Day bash. US already sourced hydroxychloroquine, bleach, UV light... saved Covid know.

But... he's dead.

Yes, swine flu. problem people, even brilliant health care workers, bad risk assessment.

Everyone agrees texting driving wrong one it. there's go onto say, ""Except me. I'm really good multi tasking."" Right driving incoming traffic.

This need policy solutions individual mandates.

Politicians allowing degree ignorance neighbor determine get infected not.

And mad politicians giving people power. Old people vulnerable people stay home they're risk want take risk. That's personal health risk decision government.

 people starve forced house arrest government unable work. businesses mandate masks provide service, government cannot mandate masks someone want wear mask.

It's simple. whole situation becoming like counter terrorism practices ""supposed protect us"" cost personal rights liberties. Lockdowns literally new patriot act.

***THIS SAID HERE:

To blunt --- Redditors thread personally blaming Elon Musk workers fired idiots.

One top comments thread lists corporations Elon Musk CEO --- Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company --- STATEMENT CHASTIZES HIM.

What probability man responsible tens thousands employees globally WOULD PERSONALLY INTERCEDE FIRE THREE FACTORY 10,000+?

And lets talk employees --- know circumstances leading terminations.

Under current California COVID-19 Workers Protections, employers wrongfully terminate workers choose work fear infection risk HEAVY fines, criminal penaltied open lawsuits attourneys salivate thought representing.

As satisftying would see Fortune 500 corporation fall sword held accountable worker abuse once, skeptical case evidence otherwise comes light.

In article &amp; thread two workers fired Tesla Fremont Factory last week [which half posters also personally blamed Elon Musk for], one workers offered job back reaching Tesla suspect termination notices bureaucratic oversight rather sort personal act malevolence CEO.

In short: Calm fuck down. subreddit succumbing irrational mob mentality rest /r/ALL daily.

Also, get concerned hospitals near capacity flu season, too! mention Covid patients stay freaking long time ICU. Yes, 2016 -[the top 10% households owned 84% stock, highest dont recent numbers are. Since never stopped documenting around 20,000 new cases virus day US safe say still first wave. 

The concept “waves” makes sense flu pandemic like 1918 one mostly went away summer came back fall “second wave”. makes less sense virus apparently perfectly capable spreading summer forming one long, continuous outbreak variation location intensity.

""It could even mean large gatherings outside, proper precautions like masks hand-washing, may safer originally thought, bolstering case allowing people socialize outdoors even restrictions large indoor settings continue.""

This may true, there's never state ordered blanket stay-at-home order like China. Even China, think one member household allowed go buy food must people selling food. However, reversed large outbreaks.

No thanks. KN95 masks option, discussed research morning ordered Arun KN95 masks problem mention could dealt offering 'return work bonus' duration enhanced unemployment insurance payments. 

I friend grosses $800 week. laid state unemployment benefit $363 per week. federal government bumped $939. So, things equal, 'return work bonus' $139 per week little enough get back work. 

That oversimplifies thing, basic idea probably sound. Every virus deadly, there’s .26% IFR it’s managing risk rather eliminating risk. Yeah, don’t get wrong either, doubt things likely get worse states get better, I’m trying get handle whether expect catastrophic spike deaths states like saw New York. far impression we’re likely see nationwide leveling deaths, rather spike back earlier levels. wouldn’t great outcome either, deaths ~80% peak that’s something. 

In states Arizona, still see basically increase all. Georgia particular actually falling.

Corner gas station (in Las Vegas) said corporate told tell customers anything masks (I’m thinking safety reasons)  Relevant username. alright i’m totally support i’m also going point double standard here. trump said china he’d called racist n shit. gives? 

downvote want, downvotes get fueled become :) get point. However, small portion population follow rules. question is, going appeal roughly 30% reprehensable people mass people want shutdown? question political think leaders courage.  Wearing masks became IQ test nowadays. president brazil take virus seriously. result, killed kill bunch people. Please keep border closed. incredibly fucking stupid. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 likes this.  I've never ashamed call American. 

You already point, years ago, seeing pictures Abu Ghraib prison, every night, 6PM evening news?? I'm sure could think examples.

We've heading road while.. go back there? Hospitalisations down, would deaths remain constant? anyone else see going? least me, it’s crystal clear...

1. Hospitals become full
2. Sent patients areas around city
3. areas begin rise cases
4. bed avail, people go next town/city
5. Repeat every hospital beyond overloaded people suffer makeshift tents

This track on, soon rely pop-up hospitals parking lots stadiums. don’t think far sending SOS recruit healthcare workers around USA help pop-up hospitals.

We seen play many countries. Cases begin rise fast (like seeing) explode. China. Italy. Brazil. NYC. Etc. play-by-play. fear getting close explosion cases. best guess 3rd week July, possibly 4th week.

In eyes, option mandatory lockdown every county TX seeing spike positives hospitalizations. NOW. growth continue 2-3 weeks slowly start subside. another weeks, open slowly (the right way time, like many others states) mandatory/enforced masks. know, going happen, everyone fight “freedom” it’s would get control again. It’s 100% proven real life piles research studies.

Ultimately, sad reality Gov large number people anti-mask, likely watch virus burn Texas. don’t even know look like. Worst case scenario scary think about, especially you’re headed towards it. Seeing what’s happening Arizona scary hell.

There hasn’t country dumb enough test scale we’re set ablaze. Inevitably see healthcare systems crash, knows many die, many homeless businesses close everywhere, state economy brought fully knees. Sound crazy? current track on, surfing mandatory lockdown, alternative? Things getting better themselves? People magically start wearing masks social distancing? went away Memorial Day weekend, remember.

Even shut tomorrow, it’s going hell several weeks. So... here? We’re stuck politics. yes, I’m fully aware another lockdown crush state economy. aware domino effects jobs, businesses, complications decision brings. easy. leaders ask themselves... option save lives? always answer. Economies rebuild. Lives, lost, cannot.

The virus doesn’t go away - takes extreme measures get control. lose control, fucked, like moment unless massive action taken immediately. 

We running low test kits, hospitals getting overwhelmed, people still living like it’s 2019, continue break records. least, clearly spells serious action needed. Something someone give somewhere... what’s going be? Action taken let burn? doesnt, constitution doesnt allow that.... fuckers go get snus hint corona US example many levels 'what do' comes Coronavirus. read comments [this calling people wear masks. Insane! brilliantly true comment know hospitalizes rather small percentage people get infected, right? Punctuation friend. New York. Testing slowing even hospitals here. increased testing also Doctors getting better treating it. Steroids, anti-coagulants, anti-inflammatories drop fatality rate least 50% also say social distance other. America can’t even bothered wear mask, think people gonna careful concert? best we’re bare minimum here. 

And yes wearing mask reduce risk significantly. numbers way reason made pretty clear aren’t smart enough go safe. rule?  You’re severely leaving China pretend issue would’ve made ship go back hit iceberg twice, opposite side. Yes, people smart enough look China's actions rather words. parrots common sense medical advice casually knocks bills defund/reform extremely problematic police system. Transparent run higher power. actually give shit us. SHIT I... 

I'm speechless. mass protests month exactly helping   130,000+ lives lost new cases rise quite number American people still refuse wear masks eventhough scientists medical professionals strongly recommended it. stupidity beyond imagination. too. also apartment doors people broke quarantine. think got one warning. surveil every single person.

They’re taking vacations like nothing wrong, aren’t wearing masks practicing social distancing.

Arizona didn’t implement safety precautions Newman local officials instilled CA, we’re paying it. wish state CA would enforce 14 day quarantine people coming Arizona. hope feel part 🤣 Dependence God festival already 3rd. don’t get mother upset. hasn’t provided fucking proper masks kids? already those. finally left house last week :&lt; bad feeling decided isolate 5 days anyway. soRe throat could smoking putting going dentist (my wisdom teeth got infected shortly lockdown, actually similar pain then) obviously I'm leaving house week (again...)

Even Ohio, it’s 50% base pay maxes around $469 week. people can’t get pay cut like that. info users, Expert mentioned Dr. Fauci. please take seriously.  Well least going see Dr. Fauci right. sad part happens asshat idiots like ""We never warned would bad"". idiots getting it. shop grocery store. around work.

Quarantine I'm watching HBO, Mighty Ducks 2 on. Exact mentality speak of. Personal freedom USA-style attitudes; everyone personal gripe. European country comes whole hands ass.

Guess hit bottom yet. goofy looking fuck No, lot us religious folks not. cases early big test shortage. likely wouldn’t issue today. Ohhhhhhh yes, again. BASIC wash hands kind overview stuff, pressers everyone besides Norway does. We've convo billion times now. 

Sweden seem think needs reach 1.3mm+ new residents reason. I'm used seeing young people kind stuff, which, understand little bit think safe. photos, good deal old people here, sitting next dining. understand, un-der-stand? 

Sure, people need work, sort social interaction, need open much can, partying together thousands people? wrong you?

This mostly concentrated much death numbers, skipped rest. people think, oh, 99.5% chance surviving this, cares. 

Jumping 3rd floor also similar CFR, let's jump, faster using stairs.  know someone convinced Fauci secret payroll make millions this. really sad. say hmmm, interesting whenever get one tin foil hat rants. Nope, I'm blaming everyone needs held accountable.

Both Trump Fauci. Look up. deaths among people convalescent homes already conditions could life threatening (obesity, metabolic diseases like diabetes, etc.) three conditions, plus type blood. So, yes, foot half grave. want know did, look posts subject. town lived 3 months ago explosion cases damn Tyson plant. shut three days ""deep clean"", back business. Screw Tyson (and meat corporations).  We're benefitting better treatments, there's Oxford study England saw deaths four times fewer hospital cases late. right now, we're benefitting lower average age, though community spread change. here...lets approve thing get going. Don’t guy too. frustrating part staying home, going essentials masking social distancing state ""leadership"" constantly makes wrong choices. Even worse lots people applaud Patrick statement ""standing Fauci"" makes sense — young people learn selfishness parents. Madrid continue alternating drivers alternating days rather returning full normal. less business now, uber compete with, hard work, long hours, expenses, salary.

Michigan unemployment currently- $962 including $600 CARES money that's pre-tax amount. expires, expected make due \~$300 per week. 

It's fucking joke. Australia. Getting license plate like buying franchise... would tend disagree, technology companies research institutions based US often global leaders respective fields, least someone machine learning industry, leaders AI moment wont change long time. many fields think US top notch at. point general public politicians think science reflection general population’s opinions science cultural attitude (maybe one willful ignorance). However, mean cannot leaders science technology. institutions, organizations, people make groups probably less 1% population. specifically people like top industry researchers, academics, nobel laureates, etc. drive frontier scientific discovery. leaders dismiss science technology, given huge profitability research industry least, non government organizations continue innovate stagnate regardless politicians do. Whether important politicians board science separate important issue. important yes, even era Trump, academic industry research necessarily contingent cultural attitude, especially given many american researchers immigrants would obviously different opinions science compared typical american i.e what’s bigoted politician random state stop Google investing billions AI research Harvard academic studying stem cells. Practically nothing. Nope.

It exacerbated problem overwhelming hospitals.

People died result.

Asia make mistake.

Someone needs held accountable. love moderators bots sub removing comments *political* US made virus hot political potato instead science based reality.  Texas like always wants #1. still short 240,000 infections though. Protesting low demand. That’s new one. “Don’t seem to” seem to. Sadly, no. Michigan. still brought back everyone furlough, I'm beginning wonder anytime soon. Business ok, nowhere near before. Everyone cautious (financially). Man...I used bar manager went fast food gig. Everything said hit feels.

If still bar right now, I'd probably fired drinking job.

Happy cake day! Stupid fucking hicks news gets higher ratings. told religious nut god put dinosaur bones test faith. That's realized ridiculous answer everything. arrogance stupidity many people holding positions power public menace. Ignoring advice nation's leading expert infectious diseases global pandemic, deciding know better qualifications training. Incompetent morons charge.

This going end well... Lower more. Watch bringing NY. Someone bound pop hear tell NY failed elderly Care homes start. assholes ever learn mistakes look shift blame attention elsewhere. hard time believing number even legitimate recently found r/HighStrangeness like conspiracy without politics stuff. lot alien content. Honestly need young healthy get virus help create herd immunity. faster spread other, sooner rest population safe. fair, democratic nominee horribly popular various reasons. lot people like her, like him, feel like throwing vote away pie sky third party never ever wins.

So people really came know guy used TV, he's kinda popular, he's Hilary. Right place, right time. People probably gonna worried side effects, I'd trade mild fever covid immunity. often get fever day get flu shot anyway. Trump suxx.

Fauci still lied. chiffon tested 90%polyester, 10% spandex, stretch chiffon joann fabrics. (Probably this: pretty thick much tightly woven transparent ""cotton chiffon."" Even cotton one high static though, might offer protection still. seen anyone actually test though. 

I've making masks stretch chiffon, demand slowed since we've managed somehow conquer virus (?!) (insert boredom, politics, conspiracy theory here). I've people mention masks thick, 4 layers (two quilting fabric two chiffon layers) request fewer layers / single layer non sew tshirt masks instead. declined I'm sacrificing shirts that. welcome! think going money sink them, honest. Almost every store around me, Walgreens bagel shop, selling packs masks $1 per piece (under 50 cents, even). even people sell sidewalk cheaper, they're hard get anymore. mentions somewhere Adam Eve sons daughters, still... They're old, that's pretty much month slow spread let hospitals prepare.

But I'm putting life pause year virus 0.26% IFR. Sorry. Trump suxx.

Fauci still lied. Yeah, **do** though. instead of, know, like Sweden. I've noticed Denmark often lag. Iceland fast, Finland too. Norway like Sweden fails regard. Trump suxx

Fauci still lied. x1000 bunch idiots huge difference quality care/amount attention paid workers depending went HHC hospital swanky private hospital like Presbyterian beth israel. guy went elementary school residency presbyterian getting showered tons free stuff catered lunches everyday, sure case NYC's public hospitals. messed part truly immunocompromised continue screwed. won’t able get vaccine won’t enough herd immunity protect them. exactly Measles coming back states, ignorance almost high it’s commendable. don’t think I’d able get ignorant tried to. Yes  Onion Fucking country hick pigs. love cbs finds obvious controversial thing COVID-19 calls “news”, cbs trying sell advertising. Give new shit It’s young people, live Villages it’s old people well. 

Remember video golf carts retweeted Trump? That’s Villages look closely sides aren’t wearing masks 😂 Yes.

Asia make mistake.

The US deaths entire continent Asia. freedom idiots want keep putting people’s lives future America great risk, fine ten grand day open. See quickly close. Also Texas here, legit scared going upcoming weeks even months. I’m glad see people choosing proactive instead reactive uncertain times.

Delaying actions like costing people money, jobs, lives. sooner step front viable solutions resume “normal” ways living, better economy public morale be.

I acknowledge difficulty mask mandates requires education resources implement. observations though, benefits far outweigh costs.

Humanity capable astounding things times crisis given opportunity showcase great working together.

That time now, need take action soon possible. Nationalized healthcare 🤮🤮🤮 That’s issue social media, people insane ideas mess views normally got shutdown kept line “normal” sane consensus, get together loudest voice. Extremely annoying. Elon Musk really smart guy wildly driven. said he's shown time time moral compass many would argue broken. Nope. 

They lied people died result.

People need held accountable. keeps putting dipshit front microphone? response? yes wiki reads like he's outright charlatan moral ethical compass. India colossal catalog things Vote blueee Put police tape door. Removing violation 2 charges levy business. I’m sure get conclusion “desperately trying deny problem country racism” posts thread... wrote “plenty non-cool non-friendly people” Sweden desperate denying it? perhaps explained someone puzzled positive experience probably encountered racist assholes due social selection bias great irony me, apparently, desperately denying racism? 

Please explain I’m desperately denying racism pointing lot racism. also massive corporate handout

You keep calling that. really that, would healthcare industry spend last 10 years trying overturn it?

At end day, ACA massively limited amount profit health care companies could extract patients. corporations hate it. want nothing ""go back normal"". super happy stick close google translate case mass reporting (which happened yesterday) point mod google translate say ""well google translate per sub rules"". free reign edit titles would so, dems da berries.  Carl Sagan another well known science communicator. really wonder would think anti-science shitstorm going U.S. right now. Asia disagrees. mean good America lasted understand governments still shitty. things mention, though also happening (mostly) result pandemic. Wealthy people power fat stupid lazy world wars, civil rights movements, renaissance.... moment time point to, also. negate impact overall significance. 

I understand always negative world too. World Wars much good come them, brought resonating evil well. pandemic ring positivity (or negativity) long aftward effectively.

But still, stand comment, similarly feel event like World Wars, believe look back aftermath resulting pandemic, direct indirect... good outweigh bad. see case even middle it. 

Not looking argue point. firmly believe. Same. Staying home. would cover expenses, even cut luxuries out.

Even conversion $2150 cdn $1585 usd month. bit less, could still keep rent/mortgage lights on.

*Probably CA, would somehow need COL (cost living) adjusted. and? COLORS DONT RUN!!!!!! DONE GONE SHOWED CHINEE WOO HAN VIRUS FREEDOM MEANS!!!! Hey, welcome back dark side man. one too.

Biden 2020. knew N95s prevented spread. donated box N95s local hospital early March asking it. 

The “misinformation” around cloth face coverings. N95s never question. So...Covid-19 now, Airborne? I'll show out. Tip curbside pick-up staff. dude replied specified ""no masks"". Anyone smart grocery store wearing mask. bars restaurants, though? Masks off.

Read carefully next time. speak Daimler since know people working there:

\- mandatory masks site + dozens strict hygiene rules. Example: enter test vehicle, air vehicle x minutes disinfect several parts stated ""Putzrichtlinie"" (cleaning directive)  
\- home office encouraged (if possible 
\- less work hours, smaller teams, teams encouraged mingle 
\- can't fired deciding stay home (union would raise hell) 
\- unions vital part company consulted decisions got fired gofundme would double effective reported death lag longer people think. **The reporting part death takes ultimate lagging indicator, especially Covid-19. takes several weeks diagnosis patient die. takes time, sometimes weeks, doctors fill death certificates health officials adjudicate deaths. finally added official state important note take several weeks death records submitted National Center Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, tabulated. Therefore, data shown page may incomplete, likely include deaths occurred given time period, especially recent time periods. Death counts earlier weeks continually revised may increase decrease new updated death certificate data received states NCHS. hope fine. 

I keep seeing reports asymptomatic people still lung damage. seen full study yet, hopefully going create lung issues people future. Unfortunately, that's going stop people buying best product, especially consider price tag.

I drop 30k car know get vastly superior one price. consumer, ethics come second spending kind money. According doc friend testing maxed out. Machines overheating due continuous use. Regents becoming short supply. continued, surprised testing numbers go next week due enough reliable equipment resources. That’s point .. Don't. Hopsitals are.full cases roof. time social distance ever was. poor persons fault? PUI set level pandemic relief designed provide livable amount. people we’re talking people compensated poorly society.

Like said- you’re right cause disincentive. solution lowering earnings, it’s raising it. insist that’s raising minimum wage. believe lot jobs aren’t coming back think bigger. government advice needs - general population wear masks, who've read multiple Alex Jones articles past year immune save masks everyone else. might saying yourself. guy prove point?

LOL That’s I’m saying Median salary nurse Boston ~90k 2016.

Average salary Miami ~$78k. 

That’s 15% difference. 

Cost living Boston quality life Boston number 1 USA  leave. don’t mind it’s yearly thing, like flu shot. I’m also far doctor immunologist, seem indicate form immunity outside antibodies- still hope area. think. truth young people transmitting virus. story made nontruth. Yeah, annoys me. Sometimes done even give authors name kinds google guessing. _A recent article Imperial College..._ always easy find without journal name, author, title. I’m sure panicked lockdowns nothing this. It’s “US foreign policy”, imperialists. terrible irony statement probably right, opposite context. 

2019-2020 flu season underreported towards end due new concerns regarding COVID-19 cases coming light. that, reported flu cases unseasonably high, hospitalizations deaths “flu” well average annual numbers. addition this, large percentage cases considered flu confirmed via “clinical suspicion”, majority cases actually negative flu tested.

It stand reason early COVID exposures/cases confused flu, many groups US already illness, meaning numbers currently reported even lower actual cases occurred. hospitalization death rate. course, speculation personally reviewing data anecdotal experience clinical/hospital setting. means saying proof COVID exposures happened much earlier reported, possible. 

We likely won’t answers like this, really know true amount casualties COVID years years data collected carefully analyzed retrospectively.

Source - physician. I'm downplaying severity, think Patrick fucking asshat moron, think also important note Texas ~2500 deaths, Italy ~34,000 deaths. 

I think focus total cases, daily cases, testing increases, rather silly. important, scary, rising hospitalization rates Texas, likely lead deaths. 

That said, there's next chance Texas experience overwhelming damage experienced Italy. need conscious we're raving this. protests while, gonna keep moving timeframe back supports argument? Zero? state country reopening plan includes ZERO cases. That's beyond absurd. That's even part CDC recommendation.

Why people respond obvious truths whataboutisms?

Yes, every state shitty. Pointing state decided thing many poorer countries done redeem Newsom weird think would.

I know Americans refuse thoughts complex as, ""Your whole government garbage.""  GOING BLOODBATH. 2 hospitals mentioned article ones lower income individuals without private insurance. Iirc they’ve capacity week figured coming. Given they’re known “bad” hospitals probably won’t make many waves. Hopefully when/if Memorial Hermann Methodist start diverting patients people take notice point wouldn’t count it. Higher It’s far off. average 60 studies roughly .38%.

Which part bus would sit on? Three potential reasons death count could lower 3 months ago: 1) virus mutates, less deadly, 2) younger people getting infected, less likely die, 3) physicians learning improve survival severe cases (i.e., experimental therapies, patients lying prone position, etc.) work university constantly asking reconsider. insane. 

They going kill people decisions. amazing much negative results, countries straight thing digging deeper hole. Alright writing’s wall here, we’re definitely heading another lockdown least states see things spiraling control right now. Look headlines past week now, sans FL (what fuck Florida?) states rolling back giving public tone things serious, previously full steam ahead reopening.

There's gun head. part bus sitting on? COVID definitely going 100% fatal point know much long term effects yet. People know real disease 'whatever' getting like think another cold flu.

It's panicking. reacting sensibly facts presented. Ya, cause mandating masks tough. family helped it. It’s certainly given people. fast food manager, I've following happen thus far pandemic:

Oh well, know fellow introverts thrive New Normal pioneers Great Reform. Finally...the world becoming ours.... digital revolution. must joking. 

One know car accident thing BS way count right?

Even then, think here?

Also, realize first time people reported dying disease without positive test right? assumed it. happening too.

Lastly, 5 murderous governors forced nursing homes take covid positive patients even though space hospitals homes standard PPE etc. accounts thousands needless deaths.

Fuckin leafs. Fuq yuu I’m confused first comment, like poster. asking people saying flattening curve hospital overruns. was.  Count well. confirmed cases county. 

Most anywhere go - much - even money best see masks worn. even one woman come right behind mask inside municipal building.

The exceptions seem hospitals doctors offices. yet seen anyone without mask.

But yeah virtually one rural PA taking seriously IMO one know gotten sick died. Thank advice Rural PA issue. Mexican doctor here. What's going right people getting tests people already hospitalized to, that's positive rate high. 

The cause high rate group getting tests immediate relatives positive cases get test due insurance income. massive testing anywhere country. 

Still situation hospitals chaotic, specially center Mexico border cities US. What’s date it’s suppose magically disappear 53000 deaths per year air pollution caused motor vehicles miles driven per year US deaths per mile driven

Let's say Tesla lasts average 250,000 miles. Tesla saves 0.00411 people death.

Tesla's Fremont factory outputs 34000 vehicles per month. Let's say Tesla lasts 10 years.

34000\*0.00411 = 139.74 lives saved per month.

10,000 people work Tesla factory. 139 could keeling every month Tesla would still ""in green."" Would acceptable people? Obviously not, again, happening. Now, say, ""but that's rough estimate! effect?"" Keep mind, counting:

1. fact Teslas around 4 times safer terms accident rates average dinosaur burner.
2. effects climate change.
3. fact Tesla exponentially growing, means profit car produced invested accelerating transition green energy. So, take 140+ people multiply factor greater one.

Further, factory environment people taking reasonable precautions spread particularly dangerous.

Plus, majority workers Tesla factory likely be:

*FTFY* I've walmart sams club Plank tell none non mask wearers could give shit wear one not. Everyone shit dealing could care less decide wear mask. least thats observation. Personally like walking face covered bc one recognizes dont stand around bullshit lol stay home don’t catch virus? mandatory nationwide. many people die first? Even talking enough put air. guy reason US fucked. **Helpful!**

This source: analysis indicates face covering reduced number infections 78,000 Italy April 6 May 9 66,000 NYC April 17 May 9. addition, varying correlation 15 30 prior onset implementation reveals little difference projection places, high correlation coefficients (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Notably, trends infection curves Italy NYC contrast world United States (Fig. 1C), show little deviation linearity due nonimplementation face-covering measures globally nationally, respectively. 

**So, face masks definitely effective. goes analysis reveals difference without mandated face covering represents determinant shaping trends pandemic worldwide. conclude wearing face masks public corresponds effective means prevent interhuman transmission, inexpensive practice, conjunction extensive testing, quarantine, contact tracking, poses probable fighting opportunity stop COVID-19 pandemic, prior development vaccine. also important emphasize sound science effectively communicated policy makers constitute prime foundation decision-making amid pandemic.&lt;

**At point link #1 state outdoors mitigates airborne transmission. state non mask wearing measures like social distancing US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) emphasized prevention contact transmission, CDC largely ignored importance airborne transmission route (1, 20). current mitigation measures, social distancing, quarantine, isolation implemented United States, insufficient protecting public.&lt;

**So, proved keyword google, made point all. wear mask.** Unfortunately think go unemployment would voluntarily resigning job. However absolutely contact Department Health file report them. Bar restaurant Parton's probably one likely sources virus spreading - especially indoors. We've become decadent society, easily given comforts &amp; convenience. dont want question meat contaminated stop buying it. 
 
No cases! good! Keep buying stuff please! Soon fire sale real estate Florida. mean problem would become, pull up, mask get in. take off. That’s anecdotal. keep care safe. 

Sadly, Florida Texas don’t share sentiment. Yep. 50% well enough time vaccine ready. chosen hard way. parents always us option. Seems collectively never learn. Another observation would baked statisical averaging comparison covid time. deaths, average already counted found significantly less found covid time, suggesting heart attack stroke occurring otherwise. concerning rather something used muddy water. It’s Indiana, maybe people finally realizing move state...

Or playing luck covid get can’t say work work factory Ohio aren’t wearing masks. classified county health department source outbreak. So.... I’m dead pretty much. Wow.

Almost counties green meet governor's requirements.

Oh use mask!!  pretty much. imagine entitled enough demand free everything people working harder ever keep society collapsing pandemic? people money burn, guess. Staycation means staying house. Vacation means vacating house. mean confusing. joke daughter I. Like food expired. appreciate heads use term again.  undercounting trend holds, actual deaths stage would ~155-165k ~175k October 1st ~220k.

Real scary part places like Texas Arizona undercounting much average ~25%, 50%. means double mortality now, also double mortality would expect acceleration over. 2,500 deaths Texas now, 5,000. 10,000 October first, 20,000 (using IHME source).

And pandemic stop October 1st. It'll keep going. Texas alone going tens thousands deaths. that's counting deaths caused regular care comes halt hospitals overflowing COVID patients. Guess figure rest 20% needed herd immunity already infected anti-bodies? vaccine virus, one way likely time frame. Mandate likely gets us 50% states first comment issue US.

They banking lot vaccine phase three currently. think want ready mass distribution end 2020. live tangible material sense.

But seeing sane policy implemented hopeful hope benefit me.

Does you?  Yeah part sucked. honestly NOBODY airport 7 people flight. end day think going to
The supermarket get groceries might’ve given exposure flight. thankfully didn’t contract it. still haven’t. Fingers crossed. Fair enough. worry rich people fleeing Florida they're spiking. I'm CT well I've also seen close 100% mask wearing people using common sense gives hope keep up. would rather touching face nonstop day put on? Like sure, sounds great theory, really think he's gonna sanitizing vigorously in-between? People go bars next county over. Sounds like Arizona adopt adapt New Hampshire's state motto

I'm aged like fine cheese old enough appreciate this. 1 8 American adults alcoholics, enough said staycation means explore city spend money hotel. Vacation means literally vacate house. leaving house overnight vacation! Thins dumbass needs stop pretending part brain. I’m Indiana don’t buy numbers aren’t going up.. tested back beginning June cotton swabs nose. asked nurse bad would hurt, told “we don’t go deep anymore”. swabbed barely inside nostrils (maybe half inch nose) called good. came back negative idk.. maybe they’ve changed resting now. driver every right kick passenger vehicle. Let's Yes like back March said wearing one bad. next week. saying wrong, many chiefs telling us everyone different. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Holy crap. scary. get impression Texas still taking seriously.

Im Newfoundland Labrador, Canada zero active cases new case month now. part strategy provincial Government restricted nonresidents province entering unless applied approved exemption. includes ppl reside provinces. Friday joining called Atlantic bubble residents Atlantic Canada travel provinces without 14 day quarantine (6 active cases 4 provinces). Travel throughout Canada may open weeks. course travel Canada still subject 14 day quarantine.

People flipping ppl provinces visiting. ppl cancelled staycation plans going back lockdown. looking opinions we're really screwed that. Thanks. Look, welcome rules lawyer fucking virus guarantee give shit. pressure 😂 Useless leader majority new cases 20 somethings? Absolutely will. alternative would crippling guilt depression. Humans want sad. Happiness preferable, they'll take anger pinch. Theoretically, cutting severity symptoms reduces length time one spread disease, right, done crisis vaccine protects infection. understand whole conversation suddenly became masks. wearing masks months things flattened. changed? Well, opened lot indoor areas. rocket science. good point! jealous competent government. get haircut mask on. regarding still breathe viruses, regarding might reduce much spread lot? studies whether doctor protect virus working patient, entire population people wearing viruses reduce spread?

Also, take account breathing one virus might nearly bad lot, given idea viral load might play big part severity symptoms?

Seems like arguments I've heard masks inferring want make sure breathe single virus filters everything out, reason people wearing might sick already, problem, also considering whether reduced viral load might beneficial assume exposure worst case Lol, technoptimist moron. second time they've dicked poor (former) employees around videos pandemic. bet you’re getting hit. people furloughed jobs apply to, commuters jobs teleworking full time, bet urgent need buy new car right squash virus impossible do. SF diligent wearing masks closed indoor dining bars.

LA parts SoCal opened things weeks ago. loved going Canada Day celebrations Parliament Hill along 150,000 others. fireworks normally terrific. Hopefully 2021 see return normal times. Meanwhile celebrate have, perhaps reflect need make life better less fortunate neighbors. 

Oh yes, wear version Canada face mask able get one. yeah gilead small. “Sunlight best disinfectant”  friend right stated 'virus real think real' also 'you can't personally name 10 people who've died it'.

I'm beside mindset. would could :/

She's China stuck Thailand. pretty much travel ban every country now. Whats $1 Trillion? 1 phonecall print them. disease new.. No, cours case young person mild covid symptoms 60 suffering multiple organ failure. Yet.

But know many people survive COVID ended severe psychosis delirium issues. hospital visit months release. Since COVID affecting brain changing cell structure (cells growing tenticles) there's cause concern. masses scar tissue result COVID lungs often lungs, also appears attacks organs. Scarred kidneys, scarred liver... whatever attaches attacks scars.

We know regular run mill pneumonia leave scarring 6months. scarring COVID much worse, doctors scientist fear could irreparable. Especially severe cases. 


Most people live damaged organs long seek medical attention. (my family included even though free medical.in canada-both parents died cancer-stage 4 doctors called)

I almost guarantee going see lot ill people also coincidentally contracted COVID. 
It seems lot diseases leave ever-lasting effects us. Polio, Measles, Chickenpox, Smallpox, HIV, TB... repercussions surviving contractions disease. Trump perfectly capable himself! shocked shocked say! 

&amp;#x200B;

I argue reddit literally daily whole idea protesters wearing masks false. Guess got proved right one gives shit honest. live covid fantasy lives new TV. Half people speak think vaccine tracking device. Quebecers pretty stupid point involving public opinion science help anyone. need wait four science done. PhD researcher here. spent hours trying convince person science could find including pretty great meta-analysis published Lancet. response: ""WHO corrupt org funded it."" person heavily believes Essential Oils. science could spout debunked pics YouTube clips. 

We're walls stupidity. provide data, squat hold wall. 27 100 top US pharma companies spend 10 times R&amp;D marketing know seemed states hovering around 30% ICU COVID19.... ppl need elective surgeries too. double edged sword. You’re moron. I’m LA, still couldn’t get appointment testing. Checked multiple sites either full functional. Spent hour filling forms still got nothing. wonder many people given trying. Oh please decrease severity disease.... kinda like flu shot supposed Umm science would say indoor bars big part spread problem right now. Let’s pretend otherwise. thats per unit cost include research overhead take managerial accounting class Well everywhere, still lot douchebags wont wear anywhere, general, ratio lot better. watched local news lately? feel like importance virus lost longer lead story (at least area) don’t get people downvoted you. exact thing done cars, i.e. better training, traffic calming, pedestrian zones, etc, although that’s whole different topic. Maybe people discard think it’s natural thing anyway.
Just clear, though, COVID something _don’t_ want mess around with. wearing masks protest limited many people infected there.

Cloth masks nearly completely ineffective preventing spread virus conditions, especially people spent several hours even days protest events. protesters participate shouting chanting densely packed crowds, generates massive levels airborne particles spread virus. people even wear masks properly frequently remove take drink water.

Simply put, masks limited effect preventing transmission virus conditions. I've busily stockpiling next lockdown. lot replenishing needed done apparently one around concerned. phase 3 read paper confirm talking raw numbers.

When discussing linked journal article, would indeed considered using contextual clues. 

As 0.01 vs 0.02% effect point stating reduction 50% overselling likely broad interval; would need near delta function tell difference distributions. 

If think 5% value worth talking about, that's fine. think 40% reduction worth talking two reasons:
* stratified initial conditions confidence intervals effect sizes convincing group except group 5
* clear trend shows effect worse better initial conditions get worse. think I’m better everyone else :-) Hugos$ Hot food fairly safe. truly problem, guess find soon enough virus floating around tell us. avid bar fly, gotta disagree. ohio, I'm seeing masks social distancing everywhere except churches bars. regulars piled days reopened, fun, seeing everyone get tanked trying get friends stop hugging kinda showed futility bar open. tried one time, thing. back. 

And dammit, miss friends, I'd rather kill grandparents.  make account fake name add friends still use features, without BS. Facebook cesspool, worse comments sections YouTube. barely ever log anymore.  too. I’ll take pneumonia ventilator Eh, there's definitely decent number young people ""BuT RiTEs"" club. still havent received answer masks violate constitution? Muffuckas talking they'd 200 year old document havent even read. easy 'forget said earlier'. primacy effect real, ahit sticks you. Also 90% population doesnt follow news, let alone subscribe message board dedicated minute-by-minute news virus' spread. People cant expected retain much leaders tell (I hear Brad Pitt back market though!), important choose words carefully, Donald. 
 
Fauci excused giving best information time, information changed, someone position attention respect, 'enough time passed now' good excuse. today LabCorp. estimate 2-7 days. Ah, troll. West Midtown checking in. Howell Mill Kroger 50-50. yet, get nothing it

You pay $2500 drug already mentioned two days ago costs $10 produce 

And fucking company got subsidized tax money

And talk elicit sort national pride? I'm going completely straight you. critical thinking skills seem generally pretty uninformed arrogant person. really deserve anything reply. Southern US resident here, working hotel.

The number people tell Covid bullshit, hoax, big deal, etc inform pool area closed due covid disappointing surprising all. I've least 1200ish people last 4 months, maybe 30 form mask. Yeah. Never that. especially americans. conspiracy theory susceptible people earth. terrible liar argue bad faith. hope treat people differently IRL.  happening many places. next logical step stay locked house forever. think really close country throwing hands containing this, anything safe relative efficiency made available going keep spreading see source. Somewhere middle mention important part regarding HIV. people learn True, drug specifically designed diseases, hep c Ebola treatment later discovered, I'm informed enough know else might treat. they're worried vaccine, still sounds like fast money grab, understandable want hit break even point quickly given opportunity. However, vaccine viable, take humanitarian approach provide reasonable pricing break even? Back insulin, EpiPen, etc Check news now. remember States reopened name economy.

Statistics need consider lots things.

Current models indicate protests virtually effect rates, reopenings disastrous. much banana cost? Nothing sort shown genuinely think culture America built around never leaving comfort zone. fact, world American President crazy enough say wanted go back time bunch poor jag-offs thought would swell What? No, it’s even close majority people think like that. idea get news, blatantly false probably result ingesting much sensationalized media. upvotes coming from, goodness I'm less optimistic day. saw fall kicking bit missing it, also figured, ""Hey, we're smart. We'll isolate, get vaccine year, 18-24 months everyone pretty much covered market back track."" 

Turns we're bunch dumb fucks I'm concerned vaccine provide 18 months coverage going rinse repeat good 5 years. We're medical field, although job require first aid training. 

But chick (in Zoom meetings) making fun high risk mom (and family) sending away refused take precautions. sounds like hopes Torygraph point SIP wasn’t squash virus. May ask are?

I see surge, spike headlines early month. TMC still listed Phase 1, non pandemic. 

Y'all enough PPE? Still? Wtfff many died also COVID-19. necessarily it. Best project good Injective Protocol understand Texas Florida reconsidering ""open things"". However think level lockdown could actually cut infection rate 1, reinfection pariah states. worry overwhelming hospital capacity. . review 158 sudden deaths among high school college athletes (from 1985 1995), 115 underwent standard PPE.8 Unfortunately, 4 suspected cardiovascular disease. PPE identified condition responsible death 1 player.8 poor detection rate fatal risk factors suggests PPE adequate intensity today’s football training 3-5 days get results really bad. haven’t improved all. U r dick. US still seems world leader therefore shines bright example across world. Well done US! Well done... have. doesn’t match 1) fact older groups surged cases, 2) timeline cases symptoms appear contraction, 3) fact mass groups ignored social distance Negligent homicide right anyone has. Agreed. traveling overseas years vaccine found. Three weeks ago elective surgeries, don't. freed lot space long ago US condemed China hoarding PPE. Someone pointed perfectly people refuse believe CV real don’t know anyone tested positive. Yet somehow believe billionaire something achieve. military recruiters shilling another pointless war best way escape poverty :D  Well wrong. might better learning, better health. Damnit, go gut

Thanks 😊 USA 300 million doses end 2020. That’s already confirmed. reality is, life back normal minus international travel 3rd world countries next year. Someone please answer question me...

Are closing 4th July weekend? Yep. Anyone support Bernie similar candidates right complain. actually works advantage. family line get well elderly people circle. anti-vaxxers want get it, decision impact care, bye felicia. nothing useful, actively harming efforts politicising measures, tooting horn, aka U.S. Goes show well compared others.
Also thank time summarizing us. Incognito + disable javascript works. ones would go Florida spring break, pack bar, choir practice house, go church, throw graduation party like 1999. fair, pornhub taught lot europeans enjoy butt-hurt. Yeah they're lower. 25% Corona deaths tested virus. governor acts like Mr. President Sir Trump. hand gestures, postures everything. 

Great minds think alike great people act alike.

Meh. Texas update:

[Alex Berenson - Texas Haha thankyou, needed laugh. fans idiots? Great. US object lesson do.

 wanted greatest, are, worst way possible. .. no. sure people hanging homes aren’t wearing mask around friends family. know happening NY. cases rise come August LOL anytime Let’s forget queen, Kacey Musgraves. She’s modern Dolly They're reddit. Marathon masturbation sessions? Source? complicit Mike Pence standing right next him.  Political futures assholes cooked. Global pandemic. Huge gathering. Groom sick COVID symptoms.
 
Just take Tylenol get party.
 
Un-fucking-believeable. honestly difficult gather much sympathy one. tremendous, powerful data! much program test 40 million unemployed workers exact income level cost? highest week, lowest week, average week, arbitrary combination weeks pay? independent contractors lie get infinite money? people making enough live anyways get evicted pandemic? 

It's flat $600 crisis time extra money answer questions. idea get money fast possible. $600 much places, enough others, Americans adequate live this. Actually, supported people protesting lockdowns well. also believed protest could also serve spread virus. bar pizza roast beef Corruption United States lower third second world, compared developed countries bottom half, good considering countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal etc. considered developed countries.

Your social security laughably bad compared western Europe.

Your crime rates laughably bad compared Western Europe. Would say hospitals almost full? it! begining end!! pointed /u/notoneoftheseven pointed link.

It one factory use bought one months production.

With 5 factory's making saying Europe getting screwed little top say? Almost like looking reason butt hurt. Funny, thinking I'd like stand behind Paris Kaye. People showing entitled assholes. Lol...oh yea hiding 100 thousands deaths cases...my god think earth flat too..better question actually wants florida texas murder citizens like ny NJ did. USA COVID cases right now. killing infecting people ever July. They'll start reporting July 2020. 
Not February. 

JULY.

What fucking shameful waste time energy. Wast time. likely get infected surface transmission. one unlikely ways get it. wash hands clean stuff recommendations first easiest make. data seems play little role. secretly heart want win another term. white house become gilded cage dream job nightmare. he's gonna go way lived, were. We're ride. appears ignoring evidence instead going opinion prices. You’re crazy like buying mops hardware store pipe leaking. Using word government make political comment nazi moderator Florida positive cases deaths going 

Trending toward herd immunity? Coordinated needed start. Instead, see 'let states handle it' attitude repeated like mantra. get that's American value whatever, state going handle crisis global scale? governors way depths even pandemic thing. Still hit paywall. I'd rather avoid paywalled sites circumvent them. Seems like maybe can't handle positive news? New hospitalizations 1265 per week (as June 30). 762 per week June 7th rising pretty steadily since. Florida show number currently hospitalized though. bodies G? agree look way one maybe thin “Mensa” members. Really? must live nice area then. Wish people town would wear one. Saving lives DEATH PANELS!!! 

Also, Bill 5Gates wants inject chip vaccine mind control . . . . . . ummm . . . buying Office 365 subscription? Everyone isn’t dying depression drugs violence crime. evidence that? greatest amount people dying COVID, hands down. 

If asking point understand flattening curve useful. rate infected die important. number people end hospital time problem. 

Sweden admitted took wrong approach, changed it. entirely unable protect at-risk population. obese elderly died, cares, right? 

I’m glad part. understand bad things happen lockdown. People going die poverty created lockdown. time. Again: that’s point. 

And definitely say lockdowns happened much early places uncertainty. honestly strict mask social distance requirements right start lockdowns could delayed even longer. hindsight 20/20. Young people aren’t risk that’s Universal reopen, youngsters flock too. Can’t see anything going wrong opening one largest amusement parks country time like  going ignore scientific evidence goes narrative evidence pointing towards reopening country true reason behind surge , posting stats (which correspond states reopening) evidence shows disprove own. provided one study scientist showing blm protest caused rise cases. proceed strawman certain articals ignore point whole. Clouds man everyone getting them, said pending next (I got one weeks worth months ago) general, seems like perfect excuse push isolationist policies. surprised countries never reopened. Life price tag. Life insurance example exists countries too.... “If states option wait”

“Civil War”

You legitimately don’t get concept innocent black people dying hands police poor coronavirus response. protests necessary telling black people “it’s time wait” tone deaf best definitely touch Söder saved day. think taken actions Austria, time Austria could numbers like Norway.

It quite tough time seeing Austrian troops border people going almost normal.

Nevertheless thankful government. Merz Merkel fear would fared like Americans.  strongly encourage people expect politicians.

Newsom dropped ball, never got cases zero, reopened prematurely without plan routinely screen hospital staff asymptomatic cases. sad news :( RIP groom, get well soon infected. Japan old country population-wise. old people wear masks Chad Karen. Worst thing I'm getting married next month I'm expecting kind attendance. One word laws get offended. Hell even parents get offended. Terrible. Please say, “I don’t” weddings right now. Bo Burnham:  Try this, still problem, disable javascript browser.  Except Philly, testing anyone symptomatic cases, young protestors tested found great increase infection rate. course that's one city.  Ohio, service industry also. former co-workers getting federal $600+state ui. saved family. wife independent contractor gotten anything. yeah, bit make, covering 2 incomes, 5 total people. Things tight, rent utilities paid date. 

When over, family staring living car. Masks mandatory live us tho? Give tax credit. Put way, burden, dead people ones alive draining medical system, cannot work, cannot pay rent, infecting others also cannot same.  Wow. Countries racist? Pretty sure that's individuals. economy taken huge hit death rate higher surrounding neighbors. massive investigation getting underway leadership currently mishandling pandemic.

Regardless death rate, disease leaving behind really nasty effects doctors sure symptoms permanent.

I get people keep playing this? confirmation bias astounding me. Life know hold mate might long time. Edging us closer Medicare All.  literally made mention single plot point Oh, surprised. 

BTW, thought talking graph linked, FHM's? current growth rate, double weeks. ""could"", ""will"". 

This avoided, US starts sensible things prevent transmission.

A nation-wide mask order, lots communication, would example sensible thing do. It’s proven fact didn’t. also you’re racists. GOOD DAY SIR :D it’s wrong team owners essentially people’s bodies way. players get make decisions right please, make plan already? im tired data ifs flooding every information outlet. Looks like under, 100 pretty normal Cali. It’s small sample size. course it’s Phase 1. Whew lad. Tbh even guesstimate time frame incredibly comforting. Remember possible reasons contributing factors lack uptick:

Wearing mask prevent identified. Wearing mask reduce effects tear gas. Wearing mask prevent disease transmission. previously socially isolated strictly. Wearing mask previous non-protest circumstances. higher correlation non-GOP parties willingness follow CDC guidelines. Prevalence exposures outside instead enclosures buildings.

You limit exposure people, people represent risk. Thousands baseball careers ended. Sad. adds credibility, know counterintuitive. way back late Jan think obviously want people associate HIV virus panic. Many sources confirm HIV insertions acts similar HIV. regards measles statement, sources show scientists specifically gain function research bat coronaviruses, specifically burns human cells Ace2 receptor. also another source conform broke thing except HIV insertions. honestly surprised lack informed people sub, offense. Also wuhan_ flu sub better. 3) contact tracers told ask. possible, cell tests much complicated antibody tests due actually recognize virus. Antibodies bind directly virus test able bind samples patients plasma part virus itself.

The difference cells recognize portion virus ""presented"" cells body molecule highly variable throughout population. cells molecule (MHC) highly different different people different populations different people recognize different chunks virus easy one size fits test cell activity. Also lot cells blood one time specific certain virus catching lot harder.

So end day yes laboratory setting tested, done large scale like antibody tests much harder stop rich. Apparently people worldview certain parking illegal, costs $200.  NARDDOG! remember people using countries like ""if contact tracing could South Korea"" ""at rate Italy three weeks"" ""let's China take extreme measures"". I'm trying figure kind situations could shortened ""doing U.S"" I'm favor harm reduction. I'm advocating vaccine.

I'm advocating informed consent people understand risks act accordingly. New normal who? I’m getting asked back work. posted thousand times already talk reality 2 weeks less guess shave it, huh? It’s weird seeing this. live Maryland masks mandatory quite time. people seem comply. assumed like everywhere. assume dying ""others"" polls suggest majority Americans (even 80%) care concerned virus. Unfortunately government represents minority Americans, also happen loud stupid. proven fact BLM protests cause viruses spread?

Let's assemble whole world BLM protest then. eradicate COVID, right, genius? haven’t figured bars nightclubs safely,” 

Because possible  fair, may fools we're assuming people read articles family? call one them. cousin havnt talked ages, even nothing common. 

Dont feel bad this. loads lonely people right now. personally know someone massive extrovert. Like whole world friends. one talked things going quarentines manage. Hes alone 100 days. think lost mind though, taught knit, currently learning new language....klingon. Yes please, learn pride ignorance.

We shining example could become celebrate ignorance like Americans do. 

Murica! Could. could not. Meaningless words. Let's hope work like Mexican food. necessarily like “Mexicans.” sure heck don’t like “Mexicans” telling do. Another problem get talked much may equipment pull storage, much extra trained staff work it. Instead treated fully trained staff get mix experienced ICU staff help. worse gets thinner experienced staff gets spread. gets less optimal treatment. NYC, contact tracers told ask positive cases attended protest. Fauci also reported people cooperating contact tracers. words, way claim protests impact. simply measuring it; mean impact protests exist. ain't talking flu. It’s phase 1 trial. enough money keep em alive. going to, seriously, double again?

Considering many it, even hospitalized, came talking nonsense? Vast majority double even even family members die it. bad headline. Fauci always said confident vaccine. never said certainty. makes sound like 180 click bait article lol.

Force factor😭 ... people drink judgement diminished . 
Bars hooked loan pools subsidized feds based income set part future earnings. 
There ways things protect business owners keeps patrons safe... it’s us create political environment compel sensible actions. It’s phase 1 trial. course it’s small sample size. Good!

(On personal note: someone sponsor take refuge there, lol? state somehow proactive indifference letting us sicken die.) know safe is, Amtrak actually sticking selling 50 percent seats. add that, seat spacing practically double airlines offer, especially long distance train would riding. So...at least that. think we've gotten little better making vaccines since 1960s? pain virtue signaling. Got it. selfish bro. Good call Good news! supreme court legalized public education money go private religious schools. Religion course well known teach critical thinking skills needed day age. Fill Bryant-Denny times dead people maybe even Alabama start figure Trump like Cersei season 8 Game Thrones. wants people suffer die Biden takes Biden one “rule” over. Trump literally sees ruler public servant. Imagine fucking morons break social distancing rules riots protests. It’s proven fact racist. things true. Good day sir:) solid proof came animals. would likely get car accident going destination catching covid. brings question, means would be? virus gets control people refusing go out, donors going exactly? They're going able force people homes propaganda work long. people going pro-quarantine massive failure reopening was.

I currently forced stay home positive person theres literally nothing whole month now. situation many people find continue headbutt virus stupidity science. keep telling people this! Also asymptomatic people/those aren’t getting tested, gotta believe numbers MUCH higher ): Wow. Massachusetts HDI 0.956, comparable Norway.

TBh also expected Deep South states lower HDI indicated Goodness. Thanks sharing story. antibody test current case ( person used sick longer is) non- case. data wrongly used present misleading data public. Ask NBC science reporter, Dr. Joseph Fair, spent several days hospitalized covid. convinced one crowded, careless flight caused transmission. exhausting hearing ""i never thought could happen me. could happen me, could happen anyone"" over. 

YES, CORRECT. HAPPEN ANYONE. PLEASE PUT GODDAMN FUCKING MASKS PLEASE. You’re lucky one. Almost everyone else asked back work person within month state. Agreed. It’s huge reason US still screwed. Ah yes makes racist say protests causing pathogens spread lie.

In words deluding makes racist. ""safety issue."" head CDC beard btw. air airplanes constantly changed run HEPA filters. cabins undergo complete air change roughly every 6 minutes.

In terms enclosed space hours, closer hospital *much* safer restaurant grocery store. She’s funded big state corporate donors.

Which allowed opinion People forgot dismissed NYC went through.

Why?

Because accepted denied COVID19 hoax, Dear Leader said so.

And, deaths reported. Visibly soiled, lol. Like could see virus. Oh sorry thought talking laws let open container certain areas, like NOLA. Yeah, ones cops fuck drinking public blow. gotta discreet group needs chill, good, one fucking adults drinking responsibly public (unless look homeless, member marginalized group, case bets bc cops worst) don’t think they’re laughing. think horrified didn’t expect see us implode fast fantastically. 

It’s frustrating, though, much mask resistance.  Yes, sadly. One person know believes vaccines “full toxins cause autism brain damage” undergraduate degree Cornell. BAFFLING. I’m available motivational speeches covid-19 Yeah, believing friends protestors going tell testing sites BLM protest totally believable. totally see giving government information. 

I tik tock sis. I'm actually protester group friends. Ppl begged go ones previous years went one. Said really cool. Ppl smoking drinking lol. Glad liked them.

It virtue signaling lockdown boredom. ppl really cared name ton black ppl murdered cops went protest barely anyone showed up. changed? video? show tons dating back years. changed ppl sick lockdown angry straw broke camel's back. Oh shit flat earth common sense flat earth subreddit. sort ""logic"" work. I'm saying wrong, provide actual sources subreddit.   strategy containment, can't half-ass it. take action either early, drastically reset clock.

In places like Wyoming even Ohio, probably could ramped testing, canceled large events, told people WFH possible, closed bars/clubs, especially put mask mandates place early on. Likely places never really close priorities right. We've seen resurgences areas opened bars low mask adherence, meaning masks + closing bars/large events enough keep things spiraling control, least summer.

In places like NYC, harder lockdown, quicker get back ""manageable"" levels. go back masks + large gatherings bars off-limits.

tl;dr Lockdowns tool get cases manageable level only. Restrictions could minimal prioritized testing/contact tracing wearing masks. I’m American worry result sparsely populated America. anyone else similar morbid thoughts? feel bad even thinking worried America world also suffer. deaths still declining though... Increased testing finds cases. Everyone’s suppose get anyways, point lockdown, get slowly hospitals weren’t overrun. article little date (published April). think there's really shortage surgical masks anymore. Yo smack shit friend sake future everyone died infectious disease seek justice well? What's difference? lives less valuable die Covid? It’s okay though you’re racist. good day sir. :) tried, say lot governors. Also, easy every state East give fck. vitamin regimen prior? Nba players proving true. Well, get 100k day oughta hit herd immunity 6 years! Yes everyone knows late June peak flu season absolutely true. 6/24: Zeke feels normal- reports saying tested positive started around 6/15. article citing mom makes sound like got days 6/15: though, find links proving disproving anything days. also possible protestors tended self-isolate afterwards, result contributed less spread protested instead conducted normally. Given almost total ubiquity masks protests, plausible I'd guess likely went home thinking, ""There's good chance now, extra careful weeks.""

If people want reduce discussion to, ""If put huge number people area, number infections occur greater zero"" ball, that's winning argument find real person made straw actually disagrees. Interesting Covid influenza, that's brutal. I'm glad he's recovering. Airplanes windows too, else pilots might hard time. :)

Train windows opened looks like Amtrak personnel US whole virus thing kinda scary realize it’s based study couldn’t replicated contagion idea stems bacteria used explain virus causes disease. testing identifying virus shown difficult innacurate. Well would agree guy set didn’t. wasn’t looking sympathy go fund me🤷🏻‍♀️. Someone could’ve set fun didn’t realize would take like did. Like miracle Large northeastern cities massive protests spikes. Here’s NYC’s graph daily new cases, example. I’m actually surprised protests don’t seem causing upticks (I support them, don’t get wrong, worried going public health disaster), that’s it’s looking like. sure wrong people always asking unlimited freedom rights , say Government shall something this.

I think might registration requisition holding big concert?   
 Government shall reject propose application pandemic still on-going.

If even unavoidable , many people accumulate, government shall guidance send someone monitor event anti-virus basis. said interesting thing deleted autobot moderator comment showed fundamental nature Coronavirus Crisis USandA totally politically created. state closed opened April laugh pain away hahaha. It’s short lived. Take us Pittsburgh example. sounds little good true believe important Sunday service church,

as well determined make economy recover actively participating it.

Fox news telling months masks much add complacency. mean people find pregnancies They’re rude awakening realize there’s whole lot right masks required every public space staff citizens shame submission one on. lowering testing FL. Count us out. Thanks. would amazing coronaviruses would include common cold I’m mistaken, sounds like possible would another miracle. I’m crossing fingers getting excited. live CO, part decent balance protecting vulnerable letting people live lives. Western Mass best Mass. Jus sayin. need light shade threw. Az get 240 week taxes that's eligible full benefits. 

That extra 600 week allowed people pay bills buy necessities plus spend things wanted needed. Spending helps economy, least that's I've read lol tried slowing testing, perhaps help. He’s probably got kid named “A.C.” seem clever front lackeys. USA fucked

Just like UK still exists despise losing glory, predict mark important step USAs fall.... death. limp along, like washed been.

That's USA is.

A washed been.

Sure, y'all best military.... what? China others constantly catching tech, economy, eventually military.

Y'all fucked. Another company bid good riddance. Sure, get first paycheck...then buy bicycle...then save moped...then save car. travel time gets shorter shorter, longer keep working improving options.

The problem impossible. problem want something easier...and want immediately.

That life works. hard work *first*, get reward. Wouldn’t 100,000,000 infected little 3 months? Aka third US population. Assuming mortality rate 1% would 1 million dead alone ~4months time. Also assuming doesn’t continue grow exponentially.

Im numbers man; seems pretty bad. someone installed carpet college, miss profession.  Clearly know I'm talking making observation. would impossible find anyone else coming conclusion me. probably generous since could try break statistical likehood many jobs particular skill given population likehood match specific roles. I'm sure live somewhere abundance jobs mechanical engineers, fine dandy unless twice many work mechanical engineers jobs. Let's consider people even get door find companies systems called applicant tracking systems specifically block applicant specific keywords phrases resume. Meaning mechanical engineer automatically blocked consideration electrical engineer jobs on. 

Leaving us stocking store shelves like know target paying $50/HR please let everyone know. 

Any help still ""not familiar""? 130K lot death. [Relatively speaking, USA seen lower death rates Europe including Switzerland, UK, France, Belgium's death rate 16% compared 5% USA. difference population makes things much less obvious compare. One conditions concealed carry permit can’t firearm you’re wearing mask public.

When local state governments mandate wearing mask public effect denying Second Amendment Right bear arms.

Mask laws Unconstitutional violate citizens Inalienable Rights.

People wild. Industru people everywhere pushed breaking point, large portion starting get sick back work. Honestly second lockdown sounding super appealing. can't believe people still debating wearing masks Ah. see got confused. Easy do. mom piece shit care children. Hope clears things up. idiots decided attend wedding middle pandemic? lowest possible tier acceptable good day. I’m Christian support science. aren’t ignorant. can't find link (sorry, getting tired ready bed) - royalty agreement also available developed countries manufactures make well. completely free like underdeveloped nations. Trump got elected :) think talk majority right. way die cast. think people are...doing start pandemic. us getting supplies stocked February taking inventory coming US, us barely watching China total denial things would severe here.

I feel are, watching months like sea drawn back ocean.

Everything said accurate quickly. new normal prediction, going something takes generation get through. solved problems virus hit us. They're still here, them. problems already created fragile state affairs us, ranging environment, social/class inequality, partisan politics dividing nation us vs them, military industrial complex, big pharma healthcare crisis, opiod epidemic, drugs, prison population, mental health support veterans, systemic racism, violence, rising cost rent, education, student loan debt, debt general lack savings general population, disparity wealth upper middle class, poor education system underfunded schools underpaid teachers, corrupt politicians, media heavily dominated funded political/financial agenda driven reporting, poor diets...

I could go on, top head short list things America needs work great difficulty dealing even best times booming economy.

We cannot keep kicking road. Someone going pay piper unsustainable way life.

One upswing virus acted agent bring light many already glaring problems population distracted look them. generation forced look things greater chance finding takes something them. greater chance leaders emerge, born face kinds challenges.

A uncomfortable amount time going required get side whatever looks like.

 I've saying months now, no...I think understand collectively happening here. Electing certain president going fix us, war go fix us. Hard times, great sacrifices made time upheaval, unrest, unwellness finally break last remaining straw camel's back. ready times interesting, dangerous uncertain times.

The advantage see far out. hear train coming directions bridge one track it. best information, land ears many late. learn lessons kinetic impact terminal velocity experiencing naked collision site.

I wish could one days. lala land fingers ears hands eyes, upset president masks facebook ads whatever. Sounds like paradise I'm foreseeing.

Fact check here, vaccine. Spanish Flu ran course 3 years. missed window contain give us best chance 2nd wave comes. numbers we're seeing worst case scenario numbers. Unemployment, infections per day, add protests last month...

I get chest. Even though see coming still burden. way while. Americans starting realise why. mom. Go room Ryan. Nobody ever isolates much tell media do. LOL, thanks outing troll. Bye, troll. interesting see attendance compares average. Hopefully people choose attend. Sending good vibes! Nice try, Governor DeSantis. know you. hobbies, generally gravitate towards golf, rock climbing, flying small airplane (TBM 700). necessarily better professional wrestling (lol), happen highly enjoyable. people seems take personal offence depiction chinese people human beings faults virtues everyone. fit exceptionalist narrative freedom loving americans sheepish chinese people fed propaganda. Figure irony. 

At end, guess, saltiness management crisis sounding differences outcome different countries . language call attitude ""to blame cobblestone"", someone looks reasons failures everywhere except mistakes . keep posting videos? anyone wants see them, go YouTube.

Oh, i'll re-iterate - guy medical doctor, even though Dr prefixed name. retired nurse Phd teaching. started knitting past weekend, 100% everyone knit crochet it’s soooo calming it’s super helpful mental health past days actually something fun productive rather sit read depressing/enraging articles day Donors actually way down, least while, seen stats recently. Healthy people dying car accidents such, since really supposed anything going anywhere. I’m sorry. sucks. Okayy, sorry, heard different things friend Ashdod.  sure crosses mind too. family wouldn’t even get new job work remotely. might pull trigger depending next election goes. 🤦‍♂️ Blood tests checks coronavirus sometime past. won\`t tell now. family take Covid19 seriously along, means accept mother's death least partially fault. wonder he's denial it. wonder caught case 2. right thing isolating 14 days going hot spot sought medical attention immediately started symptoms. Great job, Massachusetts! mean common sense, something continue spread convenient access manuever about.

Even one outside closed spaces, make things worse lot protests carried out.

Better planning would great. Aswell many things. Looking things happening though, like planners said ""protests"" purposely place line fire.

Anyways... covid causes respiratory depression etc... going strangely ironic people chanting ""I can't breathe"" non choreographed display asphyxiation. Multiple failures identify fallacies fallacy *Mayor blames people people things opening way fucking soon. * I'm actually thrilled done commenting - I'm getting tired. Long day. EU actually punishments wearing masks, actual lockdowns looked like ghost towns. done thing. see post everyday OP saying won’t wear mask allow government control them. saying stuff like, “ body choice”

I’ve stopped responding, I’ll let learn hard way. can’t argue sort logic. pandemic shown us absolutely stupid people are. 

“How could see coming”

“Only happened another country first”

“Only happened another state first”

“Only happened someone knew first”

And time people deny covid dangerous catch it, late. start take seriously misinformation spread, saying way worse thought. 

Then idiots still haven’t got fortunate enough mild symptoms say paid big pharma crap. 

People literally won’t care till nearly kills family. 

The world could actual fire people wouldn’t care got burned cinders insane. I’d believe it. Good afternoon CCP. Hope weather nice are. covid May. Mild symptoms couple days chest pain, fewer, muscle pain. symptoms came went two moths ish. feeling symptom free period, week ago started feel mild chest pressure (only right side, headache stomach problems. stomach problems related antibiotics took since got ear infection right past first wawe symptoms. breathing issues able go walks generally active. scary feel something know why. I'm feeling little bit better again, chest pressure headache reduced lot yesterday felt anything yet today. I'll hope come back I'm finally free shitty virus. People needs take seriously.. Luckily live country takes seriously closed early control 8k confined cases. still massive testing contact tracing. works now, I'm worried second waiwe fall. Especially since people think response govt worked everyone acting like virus. Correct. Spain, double Floridas population, maxed around 9000 2 - 3 weeks super strict lockdown.

Clinical presentation showing typical symptoms. Taken One agreed criteria includes “reciprocity,” meaning EU won’t allow incoming travelers countries barred European citizens entering. Another condition deciding bar rate new Covid-19 cases, according another internal document seen Bloomberg

I assume Vietnam’s, Taiwan's, possibly countries’ cases (since draft list lot 15, still US, though), simply weren’t comfortable enough let EU travellers enter yet. Even China allowed list Beijing agree that, relationship EU China much important. Logical fallacy Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* follow episode said saying stuff get Bill Burr worked think it’s funny getting Bill Burr mad Trying like cool kid school even though life mess. Ok, familiar Trump operates. We'll leave there, appears want argue people. grateful pack 24 rolls lol

I'm still understanding actually necessary (or others) buy toilet paper. Ebola less contagious COVID-19.

If look initial responses recent outbreaks Wuhan Beijing, went really hard compared.

Maybe educate yourself. ""*AND 2) people want it.*"" people really wanting whose businesses failing lack customers lack desire supplies manufacture. Owners desperate get businesses going **along with** people general buy-and-consume mentality. Remember, business supplied **essential** needs still operating usually increased sales profits (grocery stores good example). Hospitals usually run like 60-70% capacity I'm told. Paying excess beds (and significantly, people staff beds) cuts profits Yeah, receiving $600, automatically added unemployment benefits state here. big help making loss income unemployment. $600 benefit ends end July. 

My boyfriend actually qualify regular unemployment current job long enough like two weeks. wait May PUA system get set up, eventually went through. sure state in, Ohio I've gotten pretty good navigating system. lived New York City nitwit. America would require marathon reach next town next city. 

Also you’ve read book would know movie made story seem like miracle really was. Remove ""country music"" get true form. retarded statement. know? traveled Africa recently? ""third worlders"" count right? need AC problem problem.

My problem everyone's problem. mean, MAYBE that's true, but.. so? Twitter FOX give Trump money. death counts 4 weeks removed memorial day country started give spike. people infected Memorial day likely still living. 5ish week delay exposure resulting death. 10 days first symptom average hospital stay 23 days death.

I'd predict death rates going start catch July August. IKR. Even assumed could would need shower time got there. You’d look unprofessional hell. You’d probably fall asleep job.  Makes total sense me. wearing mask anyone else know, I've sewing family friends. log Reddit every fucking post top comment ""jUsT wEaR FuCkInG mAsK"" genuinely makes hate stop giving shit it. Yes still wear one grocery store, idiots, makes support people protesting totally get coming from. acting like pod person valid value. understand never ""get"" American politics encourage scream void. American thing, shoehorn poor people unbalanced diets claim overweight negates humanity. People really swallow propaganda right states. moral failures individual collectively structural failure institutions systems.

America needs revolutionary structural change, dont see coming time soon. don’t understand basic math time works. human body works, matter. 

You likely white male given everything. minimum given resources life allow condescending attitude towards people aren’t you. 500k deaths whilst majority countries strict lockdowns promoting social distancing measures. imagine numbers none place? Fucking twitter influence POTUS. Random people FOX news influence POTUS. able influence POTUS magical qualification means someone's opinion matters. Hey buddy, streets police officers would get killed went down, bodies lay days rotting streets.

Hahaha people full shit, can't help laugh fact us can’t tell whether joke says lot average American. Keep mind detecting every case is. suggests number newly infected 100k 200k per day time now. heroes! /s  Deaths lag considerably, point pandemic paying attention would know  Jesus Christ please stop ignoring protests aren’t contributing factor seeing happening nationwide?

Do cite back assertion feelings? Three months far. still coordinated federal response, there?  countries lock why? Amazing Oh see, means refusal replenish masks conveniently irrelevant today. Got Heath worker literally walking door door test people hotspots (53000) week.

Im disappointed see folks pile Victoria. could happened anywhere Australia deserve support. Especially since people think response govt worked everyone acting like virus.

This way fucking relatable.  problem many states mandate masks, little enforcement. I'm 100% sure manipulated. already got Florida whistleblower explaining cooking books COVID statistics. reason believe Texas same. Like send elderly folks Corona back highest risk populations. Yeah right case study ass. glad left 30 years ago. NY become shithole. Doctors dont rule government tho whole mask discussion reminded time national service. cold war peak. ABC warfare part game. Corona would belong 'B'. get idea could protect us gas mask available, could try different items. Cloth one them. Yes, filter helps second, maybe long enough reach gas mask delay exposure Corona provide protection always promise.

It hard believe materials improved much mask worth effort even manufacture it. way, scientists medical community different views, pick radical one first (which happened Wuhan, even radical policy work, human race doomed)

Beijing chosen time aggressive high-risk areas, moderately blocked medium-risk areas lightly blocked low-risk areas

It's based experience, bit bit.

I hope understand science, medicine public health policy. Well, cheers up, us ignoring US government right things. Id rather alive, least parents grandparents. Im pretty sure kids would trade 'normal' that. seems like issue selfish short sighted adults anything else. Strap July. call Herd Festival.  course type information something kept secret citizens. Deaths May: ~42K

Deaths June: Same. don’t know many though. so, know better talk way around us. Thank contributing greater goods. here. Even state reopens mean cases went down. Everyone responsible track locality's statistics act accordingly. idiots think reopening means cases went down. Nope.  needs *""The people's elbow!!""* Every comment sounds like “I hate American I’ll rank America”. I’d still rather live America rather anywhere else. you’ve got chance become something different, chance better now. Try countries. go places Ohio wearing N95s makes look like kind deformed duck, hardly anyone wearing mask wearing chinstrap. 

Constantly get weird looks, fuck 'em.

 Enjoy virus, I'm gonna protect since nobody else is. guys still debating abortion universal health care. It’s fucking insane. Imagine pointing fingers others hiding numbers country exact thing Damn, could use plot armor. “We’ve also made Medicare free every Canadian citizen, avoid becoming like U.S say little paid job?

It's pathetic Rep....... look information go, ""Well, deserve much money, deserve slaves little pay!""  riots. sending positive vibes Yes, crazy stupid. resident living Cape Cod: visitors state in-state 100% wearing masks- beach yesterday, maybe 30% wore masks. bike trail, maybe 20-30%. We're screwed. US has, one day, almost triple total number cases Japan had, despite cases detected first Japan. make well minimum wage state weekly unemployment (without $600) $35 week. We're incredibly lucky husband forced continue working whole time paycheck 2 us unemployed 2 kids home, survive without it. completely unscientific opinion country’s success throttling coronavirus attributed mask wearing maybe exclusively effectiveness masks’ contain aerosols. think number behaviors change too.

Mandatory masks would mean people touch mouths nose less often public, also, probably low key keeps people home wearing mask extended period isn’t exactly enjoyable. Near window open opened. I'm sorry deal that. try pleasant polite retail workers, hopefully people like help balance things out. Isn’t “Arnold” proper noun? point folks south flee north?

Countless new Yorkers fled city, younger folks went parents, wealthy folks went vacation homes. martial response.

I'm expecting large migration. ready? sucks expensive price saving lives. rest world wants develop cheaper alternative that's great news! mum always said people need consequences people need swift kick horse.

People think different don’t know. can't answer that. believe manufacturing process terribly complicated though since already least five manufacturers across globe making it. company announced 15,000 job cuts. got first mortgage, lmao. shit sucks. much. Good ol reddit lol. continues amaze people see displays clear outspoken cruelty evil find way rationalize ignorance stupidity. face evil people , looks confirm, dumb Type 1 diabetic big thing learned health issues this

They give fuck: kill you.

Some politicans acting like political issue swayed using ""right words"" virus fucking put ground. sub, voted kind like sign probably right. fucking dumb thing say. Either people know happen super smart. average person dumb all, likely smart person smarter like way put quotes, without actual quote. precautions remove odds... USA pathetic dumpster fire nation. Verging failed state. Source: live former failed state see unfolds.  vaccine, way this. Yeah, actually impossible tell Trump peak absurd. amount people know (that know other) say lockdowns get trump office - shocking. people think that's reason careful, going work I'm heading bed (long day, I've since yesterday morning) - I'll save link tomorrow afternoon. course handful officials believe this, also entire community large. fact, China's policy rationale guidelines ordinary people's behavior come leading virologists (Zhong Nanshan, Li Lanjuan, Zhang Wenhong). etc.), policy rationale guidelines action ordinary people come.
I've said many times, I'll say again, 100% faith science medicine, following methods science medical scientists way control coronaviruses American, deserve this. dropped ball. surprising, movement going *50k rise one week June

And 2.4% death rate scary higher worldwide average. Florida doesn’t pay unemployment systems disaster worst country. Desantis ass. OP's opinion: 

I like stunt much, think poses major danger.

The virus containment methods Czech republic moved national rules local methods. today, republic, masks mandatory anymore.

[On regularly updated map, regional outbreaks traced. regions outbreaks stricter rules enforced. 

Now work? people risk areas sufficiently follow rules? We'll see. state high numbers, largest concentration old people, deaths? makes sense unless coroners choosing pre-existing conditions cause death Covid-19. diagnosed Covid months ago. ""covid toes"" which, purpling feet went away, materialized hands weeks later (after thought better). constant pins &amp; needles hands feet. never goes away. recently blood work done find anything else wrong (like diabetes) doctor decided also run antibody test... came negative (all numbers fine diabetes anything obvious). proven reduce time hospitals, actually save lives, no? WTF‽100 USD‽ That's nuts! located? [The O'Jays - Love past week, i've hearing lot people Houston say they've hard time getting testing slot many people trying get tested. Seen several people local forums say gave up. husband already agreed get sick exposed we're gonna proceed go hospital get sick enough. One crash pandemic make!

Snowballing crashes highway, however... That’s sad. least governor knows he’s doing. segregation?


Also corruption ain't bad cuz far remember U.S. somewhere top 20 least corrupted countries I'm aware totally legal lobbying might reason stil... fair judgement cuz I'm 1st world country much corruption.

Also crime US going least going riots terrorism obviously goes probably temporary.


Just look crime rate 70-80s now.


Also mean social security?

Another important thing mention textbook example work guess what... western European countries (duck UK brexited) copied USA lots central eastern European countries too.

The best governments happen NA EU so... works! perfect obviously probably political parties removed instead voting party would vote plans, ideas leaders. backlog issue. People need checks eat. 

I think things going get much worse extra $600 week goes away. every country manufacturing facilities could switch? countries generic manufacturers allow export near term? Tests show subset infected. R0 2-2.5 relevant interventions. Distancing, banning large gatherings many things reduce reproduction number much smaller portion population immune. fragile ""normal"" herd immunity sustainable test trace isolate, also necessity failed. Could one person detect with, say, cheap pulse oxymeter? answer yes, may well buy one. UK list treated EU country. China list provided reciprocate 2090 people cases occurred span 3 weeks, company covered results early avoid shutting down. already accounted previous days. company forced government pay medical fees people community affected virus directly, including free testing everybody. 

Please stop spreading misinformation think surge worse NYC's, deciding factor healthcare workers. basically everyone around country come help northeast, happens 14 NYC outbreaks across country? r/agedlikemilk Absence evidence evidence absence. downtown Detroit weekend. Zero surprise. literally shocked lack social distancing, literally thousands people, saw MAYBE dozen wearing masks. road Abilene. fuck Millennial here. country gone insane. youngest oldest accept information suits worldview “freedoms”. 

Everything thought would happen since pandemic started reopening, happening. thing didn’t predict Feds ability print infinite money give rich make economy seems like it’s amazing, time least. 

I keep looking headlines see people become bored Covid stopped caring, unfortunately viruses don’t work like news social media...this thing persist take precautions possible. riots stopped people bothering, it’s back media bored riots. Pandemic 3.0 elections. 

If lockdown occurs leads holidays, going see interesting economic collapse retail...or not... infinite money. 

But economy risk reward....something give. think people think virus works way too. 

You can’t ignore it. Lifetime symptoms, possible deaths, complete isolation get it! Imagine things can’t get without risking killing little old lady store! I’ve chalked predatory misinformation fed people.

Like see mistrusting authority, comes injecting something don’t know works see rightly sceptical, it’s misinformation people getting try understand they’re agreeing sets movements like this. Anything negative China sub get tons votes ban. Nah different one Shit leaked around world anyone even heard it. Maybe people live bit responsible even pissed. much case America Hockey big thing here, red wings means something completely different Lol.
Bullshit. No. doesn’t know who/what strangers he’s rotating them. it’s convenient you, stay people level vigilance &amp; concern. deserves solid portion blame, scorn ridicule attacks. Almost nobody works guy. Wow. Californian here. Wish CA like NY, Mass states really flattening curve. Good leadership people sticking rules.  yep , fuck him, fuck following him, fuck one point expressing respect admiration gigantic piece shit obviously worked China. China impose strict global lockdown? No? that's fault.

Fact is, COVID-19 quietly spreading community transmission France weeks China identified it. also hidden Brazil month China identified it. ridiculous imagine China could done anything Brazil France early. Neal McCoy going become country music pariah. dumb dont even realise? Don’t worry trump gut economic future keep things running cylinders till November like cared health staff before. start now? Without miracle, there's month half entire American economy flat-out collapses. I’m Canadian that’s nature. 

Unless red wings fan case actually fucked. likely true. Though think justifies shutting everything again. Like said, seems like media pushing narrative justify shutting down. Big businesses handle shutdowns easier small ones kids need get back school. much clear mind. Yes. 40 days way excessive. results inconsistent states....Tenn, Ark, Louisiana, AL, MS....some days post huge gain, days hundred. 2,000 years ago people lived 35, I'm sure take health lessons them... Even that's jezuz guy live past 40. skimmed saw data surgical masks practically last section. Zero data back 90% claim. data source use? Third party ones generally inaccurate cause data collected incorrectly note : comparing flu\_RELATED deaths confirmed covid deaths. dont link read USA , 50k flu-related deaths/year, 7k confirmed flu deaths time death , rest classified flu-related later on. away away acurate numbers covid\_RELATED deaths bound way larger confirmed ones “Could” thwart? thwarting effort. It’s unreal happening! locally planning go back school. insanity! thought we'd discussion?

Just add, UK government funded Oxford University research vaccine. know complicated, Big Pharma uses money fund research, think problems model warrant discussion. Like kid buying patent HIV drug raising price 1000%. There's something wrong there.

You can't deny profiteering utterly shameless behaviour pandemic, perfect opportunity put money politics one side save millions lives. south west go initial surge northeast got hit with. northeast MASS spread throughout entire region 80 percent asymptomatic, areas closer 20-30 percent infected already.

Each region eventually go massive surge infection rate exponential. initial surge, number hosts drops exponentially too. 

So yes sucks, hopefully ones getting infected folks 45 .02 percent mortality rate folks 45 regions staying safe home. high death rate ny, nj, ct, ma, &amp; pa elderly known (thanks china hiding it).

If anyone read world war z, look 45 similar nature Redekar Plan. unfortunate, pass disease. .02 percent CDC 45 pre existing conditions. small pass help save majority virus around long time US diversity could never maintained plan contact city wide quarantines. think, really. single study shown BLM protests caused aruge cases.

We thought day, raves, bust beaches. None caused spike. cases continued decline. Pensacola real ""city"" western half panhandle actually turnover population due Pensacola NAS couple larger businesses set there. isnt florida full old people retirees? demographic try wear masks? link explains backlash 2006 is, thank you, I'd rather remain willfully ignorant case. think country tune Cant talk states live honestly feel like lifted. Public transports running undoubtedly greater good saying. Borders still closed. Offices functional here. Also get cabs functional tbh cases increasing much mere grocery trip enough get coronsss :/ Also free movement people still quite restricted actually returned normalcy. Facebook alone responsible half shit least.  single reasonable person would expected happen USA. Cypress Grill district, course basically impossible enforce, I'd border checks around states let get control. reading vaccine. pretty cool platform. looks like get plasmid cells cells manufacture antigen. read brief article could mistaken. called fox news talk radio upsetting people refuse wear masks avoid crowded bars make entire US sound retarded.

You guys voted Donald Trump leader.

It's people refusing wear masks make country look stupid. It's... country makes country look stupid. Perfect I'll take recession passing another trillion dollars debt next generation  seems like US going huge stockpile date tablets, they're throwing money everywhere. certain are. Again... Major difference outside exercise people passing compared thousands people screaming. Big difference. trolling getting worse know results easily explained (by himself) simply using basics quantitative analysis, still mind blowing accurate forecasts are. Oh, nonsense.

That doctor opthalmologist, passing information labeled ""SARS"". authority COVID-19 research, whistle blower. 

He asked local government spread rumors, reasonable time, agreed. penalty sanction applied. continued usual. 

Subsequently, Chinese national government exonerated him, currently considered something hero.

I idea one, assume bullshit.  Everyone losing something pandemic. Homeowners expect same. Maybe it’s time got together demand banks government give leeway comes collecting mortgage and/or property taxes? likely home/property owners already fighting probably legislation high possibility passing Yes.

Hello trade school. people die hospital error COVID

This whole pandemic joke whole lot what's happening right now, reason massive crash fed bought trillions prop up. 

All assumption control, we're quickly seeing control. Guess happens billionaires control decide worth risk. know live, certainly majority many areas. even national level, majority people like it, they'd let known. happened.

Do honestly think Americans attitude towards public safety, wearing masks, observing quarantine say S.E.Asian countries even countries ? deluded.

No country many people blatantly putting everyone else's health risk 'I'm American means get whatever fuck want' 'God keep safe' 'its fake news' nonsense. getting rate from? Wtf healthcare family plan cost 320 month covers everything.  20 dollar copays.  

Plans like mine common obamacare came around.  insurance cover preexisting conditions equally everyones plans equally suck.  far im lucky union... unsolicited advice, don’t become lawyer! seem understand this: get outbreak extremely good control NEED test much. Norway, Finland, Iceland outbreaks extremely well suppressed. places listed too. 

Denmark bit worse testing like mad try get levels. 

Sweden rights testing WAY Denmark since Sweden's burden infection *much* higher Denmark developed EU country. Make things mandatory. Way many wearing masks. previous post literally phrase means. Right. Deaths consistent trend since mid April N.Y. peaked. Deaths consistent downtrend there. hotspots emerging places extreme degree, likely going increase deaths 2-3 weeks. thing could potentially mitigate fact elderly populations disproportionately affected NY compared places. also accused lacking critical thinking skills February people saying flu. right? Potentially not. I’m scientist, data analyst. complex cumbersome data grasp due factors involved. hope you’re right. Again, doubt protests contribution surge. unclear much.

And experience, was, mask wearing near universal. may like city. could find pictures early protests dude eating another dudes ass police car, mean dudes everywhere getting ass eaten. Actually, live Oakland work San Leandro masks distancing ubiquitous. see maskholes wear right. mostly people playing safe.  
Some parts Oakland hit hard low rent parts, poor folks keep working, many service positions, little health care probably shared/crowded living situations. people behaving themselves.

We’ve received news following Ducey’s announcement, though one coworker believes they’re waiting contracts roll tomorrow don’t send information people longer employed *really* hope that’s case can’t wait 13th get info, anxiety kill me. outcome road. folks drinking last weekend helping flatten curve think much considering many asymptomatic cases are. Abstract

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) life-threatening complication ensue following *Staphylococcus aureus* infection. enterotoxin produced bacteria (SEB) acts superantigen thereby activating large proportion cells leading cytokine storm severe lung injury. Δ9Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), psychoactive ingredient found Cannabis sativa, shown act potent anti-inflammatory agent. current study, investigated effect THC treatment SEB-induced ARDS mice. exposure SEB resulted acute mortality, treatment THC led 100% survival mice. THC treatment significantly suppressed inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ TNF-α. Additionally, THC elevated induction regulatory cells (Tregs) associated cytokines, IL-10 TGF-β. Moreover, THC caused induction Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs). THC acted CB2 receptor pharmacological inhibitor CB2 receptors blocked anti-inflammatory effects. THC-treated mice showed significant alterations expression miRNA (miRs) lung-infiltrated mononuclear cells (MNCs). Specifically, THC caused downregulation let7a-5p targeted SOCS1 downregulation miR-34-5p caused increased expression FoxP3, NOS1, CSF1R. Together, data suggested THC-mediated alterations miR expression lungs may play critical role induction immunosuppressive Tregs MDSCs well suppression cytokine storm leading attenuation SEB-mediated lung injury. Yeah, important issue needing outcry right now. Cheers. Yeah, dexamethasone good. 

But reduces death rate 20% -- super helpful silver bullet. I've got coworker constantly telling mask help I'm killing wearing it. proof say read article look up. literally said *not* advocating wearing masks. I'm saying boiling whole thing masks versus masks pretty dangerous tone conversation bewilders end national conversation somehow devolved that. 

*It's dangerous.* 

It implies long wear mask go back business usual completely utterly case. 200 250. state 5.8 million people. really like position. opinion role welfare state, protect improve conditions lives people. said could improved better urban planning, better dieting health habits (the current American healtcare system plays small part).
Now, America decided even things immediate threats. watching Canada. I’m province hasn’t new case week. I’m dual citizen born raised New England I’m scared guys. Thousands protesters hit streets cause getting symptoms soon. People believing virus hoax.. anything Canada help? Set example combat virus spread guess Cool, 2-3 years till see global roll out. Yes kill me, many things kill me, driving car kill me, vaccine probably kill certain circumstances.

But choice to:

1. Let body create antibodies controlled potential safe vaccine

2. Let body create antibodies possibly dangerous approach virus itself. makes say this? speculating know someone healthcare / government fields telling bad is? Same. would offer crawl you, given current situation probably own. :-) Newsom still ""monitoring"", ""watching"" ""threatening"", ""teasing"". Clearly numbers missing zeros. figures June 3000th. I’d settle Trump getting longer dumb argument systematically programmed robots. Another bad effect baby boomer population much vote still working cuz still cant afford retire todays unregulated profiteering problems. Even vitamin/nutrient powder Walmart, 30 servings 20 price. think maybe overwhelming reality situation also makes people deny even problem overwhelmingly serious solution would be. 

The idea global pandemic pretty surreal people probably movie trope earlier year. 

When ask people imagine 130k Americans dead think there’s real disconnect imagine it. 

That literally like filling seats AT&amp;T Dallas cowboys stadium dead bodies capacity piling extra 50 thousand dead bodies onto field. unimaginable! 

And say flu also bad, agree! want imagine add another 60 thousand bodies (estimated death toll 2019-2020 flu season) stadium filled dead Americans. 

We forced accept broken healthcare system America therefore concept universally accessible national healthcare system could addressed budding pandemic well serious diseases like flu. 

Bottom line, citizens universally allowed sick days didn’t take away paychecks, citizens equal access proper healthcare, would see much less people dying preventable treatable diseases. would also tools fight pandemics potentially trickle country.

Deja vu repeat forever Fauci gone long long time ago! stay long coronavirus-in-chief virus keeps spreading! people went high school that, died, I'd feel bad family/friends ect really actual impact life didnt really know all.

I assume they're implying comment. Imagine friends family live dumbass move Texas H1N1 coronavirus. swine flu something Lol, ya sill waiting post numbers. exist 1200 new cases city today alone. can't either, get sue'd...

its really tough situation faculties, especially majority danger age range...

I wish us students would give actual shit put efforts, instead complain every lil bitty shits things dont go ways simplest forms... mission group? trying convert people? beyond ridiculous. Yes. Speaking someone mother CT. Since Fauci, CDC, anyone else actual knowledge works completely disagrees you, I'm going go ahead say wear masks. one also saying continue practice social distancing. It’s even like even use it. wonder rest world respect them. largely agree, think there's anything wrong reinforcing good behavior everyone else. longer drags people need hear they're worth it. swear 6 degrees I'm taking crazy pills Phase 4: eat everything governor's mansion recognize said governor.

My husband facebook never (with one exception me). 40s believe lives better it. tons real friends great social life (pre post pandemic). 

My experience facebook selling old kids stuff facebook.  So, go spurts time I'm facebook 2 3 weeks every 3 5 months.

Here thing: hate seeing family friends say idiotic, uninformed, stupid things. makes feel sick, literally. stay off. 

But, instead stay on, confront BS, right?  dont feel like mental strength it. disgusting disappointing depressing.

It’s always grift. President’s unqualified son-in-law running FEMA’s operational efforts? shortages weeks Defense Production Act could potentially saved time lives?

There’s many questions still don’t satisfactory answers to. Well better dying Without financial penalty, dumb people dumb things. good points. stay safe ""In middle global pandemic last thing need stirring race issue.""

I sorry inconvenient time people think race. Perhaps people listening protests before, taken moment think Collin Kaepernick kneeling.

Your comment uses loaded language, ""stirring up"" imply racism problem. People refusing SEE racism problem protests continue. want stop, reflect fact protesters concerned racism willing go pandemic. get people actually listen them. Cases actually increased last two weeks.

Masks already mandatory TTC, look inside passing bus, half riders maskless. I'm saying. saying overall Swedish response failure aspects, especially big two: preserving health human safety economy. Even many smaller aspects failures. Put together overall failure. 

It's sort like US' climate policy (but lot less complex course). One find things mess maybe kind ok, overall disastrous. shitting Swedish health care state administration is, state Swedish politics bunch things. don’t remember feel free look up.

Ah that, ok yeah remember mention it. 

Anyway 3am Denmark? tomorrow morning? 

Whatever status, I'm going bed soonish case. Mega doses every day vitamin greatly reduce impact CoViD-91. think effective, wearing mask social distancing / sheltering place?

If people gather masks spread it. Simply making masks versus masks disaster. even make sense....maybe European several different offices send bills? hospital that's billing you? described illegal? That's horrible stay home wait till things calm actually open safely least? I’m pretty sure it’s most. Top Gun , breakout movie Tom Cruise?

I think so. Look Japan. government done shit stop coronavirus, Japanese people collectively virus pretty much control - thanks everyone's individual behaviour. Also, another important data long antibodies present for? remain body 2-3 months, case naturally ocurring antibodies recovered COVID-19 patients, would useful one would get revaccinated 4 times per year often, impractical. Keep mind seasonal virus like seasonal flu, requires one dose per year even though it’s antibodies last 3-4 months, enough get us flu season. Alright we’ll assume valid argument.

Also, Dead South Canadian bluegrass/old school country group actually genuinely love. shithole country literally imploding. press release. Increasing? They’ve flat two months now. planet live on?

I agenda, it’s flatten fear. 4) there’s lag cases deaths. 
 deaths also undercounted suspect. also think like Florida undercounting positives hoping wouldn’t explode that’s cases blew 4500 9500 day. hoped could keep lid bad situation getting learned didn’t stop lying one would change behavior slow spread. happen deaths soon won’t able silence death toll forever. really aren’t though, compared people many countries. 

It’s fun say though, lazy stereotypes go. Ther wasnt spike protests tf u talking #CORONA WANT MEH GUNS somehow people still blame protest. know moron piece shit racists believes protest buddies going getting hair cuts, eating out, hanging bars forth. Yepp. Fuck dude. cut life. 

Protests real reason shit country. people wearing masks going events bar zumba/club dances constantly touch other. 

I saw bunch old people playing cards park none wearing masks using hand sanitizer pass around fucking deck. past thinking old people going dead July. president getting tested daily! Apt user name ok, please read thread try figure meant Millions? Well, congrats achieving Darwin Award people elected it.

It appears role serve warning others. Nah man, went PA last week saw indoor dining, people wearing masks wrong. NY state folks near PA border masks optional. Maybe later fam Black Lives Matter protests cause uptick covid-19 Death Scientists starting grasp vast array health problems caused novel coronavirus, may lingering effects patients health systems years come, according doctors infectious disease experts. two later cotton mask 70% effective studies shown. also helps reduce viral load taken means likely positive outcome infected. still worth wearing one. Events section, know infection section. may giving virus much credit, seems outsmart us every turn. reading long recovery, possible relapses maybe reinfection, makes even harder assess immunity gained. recent Chinese study antibodies gained China strain virus isn’t effective European mutation. mean assumed immunity? kind disruptions cause economy assumptions wrong? Since June/July flu season?  Deaths increasing whatever matey clearly agenda amount data change mind. Bye Felicia something especially deadly gruesome like Ebola run rampant think pool anti-vaxxers would dry overnight.  see Covid-19 risk common cold, feel safe debunking it. Source? meh. masters pop music art. basically people worry people can’t given vaccine due medical problems. never breakfast burger joint. Whenever hear ""&lt;burger breakfast"", vividly remember scene ""Falling Down"" serve breakfast 11:01 breakfast served 11. remember film ended decide going burger joint breakfast worth it. We’ve instances UK minus deaths certain jurisdictions, often hospitals removing deaths counted hospital ‘out hospital’ numbers. Normally handful though never enough cause minus deaths across whole country. 

If TOTAL -41 must quite lot remove order make total negative. 

Nothing beats Spain -2000 daily deaths though Toronto roughly size San Diego. 

All Canada size TX population wise.

Totally comparable entire country    Financial ruin bitch. That's seen shingles varicella, totally unknown Covid-19. friend degree biology weakened immune system thought risk worth it. thinks got it. vaccine grants temporary immunity

Source? Lower interest rates allow people buy higher cost houses, artificially pushing market up. Well today Facebook learned death children decreased 30% recently kids getting vaccines. also taught vaccinate children, health issues all, blame vaccines gave them.

Don't try tell factual information. hear that. lost childhood bud early March. 34 healthy. hit hard. wonder I’d feeling though hadn’t personally affected. I’d like think I’d still same, it’s really difficult dealing friends really dumb asses think they’re this. guess there’s better time cut ties though...  Nobody talking churches upvote went 1.7k 1.8 exactly 1800 person upvote. Pretty cool always thought front NSA, CIA FBI; know, operating plain sight. that's paranoia me. Never seen loving soul inside one. title sucks here. read something like, country singer putting shows? whole genre doesn’t anything, except, well, GENRE! yet still go work, incredible dedication, savings fall back on. ashamed still issue first world country, too. beyond ridiculous (as whole response pandemic been). Yet again, another carbon copy headline subtext changing time. 

'American people can't live restrictions, endangers by....'

- Protesting wanting wear mask
- Using coughing weapon
- Hosting country music gigs, 1000 people. bunched selfie. Hope selfie worth guys. 
- Refusing wear mask stores, shuts local business also

Etc

The world telling things wrong.
You highest death toll.
Cant fucking listen?

Love Europe keeping America out.
You getting wrong.
RIP America Also Italy, took long time people understand direness situation. thing probably happening Texas bothers much. happens over. People wearing masks getting super close register. I'm going go somebody one day! Lol honestly think gonna like movie rented first time, damn love it. far quotable movie I've ever seen. Every single line hilarious memorable. rarely ever cases linked protests. mean exist, basically really problematic trace protest done. contact tracing teams ask, protesters definitely tell (that's trust doctors enough go begin with! Lots people paranoid pretend Rona). 

We never viable data regarding protests, pretty much settled. since community spread thing, best best look significant spikes poc communities protests took place, likely affect city wide spikes. anyone know there’s relation pressure ears corona? Feeling weird pressure ears know someone got recently I’m kinda freakin sincerely hope somebody elderly love dies it. Come talk do. 😘 visual chart shows symptoms typically experience symptomatic person early days infection, versus would feel asymptomatic (I'm assuming nothing, likely felt characteristics)? Deniers stop calling hoax reach number.

I'm sure number matters, even million, deniers. would sit front. Less people walking use restroom get bus Labradoodles eh? Breed dogs recognized breed anywhere knowledge. turn around sell 10X worth. sounds like sort sharpie (not Shar Pei) would obviously fit right pack mutts WH. 

On hand Labradoodles actually good dogs, really $3000 worth good. well behaved, live long lives, minimal shedding even look sort cute. I've never met one like. wait minute. Good dog ? Maybe fit all. Hongkonger, you’ve arrested subversion Central Party State. Prepare life prison. going waste time explaining things you. You’re clearly worth effort. Lmao it’s Chinese trolls? promoting anti Swedish propaganda again? data manipulated, got whistleblowers explaining what's going GOP-controlled ""Re-open"" college gung-ho, announced today classes person thanksgiving first step, begins Monday, following industries reopen: retail stores, child care, day camps, lodging, youth sports, outdoor seated dining. 

Mass. won’t zero deaths long. Opening anything indoors bad fucking idea. 

So unless Gap carting racks clothes outside.....

Which actually doing. Outdoor transmission damn near zilch. awesome would go shopping outside closed street? want open safely get drastic. 

Whatever do. Try outdoors. Otherwise things spike again. understand coming from, principle support Guantanamo Bay. always knew bullshit talking point, businessmen government proving hunch true. lived NYC couple years. difference friends’ Facebook posts April state live (hit less hard time) shocking. week two friends NYC posting eulogies family members. Saw couple people 30s. friend mine 4th grade school teacher Bronx writing students coping losing parents grandparents understand death first time. friends got terribly ill point. One ended hospital.

Your experience representative someone living hard hit area. I’m praying friends family don’t go friends NYC did. downright apocalyptic saw told friends there. Travel agencies country. borders closed thee way trips going happen. agencies said observing situation cancelled trips last minute - even trips Lombardia - people two options 1) cancel lose advance, 2) pay whole sum wait agency returns (which currently knows when, maybe never). people actually still afraid Chinese flu? black guy killed, media stopped milking noticed ""death rates"" stopped getting plastered everywhere. 
Also, noticed protesters getting blasted left, people concerts are? Lol Dexamethasone another much cheaper drug appears successful used similar cases. available world wide. say they're pointing fingers laughing, reality we've laughingstock QUITE time now... Honestly think public health side things.

You want everyone wear mask. get to? 

Not telling first wear them, protect others. 

No, people selfish. also want altruistic. 

In march messaging - need masks. Hospitals need more. Keep one two donate can. 

Masks help you. Nurses see flu patients wear masks. Masks also help others. 

Paper waterproof paper hat still blocks rain. I've looked ton number great comments directed me, since antibodies taken showing positive.

I Coronavirus end February. B12 crashed scheduled bloodtest March follow ups April May. concluded bloods taken everything including diabetes etc shown it. 

So B12 crashed covid recoveries get attack wherever hits. Remember free thinking evolved enough duplicate wherever sticks work. lungs, stomach, veins, kidneys - wherever really. yeah balls target too.  stated before, wanted make clear people think testing bad.

It matter intentions - matters, post perceived readers. Americans think ""See? Germans split, too. better us."" Corona Orton RCO 

""WATCH WATCH WATCH OUT!!! OUTTA NOWHERE!!!"" Coming soon US fall ~~2020~~ wait ~~2021~~ oh wait maybe 2022? 🤷‍♂️  wish true, see indication evidence prove wrong. Ironically semiannual fight window, putting taking air conditioner. Taking storm window precarious perch one thing. end putting anything glass *this* time least. 

The inside window however put usual fight. I, allies crowbar, rubber mallet plumbing wrench, finally emerged victorious, took good long time deed. sort closed window USA facing. We've many problems testing there's telling many actually died certainty. current trends make optimistic, either. hope able stay safe healthy! Aliens. swear hear baby crying right now. Even there’s mandatory mask order Florida man wear mask. shutting option. New Mexico, we’ve lot testing since beginning, think highest per capita testing back March, almost first cases came New York back reporting couple hundred cases, looking back isn’t probable. 

It must literally everywhere New York time, de Blasio Cuomo still holding closing schools issuing stay-at-home orders. think New York’s Northeast’s situation hugely avoidable.  Looking first graph, California NEVER way control. even plateau, numbers continurously climbing since march. Yeehaw Oh please wish guys would stop worry much damn chinese virus. People want enjoy summer pre Covid world, planning study abroad University Auckland next spring. American, it’s doubtful university allow studying abroad next spring, New Zealand take in. situation comparably Yet. 

#Yet#

Since measures taken, 2 weeks time. I'm sorry loss Bane:

NO ONE CARED PUT MASK Wow, macaque’s preaching converted. ask intelligent. far know handful good studies places saw bigger outbreak. studies found less 5% antibodies. population LA county 10 million. Big white ones, holes eyes. There's genocide going China right nobody seems care. US, becoming prime example handle pandemic.

Make America ""great"" again! Vince McMahon matter? infectious disease specialist I'm familiar with? not, cares takes seriously? Sad? Logical, ROTW thinks... numbers like stop meaning.

100.000 day 36.500.000 year 10% US total population year. 100.000 day means total 1.400.000 concurrent infections (ballpark) assuming ICU hospitalization rate 1-3%, total 14.000 42.000 ICU beds used concurrently. assume total hospitalization around 5-15%, leads 70.000 210.000 hospitalizations given time due virus.

After year, ""herd immunity"" would 10%, showing real effect slowing rate new infections. would live 5-7 years (!!) show effects infection numbers.

All assumes perfect distribution cases across population. course case. 100.000 per day scenario, affected regions healthcare systems see collapse. happen Houston, since ICU capacity basically reached measures slow infection rate enacted. Even everyone Houston would start wear masks, enact strict hygene adhere social distancing 6ft **today**, new infections would rise another 4-5 days least.

Keep telling others numbers. daily. Almost one deny devastating are.

#WEAR MASKS WASH HANDS!# explains it. Remember preppers claimed prepared pandemic could live months without problem? Yeah, ones crying needed haircuts screaming mandatory mask wearing taking away civil liberties. -2000 data followed sadly blatant falsification manipulation data. 

The numbers UK incredibly sad must work lower them, glad seeing much accurate, honest picture many countries. mostly blame California, Florida, Texas,

Of course states actual people going represent cases states empty land handful rednecks dotting landscape. three states account third US population.

I think NYT graphs cases rising/falling per state much interesting though Cases exploding everywhere, per capita basis least dozen states exploding rate now. Shit hitting fan everywhere. Save what?? Look stock market, USA great, theres pandemic anything strange! Speaking country music, since Johnny Cash died, anything totally nationalistic KKK like? Pfft. Buddy, way go right snorting. us useless ? Tell blacks stop killing disproportionate could thousands saved year! 

Oh, sorry, fit narrative. 

Doesn’t surprise letter mayor Leavenworth says white disease. town messed I’m guessing something achieved curve places little prepped before.  would assume one last 1.5 years based speed mutation. could wrong 3 months sounds pretty low. He’s almost certainly talking Wernher von Braun. proving easy spread since Florida America’s hospice amount death that’s possible enormous. idea Floridian politics I'd highly appreciate COVID hospitalizations would prevalent metric measure hard country currently hit COVID. number active cases volatile easily manipulable metric. Everyone office really bad illness January point one co-worker's kid's EYES bleeding coughing throwing much. Plot twist: Covid-19, that's still table. call terrorist tell get country. cant ""murica"" Hey oxford vaccine already tested years MERS?

I thought side effects already known? again, perception assumptions. You‘re biased. want read like that. 

The split may significant looks, there. can’t ignore people even minority. Minorities might grow time goes on. better understand motives.

How stated before, wanted make clear people think testing bad. wearing n95 higher public since mid March told unnecessary. opposite anti mask. point is, many people getting overconfidence cloth masks. stopped distancing thinking cloth mask protection. not. 70% effective stops 70% particles? Big difference. 7 trips 10 store risk, different 30% virus air makes breathe. Cloth masks stop cough sneezes keeps lot particles close face mask. benefit cloth masks. Distance keep safe. right I’m wondering side effects still linger? see people wearing Sunnyvale, also know people neighborhood parties, ugh. Still, bay we’re mostly better SoCal seems worry. informed virus Texas messed with. fine. /s American, approve. Shit sucks here, I'm scared leave house even mask. I'll ask third time, even though fisting would smarter use time.... provide single credible study supports treatment COVID19 hysroxychloroquine. I'm touching insane bullshit distraction unrelated topic want use avoid owning bullshit.  Millennials probably paranoid segment population right now, we're young inexperienced enough feel invincible, yet old enough ""fuck it, I'm going die anyway"" mentality. American people worst enemy Dr. Fauci said keep acting like idiots, rise 100,000 cases day  reason above, love reddit. Yep. plain stupid. That's it. Sure, listen:

 - coronavirus super common every single person earth newborn baby probably coronavirus several times before. look current amount people shown corona via testing, subtract confirmed positive newborn babies, approximate amount people provenly reinfected. 

Sometimes people really forget think huh. 

This specific article person provenly sick novel corona 2 months apart, means way long resurgence disease according WHO, hospital in, ability look strain instead warned people clearly one strain circulating local area. 

Now, since coronavirus reinfect us, long novel coronavirus first infected anybody, people felt convinced article bs, gonna spend time it. 

Everybody knows coronavirus completely common, everybody knows reinfected people year year, everybody knows certain industries want drown news seriousness pandemic, get back earning lots lots cash. 

So go ahead, keep ignoring 💀💀💀 earn lot 💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸

Literally anybody knows anything coronavirus does, knows people get reinfected constantly, people wanna think doesn't, clearly listen mind information. please tell came numbers? I've sharing post people asking questions can't answer.  numbers accurate, info extremely interesting. Ugh, Epic garbage system? 

Not really thing called bills... step dad lives one hard hit counties Florida. He's ranting face mask forcing people comply get used losing freedoms Biden takes office. He's 60+, diabetic, smoked binge drank 40s.

My bio dad ranting shadow government ran Jews blacks (I'm using word used) trying suffocate whites revenge Floyd's death somehow Hitler's involved.

Both believe covid numbers result testing. believe virus made up.

Both part keep numbers up. Probably still faster internet explorer... staying you? contact she’s here? She’s stupid following guidelines, you’d stupid let close you. trying insult her, noting control does, control response does. Fair enough, I’ll say there’s difference “thinks” had/got/caught whatever officially diagnosed though. Good point though, missed original comment wording OP’s misread original comment also cases neurological impacts, people suddenly diminished cognitive functions, like barely able focus tasks. Dead cause believe PPE preventative measures. first briefing meeting Christia Freeland eye opening. looked scared little green around gills. honest, expected bluster bravado. Seeing made feel better, knowing even Ontario’s leader would respond appropriately. ""talent"" employees they're independent contractors dude scumbag like bestie trump. care them. cares ratings $$$$. Remember everyone criticized Obama overreacting H1N1, Trump took Covid serious :/ mandate masks want ""violate anyone's personal freedoms...""

Try walking around naked see happens. Maybe shit front mayor's house.

I'm sure want violate personal freedom things. agree, feel much safer here. see friends rushing go eat. adapted quite bit, going friend's house instead. zooming still. Socially distancing groups 10 less. normal means normal enough feel like gonna end go grocery store. Lol internet big deal you, Canada might ideal destination. 3 friends MN got right away. laid covid. 2 returned (road work gym trainer). think. ship may contained medical supplies bound Germany almost certainly would also ended Netherlands too, Donald Trump ship turned around. still bungled problem. course will. even 5% cases serious enough require hospitalization, that's 5,000 people day... 10 days, 50,000 people. 

There 920,000 hospital beds United States.

The problems are, 
1. Hotspots... enough hospital beds city cover influx covid patients (on top every non-covid illness/disease.
2. Overworked staff
3. High transmission rate

Just 3 factors mean, less beds people need them. Tired Staff prone mistakes well high likelihood getting sick themselves, high transmission rate, 100,000 people day getting diagnosed likely infect least 3 people each...

It's shit show. ...you realize allow virus run uncontrolled, people working spreading it, we'll overflow hospital system right? death rate entirely dependent hospital system's ability actually hold people, moment things full, people SoL *have* opportunity survive even otherwise *would have* medical attention. 4x likely stat part that, except March part issue well still figuring actually keep people alive infected. think OP meaning say doesn’t provide sterilizing immunity; I.e. won’t prevent catching virus, macaques tested prevents disease reaching pneumonia stage (where ARDS/hypoxia/clotting issues arise kill people virus) less knocks disease cold flu-like illness (which sucks won’t kill you). Additionally, boosters would likely required, potentially vaccine sterilizing immunity became available. I’ve saying thing except wish would’ve opened week later. shut everything week ago saying, “look, briefly tried, look Texas, Arizona, Florida. I’m sorry, tried, can’t reopen.” Instead we’re totally fucked again... :( [Such flat, Maybe apply job cold stone then... hear there’s opening. Torontonian, approve message! 👍🏼 TX hospitals full, stores shelves emptied again, everything shutting absolute bare minimum. Living Boston area, see people getting tired letting masks. one guy job mental health issues (it guy know was) wear mask. tiny kids. never see people without masks unless walking outside. one even cares honestly I've seen. know Baker took super seriously I'm thankful followed medical advice Uhhh unless know something lockdown enforceable ever was. mean people ignore well fines arrests take care that. 

Things till carrot stick stick needed. think what's worrying Fauci seems imply nobody running numbers anymore. modeling stopped.

Why can't give estimate? flying blind? Pretty much every country team modelers working track R0 predict future cases. Probably combination of

* Started opening actually met requirements/recommendations (though admittedly states well)
* Despite predominantly ""blue"" state governor proactive lots pockets population think wearing masks sheeple/the new liberal hoax/unforgivable tyranny wear time think get away it
* Protests *might* issue, though ones seen masked socially distanced, opposed to-
* People really getting together groups 10+ without masks social distancing all. quarantine fatigue, people wiling take risk, people drunk deep kool-aid really believe big deal blow day now. everybody, see least one group every time go food supplies whatever. 
* People seem understand masks transmission work. see people parks standing tight groups talking laughing masks seem think outdoors fine good blasting face droplets. see people wear mask mouth nose, vice versa. see grocery store employees pull aside mask talk/shout better hear across store. isolated incidents, see three happening every time go out.
* local Sheriff even came said enforce mask requirements. I'm sure he's one. Diamond Princess 14 people die 3711 passengers crew. even 0.5%. going stop acting like black plague? I'm actually worried stat like - everyone outdoors, fairly isolated areas. mostly kids. 

Not great, could worse. say virus though, especially flu? Please considerate others stay home sick. 19 counties, OC one them. even slow start dont much testing much India poor, living slums testing isnt option   mean, two weeks solid method— wrong going two weeks ago. hadn’t reached crazy spike yet. That’s oddly specific number, headline. Trump’s Pandemic! hardly wear face coverings tend live large households Ahh it’s like cold....

... die from. What's main difference vaccine Moderna's vaccine? use mRNA seems. Sounds fun Glad took additional steps. Hopefully people take seriously, listen science. It’s frightening many wearing masks stores last weeks. 

However, I’m already seeing outcries people screaming I’m listening tyrannical dictator. going get much worse PA, scream close since could bothered wear face covering 30 minutes shopping. Gosh. Korea, restaurants, shops, cafes whatnot come contact tracing investigation, managers notified shut place deep cleaning ask staff self quarantine period. Even department stores temporarily close one visit infected person! hotspot pops map inform everyone may possibly exposed given time date. maintain trust, keep patrons workers safe, leave businesses open. one small city shut superspreading cult members. Yeah indeed. Imagine pandemic Osterholm could get message across of: virus going go away. spread 60-70% population infected. 

What also find troubling: often states vaccine within reach. wishful thinking say effective vaccine several months. even vaccine, must 100% safe needs somewhat effective. Yearly flu vaccines sometimes 0% effective, top 60%. think wishful thinking also vaccine coronavirus immediately going cure everyone.

So find troubling optimistic news 'a vaccine approved trial' kind stuff. reality many efforts result nothing... need get public know this, give 'hard truth', Osterholm states.

I wish next pandemic (which undoubtedly come) learned one, listen people like Osterholm. stupid process what’s going on. Correct also NJ CT. 
VMS signs NJDOT freeways say call 511 determine Quarantine dont like idea banks acess funds risky bets youll hate feds latest news article says they'll 400 million ready end 2020 remainder 2021. Ah yes 20,000,000 unemployed fake news. fuck that. okay evil way got here. Beacose important says acctually does, right.. Yeah, windows sure. feel like using AC blowing virus one part car Plus 15% representative population. Testing done symptomatic people people come contact positive cases, random sampling. actual rate population probably lower. Well, clear numbers general (nationally) accurate anyway, ie new Yale Study said instructor? Saying ""I'm school full time"" implies student. graduate student? Education really gone downhill. Yeah head dutch liar bullshit random redditor *knows all* Hooray politicians! I’m surprised one started making red MAGA masks. testing likely infected covid. 

More testing capture negative reducing overall infection rate expand capture people. 

Less testing, testing sure infected resulted higher positive rate test infected people  Lots people good masks. look NYC, example. 

There loads hotspots right people bad masks. They'll much better end July - lots people get sick die hotspot. Even try, hard maintain 6 ft distance people around bother. old people hands. Yes I'm skeptical ability completely isolate facilities, virus spreading freely population, going hit employees work inevitably spread. Certainly vigilance produce better results, sure delay. counties, would hard, surrounding counties also closed. Central Valley Southern California (minus San Diego that's separated Orange County huge military base, long drive.) UI equates 15$ hour months, Amazon said warehouses safe, least infection-prone rest nation. long, Amazon’s workers disputed company’s public claims. Conditions inside warehouses, said, much worse company admitted According leaked memo first reported Bloomberg, infection rates Minneapolis-area warehouse far outpaced surrounding community, Amazon knew it. I'm fine letting market decide quite frankly use Uber reason. vote using Uber buying stock. realize Taxi drivers many cities better Uber drivers. 

But everyone using product allows stock go based speculation future earnings. want prevent dont use companies.  agree, OT PT effective done remotely. Speech counseling may little forgiving. see India learning US. instead watched 400+ pound ass shovel M&amp;Ms mouth blasting Frank Sinatra signing whole trip.

Considering singing (or talking general, especially loud/open-mouthed) sure way spreading virus, combine small enclosed space would've GTFOed next red light. Fuck that. trust CDC's reporting, perhaps sources information comprises report (which article describes). mean throw baby bath water? Maybe? Maybe not? personally idea.  Obama? thought good president International examples moot point. either nice systems testing contact tracing (which don’t we) flattened curve, whereas watching rise rise. Well makes sense, big difference “barely symptoms” original title. lot moderate cases entirely treatable home via telemedicine. *number* cases, *type* cases. care poor minorities New York City dying. spiking suburban sunbelt, actually going start care. real started happen them. 

So ""real"" end July, we'll around 175,000 deaths, kinds stories local news people denied care triage situations like Italy. fans outdoor sporting events would ok (as long wear masks) Hi Ohio. didn’t work either! Ah! Thank you! people would better work? mean, *they* apparently think so, right? can’t hid hospitalizations lack ICU beds. calling freezer trucks take away dead bodies know New York Italy level fucked. 

Under report want.

Applauding researchers making proud Michigander! Completely understand that. read post came personal choice. last thing want right move, getting San Francisco high priority list.  Thank website? would like take look it. That’s literally opposite true. Unemployment requires look work keep getting money. UBI not- encourages live UBI. Except vaccines produced cost. 


They make money Oxford vaccine. God, we're assholes. ‘cause nobody wants see Corona more, want “freedom”, it’s chopped liver already stumbled answer. Carry cane. great news! today, 45k tests. Students cannot party, tragic 

 /s Yeah, great interview first heard Osterholm. yeah I've lost lot respect Joe Rogan dumbass mask positions lately. He's funny guy insightful, huge audience use share important information, smart guess comes it.  Stupid Q:

Why, look COVID dashboards, race divided white/black/other ethnicity Hispanic/non-Hispanic? trying give heads up, okay. meant say barely. 

98% cases go without mild symptoms Small businesses need stimulus help coronavirus occured WWI death rate would much higher too. Turns spanish flu killed people bacterial coinfection. days every viral pneumonia gets preventive antibiotics avoid that. made whole system could abuse it...

Bro Pull Abbott force businesses enforce order afraid implement yourself. really necessary? anyone world confused mistaken punctuation? Idk people reddit anal punctuation sometimes. would too. sincerely hope you’re able get note Dr. 

On another note curiosity, NHS work meds? seen study, I'd like point exponential curve lies flat type. likely something else. Less likely, test could false negative. Probably test use, swab tests pretty good, possibly far infection (in case, retesting help - shedding enough virus anymore get positive), randomly (in case, retest could come different).

I'd rest home see doctor gets worse. TIME ALARMED 6 FUCKING MONTHS AGO YET ARE! self promotional validity claim mutually exclusive. appreciate hearing opinion! Buying stock scummy. Allowing one country buy all, even scummier. Makes wish hell real. Big pharma fucking cancer hospitalizations decrease less people needs infected 10 days ago (mean time hospitalization infection) 21 days ago (mean time hospitalization infection + length average hospital stay). Exact number days certain many get infected days matter well, clear long delay increased restrictions lower burden hospital system. European, say this. went respecting USA wanting EU USA remain strong allies, absolutely detesting USA stands is. That's say hate *Americans* whole - absolutely aware two Americans same, nation? making decisions sane person could ever wish understand. 

Of course Europe demons, also idiots. also leaders that, now, prefer think politically and/or economically. idiots absolutely go Twitter shout face masks part plan keep sheeple down. It's, unfortunately, world wide problem.

The difference media coverage. people may feel absolutely disgusted MSM, choose broadcast certain events put much attention others. absolutely fine feel way put scrutiny meant educate people going world. However, news anchors sprouting opinions do. We, people, need hear opinions Tucker Carlson pretends bring news. get wrong, late night shows host free give opinion news fine. anything pretends mainly news, entertainment, stay away personal opinions. 

It problem virus hit. time, mostly threat society working together. whilst problem, continue thing *during pandemic*, potentially *causing death*, followers started believe pandemic hoax, bad, whatever, masks take away ""muh freedom"", becomes crime humanity, society. 

I still hope, one day, USA EU become strong allies again. now, part feels fall USA long overdue. mean unless visiting Russian cartel something, people usually pick American. course, there's xenophobes everywhere, generally hate everyone passion.

About suspicious chinas numbers. least death count. end March late. horse barn. major population areas California masks orders 2 months. California also first shut down.


California opened little hospitalizations positivity rate shot up. built enough immunity. going happen. Shutting masking nothing delay inevitable. Contact utility companies- led right direction years ago needed help getting electricity turned back on. Dear Ms. Kaye,

All US need like you, now. universal healthcare bad! /s  Corona virus barely deadly 2017-2018 flu season.

500,000 people died worldwide seasonal flu 9 months.

You want know many people die every year malaria? million. know many kids die war Africa every year? 100,000. many kids die dyssentry every year? 600,000. want know many people die TB every year? 1.5 million. many people die violent death war every year? 400,000. many die HIV every year? 750,000. many people die bodily injury every year? 5 MILLION. 

The black plague killed 25% earth's population. 

The Spanish flu killed 3.33% earth's population. 

So far, coronavirus killed .006% earth's population, almost already sick conditions. Let’s see long takes age like milk. infected virus, body contain trillions viral particles.

When give virus would maybe thousands. That's big worry zero viral particle body, initial population thousand grow trillions days. already infected trillions body what's thousands more. conservatives would demonize destroy then.

No, defeated Backlash 2006. stay away rest US ""Dumb ol' stupid Texas!""
-SpongeBob SquarePants  Trump's words, country SHITHOLE.

Our countrymen third world idiots. doesn’t make much sense. Misleading people masks wouldn’t good way protect PPE supplies. good way would restrict shipments, redirecting medical uses. early January. why’d lie masks March? 

I think much deeper failure. several going around time, example also lying Wuhan origin hypothesis misrepresenting certainty. know weren’t certain studies since shown it’s pretty unlikely origin. misrepresent that? misrepresent masks? Probably felt present confidence consensus. Instead doctors tried leaders, created conflict interest think that’s lying. know complaints mean anything rural areas trouble hospitalization low ICU openings corona virus patients need hospitalized. It’s scary man... right worry getting better first. Take care dude. Current positivity rate close 6-7%. South see start burn within next 2-3 weeks numbers go national numbers well. USA failure millennium? studied history member states makeup European Union? It’s basically 1000 years war, genocide, tyranny. 1945 onward US NATO (and later EU) things keeping peace. know thats good evil children story, theres lot grey black white. Many americans think live superhero movie hilarious. still better herd immunity?

Asking friend...  Probably thing capable himself. one person might scam it, cannot help single person /s Dr. Fauci got tired looking anti-science, going conventional knowledge, makes smarter somehow. It’s grand delusion, thinking Galileo. Also keep mind Toronto's mayor, John Tory, business-friendly U.S.-friendly politician who, along old-money pr-savvy, would never throw shade important trading partner without good reason. John Tory sprinkling anything sugar southern neighbour, know things pretty far gone. Projects show plateau slight rise happening everywhere. articles June 4th stating Texas surging, hospitals filling also. takes 18.5 days infection death average according CDC. Nothing. Stagnant. I'm beginning wonder... age groups IFR .009% 40. listing cases coronavirus COVID19 hospitalizations actually go COVID19 found there? That's death rate reflecting that? cause death would something else than. Massachusetts, Commonwealth New England. miss reading headlines involving Mayor Toronto story Mayor Toronto. say things sub. Keep facts /r/covid19 oh duh, seen that. Thank fact even commented retarded. US always welcoming refugees people different backgrounds culture, that’s news. reason, you’ve got president wants build walls keep “murderers rapists” out, he’s openly racist, many supporters want white ethno state think minorities leeching white man. must’ve head buried sand haven’t seen what’s going America. Why? right, way causes harm anyone gave people something gets mind pandemic.  need stay houses dick fair, they've reporting total hospitalizations every day long time. break new (and thus many sent home), county, except Miami. progress. Yeah, that's deceptive exponential growth is. lot cases happen short amount time *end*, something done mitigate *now*. production process complete nightmare - reactions carried extremely low temperatures avoid intermediates decomposing correspondingly low reaction rates, yields low whole process requires purification using chromatography multiple points process.

It's pretty much model stuff want chemical process need run high volumes.  Seems likely we'll race past Cali joinng surging states. Well, statistics works, all.

Clearly America significant fraction people disgusting literally give shit anyone else country themselves. Actually, I'm sure even smart enough think cared would want communities OK lives could get back normal sooner. stupid. many countries world could argue can't force wear mask, argument right fucking thing moment good human race.

I contacted jobs. None pay $9 hour. think people unemployed going work peanuts. people going desperate going take job even pay bills. biz need stop fucking greedy.

It reminds landlords rushing evict people. going live apartments now? people jobs paying rent. one rushing move city bad economy right now. pays bill? Beats me. think know experts they've seen dodgy YouTube videos. makes happy. needs wider media attention. It’s likely would close public space air conditioning, since would miserable anyways go theater whatever air conditioning. OK. trump does? flattened curve May people get sick, able get sufficient care. Less people getting sick May resulted less deaths June. uptick new cases ICU capacity getting filled, definitely see increase deaths month on. Another thing note early lack ppe health providers, many died well. think see less deaths overall before, number cases go overall, get deaths well. almost perfect example bad understanding large numbers. population San Francisco closer 1 million 100,000, numbers hard visualize course. I’m saying we’re rough spot unless get started counter anti-science campaign. knew would population would never get vaccine. 26% crazy high number able overcome Ventilator masks. going staff it?

Order cops enforce lockdowns, fire every officer refuse follow orders, replace immediately, continue making arrests issuing fines immediate crisis – matter courts state government says.

Even it’s blatantly illegal fines/charges eventually dropped, it’ll hopefully buy cities month two strict lockdowns. Where? still Los Angeles County beat 2,700 cases today. Wife's aunt died 2 weeks ago swine flu. sure covid19 breathe. feeling unwell morning died day. Authorities told us needs burned asap really contagious. 60s.

This Hong Kong. Didn’t China one vaccines? one Cornell's Community Managers? 😂😂😂 yea u tar ur brain u believe reptilians control government trump ""reveal truth soon"" soros 5G Maybe people us dirty. Treatment improved lot since demographic patients different well (much younger average). I'd ok this, say someone currently planning get vaccine immediately. Go Fund barista actually 100k now. understand campaign done.

yes felons... scenario large percentage vaccinated individuals protected virus. vaccinate risk. smaller percentage people generate proper immune response vaccinated still likely immune response would protect severe case virus. small businesses supposed covered first CARES act needs another obviously. need stop rich corps taking money. true. virus move fast. worry, southern states zero soon stop silly testing reach people disagree us? Everyone life social media reach agrees wearing mask. grocery store (in Southern California) lot people weren’t wearing mask store wasn’t informing it. get education where’s it’s needed instead sending stuff back forth people? Kids often good learning want learn, abet always. lot stuff kids need learn pretty boring, certainly it’s rare person would interested everything demand kids learn especially since school lot specific learning demands (eg learn particular bit Spanish grammar 10am 45 minutes set exercises), hard even interested good learning said topic.

This article ) goes though lot literature boredom bad, try avoid teacher, also it’s part process learning. couldn’t find exact Heckman related articles wanted, feel like summary touches Heckman-y non-cognitive stuff wanted bring up: http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/040108/heckman.shtml although doesn’t touch exactly role non-cognitive skills play actual educational process they’re built educational process. specifically wanted call perseverance since it’s important skill learning one struggling key part productive struggle, key math learning. 

As college ready, it’s simply don’t skills accepted - 50-60% US college students need sort remedial education, unfortunately remediation often doesn’t work (and we’re taking remediation it’s something like algebra, calculus). That’s really issue Covid19 though outside suggestions gives hard catch older learners need be. Take eaten back patio friend 8-10 feet apart lovely space 🙂 also major increase pneumonia deaths.... would covid want true numbers.

His story unique! many mistakes made unemployment. He'd call would full 185 people ahead him. 

I'm beginning think $600 myth. Well usually something able spread, cases daily basis tend go exponential growth. we're gnna take srsly enforce stuff like masks, lockdowns, curfews, etc. ofc going continue spreading people. see coming? agree effective shut downs isolation. shut downs possible social distancing effective. social distancing possible (meaning keeping distance 6ft) masks Asia Europe following looks like working. strange reason Americans decided masks work. Maybe explains US reached different result.

But many places [Europe make mask wearing compulsory better results US. social distancing better masks? hear too. Since listening science considered sheep? Sunshine short supply wintertime, thus less vitamin D. Plus, people tend congregate wintertime, increases transmission. Oh sure, rate cases vs deaths certainly improved, debate here. talking raw numbers. I'll thrilled see decline continue Overwhelmed hospital systems Dude like 5 internets yesterday. Got sooo messed Fuckin' WORRY I'VE DRINKING BLEACH, TAKING MALARIA DRUGS SITTING TANNING BOOTHS. MATTER CAUSE GONNA FAAAAAAADE AWAAAAAY DAY take virus testing cases lump inaccurate antibodies tests achieve whichever numbers wish. Great science got going here. 

Did know 2 different kinds tests Covid19? One test see test positive virus test see antibodies. Neither 100% accurate often show false positives.

Here’s kicker, anybody tests positive Antibodies test even currently going active Covid19 case list. 

Did know Red Cross receives 38,000 blood donations daily, minimum. Red Cross use Antibodies test every blood sample take, means testing roughly 38,000 people daily Antibodies. 

With amount people tested Antibodies going towards infection cases wonder cases sky rocketing. guy get antibody test afford it. public health authorities general colossal fucking disappointment start I'll include country (Canada) well. supposed ones look advice pandemic magnitude looming horizon, they've alternated saying virus big deal, bullshitting, waffling, going strangely silent. Honestly, 600 dollars week EVERYONE. don’t give fuck billionaire gets it. blanket population fact comment upvotes retarded lol. US allows far minorities year nation earth, fact cannot disputed. People spending money go overseas help economy spending money locally. mandating mask going fly. want dictatorship, call authoritarian mandates. damn thing. Unfortunately I’ve read fuckton available antibody tests possibility hitting old coronaviruses instead sars-cov2.

Turns people designing large scale tests actually take possibility account ... Canada Day national day Canada. federal statutory holiday, celebrates anniversary July 1, 1867, effective date Constitution Act (then called British North America Act), united three separate colonies Province Canada (now Quebec Ontario), Nova Scotia, New Brunswick single Dominion within British Empire called Canada. British Columbia, furthest West province (and arguably beautiful 😀) joined 1871 furthest East, Newfoundland Labrador, join 1949. shutdowns unenforceable, especially first shutdown lasted 3 months. dexamethasone cheaper appears much effective, maybe US put millions doses remdesivir shelves next 63 million doses hydroxychloroquine won’t used COVID-19 nothing, every single thing (should) know masks, food, water, gardening supplies. bought big pack Costco case wanted avoid others much possible even then, even three weeks later everyone else lost minds buying it. grateful pack 24 rolls lol  please quarantine two weeks upon arrival. 😅 don’t two party system like everything liberal vs conservative. would never know given feeble education system. death rate/ !remindme 4.4 years Also trip September. reason haven’t cancelled airlines don’t want give fucking refunds flight probably physically unable take due travel restrictions. guess wait keep hoping. possible, lot doctors saying mass inoculation likely won’t fall 2021 best circumstance. 

Another thing hesitance (I pro vaccines don’t construe wrong) there’s going lot scepticism fast rushed potential long term implications vaccine (whether valid not) doubt Yeah, friends idiot like that, patience I. saw articles mentioning closure weekend 4th closed reopen? biased. Understandable. point, everyone saying ""ok definitely wear masks,"" even think messed initially, also figure can't *hurt* throw mask. best I'm helping slow spread worst I'm wearing mask reason. wish here. I'm US.  might call radiant. reminds played last us 2,

I'm walking doors risking life I'm wanna live. Stay safe friend. Gotta give 'em credit though...they social distancing thing. pioneers. thing changed since 1918, police shoot people reason.  So... we're gonna die? Right. Hospitals transferring people cities fun travel critically ill. hospitals generally enjoy losing money treating patients, seeing they're 100% capacity.

Your critical thinking skills charts. Didn’t 44 say could keep existing healthcare wanted 😂 People say r/Masks4All need exist? obvious. assume live USA realize swaths people obvious to.  done currently Beijing, want travel places country WITHOUT 14 day quaratine.

You schedule test 110 RMB (15$) get result/certificate phone app next day, result valid 7 days. live county GOP gets 70+ percent votes. tiny rural, started slow. weeks ago, maybe one person 50 mask stores. People literally saying ""what worried about, hardly cases"". 

In last month, confirmed cases rose 600 percent. Trump allow Europe could whatever want.

No. simply want people wear fucking mask. can’t get deserve. chance require medical help, don’t ask it.

I believe complicated that. last year china lost half pigs african swine believe pigs caught african swine flu pigs used replace pigs culled either swine flu and/or foot mouth disease. believe pigs caught african swine flue russian pigs.

the chinese pig market seems mixture pigs world due mass cullings happened country.

germany interesting case. country lowest numbers terms infection comes covid-19. suspected there's something germany that's inoculating people possibly coming pigs. many countries europe better happen pork heavy diet.

I bet german pigs kind immunity covid-19. could generalized immunity coronaviruses. still strict rules: can't get supermarket without mask example. team sports allowed on.

Apparently that's enough keep transmission factor 1 even many constraints lifted Hong Kong city state practical purposes. India cities denser populous Hong Kong combined. Hong Kong shut outsiders, Indian cities can. still let Indians rest country. Dont worry find sex already Wearing mask decent human issue.

I've got absolutely zero fukall compassion folks want raise tizzy wearing mask. patience, tolerance, care whatsoever. one day  Unless hate speech flung liberals, it’s encouraged 3? try 10. confirm.

zero idea got numbers say could hit million less per day gastrointestinal expected. Pneumonia lung changes. Inflammatory disease. Couching rashes. Fever still common symptom. Seizures one recall correctly. Oh. blood stuff. 

Not equally distributed. Fortunately scarier stuff rare. kids resilient. rebound easier milder symptoms.

But virus super weird scary shit. there's lot kids exact problem personal level that's hard shit. Right lol? we're supposed 3k daily starting early June. think ppl realize watching exact headline month deaths kept dropping. Arizona ""almost capacity!"" headlines 3 weeks ago Texas month headlines. Millions deaths? I'll probably need entertaining 6 months I'm setting one too.

In cases say didn’t leave house month used food delivery, there’s good chance got delivery person someone working grocery store restaurant ordered from. Maybe mail man package delivery. Definitely trash. 

Regardless, many places capacity ICU hospitals, everyone part avoid spreading it.

Get common sense. 5G conspiracy theories stay. inability close borders makes piecemeal containment impossible. California could full shutdown, what's endgame? Repoening people keep bringing disease Arizona Mexico? waste time.

In mitigation scenario need essentially copy NYC, letting 20% population catch (ideally nursing homes 0.5% die), stay-at-home. pray 20% first time immune keep R&lt;1 partial reopening.

Copying Sweden would obviously better, requires social distancing impossible.  Yeah sure *barely* posts anything comes hibernation mostly goes attack subject? Pretty suspicious.

He's saying prepare vaccine winter mean Oxford get one then. makes sense would extremely irresponsible gambling people's lives based vaccine approved.

No. said matter many people thats blatant lie. many people CANT keep good distance There's 18.5 days symptoms death 7 day delay death reporting. still bit early start seeing deaths start rise. new cases start rising 9th June picked 16th. seeing deaths transmissions occured week pickup. Deaths probably starting pick hear week. might start hear hospital staff soon. 

""most deaths COVID-19 must coded person, takes average 7 days."" - CDC heat Texas, Arizona, Florida popping off, lol. Deaths usually lagging indicator we're running Remdesivir TX. People affected due economic activity, sectors others. using NYT data, reporting date tested.

Almost anyone kind retirement fund includes equity funds invested amount Gilead stock. 86 ICU beds entire county? South Korea China respond like 50 new cases pop hell even 3 - know spread like wildfire given opportunity get hold population.  


Instead wax poetic testing, negatives deaths high enough care. bad heat, what's going happen fall/winter. I'd love mods removed submission 🙄 blame people let require pants. Slippery slope. First clothes, masks. end?


Soon they’ll make us wear seatbelts cars get xrayed get planes don’t stand mask wearing tyrants  starting dawn many people fundamental problem facing America rooted institutions inequalities economics- fact America's failings rooted flaws citizens. selfish, shallow, small-minded, lazy effectively respond crisis. 

The parallels Rome becoming disturbingly apt. I'm saying put someone else's shoes. Different areas different costs living depending job usually might rely lot income most. I'm personally fine, stimulus lasted month bills pua enough help me. live shitty neighborhood that's dirt cheap get in. fiance's brother hand getting almost 1k week struggle get usually makes much can't find work makes pua pays. got job literally could survive right would lose home. what's solution there? mean, people probably consider safe short term, question marks even head comes long term safety. discover ten years line, vaccine (this boogus example) lowers fertility example? Usually long term tests studies done, thing going get one.

I'm really rooting Oxford vaccine though.  Good that. Also, sorry position. *whistles along New Jersey* Protests might issue? think people go massive protest Hollywood Blvd? Cars public transit. carpooled cars there, carpooled back. alone super spreading event. mountains. Forest gump best thing ever come Alabama reading title: 
^^*don't* ""Dr. Fauci takes mask cameras off, can't bad says"" new one I've seeing. Wearing mask outdoors summer a) uncomfortable b) largely unnecessary. Outdoor transmission big thing. far better STRICTLY enforce indoor mask wearing. actually fining people. $500 pop it. completely clueless would guarantee people would personally consider influential progressive enjoy semi-regular trip local watering hole.  can’t feed themselves? 'bout damn time!

every state rule enforce making criminal misdemeanor offense wearing one like couple places done

I know what's going US holy FUCK jaw dropping amount new cases guys everyday retarded

The US ***COULD*** like Canada 'mostly' is, wow, 30k new cases day US combined (8.3k CA alone!!!), still climbing...there literally need it, stopped people would follow simple fucking guidelines

SMH think change? backlash people wearing masks? Thanks. can't ""pray"" virus way. need mitigating actions charge...until things get worse. never fair point. vaccine existence years, changing protein covering nothing terms potential damage. depends grant immunity. I’m glad I’m triangle, sure.  fear severely underestimated idiocy followers. get everyone upset specific event. exactly happening restaurants. People flock outside, drinking beer everything. Usually even ppl smaller area. Normally pre-corona times. feel everyone would respect gravity situation respiratory illness. 

I know cases include gastrointestinal symptoms, imagine every case purely that. ebola virus people vomiting shitting death would harder ignore. 

Unfortunately easy write slight cough sore throat as, ""meh, cold"". death rate 20%, time first symptom still 5-14 days, asymptomatic rate 40%, yes, number people would still get infected.

People infecting everyone end seriously ill, they're infecting everyone they're partying bar 2 days feel sick. Hermano! People didn’t take seriously AZ start wasn’t strict lockdown surprise. think LA County health revealed 80% restaurants inspected following covid guidelines even weeks re-opening. sad fact restaurants cut corners there's grading inspections. part cultural since many eateries owned &amp; operated recent immigrants developing countries food safety &amp; hygiene luxury. Unfortunately, takes time business operators re-orient new age covid, rules need implemented next month literally prevent people dying. Yeah keep pulling numbers ass... cases high. still believe happening. Santa Barbara local theaters showing older movies plus recent movies virus last couple years - lot Spielberg, Zemeckis, stuff like that. great. People missing go. went *Superman* '78 might go *E.T.* *Back Future* coming days. *The Wretched* new theaters (went it) *Irresistible* (no way). holy crap. mean, wow. 

so evidence sources vs. evidence sources, siding evidence sources side, huh? 

I always wonder someone like would ever able admit original ideas wrong, whether looking back, could admit yourself. 

Probably not. hope point. hispanic, hell Latinx? That’s really interesting. Uber driver last week said Uber randomly take picture start/end trip see driver mask on. I'm Central California like here. many signs say, ""Mask required."" walk one mask on. even sign? think cities mandated it, they're checking enforced. someone living Ohio, I'm surprised. one taking seriously here. Families indoor parties close contact, one wears masks, etc. I'm really suprised fucked honestly lol people stubborn love summaries particularly bad flu season believe. saw pump Germanys statistics well. Germany worse Covid (but US got hit much worse Covid)

Edit: grammar  feel service industry right hope government helps pay them, unfortunately right thing right now. It’s sad way numbers get better close bars, restaurants gyms. gave shot doesn’t look like worked. keep supporting favorite local restaurants takeout. Enclosed spaces, air conditioning, people wearing masks drinking, lowers inhibitions, also causes people speak loudly, might something it.

Not say protests cases come timing lower risk virtue people outside.

The main thing though timing unless virus month long incubation period? combintion protests, bars, house parties.combination hoax. Dr. Fauci colleagues nothing better make up. Masks anything. They're nothing do. flu. many people get it. /S

And still 90% wear masks social distance. sad part looking EU, know way. need second spike. going fuck many people businesses simply President, et. al., simply refused follow science deal reality first time. point, self-made horror show. Technically isn’t wrong.


It’ll disappear become Biden’s problem soon. Red Cross blood donations get tested antibodies best part price... Free! made appt local blood bank give blood. Earliest mid july unusual. hunch I'm one looking free antibody test also find troubling: often states vaccine within reach. wishful thinking say effective vaccine several months. even vaccine, must 100% safe needs somewhat effective. Yearly flu vaccines sometimes 0% effective, top 60%. think wishful thinking also vaccine coronavirus immediately going cure everyone.

Influenza viruses coronaviruses different. Influenza vaccines less effective virus changes significantly time (antigenic shift antigenic drift). Coronaviruses that, means they're stable. So, vaccine safe &amp; effective, remain effective virus.

Also, vaccine cure -- preventative. Basically way inducing artificial herd immunity. people Internet say outrageous things get attention. Ignore trolls. Yep, wear mask best way, doubt another shut bars targeted facilities, less financial support people still party wear masks anyway, shutdown simply won’t work much cases surging quickly reopening start. mention people would protesting non stop financial support. Lmao yes people start Exactly! Meanwhile fooking applied March 21 seen dime ‘Murica, benchmark failure. ""Maybe ignore hard enough go away itself"" That's avoidable bit, though.

You personally experience something learn it. whole world learned SARS. largely didn't, that's what's avoidable. Corruption. Simple. Aren’t people property owners. don’t understand people vilify people property.  could get control, could bring back schools frequent pooled testing cohort learning. nope... people need go bars thus ability prioritize kids means nothing. Institute Clinical Economic Review, nonprofit group calculates fair prices drugs, estimated Gilead would need charge $1,600 per regimen recoup costs. much $5,080 per treatment course would still cost-effective price insurers, given patients would able leave hospital sooner. No. we’re doing. professor part discussions/planning. Yes, desperately need students stay us person online. But, want them, likewise faculty - much much risk dying COVID raw numbers - safe. want parents know kids safe here. example, don’t get start classes without COVID test provide free. teaching here. random testing. Everyone wears mask campus. many many measures - rigorous measures university I’ve seen. So, you’re going pick AL pick state - deserve - university university country. yes, verified ‘COVID’ parties. idea started think among young professionals NY city (I originally Long Island). expect we’ll act decisively way find group students done taking classes (nothing announced might look like). want see details we’re posted website. AL state lot screwed stuff. serious heart attack COVID keeping everyone safe possible university Fall. Dexamethasone produced company orange ape grubby, little hands though...

He financial stock Gilead, OBVIOUSLY he's going push Remdesivir like there's tomorrow... US get fucked ass. serious electoral consequences well. better hope Oxford delivers vaccine fast. would LOVE see coronavirus timeline map like this, that's overlain *electricity usage* analogue amount time spent indoors. 

Because addition coronavirus, sure looks whole lot like summer heat map US. bet we'd see inverse pattern March &amp; April, still cold NE perfect weather SE &amp; SW. surprised many health care workers idiots. Bump evidence extra $600 bucks week unemployed people damage virus killed 120,000 Americans? Yup basically, although Orlando huge non-college population. giant metro 2M. UCF there, yes. others smaller would represent FSU, UF, bleed-off UCF crowd. case 2 self-isolates 10 days, starts getting symptoms... four days later lunch ""many friends""?? take virus seriously enough self-isolate, still take lightly lunch friends symptomatic? support right protest matter topic (BLM, anti-lockdown, labor disputes etc) don’t think large protests pandemic great idea. attend anyone know offline, even though many us agree cause. found ways give support didn’t involve mass gathering pandemic. believe many people protesting knew risks taking believe cause worth risk. 

 also say protests saw wide open outdoor spaces almost everyone wearing mask - much different happen opening Disney World Florida. seem spreads easily outside, especially many people wearing masks. haven’t left apartment except absolutely needed. gave trillions corporations. Yes, looks like that’s Wall Street estimated mistake fear intelligence think correct that: CoVid weakening people start issues due pre-existing conditions people start blaming ills CoVid actually pre-existing conditions, sometimes undiagnosed, causing issues.

How type come conclusion covid blame? may pre-existing conditions covid set off; conditions circumstances would've never set off. wish r/conspiracy started talking aliens again. days. Yes, looks like that’s Wall Street estimated wear mask, should, terrible idea shove things people's throats, simply work. Also, fact conversation, probably two Americans, show everyone dumb America. yes, please please please see us example dumbocracy-My rights rights!!! every human alive facepalmed unison still would enough facepalming. 

This man deserves absolute worst. Yea pulled T-shirt going less effective bandana, workers every right demand better ppe customers especially owners orders.

Leave thread source claim Thanks, live next Leavenworth Kansas thought local story political bias exhausted made go ceremony cant even quarantine cruise ship full sick people correctly. think mistake brave stupid. Yessir. Cuomo touched recent press conference really heartened hear going 2009. conspiratorial minded public, really go first shiny object latch like lives depended it. They'll catch year two we're going explain divisive anti-maskers, missed pillaging America consolidation wealth power. Use smaller words explaining though. Nope...she may never gotten rid it. probably go ahead copy/paste headline day next weeks. jailable offense. Honest question, isn’t standard? We’re middle pandemic, isn’t exactly time worried transparency. It’s also HIPAA violation. Saying “This county 3 COVID hospitalizations” zero personal protected information. best, informs public actual extent outbreak. worst, it’s red flag countries deep are. honest, every country world already knows this. think accurately publicly displaying extent COVID US puts us foreign risk, we’d fools think countries don’t already know this. America needs transparency we’re dealing virus. Hiding piece detail hurts us. point even die living what's left body sucks ass.

Can link data show permanent damage side-effect people recovered Covid? set go fund me? would contribute. It’s good move. Wish US would nationally. Must pretty far reaching conspiracy get every country planet 448 deaths May 16th indicates IFR 0.79% 3 countries countries, Brazil, India UK screwed Europe, Australia, new Zealand, South Korea Japan handled covid well. believe China's numbers they've also handled covid remarkably well population size.

You can't compare people worst act like fine. refs would issue, definitely agree there. world overflowing people qualified ref NFL game. would require significant monetary solution would make worth give jobs it. Refs getting paid would nice thing come this, concede would problems like could make harder get done. still think could get done. without money, plenty NFL. Appreciate response.  Trump mannerisms chart. guarantee watches Trump speeches tries mimic them. could made millions MAGA facemasks honestly wait new season south park start. going amazing. Ah, arrogance stupidity package. efficient you. Bit asshole? like full blown assholes Instead US cases single state, NY, (really single city, NYC), coming dozen states. see containment happening anytime soon. Spending need cut needs reallocated. 
 
Taxes NEVER lowered unless dire situation demands (I agree might one times incentivize spending), tax codes need changed. We're #1! (at sucking) No, that's insane. surgical masks? Even better. even filter air coming towards you, depending snug fit. reliable protection corona, it’s even better cloth. CARES Act suspended typical unemployment requirement looking job accepting available employment, really arms it, could simply ask rescind requirement without away added benefit generally. Cutting revenue stream people work TERRIBLE idea. need consumers money pockets. don’t it, businesses suffer lost revenue rent mortgages go unpaid. snowballs. nice person. extremely sick earlier year and, recently, chronic chest pain. nothing i've posted false -- i've posted lot opinions theories, Reddit that's generate discussion. take care, bro. It’s funny everyone disses conspiracy theories they’re told to. don’t people try going open mind look things talk themselves? Conspiracy theorists called crazy figured pizzagate sex trafficking issue. got one correct, perhaps could correct ones. didn’t believe conspiracy theories realized something wasn’t right situation. got taken Russian Trollbots around time The_Donald spamming thanks Russian Trollbots pretending 4 Channers.

Then morons chugged Q_Anon kept going place make feel stupid believing stupid things. I’m sure numbers higher testing requiring quarantine people exposed positive covid case unless symptoms. also transparent contact tracing told community exposed. 

I agree event huge draw near communities events canceled. 

It’s frightening it’s handled here.  guy said grandparents willing die benefit economy grandkids.  nutjob. comparison almost makes Abbott look responsible. completely unacceptable! one put kind abuse. live world considered liberal pos wear mask. Unbelievable, surprisingly normal price treatment new brand anti-infective drug. set paradoxical compliance behaviors programmed public deep state media injections using subliminal steganographic-adjacent techniques.  Well probably today even, tomorrow. High R factor, exponential growth all. people seem missing much money drug save insurance companies/individuals/hospitals. remdesivir gets hospital \~3 days sooner, estimate saves 10k-12k care costs. Seems like pretty reasonable price context. Sorry! Never heard then, can't find google maps unless way Austin :)

Oh well! Cypress Station Grill mix cajun texas home cooking, got shut replaced kind bbq place. Ignorant reporters still think death. future health issues going biggest problem. Yeah Tesla saving for......I’ll buy corolla live near Leavemworth know # people there. Though friends super left gun owners town primarily purple, east go redder gets Wasnt $5080? Im little confused much treatment actually cost said cost (it mentions investors deemed reasonable 5k price per treatment dosage covered insurance) Woe that's great graphic. lot counties less 10% ICU capacity left, lot counties approaching general capacity too. Looks like Orlando Tampa Miami Dade getting hit hard. Ah, okay. 

Agreed, he's incredible guitar player.  anyone wants see them, go YouTube.

Yeah, seems make good combo sort thing. Yes, strength military strength average citizen 👍 believe motherfuckers known new disease months dont figured out? virus we’re talking do, lot people think goes away April, heat, heat comes in, typically go away April,” Trump repeated later group governors. pisses aswell. lockdown 2 months read doctors claiming ok.

People wear masks wash hands keep social distancing. That's it. saw happened US. Go hide cry cave scared. isn’t deadly virus 50. 

Those us brave going keep living. 
Go suck thumb hug mom feel better *We live era stupidity* Lol Apparently that’s already price patients private insurance don’t. It’s something said. workers virus come know? fucking while. really shameful culture country destroying inside. Tennessee averaging 1000 day past 3 days. That's around 400-500 day 2 weeks ago. governor failure. Got it. hopefully priest wearing mask Cool, blame kids, leaders clearly less concerned people dying giving us signals it’s OK stay home safe. Oh stop glossing major facts. 

That licensing agreement permits distribution 127 countries, significant obstacles healthcare access. 

The 67 first-world countries fucked Trump Gilead. Murica. could charge us breathing air, would. Nothing free land free, it’s actually expensive. kind tool false sense security enable people things normally wouldnt. ""Well, county way better rest, surely go without mask w/e want""

Forget stupid websites STAY HOME.  ""You can't tell do... something go wrong fault!"" town Belgium, every single billboard advert replaced coronavirus PSAs. Even little #staysafe government covid site link, everywhere. 

It pretty impressive. suggesting mingling sleeping cruise ship weeks riskier outdoor, socially distanced, masked protest last couple hours? Yeah okay dude. tell real serious thinker. Never got bill, legit here, I’ll totally hook pro-bono lawyer area got bill. Unfortunately that’s really possible depending live. feel like extra $600 unemployment took care laid off. 1200 stimulus check, given everyone whether still employed not.

Now, shit show was/is file unemployment complete failure states.

I keep hearing dumb stimulus check was, yeah don’t know going good bad effect economy long term, sent stimulate economy, replace usual paycheck. 

A lot us never stopped working, maintaining steady pay. Even workers hours cut back could also file unemployment, compensate lost hours. 

TL;DR stimulus check one time unemployment (+600) still available laid work Well basic logic would tell everyone getting corona also getting tested.

There lot asymptomatic cases Hint: OP /r/conservative poster, posting Fox News article that's trying exaggerate spreading among protesters. causes pneumonia deadly cause life long damage absolute fact. another example, seen articles women Covid lung transplant. Life long damage well. Also check picture article lung took out. clearly lungs never getting Covid. Take bank, absolute Flu Caused Permanent Lung Damage state never disappoints stupid I've always protest. cool. one said reopen either. Wtf talking about?

When data comes specifically hospitals right dies, truth come out. absolutely stupid time protest. Healthcare already stressful job without pandemic. really feel EMTs ER staff, etc. got extremely stressful well loved ones. (My previous comment political removed)
 
I cannot say people board yet.  Many AZ still consider mask wearing/shelter place partisan issue. 
 
The response measures well documented response AZ whether support support protect measures. That's clearly implying. saying airing many stories every day, intentionally not, acted essentially anti-lockdown propaganda, turning people lockdown, best interests. honestly think angry *situation*. take people wearing masks people make ""real"" visibly taking seriously. They're really tantrum reality what's happening. can't yell viral pandemic yell people. Yeah logic this? Another marathon runner. Dude stuff scaring Canada. mean close even avoid this. certainly mind break even either, also mind profit. That's business. comment said invested billion, estimating $1B revenue single product 1 year, happens next? think drop affordable pricing point? history tells us anything, answer probably heaping no. Insulin, EpiPen, etc.

Edit: correction, another comment mentioned $1B number, bad really work ""not ideal"", completely unsustainable. There's reason teaching full-time job, people can't handle top existing full-time jobs. enough hours day, particularly demanding job multiple uncooperative children.

Believe me, tried 3 months spring, disaster. hire nanny/tutor quit job, never attempt again. Yeah, too. They’re screaming everyone’s faces tyranny seatbelts...I mean, masks. Students indicated coming back Ithaca regardless (which makes sense considering can't get housing they're complaining depression home), Cornell like every top school, they'll allowing vulnerable faculty staff continue work home. testing enough would already well past it. realize many successful operations run deficit ability borrow money seen liability. example person pays Bills credit fees regularly good credit score, allowing borrow money someone credit. Alternatively, despite national debt trillions US, entire countries use us dollar national currency.
But yes, revenue stream high unemployment suffer hell get day response? DUN DUN.. DUN..DUN DUN! *One death tragedy; one million statistic.* article says 50% get neurological **symptoms**, damage. common headache, loss taste. data often severe symptoms show (aphasia, strokes seizures) I'm assuming they're quite infrequent compared first two. Still, disease something take want go liberal slum continent anyways. ones?

cause seems like effective leadership atleast partly cause, creates interesting paradox society becomes advanced enough population largely ignorant protections think mask read “KGB”. ""We realized going lock need serious PR keep people freaking out"" whataboutism tired. explained many times discouraged cannot legally prevented. assure minute vaccine gets approved, medical manufacturing institutions world ramp producing it. ""They told come back tested,"" said Quintero, also told would need document primary care doctor directed nearest emergency room testing practice coronavirus Corona Regional Medical Center around corner house Corona, Calif. tests either, nurse tested breathing gave chest X-ray. testing, nurse told go Riverside County's public health department. There, public health worker gave 800 number call schedule test. earliest county could test April 7, two weeks later.

I think country works virus. Everytime see reddits, always think ""I Duddits"" studies, quite sufficient me. may afraid draw conclusions rock solid deductive reasoning handful studies, not. fail make conclusion fear out-of-step majority, something fear. fear illness much majority thinks. every business dude. state offices open information workers still working home.

New. Normal. I'm sure upset downvoting everything say. 💋💫 Canada has, know. But, ""stay home"" started here, CERB started too. ""Canadian Emergency Response Benefit"", got money people working covid19 fast.....2 3 days. $500/week, kept bills paid food table. stayed home, unless needed go grocery store drug store. ""do-able"". US, think happened. one check $1000, right? That's going go far something like this. ..0+  “Wearing fabric masks face coverings keep unknowingly spreading COVID-19 virus keeps people around spreading you. respecting protecting other,” said. “It may uncomfortable. may look unusual. may take comfort zone. say that’s true me, wearing mask regularly recent times. doctor says works.”

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Poor choice words guy wants hang Tom... Couldnt mean flu deaths reported covid deaths covid deaths noted pneumonia deaths? Math read article? asked students vast majority planning return town (which means visit bars, go frat parties, etc.) regardless classes online not. they're coming class, least school regular testing tracing. I'm starting think support Swedish strategy simply reading comprehension issues. although article discusses cases imported, one discusses interior Minister's proposals **about imported cases**. Namely suggests tighter controls may necessary. One more, graduating bold XL bold clear you:

#""If health authorities consider situation bad, get similar messages Department Health Welfare Ministry Social Affairs Health, course, government, consider whether restrictions need introduced,"" Ohisalo said. Unbelievable. 

 (But really.) Yup, bring gift home share family. stop reading friend mines posting. blcok to. 

that got crazy vulgar. 

the dude lost covid happen. shame to. enjoy talking this. basically peddling idea black people irresponsible. Also hospital contributing protest even though black people dying disproportionate rate months protest, that's good example many black people trust medical community U.S.  smell that? smell bullshit. read article you’ll see he’s optimistic it’s matter when, we’ll get vaccine. Overall tons experts believe we’ll multiple vaccines 2021. likely reflection age. Texas youngest state union. get saying, fuck Jets! report her?

If someone violates quarantine they're hit $4K fine. Took long thank god. oxford's supposed done half time News flash! got huge loans. ""If read social distancing!""

Not without force law enforced (punitively) behind it.  groupies idea much us dislike wanted succeed this. wanted prove us wrong use massive power stomp thing. gave credit backing first stimulus. I'd definitely give credit right thing turned thing around, fear might late. They'd say put mask make people feel comfortable, thought needed. US states close rest country late that? NY enforce this? 

Every Australian state except NSW/VIC closed borders back March enforced roadblocks. worked wonders stopping spread. making extra dime quickly cares rabble dies? can’t build strategies something can’t measure though. Cheap liquidity unlikely get otherwise still bailout. taxpayer facing risk default. trails closed?

Edit: Apparently got downvoted asking question Sure is. There's surge new cases, ask new infected people 2-3 weeks ago, say ""parties"" instead ""protests"" know blame.

(Please watch movie already) Ah. cause effect slavery. one said decisions made pandemic going easy. main reason still check Facebook I'm waiting see karma ever shows bites certain people ass.

I imagine telling tough shit, brought yourselves, I'll probably send best wishes speedy recovery like everyone else. thought protest dumb fuck. years rise never mattered unto months stir crazy lockdown. 

I've heard argument. bullshit. 60k protesters Houston y'all reduced COVID19 spread ppl going out? surging everyone staying in? Trash That’s despicable. Bar flies want inflict misery one entire world. second hand smoke, drunk driving, domestic violence, drugs, lifestyle disease, crime. I’m fucking SICK it. choose lives right inflict rest society. disgraceful. shitty thing shitty thing support. Deplorable, indeed. excellent news.

Inovio look track confirmed vaccine release year ! Arizona fairly late start getting Coronavirus cases, combine 50th testing long time, think bred false sense security. hospitals full *their* hometown, think people slowly beginning wake up. majority still wearing masks scoff see wearing one, there's steady increase mask wearers last days. That's basically study did. there's robust, widespread method testing cells yet, unclear much protection provide, someone still spread disease cell immunity, etc. saying, Rob Ford premier. people remember, Rob Ford crack smoking former mayor Toronto (lol) dead - cancer, crack. 

Our premier Doug Ford, brother, widely seen loudmouth idiot least competent listens experts. Low bar lol. caught H1N1 went around. Absolutely kicked ass 2 weeks, another 3-4 days get back going back work.

June 10: 731 Balaclavas Umm pretty sure Trump said testing CAUSES cases, dummies. stopped testing would go away! Wake sheeple I'm sure isn't. Lol, wear mask 5 hours factory AC PA hard. aint gonna happen people dont give shit ignorant dont trust government fauci.....which sucks  like portion country near suicidal. I’ve read, tracers ask people open-ended question. don’t go list 50000 possibilities. 
     
Most also don’t specifically ask reopen protestors, rallies, concerts, anything else. dont people watch work count dude. work home. think hubris. took stand, opened quite wrong. loathe admit egotistical acknowledge mistakes.

being Governor Texas carries little actual power. except seemingly case declaring state open closed. Abbot got dead wrong refuses acknowledge mistake. also course worried deplorables might protest . Yeah, hardly anyone wearing mask protests city. I'd say maybe half mask somewhere person, either chin-strapping nose out. basically, might well one all.

And we're starting spike now, even though city never got phase 1 reopening started going back up. Gee, surprise. I'm guessing bringing hand sanitizer wipes?  Looking numbers I'd say disaster well course maybe give 2-3 weeks hospitals look like warzones see traumatised healthcare worker crying cause see day people struggling breath filling every corner hospital workers fear infecting family. Lets put way: Even $600 week end July, Floridians max (if got max possible amount!) $11,100 year. trying hardest attribute every death every thing covid

This exactly look excess deaths making comparisons, best way avoiding effect. Otherwise rewarding countries fudge numbers (look graphs Peru Ecuador, need know exactly many would died know graphs show) punish ones (Belgium). Less 20 years ago, say third world countries legitimately insanely poor. Since then, third world begun catch lot... average living standard average American gone almost nowhere thanks ever-widening inequality, making said increasingly true. :/ even stay close knit group, you’ll need get hotel room, visit stores, shit could get infected country UBI place numbers?

You also forgot mention wrong unemployment, incentivizes going work requires trying find work receive unemployment. I'm masking would even bar Restaurant? plague rat San diego sub talking going driving hundred miles one counties shut San Diego.

Why?

To look ocean window restaurant. 

They live beach county too, access ocean want.

You severely underestimating stupid selfish plague rats are. I've working wife furloughed. got call today saying officially let go.

F. still fell slowly IHME model predicted. get Rt well 1.0, whatever reason, active cases fall exponentially. Whether virus can't get susceptible people active measures keeps trying infect people immune first, math looks same. hear lot, too. frustrating, particularly work likely expose others other. Sigh. They'll safe sun goes down, rona strikes. similar issues first, seems cleared now. It’s scary. sucks grew wealthy family don’t know bad healthcare is. mean, I’m insured, work job deals hundreds kids nothing. immediate eye opener. thought read numbers like Arizona morning.  need cap previous salary was. 100% favor extending benefit, really fair working front line jobs making less.

Above that, think government give everyone another stimulus check reaches grocery store workers, nurses, etc. now

Did drop /s?  disagree, I'm curious think work long term. 2 months locked followed 1 month phased reopening indefinitely vaccine? European Chinese vaccines frontrunners? live US I'm ashamed shenanigans like this. rest world, please accept sincere apologies. Neither US Gilead allowed get away this.    obvious statistically time Texas lying death toll. CFR to-date 1.5%, completely implausible context either rest world rest US. Vote dumbass anti-science GOP. killing us anyways climate change denial somehow want accelerate process. said joke think US ***RAISING*** it’s citizens quality life. means people better today 4, 8, 12, [x] years ago.     
I thinking along lines maybe could argue whether peoples lives average gotten better last maybe 10, 20 years. Maybe even better since 60s push.    
If push line [all way far justify people’s lives up.... well. Think says stance.      
Red would framing whether US raising QoL. Blue framing. Trump wants dead. Mali ICUs Bamako. Timbuktu 500 miles north middle Sahara.

I pray Malians need close malls, gets insanely busy local mall one social distancing  makea sense. inasmuch want legit, can't find anything else corroborate it. fact coming head Dutch CDC, hard find it. can't become billionaire it. Asians do. things life trying figure massive group people prefers something not, answer almost certainly “it depends”.

I would imagine though Latina Spanish speakers would prefer correct gender noun used, I’m white dude hell knows.  ah always thought scenario, know official name. El Dorado county gonna shut next. We're overrun people escaping locked counties. No. ESPN Dan Patrick. Dan Patrick radio host former sports bar owner: this, understanding, seems safe? Legitimately asking I'm pro-vaccine, speed vaccine worries greatly, since we're cutting ton time testing. I'm completely sorry happening you. horrible thing imagine extremely careful. rare get see people? Family? think fair assessment situation. someone working paid certain amount cover regular expenses lost job looking, wanting govt pay bills. job going cover bills outside skillset, literally point taking it. take precautions I'm shutting 18 months either. 

Of course ridiculous people made political e.g. wear masks cut highest risk activities, see people people afraid leave homes see family friends all, strikes irrational extreme. That’s true. people know appropriately quantify risk. 

I saying COVID isn’t horrible obviously best stop spread humans face risks every day life. 

Just add COVID list.  I’ve always loved living Mass/Boston...I wanted move away harsh winters...but seeing leadership vs states, I’m like nah I’m good, I’ll stay. want point CDC initially advised masks. (I wear mask way; playing devils advocate). good New Zealand, sure, not. not, /r/moronavirus.  North America comprises US. ever heard Canada?

As expression essentially means you’re moron well thinking US equivalent North America. That’s like referring Germany Europe Asia China Especially people like saying situation bad US. What? 98% infections stuff directly coming dutch cdc. Yup many East Indian friends think weird wasting money girlfriend house, brother wife kids house, sister kids live separate, parents etc always ask always live different houses. always tell basically truth, like privacy girlfriend sex living room, kitchen etc whenever want lol No: posting facts dislike cannot disagree facts.

Truth real world: ultra-majority unfortunately include (knocked recliner 6 days due CoVid-19 make nose fountain blood last day sick) parents (deceased due CoVid-19 effects/after-effects) 'just another flu' use term get attacked proper terms use. yea agree perm. lock til vaccine comes out. lose whats left already lost mind. Yea fuck Latin America, Asia rest 3rd world, let die shithole Countries... might time count costs US causes inconsiderate bully rainy day... sure it'll start add quickly. feel 76% increase 7 day average 10 days sharp, know say.

Well, depends base level was. climate refugees? Actually people died car crashes lockdown usual. think fewer people roads, speeding reckless driving White House always hiring. news site, crack heads access internet. mean, they’re still learning not? We’re pausing anything putting classes online. We’re making safer everyone involved. taking virus seriously get go, wouldn’t conversation. it’s we’re getting rid anytime soon. 

There’s another whole argument economics college town collapsing, healthcare systems could collapse easy. isn’t good answer here, don’t think letting bunch college kids go back safe. Based numbers quickly fell off, looks like NYC, Italy, Spain may already fast-tracked it. KDKA stated required outside unable 6ft away others. air always smells like chlorine around swimming pool made response u/ragingnerdaholic might clarify situation.

I mostly made post bit tongue-in-cheek, four-year olds intentionality behind actions—there’s difference typical boundary pushing/curiosity reasoning four-year old uses. I’m Baton Rouge. 
All anecdotes sound made silly. 
I people pull mask pocket purse. tell I’m right thing wearing mask put back got it. don’t care people think me. people terrified odd one out. one else wearing mask don’t either. It’s honestly behavior expect insecure high schoolers. grown, especially risk adults old enough grandparents. forethought bring mask utilize it. reason “it’s flu” still thing here. Like dude don’t want get flu, don’t want shit either?? 

I go Costco establishment “enforced” masks. 

Look, it’s hot humid fuck here. Wearing mask outside, even walk house car SUCKS. outside aren’t close proximity ok, go thing. Inside excuse people manage find one. Almost were... designed! True.

What sucks people made sacrifices needed, people didn't, caused efforts useless. crazy many people deny virus even exists, refuse wear masks social distance, etc. casinos closing? Cause things covid factories. doctors/scientists give estimated timeline vaccine's release (assuming works), given rush put it? 

I realize lack information necessary make accurate projection development team shied away projecting fear misleading public. But, one's holding random reddit projection accountable, curious anyone working field educated guess timeline rest us. Dunno car accidents great statistic cite point. Road deaths actually went lots places due people driving recklessly assuming roads going empty. actual data side, cast doubt whatever data exists. critique methodology used, rather invent methodology think would good point using instead. Definitely link sources make claims.   see ""Florida hold beer"" number June 28 18,157? keep madness? ""no worse flu""

I mean, compared Spanish Flu (turns blue, fills lungs fluid drown) bad.

Compared usual seasonal flu? goddamn Horseman Plague Pestilence (combined locust murder hornets...) Haha bad doesn’t take detriment wearing one That's kinda big deal states right now...... US badly... high? think pretty much take realistically. Hope repairs something would damaged completed? Probably go forward. 

The plot land saw cleared foundation poured lockdown? Less so. also fencing companies installing new fences period. Probably essential. I’m poking fun them. think it’s fucken tops. mvp award crying loud Deaths starting spike states increase cases began early June. Look either Worldometers 7-day averages, state-by-state, details try details page state (Florida, Texas, Arizona, California, especially, also Oklahoma, Nevada, Georgia, SC, NC, Mississippi, etc.)

The main reason deaths still trending nationwide states big outbreaks April seeing benefits control efforts May early June. states even appear test-trace-isolate programs place compatible reopening.  bets many people skip next county want something eat out? way.  medical systems overwhelmed,

Were they? run ICU beds? 'covid 19 dangerous average flu season' opinion based. stuff stone hard fact. Thanks. Weigh risks people around you. going, going seeing family anytime soon? workplace again? otherwise constantly wear mask public? Think catching it, would potentially transmit to.

If good health, around others days, get tested interacting others, massively irresponsible choice go fun. Yup, peon. way pay taxes pharaoh (no money back then) field flooded nile anyway. Wow.

Average flu pathogens, something white blood cells attack destroy. 

The novel coronavirus attack destroy white blood cells, get rid virus, immunity system reacts attacking human host cell destroy it. 

If average flu wave, Italy would gone thing, average flu wave. concentration (titre) virus allowed grow higher, people suffer real damage, white blood cells destiny host tissue get rid virus. 

People put trial crimes humanity spreading nonsense like that. like hard understand. know meant call luck. government deferred experts listened basically shut March recent. made sacrifices needed able little freedom back. Edgy People careful. things open doesn’t mean get back normal. safest thing avoid gatherings people. RemindMe! 30 days Sure, % deaths better figure total number? large number old people year? cure! saves couple days hospital. big deal! certainly possible. Inflammation extremely common response COVID cases.

But pneumonia non-traditional. disease process causing rashes COVID toes thought causing lungs slowly fill blood. symptoms mild occasional coughing. Especially previously healthy adults whose immune systems stronger.

Given transient fever, think prudent consult doctor. companies hedging bets already producing it.

Sounds like LOT money made! Looking big picture, BLM protests going long time, one paying attention. Now, people finally starting care. amount people various races seen protests shows catching on. School districts conversations race equity. 

The timing sucks, now, when? deaths weeks old cases, pre-surge...just wait, Governor blood hands soon. listening audiobook version book day, interesting stuff. day!?!?

Lmao welcome 4 months ago Canada. said every automaker listed three. Honda, Toyota, Kia, Hyundai, Volvo, Nissan, Fiat-Chrysler, ect? explicitly mention Theme Parks say Family Entertainment Centers (are same?) 

Has back house theme park worker, hope remain closed now. safe none friends work theme parks want go back. point go from, must flatten curve one get virus? contagious virus, going spread. transfer ICU patients, stabilized patients. transfer equipment. overflow redirected ER. hope learn mistakes better outcomes even that. Deaths declining faster cases 2 months now. can't explained lag point. don’t know expression, I’d like understand it.
It’s north america land ocuppied canada usa, Idk part mexico north america, guess is. Anyway, don’t quote it. us favor tell co-workers stop wearing thier scrubs outside hospital. two months everyone would complaining Feds prepared ordered enough drugs. research universities make ton money things like patents. appreciate testing reference haha..

Lot's athletes already tested positive. Hopefully giving vaccine people already recovered virus (especially tested positive qPCR test). 

That seems like waste vaccine that’s phase 3 is... large scale human trials

and they’re changing enough components cause long term damage, main concern provides immunity. 

if starting scratch would worried long term consequences.

edit: either way take chance want. covid proven long term health consequences. vaccine existence went year long trials past none. change protein covering match covid 19 virus. Viruswaanzin group lower intellectuals demonstrate covid measures Dutch society. obviously group zealous conspiracy believers turn facts around agenda. skip article please. 10% family infection rate info back March. Honesty, 84, may give much fuck either.

While definitely high risk, years life (statistically), may want spend one locked house. made comment day! seems logical Russia behind it. one gains anything Americans refusing wear masks, except enemies. also divides us.  amount lack pride America Americans baffling surprising. many tests? New York situation months ago ridiculous unprepared state US considering warnings time. state prepared several months clear warnings beyond ridiculous, Negligent! Hitting reset button here. come back, absolutely reason continue working home, pushed continue working home actually offered basically double workload. got met bullshit excuses ""what need ask questions"" ""it fair let work home others can't"" I'm back scrolling reddit 6 hours day ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

&amp; they'll also losing one best employees weeks I've saved bit guy Australia used car cover. Here's link actual CNBC providing even clearly stating study referring to...)

The Financial Times followed methodology many countries, found results Unlikely, would seen China Italy case.

True plot twist another six months: going realize CoVid-19 ultra-majority, speaking someone lost parents it, **is another flu!**

The exceptions rule like parents make rules based on.

The elderly, P-E's, living two groups told ""Stay home!"" order let people live lives.

Requiring mask okay... shutting everything not. Shutting bars okay. Shutting indoor dining okay.

Shutting everything 'non-essential' big viewpoint thing? okay. wear masks, maintain social distancing, go touching things (like beach balls badminton rackets food plates/utensil boardwalk railings umbrella handles or, well, list goes on), walk block's distance every 5-10 minutes, average spend 2 hours there...then sure.

I dunno much fun they'll though. That's misleading many great data, look link sent rating website. Look Florida's data compared California (which weirdly gets criticism sub...) Ok. still wash hands, wear mask keep distance. Staying home forever living either. Long winded way saying insured access uninsured. Well TIL. Guess makes sense. Even US seen way certain extent. thought line bit funny. I'd love thoughts. Say vaccine ready sooner rather later ... mother extremely high risk due neuromuscular disease severely weakens lungs. someone high risk rush take vaccine moment becomes available would wiser wait out? hear lot suspicion taking vaccine ""too quickly"" knowing adverse side-effects, worry even know potential adverse side-effects years anyways. think? Shortens bedstays narrow set ICU patients. 

This *is* thing stock country happened botch initial response danger overwhelming good chunk major metro hospitals. 

This like buying buckets town rainstorm never fixed roof. enraged anyone else needs bucket, really solved problem. 

But maybe youngest children cheer yay, dad bought us buckets!  300 deaths average vs 1500 deaths year 5 fold increase, 500%+. numbers I'm seeing double quintuple five year ""right sort immune response"" exactly scientific data. bff’s mom got tested 16th. able talk someone 26th, still hadn’t heard back, said prioritizing presumptive positives (my friend’s mom didn’t symptoms besides fever) couldn’t say friend’s mom would finally get results.

As today...my friend’s mom *still* hasn’t gotten results! Luckily she’s able isolate work home, still! assumes lost sample. :/ PT got far. literal bones place pulled muscles overworked. 

A physical therapist going put tailbone back place rib. week later I’m already less stressed, happier person. Comment teeth showing smiling? Newsom said opposite that.

California public officials, least, science deniers.  gun shops sold military grade bio-warfare masks. government imposed minor fines wearing them, everybody would? ""mah freedoms""  environmental perspective sure, treatment labor ethical concern too. Audi, BMW, Chevy, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Smart, non-US sellers EVs ""Fuck government"" corporations control government want think. want meatshield true blame. 

But apparently ok long sell Funko Pops change Twitter icon LGBT flag while. No, didn't.

What caused parent's death fricking rehab center committing medical malpractice sending father home CoVid-19 Mom back May. 

The bleepers CoVid-19 test even though 3 cases nursing home part rehab center sending father home **and** 3 tell-tale signs CoVid-19: fever (might started way home Mom), muscle aches, cough!

It 'people partying' 'living lives' lead parent's deaths. Thank caring. Fwiw haven’t able find independent source brief attempt. language barrier makes difficult. find shortage complaints viruswaazin 

Assuming true, need always remember one study equate fact. Comprehensive local testing Italy yielded asymptomatic rate 40-45%. Presumably true means need data understand apply numbers populations. thanks! untaxed fellowship eyes govt make $0 lol Bidding wars? think that's dickish? Wait see medicine disbursed according state governors' declarations loyalty (and endless praise of) Trump's administration.   fifty percent people still recovering months later. That's said. He's like dr Fauci Netherlands. could ineffective enough... irony course deniers fully believe flu death number, based algorithm, already confirmed COVID deaths much less analytics suggesting even higher death count. Even though analytics use method use estimating yearly flu deaths. Hate tell San Quentin prison filling Bay Area hospitals fast. certainly way words, bet blast parties. 7t actually 378 + 600 = $978 per week. US government bought virtually entire production Covid-19 drug Remdesivir next three months.  US Department Health &amp; Human Services reached agreement drug's manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, purchase projected production month and 90% production August September.  make drug unavailable Europe rest world.  expected high demand one treatments shown alter course Covid-19.  intravenously administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times clinical trial, emergency use authorisation United States full approval Japan.  US patients commercial insurance, Gilead said charge $3,120 five-day treatment course.**

Easy money Pharma boys. 6/30 0 deaths, dashboard reports 114 new cases. Don’t know today yet...think gets posted 4pm. soon? would structured “everyone gets it”, there’s graduated tax certain point it’s moot.

Part reason millions people never got stimulus check capped $90k/year. means testing went along meant people needed money never got lost system, made last year got laid off.

Instead, give Americans money fix backend via taxes. Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend good job this. Here’s economists take inability think ones self spanned several generations. missed lead example boat long time ago 😂 Top post right Lt Governor Texas expressing sentiment. political that? need f'ing study this??? pretty educated Czech claim them. problem is, people feel issues(racism, body -obesity- , ...) downplayed. last couple years people(with scientific backing) tried correct that. Sadly nice people weaponized topic ... Students leave campus go jobs go home certainly learning real time well, study something 30 years, much better position understand additional context comes new data points versus random science denier. William osman’s “caretaker” shows bad her. careful one tho barely noticed might take wrong way already mass produced, waiting green light distribute need descriptive name maskless ones. suggest called ""Spreaders"" on. they're quoting accurately. wear go stores a/c usually on, haven’t really issue hot. averge person unemployment gets $378/week, even lasts max 6 months (some states even less time). 

The average person unemployment gets $9,228 year, find job year. Haha, sarcasm. see point view you, saying make sense. first link says 60-70%, 20%

You first person make mistake, 60-70% number they're saying threshold using traditional equation. whole point paper showing naive equation overestimates HIT. read actual paper, conclude 20% realistic. read anything past abstract? send 25 million Aus plz antibodies disappear that's okay. body cells remember create antibodies still fight future infections. There's plenty Americans taking seriously, we're obviously loudest group. makes feel better, going Europe anywhere else besides home foreseeable future. exactly opposite, synthetics better blocking droplets. Synthetics breathe, trap heat moisture. Great masks, comfy clothes. Cases trending sharply upwards almost counties -  dad 66 years old can't stop eating out

Hell yeah go 50 seconds

Some stuff article opinion based like said. '98% infections go without barely symptoms' directly rivm Omnivirus strikes again. I’m arguing that, said totally agreement shutting, seem ignored that. literally arguing something said agreed with... may still take 2021 even vaccine actually available public. clue.

Were always anti-intellectual society?

I know jack shit flying plane, let pilot trained life fly around instead building jet.

But somehow even complicated field medicine simple google MD enough... Emphasis science like Joe. know. They're waiting green light government. assume anytime soon. Haha one needs prove anything. read all, reported it.

Edit: continuity, deleted might lacking reading Corona infected nurses Sweden wiping ass. partially bidet. mostly patient healthcare sysrem. That’s fair, figured probably based comments, figured might well chip case.

Honestly, I’d say don’t give changing mind though. doesn’t sound like he’s completely unreasonable, it’s something worth pushing think.

Is someone well schedule? Maybe could give specific times schedules spending time together, things like cutting hair. going store, maybe could help set online delivery, curbside pickup. 

If he’s like dad, lot may mindset wanting things own- showing safer way may translate better.

You also spin situation yourself- you’re concerned getting sick, want around lot longer. Maybe help plan vacation next year, use sort leverage. siblings kids, try use help add little guilt.

You might tried too, might work, know things like sometimes help. I'm sure sarcastic response I'll take it, haha... probably right though, likely people. students know? Oxford vaccine safe works much covid started. would take absolutely worries. “summertime climate could adding problem, many opt indoor activities thanks triple-digit temperatures.”

This likely it. Georgia opened early, nothing happened longest time got hot.  Also remember *all* US ""disease infested."" Broad brush understand saying. I'm Trojan; feel trapped. So, getting smaller/separate plane would-be travelers or? work? article says 8% decrease roadway fatalities.

There 14% increase deaths per miles driven, 8% decrease roadway fatalities proportional 18.6% decrease miles driven. Honestly I’m struggling believe shit real... like ridiculous fuck man Yes, makes massive difference, different orders. mean anything says intended inform. Based exactly? gut? science don’t get hell wrong people, specifically ones refuse talk contact tracers. selfish possibly be? Fine hell them, hope $2K worth selfish piece garbage literally another flu coronavirus. guess going see wholes everything. 

I hope works really good. average person unemployment gets far, far less that. average person receives $378 week unemployment benefits, according U.S. Labor Department data year-end 2019. Well want see real herd immunity looks like suppose could look Brazil. They've 40% higher much time (I tried look week hard find information apparently).  anti-Fauci people say got mask policy wrong start. that's true. people working backwards conclusion (Fauci wrong 100%), 3% 10% wrong 100% wrong. someone 100% wrong, mathematically everyone else must better... depressing see shit happen irl. think may combination 

1. lag - deaths coming
2. know treat COVID-19 better 3 months ago (what works (remdesivir, dexamethasone) work (HCQ, antivirals))
3. hospital capacity overall preparedness (places like Italy NYC got absolutely blitzkrieged virus initially)
4. mischaracterization (people may dying COVID-19 called pneumonia deaths something) do. machine want extras. They'll give single use disposable ask, hand sanitizer available. commute home want go convenience store pack, like snack machine.

And keep mind, ""mask"" literally t-shirt tied around face. Double layer cotton fiber actually one better materials improvised mask. still virus mortality rate better ones polio pre-vaccine, measles pre-vaccine, etc.

Basically: new Black Plague like people trying make people, SARS part CoVid-19-SARS come this. economy 79% GDP. stimulus package designed get people spending. Sounds like it’s working intended.  don’t interface directly emr, rather source data models information gets written to, yes. get sued hosting party? grounds would consenting adult guests sue took risk attend party? Equilibrium != compromise, go ahead negotiate gravity. go 50 seconds. stuff opinion based article.

'98% infections go without symptoms mild ones' directly rivm Ha. Kindly RemindMe!2 weeks OP deathly wrong? better? least places capacity. Soon, may not. dying goes quickly. I’m well aware F. Stay safe, partner. UBI, would every citizen get it? would income level qualify anymore?  think understand directly means, written Jeroen Pols fellow interpretation questions. Directly would great. RIVM, hell indirectly do, NOS, nu, Telegraaf, please try dress anything really really poor effort world misinformation  Everyone saw coming dude, asking rhetorical question pretty much status quo. Non-Cowboys critically ill Cowboys good. apple day keeps doctor away...and corona virus pandemic day destroys apples business unknown future. Ohh please God one. agonizing. Put end ready please... telling makes feel better, good you. Every college administrator fighting reopen campus fall charged something. would really work way 97 percent survive. Disney World still planning opening 10 days. Go see comment responded called stupid. Keep comments, please thank you. Oh come on, that's ridiculous, talking Americans way.. .you mean shotguns!  hillbilly education system go through

Trump University - Class TBA live island 😊 Morons yes think issue one talks self righteousness Americans. consumed perceived freedoms everything power ensure anyone dares threaten take utmost action remove intrude upon actual freedoms fellow countryman. He’s risk. Part lung missing. cool guy. Wow, sorry think US actually zero people come background education.

Because obviously one born half century ago hop online read whatever.

It's lecture put position. Sorry understand.

I'm glad one taking approach though. article many many others getting information people levels education. India ordered lockdown nothing actually make work. entire lockdown effectively voluntary / punitive, rather planned state-supported. concept support millions migrant workers, causing  basically textbook example lockdown. necessarily players driving demand return sports leagues. teams ownership losing billions advertising sponsorship money right now. also assumed land size. think opening magically make things normal virus hanging around? mean, think. numbers seeing memorial weekend. see protests bring week next week believe. 

It's shit show. people still trying say ""It's okay let others die! economy important.""

Bob, listen economy tanked already, much now. sit back, call governor inform job protect US Citizens. 

I understood everyone freaked working, hospitals quickly running room. Soon going choose gets live. wrong fire employee. dutifully getting store policy. Imagine statistics would look disease like HIV/AIDS. diseases kill till years get them, they'll still kill you. Others, like anything damages poorly repairing organs like nerves/kidneys/liver take years life even look you. Others still, like Polio, leave disabled life.

People need realize human body magic, damage probably broken good ways. disease strong enough kill 1/20 people within month getting it, probably treating survive month well either. That's tricky part. try hardest follow every rule guideline, people around don't, can't really stop that.  Well, work store, area 30% people choose masks currently. Occasionally like bring think media blowing whole thing way proportion political reasons really big deal. attention fact almost states high end confirmed cases per population, either. Even though sparsely populated overall.

If combine 7 states group, better national average every statistic. Individually, two average cases/million, every state far better deaths/million average. Adding death rates interesting well

Meanwhile next door neighbors dinners twice week different families since week 2. people handle things completely differently it’s frustrating. Shit, I’m Washington state. thing work politely suggesting customers put mask. lot people wearing them. wish could say something customers it’ll get canned. Yeah that's fine, that's life. still people saying like flu cancelled King county seems like they're well control. Positivity still low. think King county case testing catching cases overall infection rate control. I'd feel really good living King county right now. 

Here Texas, cases rising along climbing positivity rate, increased hospitalization, increasing deaths. Increase case count definitely increased testing. ready reopen really mandate mask wearing asap. 

[Texas new new positivity Vaccine 2021. according HGTV shows, it’s pretty sunny AWLAYS light jacket weather year ‘round... doof RemindMe! 6 months ***Darwin enters chat.*** Tell fuck off, make sure someone films it, get rich Gofundme campaign like Starbucks barista. Correct!

You tell fuck once. cater bullshit come back .. exhausting. sure song (is bo burnham one?) key change modulation song’s key, basically “home base” chord, suddenly changes. common example “truck driver” key change, song’s key moves half step someone pressed gas pedal revved energy. Although key changes used different effects, lyric making fun key changes used music industry cheap way inject energy near end boring song. listeners eat music without questioning formulaic is. 

Someone musical probably explain better  I'm curious -41 deaths Massachusetts. legally governor counter sue money since governor suing 2nd world countries could little destabilization. Take away generics!

China Russia get bent :p one size fits solution working science fact medical studies past focused males subjects, carried findings Females. also racial/ethnic disparities health science well, Asians needing lower BMI at-risk diabetes. Flu death rate around 0.1%.

That’s around 20 times less COVID-19 death rate spit out.

I don’t know you, think sounds lot scarier flu.  Yeh beautiful place, I've British Colombia uncountable amount times since lived entire life last June moved Hawaii Seattle always short road trip, even Yukon twice. can't remember ever go Victoria kid, def Vancouver like 5 times. Probably would helped president call hoax first 2 months. love Arnold also got shit ton hospitals Boston. :-( Huh comment ends part use twist it. /S unconstitutional, several challenges process things progressing slower usual. 

If get ticket make argument judge forced defer judgment. mindset says responsibility leaders protect constituents.

Pelosi fail telling people ignore Covid visit Chinatown

Biden fail called Trump xenophobic banning Chinese residents coming US 

Deblasio Cuomo fail saying ignore Covid lat March, keeping subway running 24/7 till may forcing nursing homes take Covid patients.

Oh mayor Minneapolis governor blame police force.

D Mayor Atlanta, fault.

Nope R failing protect people  Yes, edit comment add sources.

Edit: also, correct: better protection better. simply make point everyone covering face holes pretty low effort effective, would obviate need extensive measures. “ Thinks “, specifically identifies lack scientific training. It’s knowing, knowing conducting research prove theory. Infected Fatality Rate I’m confused. Miami Herald reports hospitalizations nearly every day. Tampa Bay Times. 

Do mean total current hospitalizations? Cause get numbers new hospitalizations somewhere... morons country won’t allow they’re busy worrying strictly themselves. That’s issue self centered egotistical people choose wants vast majority people’s needs. purely due narcissistic behavior None anything topic stupid insensitive comments

Guy girl, stupid stupid Get tested. Ummm, refuse leave? r/conservative basically the_donald lite. someone worked restaurant industry seen goes behind scenes. trust going eat right now! A. economy collapsing end sight (the last part critical: 3 months lockdown clearly chance full containment)

B. protests. :) That’s entire point!

Government social contract – normal rules don’t apply social contract repeatedly violated bad/illegitimate governments.

Revolutions independence movements happen people tell shitty government fuck – taking back power along.

Someone navy going sit down, say anything, ask questions, move He's already stated planning sue Governor. drove location still open still packed. ‎ Yup. protests culmination kind thinking. look, maybe masks plus outdoors mean transmission low protests (and course worthy cause). still TERRIBLE behavior modeling (as media dropping COVID concerns going on). We're busy shaming irresponsible behavior conveniently forget went down.

""I've got mask OK"" translates someone else ""you've got thousand people crammed together screaming rally can't barbecue?"" they're kinda wrong.

It is, indeed, dangerous. rate could done whole thing 9 years. Nice little tool quickly compare trendlines.

p.s. Indonesia 4th largest country population.  American, wish US way. implore world follow poor example Ffs Seriously. posted stats answer canned ""You can't even math 7th grader understand CDC""

Coding bot could generate responses would trivial. American, cheeky bastard point. 3.5 - great, terrible. Early rumors Covid-19 could cause fertility issues. Anymore data that? acted appropriately. think we're ever gonna see eye eye I’m Florida, it’s bad advice get tested you’ve contact someone positive. CDC recommends close contacts know infect person get tested even asymptomatic. See can’t tell employer - Florida ‘employment will’ state? let go reason unless it’s due discrimination protected class. Give week get optimistic could due influx younger people infected. ever wonder we're baddies? Duh, chief. I've lived hear Victoria entire life. I've done lot travelling years seen ton beautiful places could live anywhere I'd still chose Victoria. Oh wanna like whole contrast thing rather blanket statements 

Take Quebec nursing home deaths out, recount little ""2X many per case"" gonna caveat things 

When misreport cases deaths, openly, data skewed. average death rate year year extra deaths - accounted Covid numbers - thats red flag RemindMe! 6 months I've stopped bars couple times literally walked circles people talk realizing I'm literally walking away them. Great news, keep numbers rising! Moarrr Hell notify police. point, I'm honestly weighing pros cons going catching end July, get quarantined least I'll pandemic unemployment assistance still employed health insurance. already lost health insurance original lockdown everybody got laid off, like pulling teeth get benefits retroactively applied.

And looks like time around, we're supposed fend ourselves. help seems coming level government. fill bath tub potable water hope best? best option supposed greatest country history world purposefully infect virus unknown future consequences, hope I'm group reacts severely it, hope takes place short window still PUA benefits legal protections.

Happy Fourth July, everybody. eliminated? laughed Yea. decided contact state AG morning, called store already voicr displeasure, left yelp. Wish job offer believe true. Death rates around world drastically improved due least reason 2 3. realize reasoning true across whole country south. mentioned though daily death percent remained steady states Florida Texas massively low percent. idahoan, confirm 98% state bunch redneck assholes believe Covid pretending exist. hospital Pocatello still refusing even test country contact confirmed case. refuse comment real data. #1 would need bleach UV light Chinese Hoax and/or liberal plot hurt Mr.Orange's wittle feelings.  Great, get negatives please? Sweden went test &amp; trace strategy start, would've superstar..

But genius epidemiologist [knows everything better /s       

His strategy far either nothing less others possible contradict everyone. scientists say ""Asymptomatic may spread virus"" says ""Asymptomatic probably spread virus, let's bother it"". scientists say ""We proven asymptomatic spread virus"" says ""asymptomatic main drivers spread let's bother it"".     
[And list goes    
It almost looks like agenda prove Sweden different, better every countries. Sweden fails, means countries understand actually won. all, would impossible, right? Wearing two masks: extra protection useless?
(In case two kn95s) knock wood. we're halfway point Fort worth first gun show past weekend: assumed would highly controlled nearly empty, grabbed mask went check out. 300 yard line outside get in, followed 45+ minutes people jammed large waiting room. looked waiting room looked gun show arena itself; zero mean zero social distancing going on. People stacked top spots. thousands people building. knows many infected. noped fuck Looks like curve flattened, open er up!! health experts repeatedly said 5 percent positivity rate lower recommended begin reopening, Florida seen almost week percentages double that.

Reopening continuing time soon, going take long time Florida 5% test positivity rate. Yup. Stockholm weekend many less people normal... even hot summer day. Even beach people generally kept pretty wide berth others. Yet deaths still haven’t gone much. I’m sure great fun figuring deadly disease works scientists work vaccine. exciting time science medicine. Yes death can’t least look silver lining expect scientists doctors/nurses keep going seems hopeless. Dude works virus could kill him, literally staring death face daily help figure stuff could help world, I’d trying make seem fun keep sane. not. Netherlands also need them. Sweden also need them.

It lot nuisance little risk decrease. Arizona control. closed 60 days. unnecessarily fucked up. lot people going die simple lack resources....😢 elon owns 10% Tesla stocks scerw investors bad deal without screwing first Lol right, like everyone suddenly going right thing. Mandate it, enforce fines, done already. read article? give free masks hand sanitizers stations  used way usage increased much? everyone walks door positive test getting jab? Thank you. it. I've also responded kind bullshit trolling (which CONSTANT) here: also account 5 month posting gap, often indicates account organic karma farmed used later: 

Again Germany Europe getting screwed.  think people quick say “well kid healthy” something like asthma may apparent definitely stories kids heart defects go unnoticed fall sports field :(

“Based doctors know far, appears kids obese health conditions including asthma higher risk severe illness disease, said. recent weeks, things opening up, cases gone up, especially older children” Yes, I’m really *really* concerned huge influx returning college students, thousands coming hardest-hit states (along parents helping settle 😱) ... don’t see won’t get inundated 😣 Rage Machine?

Ha! don’t think it’s doesn’t care kids. think it’s she’s beyond clueless entitled. :) Every think smell death raw meat even though there's way could around. vile. fair, I’ve heard countries US citizens anyway. We’re quite hated. [herd immunity says right there. COVID-19 R0 value 2-6, equating HIT value critical proportion population becomes immune, called *herd immunity threshold* (HIT) *herd immunity level* (HIL), disease may longer persist population, ceasing  critical value, threshold, given population, point disease reaches [endemic steady means infection level *neither growing declining* *exponentially*. 

50-83% population needs infected developed immunity, *or vaccinated*, herd immunity starts working stop exponential growth. [Johns School Public Health wrote article regarding **What take achieve herd immunity with SARS-CoV-2?**  infection, two ways achieve herd immunity: large proportion population either gets infected gets protective vaccine. Based early estimates virus’s infectiousness, likely need *at least* *70% population* immune herd protection.

You're interpreting herd immunity correctly. effectiveness much fact. main hope HI creation vaccine everyone protected without getting sick. alternative *everybody gets sick survives it,* according experts 70%. Thanks clarifying!!! One younger colleagues went outdoor wedding sister last weekend. Small, still dozen people....she posted pics FB...not single person young old wearing masks. wife runs school program state made virtually impossible require masks school. hope gets bad cancel school fall. terrible troll post fake news misinformation time. That's get downvoted. Happened town away end April. shut reopened week haven’t heard major outbreak since that’s possibility? country going way, right?

And outcomes different, right?

Decisions consequences, right? Yet states still reopening, companies still pushing employees return office, beaches still mass attended. 

The american experiment well truly failed. live here, even mandated masks like 2 days noone used them. assume British, appreciate this;

We nation founded people left England cause wanted ""mah freedums!"".

We fought guys could ""mah freedums!""

We wrote Constitution Bill Rights vaguely enumerated ""mah freedums!""

We spent past 200+ years meddling world affairs wanted spread ""mah freedums!""

Now wear mask prevent COVID cause ""mah freedums!"".

It's ignorance excessive hubris friend, that's is. ""It'll fine Easter drink enough bleach."" Yeah, definitely. one ever left car visit store public toilet, I'm sure... county Georgia, making parents pick in-person learning remote learning week, month school starts again. full details in-person learning environment, except masks encouraged required. First all, idea situation re: health concerns. fully aware could go find shitty job McDonald's Walmart put risk everyday people stay fuck home necessary go out, wear mask inside stores. 

I trying point fucked entire government response happening been. husband dedicated time building career last 12 years literally decimated total lack leadership accountability we're seeing federal level. 

Interesting though first instinct imply lazy ignorant. Says lot person. mean we're getting lot closer? sure state you’re in, may equivalent Hotels Healthcare Workers. California offers them. 

Quarantine due continual close contact exposure essential. wife obviously experiencing close contact exposure every day works. Making specific adjustments either covid also recommended. CDC provides information safety within households. 

Stay healthy take care. 

Note: I’m nurse educator. test positivity rate going day, means enough tests conducted. Very, worrying trend. us left. I’m still trying vigilant baby. 3 family members working healthcare. one us could bring shit home him.  Exactly happened last weekend Dewey Beach Delaware. Bars shut weekend Dewey, Rehoboth one beach it. unfortunately Fenwick, I'll be. means covid denier hoaxer, take much precaution can. sake well immune system, try get caught panic hysteria /r/coronavirus. wonder Fauci even aware almost everything says made headline ultimately incites panic amongst Redditors. (Stuff like may never vaccine, even find effective vaccine won’t effective) late. never late. start right thing right see results shortly. 1. Sweden decided become outlier.
2. news true? arguing censorship?
3. global pandemic. focus facts feels?
4. ""positive trends""? poor outcomes Sweden mean positive trends efficacy known public health interventions?
5. specifically sowing distrust, happening? Stonks go sentiment, COVID tracking projects. necessary separate data collection data presentation. Florida's data collection awesome, presentation Lol forgot switch accounts Yes please. think value fucking goat worth human being, well yes please. Tell me.
Or little life worth countries? talk getting staff run beds? Texas pool ICU nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists readily available additional 1000 beds? throw thousand ICU beds stadium staff, equipment, medication, supplies come care paralyzed proned COVID patients? 

If comfort state thousand additional ICU beds without real plan staff resource false sense security. beds useful bed home. Might well hop struggle breathe without enough staff supplies run them. No, protect vulnerable let young people basically run wild get it. Whether like idea not, that's plan is. technically 'do nothing.'  post translated articles frequently mistranslate them? extremely common, case aware, general discussion thread much suited it. place see people without them, pretty frustrating. Oh well fucked. gym open starting today (xSport), thinking starting workout again. work home, 10-7PM thinking going early like 7 mask potentially gloves, thing get out.

Do guys think worth it? feel like losing mind home time working like lot friends anything, feel alone lonely times anxiety lot. job bit stressful too, new it, learning home rough. thinking maybe working help gain muscle also put better mood. diagnosed antibody tested yet, I'm fairly certain caught hospital back February.

I keep pulse oximeter feel poorly often. seen spo2 97, frequently 92, making heart go berserk.

Months good aortic aneurysm, feel like even though ""fine"" month half could still kill me. add hand sanitizer dispenser machine lol, 75c single use hand sanitizer they'll need get mask amchine agree data Florida's dashboard include non-residents, change fact data state collecting high quality. Like said, COVID tracking project grades I’m lockdown till vaccine available. makes sense, Though would seriously reduce income. due hospitals prepared, ppe shortage, vent shortage also lack drugs increase mortality (we treatments now).

Don't forget could also younger people (proportionally) get tested positively compared months ago. known. Pay 2400 week I'll take offer. Americans hoarding masks. tendency, country, selfish hoard. lie mean make sense...nor earse decades experience training. I'm doubtful live sound engineers find gigs time like this. think also...it’s cliche point blame “the media,” think normalizing opinions news plays big part cycle extremism. you’re seeing people editorialize *constantly*, it’s harder harder shift news, opinion, logical conclusions slippery slope fallacies straight misinformation. 

And “news” media reporting social media presences posts, social media reacting media responding social media, get basic nightmare. Indiana isn’t bad moment. Still seeing steady amount cases one wears masks town since cases here. Actually wear mine feel eyes judgment makes really self conscious... one seems care regulations see weeks No! Hahaha...pro-life he? learned older sisters do. US basically become rest world. mean that's truth, 40 mortality rate 0.2%. 40-50 0.4%. Possibly lower depending prevalent symptomless cases turn be. states surging new cases right lag deaths 2-3 weeks due virus naturally progresses. July going August going rough states, measures taken start reflect data around start August. What’s issue here. signed document clearly stating May 31.


“If employee want come work concern might expose at-risk member household, HR provide employee document **employee sign submit confirm situation receive Unpaid Leave May 31**”

Lots people don’t want go work can’t work home. That’s point.  guess redditors don’t like idea based votes. It’s young people. Selfish people solely concerned themselves, give consideration impact others. ""expert"" spews shit fired brought charges. Kids spread common cold like wildfire magically thing that's even contagious? Yeah sure.  Completely disagree. nothing irrelevant comment, comment relevant comment responds without relevant earlier comments. limits topic discussion creeps to—no rules. 

I don’t see r/atheist member all. tongue cheek reminder whatever probabilities assigning Adam’s children explicitly stated can’t verified—though get original comment joke too. isn’t say don’t pointing basic fact out. still frame reference show ridiculousness 2000 years old even Jewish fundamentalists think ridiculous timeframe. Edit: also acknowledged metaphorical aspect time, creationists not. Yeah main objective raising stock price Lmfao, whole post political really messed part scientists told us masks wouldn’t help. almost two months. 

Then told us lied.

Perhaps scientists stop playing politicians too? That's also possibility. Getting point realize something someone believed wrong, that's growth.

Having realize wrong, admit that, change ways maturing actually is.

Don't hard yourself, wrong.

Some us ever admit like Rogan Trump, full grown child thier entire lives. Never strength courage face themselves. need spell you? Remdesivir IV-administered drug. 

Americans get they're hospital can't breathe. 

That is, assuming American hospitals actually get hands drug. federal government absolutely terrible record resource allocation pandemic. Please tell forgot ""/s"" course, many people. Everyone knows that. get rid stupid ones first right? Oh, makes sense. Like said another post, it’s partially understandable people don’t invest lot understanding position, pretty significant part position misunderstand. It’s also plain critical thinking mistake something know about, regarding year 2020 means.  going need em think US government would find way minimize it. Let's face us Americans going loose many people election going another lock start saving lives Trump going it. Preparing flying sperm 2 months. 2020 MF!! NC made “mandatory” really means it’s business owners enforce it.. sadly everyone wants money natural selection coming early NC everyone, thanks Cooper called disaster triage. really hope need important plan. hospitals running state, bet would prefer prevention efforts made. bad, Detroit.

Actually... whole ""hell earth"" thing makes sense now.

I assume since correct anything else, rest right? world laughing before, we’re seriously worried. hope like Tulsa rally enough people go nope give miss.  local government must pinning lot hope tax expect get this. 

Its thing come with. must say, swine flu harder transmit covid19 (that's saying much thought covid19 hella contagious). confident HK surroundings squash swine flu outbreak.

 yeah, fkn fast. morning, still walking around, living life per normal, knowing last day. Evolution. I'm sure got voted, mass protests obviously spread virus some. One mom's friend passed away recently Covid. 74 nurse. test rate consistent increase? remained same? Thank response, way. Colleges aware this. simple strategy:

1) Act like going fully open sucker 18 year olds sweet subsidized loan money talk precautions.

2) Run classes weeks, go passed tuition refund deadline.

3) Close campus matter ""public safety"", shuttle everyone poorly organized makeshift online classes.

4) Congrats, good guy saving lives tricked tens thousands people pay tens thousands dollars online degree covered majority semester's costs.

This exactly they're know it. want stop elective surgeries. Texas Florida reported 4,000 pneumonia deaths year. average (which consistent year year states) 900 state. try shut stuff point people won’t follow orders. Canadian, I’ve never human rights tribunal argument.

I mean it’s true usually say sorry but.... 14 icu beds available 300+k population trama service area today. Never mind reading constitution. Let somebody else tell says!

/s worst fan fiction I’ve ever read Probably not. "" Parts State (Employees Only) ""

That one poorly conceived policies. basically admits customers important employees expendable IMO.  No, somewhere 15.00 - 20.00 range makes sense. know situation Texas job would pay 515.00 week adding Federal 600.00/wk. Maryland broke worked server. weekly unemployment taxes 144.00/wk Federal aid I'm making would pre-covid. going assumtion particular field basically dead forseeable future (then robots). Ask happy Floridians unemployment. Federal minium currently 10.80/hr equates pretax income roughly 22,500.00/annual IRS/FICA/state county taxes. deduct basics rent/power/phone/food/health care/transportation (I'm assuming live alone purposes example). see I'm shocked happy care stock market rebounding nicely. examples people making like bandit pandemic us. forget forgiving rent/morgages overdue yet. Schools, sports, packed stadiums happen. FREEDOM FESTIVAL



This two words define dumbfuckingstan situation. GL.  many mental gymnastics need sidestep objectively factual  I'm sure understand herd immunity works. works vast majority population got sick antibodies preventing disease infiltrating population without antibodies. Herd immunity relevant *after* everyone's already gotten sick.  fear going many stories like worse. make appreciate flaws I'm glad universal healthcare.

The testing UK done showing symptoms &amp; isolating 

Am fortunate position every week next 3 weeks, every month year tested part coronavirus survey. done home, every member household  dead people, guess numbers real either? Yes. need this. There’s way get everyone’s house keep parties think messaging could lot stronger bad idea. Especially weekend. **Coronavirus likes this.** literally can’t go day without thinking upcoming election, I’ve probably said SO/friends “Can November please come quicker” dozens times. I’m eager lose. It’s nerve racking. even 1 person 6 take precautions, virus can't stopped. Look scientist Thunderf00t YouTube detailed explanation. Never judge man face, maybe sexy dick. I'm fine bunker family everyone attitude ""corona parties"". totally interest let happen emerge soon afterwards over. long plenty expendable workers, we're cool.

However, that's really right thing do.  lot lives saved people wear masks, social distance, give non-essential things. I'd rather go route. Tampa 11K (floridacovidaction.com). live abut hour (45 minutes nice low traffic day) - knew shit would go ham people want (and still don't) listen. I've least seen masks grocery stores though. Good know perfect mask usage effective. guess, standard, nobody wearing mask going perfect every single time. 

Oh, wait, something still better nothing. Yeah try living red desert. fact currently

Key word: currently. 

They said kill hopes leaving country *one day*, today. [9] But... muh freedums! Lol learn read graph. I'm glad came across reddit comment history.

At time article, death toll reached ~5000 Italy.

The death toll now, little 3 months later, going top around 35,000 barring second wave Italy.

I want respond think witty sarcastic remark demean make feel better, want close eyes really try imagine many 35,000 people really is. Innocent people nothing wrong, instead endure painful grueling death time lungs swell much can't even take breath.

Now want think, 3 months ago, imagine 500,000 innocent people going die way around world (probably way ever got real numbers China)?

How sensationalism 3 months ago turn opinion?

Also last point concern one comparing otrocities WW2, instead explaining devastation global pandemic would one worst otroicities globally since WW2.

Again reply must, rather wouldn't, enjoyed reflecting back post. FrEe CoUnTrY there's harm going home means do! make sure putting household members risk. Never hospitalized. described mild case home (2 1/2 weeks symptoms, nothing super serious). Still dealing anxiety, mid depression, fatigue, diminished lung capacity, etc. They've reporting pneumonia Fuck people think 1 mill Jan, 225 assuming thing still going strong. wish could build tall impenetrable wall around state keep everyone keep everyone state safe. virus spreads like wild fire states know matter time travellers state come spread virus CT lot big white collar companies this. Jan 2021 earliest even saying stay home permanently want. fucking man?? go concert first MAGA MAACTA: Make America Cautionary Tale would judgement call got assuming assigned seats. like normal times would probably choose least sketchy person sit next to. anyone coughing wearing mask properly would sit front them. time started using stupid country example become like.  True, I'm black lesbian - certainly something genre would typically - love country. Like anything else shitty toxic fans. Georgia? reporting anything (not I've seen publicized anyway) northern cali cold bro, fuck rather live west palm, nice me. lived LA Miami, 
California fires man I'm done place, 2 years row went fall/winter holy cant even breathe outside days. Florida fine like Miami rather somewhere quiter richer, Im away people vibe chill out. Yep, drove around San Francisco, pleasantly surprised many wearing masks.

We went small park 3 older guys playing catch. masks covering mouth nose, saw us cutting across field, put on.

Not perfect joggers masks, tricky, I'll give pass. 80% reporting deaths immediate. can't stop laughing. used 7 days math average 20% 🤣🙆‍♀️


I'm dumb one sis  Exactly sort things outside condoms protecting COVID-19?

Or maybe want know. said anything big part people assuming it? pointed why. Nothing more. yes, splitting demographic. equal parts though. split 90/10 10% louder part still split. never said majority people. you‘re able undestand reading fault tbh. goes article. sensationalized, (not you‘re) perception problem. 

Tl;dr: explaining WHY, MANY Possible sequelae. Diabetes mellitus. Strokes. Long term illness, loss function, disability. course, everyone's favorite, poverty / bankruptcy I'm prude I’m gonna surprised even hit 50k+ cases day soon. actually surprised goes anytime October. PMing Eh knows things well. It’s strays wheelhouse things get dicey, he’s acknowledged before. Really show watched guests. facilitated things.  smart people giving us medical advice say caused absolutely uptick covid cases.

That said, least understand masks necessary. least got going me. US case study handle pandemic also stupid people be.

Shit fucking infuriating bright side going eventually result new leadership end year since current administration refuses take virus seriously. IMO Jack Dorsey could done lot good sorting sock puppet misinformation accounts platform donating 20% net wealth. That's really splitting hairs. personally trust Fauci beginning. However, others, made statements early believe intended dissuade people purchasing/hoarding masks. statements come back bite asses people using past statements (however incorrectly context) reasoning wear masks.

I get it, tough epidemiologist. ton knowledge begin understand virus do, apply chaotic public who's stupidity knows bounds. think hard lesson learn terms preliminary guidance gave impact long term. ""Knock knock!"", ""Who's there?"", ""The second wave!""

I’m even going comment ‘dead month’ claim don’t think insulting either intelligences early morning necessary. aren’t enough cops planet enforce 
Mandates everything guys want mandated. Also Indiana - agree. Big worry right many people know / hear talking going Florida right now. I'm concerned going there, getting it, bringing back (and spreading it, okay going Florida right now, isolation/mask wearing probably agenda).

So couple weeks go come back, couple weeks quietly spread since like say, people wearing masks, potential ignite here. can, give minute. It’s shocking haven’t seen reddit spend day here. Btw I'm malay, Brit Germany, used live KL dad still there. They've done really good job I'm proud country achieved, especially given recent political developments could disastrous.

Shouldn’t try prevent deaths rather ignore dangers? Yeah, Norwegians probably mildest offenders. Danish Finnish visitors many enough make news though. Yes. Three layers heavy weight cotton. state 10% June. Hell hit 19% yesterday. tend hire staticians distort data support government theory. problem facts swamp official evidence. u also gonna stop using Amazon buying Apple products fact vectors testing show get it. 50 tests larger view talking spitting sea. Reopening isn’t continuing time soon...

Florida: Hold beers  

I hope you’re right, meeting healthcare experts’ recommendations never slowed reopening before. uhhh.... thousand dollars?

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) entry receptor novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, aetiological agent COVID-19. time, ACE 2 expression decreases COVID-19. Two seemingly contradictory relationships expression ACE 2 COVID-19 reported. Increased level expression ACE 2 may risk factor development COVID-19 infection, reduced ACE 2 expression COVID-19 leads acute respiratory distress syndrome. article provides comprehensive overview available scientific knowledge role ACE 2 pathogenesis COVID-19, available current day. Also, discusses unknown factors reveal order understand whole role ACE 2 pathogenesis COVID-19. Would stupid go?

yes Haha. think downvoting means anything subreddit. simply hivemind mob mentality. cannot understand comparing nation like China Vietnam, complete autocratic rule every aspect citizen's lives, idiotic compare Democratic nation, need go read history books simple paragraph explanation help you. Yea, trip planned go see Battlebots taped LA start April (from east coast), super excited it, planned ton really fun looking things around trip.

Then started hearing virus February. Figured, ""meh, it'll probably like ones turned nothing."" Picked really heavy duty masks figured we'd wear airport flight stay safe (because figured want get sick cold whatever would hurt enjoyment trip).

By early March, saw bad things starting get various things planned getting cancelled us, cancel trip.

Since then, masks, symbol of, ""we're going exciting vacaion safe it"" symbol of, ""we're effectively trapped can't anything.""  week next, hospitalizations, 2 weeks today, death death death. seems defy biology children able spread spread it. 

In state protest set state said go back school kids would wear masks I'm sure claim going one reasons use justify position. least personal experience, definitely older people dont care/dont think it. convince family hang one houses vs going trip somewhere. fun 4th peace instead 1000x people beach certain tourist destinations nearby fucking real. work guy test positive closed HALF DAY one told whether might've contact person.

I said fuck told wasnt coming back got tested. complained entire time out. motherfuckers close week ask everyone get tested coming back. 

These companies fucking greedy. numbers nowadays. 

Don't remind House Senate. gotta busting asses trying figure shit out, gotta make sure people gonna get shit storm unharmed? don’t think country’s economy well right now. sorry employees situations put this. forgotten part pandemic. Everyone cheers masks rules laws, one stops think someone needs enforce compliance police. Instead, people like trapped situation forced take abuse risk employees safety. wish simple answer, unfortunately think is. bad people there. sister days hospital there's plenty room patients, problem they're understaffed due many nurses quitting recently.  Calling people ""plague rats"" never agenda. country intent destroying rather proven wrong.

I'm already planning bail, fuck America. future here. That's great think state opened shuttered hospital, provide another 339 beds. round enough doctors nurses start putting beds unused sports facilities. can't believe downvoted this. Wow. think Hank 3 ever play live again.  simple. Whatever Rush Limpballs tells fit narrative.

It's odd since besides actually reasonable guy good work with. work, let anyone who's using collar tee shirt face covering many people walking door. second back turned, let fall off. almost impossible get properly fitting tee shirt stay face seconds. I'm you, totally count face covering. Optimisim...Yeah. show virus who's boss... need servers patrons staying served. Pickup effectively eliminates position, preferable scenario overall safety, particular component flatlines, likely would exclusively manager kitchen staff maaaybe one two extra hands deck. then, everyone China stood clapped. Forgive Frequently Asked Question,

if is, please type answer me.

If COVID-19, significant also COVID-19, continuously giving back forth back forth forever, never giving bodies time needed fight virus good? remember getting New York Times news alert saying 1000 reached US feeling shocked. see 47,000 day blink. No. state governors controlled curve best could federal response. hospitals arent experiencing high volume. Honestly though I’m saying masks protect people encourage mask wearing. Focusing wearing prevent spreading others clearly isn’t working, narrative changed masks protecting mask wearers well, bet people would get board.

It’s completely false either- degree protection, even small 0! hospitalized pneumonia! literally thanking complaining comment... type Reptilian statues. lot countries. around since beginning time. That’s fucked got Corona lol what?

please explain me, know exactly ""bullshit"" part post. 

Do think average Chinese person sits takes orders sitting down? human beings like rebellious side us. took YEARS smoking actually stop happening indoors, even though illegal YEARS.

This time, police enforcement quarantine laws super super fast. 

What want? video lady's neck broken? family biohazard mask?

If provide them, actually apologize? There's loon conspiracy reddit still saying covid bs...

The one failure way US govt set idiot enough crazy following put charge things. We've got many conspiracy theorists insane. worked food sevice put college. 

I say, utmost confidence people mindset buying food give fucks anyone else long get want. People become reliant convenience lash horribly dare disrupt that. become lazy entitled stand told cannot something always done.

People scum, pandemic putting fact full display. US, got full box blood tests(25pz) 500USD, kept friends family safe, doubt get tested. Funny part US made. blows mind government hospitals turn back own. kind animal-based news channel, I'm sure. I've takeout twice week help favorite local restaurants take night cooking. Definitely returning sit dining quite time, even though opened 50% capacity. I've seen people Reddit (and elsewhere) say hospital near laying staff completely untrue hospitals overflowing.

Hey, dummies: completely true hospitals one city near empty hospitals city two hours away overflowing. Source? Trump, takes extreme moreso other. Every time President gives speech he's always going ""we're leader free world, ya'll enjoy freedoms have, we're privileged best freedom, that's gave freedom Iraq Syria""

Very mentions respectable go mld inconveniences people country prevented actual suffering. always individualistic greedy.

Don't believe me? last President talked asking individuals country instead way around disliked shot. bad take.

The 3-4 top countries fucked makes 400 cases day look like nothing, time 400 day would headline news. Actually complete bullshit. still know long immunity lasts. According studies, antibody levels start decrease within two three months, especially asymptomatic people. could potentially leave vulnerable reinfection.

Wow thank clarification. That's aspect considered, truly regret hadn't. Thank you. lot Indian people really choice. family says. much different culture, parents lot power kids. Even kids grown ass men/women.
Thats arranged marriages still thing. speaking govts outside United States what? right basically sums up.

America, FUCK wrong far. live here, born raised... asking damn question. Going college taught education make people smart One patient Banner hospital Phoenix, Jessica O'Neil, told ABC News taken precautions like wearing mask avoid contracting COVID-19. 30-year-old single mom multiple preexisting conditions, believes single trip gym led infection.

Yeah, good work there, Ducey, opening Gyms ""essential"" services. Also, lady made could grave mistake. understand line thinking: multiple preexisting conditions, totally cool go place people respirating air accelerated rate. early right? China's role Covid-19 epidemic:

Had response China swift elsewhere, initial testing faulty requiring do-over, masks partisan issue central government favoring individual freedom forced isolation apartments doors nailed shut, difference would half million Chinese would died alongside hundred thousands Europeans hundred thousands Americans. me, got sick March 12th, still better. fit healthy too, virus joke. Yep, DFW area I've heard fireworks going day. I'm surprised, disappointed. Well worded! keep reading everywhere California bought time that. Bay Area? yea guy said also want make clear using GNC sort generic term. Players supposed take anything like come athletic facilities minimum tested.

So let's say buddy, owns local gym, selling stuff gets super pumped whatever, usually junk tons sugar caffeine, includes banned substance, unlikely may be, could happen. no, mean whole part asians looking eyes...

it's definitely less americans, always??

I commenting comment "" insinuating east asian people look eye? nonsense""

Yes, ""nonsense"", completely untrue.

Eye contact strangers minimized little bit back home (at least me, canada)

For example, someone working department store asks help something, ""need"" look eye say ""no alright"" 

&amp;#x200B;

You say it. Lots people feel uncomfortable making eye contact situation develop personal bond feel burden ""부담"" buying stuff there. 

Also, restaurant, server come put stuff table without making eye contact say thank without making eye contact. always try make eye contact even though notice it, everyone makes effort, I'd say around half end making eye contact. 

I say though, professional server are, eye contact end making. However, average college part-timer really care much customer service seem prefer invisible possible. company dinners 10+ koreans, thing. Usually youngest employee actually talking server make eye contact everyone else kind acts like nothing else going on. think that's normal, seems rather disrespectful me.

I honestly feel less eye contact. I'm Chinese-Canadian living Seoul last 12 years want context. know much asian countries rarely visit do, foreign friendly locations everyone acts american. Phase 4: Profit still massive influx people drive-in venue. Public toilets venue, nearby fast food restaurants gas stations influx out-of-towners, etc least use valid example expand claims. yeah home someone home let someone home 😂😭honestly man, evaluate opinion bit harder. Funny article support headline multiple studies say spikes infections cities big protests.

No really, smug asshats always fucking smug always can't bothered read fucking article.

She got sick DAY ATTENDING. get sick protest, already fucking sick.

This article cities multiples studies multiple cities. Guess what, outside lowrisk. Guess what, socially conscious protestors **wore fucking masks masks cut spread**.

But sorry, busy jerking narrative, failed actually thinking literally fell clickbait headline.

Fuck you, people like what's wrong EVERYTHING right think California, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada southern states. Frankly, need people like Arnold. Especially famous people, use fame misinform people straight know they're talking need learn him. first person come across self awareness. susceptible heightened thinking, conspiracy theories real number person. majority people believe stuff, believe stuff. everything big Texas, including Coronavirus cases...Yeeehaawww! They’re theories. aren’t supported anything. article inaccessible don’t comment nonsense data. 

The fact “stand behind” nonsense enough stop conversation altogether. Here’s working paper real fireworks year.so.everynight people.are.setting fireworks. Probably cldbrating AZ beats TX covid statistic. Yup. Currently missed persons post. $600 week allows lot unemployed sit home relax. see lot neighborhood. always garages hanging out. $600 really nice them.

Gotta let $600 week end. locked doors start March due start May recovering bronchitis, pneumonia, flu. baby here, leave take newborn appointments. four year old left house except ride car doctor pregnant drive myself. people complaining able go kids, shocks me. like personal desire important people around living. selfish. added ranks show 1-50, I'm sure point using state totals/averages use country medians. comparing two groups.

Also even population density particularly valuable states. example: Nevada's population density ranked 42nd, state lives two metros. stat like urbanization concentration index might effective.

Either way, lot variables think conclusions draw. general, think reason states ""got away"" lock-down lower density. interesting deaths / million rates following pattern. Uh...thanks Stefon. Well? What'd expect greatest country Earth?

American birth, TEXAN grace God!

/s  Ah February, back sub busy trying deduce higher Chinese death number notice CDC reporting zero single digit daily tests

I remember talking someone right Superbowl, guy going China acted one week earlier, told China know virus, now, instead 20/20 hindsight maybe 20/20 now-sight would better. response, there's need, US cases.

That aged like milk. party even bigger chutiya. trump? Dang, everyone make shit political. cunt typical Karen, Paris stood her. It’s bullshit fired, good riddance wouldn’t want work company canned either answer question painfully obvious lol. Aw crap bad looked map.  would Metroplexs area trade patients. bad. Checking find area. 

It looks like planned whole state. like may medicine good luck stay safe. aren’t contagious. Sorry loss. (80% x 330e6 - 25e7)) /40e3 = 5975 days current rate 16 years Deaths still going down. testing lot you’re going positives. median age positives 30s. Contradictory reports Texas hospitals getting full reports says aren’t. 

The protests Los Angeles likely super spreader events. Lots people drove carpooled protests, maybe 3/4 wore masks. drove carpools home interacting close spaces. grocery store example. catch everywhere, even home.  ""Out respect you, want drive way Leavenworth""

So much respect. I'm beginning sense pattern country:

Out respect healthcare workers, we're going military jet fly-bys instead spending money PPE.

Out respect blacks, we're going rename street color logo black remove one TV show episode instead actually introducing changes system. theyhave empathy national strategy.....does US even know is? Lol Indeed. real choice voted either candidate last go around. simply vote anyone big two waste Forgive Frequently Asked Question, 

if is, please type answer me. 

If COVID-19, significant also COVID-19, continuously giving back forth back forth forever, never giving bodies time needed fight virus good? ... happened make Mexico build wall? went school dude floods Facebook news feed entire world faking virus, sensationalizing sole reason make sure Trump get relected. I'm lying. delusional. really high? antivaxxer flat earther

Neither those. fact, I'm trying sign vaccine trials. inside outside. say wear masks....bullshit, much drinking going on. way masks stay on. Italy, Spain, UK massive lockdowns. decreasing cases government eventually intervened. Texas lockdown told ignore Dr. Fauci experts 20 deaths city alone day  Damn sucks. TSP bomb. love sounds dangerous drivers actually. used work trust safety ride share company man, things escalate real quick. Im europe waiting bullshit goddamn vacation west side us, damn miss cali upnorth  Yes I'm pretty sure list announcement hence guess they're new additions. Different person replied. use convert straight text?  wring hands fall crying stupid ones go anyway? Nope. Deserve get. opposite far worse sub - neutral slightly negative news blown proportion doomsday lol. necessarily. We're testing lot percentage positive tests much lower March/April. Also younger cohort getting infected now, treatments improved. think there's reason optimistic deaths going shoot back up. 

The increase cases happening 3-4 weeks now, deaths continued decline. Hopefully trend persists. jfc, that's irresponsible dangerous Anyone US experiencing anxiety COVID right simply paying attention. know. :( know however put finger one nightmares medical community.  HIV could transported misquotes. don’t to, I’m going Costco grocery store across street, keep mask drive. minimizes touching mask. Also sometimes I’ve forgotten it’s on. Yes, speaking broad generalizations, always outliers. safely assume future conversations, avoid lot unnecessary arguments. Go read sub people dealing right now. R/covid19positive (I think) ill forget im wearing sometimes lol blame politicians alone.

I February, screaming activate Defense Production Act, immediately, mask everyone, immediately.

I mocked, laughed at, told alarmist, told would hard... lame excuses avoid hard, inevitable changes.

It's politicians fault.

It's also fault lot people reading comment right now.

It obvious early February needed done. inconvenient, done.

And are. seeing U.K. principally deaths associated high infection rates quite ago. long tail deaths cases come patients may take considerably month die hospital course add roughly two weeks infection hospitalisation.

Unfortunately AZ see carnage deaths start August. 

And although treatment improved recent months, AZ surely hospitals overwhelmed soon bets rates change then.

Good luck everyone AZ. Stay safe can. it’s worth, braved dentist 2 weeks ago fine. call ask preventative measures anything need know absolutely go. dentist PPE’d head toe double masks face shields got first thing morning.

Having said that, getting wisdom teeth wait calms tyvm. It’s critical. driver want keep gig going. buy clear sheet &amp; rope tie ceiling car armrest like $50 Menards. 1/2 hr project that. 

Having barrier give big advantage Uber/Lyft drivers rides would think, shows care safety stopping virus. take didn’t watch congressional panel yesterday hear multiple people say 70-85% think realize virus you. Sure, might survive one lucky ones, lot people get never same. virus lot permanent damage body. also develop chronic fatigue syndrome might never go away. Hope gets attention. Look data. really give shit reddit makes think shit add posts. Clearly not. Go hang antivaxxer flat earther friends, plague rat. Soooo basically go outside impunity?

This reasonable takeaway question evidence stems question.

You're engaging reasonableness. were, question would be, ""How enjoy outside safely?""

Instead question was, ""So take precautions say need prove me."" I'm paraphrasing, naturally, reasonable mindset.

You want become rules lawyer virus I'm telling dumb. Oh hell I'm going! sad truly one funnest get togethers year. I'm particular anything might hurt family. boat you. Symptoms since March, finally officially tested today VA. expire 5pm every day. exhaustion fog real. hope recover soon. going issues vaccine available. people think one magically appear everywhere one day we’ll go back normal next?

The setups testing, distribution, administration, management; need exact things successfully deploy vaccine. whole month june 45 cases 1 death.

A month ago 13 hospitalized 4 ICU 106 quarantined. 
Now 3 hospitalized 1 ICU 80 quarantined.

To give reference around peak 291 hospitalized 60 ICU 858 quarantined.

They 0 3 cases day. constant long time. Even population small (520k) seems lot safer many places europe. 

Scaled germany population would average 240 cases day scaled italy 180.

The math 45 monthly cases half million like 7200 cases country 80 millions (45 x 160). Since monthly cases june 30 days 7200÷30 240.

By numbers seems safe germany outbreak meat factory, germany got (lower since peak) 7 day rolling average approx 250 daily cases around mid june. Assuming talking surgical mask, someone experiment seem work well prevent droplets expelled forward (at people things), thoughthe loose/poor fit might mean droplets escaping air around face. Simpler times. believe science still take risks. likely much better understanding risks someone doesn’t understand science. Bunch virus hoaxers. Watch Dr. ImNotActuallyaDrorinTX videos YT FB, totally debunks everything. 16 year old moldavan kid clearly knows ""experts"" ""PhDs"" ""MDs"". rate could reach herd immunity election time. Mission Accomplished /s I'm stealing this, love Estimates vary pretty widely. studies reporting alarmingly high numbers: early April, one lab Iceland reported many 50 percent cases could asymptomatic; month, India’s top medical research body reported 100 infected people studied, 80 symptoms. one Boston homeless shelter, 400 guests staying, 146 tested positive COVID-19 April, reported reason choose 80% upper end spectrum. less people asymptomatic, total number carriers calculation would less time towards herd immunity would increase. point show herd immunity would take really long while, wanted make sure making easy assumptions hence choose stat would achieve herd immunity fastest.  folks wearing masks close quarters

That's reasonable people can't funeral. modeling still showing better outcome places.

They didn’t correctly, that’s sure, youyang gu model topping 50 deaths per day late August. slowing hit 8% immunity. 

That’s almost exactly Italy, Spain, UK right infection rate slows it’s own. charts, sick patients. We’re letting people go home we'd never let go home sick,” including patients low oxygen, DelVecchio said. “We're trying get home oxygen. We’re trying tell come back worse. there's much you."" Good archive.is. Outline nicer though.

Edit: see archive exactly used above. feature, bug. chances USA wide access Oxford vaccine, though, given competitors developed corporations, plus multiple instances hoarding medicines (which think would put Oxford supplying USA vs countries, especially Europe developing world, first)?

Pretty sure government make sure ""made USA"" vaccine available here, UK university vaccine.

I would prefer Oxford one point. Heck, I'll pretend Brazilian. somebody teach Portuguese right quick? shave bikini line? many test subjects generated neutralizing antibody last test? remember zero? One mentality I've noticed around area think seriously flawed common belief virus already ""went us"" winter. live rural Washington St. we've lucky far keep cases low 0 related deaths. fair share people shunning protocol ""freedums"" equally concerning people hear saying already bad. Many friends think covid sick January, yesterday dentist told worry already bad. Absolutely none people tested think assuming Covid when, likely, flu another seasonal virus. IMO spreading myth dangerous give people false sense security think extremely unlikely random locals really Covid. wrong assuming this? want approach rationally would appreciate feedback. time different, huh? things magically changed?

feels like feb/march again, assertions can't happen here, happen, without good reason why. denial hell thing. US worst infected country, would make sense need Yes- read University Chicago newsletter reviewing study one researchers done. chiffon silk fabrics electrostatic charge virus gets cotton chance still neutralized. Plus find comfortable multi-layered cotton masks. newsom sucks worse desantis. False. I'm saying scientists mess initial guidance. I'm saying people dismissing scientists made one mistake, hurting us more. hah. like government cares...they’re interested corporate immunity letting people whole bootstraps dog &amp; pony show. [NY]   
  party, many partygoers refused talk contact tracers, according Rockland County executive’s office.   
   partygoers parents answer calls contact tracers, officials said. However, parents also refusing allow children talk contact tracers, denying child attended party.   
  Rockland County Health Department begin issuing subpoenas compel partygoers talk contact tracers. comply face fines $2,000 day, according officials. Damn lesbians going happy that. Yeah, sort tiptoed around Fauci. they're directly attacking him, believe they're gearing blame crisis, claiming faulty advice  know it’s bad keep seeing Texas articles non-Texas specific subs. went Bikini bottom, we’d residents screaming Krabby Patty servers making minimum wage, saying oxygen tanks oppressive. actually believe scientists something win lying politicians? That's naive. believe Trump ever private conversation Fauci told talk, say certain things? politics. Scientists job, politicians politics. so, dumb. Herd immunity 70-85% FYI.

No not. Best estimates put somewhere 

And goal reach see benefits. Every % population infected provides much protection reducing R, effective reproduction number. Masks also reduce R. social distancing work home. things work together hopefully reduce R 1 number cases start dropping. would nice get actual data people getting infected. hard ask: wear mask time, sometimes, never. told protests. link goes ""Sorry, can’t seem find page you’re looking for"" wayback machine seem archived. removed link works, sounds interesting?

Also anyone else reading issue companies making profit, free market charms many ways risk/reward scenarios corporate perspective high risk / high reward, known risks always win unknown rewards, angel investment exists - wealthy investor (including national government) spreading funds portfolio high risk potentially high reward investments benefit shareholders.

In free market terms taxpayers forced shareholders government, government investments appropriate returns investments, shareholders can't decide invest (you can't pay taxes) like entity need wise force government seek return investment; power individuals vote government held account return investment.

What saying wary large corporations asking billion dollars handouts taxpayers already invested R&amp;D, speculative upscaling manufacturing may need occur - grants given directly tied measured control pandemic - order prevent companies developing ""treatments"" cures (so sell doses), grubbing tax dollars ""projections"" never eventuate.  wearing mask well advised confused CDC.  would think obvious conspiracy fixing numbers would concern anti-government folks.  People inclined based gastrointestinal advice top government figure. caveats: studies based small sample sizes neither yet vetted peer review.

So studies currently worthless. Thanks. downed 24 oz Four Loko even close buzzed enough incredibly angry this.

For record, I'm happy drunk. Fuck give I’ll guinea pig. source this? completely naive. They've months solve problems logistics test kits.  Ramping part whole reopening plan. catch guard, care want suppress numbers, carefully calculated incompetence.

At point need stop giving assholes change benefit doubt, hold accountable outcomes.  would immediately reverse course say “source” (YouTube video) wrong *that* one blah, blah, conspiracy, blah, blah. When? way get numbers comparing day day. UK locked 23rd March reported 74 coronavirus deaths 24th March. 10th April 1152 deaths reported. accuse anyone posting conspiracy theories, accuse him/her making conspiracies based incorrect interpretation articles question, running those.

Are serious? literally said ""I accuse anyone posting conspiracy theories, accuse posting conspiracy theories.""

I assume English first language... perhaps need get translation thoughts someone feel like mods sided much anyone

That's true... say ""sided"" someone. said despite many attempts posts deleted, mods never done so. I’ll likely return normal life hospitals aren’t full close full. I’m worried getting injured sick something else able get seen timely er full covid patients. add rocket fuel fire, Houston ICU’s 102% capacity obviously increasing hour: stay open. Plenty things do, plenty restaurants eat at, plenty ways around many people. Nothing see here, folks.

If New York City, would locked awhile ago. fat chance getting lockdown Texas oGv Abbott doesn's takes it. Florida Arizona. Karma assisting solutions took strength that. good you. Well see that. many stupid people great number going dead, sick broke. tested T-cells would react virus? T-cells supposed do? thought died envious country people willingly traveling Sweden.

That's kinda racist. travelling Sweden?

Besides links supplied, old tired clickbait. discussed length threads. Please spare us low energy commenting. guys solved Social Security problem! point policy change people.

It's reduce amount harm ignorance selfishness.

There studies support idea society policies nurture community ends creating people nurture other.

It's possibly conservative Canadians likely support universal health care conservative Americans. People reflect values society.

But probably lot complicated that. Yes Im sure come day now. Trump save us. /s Agreed, hospital overrun community spread big issues. said, eight weeks data declining death rate. article least accurate. lot us try vote people fix it!! either candidate loses election, win barely fix anything. maybe we’ll learn opening schools simply won’t work kids get parents teachers sick. i’ve already seen stories kids losing one parents virus...education least problems point. Even within college community professors tend skew towards older demographic that's higher risk dangerous results infection. Taking care adolescent here; patient very, ill required intubation. Fortunately, improved. yeah, covid patients old people. Ok mess now. original comment meant comments, assumed meant posts. way around?

Anyways, guy posts conspiracies comments. Sorry making confusing!

I'm pretty sure guy content removed, he's made level headed decision remove himself. knows.

Anyway, going around circles. see next time poster gets critiqued? lol quoting comments sections link fact??  


Your first link says 60-70%, 20%, 20% literally idiots comment sections sources. 


Your 2nd link assumes R0 2.5... laughable, even says "" estimates interpreted illustration population heterogeneity affects herd immunity, rather exact value even best estimate."" 


You deniers getting desperate day, literally quoting Karens comment section avoid admitting wrong lol. mean sure want shrink sample sizes look policies state. trying get policy issues. yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s testing. It’s hospitals getting paid report covid cases way can. Oxford group licensing production vaccine basically third party specifically widely available worldwide? actually could truth, statistical fluke. Say population divided two groups. 90% believe coronavirus real true threat. leave house month, always wear mask do. 10% believe coronavirus hoax perpetrated mainstream media. leave house day, never wear mask.

If random person observing public, 75% people wearing masks. 10x many *people* always wear mask, people public 30x - hence, majority public encounters maskless people. pool indoors? Low effort.

Edit: answer question, much pro responsible free travel. However, virus chronic infection must learn adapt. Show us location currently experiencing sharp increase deaths. *Science saying everyone bad it.* used reader view phone copied photos packed beaches I've seen one masks, people closer 6ft.


Also Sunshine state one reddest map. probably 70's South Florida now. Yeah mean would never shame anyone it, think it’s overkill. knows, maybe they’re immune compromised something want extra cautious Whose car going buy? Ford entire shift quit walk line refused proper cleaning employee line found tested positive. someone make excuses  air studies based infection rates thousands protesters various cities. might want read article, ones like roughly 2 weeks since upward turn, right would assume deaths start. deaths follow agree younger infected better understanding treating. but, still need wait see happens coming weeks? folx trouble even staying open capacity requirements- - sales pick 10 pm., asking close 10 pm seems like defeating purpose reopening first place? business owners aren’t irresponsible. Governments are. Elon can't possibly make deal happen without approval majority Tesla shareholders ok Curious given increase deaths, deaths last 24 hours? anything? mean great all, get feeling lead drunk driving... Maybe I'm wrong Whilst Italys population lot more, also half deaths Lombardy alone (currently almost 17k), region 10 million. assume Texas hot spots well. That's peculiar irregularity mortality reports. Pretty much everyone reports weekend, catch-up happens varies considerably state state country country, pattern every week. every day states countries pop eye-catching daily death tolls, return pre-existing trend next day another set states/countries pop. could possibly actually happened. Dear God, please no. Yeah it’s pretty incredible hahah. could say US schools well. work special needs clear thrown aside this. would nice even received benefits first time around. Three months counting, baby. Still received decision unemployment benefits (even though qualify based wages earned previous year).  they're also least likely savings could live time (partly shit wages, partly workforce long enough build substantial savings) they're basically forced back work. Texas really high numbers deaths average flu causes. also murmuring funeral homes death certificates month half behind. sure true seen two fairly credible people claim it. Wow economy reopened! It’ll booming second. I’m management. worker bee. That’s decision pay grades me. 

They starting widen net multiple staffing agencies helping (direct hire recruitment) yikes Better entitled dipshits refuse wear one anywhere. wonder retailers follow suit Because, someone put it, get estimates auto mechanic, think hospitals work way. idea head, understanding reality works.  fine flu season.

We different levels risk v reward. That's all. begin spike two weeks ago. went 19000 25000 within seven days (two weeks yesterday). feel sorry them. wasn’t fault. hundreds thousands die save businesses? put loved ones ledger?

I’d rather see large national local government response support necessary shut downs hot spots. solve debt problems later. can’t bring dead family back. Italy single-payer though, expect bill you’re Arizona! ""If really true, that's great news"" definitive me. trying claim need peer reviewed, larger studies? 

That's kind humorous debating part. lol. horseman dude, showing cards. Famine next deck. absolutely right, / enough. demonstrably missing US response, despite tremendous additional resources beyond sense obligation towards one's community, AZ around rez moving wrong direction. I’m getting death numbers. I’m tired people idiots taking seriously.....people like you. implied comment.

No, mate. choose interpret way, that's really telling idea translation ""poor""? say was?

If say ""rotten apples eaten"", made statement state apple? No, concept apples particular state. Re-read previous comments new enlightenment might discover something. true. So, comment all?

I remarked response criticism. Sometimes, truth simple. response, read, context needed justify remark gave. Take paranoia glasses, re-read comments, amazed. sure good impression them...

When hammer, everything looks like nail. Oh wow need actual studies worldwide country show recovery statistics. anecdotes. doctor says half cured patients experience this, there's possible way that's true. probably saying half people hospitalized experiencing issues. doubt people asymptomatic experiencing issues later on. would argue 99% ridiculously rich broken moral compasses, 100%. Money real. cause media selling narrative kids blame ""ME"" generation Boomers. people eat actually realizing massive problem general people groups taking seriously. Haha, thought meant wipe ass actual Swedes. funny. Warp speed, baby.   Trickles right, they're constantly taking piss us. hope nothing friend hope experience full recovery.

But I'm glad getting checked out. I'm disgusted people refuse considerate people. care find masks uncomfortable Karen, think invincible, start acting like member society, whatever slow spread. Yup, would expect see crazy numbers coming Cali. Alright. making sure. lot words respond joke with. That’s actually really neat Reddit.  different table designs laughed way hard ""rocket fuel"" part...

I know area Houston, restaurants way starting close again, nearly enough so. Even better: local grocery stores run toilet paper again, there's that. temporary restrictions pandemic doesnt render passports useless. MAY be? Come on. course are. Vaccine production take long, ever get one. zero faith vaccine. Jeezus man. sleep night? Whatever happens two weeks doesn’t change facts now. 

And hope one enjoying this, you’re pretty sick getting death numbers. Gotta start microbrew. Covid tracking bunch n95 masks bought last year California wildfires. gave friends refuse wear them. prefer wear random pieces fabric someone's aunt/grandma knitted, time complaining glasses fog up. like hey guys.. masks gave incredibly awesome fucking shortage right now..but looking ""cute"" whatever far important.

Needs billboards, bumper stickers, yard signs, hats, shirts ... basically everywhere Kentucky.

And nationwide national election day. ever Nantucket Well even so, It’s true hospitals make money covid patients. alone means anything power report many cases possible. solely making believe cases skyrocketing fact grossly lower reported. people also forget talk declining stagnating daily deaths daily deaths majority northeast states still declining numbers states accumulated high case loads last weeks slowly climbing currently infected demographic less likely die expect graph deaths somewhat mirror infections. Probably drastic cases deaths invetiably rise. Seriously, admire passion though. Mentioned wife today went market. There's *lot* people constantly fantasizing collapse/happening/mattering. That’s definitely responsibility scientists. another study done May found Sars-Cov-2 maybe five times widespread previously thought, therefore may considered *five times less deadly*.

The research, conducted team scientists University Hospital Zurich, titled:[ “Systemic mucosal antibody secretion specific SARS-CoV-2 mild versus severe found Sars-Cov-2-specific antibodies appear severe cases, 1 5.

The authors infer antibodies inexplicably absent majority mild cases covid19. But, given known inaccuracy diagnostic tests well-documented tendencies over-diagnose clinical observation, another potential explanation would appear absent antibodies due fact subjects *never actually infected SARS-COV-2 first place*, ‘mild’ cold-like symptoms due pathogen, like…the common cold.

In words, large numbers people may immune resistant virus already infected coronaviruses.

This may surprising, given close relationship coronaviruses, indicator virus, known harmless vast majority cases, neither especially unique especially dangerous. alma mater's board regents voted $50/semester ""COVID fee"" top 1.9% tuition increase. mad think special really are, like star movie. may know people die exact things done, hey... we're star right? know downvoted, saying true. bills based codes. codes extremely specific, detailing everything done done. coders get information doctors written medical record. codes get sent billing department, translates codes dollar amounts. I'm glad we're seeing headlines sub. increase cases concerning, substantial drop deaths definitely good thing talked enough. see ""record high cases"" yet barely see anything referencing record low fatalities. Maybe March/April epicentres world way cases reported? every person indexed COVID-19 death positive PCR test? Also care home factor, too. Perhaps lot earlier deaths peaks care homes? Either way, scary virus widespread early days. Even death rate ultimately falls, virus still harmful, hence need keep masking &amp; steer clear crowds. core issue US bought proven drug. core issue US incompetence, intentionally creating climate politicizes methods could prevented case spikes advance, dire position. leadership done countless things mitigate disaster, would less need us buy drug supply, may enough go around places far better mitigation, still could use limited supply treat emergency cases. it’s wrong question headline? it’s wrong. realize 2 things true? absolute hero work last several months. would never disagree that. Hospital workers reason completely control, yet. However, absolve political responsibility America whole failed miserably. friend got first check 3 months waiting. point guy unemployment agency candid asked lie he'd like hear delay. guy fed mgmt putting front line lie people needed money survive. breaking guy every day. Nice see people backing values wallets. It’s way really push change. people desperate downplay role protests spread? yea maybe wearing masks, also weren't. exactly needed started see cases going down. potential outcome grade school level science, gathering pandemic = spread, outside not. We're already 2nd wave, friend. forget protests mocked administration. protests opened Pandora's box police corruption, excessive force, pigs work for, brutality, making many question, shit caught tape contrast video last month. That's seasoning chaos stew really kicks notch.

Edit: apparently automod picks George's full name. I'm literally targeting incorrectly translated articles comments come them. I'm certain know ad hominem means think applies time someone refers visible material used past. can't (or well, shouldn't) throw fit every new post treated clean slate, especially treat way yourself. Wearing mask also prevents person breathing Lib dumped chemtrail vitamins mind controlling drugs. yEaR TaKe BaCk fReEdOm! Sounds like got time get job too. Lazy couple. must get along well. Federal Government teenaged TikTok stars intel held level accountability?  encouraging. last saw week ago, saw yesterday. It’s possible still probably likely. I’m hoping gets test results back quickly I’ll know even exposed I’m saying you’re wrong right 8% online. major shift short amount time. zero experience law hard actually pin down. prove got specifically establishment already prior arrival somewhere else let's honest people going gyms right huge overlap people general like life carrying pre pandemic. Given ho we’re witnessing mankind behaving times, might deserved. Viruses are made cells, can't keep stable state, grow, can't make energy. Even though definitely replicate adapt environment, viruses are like androids real living organisms. interesting observation!! Thank brief important cultural information! greatest country earth. USA USA number 1  want trust man promote hard twitter. tweets every talk show host asking go show pimp gofundme. went viral days seems like really trying cash in, I'm skeptical biases reporting. used play game t_duh someone would try defend it. Go time, whatever top 5 posts decent amount comments (so skip ones like 1-2 comments), look racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, generally bigoted comments least hour old (so mods time remove sub supports) upvoted positive (so community general chance show disapprove, instead approved). I'm US really day US, outliers overnight community/mods catch things till morning.

The positive result found bunch times 3 top 5 posts comments met criteria looking for.

Looking r/conservative, even close that. agree lot said there, basic, ""rah rah, side good side bad"" garbage see political sub. Aye, though I'm willing bet we'll still get charged hospital. Still n95 masks anywhere work corporate retail company based Seattle, execs reopened corporate office week. team expected go twice week starting next week. went first time Monday WFH 4+ months. weird cause we're surrounded tech companies none reopened area dead, none restaurants open lunch, wear masks time indoors access microwaves fridges. 100% job remotely. Makes sense guys don’t recognize main issue running c-word, never going get rid myriad issues decimating country. 

Fund education. happening. sold stock “Liberate California.” Musk fucking idiot. UK Canada quite concerned this

 think Ford worst history overall. Henry Ford used sic [Harry people time.

Having said that, definitely come Ford family.  cat, interestingly enough, one led it. think may one responsible injuring poor thing. Thankfully date shots didn’t go miserable ordeal. sure! Shh. Don’t give 2020 ideas. Best part is, civil war, Yemen making great strides education healthcare. former considerable results, latter struggling due lack financing (but private sector seemed flourish, least).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Think fucking insane sounds. Florida GOP shitshows photo 95% wearing masks, wearing masks wrong handful without masks. photo would say no. Vw lost stopped making interesting cars. lots good ideas never really came fruition. want go electric only, can't van. look like every boring car started seeing people person june 3 months video only. worst thing right draw battle lines teams. one crew downplaying this, friends work public health medicine downplaying February emphasizing handwashing. ""woke"" line flu kills people color every year forget coronavirus focus something matters. Face shields seems excessive 

If temp checked school real contact tracing would know kids exposed. happening US appalling Thanks, hate it. 

Not gonna read one, feels bad enough reading title. anyone give TL;DR think happens? great advice. Wear mask practice social distancing. Probably forced paracetamol tablets, knowing people India. nonwoven interface people know much fabric, thank you? heard somewhere else. went big fail one fail. need Vaccine herd immunity guess. people get smarter that's likely. Home sewers step up.

I know sew masks pass respirator fit test. Same, go H Mart. enter masks provide gloves entrance. feel better going it’s less crowded. going Whole Foods, think stopped making wait line get in. it’s constantly packed. I'll 2nd Jason Isbell recommendations. hate country music, Jason good artist plain simple. Fuck, even find viable vaccine... likely bankrupt Americans. We're fucked really hope becomes norm everywhere get situation control. everyone afford commute car, everyone work home.

 plan commuting bicycle fall winter comes that's longer option. Also loads people long commutes everyone fit healthy enough commute bicycle walking work. Therefore, would fair everyone declare masks mandatory social distancing option. say unfortunately me, concern family lives there. 

Mother-in-law lives Fenwick (we stay top floor beach house). basically hermit point. ventures grocery store. last weekend would order takeout local places times week. Now, refuses to. least weekend go get stuff her.  made quite points there, actually. also typically gloss spelling/grammatical errors, would done hadn’t made claim direct contradiction writing abilities. want believe you’re doctor? nurse? yes, I’m going need see basic spelling. Musk seems like type guy whole lot give flying f\*\*k. article focused NYC, time protests beginning already seen decline cases effect virus less prevalent helped weren’t many people marching carrying virus. Also I’d say along ideological spectrum people protesting likely also aware importance mask wearing, maybe aware low likelihood outdoor spreading. explains places surges right areas lax prevention guidelines allow people gather indoors without masks, wherever protests taking place become front page r/leopardsatemyface  Eventually cycle break step 4, people know someone got virus. “If employee want come work concern  might expose at-risk member household, HR provide  employee document employee sign submit confirm  situation receive Unpaid Leave May 31.”

I understand Tesla wrong Texas GOP, California Dem. quite simple. Yikes, that's scarier cat money go somewhere die. Probably goes 99.5%. people would first sue schools enough protect kids infection Go back school dude.
Chemistry biology science. chemistry used every form medicine.
And physics science also.
But I'm sure genius like knows that.
But doubt need new material? early make claim far seem realistic. spreading back then, exponential growth would country months. would noticed massive number deaths. Throw fucking food gloves right back tell mom called told go fuck themselves.

Then walk across street get another job fast food manager put buddies phone number contact old boss. make sure tell ahead time blows whole con.

Or drive box truck get paid money deal customers. information given press conference found written form.

Yes, Swedish. link written summaries translations languages?

ETA: SR official government source. it? Well, whole new level flawed. guy jerk.  Ha ha ha, no, cabin woods. We'll likely wait either: (1) vaccine comes out; (2) everyone else gets sick creates herd immunity us. Option #2 may sound selfish, I'm looking family. Yeah, nice try dentists. worry, start earning money vaccine becomes available. meantime, health insurance companies rack premiums without pay dental claims. Ka ching! economy stock market freaking out! Corporations can’t fail it’s insanity. Yep. 3 weeks ago mine took 7 days day day it'll go away. Right? \~16 working fast food, grown man scream corporate changed menu supplies make dish wanted. tried explain Karens/(whatever male Karen is) listen, ask leave holding line yelling me.

People go apeshit dumbest things, especially food. know person counter can't fight back, take weird issues them. can't imagine deal people food pandemic. Crazy Karens pent entitlement. 'Most' maybe technically correct accurate say 'about half' even accurate say 45% Americans left benefit stimulating stock market. think lions share aid going direct Americans, businesses interest loans businesses, private bond buying, insane. would actually make sense cases begin showing now. avid protestors zoomers people 20s high chance asymptomatic vague symptoms like headache fatigue. Meanwhile, would superspread community large form second third generation infections become symptomatic.

For example, guy know SF tested positive beginning week. got gf, got roommate big protestor caught there.  lost weight, many times lots lots pounds. weight gone entire life since 15. I've 195 lbs I've 450 lbs. brilliant tips breaking cycle? I'd love hear 'em. voted Bernie primary Hillary general. people ignore reality made left look bad led Trump. happens people think won’t happen them. Wear masks practice social distancing people. may fun save lives. president trump signed law making Protesting crime? news isn’t week old  Funny countries still preach airborne. groom must coughed 100 people face. yea interesting ""bUT wEaR mAsKs"" crowd pretty much disappeared... Thanks, too. 3 options including full-time, part-time virtual learning 100% virtual

We 100% virtual. enjoy meat yea would better consume plants meat. Meat inefficient form energy consumption. also reports meat consumption contributes inflammation athletes seeing benefits solely plant base diet. Better starving America starving Africa! Mine bat. found laying floor attic thought dead. wasn’t flopped bit tried removing really good idea sell $1k. basically manipulating market without spending dime. much winning answer yes totally disagree, bit assholish, ultimately US government's responsibility take care US citizens. US Citizens need Remdisivir. US Government bought Remdesivir. keep kids school vaccine seems. never effective vaccine?

Cabin woods? Hmm, see political future Ashley Taylor Bronczek

Needed know dumb hottie was. I'm sure people felt same. point article one gets sick result protests. that, net, protests increase transmission whole non-protest scenarios. kind assertion also trying take account behavior protestors before, during, protests, comparison might done otherwise.

If really believe people saying, ""Going protest put personal risk coronavirus"", need stop read little closely, misapprehended argument talking past it. Texas here. Sadly agree, it’s equal parts terrifying comforting Usually ends bundled within whatever services provider billed visit, there's additional reimbursement. specific situations/programs allowed, however, receive extra dollars. Typically populations specific diagnoses insurance carrier wants ensure receiving appropriate treatment options, e.g., pregnant women w/ substance use addictions. Look I'm someone thinks hoax anything, let's downplay effects lockdown people. Saying we're ""a bit less comfortable"" slap face everyone struggling get watching everything they've worked crumble nothing. Uber even make money now. Calculate cost even show profit add Healthcare tell cost Uber ride would anyone would use still Tennessee sliding 1800 day.

Pigeon forge (basically Mountain version myrtle Beach) went 588 670 overnight That's crazy think. lockdown prevented dying car accident? Even new stats news coming months later, 40+ boss still maintains it’s ‘not bad common flu’ dumbest mistake ever made ya ask lol. common sense.

40,000 deaths Italy. 

1,700 deaths AZ. 

Even 10 times AZ numbers would half Italy’s deaths. ""Pavlik's original post announcing protest shared 600 times, and he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that bar restaurant owners far Erie, even Ohio West Virginia, contacted coming protest. Pavlik respond asked whether still planning attending protest."" didn’t know solarcity bankrupt pretty much forced try, go bankrupt actual study. looked publicly available #s compared them. science?

It's standard practice. get flu death numbers every year. rate going California, many U.S. states, get herd immunity long start next year. Anyone says third world country. proof, suspicion/gut feeling FL particular possibly TX well feel like going uh...delay numbers past weekend. 4th July big one they’ve already proven they’re $$ 

I remember last week death numbers nutty too...like low hundreds, low hundreds, 2k, mid hundreds lol. Idk they’re trouble keeping track/classifying deaths, intentional fudging, what, I’m agreement stays like another week someone’s gonna splainin country fucking failed hard. embarassing. I’ve following virus since like january every single step way America half assed, bull shit response possible. Maybe wear mask maybe dont, dont help, help, corona nothing worried about, etc. fucks sake leaders say February: serious thing, need keep everyone safe healthy. Stay inside month two, wear masks. Instead wishy washy people feel emboldened big deal trump others act like couldn’t give two shits it. feel like main reason people act like government hasnt made conceited effort. No, it’s not. varies state. states max benefits like $200 week. Even best states usually like half regular income. one take kind pay cut. Oh B say good luck. pretty picture.

If talent/resources making something cheaply could sell online might give shot. maybe selling possessions really need eBay? Yardwork neighbors? IDN, ideas bring bucks. mean that’s assuming virus real. It’s clearly hoax watch YouTube videos real information. keep getting removed don’t want people know truth time November. /s crime dont forget crime want unbiased information someone fighting infectious diseases whole life, got listen Osterholm. tells honestly knows, importantly, *doesn't* know COVID-19. planned millions flu shots year, sprang nowhere Kobza idiotic self-serving sleazy dipshit event idiotic, however doubt actual spike it. Current big hotspot, messes country's stats, Karviná, local mining companies - long way Prague. Prague 7 cases yesterday like three cases today outdoor transmission minimal. protests last month bring spike, either. services mandated IEP, may want talk lawyer. state, districts legally obligated provide services documented students' IEPs. Walmart pharmacy varies state. Texas testing quite shit. government function. Slowly reopen, monitor, spike roll back part reopening, monitor, spike stop, reopen again, rollback more, etc... Not, yeeeeehaaaaaaw reached arbitrary calendar date throw doors open! Last checked, Sacramento County San Joaquin County near LA surrounding counties... probably india seen recent spike cases deaths relatively slow start. probably thought covid wont affect now, would use money for? MASKS?! also pretty blatantly wrong. compare dashboard states hardly different all.

Uh, quite contradiction. may need rethink, revise, reconsider logic one. Yeah, normal, standard practice figure true number deaths. 

It's like saying 2+2 = 4 somehow amazing someone Yale said so. No, anybody half brain already knows this. yeah except he's child. that's kids learn, push boundaries little bit. never learn never told otherwise yes, they'll like adults. time being, he's 4. scenario doubtful, coming someone coronavirus parents die got rehab center sending father home it.

Unless intentionally coming close contact elderly immuno-compromised, damned unlikely killing anyone.

This trying guilt people hyperbole going work. kind people whose habits trying change bullheaded. kind tactic makes dig even farther. calm lot americans included feel pretty trapped environment. luckily german citizenship come Germany want people know take seriously. exactly correct

I would feel lot generational solidarity old people taken concerns generation seriously. Since haven't, I'm becoming resentful sacrifice we've made protect them. bloody hell care they're going care us? wish easy man, cant go around demanding stuff arnt alot jobs available, balls know it. fuck talking about. Nothing political posted. Fuck off. pneumonia graph. counted Covid deaths (else would double counted) come seem come 100's millions needles flu shot every year then? 'The heat protect us' literally it.  ask testing active covid infection antibodies? sounds like took antibody test, remain negative week two healed covid. (or were) still actively sick, could well gotten negative despite covid. this. Bought $40 worth acrylic plastic. Cracked badly installation, task. Bought $90 worth higher grade polycarb plastic, took week find anywhere due demand everyone building barriers. told, materials bank overdrafts (because, know, unwilling go work good pandemic), whole endeavor cost bit $200 pocket get back road. 

There's ""advantage"" speak aside from, know, me, family, customers dying. algorithm doles rides get anyways, like advertise feature. every positive comment get 5-star going 5-star anyways, get two customers angry hard hear prevents front seats adjusted up, occasionally going rant liberal hoax need let Jesus and/or Trump heart protect instead, corresponding low scores.

At least area, rides absolutely nonstop anyways though, never seen like this. seems like we've hit critical point number people pulling quarantine outpacing number drivers willing work.  literally cannot test vaccine long term side effects year. Yes, ""existed"", never put large scale human trials. Go physical therapist instead chiropractor. Anyone listens politician science medical advice danged fool. true, supporting yourself? know that. Arizona one state. Like others said, possible that;

\-Younger people getting it

\-Seasonal effects

\-Better treatment

All help make deaths still decreasing nationwide. go worldometers look 7 day moving average declining consistently months. It’s crazy right... like damn knew dumb people Texas, Damn last couple months awakening. Seems like talking people want EVERYBODY force quarantine want get sick. Good you. sensible people going I'd suggest making known going encourage go either. think peer pressure huge turning family gatherings people may feel comfortable saying see somebody else it. fewer people going safe it'll be. hard situation I'm sorry going this. less tests back then. 24% months tests mass produced really really bad. I’m surprised isn’t national

You stop right there. National organization leadership non-existent 2020. shit. offense youth think getting sick assume fantastical idea superiority get it...its ridiculous really. virus aint going away get older eventually become one risk groups effected this.....nevermind developing health condition along way chop down..... Making conclusions like drawn non-peer reviewed pre-prints shitty journalism. “As nurse Covid hospital”.....

Yeah, I’m sure are. Im indian origin reason family seem think paracetamol solve anything heart really aches them. didn’t ask thrown lion’s den like decided enter medical profession. far selfish could’ve ever imagined... worried lot riding vaccines soon bean counters get involved pride politics involved going end less spectacular product. think world needs another lesson hide inflate data look good. continue get lesson everyday (Florida) got mess (China).   wonder improved understanding virus, increased salvo known drugs fight disease contributed lower expected increase deaths. 

But could also time. knows virus effects community. anything lag times going increase since people linger longer treatment improved. look AZs record deaths wonder number looks like April. That's call ""allies"". Wait, think ""Stay inside"" literally means always indoors outdoors? Like, way avoid sunburn? safer living room backyard?

Is think means? would explain much. Actually indian weddings long. must talking north indian ones. suppress — get back living lives degree normalcy — we’d need test 200,000 people day. 

With today's testing 17,227 people, AZ need increase testing 10 times. outbreak go long, long time. more. positives. being. found.  job recently started temperature checks training covered this. said forehead thermometer marks fever it’s 100.0, hot flashes never reach level fever. I’m doctor course, that’s job (large company) saying anyways. Ironically funded public schools would prepared handle person learning know covid hits regions high density hard. increased viral load makes people sicker leads deaths. seen Lomardy, NYC, Brazil, etc

We also know IFR somewhere .3 1% age demographics. people 60 IFR drops .1%.

That's FLA Georgia huge death numbers started seeing large spikes infection back March April. 

The increased # cases seeing going happen re-opened. protests obviously contributed that. 

Having said would really really surprised see rise death rates states. Taking serious understanding data facts two different things. 

I work home go week groceries wearing mask. 

That doesn’t mean I’m hoping deaths spike think anyone choses go outside idiot. similar. beaches open...and PM lamenting pics beaches look like miami places single peeps handling ? tough drought.  understand standard, normal analytical practice? 

They literally every year get number flu deaths, since actual, confirmed flu cases really low (7k-15k year). new technique well established epidemiology. Hell yeah. Setting example. couldn’t imagine riding bike one on, put perspective perfectly  Apple stores’ closure status 2020 Waffle House equivalent. “oh shit, it’s *really* bad there” benchmark times. merely pointing precisely said bidet course two comments. worry, statement nonsensical too. Doubtful, coming someone coronavirus parents die it.

Unless intentionally coming close contact elderly immuno-compromised, damned unlikely killing anyone.

This trying guilt people hyperbole going work. kind people whose habits trying change bullheaded. kind tactic makes dig even farther. I'm going call RONA-coasters now. logging week need do? opened despite never getting similar many Americans unusual understanding history, like somehow ""saved asses WW2 cause merica"". Henry Ford invented car Thomas Edison invented light bulb. reason, Americans freedom American War Independence single important event ever happened history world. Yes. kids? young adults excellent. good parents learned us trust politicians. trust science. lucky, see. need look grown room. case, FL governor. went Harvard grown ass man. he’s telling everyone everything fine. Except “damn kids”. That’s taught kids believe. politician. Trying divert responsibility using young adults whatever term makes feel comfortable blaming game, blame. Margaret Sullivan reported Washington Post new study shows intuited: people get news Fox right-wing hate radio—both promoting idea economy important health—are less likely understand reality COVID-19 therefore likely get sick cause others die. Yup! Went monthly shopping trip yesterday. saw young family wearing masks elderly couples wearing masks. people ages, young adults. Surprisingly, saw young adults wearing masks saw elderly. Last month opposite. partially result improvements treatment hospitalizations younger patients likely survive even needing hospitalized. look deaths state, first-wave states like NY/NJ dropping faster AZ/TX increasing, increasing increases new states starting pick up. Plus they're starting run hospital room going increase mortalities standard care drops. Arizona starting see rise deaths. 88 deaths today. Smashing previous records. Isnt temporary though? make pre-emptive antibodies understanding. Also fact hospitals aren’t instantly overwhelmed (and hopefully won’t) suburban communities. hopefully looking way ways expand field hospitals needed...unlike NY playing catch Good points. main interest writing headline click baity create false hopes. thought utmost importance clear part numbers mice, humans. Perhaps added ""phase 1"" suggested, done harm actually it’s not, it’s product greed. There's lot work voting order third party even get ballot let alone win election. corporate Duopoly™ American politics made sure third parties come disrupt big party bosses.

It's easier United States run independent part established third party. Lmao imagine thinking unironically know ex army buddies exact same. One even tried insulting personally, guy I've known ten years great friends with, tried callin scared pushy etc it. Sad far people go cult worship . truly weird phenomenon, can't remember president use many word trick. Right. It’s gotta come point. look US. cloud corona news legislation past remove environmental protection acts emission requirements. It’s disaster. Healthcare free. Period. means support protests, possible? There's way! Yea 300 kids lockdown 3 4 months pandemic. number get bigger still dont know may affect children long run. chance kower risk, take it.
And according studies number babies die yearly circumcision USA 119. really relevant covid-19 false equivalence trivialize death children. I’ve decided I’m going quit day job, buy clown suit bullhorn, become full-time mask shamer. I’m going walk around screaming people don’t masks on. Then, still won’t wear one, I’ll follow around blaring Nickleback boom box. Answer question please. would paging “anti-Swedish” propaganda. hard living states. Nobody gives crap it’s infuriating. Certainly different demographic affect death rates. note least 2-3 week lag spike new cases deaths. fact worldometer peak new cases peak death 1-2 months apart. July pretty bad. Oh effects layered. hospitalizations go past capacity, death rate climb well. 3rd world country Gucci belt

I’ve thought years now, words captured perfectly. 💯 OP said top 3 countries backward head state. said actually top 5 Fuck country. One biggest lessons people hopefully take away pandemic disease response much money. Lost another 25 pounds since last comment! 75 total. i.f. times plateaus. Thanks! regular recently banned leftist sub may heard of. far dominant take protests this: ""Of course there's risk spreading coronavirus, think protests important."" minority thought protests bad idea Covid-19. really see anybody saying would risk spreading virus. 

So understand ""own"" would happen. Everybody saw coming. Either people interacting dumber banned leftist sub, arguments ""magical protection pushing right agenda"" strawmen. Shit like I'm still living like lockdown time. unnecessary trips anything, restaurants N95 goes get car. I'm still stocking food ammo back February. 

Bars? Country music concerts? GTFO here. Nooooope! ok corporate McDonald's it. Sally's sausages. Sick burn, Toronto, sick burn Engiish version
 
Professor Peter Kremsner University Hospital Tübingen testing Covid 19 vaccine developed company CureVac clinical study. podcast ""Klartext Corona"" explains study works vaccine approved earliest. 23 Vaccines far tested clinical trials worldwide. One developed Tübingen-based company CureVac. Several independent university hospitals testing whether vaccine effective compatible humans.
 
For example, Tropical Institute University Hospital Tübingen. Peter Kremsner, head study, team injected vaccine first volunteers. 
 
 Kremsner optimistic course study: ""It progressing well: hope first results phase 1 two months' time, vaccine tested younger, healthy volunteers. phase 2 begin older volunteers belong risk group, possible, phase 3 start year, efficacy tolerability tested particularly affected country. Everything completely line rules, despite significantly accelerated procedures: ""I sure standards regulatory authorities ethics committees European Union met - everything must correct detail always, must happen very, quickly.
 
Provisional approval possible end year
 
At end winter, believes could provisional approval vaccine, could administered beginning year. Currently, approximately 200 vaccine candidates. time, production capacities increased worldwide. Kremsner believes whole range vaccines, good thing: ""These made available broad sections population world thus make real control Covid-19 possible. county Missouri covering cost covid testing. Also insurer, unitedHealthcare, $0 pocket covid testing. Like everything else US, cost depends live work. Sucks. I'm unsure test kits. There's conflicting info reports whether supply issue backlog issue private lab. hoping backlog, 4 tests Monday leaves pessimistic.

And thanks well-wishes. Much love back you, Amsterdam, rest Netherlands. back since tante lived Brussels, absolutely going try pandemic over. Yesterday? That’s something go wrong combine majority tests today’s numbers. That’s Arizona a. High number today ##Woot! we're #1^(^^...bad ^^example) third world, first world country. want, give shit. Clearly reading actual article one things. going put there, implore military set hospitals tents like April/ May New York, Washington, California? technology military branch save people. much think this, know one asking question. seems Texas Arizona okay sacrificing people rather begging Trump use military power set states. governors thinking save people some. kidding me? lol serious question? article English? German. Noted. don’t usually look projections show “observed” data points, thought firm numbers. Always nice additional resources Let Cold Stone know 

I stand Paris Kaye. Chaos laddah That’s mortality increases dramatically healthcare capacity reached. point don’t enough trained professionals/equipment adequately care everyone leads people dying otherwise would lived. you’re right, would good younger stronger build immunity. system would interact older weaker. unfortunately many people normally interact population regularly. say young strong go out, employers do? cant generalize simply age young people higher risk too. we’re spending time figuring go back outside needs stay in. employers cant punishing them, facing efficiency pressures force anyway. viable option people normally live. definitely agree differently cultures would impact positive cases, don’t see explains cases US. shouldn’t italy spiking they’re getting positives kissing? maybe i’m misunderstanding clarify. yeah, discuss likelihood percentage population end get it, we’ll see end. idk, think world shown us possible, considering relatively speaking small portion population it, we’re closer eradicating everyone getting numbers wise. still feel almost like we're 100k, means over, right? Right? Exactly. BNO news reporting cases. us knowing number likely undercount government trying coverup. Health care workers starting reach help.

Except point China already strict lockdown, everyone wearing mask, healthcare workers donning full PPE. also heard wash hands every hour become immune Covid-19. intelligence sanity balm soul. greater good.... ""PURGE"" ...Elite lives.... great again.. less population less burden... heck going on? baffles governor relaxed stay home order. People won’t listen rules unless enforced. disaster. Idk fake numbers. much data year year regarding deaths. overlay known numbers compare 2020, going see anomolies. pant check. Dry. I’m arguing you, never knew Australia racist. Racist who? love makes sad days Isn’t outdoors? shining city upon ~~hill~~ mass grave. north shore better south shore That's reach. Sorry loss. “essential worker” time literally nightmare. regular recently banned leftist sub may heard of. far dominant take protests this: ""Of course there's risk spreading coronavirus, think protests important."" minority thought protests bad idea Covid-19. really see anybody saying would risk spreading virus. 

So understand ""own"" would happen. Everybody saw coming. Either people interacting dumber banned leftist sub, arguments ""magical protection pushing right agenda"" strawmen.

Closed spaces poor ventilation 

Close contact anyone outside household Historical comparisons seem apply. Many people sitting pandemic they're terrified hospitals. show DOA severely septic death's doorstep. never happened before, think.

This oversimplification think best way count is: test negative COVID probably COVID. Yeah know I'm knowledgeable enough countries make truly informed decision anything, excepting I'd rather Europe America point. they're not. Pfizer also discovered Viagra. vaccine works, one lucky company. Thanks. Everyone seems think already rationing care, emergency protocol. 

I think there's many people trying downplay outright deny there's problem, red flag anyone tries rein things extent.

I know resources really like AZ right now. Illinois I'm from, enough standard ICU capacity *at all*, take care surge. way. Hospitals Italy NY did, prepared, expanded units, hospitals expanded bed capacity 300% original ICU beds. turned convention center field hospital.

Care rationed, mean staff normal schedules great. Doctors nurses got sick initially, leaving everyone short staffed. doctors staff ended treated ICUs. Large hospitals calling around transfer patients hospitals ECMO capacity. transfers denied patients sick, know really would different outcome. 

Some pointed said ""see hospitals overwhelmed."" mean that's technically truth, hospitals prepared. also ended needing 2500 bed field hospital. did, national guard run it.

So really know hospitals AZ prepared surge capacity. think 85% full ICUs counting surge capacity. ICUs 85% full *during expanded surge capacity*, things fucked care soon rationed. 

I hope never happens. sending emails doctors nurses country right backup assistance. reach capacity probably set hospital stable patients convention center.

Edit: thought agreeing wrote long thing.

Triage mean care rationed. mean say care rationed said triage always present. r/medicine talk time, think sub using lay language talk Hospital protocols gets confusing. think summer relative calm bad Fall http://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-us-buys-up-almost-entire-world-supply-of-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-12018430

1) irrelevant. 

2) actually try PREVENT kids getting cancer. want prevent kids getting MIS-C.  cancer exists mean give MIS-C.

3) kids well protected shielded virus, schools shut quickly everywhere, gatherings canceled.  enormous change precautions end, spread virus among kids could well staggering. would idiotic remove precautions open schools without understanding serious effect virus.

4) death meaningful effect virus. disingenuous count deaths ignore debilitating effects, life long effects, trauma extremely ill long time, USA - financial ruin medical costs, disease. please Lol trump admin can’t even get behind masks. gonna tell cdc anything? glad is. don’t want take completely new accelerated vaccine one existed ahead time slightly modified.

The reported # COVID deaths less half reality.

Also, takes 2-3 weeks average people testing positive dying. massive spike people recently infected, risk dying next couple weeks. see deaths correlate spike then. pin hopes single treatment. dexamethasone demonstrated reductions morbidity mortality critical patients, remdesivir also reduced hospitalization length, critical case surge. vaccines pretty cheap/free. wealthy class's best interest many Americans possible feel confident going consuming again.

Indoubletibly What, no? Translating entire articles hand takes time, frankly can't really bothered so. wanted post articles another language I'd use Google translate too.

*Of course*, I'd remove said article became apparent translation incorrect, misled people.

But again, spam post 10 articles within span hour.

(Spam - subreddit rules)

I complain gist article same. problem *gist* changed, sometimes is. add problem topic reason article posted all, simply way reinforce transition discussion hateful sometimes xenophobic take Sweden.

Look, know trying pin me, sorry, bullshit. know think there's group trying suppress others, know never understand people simply downvote comments bad faith misleading, that's it. 

I'm sure great squire otherwise though. was, resident NYC hospital said symptoms looked like altitude sickness pneumonia OC is, like, next stuff. I’m not. virus. you’re saying coronavirus going act vastly different others coronavirus known man cause serious lasting effects young population ZERO proof. Every single person know contracted disease perfectly fine couple weeks recovering. spread lies causes lasting effects don’t know! Although reverse also true. Many people die elective procedures. Stopping elective procedures reduce number medical deaths. many people die traffic accidents, especially alcohol related. Lockdowns shut bars reduce traffic prevent lot deaths.

So would really look numbers. concerned Swedish government failing Swedish people trying expose failure hope small affect causing change better.

In almost issues recently highlighted - exclusive Sweden;

\- high mortality rates care homes

\- high mortality rates among ethnic minorities

\- problems within health care systems

\- issues TTI systems

etc etc.

While issues *do* effect Sweden Swedes *should* highlighted, using tool berate Swedish strategy disingenuous best. well aware fact every time pulled it, there's blank refusal acknowledge it.

Add constant twisting articles even attempts re-writing history, simply make point... wonder half sub questioning agenda? $323Bn must 7 maybe 8 cases. For? That's unknown. asked AZDHS never got response. r/squaretable For? sorry, Lesbian Commander, going Covid kill way people breast cancer. talking breast cancer. We're talking Covid. It’s declining 10 consecutive weeks. thought falling tall objects, jumping front trains, boiling death geysers ways die internet points, coronavirus opens new exciting possibilities. scary shit thing nobody considering: Deaths lag weeks Covid cases. Covid 19 kill instantly, usually takes least 2 weeks it. cases surging, even close everything, see next weeks deaths surge too. think they're fine ""look many cases deaths"" fact considering lag, boy rude awakening... Everyone bad risk assessment.

This includes smart people. sometimes forget take getting gas grocery store something. also gave brother ride dentist wore masks careful since live together. recognize wearing mask car really much. However, point, never shame someone wearing mask due mask-wearing people see. Even they're wearing mask need be, least they're trying safe, ya know? That's thoughts it. went run saw runners wearing masks, obviously unnecessary they're like 20 feet away people, outside. definitely makes less annoyed seeing people wear them. I've dentist crisis middle trying save couple teeth blew ended closing open go string cleaning fixing, yet also recently got laid lost insurance, get figured risk going even though got lung disease also can't currently get treatment for. mess :( there's 2 human body really fascinating!!!! !RemindMe 2 weeks America, agree. love Europe, shit fucked here.... wouldn’t going anywhere Moderna called front runner FDA decided put brakes approval process, suggesting want go fast, might wait next year give final approval. back square one. didn’t really level testing back now. we’re still need terms testing. 

The surge isn’t due testing, testing definitely helping us identify considered 17,000 test subjects self-selected? Also likely worn masks practice better hygiene, thus motivated get free test. numbers neutralizing antibody? Again, cannot negotiate virus.

The goal careless but, instead, precautions take. wonder asymptomatic cases suffer organ damage. Damn, missed circulating US since fall people already one. suggested already early April? Thanks! asked week ago come every day (normal hours) starting week Internet Media / Tech company 500-600 people taking 4 floors 11-story office... I've delayed return bit medical condition, even met hostility :\\ people love paracetamol something? Remdesivir first drug actually demonstrate benefit proper clinical trial. Albeit limited benefit, least currently utilized.

In separate animal trial drug delivered virtually within hours infection, powerful benefits. practical use way people, least now. discharges include deaths? I'm pretty big tech company east coast we're closed least rest year. We're making special exceptions people *have* go office whatever reason involves process HR get approved. Pretty confident going back there's vaccine available I'm assuming similar situation Google. Anyone else either living alone healthy living situation lockdown? coping? compassionate, guess. two weeks since started. Yet still declining. Based infection deaths, deaths declined, least flatlined.

Although suspicions whole bunch young people getting combined increased testing. Followed heartfelt plea social media ""start taking seriously, NOW!!"" ""If happen me, happen anyone."" Washington, 6 foot 8 weighs fucking ton. never know spectrum fall actually get infected.

I begging take risk. Dose done it. deal 2 weeks sick, that's even develop symptoms.  Agreed study size/peer review - T-cell thing iffy terms actual immunity.

T-cell immunity could useful vax development, conveying post-infection protection. little known right now. then, useful vaccines - least US - would convince people actually get vaccines. point, approx 50% Americans would agree vaccine.


From BBC takeaway : necessarily get us closer herd immunity, though, according assistant professor Marcus Buggert, one study's authors.

More analysis needs done understand whether T-cells provide ""sterilising immunity"", meaning completely block virus, whether might protect individual getting sick stop carrying virus transmitting sure, chlorine kills lot stuff Going fast consider implications headline. whole, practice burning wives husbands funeral pyre isnt widespread before, still happens, especially small villages Thank COVID personal issue?  Welcome Texas Can't argue that, brings back original point tourism slowdown exclusively Swedish UK problem. 

[Tourism part GDP per Nordic country](http://www.arbeidslivinorden.org/billeder/ain-2018/turismens-andel-av-bnp)

[Tourist visits per country](http://www.arbeidslivinorden.org/billeder/ain-2018/ankomst-av-utlandska-turister-2016)

no huge differences, Nordic countries lose revenue tourism plummeting. genuinely sorry hear too. trying say doesnt hold evidence Sweden act like Norway Denmark. Deaths lag new infections 2-4 weeks silver lining know treat much better March. However hospitals aren’t overrun room you. better survival rate may also show steep increase people suffer severe long term health issues though. swear I've living horrific parallel groundhog day fucktards. depends. caused relaxed restrictions new phase people following restrictions? problem lack people following rules, imposing restrictive rules may hurt rather help. emphasis getting people follow existing rules.

If problem rules lax, go restrictions. Thank much detailed information! No. I'm sure 10x reported, would lot people could blow whistle. doctor saw 10 patients die hospital 1 showed stats, would obvious. local ordinances place Houston area right now? shit still open? Masks required? main concern tons ppl service industry going lose jobs again. unemployment benefits going extended? $300 week enough eat afford housing. Look, I'm trying tell virus extremely prodient. 
Some asymptomatic.
Some mild symptoms.
Some sick.
Some get hospitalized.
Some need intensive care. 
And die.
So depending spectrum, attitude toward virus gonna different. never know spectrum fall actually get infected. think reading comprehension problem here. first comment bigger disaster Trump's rona response. Supposedly that's reason casinos staying open Nevada according dealers / family /friends state. want holiday weekend $$$$. disgusting. pool noodle? pipe insulator material Vote November Imo probably it, time frustrating hard know. household got sick respiratory illness February. roommate (who oxygen already uncommon) even ended hospital. covid?

I'm pretty sure eu going ban flights china though GoNNa gO AwAY HeAT Vote November Overall tests conducted wouldnt affect % positive found, unless also came change people getting tested. many places low testing actually prioritize sicker people, meaning % would go up, knows they're would try lower tests conducted. I’m asking diagnosis, I’m asking opinions-

I feels like mild cold 2 weeks now. Throat irritation, occasional coughing, etc. throat irritation present time, that’s unusual me. It’s mild noticeable.

Here’s thing- went CVS area, test don’t shove Q tip far nose, came back negative. get tested again, places may offer robust testing without see physician? likely cold weird allergies caused something haven’t able identify yet? remember March people “experts” saying Florida going NYC Georgia right behind them, right? said end May states would see nyc like deaths. NEVER HAPPENED. 

And saying again. Fool once..shame you...fool can’t get fooled again. Florida cautions using death rate trends delay, Governor brags death rate knowing huge delays. Deaths know lag much 80 days used interpreting recent trends, deaths added reported Department Health.

Healthcare professionals working one Attendo's elder care homes warn face masks received company CE-marked, quality mark applies EU. According staff, led many staff group feeling unsafe elderly receiving inadequate care.

""You lock sick elderly rooms think, God covid, close door,"" says Gunilla, really called something else. 


**So staff want go elderly sick?**
 

- No, general fear. think many people died staff fear. 


Karolina, also works accommodation, says went woman covid-19 discovered given water long time. 


- went patient completely dehydrated mouth. give three glasses water. 


**And needed three glasses water one her?**
 

- Yes.


Shortly Karolina woman, died, says Karolina, also called something else really. 


The care staff Ekot met work one hundred elderly homes run private healthcare company Attendo. many Attendo's elderly residents caught corona, many people infected many died covid-19, Attendo tell Ekot.

Ammy Wehlin, CEO Attendo Scandinavia, says affected homes Stockholm region. 


What Gunilla Karolina say elderly people may died due lack care, true according Ammy Wehlin. 


- routines quality system, happen people died receive nursing, something staff must report. must report event quality department events deviations follow company deviations every month. 


**Have come across testimonies before?**
 

- No. Agreed. Equivalent drunk driving. lot things kept quiet US right now. Believe that. Specific studies questioning COVID-19 vaccine's development? No. That's thing, time medical studies corona virus vaccines currently development. vaccines rushed undergo normal checks trials. There's reason drugs normally undergo process.

How take first wave vaccine get immunity tester experienced serious injury 6 months year I'll take it? Yep, outbreak Melbourne another ploy discredit Trump. going say racist, thought taking far. guys you’re also wearing masks.

I suggest begin easier option. curious, constantly everyday posting negative news Sweden? agenda? agree Sweden managed pandemic correctly, crusade posting negatives instead learning mistakes show positive trends? mean, really helping sowing distrust negative views. Unfortunately, yeah said drunk driving, would agreed. different know it. Yes 25% population voted really know anything president does. wheel. There's one minding store. still know vote again.

I think Sweden kinda wanted Korea Europe - keep everything open, including border instead suppressing (not eradication) virus order keep everything open, opted building immunity blew faces reputation went toilet.. *really* got stop treating politics like reality TV show. made silk mask. 2 layers, surprisingly difficult breathe through! Incest. No. thought lol XD funny asking sex. Fuck government, fuck idiot citizens, fuck president. yet surge goes know say, ""Everything dumber Texas!"" 

Wait. Note world, passes 'leadership' America.

I ashamed backassward, anti-science, anti-knowledge, hateful, prideful, arrogant, idiotic tribal society everything, every subject including public health turned political football used crave divide nation.

With leaders like fool helm America doomed. wait fall college starts up. Covid already exploding still leaders sit hands nothing stop it. Hell, policy makers sent back work, tell us ""safer home."" work safe.

Policy makers emphasized young people die much, perhaps way us stomach sending youth hazardous conditions meager pay. guy said senior Texans would gladly die economy?

Cuz he’s actually making guys prove point. That’s fair actually think it’s much much older. 5000 years old - back literal creation Adam Eve.

On side note - never checked actually started humans race....I thought two sons? not. 2 weeks herd immunity!!! #Translation:

#The Nurses' Association Frp's health policy spokesperson believe health tests introduced incoming health workers two Swedish health personnel substitutes tested positive coronavirus.

On Saturday, Nordfjord Hospital reports Swedish substitute doctor tested positive coronavirus receiving quarantine exemption. addition, Swedish temporary nurse Sandnessjøen hospital infected.

- completely incredible. Health Minister Bent Høie demanded health personnel come countries must undergo health test work here, says health policy spokesperson Frp Åshild Bruun-Gundersen.

The physician Nordfjord Hospital began symptoms Thursday tested positive Friday. person supposed arrived Norway last weekend granted quarantine exemption work.

On Thursday, began symptoms, stayed away work. person tested positive Friday, worked two days hospital.

- emergency room doctor underwent infection mapping usual way prior work. person granted quarantine exemption, criteria met, Hunskår Vingsnes tells VG.

It uncertain whether temporary nurse Sandnessjøen Hospital quarantine Norway started working.

Bruun-Gundersen looks concern two cases past week.

- enough say symptom-free. expose Norwegian inhabitants danger spared.

#-Absolutely indefensible

Bruun-Gundersen urges Høie introduce duty foreign workers soon possible health examination work Norwegian health care system.

- introduced connection detection tuberculosis year ago, cannot understand requirement apply coronavirus pandemic. 

The FRP politician points high infection rates Sweden, believes exception Swedes. 

- Patients Norway afraid go Norwegian hospitals risk exposed infection there, says Bruun-Gundersen.

County Manager Nursing Association Nordland Gjertrud Krokaa responded practice late March.

- severe restrictions elsewhere country. totally unjustifiable quarantine temps, says Krokaa.


**COUNCIL LEADER:** - critically important nurses contact patients comply quarantine regulations grant exceptions, Gjertrud H. Krokaa said back March. Photo: Norwegian Nursing Association

She understands substitutes quarantined notice symptoms.

- people work sick vulnerable people, susceptible infection. Exposing patients colleagues help.

Krokaa believes unethical hire temporary workers Norway country needs health professionals. 

- That's acceptable. unable clean staffing situation country, instead spend lot money hiring temporary workers. says bit desperate situation is, brings country high rates infection.

- Bent Høie government must look use this, says further.

VG contact Ministry Health, received answer far. No, mandated places people option use (like public transportation).

Places like bars.... don't, let patron decide. cats bag.... refuse refuse anyway. job protect can't protect themselves. It’s baffling. People never learned think critically ability learn correctly using valid sources. become parrots unsourced conspiracy theories thinks world persecute them. I've literally ask one customer ""what trying accomplish here? want cry, driving at? makes feel better."" Karen called store confirm fired received gift card,” wrote Kaye.

And this, ladies gentlemen, many people ""Karens"". gets results.

Hopefully goes viral Coldstone's PR gets nice black eye... issue civilized world though. USA developed country completely unable flatten curve. Americans insanely selfish.  release US already, prob much safer got going right several months multiple southern states going death fridges parked front hospitals. presidential election held mail. Look: Kids suck. 3. tell much time. humans. hear understand many times act like little shits become annoying.

But kids wonderful overall. People really need butch-up-Sally shut up, put heads down, deal shitty bosses shitty behavior kids.

I sympathy folks complain. wife basically longer schedule ANYTHING anymore.

We get up, one goes work, one stays, flip, yell kids, type passive-aggressive emails boss, keep balls juggling best can. Owners, sure...their staff? No. title misleading. Italy able test nearly amount population Texas able test. close dying, getting test. Texas, pretty much ""You got symptoms? wanna know? Get line!"". picks much larger number cases. could see actual number cases Italy vs actual number cases TX, close same, daily cumulative.  Eek punchable face We're close doubling reported positives compared two weeks ago. next days likely 50k + test results tend reported later week. positives we're seeing right already time spread virus, see effect spread next two weeks regardless new closings / mask orders put place. Whether gets us 100k per day soon yet seen, we're still going bit start see shift back down. saw NY/NJ start spike late March took month substantial decline, much stricter lockdown measures state willing put place again. don’t really agree you. Steve jobs known ass hole. Trump made president ass hole massive followings. may turn people I’d surprised numbers didn’t keep going up. don’t know he’d bring down. top brass get away everything. That's pretty messed up. Ah, July flu. Always worst flu season. Trump: Law&amp;Order! lost much respect Elon that. record, title misleading. Italy able test nearly amount population Texas able test. close dying, getting test. Texas, pretty much ""You got symptoms? wanna know? Get line!"". picks much larger number cases. could see actual number cases Italy vs actual number cases TX, close same, daily cumulative. Yeah, that’s wear mask everywhere. know lot people won’t, I’ve working diet taking vitamin supplements. 

I also understand people heightened risk factor. I’m asking can’t go work, *don’t* heightened risk factor. can't wait stock pump fuck legal? Fuck em. Stay strong! FreeDumb want to, can't help agree ""but long operating within legal bounds policymakers catch flack.""

The people still blame degree, personal responsibility fellow humans all, pragmatic side also recognizes people regulated, sometimes force right thing. Remember end February, beginning march seeing fucking scary shit coming italy. clear hitting us scary. 


Now apparently bored back business usual response 
Welp. That’s pretty much I’d heard it’s good see spelled fairly short article. Walleberg adult room, pushed Test, Trace, Isolate (TTI), got frustrated quit ended scapegoat systemic failure. 

Another thing confirmed part problem lack staff. 

Well look like despite Wallberg’s early departure, efforts move towards TTI creaking ever slowly ahead end. All’s well ends well…Except it’s really yet. Oh many people died probably didn’t TTI infrastructure set earlier.

I used lot faith Sweden could pull stuff like now, months bungling, feel like wait tenterhooks see it’ll happen. Testing increasing positive indicator, several major snafus it, worst situation Gothenburg staff pushed past breaking point. WHAT? Childrens salute flag school US? Living 30 minutes Tennessee/Virginia state line honestly scary. many people come areas seen spike cases. Stay MA! definitely think national holiday. IK working 40 hours/week sucks trying cram lunch wake several hours early so. 2016 managed squeeze lunch, though POC face much difficult systemic challenges. 

Unfortunately sometimes choose lesser 2 evils. I'm huge fan Hilary, sure country would look like her, IK would've 100x competent bumbling racist pond scum brain president now. WrestleMania 23 Look - hope good too, there's barely data here. There's even approved ph2/3 study.  interviews people COVID experiencing now, months later.

It's interesting *arent* kind videos YouTube, right?

Considering many people recovered Covid, would expect tons suffering permanent effects.

They iPhone. YouTube right there.

""Life Covid"".

But arent many videos like all.

I wonder why? That's point, restaurants, casinos, retail allowed stay open, can't gyms? Ducey literally save face. truly wanted slow spread, would close EVERYTHING non-essential. Wrong. Fauci admitted explicitly told American people masks help shortage masks wanted make sure enough medical personnel. reversed course mask shortage relieved. Fauci record that. it’s central eastern Washington problem. One big agricultural counties main culprit. lot essential migrant workers can’t social distance mixed MAGA cult types refuse wear masks. frustrating is, makes ends would happening there. parent can't teach child read write something fundamentally wrong.  going online only. may declare yet, want enrollment changing online, going mostly online f2f special programs (like med/law).

There idiotic greedy schools sure, think gonna online fall majority students. “Not total control”? Titanic also totally afloat. Sure I'll quit job, lose house, go live street beg money stay children, either keep job pay $2k month per kid go school's daycare program.

Problem wife work full time. kids school something comes cost. school start I'm impasse pay money, top school taxes literally go waste, stretch budget thin. 

Must nice privilege keep kids home. ""Fuck ears, I'm panderin'"" ""That's impossible, I'm control here."" - Nation lost control.  sub unbelievable sometimes.

What's punctuation? periods attached first letter next sentence. *There coronavirus Ba Sing Se* Reddit addiction phone number? patios hiding rock? I’m sure insurance cost many times amount lol completely ridiculous. People refusing wear face masks stupid beyond repair. second outbreak cost hundreds billions dollars many lives. Japan didn’t quarantine forced everyone wear face masks. they’re Covid free. Since apparently one reading article...

I really don‘t know could think confirms claims. (meaning institute virology) claim confirmed covid fact originated bats (having ACE2 receptor spike).

If could, would laws all.

By targeting ""young adults"" source problems giving pass ones really causing recent spike. 

The responsibility lie state federal policymakers. Period.

Sweden really failed pretty much vulnerable groups disastrous strategy. Similar. lost 75% (about US$3000) cruise trip scheduled late February-early March Singapore-Hong Hong. told still going despite COVID. There’s way boat sailing knew it.

I cancelled right 100% penality deadline. 36 hours later, right deadline (and non-Asia-based passengers would already airplane flying get Singapore get ship), announced cruise cancelled - refunds, full credit towards future trip. 

Out curiosity asked policy would apply since record cancelled due Covid risk. said no. Frankly I’d rather 25% back since knows company survive. 

Singapore Air issued full refund immediately. Singapore hotel refunded complained enough. Hong Kong hotel didn’t. feel you! I’m thing. Also completely right. monty python satire world live in... already huge shortage viable organs donations; would increase issue. Always love law stop every single crime law exist argument. Whacked libertardian thinking.  Greedy people manipulate ignorant people. basically motto human society.  People fucking love lied to. Especially Americans. Especially Trumptrash. article mentions 32 materials tested. Anybody access test results? feel like people know potential dangers coronavirus. don’t see harm allowing people choose open/go bars desire. you’re elderly, I’d personally recommend stay home. you’re young healthy coronavirus nothing, fucking night out. “Sorry bit cough won’t stay long”
“Aaah yeah allergies pretty bad too”
“Actually coronavirus thing. BTW finish bio homework? I’m trouble figuring Pee-neoomonia is.” everyone lying... one sees clearly... others wake up... 

I say one sees clearly say others wake up. Please read post carefully, little bro ;)

Also would nice could stop coming blatant lies ;) someone makes fun wearing mask reply saying ""no ok wash hands make mask. borrow pen?"" See quickly people's mind change. Nearly long confederacy... Ah make sense, realize much lag. absolutely disgusting unreal.  live MA, Boston everyone wearing mask, city Lowell 50% people are, get control wearing mask months. idiotic let go on. word things mitigate bad things happening. 

Pre-doing something like that. /s people realize oven hot touch rack themselves. — Lyndon B.

Sweet home alabamy propaganda targeting young adults, far saw older karens establishments refusing masks went out, indoors arguably worse thing going beach spring break something due recycled air Try harder basically brother since beginning. wear mask required store, lives life completely normally anything differently infuriating. I've tried countless times get wear one, response ""I really care"" People going people shit. know many health care workers going vacation, wearing masks, going parties?

This opening poses problems.

People notoriously bad risk analysis. unless grand plans train everyone instantly become better, going badger new perspective.

You cannot treat global problem individual solutions mandates.

It help, sure, certain point treating cancer vitamin therapy. Instead getting mad vitamins miraculous, mad spent seven months bumbling response reopening prematurely donor class worried million dollar bonuses. That’s happens gather large groups. Stop hurting SpaceX burns money even Tesla Starlink DoA. No, plenty books, courses taken, personal experiences say education great long you’re rich. you’re education don’t know shit. 

My personal anecdote wife submitted 2300 dollars receipts year supplies classroom lacked. go on. I'll honest, I'm skimming nonsense...I gave small benefit doubt assumed sane talking comparable countries (since ""poorer countries"" every country planet): Germany, France, Spain, Italy, UK, China, SK, Japan, Vietnam, etc. 

NZ great job...but totally unrealistic majority countries states.

You're comparing country fewer 5 million people literally **an island** state 40 million people world's 5th largest economy. LA alone 4 million people. **Alabama** higher GDP NZ ffs.

I feel like disconnect comprehension logistics scale. basically saying ""well nana makes best Thanksgiving ever 10 people...why can't solve world hunger?""

OK, seriously...done 😂 nice life. bullshit rule. hell wrong mods? novelty subreddit. way take politics could happened? could seen coming? expect whole lot Biden presidency return ""normal status quo"" period time (hopefully) nationwide introspection happened last decade.

Why would anything want anyone read? majority Swedish articles getting posted decent quality. posted discuss topic itself, rather platform misinformation. that's another problem.

What bother articles butchered translation, poster ignores feedback runs narrative instead removing posting article contacting mod. OK I’ve worked math found work minimum wage 30 hours week, better working full time $20/hr benefits. medications alone would run $1600/month, Decent health insurance would run least $600+$copay+$deductible.

It's entitlement mentality. boils care cause I'm good. could please protest way inconvenience me, we're good.

The whole point protest disruption. change status quo asking nicely. definitely uber, that's nothing think healthy. Shit. saying mods it? saying don’t time fact check? 9/11 different?

It first time attacked since 1800s foreign national soil. Somehow us killing terrorists, you, ""messing middle east"". pathetic. 

You're pretending money. not. might rights, rights Americans. continued existence. Yes. That's big part probably. 

Honestly, government needs step in. need support citizens order slow shit down. (It'll never happen though. Shutdowns happening disasters without federal aid.) bullshit. Shipping lanes defend pirates, Russia generally leave Eastern Europe alone they're really nice guys definitely want become superpower again. US definitely fucked corona could use criminal justice reform, crap Europeans blame US either willful ignorance part directly subsidized US. Defense spending? Heavily subsidized US. Racism? Netherlands literally slave christmas majority country sees absolutely nothing wrong that, that's mention general Romanian sentiment EU/Germany's tiny major neo-nazi problem. Obviously US gains lot subsidizing defense spending rest world, stupid pretend US that. serious. Side affects....I'll pass Ah, they're experts then. Experts implies already expert knowledge subject. Um...have see absolute garbage floating cesspool country? course Americans ashamed. Lying self driving capabilities selling people pretty damn fraudulent.

Also there's well documented warranty reserve fraud going on. last time kept wrong translation 

So? saying rather poor translation stands own, rather side side people compare?

Once again, come across someone trying suppress information, add opinion it’s coincidence

That sounds like ""conspiracy theory""... Wait stocked 70% world's PPE still counts ""downplaying""? evidence correlation reopening, evidence correlation protests. actually understand means? They're comparing infection graphs cities re-opened versus didn't, also cities large protests versus didn't, one shows positive correlation doesn't. 

That's conclusions drawn, counting days since X thing occurred sayng, ""Well closer present obviously responsible present."" are. Us even top 5 worst countries per capita. virus still spreading countries like US. Perhaps biggest country world downside containing virus? Might choice that. Man bought corolla hatchback last year.. blue flame spoiler tinted windows nice rims all. joke get compliments time it! also.. hell taking recess WEEKS pandemic economic crisis?! hell going here? Wow. kind says everything Sweden's abject failure protect vulnerable groups. 

 says Sweden, says thing practically every country world high levels racial minorities... happened UK, Greece, Italy, USA, etc - places long-standing systemic health social inequities put members racial ethnic minority groups increased risk getting COVID-19 experiencing severe illness, regardless age. 

All problems directly connected food exercise access to, level education, employment, housing, healthcare, economic political power within communities.

Yes speculate coronavirus caused deaths evidence it. understand difference? worked 15 years retail. learned pretty quick even follow policies customer throws temper tantrum still gets want calling corporate get trouble. came demanding wanted blah blah blah. made happen. reason quote company policy call, get wanted anyway get trouble.

You really live bubble

We see worst- suffered half million identified deaths globally already 2 billions doses ready ship confirmed vaccine safe. biggest european countries get doses first together USA brazil.


From i've heard, mass inoculations shouldnt take long. dutch population wil vaccinated matter weeks Trump deploying army mass vaccinate.

Its going typical' go local hospital get shot type deal' 

In atleast netherlands, goverment uses congress buildings football stadiums every city mass vaccinate. Best compliment ever recieved mistaken Canadian traveling Europe. significant long term illness

Do wash hands touching equipment? use limited amount equipment there's less traffic? scientific data points reduced viral transmission outdoors contradicts earlier advice, loophole. data driven proof initial model falsified newer study. 

If prove give evidence support position, I'd like see it.

Time start taking action February March. July. tech (state employee). Unemployment would takehome. Given Italy gotten pandemic control, good news Arizona, guess? cannot understand people. me... reason would giant spike deaths pandemic? think coincidence 20% increase deaths, pandemic, even though people quarantining staying inside? need perform autopsies see gigantic red flag. America, go court house call justice peace come house marry us legally, even without wedding. India something similar? asshole. both? many restaurants Manhattan parking lots? garbage. scientific studies done terribly small time frame. None contradict other, add discoveries sometimes change narrative Yup, they'll redo worked first time around again, everyone catch it. wear freaking mask No, it’s things reported. adaptive immune system always antibodies T-Cells. Yup. Chain not, great take demand nice outdoor eating area, fucked. would say locking essential.

But, yeah, people definitely wearing masks. Yup. would trust better job public school system already struggles enough money. Yes numbers make sense. trying assert outdoor protests *just dangerous as* indoor activities recirculating air. However protest response police large places like LA ended masses protesters arrested, loaded busses left sometimes hours end stuck confined spaces packed like sardines.  People beaten, screaming, bloody, touched grabbed protesters trying rescue them..  people factoring details comes this, kind infuriating see blanket statements used over, every single region US handled virus response differently. ""United"" countries name mean true. Okay, let give hand.

At bars, people drink alcohol. restaurants, people eat food. notably difficult eat food drink alcohol face covered mask. Therefore, people wear masks using bars restaurants intended purpose.

At grocery stores, people grab groceries, buy them, leave. *Most* people eat drink things shopping grocery store. Therefore, possible use grocery store intended purpose - buying groceries - wearing mask.

You still trouble grasping this? Gotta wonder y'all get dressed morning. I'm Turkey, country one last countries get likely.

Mexican-American, think funny watch!  
\*laughs Mexican-American\* Agreed. general take serology testing - aside inherent testing flaws built actual test (false positives) - inclusion criteria tend skew results toward positive. 

Examples: asking people entrance CVS want tested (this happened NYC): get people way cough medicine, people about, people make multiple trips shopping likely captured people making one trip month. miss people completely sheltering home. 

Example 2: north LA: putting PSA “if want serology testing come here!” skews toward people symptoms 2 months ago want know covid.

Example 3: (like hospital): internal testing: mentioned before, captures patients, staff (surrounded covid patients essential employees interacting others since began - personally exposed US citizen patients February brought back Wuhan eventually tested positive negative serology last month)). skews toward positive too.

So remember, TRUE population positive 1.5% (0.015x3.3M population county=49.5k actual) test gets rate 3% (99k presumed), IFR look like 0.37% it’s actually 0.74% (using 365 deaths) little changes make big difference multiplying big numbers. flaws methodology inclusion criteria testing probably lead MUCH larger discrepancies

Edit: also note, hospital doesn’t serve community within county hit hardest thus far, falsely elevating calculation IFR, falsely LOWERING calculation IFR fact many patients captured week ago (so they’d IgG positive) eventually die yet died. it’s estimates upon estimates upon estimates Little surprise honestly. Based reading I’ve done virus last months, seems like, surprisingly, transmission requires conditions:

1. indoors

2. mask infected person

3. within 6 feet infected person

4. close contact needs last least minutes perhaps longer infected person coughing, talking, singing, anything would accelerate respiratory droplet production.

Brain grid

Of novel coronaviruses’s manifestations, impact brain among vexing. Patients reported host neurological impairments including reduced ability smell taste, altered mental status, stroke, seizures — even delirium.

An early study China, published BMJ, formerly British Medical Journal, March, found 22 percent 113 patients experienced neurological issues ranging excessive sleepiness coma — conditions typically grouped together disorders consciousness. June, researchers France reported 84 percent patients intensive care neurological issues, third confused disoriented discharge. Also month, United Kingdom found 57 125 coronavirus patients new neurological psychiatric diagnosis stroke due blood clot brain, 39 altered mental state.

Based data anecdotal reports, Isaac Solomon, neuropathologist Brigham Women’s Hospital Boston, set systematically investigate virus might embedding brain. conducted autopsies 18 consecutive deaths, taking slices key areas: cerebral cortex (the gray matter responsible information processing), thalamus (modulates sensory inputs), basal ganglia (responsible motor control) others. divided three-dimensional grid. Ten sections taken studied.

He found snippets virus areas, unclear whether dead remnants, active virus patient died. small pockets inflammation. large swaths damage due oxygen deprivation. Whether deceased longtime intensive care patients, people died suddenly, Solomon said, pattern eerily similar.

“We surprised,” said.
When brain get enough oxygen, individual neurons die death permanent. certain extent, people’s brains compensate point, damage extensive different functions start degrade.

On practical level, Solomon said virus getting brain large amounts, helps drug development treatment becomes trickier pervasive, instance, patients West Nile HIV. 

Another takeaway findings underscore importance getting people supplementary oxygen quickly prevent irreversible damage.

Solomon, whose work published June 12 letter New England Journal Medicine, said findings suggest damage happening longer period time, make wonder virus’s effect people less ill. “The big lingering question happens people survive covid,” said. “Is lingering effect brain?”

The team Mount Sinai Health, took tissue findings 20 brains, also perplexed find lot virus inflammation. However, group noted paper widespread presence tiny clots “striking.”

“If one blood clot brain, see time. we’re seeing patients multiple strokes blood vessels two even three different territories,” Fowkes said.

Rapkiewicz said early know whether newest batch autopsy findings translated treatment changes, information opened new avenues explore. One first calls noticing unusual platelet-producing cells Jeffrey Berger, cardiac specialist NYU runs National Institutes Health-funded lab focuses platelets.

Berger said autopsies suggest anti-platelet medications, addition blood thinners, may helpful stem effects covid-19. pivoted major clinical trial looking optimal doses 38 look question well.

“It’s one piece big puzzle, lot learn,” said. “But prevent significant complications patients survive infection, changes everything.”  year hold beer ""Not many people want work""

Because that’s person responded clearly referring to. 

“Duddits” character book important note article addresses *mortality burden* pandemic, seek count number deaths caused via infection virus. Deaths resulting infection may significantly higher mortality burden discussed article, causes death - like traffic accidents, incidence - may dropped due response pandemic overall circumstances created. Deaths infection could also significantly lower, circumstances pandemic raised deaths - people declining seek care ailments, instance, increased OD's suicides.

So general conclusion impact virus mortality. fine grained analysis deaths caused infection may possible, certain causes death like car accidents, suicides drug OD's accounted for, research attempt kind analysis.  I'd happy get multiple shots year safe make people care (and strangers well) can't get vaccinated safe someone make safe longer lasting vaccine. doubt problem.

True heroes! guy runs business central Stockholm, tell first hand tourists traveling Sweden. think exclusively restrictions stopping people, restrictions stop even people want to. One little dash orange Eastern Shore MD.... assume chicken factory outbreak... Cuz much else area IMHO mistakes even honest easy make mistakes.

The first mistake dates back january. order prevent virus arrive italy government banned flights china. asked EU EU refused. Instead planning different strategy went ban. created situation control. People could land frankfurt (for example) fly milan. government heavily attacked strategy outbreaks discovered. defence big mistake EU behavior.

The second mistake adjust testing procedures. testing procedures required person Hubei province lost control people coming in, could extended testing compatibile symptoms. since time testing capabilities limited everywhere peak flu season waste testing people probably flu (millions italians catch flu every year) might smart idea. mistake sure clear alternative. addition chinese couple positive came visit cities including rome government contact traced prevented outbreak. think made feel like right thing keep testing people contacts chinese. unaware virus spreading course first confirmed local infection feb 22nd.

The third mistake organization healthcare system lombardy. Every region power organize system lombardy system made big hospitals. made spread different areas easier power lombardy HC system, big centers perform kind surgery amd treatment, turned biggest weakness hospitals became outbreaks. result planning organization healthcare lombardy least decade. like saying federal organization US work well pandemic central state controls everything easier way handle this. might true change possible.

The real mistake quarantine immediately larger area. locking whole country waited 17 days. saved rest country lombardy late. quarantined bergamo areas way before. honest judges actually investigating central government also regional government could done that. case responsibility split. addition found virus black waters samples DECEMBER. confirmed point impossible stop. Almost another variable could cause impact ! say ""social distance wear masks""- sure dont mean ""have margarita made mouth Senor Frogs lick every doorknob county""?

Yeah positive rate really looking at, hospitalizations deaths. mean deaths go hopefully action taken ramp testing. I'd surprised even knows Toronto is, larger nearly major US cities. *Taps forehead*

Can't second wave first wave end. value added tax 10% would raise 1.2 trillion dollars annually. first stimulus package 2 trillion dollars. extreme time also definite end it. Even VAT implemented year even cover first portion stimulus package arguing even larger second stimulus package. limits realistically done. give everyone million dollars money would mean nothing anymore.

But let's take example mean. One post today report describing differences mortality. positive article tries explain going on.

The posters comment? goes usual style:
""Wow. kind says everything Sweden's abject failure protect vulnerable groups.""

A better comment would been:
""Wow, beginning explanation high mortality groups"" FL (among states) appears vastly underreporting deaths throughout pandemic. death rate per 1M population completely proportion rest country. They've reported 4,200 deaths pneumonia compared roughly 900 period five prior years. original almost identical spreadsheet I've tracking everything :)

Yeah, noticed huge increase discharges also thought big jump probably due simply people recovering. Indian wedding celebrations last days. Nothing Bragg about...... I’ll see Cuz freedom nationwide nadir particularly important what’s going South West now? early June, increases Texas, Florida, etc... canceled decreases Northeast - cases South West started sharp increase last week May. late May mid June part spike entirely driven testing? 

It’s interesting look cases deaths curve New York side side, look (with 7 day lag). isn’t true Georgia, Florida, California, etc.. know lot good testing capacity didn’t New York outbreak, plus potentially continuing data lag.. wonder much explained different patient characteristics, better treatments, even change virus (I understand pretty unlikely, also know something scientists least considering). 

It seem like situation Arizona markedly concerning right Florida, Texas, California, etc. would minorities less access dental care? dentists really racist? Live TX, people see wear masks practice social distancing.

I see Texas roughly 5% deaths per capita NY NJ. realize different population densities, TX still shows one best states live in, regard coronavirus mortality still everyone beating state.

I'm saying Texas done perfectly, see 0 recognition good stuff state done seems really partisan. Cool. must put lot work community. Thank you. one claimed 20%, someobe else jumped in.

If resources used COVID patients, there's none left people come gunshot wounds, appendicitis, injuries falls, heart attacks - everything hospital normally takes care of. 

Gods help us one cities outbreak also mass shooting, plane crash, natural disaster kind. use Axe Body Spray. Lol... that’s “plan” pandemic dealing deadly virus? 

... exactly many parents aren’t rush. mean community acquired pneumonia always bulk pneumonia cases. Strep pneumo H. influenzae pneumonia possibly kill older person get treated. hospitals even outpatient doctors offices avoided en masse. confounding variables make excess pneumonia death numbers difficult interpret.

Maybe we're atypical hospital testing everyone get since April. Elecive surgeries going since May. time I've ever tell people yes, absolutely stay chest pain elevated troponins. level hospital phobia I've never seen hesitate put historical context. I'm statistician though. second KN95 useless. N95 type masks provide much protection unless forms good seal face, material dense, even small gaps would result lot leak. N95 fit test home worried it, instruction videos YouTube, good hospital fit test better fit test all. similar thing happen got swine flu regular flu time. Shortly got shingles (in 30s), got Bell’s Palsy, wound hospital liver failure able somehow stop high doses IV NAC (they normally use Tylenol OD). I’ve got Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Fibromyalgia side chronic anemia doctors can’t figure out. I’ve quarantined home since March, I’ll go absolutely to. You’re right people don’t want hear them. real mask.

Leave N95s medical professionals. They're closer contact rest us. bad taking word. pretty sure Ford also history racism sexism employment doesn’t mean wrongful termination doesn’t exist. still follow laws rules such, you’d able fire someone didn’t like color skin.

In case employee faithfully executing company policy following state mandate fired action.

At point you’d need convince jury employer wrongfully terminated them, win case.

Given overriding hate company receiving this, doesn’t seem like much stretch. Maybe extra filtration, see problems doubling kn95 terms proper fit, donning doffing routine importantly, able breathe. make difficult breathe, you’re likely wear wrong.

However, read months ago [wearing pantyhose helps improve mask fit. Also, people layer surgical mask k/n95. 

I’ve also found get better seal kn95s pull earloops tighter behind head. use ribbon bunch ideas reduce ear irritation might also options. deaths? Texas Arizona wider gaps, roughly 55% 53%, respectively, excess deaths unattributed Covid-19

surprise, surprise New Yorker here, think need shut streets open space restaurants operate outdoors.

I think we'll ready indoor dining anytime soon, restaurants workers really killed this.

Even open indoor dining people go, embrace outdoor thing more. terminated last week. Terrified current market. least i'm alone course is. biggest problem people aware need told surprised, people aware fervently believe true cannot convinced otherwise. That's you. family make decision. I've personally seen family 2x see weekend. working home feel relatively healthy high risk. Mental health big concern people dont want go months without seeing loved ones. deaths everyone loves talk low theyve creeping Plus, many money stock market retirement accounts access many years. market recovery really impact much since market see many increases decreases retire start accessing funds. article nothing innate immune response. Pediatrician offices sure are. Thanks Murica. Maybe they’re better way dispense necessary PPE citizenry vending machine.

It's fairly solid method situation. Subway stations daily fact life almost New Yorkers. easily accessible. prices fair, burdensome, keep people stockpiling. point contact another person, sales clerk etc, might vector. risk machine itself. concerned buy hand sanitizer and/or gloves. machine. self driving cars. Surely find efficient way get PPE hands people need it.

Maybe? Nothing perfect, good. Good works. numbers delayed...I took test last Tuesday showing symptoms still received results 8 days later labs backed live NH town nursing home become hotspot recently. 

Local people always saying ""but nursing home"" numbers come out. realizing people work also generally live town. spread rebound this. That's hope, effectiveness results yet - they? Finally standard quality that’s using “Made America” Jokes him, I've already locked mine cupboard. That's fair.

To me, read science denying though, questioning. That's entire part scientific method, lot people running kind fast loose information regarding Covid, labeling science (out necessity understand).

I still believe labeling someone forefront scientific development multiple arenas science denying pretty misleading. saw numbers texted coronavirus chat friend with: ""Arizona fucked."" start see deaths coming later week next due death lag. I'm thinking may see 5k/day peak. seeing videos hallways like China start. know plenty individuals still wear mask ""back March, said need to"" reason, cannot change stance light new evidence political scientific leaders constantly stating wear mask. However, I've come realize individuals merely using science political statements justify refuse wear mask well. want wear mask, justification, matter outdated unscientific, do. invariably creates confusion two individuals -masker no-masker- provide conflicting information supposed source without context.

There's also large issue people look towards politicians speak absolute terms rather scientific uncertainty. hear one misguided opinion brain-dead politician speaks absolutes, they've cemented views whole fiasco forever. However, new virus scenario, there's lot uncertainty shifting information must taken account.

Some seem view failure science, rather nature scientific process itself. Science never complete 100% accurate answer, ""best observed fitting"" answer subject change. vapid statement /r/RepublicofNE death young man top post sub? swear people utterly obsessed promoting nothing bad news pandemic. Dan Patrick taking Laura Ingram anyone knowing talking literally definition irony. I'm confused point?

That extremely dangerous reckless car manufacturing companies operating right now, demanding people die make fucking car absurd?  Expand takeout delivery. Seems fairly reasonable house dining open cuts labor overhead half. almost started restaurant I'm tempted get ball rolling lender right now. One biggest problems house dining original plan rise incivility across US downright shitty customers waste time drain staff. I'm make great food, fuck around dealing Karen's day. They've gone dime dozen least day, without fail let's face it, best best going restaurants right anyway while. pandemic actually opens possibility maneuver around waste time guests, focus actual business improving quality delivered products marketing pandemic. 

TL;DR Overhead savings front cover net losses house dining left needs go toward marketing, expansion payroll loyal staff, delivered product improvement. /r/RepublicofNE people told us masks don’t work back suddenly whine warned. We’ve scarves bandanas centuries. privileged sure appear rather well off. touch reality fellow Americans. Trump administration definitely investigate CDC

How tax cuts multi-millionaires round golf? not.

I also think ever tested.

Most hospitals mandatory testing symptomatic. think absurd open bars dine beaches, act horrified young people go places dont follow rules, knew society rely everyone right thing. Bars closed hands down, govt needs help bars thing untill over. hand forced im sure majority would rather serving drunk mouth breathers right now, want support staff options point. leadership failed continues deflect blame young people. outside problem ""young people going out"", experience working restaurant whole time, older conservative folks combative reckless new health procedures. Young people tend wear mask respect rules, older folks want debate whos constitutional rights infringed. also see problem span enitre age group work, young people. general see young adults dont mask misinformed mixed messaging, dont think risk, ect ect. Older people know masks work, dont wear defiance. Usually younger person comes window without mask tell need one, almost alway spaced forgot car, older people proceed tell im sheep, muh rights, bla bla bla. Seems pretty simple me, dont want young people go out? Well stop opening things shouldnt open, support people cant work. forcing young people back work, yelling us it. talking about. Corporations people friend. OK, respect opinion. Americans continue celebrate 4th regardless. Florida run people moral compass

So one particular party can't name due auto-filter? Many jobs lost aren’t coming back, slow return. UBI acts incentive find new work, whereas unemployment disincentive. I’d keep UBI bit longer pandemic reason. Everyone reads also thinks they’re top 50% too. Yeah, now’s best time. Oh no! must convince you... hope day get shame.

Hey look, did! emoji lol 

💀 really depends are. upper 20%, US 1st world country --- you. think would many dead case. spreading NY Washington unnoticed weeks
And maybe couple months. Free? America? without massive pressure public law makers public's side. Comparing hotspot compared current hotspot bad data comparison. Remember death 3 week lagging indicator. Meaning change done limit infections hit death another 3 weeks. Infections creeping past new York new York already lockdown measures. investigate comment 3 weeks Texas finally takes seriously. don’t know; disinfectant wipes still hard come places, might success machines. Also, rest country explodes cases, getting masks local Duane Reade online Amazon might prove challenging. It’s nice city proactively though back-up options. ""“Fauci said today he’s concerned states like Texas ‘skipped over’ certain things. doesn’t know he’s talking about,” Patrick told Fox News host Laura Ingraham interview. “We haven’t skipped anything. thing I’m skipping listening him.”


Well explains numbers lack humanity disturbing.

But even putting aside : 20 years ago, 3000 americans killed 9/11. event seemed traumatic US ? reminding every possible moment, messed middle east tremendously hissy fit ?

3 000 lives vs possible 500 000, 1 000 000.

Personally would sacrifice entire economy save wife, preexisting conditions, I'm sad seem one life would important money. I'm sorry. helps any, feel way sometimes well. take one day time. get this.

Are working physically somewhere, home? Yeah, I’ve heard mental help one well. Well, see spike NYC next two weeks, protests. Can't blame bars Restaurants, reddit. You’ll get downvoted falling line general sentiment around here, you’re right. Hate admit sticky situation US population figure lockdown cannot happen again. prove question good intentions want know motives agenda posting links comments? ""karma whoring"" typical trolling. amount energy time put posting commenting, me, interesting. course, could assume troll, agent outside influence Sweden, part opposition etc. seems not.

Hey guys. live Texas (unfortunately). husband recently exposed COVID secretary works closely. home quarantine tested 6:00 morning. started coughing I'm worried. 

My husband called GP see could get test too, told 9:00 today, testing done county. 

I super freaked texas stopping testing make numbers look better. really worries me. anyone thoughts this? hope right. tend ""project"" behavior witness, assuming wearing mask walking tight trail, probably wearing one dangerous situations. I'll calm now. Maybe give away free, one per person scan subway card something. Yeah lol thats whole issue Good thing ""doubts"" happen, feel relieved.  No, really. behaviour 100% normal FOUR-YEAR OLD.

You can't expect sound reasoning child. children grow it. Hell, even lot do. also think reasoning deeply flawed comparing cognitive skills 4-year old teenager adult. Celebrating freedoms wearing masks, eating restaurants congregating large groups. /s It’s number 7.5: right get swole. reads like propaganda. even legit site? People forget need human experts manage this. nice new hospitals useless without actual essentials fucking workers last time checked nurses doctors also danger getting sick dieing..


But hey cares lives?! /s Fuck people value hardships. conundrum group deserve treated tools. premise incorrect. Nationally, US cases bottomed week June 8th, 3 weeks ago.

Ok, hate government response much do, case isn’t death sentence, let’s lose perspective here. 

In fact, death rate gone drastically since reopenings widespread testing. Please don’t scare people unnecessarily. Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance. Don’t believe second. posting one trolliest comments history Reddit, doubt kids. I'm thinking like Victoria Vancouver since grew Seattle Pacific Northwest cities less identical.

Wise choice. Living Seattle Vancouver before, would say Vancouver nicer version Seattle. Thank you! Why? why? Idk still can't like said got sick march 14th mom stage 4 colon cancer basically like cant get coronavirus thing need tested know precautions take. flu test came back negative chest x ray told pneumonia remember asking ""could covid thing?"" nurse said ""Maybe.... make sure stop reception make sure billing information correct"", walked away realize won’t ... desperate control narrative . 
All deaths preventable . 
Some charlatans held criminally liable . checked something like 7000 Americans die day. even 700 people dead day Coronavirus pretty nuts. 10% normal deaths entirely new pandemic that's pandemic lowest? Yikes. Different areas, guess. I'm southwest Ohio lot folks work around here. I've heard vaccine viable virus already mutating, would get different vaccine yearly like flu.

Is true?

Also, nurses told fastest vaccine created 8 years 20 years research behind it, vaccine long time, so, recommend limited testing .

Just kinda wanna get smarter people's thoughts this.. He's technically right. didnt skip anything didnt anything begin with. 🤷‍♂️ Please, Oxford! one! Seriously why? Capital Region going phase 4 tomorrow signs spike.  People never gonna wear masks religiously USA, they? read previous article stating outside considerably cause additional spread. really... strange. Sorry said paywalled. trying make create account log able read it. frame discussion unemployment less instead frontline workers paid more? results September, distributed October all? I’ve read it’s already manufactured stockpiled would extrapolate year? city seen sustained elevated death count 2 months. reddit is. widely available simple low cost treatment course reduces risks associated covid19 level line common cold. big party. trickles lawyers tipped bartender yacht club crisp C note. 

The economy fixed! got first dose waiting list forever January...I scheduled second dose 5/1 wait. told first dose gives pretty good coverage. Shingles sucks, mine face near eye. Apparently really bad gets eyes. look [flhealthcharts death count](http://www.flhealthcharts.com/FLQUERY/Death/DeathCount.aspx) - whose numbers 2020 provisional whatever; number pneumonia deaths high.     
What surprisingly number ""Other &amp; Unspecified Infectious/Parasitic Disease &amp; Sequelae"" (where Coronavirus classified there's total number Covid deaths though), number ""Symptoms, signs abnormal findings"" number ""not available"".... reason dealing novel coronavirus recombination different coronaviruses thought affect certain animals. lot undiscovered viruses trasmissible humans could end recombining ones form something else new nasty. important know animals present risk. 


Camels resevoir MERS coronavirus overtly bad symptoms it, deadly humans catch it. schools considering making middle high school kids online learning home(unless disabilities). elementary kids go person school spread elementary, middle high schools. allow keep classes 10 kids safely social distance kids(I think goal 5 kids class). also don’t want use buses. Also kids need wear mask wash hands every hour. said issue running need lot teachers usual.So see actually implement this. district lot money assume it’s issue finding people teach rather pay. F*ck guy. fool Also, hospitals staff operate 75% capacity, let alone 100%. Nurse pt ratio 75% capacity extremely dangerous, catastrophic. normal day ICU nurse gets 2 patients, capacity high nurse may get 3rd. seeing nurses 5 patients critical need constant attention. sustainable, ethical care. Absolutely. Death rate certainly lower shown worldometer. Remember 15% cases confirmed. Multiply get best guess right now. Remember even 1% best guess that's still 10 times deadly flu. people know enough science make good analysis data and/or they're getting data fucked sources ICU beds 90 (87)
Hospitalized (non ICU) 1025

Lombardy reports 109 cases.

Campania (where ongoing outbreak) reports 9 cases vs 24 yesterday. far screening outbreak resulted 3750 swabs performed around 70 positives. Around 40 contacts found first batch 750 28 additional 3000. kind pet shop filled rambunctious yahoos hot jazz music 1:00 morning? Er, uh ... ... best damn pet shop town! Yeah! live across NYC NJ (more specifically, one two towns technically walk city), I’m still going take “brave pills” go meal, whether outdoors indoors fun. work food photographer restaurant shoots I’m still grateful work slowly getting back “normal”, doesn’t feel pandemic go meal fun/a celebratory fashion/etc, I’ve last around March, days Restaurants barred indoor eating.

I support restaurants “other means”, even cannot go eat restaurant fun (aka *I not** paid so), even “rain check” birthday meal Halloween, let alone rest year, it. big loss.  Honestly, shows paid enough. Didn’t blame, don’t think it’s them, clarified. Gaslighting hard ! hate break you, surviving almost serious problem potentially come hospital admits you. doesnt give shit. He'll say: ""the statistics dont know talking about."" Depends live. I'm Hispanic live majority Hispanic city Massachusetts. Masks definitely majority (some places let without it).

Sadly pretty hard hit back April May. biggest problem lot us ""essential"" workers places like supermarkets, factories, LTC's &amp; hospitals spread pretty much inevitable here. Congrats, Mass.! Yeah. That's over. keep saying house partner like, oh negative basic risk v reward, use everything. blame that. remember Buzzfeed article law enforcement used capture migrant slaves return farms.

It's really incredible little Americans seem care this.  Well, Jerome Pence (visibly wearing mask) briefing yesterday stating masks instruments freedom needed worn. We’ll see helps. Italy locked down. Whats AZ doing? So. Much. Winning! right all, sick winning. want ride. I'd think talking North Korea something.

Pretty sure NK paid maternity leave  government health care .  Awful. sorry. Stay safe. death rate CONFIRMED cases. number ACTUAL cases much higher, maybe 5 10 times higher, one say sure, due lack testing availability around world number cases asymptomatic mild people feel need get tested. CDC estimates fatality rate 0.26%, though many feel 0.5-1% range (obviously, factors age comorbidities population make impossible pin one uniform death rate entire world. grandfather said either learn people's mistakes make ourselves. Deaths spike. Question much.

Arizona recorded highest daily toll yet. Go compare pictures reopening protests BLM protests.

One group mostly wore masks. group mostly didn't.

Frankly, reopening protest people wore masks, protest away!

Additionally, many people (me included) think reopening people selfish ""killing grandma"" put selfish killing grandma protesting, calling reopening everything without limits without consideration health safety!

Protest wearing masks, reopen things reasonable, well thought manner safety considerations, I'll support sidelines.

Shit, I'd even willing discussion opening public parks let bars reserve covered picnic areas outdoor drinking park! Go look liquor license town, pick couple parks, draw names hats ask want reserve one shelters evening. Cut 9-10pm so, let bring DJ.

Go list try figure fair way rotate several different bars try hand get income. (Yeah, drinks likely bit expensive price normal.) lol - k. Good. give funding community owned restaurants brand name ones survive easily set. crucial potent point

We screwed without vaccine. Even notion idea vaccine fanciful isn’t seasonal virus- often vaccine need injected individual? 

The vaccine/antibodies effective short time. vaccine may impractical needs multiple injections

Not mention people refuse it. time take actually give every person planet

Covid changed world forever. likely wait naturally run course die out, time damage incomprehensible see one noncommital reply, everything else irrelevent even posted him. might right I've overlooked replies Twitter unusable garbage we'll never know single link. Doubtful though every little thing says gets reposted microanalyzed.. would seen anything controversial already 10 different websites. Maybe....close beaches? Wild. Got argument old hillbilly friends led leaving Facebook day, one girl said, “you scientists, mine.” wanting wear mask. 🤦‍♂️ ""backed out"" making announcement today give idea expect one. assume hoping miracle drop positives since sure we'd going back minimal social distancing. terrible thing parents especially teachers need know plan. can't imagine trying plan two completely different years equal effort six weeks one knows plan is. Well said would break law open tesla early hes firing people working despite mandatory

Buy beds. Duh super large retail company work that’s based Arkansas basically redesigning open office seating allow proper social distancing (so basically begin with). 

The earliest would expect start allowing people back office would late August early September even reduced capacity (50%). there's one group knows direct experience 1) trust federal government right thing, 2) nobody going take care look besides themselves, Indigenous Americans. 

And off-rez AZ surging, time relax things brought control. right call.

We take note: getting control place much extreme poverty hardship (and often lack police presence/top-down enforcement rules) reservation demonstrates matters **everyone *in* community must agree look *whole* community**. rich shit dominant culture ""who cares people marginal comfort risk?"" ""what regardless resources protect community?"" BAD time. thing rez rich love people rez, that's ENOUGH. Cardiovascular death always approximate this. COVID saturate healthcare systems, denying/delaying care overload fear. COVID also *cause* stroke heart attack, especially one living alone. low death rates He's ophthalmologist, I'd still trust people study viruses far. CAN'T SPOUTING FACTS WITHOUT WARNING!!! ALREADY PANTS OFF!!!! ophthalmologist make infectious disease expert. knows much two little balls. Dassit. point clue people even thinking. figure you’d understand good economy getting virus control.

I’m starting wonder people want us die. China lied worse, ok tend agree. 0.2% - 1.0% seems reasonable range possibilities, likely towards middle range. 

Some serology studies (like North Carolina one mentioned) higher rate 5% though - believe 12-14% NC might limitations study I’m aware of, course it’s one data point. assume include retail businesses? that, Americans money stock market form 401k's, can't access money pay rent food without big penalties. Jesus, outright dangerous. Looking cases per capita [for fact indoor venues perfect breeding grounds virus... Probably shorter easier say right mean wouldnt much worse amount listened atm. Shutdowns it’s super contagious, it’s deadly (even though is). Yes people get virus end fine afterward, without shutdowns could overwhelm hospitals leads dramatically deaths. 

This attitude virus didn’t affect people personally knew bad dangerous leads people thinking lockdowns useless, reality save tens thousands lives.  avearage 5+ posts Sweden posted almost daily within hours two months now. really getting tiresome point, articles rehashing older news - rarely one thing happening week next seven days different articles thing several different news agencies ""it new information"".

There reason reddit literally made another sub actual serious discussion. knew would non-stop circle jerk one. mid-pandemic anti-mask sentiment changed way view country humans general substantially. Getting self-administered test tomorrow. chug hot sauce, sinuses get really ""productive"" 5-7 minutes. Would good idea make swabbing easier, could possibly compromise results somehow?

There’s virtually overlap ideas presented. Oh, making stuff sorry, thought serious. bad. weeks ago met somebody claimed 1% cases severe, 9% *of severe cases* died. linked site (that say that, whatever) source. site listed 450K deaths worldwide. asked many worldwide cases thought been, using statistics, 500 million cases 450K deaths occur. even wrote math:

(450,000 deaths)/(9 deaths/100 severe cases)/(1 severe case/100 cases) = 500 million cases.

He never answered question.

So somebody says death rate 0.02%, means we've around 250 million cases far based known deaths 500K. Old people dumb Currently 25k available beds Texas hospitals. Genius! need stop incessant spin protests. Even people arguing caused less people come out. question mass gathering like safe. protests ""good bad."" need data spreads stop whatever is. Saying, well protestors got it, less people out, increase helpful. transmission scenarios, yes no. think people believe, protestors get it, anything goes outdoors people wearing masks. buy that, really need data without spin. usually try refrain insulting people, bunch idiots.

Over? Coronavirus gone? ""Symbolically"" say farewell virus? wonder people gonna feel start falling ill turns it.

Let's makeout party pass egg yolk another person's mouth without breaking it!"" &lt;- yes actually happened group 20-25 year olds, pretty much got Corona.

It's nice sentiment but...sigh. Ok maybe forgot high earners .. meant people earning less max benefit shouldn’t making took home previously... think they're making fun fake cards circulating typo  Sure, fucking hope is; however think vaccine coming first working class America elites get fill haven’t paying attention average American treated far throughout this. historical data death rates everything else. That's why. true vaccines generally take much longer develop, it’s also rare scientists worldwide would working tirelessly project. still rate-limiting steps, certain limitations (like project funding) won’t much issue.

You won’t hear lot firm statements cause still many unknowns... unfortunately “novel” virus, there’s enough evidence yet things like mutations length immunity long-term outcomes virus. Best guesses based similar viruses evidence for, much would expect virus behave similarly won’t know time experience one. someone much smarter explain cases free gotta go drive thru tents get stuck big bill? becauae shitty health care system insurance it? Oh Doctor Lt. Govoner now? this! gummy looks like lips afraid teeth  Yes. spend day every day making masks 2 layers tightly woven 100% cotton filter pocket added protection. donate community.

I've made specifically her, extra comfortable, fitting face proportions, refuses. first asked could crochet mask would basically holes.

No.

I keep asking use ones make her, refuses. topped HS diploma. Yeah, it’s really lame articles don’t even provide link. want keep site. Fucking ridiculous. Especially ac Cavities consequence taking care teeth properly. means taken care teeth bad permanent injury needs checked regularly dentist yes.

If take good care teeth, develop cavities needed checked upon regularly. Quite strange. tool protect around you. like bitching wear seatbelt. understand argument it. Zero? state country reopening plan includes ZERO cases. That's beyond absurd. That's even part CDC recommendation.

CA met guidelines phase reopening, also facing outside influence reopen soon...from Federal gov CA's phased plan currently open **county-by-county** (PDF report card)

And again, **the people** demonstrated act responsibly (or decided openly defy common sense guidance mandates) rolled back needed.

Please stop spreading bullshit. expect governor state 40 million people personally go door-to-door checking peoples' temperatures what? also left yelp review gave incident exposure. there's gofundme linked somewhere thread well Agree! love Founder’s Favorite Strawberry Blonde Cookie Minster definitely going anymore! Notice said get serious. Let's compare 2-3 months. shocked one Arizona, FL, Texas passes new Yorks deaths unfortunately. Hoping enact measures soon though prevent it. I'm saying Texas could hotspot long time ago state stopped it, realize lot current spike due protests, support right protest. Considering limited testing throughout period, catching approximately 75% max number likely deaths pretty solid work state health authorities. lot probably presented complications illness, Old age cardiac arrest, never got deeper look attribution covid. Instagram tagline says ""The secret living giving.” guess includes COVID-19. DeSantis - ""hold beer"". Responding edit. think CDC’s estimate IFR likely 0.26%? looks low end reasonable range, serology studies (like recent one North Carolina) seem back up. 

In event, know risk death low young, quite high old, demographics newly infected extremely important. Yes, since grandpa fought Korea protect god given rights swell fuck up, I'm going!! God bless troops! LT Gov needs roll monster truck lost started saying bother taxing rich people. You’re thinking big enough: government mailed every citizen x masks per month over? (Money valid objection wealthiest country planet.) Yesss don’t understand didn’t translate used google apparently speaks Danish understands Swedish. ppl going? ppl travel? Europe banned US travelers, exception filmmakers syndromic causes death provide crucial additional information severity progression COVID-19 pandemic. Estimates excess deaths less biased variations viral testing, reporting lags need properly accounted for. Even situations ample testing, deaths due viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, occur indirectly via secondary bacterial infections exacerbation comorbidities. **There also secondary effects mortality due changes population behavior brought strict lockdown measures aversion health care system.** Together information official tallies COVID-19 deaths, monitoring excess mortality provides key tool evaluating effects ongoing pandemic.

I think part bolded interesting, see brought often. Actual paper takes like 10 minutes skim paper 3.2 seconds read CNN headline. #fact #lazy say vaccine ready deployment US Europe October likely I've 1 type test. They're legit. holding breath...but may horizon. already did, reported state violating mask mandate appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Fauci also told people wear masks; agenda calm panic. knew beginning COVID would us months told us look next 2 weeks wanted calm panic. That’s job; keep people calm.

You call conspiracy theorist, yet I’m rational. one saving miracle cure available end year; that’s dangerous delusional thinking like even read articles? essentially concept following rich people around hoping bucks fall pocket.  ya go. 50%. think invincible? Population-adjusted like 26,000 cases 450 deaths California. damn glad team shitty enough year play... can’t people illegally cross Canada? 24%? Holy crap.   closed non life sustaining businesses. put stay home order, pulled road, didnt reason going out, would Abbotsford checking in.. love lower mainland Nah, it’s bars protests You’re explicitly saying reason saying “right sort immune response” *because* profit potential. Someone another thread said NY got 40-something positive. probably lot less testing tight restrictions could get tested. actually research would know leading vaccine (oxfords) already existence test, make changes account covid tested again.

Edit: lol wow say reading it. know~ cuts ways would guaranteed expensive. Someone making $85k/year getting amount UI? 

If don’t want people disincentived working, don’t threaten lower earnings. That’s entire reason Universal Basic Income. start, people wouldn’t accepting $2,000/month job make $400 less. They’d making $2,000 + unconditional, universal wage. That’s incentive work, disincentive 😂😂😂😂😂 Fucking man. state benefit $51. Pretty braindead expect anyone live that. even shock bag, bro?  Still lied it.

Caused shitstorm epic proportions seeing people wearing masks.

People died.

Those facts. seen evidence spread actual beach itself? live 5 minutes beaches NJ packed since turned 70 degrees change decline cases. Correlation equal causation, crap get upvoted. “Likely” Masks, distance, wash... normal stuff. I'm 41 fat, wife us also nurse. Although work directly covid patients. Even fat chances dying age slim. take care yourself, perhaps eat better... hurt. chances dropping dead heart attack much much higher dying covid. people say ""the old 2020 years old"" exist, somehow diidnt grasp concept calender estiamted years birth Jesus, literal beginning time itself. assume theses realtivaly defentively ""young earth creatonists"" swear, people US fetish exact opposite helpful North America? Lesson: STAY FUCK HOME SICK!!!!! don’t care it’s covid19 flu, stress staying home away sick New Normal! Obviously, guy way sick die next day. actual cause death? Dehydration? treated diarrhea actual cause would nice know. Let's talk science then. follows historic trends viral outbreaks, develop effective vaccine pandemic over. way ends via natural immunity. 

If points true, masks purely social theater make people *feel* comfortable returning normal; still inevitably get sick. Never said I'm pro-swedish strategy, I'm interested agenda constantly posting negative views instead positives, good user gain it? I've observed user stands majority posts regarding Sweden negative. Ok that's spot on. that’s takes, world undergo sea change! Grow brain cells! way mask mandates handed down, business enforce. Businesses never want push away customer, even since stay home orders disrupted normal business, need customers get stay afloat.

Few businesses going risk fallout headache enforce mandates. travel restrictions Sweden countries like US, UK? AZ resident here. 

Mostly monies curious, 5 months away reddit suddenly come spam pro-swedish strategy message everywhere?      
I mean, really helping like swedish trolls constantly downvote failures Swedish strategy bragged months strategy best rest Europe clueless. Yes did, got fined, people fired charged. change fact still quality brand building enticing EV option Georgian. I’m sorry loss. believe Lyndon Johnson people quote that. Thats really stealing election tho... Stealing election would something fraudulent like mail ballots cant actually verified Nope. Wrong. Add extra vitamin C zinc. wear masks go where.  Wtf wrong USA read paper article thanks Ok, point being?

Fauci still lied. people died. Texan I've voted idiots every election. incredibly frustrating sensible Texans stuck mess always voted support. :( like literally happened NY foreign Mainstream media pick create sick conspiracy theories. Disgusting double standards play here. Well, thankfully one saving grace Sweden universal healthcare. functioning well moment, years due austerity policies hey better nothing. oh fuck off

i've never voted ghouls, far I'm concerned represent friends. unfortunately we're stuck 2022.  Shhhhhhh, Abbott finds ""ask"" hospital change reporting. sudden be, "" 20 hospitalizations""....where 600 go? ....""What 600, stop trying politicize monster!"" mean, remember march? Would rather president go live TV say meat industry fucked?

As nation already proved can't handle that. Get liking it, method medicine treating humans. ""Society afraid. Otherwise, we'll economic crisis, depression hit society harder Covid-19,"" Kobza said.

Corona ain't thing spreading, BS too. u/undeleteparent house still quarantining self isolating much possible, get shit it. friend (who got back Florida vacation 2 households) tells I’m ridiculous staying “everyone gets it’s bad people age”. 

Her argument basically it’s inevitable getting might well live normally. Selfish honestly dangerous thinking. friend got “at safe dinner party quarantining weeks!!!” went vacation feels whatever likes “has antibodies”. wanted scream. People like exactly I’m staying long possible. Correct. funny game youre playing want money, care much causing suffering, possibly duped misinformation. lol. Yeah, that’s was. Americans hate lied demand Fauci lie say things great. least Regan Governor several years. Trump leaped highest office land nothing. like Doug Ford. said, handling admirably. calm mostly collected. delivers strong message partisan makes case simply clearly. 

On personal note, tough watch react militaries report state nursing homes Ontario. Give little google buddy lol, oh honey... Huge numbers selfish, far-right morons mainly Ah yes, ignore experts. could possibly go wrong? Agreed. also *necessary* work becomes automated. Esp. example / driverless trucking becomes thing instance. People going need eat, eliminate bunch jobs can't get work? 

It makes sense. Fun fact: US founding father Thomas Paine argued version UBI 1795, American revolutionary Thomas Paine advocated citizen's dividend United States citizens compensation ""loss natural inheritance, introduction system landed property"" (Agrarian Justice, 1795). 

From wikipedia. even new concept! ARGH. wish bigger part discussion re: pandemic since blunt perfect time implement UBI due ""shock doctrine"" (using crisis create huge change). Shock doctrine used good ill, tbh usually used ill sigh. Oh boy I'm seeing that, shockingly educated people, too. see LOT.

Goes elected lieutenant governor Texas 👏👏👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉🎉 seen 100% mask compliance subway since Phase 1 started.

Queens, borough coronavirus cases fewest hospital beds per capita, hundreds patients languished understaffed wards, often unwatched nurses doctors. died removing oxygen masks go hospitals impoverished neighborhoods around boroughs, critically ill patients put ventilator machines lacking key settings, others pleaded experimental drugs, told none available.

This systemic problem. There's individual solution here. could easily tackled political leaders desire to. one cares worker bees die.

I repeat told sister, nurse: ""Don't stress yourself. care went catch virus, care anymore either leave hospital time shift."" New York Times article:

Around country, bars becoming a common source of coronavirus outbreaks. Louisiana, least 100 people tested positive virus after visiting bars Tigerland district, popular destination Louisiana State University students. In Idaho, health officials shut bars Ada County reporting clusters infections among young adults visited several bars downtown Boise.

And several Florida bars are source large outbreaks. Jacksonville Beach, a group 16 friends went pub celebrate birthday — within days 16 tested positive Covid-19. Orlando Pride women’s soccer team forced withdraw upcoming National Women’s Soccer League tournament six players four staff members tested positive Covid-19 — reportedly younger players visited bars nightclubs area reopened.

Studies also show particles emit talking loud speech potentially infectious larger droplets expel cough sneeze. Smaller particles persist air for longer time periods settling, increasing risk someone nearby could inhale them. Smaller particles also can travel respiratory tract

Another factor makes bars risky alcohol. people drink, forget coronavirus even worry. “Alcohol course disinhibit people perhaps promote even breaches social distance sharing drinks food,” said Dr. Bitton

The **biggest challenge** slowing spread coronavirus may demographic group likes frequent bars. Around country, more young people testing positive for coronavirus ignoring social distancing measures.

Texas recently saw rapid increase case counts. Deaths lag, early know.

Of southern US, Texas largest, populated, well-known. causes often butt jokes despite typically epitome many outsiders make be. Oh I’m sorry, pandemic bleak?

Unless tell wear mask blame Federal government help people stay home time worry losing livelihoods Absolutely not. I'm weary pessimist please point study showing large scale reinfection, source claim? novel disease, scientists messed mask. literally data, studies, case studies, etc. data support masks.

Why people acting like scientists need flawless?

Ughhh...I love hockey, really hope cause outbreaks Alberta. see people, ones already follow rules, creating rule breaking situations surrounding hockey! Canada's Achilles heel?? 🤦🏻‍♀️ Thank much!! pretty much everywhere. 20-40 seems infected also least hospitalized least killed. 

I’ve looked case numbers many Canadian provinces, American states, countries reporting depth details 20-44 seems consistently one infected (at least officially reported groups) hospitalization rates almost universally around 2% fatalities around 0.1-0.2%, hospitalization deaths skewing higher end range also people multiple underlying conditions.

## Abstract

Approximately every 100 years, witnessed last two centuries, facing influenza pandemic, necessitating need combat novel virus strain. result new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 \[SARS‐CoV‐2\] outbreak January 2020, many clinical studies carried aim combating eradicating disease altogether. However, far, developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) detection kits vaccines remained elusive. regard, development antiviral nanomaterials surface engineering enhanced specificity might prove valuable combat novel virus. Quantum dots (QDs) multifaceted agents ability fight against/inhibit activity COVID‐19 virus. article exclusively discusses potential role QDs biosensors antiviral agents attenuation viral infection. clear restaurant bars business longest fully reopen.
And even partial reopening, like done least 2m table group household allowed, enough long term avoid lot closure.

I hope governments help place stay business without compromising public health. 
It may long, crisis pass one day hope restaurant still open big brands could financially pass trough. Yeah that's what's happening country hates intelligence science I'm shocked answer. Enjoy Covid-19 outbreak, enjoy freedom reopening. restaurant would turn parking lot drive area people eat person wrong. 10-14 days, 4-5 weeks. sheet scraps making curtains costumes. kept use crafts pockets. Swede living Denmark here. going going Norway vacation turned much expensive vacation originally planned. Driving Sweden isn’t free gas ferry expensive well. we’re Denmark instead. I'm dying Must present win raffle... Unfortunately so. Best case scenario average citizen gets hand vaccine Christmas 2021. 

That’s create worlds fastest vaccine passes human trials America could secure enough provide citizens affordable Dale Gribble stereotype exists reason immunosuppressed person I'm relieved. can't count herd immunity anymore great. CO record high new cases. CO hit hard beginning decent job, now, CO full tourist, majority Texas, guess see goes. think know. country from? believe [this that's true all. 

Reported deaths lag 4-5 weeks. time death time gets officially reported totals takes weeks. whataboutism hard predict - factor user behavior damn unpredictable US. believe self modulating system - won;t shut down, people going turtle US starts hitting 1500 deaths day say fuck cases go 750 day.

But maximum economic pain maximum health impact....the cheese doodle crowd starting understand this. went Saratoga Springs primarily nature takeout - outdoor dining people werent sitting eat drink pretty good wearing masks. NYCer tho - glad pausing indoor dining. EVER want go back constant sirens. Don’t worry it’s joke working conditions without hazard pay too; everybody except big corporations getting bent over.

They’ve dangling hazard pay carrot since April, still haven’t seen dime. least guys get extra $600 don’t work hazardous conditions risking life people refuse wear masks.

And play extending $600; don’t worry much make call.

It’s cheaper pay $600 unemployed people pay back pay essential workers start pandemic; play. Next they’ll find reason people get kicked unemployment, isn’t going away year end. owned 20% solar city Conservatism. Denying Science since beginning. Dunno, cancelled graduation party us looking forward time true live forever, I'll damned party catalyst attendees living past month.

We celebrate months control. claimed

We yet, sure we're using past tense. July. old articles terms current news cycle, first one says 200 million would ready end year. 

news flash there’s 330 million people america bet 130 million get one choice.

can’t stand pessimism go somewhere it. genuine question this. I'm New Yorker and, like study suggested, everyone know (myself included) knows someone died COVID. We've seen it. really think denying taking seriously would change tunes loved ones passed away? 'far gone' change even then?  long take get results? brother law wait five days results (in Arizona it’s spiking guess that’s typical wait time?). Mayo Clinic already recalled antibody test due inefficient antibody assay results. joke countries... moved BC September (to Calgary). Glad family safe Island. They've gone back 'normal'. cause hicks gonna hick! One size fits solutions work U.S. big.


It's like Star Trek episode. places science consistant. places medicine, biology, sciences ain't right, work here.


/s -(The US become example WHAT?) Two nights ago forecast said 30% chance rain overnight. guess what, rained overnight.

538 gave Trump roughly odds winning 2016. incredibly stupid. No, I'm saying misunderstood data trying quote. 0.26% people NYC died coronavirus. 0.26% covid-positive people.

Think learning moment. ok. [Kinda technical, going real source realized walmart since pandemic began lol  march reddit banned 2000 subreddits, going let one, whose members send death threats pro maskers, create posts like ones consistently, stick around?  also fun fact: US pharma spend 5~10 times marketing countries dont.

that oughta solve mystery. Sounds like order needs revised law enforcement held responsible refusing enforce lawful orders Yea know. also realize many deaths come nursing homes right? majority countries makes majority cases. America able keep nursing homes would saved 48,000 lives. would 72,000 deaths. Basically really bad flu season. Canada it’s 80% list goes countries messed allowing nursing homes.  Hey can't find anything Google found mask washing machine, ones hospitals use blue outside white inside, safe use trash it?  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ !Remindme 2 weeks virus eradicated via vaccination smallpox.

Meet rather, meet it. it, too, viral disease totally eradicated via vaccination.

The fact disease cows irrelevant. fact vaccine extincted motherfucker relevant. don’t understand Yes. Repeatedly California averaged 14 new cases per 100k population past 5 days. Texas averaged close 20 time period. 85 College Athletes die every year average.

Dexamethasone seems far promising, terms saving actual lives, understanding cheap already widely available. masks mandated free provided every citizen public service. studies transmissions prior mitigation efforts. transmissions occurred March. still packed light rail, concerts, parties, clubs, office buildings March people infected simple, people trust government mainstream media. really blame though? Human vs. Nature's complete arsenal NJ got ravaged early they’re well now. NYC. He's quite bloated compared even couple years ago. Drinking much? late hope maybe virus mutate less destructive then? remember post April (I think) Italian researcher thought already starting happen think confirmed. whole thing bleak I'm trying find something maybe hope make less bleak, all. think preventing spreading? would use mask face shield. would also assume exposed get off. fine since young healthy, need careful interact afterwards. American health care system. complicated one make definitive statement anything. financial penalty comment fair game   Yeah don’t play   According newsfeed fb 2500 folks Florida tell never follow restrictions general rule. Maybe 50% might others won’t. claim following “all rules” yet see pics pool parties, cookouts, restaurants, bars, packed without masked soul sight. serious issues US 8th deaths Per capita (If believe China, Russia, Iran...). US second number tests (If believe China), 27th tests per capita. Aaaaaand better China? 

The answer better. big name programs nutritionists chefs working athletic dinning facilities personalize cook kids meals. even personalized snacks practice smoothies practice.

Same thing supplements, we're talking large universities here, they're buying shit GNC lol. dietary exercise science people get everything, nature, bulk test in-house then, give players need. Football players probably allowed within 100 yards GNC multitude reasons.

Suffice say, player high blood pressure, they're going treat it, make worse. kill fans making lot money. Pretty sure could much wanted to. heavily armed, rarely caught act youtube. Hip hop Hooray! 

Ho!

Hay!

Ho! going take shit anyone. argue. say say walk away. 

That's good advice. woman done would done. Instead argued drew confrontation out. opening scene show newsroom, Jeff Daniel's character asked answer question America greatest country world poignant statement issue. shot 4 years trump, certain statistics quoted changed, almost definitely worse No. like joke masks help facial recognition! good thing! 

But seriously, wear mask. big deal. live LA run car grab something, wear face mask. drive car, wear face mask drive car. go walk, bring face mask I'm ready put people walking towards near me. get car go grocery store public place, wear fucking face mask. really get big deal wearing them...

And know people like hear wear run outside real quick know need better honesty, LA. smells like shit piss everywhere really, jokes me, face mask would certainly help smells lol I’ve learned whole “states” thing pretty fucking dumb. Also check r/gangstalking currently happening America, feel like people double obstinate stupidity even less people normal get flu shots. probably think far ahead :)

the person posted Facebook convinced whole coronavirus thing hoax, i've tried talk them, impossible, hard believe intelligent people stupid. Nobody saying masks protect others. order ensure protection, need mask fit tested certified job. can't beard, stache anything else interferes seal. people access simple facemasks, even n95-grade masks, properly fitted.

And top that, need trained proper doffing procedures take without infecting yourself.

Masks protect wearer too, fuckload complicated protecting others. You... realize everyone 45 lives nursing home right? 50 year olds work active lives? Here's happen, experienced Texas. Two three weeks ago height committed ""caution wind"" attitude toward virus. ""if get it, get it"" kind attitude. little mask usage precautionary attitudes anyone. Even me, typically religious mask usage, would occasionally walk gas stations without one on. thinking was, ""if one else going take health seriously, worry wearing mask?"" 

Last week, especially toward end week, people started perk pay attention, still large amount people believed hoax.

As last days, attitude markedly different. 

As days ago, seems like nearly everyone knows least one person it, longer debate whether virus real. Even super-conservative counties Texas passed mask ordinances-- many enacted today. mask participation, already pretty high Austin since passed mask ordinances last week, hundred percent. even getting close percentage highly-conservative county mom lives in. 

So basically I'm trying say is: give another couple days see Plexi glass barriers coming back up; give week two max see everyone wearing masks. 

I glad virus finally started affecting places northeast hopefully we, entire country 50 States time, respect New York since mid-March. Maybe one lockdown take get us working together common-sense things see rest world doing. Good you. Plenty laughed prepared. prepare knew coming one way other. Iirc Bush lost re-election. Florida votes would swung way voter suppression counting fuckery happening. Years fact learned bush would lost are. Oh no, that's gonna make Trump even angrier China. One million total deaths probably top end total US deaths entire pandemic assuming treatments vaccines ever found. possible way hitting January say fuck open everything without care. voting today help. shit ants swarming shit sandwich, picnics ruined Randy. SREPMURT: impossible! No, spent money ice cream Kidz Bop CDs. True. Plus Aussies go dental work. I’m still working fortunately I’ve worked remotely home 6 years now. according state I’m also receiving unemployment someone fraudulently filed me...which know wouldn’t survive unemployment. Ok I'm going try figure out. everyone paid 5$ pill new drugs would happen Found him! No, flatten curve applies period uncontrolled spread. never end goal, keep R0 1 testing tracing, social distancing, hygiene, etc. people feel comfortable resuming semi-normal activity like first world countries doing. Nobody wants 2+ million dead americans. surprising. People rural areas think lower risk nobody wears masks. virus carrier come town, everyone exposed heroes wear capes... need people like you. Keep fighting good fight; friend recently told me, stay frosty! much winning! bet Obama never many new cases reported daily! listen fake news, like tests, made myself, team grades them. best. best graders. Led wonderful daughter Ivanka, I'd totally shot with, know, married. father. Also, I'm going golfing again. Oh yes, seven states didn’t lock down:

Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming

Ah, Arkansas, bustling state population industry, beacon progress.

Never mind fact states didn’t full stay home order doesn’t mean sat idly nothing. seven states closed schools, one thing. also closed ton businesses, including restaurants bars. sure, since wasn’t formal lock probably pointless, right?

Pay attention fact almost states high end confirmed cases per population, either.

 Countries followed protocols locked early hard already shunning us open trade other.

Wasn't aware subreddit. Thanks sharing. Pretty much cementing getting anything takeout anywhere quite time, hell servers going through. case, receive coronovirus test all. That's problem. physician referred emergency room evaluated provided test (they any). ER visit covered CARES $3500 deductible plan. get tested, whole visit might covered. ridiculous.

Important takeaway end point pandemic, tests widely available federal law clearly side: charged cost sharing coronavirus test.  wary, though, doctor directs emergency room test, additional care get could come high price. Ask testing sites available. I'm dumb misinterpreted post, sorry! Seriously, bad. much disagree completely.  Every plan seen federal government leading organizing fight pandemic. Shifting supplies need greatest.  Although can't prove across board lockdown could allowed us reopening now.   locking things back another try. US response piecemeal state state. virus care state borders. Even clean 1918 pandemics knew response come federal level. They're literally trying take health care away millions Americans right moment...... Skimmed article, sorry missed it, see anything mentioned permanent lung damage. Mind pointing quoting directly? said thing: One million dead millions infected. half America take seriously.  Fuck right off. Nurses treat patients.

Wearing mask microchipped, branded anything that’s remotely identifying. wear mask bit going groups. simple tweak every day life use masks valves. let air/particles out, they're effectively like wearing mask comes protecting around you. point's made...  Oh Fucci isn’t enough, man child president doesn’t much. takes fucking banks teach us masks needed.

Why banks listen to. Faucci’s world need listen Well HIV different, without treatment 100 percent fatality rate. contracted HIV 80’s going die rather unpleasantly. COVID even 10 percent fatality rate bet ass people would panicking. 40 years life America I've come realize vast majority citizens self absorbed see 5 feet front face. feel like r/selfawarewolves exist without America. sad really. Today county [was open public rules masks requirements. listening public comments turn live stream. Everyone speaking wearing masks either dishonest stupid point painful watch.

To save trouble, took notes person masks proposal spoke. time listened summary anti mask person said order spoke without speaker left out. maybe 1 pro mask speaker every 5 anti mask speakers meeting time listened public comments.

Also, public comments cloth masks (non N95), purpose common reusable cloth masks might wear prevent contracting covid-19. covid-19 air stop virus getting through.

BUT, key, people may covid-19 wear cloth masks, mask stop larger droplets aerosolizing leave mouth nose, greatly reducing distance virus travels hence ability spread easily.

In summary, cloth masks similar facial coverings meant protect getting virus, meant stop people virus spreading you.

So end unfortunately county decided mandate masks certain businesses, also asks businesses post signs recommended wearing masks.

**Summary anti mask comments public hearing**

Also, 5 7 states 10 sparsely populated states. Wyoming 6 people per square mile, North Dakota 11. Compared New Jersey, 1,207. estimated number cases underreported 10x back April bit math. 


By using numbers/estimates: 
1. 50% cases asympotomatic show symptoms 
2. 80% cases mild enough need hospitalization 


So, USA reports 40,000 new cases per day right now, counts severe enough go hospital get tested. know several people think get tested simply stayed home mild. would imagine lot people cateogry save money test avoid hospital, could infect covid already it, well cost lot. decent estimate total infected, including tested, tested, including 50% asymptomatic carriers, 80% mild symptoms stay home: 
40,000 / (1-0.80) / (1-0.50) = 400,000 cases per day

[US NIH use crazy high doses earlier studies concluded ""treatment harm.""

[Study modest doses HCQ + AZT + zinc started relatively early resulted reduced ICU admissions half number intubations deaths! table study explained someone PhD 

They using [similar combo Brazil](http://covexit.com/new-brazilian-study-shows-telemedicine-hydroxychloroquine-treatment-reduce-need-for-hospitalization/) along telemedicine success reduce number people admitted hospitals. 

[A study France](http://covexit.com/ihu-marseille-research-on-3737-covid-19-patients-published/) 3000 people reported sudden deaths heart problems. lead doctor claimed [hospital lowest death](http://covexit.com/a-look-at-covid-mortality-in-paris-marseille-new-york-and-montreal/) rate world. 

The impressive ""[Time Death"" French study shows least HCQ buys time treatments fight virus effects. 

HCQ cure. [slows virus](http://covexit.com/zinc-emerging-as-a-key-in-hydroxychloroquine-based-treatments/).  limited usefulness. work well infection requires ICU admission.  people certain heart problems can't safely take it.  However, taken early phase infection modest doses along zinc antibiotic HCQ often helpful.

American stupidity China Russia’s greatest weapon. I'm still waiting faith healers, anti-vaxxers rekki followers show cure everyone one go. folks? “If want insult dumb people.” 

-Spongebob  Nail coffin , good point I've browsing r/covid19 since thing started. say ever downplayed gravity situation, though sometimes people rally optimistic theories came up. blame them. Hope hard thing come days. sure!! Much small sample size customary. Haha

Like many things COVID19 related, real data hindsight. think narrative anti-vaxxers negatively impacting choose get vaccinated misleading general. family vaccinated vaccine effective us, protected regardless many individuals choose get vaccinated around us. 

Natural Selection way suppose. 

I also think statistics regarding many high risk individuals intend get vaccinated important overall outcome vaccine. consider primary goal reduce hospitalizations deaths anyway. Also don’t think 80+ year olds properly represented/participating Washington Post polls. quarantine Mass 4 fucking months due newborn. legitimately left house since beginning March. crazy see states act like since NE control also decide open back shut weeks. Fucking. Morons.

It takes months flatten curve, weeks people. original headline combination post made look like Germany split significantly - true. Well 28 weeks later... 7 billion people worldwide less million deaths. say *people* Texas dumb? strip naked sit lava lamp  Cases continue level 10 days / 2 weeks lockdown.

This happened every developed nation significant outbreaks. Wtf? People want panic assured us Trvmp Train brakes. called Swedes can't take criticism lol. like long time sub.

QC/ON/BC remain provinces higher risk due larger population, increased border passings US big three cities, quite confident relative control feel dangerously close arguing masks, clear, spend far many hours day convincing people wear masks. Likewise, people trust Fauci. trust him.

I think getting caught semantics. Read recommend everyone wear mask public early on? No, opposite. He's clearly saying give guidance wear mask order protect supply.

To many us clear time. I'm keeping masks. without masks may opportunity acquire masks, even use home made masks, given guidance false.

No parse words say, ""that's lie"" ""that's lie either"", reality is, knew masks effective stopping spread, instead giving guidance, wanted make sure front line workers them.

You're making sound like early data, even speculation masks would help prevent spread, data came Fauci realized masks could help. make smart all, contrary statements making happened. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I'm sure people fought WWI truly believed ""The War End Wars."" statement incredibly ludicrous. long people coughed hand avoid shooting saliva everywhere common courtesy,,,mask face shield extension thoughtfulness Got link material? Try limit contact others, wear mask live Sensible country work others go corona test. *enters parallel universe 5G masks make constipated 2 percent death rate SC, NC, TX dumb though They're their.

Instead people bitching people getting unemployment etc. outraged people paying much money getting tested virus, essential workers forced job people serving could give less shit lives, people evicted homes chose food shelter. cradling stupid stock market.. making bets medicines going make money.. deciding masks good idea finally sinking going save money.

Our government failed us. see many long time members Congress voted out, it'll blessing disguise them; they'll never deal fallout pandemic they'll never held accountable.

We needed swift legislation freeze rent mortgages, offer stipends food utilities, robust plan quarantine eventually get Americans working again. leaders callous, silver spoon fed, businessmen only. They're geniuses great thinkers. office profit cronies. never skill sets great leaders. products utmost privilege.

Weeeeeeeee! I'm making assumption. I'm saying parents responsibility figure out, one else's.  look Iran. They'll probably start rise month new cases started rising, set alarm July 8. many countries stuffing badly lot example countries look long deaths take follow new cases. Iran best indication.  realize they’re baby right became pregnant knew coronavirus thing, right? many people able give drug up, I’m sure know often ends early grace. Congrats man stranger I’m proud make sure keep especially little one! kind people need arrested  I’m talking NYC!!!! New York State.

I feel powerless.

We received single full load PPE since... February? March?

We'll never finished prepping unless things change. Protests. NYC next. Canada like Europe. Look US does, opposite Hospitalizations dropping, however, possible

The state also trying get handle duplicate reports, too, apparently double counting deaths, actually hard tell happening Think small city suburb 100,000 near live, imagine every resident testing positive Cv19 day “so let everyone risk wana risk”. problem selfish dumb shits like you. simply don’t get it. aren’t risking “what wanna risk” yourself, risking people. don’t give damn croak. happen though dumb cattle hospitals start overflow oh don’t know, people miss cancer screenings (because “essential”) greatly increase mortality cancer future. Someone die preventable disease near future choose selfish dumb fuck. It's.... June. Jesus looks like mcrib [Ottawa's Medical Officer health stated based contact tracing]( cities I've heard second-hand, could based changes aggregate numbers rather tracing. Lol, that's good one. insane people do. already mask on. pull down, especially talk, defeats purpose? truly think somehow muffles voice zero effect whatsoever. highly infectious? non disease death rates safety measures implemented law help lower numbers. 

The simple fact matter community, proper measures, social distancing mask wearing two important, prevent deaths. long run, adhere measures, number infected go down, deaths. 

I see correlation listing death rates except ones community, take preventative measures lower them. do. traffic laws seatbelt laws lower car accident death rates. numerous safety regulations help prevent accidental injuries. rules regarding swimming locations (fences, lifeguards). regulations ability obtain gun. every death rate mentioned biological self preventative, we, society, taken measures enacted laws help prevent deaths. virus different? hard inconvenienced temporarily greater good? poignant part virus around forever. point, whether treatment vaccine combination both, able stomp virus out. Everything else mentioned likely claim people's lives forever. one thing actually defeat forever (at least particular virus) working together divisive topic. makes damn sense me. political affiliations pure selfishness, failing. quite saddening.

And please take attack, evaluated data way comment. looked data made surface connection. proper evaluation think disingenuous make claim.

I'm advocating full shutdown (we missed window), advocating social gathering. believe need inconvenienced accept cannot live lives completely normal while. think people working. think people socializing (albeit outside safety measures). believe comment added nothing meaningful discussion though. vibe seemed ""people die here's list mostly unrelated things kill people. See, bad."" seem rational intelligent, truly believe comment quite detrimental. painted picture easily digestable numbers compare, message misleading. People also side topic, far much doom gloom. comment struck trying rational without actually rational. Roll (cough) Tide. wonder prevalent is, worrying think many people getting tested costs involved. Meanwhile Texas still holding July bar exam law grads choice loans owed soon need job health insurance. Many states holding July bar exam, including Florida 2 billion enough vaccinate west Yeah, that's phase 1 2 trials do. number vaccine candidates already completed phases. Next week sometime passed. could end pandemic finding super spreader USA Trump/GOP popular older generations? 

Also, economic impact coronavirus far higher limited support government offers percent older people Nothing adds able understand basic math lack semblance reading comprehension.

It’s tough world there. ""All according plan"" --Trump, probably Sorry made angry maybe I'm missing point here.

You forcing take vaccine virus kills elderly unhealthy/sick people restricting freedom.

I force you, take vaccine, go ahead mind caught virus sneeze face, protected magical vaccine anyway. wanted point Uruguay Paraguay winter far fine contact tracing. Australia Mongolia ok. side, save Paraguay Uruguay, rest Latin America Sweden that's 10k people 0.1% population, though idea number going stop going (or, indeed, ever will).

That's quite lot usual disasters like Chernobyl Bhopal. like bad year Iraq War. know, psychology pretty interesting. 5 years ago, headline ""50k Syrians die fight ISIS"" I'd hear expressions horror, single soul saying ""That's bad 0.2% population"". modern disasters death toll greater 1% population accumulated many years. Rwanda Holocaust bad get beyond that.

Anyway, issue death toll goes \~0.01-0.1%, probability knowing someone died increases significantly. people impacted directly. many, like friend, dead parent, even though young people severely ill. reality war torn countries. people survive even see much fighting themselves, end everything lost family friends. 

To finish, agree Swedish experiment extremely useful. think they've saved many lives indirectly around world, see works doesn't, thanks Swedes (and Japanese). yes, I'd hate them. Already many dead around Sweden worse country. understand eyes lot ACE2 receptors mostly inside (i.e. retina), surface (cornea) virus get eyes need travel tear ducts respiration system chance infect you, relatively low-risk.
"" ACE-2 demonstrated aqueous humour retina, conjunctival corneal epithelia."" ""Since ACE-2 receptors demonstrated conjunctiva cornea, transmission droplet spread may occur viral particles tears drained nasolacrimal duct respiratory tract."" mean vaccine likely decrease R0 value? would shame true, otherwise I'd say cutting R0 half would great start. r/latestagecapitalism expected US cases simply number people, strength testing regime, quick onset virus, lack leadership, lack sense sacrifice community.

According UK clinical phase1/2 trial submitted March 20, actual start date April 23, 2020 estimated study completion date May, 2021. 

Assuming serious adverse events first 6 months Phase 1/2 trials, maybe Oxford could start Phase 3 trials end October, 2020, there'd way finalize phase 3 trial end year given timeline.

So, barring additional input? Yeah. 6-12 months, best case. would approval, necessarily distribution. enacting classic whataboutism here? Oh god.

Please. days lockdown started UK, attended friend's funeral suicided. first funeral ever seeing everyone room lifeless parents looked made feel even worse already was. valuable think. bad enough someone dies Covid-19 even sadder whwn suicided.

I'm also going bit mad lockdown (I'm UK may relate since we're different stage seen cases rising yet). please, answer. It’s Russian roulette Agreed. blm protests continued 6 weeks? Yeah, thing here. Entire temporary hospitals paid months. Aaahhhh frustrating, people dying??😩 feel bad taco chain. stupid people. That's good point. Edmund Burke thought intellectual progenitor traditional conservatism political philosophy, would roll grave saw behaviour today's so-called conservatives. It’s crazy man, people still think phenomenal job get-go.

Retail employees, hair dressers, bus drivers, health workers, neighbors? It’s starts top. case, President* trump following plans gov. nothing. 

This make eventual shutdowns much harder put place. Phase One: Hide numbers

Phase Two: Fake numbers

Phase Three: Phase Three agree points. 

Cool mostly agree thanks nitpicks! means, every study I've seen, 1/3 people went hospital....

Admittedly, read studies. I've head buried Sweden past weeks make time r/COVID-19 like used to! think Telegraph article wrong? says: three patients recover coronavirus could harmed life, long-term damage lungs, well chronic fatigue psychological disturbances, research suggests. said growing evidence virus could cause persistent even permanent trauma, including impairment brain increased risk Alzheimer’s disease. guidance seen Telegraph suggests around 30 per cent patients recover Covid-19 may left damaged scarred lung tissue, follows patterns similar diseases. could amount around 100,000 300,000 people far tested positive UK. Limited testing pandemic means figure may still estimates suggest around 3.5 million people UK likely infected Covid, meaning 1 million could left facing long-term consequences. 

This *not* seem distinguish mild hospitalized cases, unfortunately. proved summer. 

True, South Korea proved work winter. fact, better winter spring one goes numbers. winter, flu R-value might twice high summer. 

I think R value increasing seasons people inside (hot summers US south, cold winters Nordics) seems like reasonable hypothesis point. can't say SURE much course! places going reopen schools winter?

Yes, research shows children MAIN driver transmission. heard recent TWiV account maybe 15-20% nothing sure! Nordics successful social distancing schools keep winter. going double contact tracing effectiveness,

One hopes so, ofc can't say sure. Major efforts ongoing Nordic counties continually improve TTI. 

 fully seal borders like China? 

Not fully, probably hotspots like US, Russia, Sweden, Brazil, etc. yes. however, Iceland right experimenting letting many world testing border. theory could also work mainland Nordics seal border Russia Germany Denmark, Germany also ok job (having issues right now, hopefully dealt with). problem. 

Yep is. Would less Sweden right middle. :/ think everyone region right wishes could swap Sweden Iceland. flip side, practicing contact tracing going crucial gets harder.

Very true. Mistakes continue made. learning mistakes key, imo happen region. FWIW background cliamte science post r/collapse noooooooooooooot exactly optimist lol. even though tend HIGHLY skeptical pick everything apart find loose thread unravel still think Nordics particular good chance TTI. 

Another remarkable detail situation: Norway HUGE border Sweden impossible properly control. One (apparently far right racist sigh) politician recently suggesetd using military control further. what's remarkable even porous border, Sweden sitting right highest infection burden developed Europe, Norway still one countries LOWEST burden infection Europe whole world. thought interesting sort goes traditional wisdom island nations TTI successfully. huge landlocked region shares border another one well. 

I think we're finding virus easy contain via TTI dared hope new. could wrong ofc, prove sadly admit it, evidence seems pointing way. Maybe stopped voting people whose campaigns funded big pharma, would start. So's son * Swedish employees take paid sick leave.

Your strawmen work better they're obviously wrong. believe thousands people congregate outdoors wear masks virus can't spread? guess cool allow fans sporting venues long wear masks concerts outdoor venues cool. potential behaviors could spread virus? Sorry I'm arguing many people - thought one ""more testing cases fine"" morons situation Denmark comparable - exactly community transmission halted here, new cases become interesting opportunities learn infection paths. Tracking quite another level US.

We anti racist demos - one 10.000 participants dysfunctional social distancing, event yielded 4 new cases. Perhaps. 2 attended 2 infected 2 demos - know 2 originally got infected. clear evidence demo part play here.

One bus ride one end Denmark (9 hours) - yielded least 4 new cases.

A plane Pakistan - 18 cases! 

Let's make wild guess - A/C viral loads helluva mix?

Also, we've reduced attendance soccer matches time issues, spectators allowed weekend. Yes, please keep pleasant polite. It’s thing keeping everything together. condoms, again. Seriously. HIV became threat... people realised risks...and people made bullshit excuses Pure selfishness. making go away. avoiding overwhelmed medical system preventing unnecessary death. People talk media hype- media reporting global pandemic US handling really well. bad enough military take seriously bad enough fill ICUs, something taken seriously. think China welded people homes? love citizens much. mean panic? think so, mean stupid stick head sand. LOL true all. 764 deaths according Worldometers. numbers ones trust. Paywalls disallowed sub. Don’t forget killing season started new graduates hit floor running without last semester school  TRUMP VIRUS breaking many records. Beautiful numbers. President leaving mark history books. Bro don‘t understand think don‘t know that? fuck say due increase testing? true. heard recent podcast said people misunderstood comment. takes seriously. good see someone gets ...  crap fear America. Neighbors turning neighbors, family turning family. Friends turning friends. disgusts me.  No, think. many contagious? understand regimes Russia Brasil downplayed Covid-19 coming back bite @$$es point.

What way harder believe also happening one advance powerful country world.

What time living in... Especially seeing much country requires another shutdown sort, needs aid people. exactly get take people hostage shitty 'stimulus' 'incentivize' work. People went work spend like administration wanted, cost undoing good lockdown did. make well minimum wage state weekly unemployment (without $600) $35 week

Can explain this? something pondering trying understand $600 important people, seems beyond greed. 


What justification paying $35? always impression UI payouts (pre pandemic) decent % someone's take-home earnings.  Yes, is. certain rise cases shutdown expected, rise like USA bad news floods hospitals eventually morgues. Problems always start politicians ignore warnings scientists. fall Rome took hundreds years. Let’s hope something little quicker. that’s fair, that’s moronic take.

We medical professionals within government. mandate masks public safety hurts literally one oversteps bounds.

You can’t expect uneducated populace, especially one voted politicians way vote favorite celebrity, individually choose best option community safety. True, northern states option wait year fight civil war nobody would die either side sure would have. I’m saying don’t protest ever, kill black lives police ever along plenty people still first wave. Lockdown means literal quarantine that's actively enforced. advised stay home closing non essential businesses lockdown.

It entirely depends define lockdown. US states put restrictions place full lockdown like see countries. Virginia lot military bases, strategically probably good idea, plus would create nice straight border. DC would definitely want join, awesome museums. Sounds like good plan. Wait, think people voluntarily going onto unemployment leaving jobs? went added 'fucking' 'vegetable'(uh, wha? brain dead?), apparently invested one.

Saying 'remarkably accurate *excluding*' portrays inaccurate, perfectly accurate statistics. ""Nate Sliver said ***wrong*** 2016"". wasn't. fanboy, lot shit political biases. math still good.  think showed hostility remarks towards Irish. Anyway, actually apologise irritable. usually mean provocative. bad mood unrelated reasons. comment first hearing ""positivity rate"". Become informed post. economist’s POV, Health bills actually good economy constitutes money movement, contributes GDP rate also increasing, increase testing, test positive % there's testing, hence, cases. good honest question. recent studies showing protests didn’t impact part. feel LA affected protests need data confirm.

The hardest hit states right (Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina) states didn’t shutdown entirely / reopened early / didn’t enforce face mask regulations. Florida specifically mocked nyc regulations great shape Florida seeing 8500+ new cases day. NY state peaked 11k, weeks lockdown.

Other cities tens thousands protesters (nyc, Chicago, Portland name few) aren’t seeing surges. data showing correlation lack regulations surge protests. supposedly hard make.

Yeah, [this must-read difficult produce remdesivir. took team seven chemists Taiwan several weeks work produce single gram order conduct trials. Shots fired(!!!) cases much longer that. It’s fine. We’re going fine. *Unda presha' doong doong doong da doong doong.....* Chinese likely already hacked research production process Gilead making own.

everything posted pretty much deflection peice. great. pray lot less useless humanity companies go put work fields actually positive impact. mechanics engineers going find better jobs. can't wait new fields come improve.

Hmm. Well sounds 100% accurate Yes stupid people everywhere. Stay safe. US lock put lotta people streets, running everyday, without masks, groups. flu. COVID deaths literally everywhere. suggesting one anything literally one person dying anymore?  Meaning making wage first place. unemployment extra put living wage. hate trying safe anything mock. really messed up. You’re probably right, I’d didn’t know information. Thanks. Sheeeeeiiit use steel sword fools. No, mate. *You* started putting interpretation onto post. talking purely reading graphs, took personal attack nationality. says something character. comes another concern there's news circulating coronavirus 'burning out' rising cases back April. keep seeing dangerous thoughts perpetuated, surprising leading non compliance resistance scientific data. meetup Tulsa bar, open cover.

2020 gives new meaning bar ""no cover"". Yeah actually, protests Toronto alone hit around 700k throughout city hundreds others country wide. would willing bet total number hit somewhere around 2 million dude, anything indoor closed space mandatory mask anything outside mandatory distance.
Europe contact tracing cluster lockdown-phase. infection isnt wide spread USA anymore cant compare logic are. made look like fools

Sure smoke longer hang time, exhaled &amp; transpired like viral load.  shocking thing many people replying didnt know this. y'all need expand horizons bit take blinders. theres whole world ideas think argument ""Hey, know large gatherings cause spread, important cause try protect protests."" Masks handed appears (as now) protests driving cause spike cases US. Let’s pretend people smart enough understand journal articles posted link. Bullshit, US bought one month one manufactures output. 

How many times BS going get posted?

There already 5 factory's making getting supplied underdeveloped nations cost. Europe US going pay it. positive % going atleast staying same? 

Wouldn't expect go simply testing? Yes? Again. pretty clear; huge protestor turnouts Canada (and fwiw, parts world too) however numbers community transmission actually *dropping* 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, going 4 weeks now... possibly say protests caused large part country refuses issue sort shutdown, physical distancing, mask mandate, etc? mental gymnastics everyone acting like somehow right things? huge spike cases early, one highest deaths/capita US (would like 2nd worldwide country), enjoying effects herd immunity. high-school diploma? Idk mean. take amount cases divide total tests day. got new new hes tv host whatever, shit would agree this. Atlanta boomers without masks state stark stance fear another flu since killing 0.01%. I’m really disappointed fabric culture. knew least selfishly independent, many spitting face collectivism. What’s worse hear boomers instructing teens young adults ignore news, little careful, mask social distancing needed among friends... Americans ruin year (or two) 90 days freedom. countries excluded list coronavirus infections rise: United States, Russia Brazil. Believe not, there's *even more* Massachusetts past Springfield.  Oh, bad. thought taking cheap, ineffective shots instead actually discussing topic. skip pointing native English speaker can't spell ""rebuttal"" correctly? Oh yeah, wrestlers ruin bodies don’t get health care need deserve so. Someone deep dive this...I can’t remember Patriot Act Last Week Tonight, heartbreaking infuriating. don’t think we’ve ever able trust numbers reported China. may never know true numbers infected dead. Trump right. I'm getting tired winning. Neither side wants admit fault end day everyone plays part. 

If go protest catch give 5 people go home see parents think B.S go shopping give 5 people going spread. one group person. virus care anyone's political beliefs. People seem fully grasp easier blame others ignorant. would've made ship go back hit iceberg twice, opposite side.

Never mind. sure downvoted, legit question.

I think main differentiator people wear masks events - protests - tend keep people safe. look shots people beaches, practically 0% compliance wearing masks. That, coupled fact people go beach 'sit around' (seriously, last time went beach that? go beach talk people, hang out, maybe drink alcohol supposed etc) get transmission that. Congratulations reassuring world U.S. still #1 everything. Act fast, act effectively sort problem. sounds like stupid government handling poorly me.mm fellow rhode islander

i think state proof damn seamless whole transition could nationwide. went phase 1-2-3 problem, got mask memo down, properly enforced right rules. like we've gyms beaches open months never saw spikes cases it, gina right way Rent car. $250 billion 1/8 CARES Act went unemployment insurance. would 'trillions.' full scale recession would far costly, interests prevent possible. Better ban Americans lol Wow something else.

Hahhaha, continent full’o’dummies. wasn’t chlorine solution provided almighty president? lol

So rest article exist? sending patients hospitals? - increased testing positivity rates increasing hotspot states - CA, TX, FL, AZ, etc English? places even see first. Yeah Cali NY phase 1 state literally businesses usual mask please? don’t really understand whole masks debate, country never made mandatory, enforced social distancing, basically 100 total deaths. funny thing US opportunity everyone else control thing. Europe reopening still little early responsibly, many asian countries imposed nationwide lockdowns know what? opening back normal now, ""new"" normal mind you, legit normal. 0 new cases.

(I'm severely asthmatic-odds particularly favour lol) it’s effective available everyone who’s willing take it, that’s good enough start me. That’s true. But, want claim protests spreading disease *at all*, need reconcile couple WebMD-level facts virus timeline.

Specifically, disease 5 day median incubation period, 95% going show symptoms becoming sick day 14 post-exposure. protests started 4 weeks ago, so, spike 2 week ms ago? want claim protests 2 weeks ago responsible portion spike, burden show different versus 4 weeks ago.  Everyone spreads virus it. question would protesting - could well caused even transmissions. Please share source data supports assertion. missing point. agree *should* shut virus control. wont happen. Yes know places shut shutting speak, end September certain start see “reopening” take place stay open, despite rising cases follow. would that?


Behind every politician policy-maker donors contributors make break politician policy-maker’s career. donors typically wealthy economic stakeholders. Right now, donors tolerating shutdowns 1) afford 2) financial stimulus helped buoy time being. work private equity seen first hand certain bills measures disappear right amount cash. 

But things continue shut down, corporate consumer debt defaults, consumer spending plummets, liquidity freezes... stakeholders start feeling pressure, put pressure policy makers politicians sustain economy activity means necessary. Lol, oh look another theory shot I'd fine viewed like that. loss words ones refusing wear masks actually cause problem they're making worse. Completely loss. mean part, mask wearers protecting people, hospitals treating people, everyone else burning thru savings stress-testing immunity. Literally country world argument itself.

Lol need right claim protests cause uptick without test results attended nothing declarative statement without taking account massive variables play. way someone could certain protestor could contracted virus protests somehow directly indirectly involved contributing recent surge cases around America. States like California example, massive protests... smashing record numbers daily cases. 

This anecdotal too, usually smoke, fire. *BUT MUH FREEDOMS!*

Did people pay attention high school civics classes? think people can't plain comprehend numbers. Even say ""only 1% die"", like realise much 1% earths population is? Even 1% packed football stadium, that's still massive amount lives people can't tale time think about.  Given many candidates already PII/PIII trials, I'm starting think Covid19 vaccine hard thought would oven. leave mask paper bag, sun (better) 3 days minimum, preferably 5+ days. use every day need 5+ masks rotate them. correct reporting potentially misleading. said, testing finds cases, means problem much larger previously thought. 

I tend believe CDC said - true cases probably 10 times data shows. LOT cockroaches, matter many rocks turn over. experts forgot mention real-cost get it. Mark words, Feb 2021 (and unlike now), many countries $crambling PAYING get it. still able get right mice tests on? reading special mice certain genes since normal mice can't get Covid. Yes job, rent end well people Yeah, caused lot confusion 3 months 120k people died repeatedly saying ""wear masks"" think stop blaming that. lag judging strategies way longer that. months still way judge Sweden's play right one.

I disagree. Well least ""right"" means ethical. think always unethical gamble try pursue herd immunity novel virus. talk potential amount [Disability-Adjusted Life (DALY), consideration may cause persistent and/or long lasting acute infection, consideration immunity may meaningful/durable, etc. always unethical. 

And also always unlikely [pay given amount also think highly unlikely Sweden's neighbors catch terms death toll. One Sweden's [most prominent experts, Björn Olsen, calling ""unthinkable. also think economic damage worse long term, especially since indications [1/3 survivors long term 

 one thing thankful it. need know whether countries contained summer contain winter. need know happens antibodies wear off. many countries going find first, Sweden able tell us second months anyone else.

I mean certain cold perspective sure. one loved ones Sweden hard maintain detachment. usually experiment called control group given treatment proven effective. think neighboring countries proving suppressing / Test, Trace, Isolate effective region. much better outcomes terms death toll, also least similar often better economic outcomes. say care lives,

They care economy,

They care staying power.

And stonks. Damn seeing makes feel disgusted America handled it. include politicians citizens. 1 5 minimum september  protest happened weeks lol. Everyone quarantined 1 new wave came on. I'm embarrassed party. Bunch hypocrites. ""You can't protest. going kill ppl!""

2 weeks later, protesting en masse 

2/3 weeks later cases start surging

Today, crying mess made freedumb tell me. idea. I’m repeating people believe. current cases returning residents isolation moment step planes Uh yeah... snort household dust

I'm trying stop, really. someone please get fuck Georgia?! Idc move I’m tired dealing south swear nothing brainwashed Trump loyalist whole virus hoax people. SOMEONE SAVE ME!!! Spanish flu mutated got worse time. deaf people read lips? Good job Massachusetts! One death tragedy. million deaths statistics. work retail store requires masks. It’s emotional mess. supply masks lots times people keen accepting wearing properly. daily deal folks remind wear properly, lots people getting irate rude it. Lots people argue us take frustration policy unwarranted opinions Covid co-workers, it’s exhausting. It’s selfish too. Luckily support company work able maintain maximum people time masks compared others area, grateful damn. 1% people US. Going route would take years. stockpiling placebo mean, yeah, easier non-religious people break religious taboos. realize suggestion, law, right? Replace COVID-19 Climate Change number major endemic crises assertion still 100% accurate supposed build enormous testing infrastructure lockdown. part reason lockdown. Tests available then, shit, even fraction need able properly contain shit. Weird, wrote something like another thread. live SoCal working class, lower middle income neighborhood. neighbor drives trash truck. houses route Tue. get done around lunch. parks front house lunch home day. still get house two people working blue collar. accept going old fixer upper.

What meant comment people always crap. Today, bad is, still far equal treatment women, minorities, gays atheists ""golden age"" America long shot. [I'll put rest understanding grave would like know also. bought neoprene masks would like know rank. favorite response dinosaur bones fossils.

of course, heard interesting responses question. sigh... Country music dead time! pricks political motivators. spies old job tell paying 5% every claim, covid dx not. think that's encourage correct reporting. shitty leaders covid-19

1) Rapid deployment effective vaccine fall
2) End Trumpism America
3) new piece random good news I'm kind weirdo listens bad pop country (I grew redneck,its guilty pleasure), even understand fellas stupid hell I’m Canadian rolled eyes much that. Fought wars moral grounds. Fought poverty impoverished. Like when??  Fauci wrong. speaking like things set stone. 

I flippant. edited comment make clear. deserve pay price well. child Emerald miners escaped collapse apartheid South Africa treats people like commodities? Say ain’t Bruh moment. leaders. 40% population. pace, US recording 100,000 positive cases per day August 22nd:

If poison neighbor, that's individual problem. handled individual level. consequences me.

But neighbor poisoned use well water additive studies say poisonous societal standards allow potentially poisonous additive sold without warning, that's systemic issue. policy sets public safety standard low.

That's saying. I've calling doc offices months, going one year, trying find primary care. Every time I'm running errands see doc office pop ask taking new patients, always nope. I'm snarky, I'm really struggling find primary care doctor taking new ppl. medical centers mentioned above, I'm worried emergencies. best internal medicine doc back home followed monitored every change minor diagnoses. miss level consistent care. I'm nursing school teachers classmates lot contacts practicums, etc... I've asked everyone know anyone taking new patients across neighborhoods mentioned. luck. Maybe there's website resource know don't? Dan Patrick faux Christian uses heighten “integrity” within political landscape. beliefs weighted money. doesn’t care individuals, sees consumers.

Exactly! wanted open bars restaurants would spend money there. said coverable populations stay home. they're like ""oh young people bars gave us Covid"" Yeah, think gonna happen!?

Gov: Spend?

people: ::get sick going bars::

Gov: SICK SPEND Sweden full EU member. Sweden included EU bit, Swedes travel countries EU.

Each EU member state set entry requirements non-EU countries. example, UK travel countries EU, Greece permit Brits entry happen, we're stuck Trump Biden matter point. Oh, that's quite lot, it? $962 including federal $600? long get state money happens that? something like safety net time runs out?

Interestingly, Germany, state almost give anything populace besides normal unemployment money. governments main focus seems companies helping keep people's jobs: Employers reduce hours state pay 60% missing income. idea companies reduce labor costs needed resume business usual staff things get better. pledge allegiance every day school starts, believe. Switzerland part EU... Nope. old office two years now. common systemic events reported 7 days vaccination BNT162b1 placebo recipients mild moderate fatigue headache.

Funny trick into. American voters always brightest. vote people know (popularity contest) rather qualified good policy. vaccine. Inovio literally stated press release participant 1.0 mg dose cohort two participants 2.0 mg dose cohort excluded immune analyses tested positive COVID-19 immune responses study entry, indicating prior infection. it’s fair, agree, work employer flexible, government failing us, empathize situation, teachers allowed teach remotely willing take risk kids don’t want go to, hybrid recognizes everyone’s concern fair thing guess doctor tells cancer listen, either.  Texan, Patrick speak me. idiot. one million+ people buy crap Developmentally delayed. two cent take: now, places, affluent able bunker avoid covid infection. That's going change. pandemic worsens, become increasingly difficult hide it. Rich people rely low-income domestic workers. workers going bring covid bunkers. Rich people go hospital. hospitals going filled covid+ patients. going another Hurricane Katrina mostly poor people suffer. going like 911 everyone suffers. going happen every major city get act together. Genuine question (not Floridasian, sure state country laws apply U.S.); could something along lines class-action (or proper equivalent) lawsuit state governments dereliction duty future?



If people experiencing potentially life-altering/shortening secondary issues C19 infection, lack response meant leading surely massively contributing factor. many countries they'd facing jail time effective dereliction duty national emergency.



It feels like seeing advertisements along lines mesothelioma ones not-too distant future. lesson world wars band together. Trading partners rarely go war. Countries diplomatic avenue (UN) less likely go war.


We leader US saying UN NATO trade agreements garbage. Brexit. China Russia going gain world influence this.


America played short game world wars. nice lasted, populace fat, stupid, lazy. guess beach, people hitting crowded indoor bars, restaurants, clubs. show called magicians
And amazing Fauci _not_ wrong. speaking like things set stone. said that, social distancing _was_ working, number cases _were_ going states _had_ gotten disease pandemic/epidemic levels levels starting die out. everyone decided best economy let grandma die reopened everything, cases started going up.

People act Fauci responsible baby-sitting entire nation dragging juvenile ass kicking screaming glory. citizens country can't responsible health, fuck health _advisor_ supposed half nation, including president, ignoring *_advice_*.

This like idiot burning hand low flame stove getting 1st degree burns. Fauci comes in, applies first aid puts bandages asks stay away stove says it'll heal 2 weeks. idiot takes bandages 1st week starts hurt less starts dicking around stove high flame. course going take longer heal time going hurt - gave 2nd degree burns, congratulations. Even working exercise degree caution. Going back work office retail setting puts increased risk, avoiding large gatherings, going concerts, going church, still considerably lowering risk. still lots older people taking great deal steps lower risk catching COVID. It’s isn’t nothing approach, even states throw things totally open, still going change activities pre-virus levels al gonna write in. Cause need write someone balot. Like us.... Cause biden isnt great cognatively. vp pres wins cant. trump needs go. So. need al get page pick someone write ballot form. Service Jobs definitely dangerous times. dont offer health insurance yet throw front lines paying enough stay alive afford bus ticket work. sucks, government leaders need realize this. south Korea government instituted mask rationing system could buy weekly allotment kn95 masks low price equivalent $1.20.

NYC subway selling similar protective quality $10 pop, wtf ~~comparable to~~ better Norway.

I literally havent come contact anyone wife since feb. vaccine probably approved another six months anyway NYC protest 50k Houstons. Go research. I’m sick idiots it’s even funny. least I’m COVID-19 sick like said idiots likely distant future, gone beyond ridiculous ccp get choose comments see there. Inflammatory win them. also system requires certain degree unemployment function.

If everyone good job, could boss fire you? would fill position? people wanted leave job.

Now employers would compete hire you.

You could demand sorts shit. Health care. Paternity leave. thirty hour work week. living wage. Affordable housing.

Heh, yea. People can't even convinced wear mask. sure I'd betting self imprisonment entire school going go well. :D can't even conversation dad granddad anymore without complaining ""government overreach"" ""infringing rights"" regards shutdown measures meant flatten curve. Conservative talk radio shows like F&amp;F poisoned minds - like can't critically think problem become politicized idols. isn’t. know someone coming back Florida tomorrow plans properly quarantine 14 days. Nice user name ;) fastest vaccine ever produced 5 years. 
We valid treason believe miraculously pull vaccine COVID faster. 
It’s better hope best prepare worst. Vaccines ramping phase three trial could theoretically approved November, ready distribution. don’t think quite year. Yes I’m taking account anti vaxxers. Well, unfortunately, looks like we'll find soon enough. Me, girlfriend, kiddo, father brother. Particularly since sounds like want get rid lot drivers anyway. Damn, remember people saying won’t pass 60k US? find detailed overview current situation Texas. Currently test positivity rate [13.56%](http://abcnewsradioonline.com/national-news/coronavirus-updates-texas-hits-record-8076-new-cases.html), way much troubling, since increasing. That's goal, necessarily are. Wired details it, frames 120m vials November Barda contract signed, company hired 123 additional employees track produce 40 million vials annually, according SiO2’s chief business officer, Lawrence Ganti. expects hire least 100 people ramp meet contract’s additional demands, include scaling 120 million vials November.

Which reads making 10m per year, scaled 40m per year, working get 120m per year. rates, many vials available given month. 

It sounds like take six eight months ramp production start hitting production challenge making vaccine itself, it’s filling vials. aren’t enough vials world,” Pascal Soriot, executive director CEO AstraZeneca, told reporters press briefing last month.   chain experts say booting new manufacturing site capable making additional 100 500 million vials per year take least six eight months. That’s glass vial makers get hands raw materials feed production lines

  idiotic. think printing money handing around makes recession somehow? There's less produced. output down. recession. think it’s couple dozen people going bars past weeks?

There tens thousands people bars restaurants every city allowed EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. that’s even riskier protesting inside eating/drinking (which means mask). NY biggest protest though? challenge find one protest 10k (6k Times Square largest saw) meanwhile, Houston protest? 60k. Yeah that’s I’m afraid of.

All big events summer canceled stay home. Absolutely! I’m rural middle TN. father-in-law last night “but death rates aren’t going up!”

I tell people understand risk low; however, I’d rather find out. 

I also work school system we’re plowing ahead reopen minimal precautions. know anyone contribute 401k. That's crazy. even contribute matching amount? hundreds coworkers Contribute Oh matters. Ffs need struggle passengers. driver pull over, stop car, refuse go further. saying NFL starts stops month later? 

You know pro soccer played right now, right? need tissue. wait, strip requires masks casinos, must mean casinos smoke free. 

Double win. USA thing everywhere else? problem already went peak haha. Late April worst numbers. People forgot quickly. south beginning first wave. northern part Italy great healthcare too.. Tfw literally 15 year olds make difference people need federal government continues go 🤷‍♂️ 

Outstanding job well done kids, source inspiration anyone stand make difference better so. need way good deeds like we’re going turn tables states I'm embarrassed American.. hope guys countries getting kind comedic relief watching us. :) ""been""

Glad see still got optimism! 

In fairness think UK heading way reopen weekend masks mandatory either.

Good luck would helpful know! still pictures up, they'd agree interviewed researchers! Stay strong determined, happening less across world different extents. people really gonna regret actions gets really bad exponential spread 50% good. But, increased testing according Miguel pence. anyone know normal hospitalization numbers look like time year? frame reference numbers want appropriately concerned. Yup. Karen want it, I'll glad take it. 4% fatality rate. sure that?

I distinctly remember seeing video Italian mayors castigating people outside. I'm never going forget right. headline usual click bait. read article, says: US government bought ***virtually entire production*** Covid-19 drug Remdesivir next three months.  US Department Health &amp; Human Services reached agreement drug's manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, purchase **all projected production month** and **90% production August September**.  **make drug unavailable Europe** **most** rest **of world**. Yes, was.

Let's see happens. someone lives US... yeah getting upvoted ?

I family people love worried cant even leave wanted.

And get downvoted saying i’m worried ? people problem world, fyi. think there's pretty easy, free drive-through testing site Dodger Stadium, 10 min downtown. coue friends went 2 weeks ago said easy-breezy

Or closed now? Go read comments woman friends bragging Facebook getting together large groups going places masks stir shit. America straining weight shitbags want everyone else suffer lives went rails. overpaid anyways sure got deleted feel free check post history. XXXXXX (Substitute name southern state) reports new single day high coronavirus cases. Reopening going well.  always wondered that's says song. Wtf key change? joke dumb people are? Joe Rogan fucking moron. think says whatever believes fanbase wants hear. Well here’s find concepts contradictory. Flattening curve exactly that. It’s mitigation tool, something use necessarily eradicate. virus widespread contagious unfortunately globalized. 

The word pandemic implies virus replicated beyond levels easy eradication. Without vaccine, avoid unnecessary death happened result strained healthcare system. death rate remain constant another X factor play (like vaccine effective treatment)

To sum easily: yes actually, slowing deaths longer period time ensure everyone received best care could received. Well least everyone wears masks stores, still like sneak quick buttfuck time time (get. Away. From. Me. Goddamn) It’s much willing pay. Premiums items get level 3 surgical masks, N100 3M N95... hospital systems get highest priority ... I’d imagine really asked it, they’d get it. Plus everyone nationally hearing Florida nonstop... could ask highest priority high priorities wish wrong, youre right. mandatory masks people ignore it. UIUC planning reopen backing despite rising cases.  Yup dorms area communal kitchens, bathrooms, showers, cafeterias. 100% worth especially times, huge time saver anxiety saver boot! Corpus we're closing off......VEHICLE traffic. People still free hit beach foot.

Our country great ain't greater global pandemic. also ditch baseball start cricket? Cricket way popular worldwide :p Every day new record. USA #1!!

Smh. I'm walking dogs cross street right (or move way side onto grass walking trail) people pass pandemic.

When minority that's approaching especially feel bad, want think behavior anything race, I'm cautious virus everyone passes. try wave say hi least, I'm sure that's enough. Yikes we're country now? .... new.... looked site check it, gave good trust rating Someone really needs create ""Yelp"" type app businesses follow proper protocols require masks. would happily support businesses look public health. talking about? knew pandemic went protesting.
And still went out. doubled infections America prior protests.
Media done thing arrogance America overcomes Wanna bet? Young people get sick, spread it, would expect delay. didn’t. know didn’t. it’s cool. Keep do0mer ignore Science. Doesn’t matter virus ending whether want believe not.. Listen, get wear masks grocery shops (in country no-one sell u smth u without masks gloves). trying explain rely simple paper masks. u want protect use reliable materials. u provide researches could prove capability simple masks protect us? Even decide paper masks useful. IFR estimate proper medical care. Something like 5% infected need serious medical intervention. think say 5% would _all_ die, definitely add another million. Good point, number grocery stores CA delivery touchless curbside pickup. Boom roasted actually referring Europe. Worse, there'll likely pandemics scale future crisis accelerates. hard feel pretty bleak all. We're apparently good job learning lessons that. maybe we'll start figure late. Happy cake day! Alberta...the alabama Canada. necessary either. 1918, would throw ass jail counties wearing. constitutional law changes necessary.


The abstract ethics legality mask wearing irrelevant, health economic outcomes matter. third world country.

I list dozen top head done better. sure comment contradicts mine. Great, we’ve become poster child now... [Student athletes allowed get paid use name, image likeness... effective Oct. 29,2019 you, insist. wont stay 100k new cases per day. something go higher. History says three waves look influenza pandemics base. 2ed one worst. Took 2.5 3 years tops. cost grim. Well cases keep rising, hospitalization keep rising too. means runs eventually unless suddenly discharge people faster. federal local administrations change criteria covid-19 deaths keep number low. find rules? many deaths? seeing many. Livestream social distance concert YouTube. Watch listen safety couch, drink shitty beer. important ensure health care workers masks, supply chain changed know COVID-19 transmission. 

Reasonable people hold different opinions different times.   protests happen.

massive spike cases 

ban contact tracers asking covid patients they've protest.

blame everyone protesters rising covid cases get that? That’s never case. Thursday Friday’s biggest case days since, forever next step 2020: mass weaponized autism. Yeah, theory. big corporations argue act God unforseen natural disaster?

There's currently class-action lawsuit Enterprise handled Remember REOPEN ECONOMY WEAR MASKS ECONOMY? LOL. ambulances, big deal.

In couple weeks, refrigerator trailers, that's know TSHTF. Looks like got us fatality boards set up. Thanks, anti-Science people. get that? That’s never case Yea Next, looting rioting said anti-mask fools. Americans fucking loud, obnoxious, dominant large influence whole rest world thinking. Yea country systematic problem government actually do. US never faced problem couldn't, effect, Trump way through. luck ran finally.  get paid enough deal shit. Thank you!! Awww! mean isn’t good news, media makes seem like deaths going cases going up. seems they’re portraying worse clearly isn’t case... yet. This. pols dumb can't see this. also can't see voter sentiment change things get bad. Maybe drastically, enough end fools' careers. I'm guessing intentional infection virus parties, sorta like people used chicken pox parties young children BTW, absolutely STUPID Idea!  Hm also compare state state here: data publicly available covid data:  lack 7th grade understanding percents work, misread data CDC, tell us understand science? True, bring everyone Last country herd immunity's rotten egg! No. Flattening curve slowing growth overwhelm hospitals. Also give time get testing tracing capability place. 

Getting R0&lt;1 getting point could plan reopen. point you’re bending curve downward. Come hang little tourist destination mountain town everyone town like nothing happening theyre mostly Texas. know, place literally exploding Corona. personally seen stores fighting wearing masks following social distancing guidelines. live one places Govenor talking personally see literal thousands cars white (texas) red (rentals) license plates coming 285 70. live kindly fuck off. 

Bonus: Protip, drive hill Friday go Sunday.  difficult, Indian pharmas could still make quite lot could bothered follow QC. would you?

But deaths attributable misunderstanding masks situation? last laugh opinion changed fire nation attacked  But...what rights /s. tell jump lake. Yes, whole world recovering slowly reopening, US said ""Ain’t nobody got time that"" they’re back start, wasn’t trump saying reopen economy cost lives? “Our country wasn’t built shut down,” “America will, again, soon, open business. soon. lot sooner three four months somebody suggesting. Lot sooner. cannot let cure worse problem itself.” Back March. California plans reinstate stay-at-home order Texas, Arizona, Florida restrict things. Anyone else sense pattern can't say loud stupid bot? 2 options:

1. Vaccine alleviates fears

2. People accept risk move on

Frankly, disease gonna us forever, may well learn deal move on. would imply growth rate linear, isn’t exponential?  either blame China Europe outbreak. WHO, Bill Gates 5G  Oxford vaccine actually started arm Brazil week. 99.99% major conditions

At least AZ 30-40% (estimate: [AZ's tracked age cohorts hospitalizations 50. admitted, I'd call major. Minor moderate cases sent home can't breathe. reports AZ hospitals sending inpatients home early oxygen since need space.

Doing quick math 2.3% (1 50) cases 50 end serious/major conditions (hospitalized). far numbers. Yes, that's special protesters.

That question whether protests led spike difficult questioncompared simplistic analysis offered person responding to.

I think violently agreeing me.

Getting people admit protesting somewhat problematic, accuracy test would wildly questionable. basically asking people admit potential crimes depending district attorneys locations protests took place. would able accurately assess protester involvement.

So could magically test protesters would get accurate results, that's going happen test purported test protesters directly would error bars Ying Yang. Exponential growth means change behavior, it'll 10.000 month, behaviors changing, could couple thousand less, likely going lead situation people get care left die. think follow logic. EBP ""[the integration best research evidence clinical expertise patient Surely see 3 cornerstones referring 3 different things implied mutually exclusive?

Normally, i'd agree rest comment general. specific case covid-19 however, I'm sure do. think fairly clear fact esteemed medical establishment managed predict treatments covid19 symptoms general expertise healthcare indeed virology translate well expertise regarding specific virus.

Yes, realize general expertise sped research new virus significantly, context hand expert opinion absence research evidence. context, seems little use. (because research evidence, think agree research evidence needs looked at)

 

 TL;DR: i'm saying expertise virology useful period(clearly speeding research). However, see empirical proof expertise necessarily translates useful conclusions absent research.

(excluding ofc conclusions imo stems common knowledge, like physical barriers physical distance work prevent virus spread) also live rural PA, people area either wearing masks it, ""infringes liberties,"" think corona real gotten sick family members haven't. awesome. might something Shen Yun....  Outmoded lines thinking take long time overcome. Also, layer middle management lot companies whose sole job ""keep everyone working"". managers need worried. producers. accurate tests? pretty much since start pandemic. never gave shit still don’t. typo Sharing, **is**, fact, caring. please somebody take book, either biology, medicine even history (ideally one plagues) smak it? I'm usually fan violence books one would greater good. Man, pandemic freaks out. immunity weak everywhere dangerous, serve military can't bar in. Hopefully it'll come soon, I'm sick paranoid every mild cough.  blame friends neighbours. politicians get appointed. elected. I'm willing bet number friends voted blue state governor pretty fucking low. reality it’s probably both. think another lesson 2016 Russians get ball rolling happy keep pushing along ourselves. thing sucks us already know hes idiot lose family get sick well. matter wearing seatbelt give two shits. Yeah ""only"". Regulating people coming island country 1000 miles anything else globe quite easy. US thousands people coming borders unchecked every day. Many times population NZ, much commerce. Fair question, nitpick, I’d say set bar somewhat “overwhelmed ICUs” far flattening curve. wearing mask sucks, it’s worth certain circumstances. Theres numbers article, evidence backing title.  Nucking futs. also lowest positive rate yet (0.5%). Obviously go every day look trends. week ago 122.

Unfortunately, takes time need 5-10x production setup now. BI federal government expects domestic surge capacity vials next three years,"" HHS spokesperson told Business Insider, adding companies ""have performance period three years potential options extending agreement ten years.""

So expecting take additional scale years get distributed. damn true. First, start saying infectious disease experts agree you. twitter feed dedicated experts instance case protesters, total number protesters one protester might fact could quite low well resulting spike could quite high. Protesters families, take Ubers, eat, go grocery shopping on.

So non-protesters. That's special protesters differentiating factor. That's disease spreads. measure groups without sorting all, cannot say kind accuracy spread. test groups *and know went protests not,* spread happened protests, would expect rate positivity among people tested *you know protested* higher. studies *by infectious disease experts* done found high rates covid infections people protested. Yes, protesters could spread people, non-protesters do. also yes protesters might contracted something protesting. Clearly something get protesting spread protesting. many contracted protests? precisely know that. best way get handle test population assume every case came protests, relatively small compared activities states protests already reopened. 

* Tests protesters finding rates much higher background rate disease.

* Areas protests finding higher cases without. NYC massive protests, cases continued fall. 

* States mandate masks increasing cases, average, states without mandating masks decreasing cases, average.

* Protesters dwarfed number people ordinary activities.

* States reopened restaurants, bars, massage, hair, nails, high risk activities many states mandate masking. 

* Contract tracing around world shown spread rarely happens outdoors.

* Contract tracing tells us indoors, without masks, prolonged contact best way spread bulk transmission.

* Far people engaged activities much likely spread due factors protested.

* Taking together strongly suggests protests significant vector covid transmission.

Yes, modeling disease hard. matters try tease risks. happening scientists around world good idea kinds activities variables lead transmission. protests outdoors, masks, social distancing. relative spread come far less ordinary indoor activities indoors, without masks, prolonged contact. relative numbers participants two activities unlikely protests responsible much spread. available data tells consistent story. know, we’re lucky. pay thorough teeth taxes wouldn’t want way, wouldn’t alive weren’t NHS. 

You friend, stay safe. idea long delay is? Um else going do, actually work deal feelings, exercise take new hobby?? Nah dawg need Fireball 10 cent wings! county way many people doubling denial. People keep posting friend nurse doctor works lab hospital telling “know fact” positive tests faked. People continue say Covid-19 liberal hoax. continue insist virus “just like cold.” announce wear mask, practice social distancing, “live fear.” posts—this weapons-grade ignorance stubbornness—is horrifying. I’ve staying home since March 4th looks like I’m going able leave home time soon. Stupid stupid does. Trump would gone college, entirely possible science biology education received would prepared better. Also, problem Trump education level. problems Trump clearly articulated trumpeted last election. Also, still lot educated people covid deniers.  Im sure original comment implying lower test counts would lead positive rate staying flat. Unless Florida changed strategy, less tests doesnt inherently create change percent positive, per capita stat reliant total number tests done. turns wrong get fired Harvard? It’s safe go restaurant northeast. someone correct i'm wrong. I'm reading Italy 6,000 new cases day around peak. going worse even though Texas smaller population? It’s like, last ICU bed, don’t code anyone age 90. don’t specifically write new rule down. abide it. another bed opens up, go back full code everyone. thing blood shortages. let trauma patients get lot hypotensive hang blood try preserve resources. It’s becomes lot unwritten rules. Second peak completely different first. huge unknown number cases festering weeks testing capacity caught up. New cases late first round initial rise captured quickly now.

Iran's country go second peak second peak deaths following increase new cases death curve started rise month behind new case curve.

Also Texas Arizona deaths already started rise. Texas Lt. Governor statement today really shit cherry top all. far between. 

I've seen lot crimes buses taken care normal people bus (someone trying take purse old lady guys door grab throw next stop). looked quoting, said ""~50% cases"". one spreading misinformation. fucking idiot. Stay friggin Reddit keep date things nationwide. Regular news sources suck lie.

Dude reddit one **worst** possible places exclusively get information from. legitimately Fox News.

Take random person reddit a:

* 50% chance American
* 80% chance white
* 75% chance male
* 75% chance 30 younger
* 65% chance bachelor's degree higher education that

So think it... majority content prioritized (by upvotes) based views white, male, American, young adults/teenagers/children COURSE certain biases attached that. 

This website's formula ***LITERALLY*** hides things demographic like it.

Not that, website filled brim fickle, hypocritical know-it-alls create false personas convince people experts things avoid losing argument (*cough*... /u/Unidan).

I know industry subreddit, mine does, ton angsty morons spewing straight false smokescreen technical terms understand order convince people certain companies evil ones benevolent insane nonsense like that.

Social media places like breed fear mongering fanaticism extreme reactions, know reddit excels crap. Look abusrd way people act current issues. circle jerk straw men stereotypes shaming insults whining little-to-no productive communication.

So yeah... reddit perks everything, great place find new news sources, **ONLY** place someone getting information extremely uneducated biased (and probably immature af lol). people ignoring symptoms, avoid going hospitals stroke heart attacks. 

I’m sure plenty extra suicides drug overdoses also. Don’t forget murder NYC. 

It’s big assumption assume 100% excess deaths Covid.

Plus know ‘excess deaths’ 3-yr avg deaths, going natural variation yr yr. Need test statistical significance. like watching annoying movie plot way predictable.

If Americans keep this, rest world cut vacations years come. 
It’s highly unlikely vaccine within two years.

Edit: typo

** round 2 also tested South Africa US August. existed we'd probably them. Like pee pee tapes. pay real cheddar those? share, right? woop woop Texas physician here. Yep, way folks icu floor covid March April. 50-75% more. folks younger. first wave 60-80. almost half 30-60 median early 60s. 

On bright wide, I’m smaller Texas town/city I’ve seen face mask use tick significantly since beginning. less half, consistently 2/3
Or . Still good enough better  Reddit always comes rescue landlords. know they're boomer-run corporations evict small children laugh it, **if enough money point put payment non-essential property plan finance person live pay slightly less cost mortgage, repairs, property taxes without getting ownership, livelihood, investment.** tenants dire straits cannot pay rent, response compassionate instead point binding lease signed COVID-19 even map, business, expect consequences business. **As far remember, one entitled risk free investment.**

They source income likely fine. made investment, market turn way liked. client can't pay rent, use savings upkeep mortgage, they're insanely irresponsible property owner, evict sell property, pay remainder mortgage, move on. take loss property.

Landlords always megatycoons, playing game smaller scale. investment allowed fail? I'm talking throwing landlords street. I'm talking normal, mostly upper-middle class people decided make investment failed. **If risk part investment, rich always get richer, money guarantee money.** Bexar County seen huge uptick cases last couple weeks. now, took month half reach 1,200 cases. county sits 12k Can't imagine people Mexico must go right now. 

50% !?!?!

That insane... Well that’s shitty feel trapped. it’s even shitty expose countries potential outbreaks US did/is bad job handling this. 

Don’t travel don’t to. things don’t pay healthcare talent? believe NYC's success less they're re-opening much virus squashed re-opened. Flatten curve always strategy herd immunity, intentional not. get rid virus, going spread. Masks help, enough. welcome!

A large amount salt general curing salt particular bad idea either, let preserve food. 

Basically try look people survived long harsh winters 200 years ago start there. Tech tools come next. According worldometer (not reliable source, know) Egypt even worse. Oklahoma wants fight it. Mayor said beaches shut cannot afford lose revenue states hind-sight 20/20. 

Basically, short response is: Oh, well.” Yikes. Department Health Human Services said Mr Trump secured 500,000 treatments drug September, representing 100 per cent Gilead's July production capacity 90 per cent capacity August September.”

Unsurprisingly, Trump size-able investment them. Dick move, stock up, Trump made money, parade something thing care about: re-election, drug limited use gave middle finger rest world. Yet nothing happen, that's owns $100,001 $250,000 worth Gilead stock Deutsche asset management account $250,001 $500,000 account can't understand simple example, maybe really get it. way look it, masks win cost-benefit. fucking ridiculous. Letting someone car without mask letting someone car pants + draws on. health hygiene issue!

I want bare ass car want nasty uncovered mouth either! Thanks, good news.  Sure hell Kelvin 😅😅 bad ""flu"" season say.  Texas counts confirmed positives months ago.

You 100% wrong.  US administration making China look better better everyday.

... reddit-correct, China BAD. /r/butlerPA checking in! Desire masks there, vastly outnumbered. Good Wolf. Arizona. They've started ""crisis care"" standards, basically meaning triage. critical cases get priority, course, deemed unlikely survive denied care. dominate gold medal count summer, focused attention next best thing. Breaking world records. Virus basically gone northeast. 0 100 new cases per day 20% nursing homes. Downvoted Weinberger's intuition fits narrative science irrelevant. Well country got control via actual effective lockdown, America didn't, America stubborn lockdown effective manner, happy medium people trying come get things control again.

Masks scientifically proven reduce transmission disease. reverse outbreak? Probably not, least may slow it. tiny sacrifice, even 5% efficient (it that), would worth it.

Also, people Europe wearing masks. I've seen plenty videos many different countries. Canada, I'd say 50% people masked grocery stores live.  sounds nice lol. wish something similar U.S. alas, don’t. wish best stay safe fellow kidney transplant friend.  “All hotspots”. Yes hotspots consisting people aren’t nearly susceptible symptoms. get virus eventually. horrors. Floridian here. 2 days 9000 cases think slowed testing make numbers look low. We’re fucked know vote terms pandemic response... Cuba? Cuba representative? I've gotten habit saying Praise Lortabs, can't quite kick it. Kick saying that. lortabs themselves.

I like cut pause hard T, ""Praise Lort---abs."" bit judgemental bud. I'm completely aware risks that's I'm staying home unless necessary. cannot control people I'm cut father wanted visit family, decided travel restrictions placed. well damn, need sort flu pandemic then. probably put mask, social distance, stop going bars, shit Yes damn thing it.  FUCKING IDIOTS broke social distancing rules go riot ""protest""  made laugh. :)  little question, rogan says one listen musk comes science politics? find anything google appreciate comment straight Bill Gates PR firm.

I need Bill Gates making health decisions me. history businessman tyrant. old enough know reputation dating back 30 years people worked him.

He rich person decided protect wealth opening foundation targeted number things hold dear hobby. 

Bill Gates believes way correct always ways. He's rich donchaknow must know everything. 

Bill Gates agenda, money make world playground, certainly plans alive see chosen experiment goes.

I'm interested. us bought entire supply anyway.

I hope generics start making now. sounds amazing! may try uptickwouldn't immediate, protests, would show statistical graph weeks later people got sick. nothing testing protesters. rate people show hospital two plus weeks event.

contagion rate indirect indicator contagion, test sick infected uninfected weeks potential exposure.

one reasons expect much uptake would masks. People already wearing masks disease plus wanted wear masks stupid tear gas. know masks highly effective parties wearing potential transmission scenario.

To fully appreciate entire question understand delay means analysis. That's I'm worried July 4th. We're already gonna pushed brink, that's push us far beyond people take precautions. got right Unless monkey. want monkey ebola-Reston Woosh shit going around facebook Okay, I'm going break bad inferences made claim protests cause uptick without test results attended nothing declarative statement without taking account massive variables play.

EVEN test results attended, able say caused uptick unless knew results would OTHERWISE.

For instance, may that:

1. protestors generally likely kind people otherwise take virus seriously, areas high populations types people generally experience lower spread. Yes, spread might greater otherwise, even necessarily true because...
2. Attending protest, obviously high risk, might make people likely decide self-isolate afterwards, result might contribute less spread instead spent following 3 weeks going stores visiting friends family, etc.

YOU one oversimplifying this, me, considering one side equation way someone could certain protestor could contracted virus protests somehow directly indirectly involved contributing recent surge cases around America.

This charlatans cope actual data (such OP's article) proves wrong, try muddy waters basically suggest, ""Well evidence, mean I'm wrong. simply cannot know evidence would prove right, nothing convince I'm wrong this.""

But aside, pretty good idea comparing cities counties based protests occurred didn't. article did, read like California example, massive protests... smashing record numbers daily cases.

California largest population US state. Even tiny uptick cases that's proportionally SMALLER uptick states going appear large number thousands. Different perspectives based experience :)

My experience doctors PhDs rather MDs falls research side. read ""the doctors"", inferred medical scientists review necessary, replicate results trials, OP referring to. 

But sure *didn't* mean MDs, hedged quotes. I've trying actually get doctors create curriculum goals

Based experience MCLE requirements lawyers, need convince state licensing authority impose CME requirements. They'll never impose upon themselves. fining driver's license. Goldman Sachs weighed I'd say chances went least 5% dear leader consider wearing mask. Personally read comments get better representation headline. BLM protests cause uptick can't concerts outdoor sporting events masks on. Didnt also like millions dead? Texas plan reverting back stay home orders? money money money money moneyyyyyyy money Listen Italy, know best. always learning share info.

And people tolerating it. trust Fauci.

Do trust he's saying opposite said then? Since haven’t responded I’ll assume reading here’s correct information anyone else reading.

Here’s info believe anything dumb ass Trump says. Verify everything. Reddit skews young, privileged, educated. Back April, cases per capita U.S. did. Yeah lot people driving since border shut still community spread Biggest lie ever. case let everyone world gather BLM protest we'll saved COVID.

Viruses give fuck anything political agendas. really depends much taken hold rural areas weekend. tell overwhelming majority places defiant masks staying in. disaster there's enough infected people there. Oof 127 poor middle-income countries, Gilead allowing generic makers supply drug; two countries around $600 per treatment course.  sympathize owners. It’s right state shut down, deserve compensation. Making eat cost pandemic (and particularly terrible decision making states) grossly unfair. God forbid public policy follow scientific evidence.../s
it’s inconceivable can’t grasp central role government promoting health safety. can’t see virus doesn’t mean ignored! I’m thankful avoid confined indoor spaces people ...I can’t imagine wanting go one pandemic. Somehow unemployment benefits ran 3 months, instead helping people, gave money billionaires. America fucked. possible protests led non-protesters staying home, thus reducing total number people exposed one another? Suuuure ...

Edit: moving average Uneducated people feel superior important listen people earned authority, people degree etc. feel ""this high mighty person degree begging something save people's lives, lmao I'm gonna ignore show world chad am"". don’t know intentions, I’ve witnessed actions. fellow masshole. I’m optimistic, people seem keeping up. like think smug sense state pride keeps people working towards controlling this. Keep good fight, neighbor. Yes it’s notion started first place.. recipient person felt need to.Yes person donate (if that) bullshit entails. Proper thing would ask shut tell people donate cause rather them. blame people rush reward mostly. inadvertent recipient. Again, whole problem gofundme it’s often misuse.  Yeah, answering primary questions speaks volumes. truly hope end menu. like racists supposed die along time ago? Lol wishful thinkin mate, people stay better education boggles mind college football stadiums bigger NFL stadiums non essential work minimum wages? Again, part point don’t actually want people work right now. universal basic income would better solution, IMO That's knee slapper Huh sadly hes kinda right place earth genius people idiots living side side. Science must hard understand. Making statement corona barely deadly flu season idiotic. Corona already killed 500k people worldwide. virus wasn’t already seeded countries around world. 

You also can’t discount many die things already sick things. 

Fact counties modern health care virus killing almost 130k people months serious. Saying otherwise idiotic. Well, know what, maybe second iceberg would plug hole made 1st one ! disagree, think exaggerating. 

The USA flaws sure, they're still first world country generally high quality life. good as, say, Scandinavia, Scandinavia ""a benchmark failure"" many intermediate steps. 

As fact US seen ""benchmark failure"", keep importing aspects US culture Western Europe, try emulate policies ideologies. Regardless whether stuff like (they're usually not), many European countries institutions still look US esteem high enough this. now. sucks! 

I agree need roasted need plan leadership top, 4 years nothing stonewalling certain group past 30 so. get vote, get friends vote. vote, vote folks actually beat assholes voice say policy actually matters. China safe list? I'm beginning see Trump's rational covering numbers. *It acts recommendation EU members, meaning could, potentially, individually set restrictions entering 14 nations.* 

At moment, change. nation lift restrictions see fit. thats hyperbole. like think civilised population capable wearing masks without forced Well, first off... typing involve wind.

Secondly, since directly influence POTUS - Trump even WWE Hall Fame - actually matter. US FUCKING guess Undertaker coming retirement all...

I'm saying social distance lock time.

The less human contact better. Troll you’re eligible state unemployment, eligible $600/week.

But course, I’m saying someone ineligible both, apparently. still can’t get anything I’m starting hear recipients notified fraudulent- I’m glad didn’t try. $1,200 helped two months, I’m relying friends family. Soon I’ll streets. Dude, Corona 6 months old killed 500k worldwide 
Your tripping balls dude.
By numbers, Corona par malaria, surpassed war numbers. already 3rd tb numbers.
The infection rate Corona compared black death spanish flu literally charts comparison.
You really need reality check. US saw comment r/Republican yesterday claiming uncommon average liberal burn American flags hating U.S. hallmark left. gobsmacked someone could legitimately believe first part annoyed understand second part. responded such.

Yeah, lot us hate state country right shit shape, mean literally hate America. still pretty solid freedoms many countries let enjoy, institutions pretty fucked many operate days.

Blind patriotism frustrating witness. wouldn’t want like us? We’re number 1! 

/s see, suck makes suck suck. Covid triggered vascular problems hands feet... back February. I'm still suffering issues now. recent bloodtest showed Covid antibodies... 4 months it. Yea unfortunately would actually work set highway checkpoints state lines. We’d need someway tracking entry exit times. like could let people come back force quarantine (or least let exit 2 weeks). really long winded way saying fact matter? Straw man. can’t leave first place Australian (and definitely legit numbers), know USA lot testing necessarily mean numbers ""legit"". heaps reports different places around US actively concealing numbers, trump saying asked people less tests withdrew funding testing centers.. yeah, 'only country legit numbers'.... /s thought strange went 9k 5k single day clock simplest recognisable visual metaphor time? 3000 dollars insurance worked Healthcare company expert could ask questions. asked ""why healthcare one expensive world per unit care?"" one coworker piped ""because BEST, woo!"".

Obviously, representative everyone, culture ""we wrong"" seriously hindering improvement. often ordering burgers Burger King 8 AM? Love username exactly I’ve feeling. stay home, wear mask bombarded “but faith save me” crowd every day. fleeting moment thought rising numbers mask requirements would change minds, nope. Apparently Tuesday night bible study pastor’s home public enough anyone wear mask. going see many needless cases. 3 domestic cases?  That's good news! soon Vacation Coronavirus says
""I'll back"" It’s matter good it. think privileged. Japan advantage citizens wearing masks slightest reason even Covid, though. It’s societal norms helped individual behavior. China new swine flu thats hit Countries lock five cases Ebola. think China shuts entire provinces five cases COVID-19, delusional. Clearly never 3rd world country. America absolutely 1st world Vince McMahon matter?

Yet another billionaire US give shit employees (see also Jeff Bezos Elon Musk). wife former head US Small Business Administration Trump, current chairwoman America First Action, pro-Trump Super PAC love use Kazakhstan make numbers rosy?

Why use metric many tests carried want assess current situation? US #5 daily tests per million. favorite Kazakhstan #13. UK #18. statistics would’ve updated Swedish numbers last week Sweden would #19 sits #23 June 21st. 

Norway never high Sweden right now. Sweden high Italy highest. Germany tests less current outbreak. 

Are sure don’t Sweden=bad glasses on?

What like dislike much Kazakhstan? provided full protection SARS-CoV-2 replication lungs mice challenged virus&lt;
OK, replication air ways? Hmmm think moment removes Fauci, lot people go apeshit, discard countrywide protests again.

Doubt it. would lot blowback talk online cable news, ultimately he'd get away real consequences. Yeah trust us either Whataboutism. Best what? Lol Belgian prime MinisterS health say mask ""are highly advised, wearing break laws."" call trump bad... Keep eye belgian news. Might well posted directly /r/jokes  Gross. first. global perspective, UK relatively quite safe now, China much safer EU countries. mean, though months ago....just maybe... Joe Rogan one guests covid tested appearing podcast? Hi Arnold, 

You rock. 

Cheers opposed people relaxing otherwise chaotic time period? Nobody asked this. miss working. miss job clients (massage therapist) feeling productive. Like seriously hell dude? 

Is one things feel miserable life believe everyone else appear miserable times? you’re speaking language. Unfortunately, governments always product people. apathy, perhaps, are. Oh come on. There’s always demand someone get knees work. interesting read, know HEPA filtered. article state 1/2 incoming air fresh 1/2 recirculated (though filtered). 

A new question arises though, frequently HEPA filters cleaned/replaced? airlines well-known penny pinching misers (cheap uncomfortable seats, packed give leg room, extra fees carry-ons), etc. ust read woman. Years ago kooks lot entertaining. internet makes say crazy stuff. used creative. years since saw good crazy person getting thought control waves beamed heads fron light sockets. ""forced vaccinations"" ""mark beast"". Good luck. People protested first lockdown. think they’ll allow second one? confirm. aunt leaving Amazon boxes garage 72hrs. would wipe bleach. first pandemic hitting US. government started saying going take precautions do, flipped. government trying control us hoax. I’m getting by, city hasn’t hit hard yet, California I’m mentally preparing! Dunno. say take container put plate - don’t touch washed hands. Yeah don’t think undergrad law degree even thing.  still remember hit 100k cases month. per day.

Fix hearts America Jesus Christ. know majority you, rate, matter. course it’s good idea. walk there. agree dont know feel like county stopped reporting couple months ago—they werent taking zip codes testing sites didnt needed count county roster. dream world they'd conduct home saliva test pay infected people stay home. one thing sitting classroom. quite another field, literally ingesting roar across ball snapped.

50% infection rate probably low.  Thank you! That's _want_ us think. read comment intended. comment directed Karens using peoples' burdens justify even slightest amount help end sooner. cut 3 zeroes. actually covid19000. interest convincing masks favor masks. said, somewhat ambivalent comes government enforcing use masks. huge distrust government general. sure riots, burglaries, theft similar.  Yeah except cases NJ continue decrease, despite far densely populated state country. maybe they’re something right? Lol I'd post gfm. ""Reddit woman self doxes. Loses job.""

And it'll get posted sub.

And one would donate they'd call dumb. hairnet great face mask material? woulda thunk it. Thanks Florida Atlantic University diligence commitment. lot go ape shit, unheard people need hear it. stay filter bubble happens family themselves.  would known? /s remember briefly believed early on, also. We’re really own. left us flappin Georgia 13.6% hospitalization rate confirmed cases. Australia also fewer people state California lot space. death amount low compared nyc peak time Shut down. Social experiment over. people can't trusted. Cuomo too. contingency plan, want use need case do. Thankfully NY hopefully AZ need either. hope people forced take things seriously, yes. choose lives dies. Paying what? people come jobs well minimum wage taking one keep roof heads. Need stop think vast majority homes even rents sustainable minimum wage job. saying rich people maybe lower middle. importantly fault company worked saw dip decided let go appease shareholders. 

What want see homes abandoned foreclosures ultimately banks holding notes them. Absolutely reason people streets trillions dollars sitting accounts nothing privilege few.

I'd personally okay people fighting back think see nothing gets done stop it. People forgotten last disaster okay another go around. Floridas odd testing goes.


I say odd, side effect weekend (less people working test center). countries region similar pattern, everyone use 7 days rolling average nowadays. likely guy #2 get infected since virus suspended air inside micro droplets.

The risk outdoors much smaller since wind instantly diffuses droplets. Yeah takes pretty strong stance this. claims would possible vaccine coronaviruses already one SARS MERS. listened first came hope I'm misstating position seemed think financial incentive develop vaccine. seem think particularly difficult technical hurdles way. lack effort due taking seriously able make money vaccine. Pretty excellent education massive contributor. education really spreads aspects society. Healthcare, technical innovation, standards living etc

 (This say Massachusetts perfect massive systemic issues like everywhere else, gotta take W can.) wash hands, social distance, wear mask go out....but confusing people become political. let scientists lead. EDIT: edited post add word “minor” previously claimed “a law degree” (but wasn’t lawyer)


Haha, don’t. You’ve already claimed something else ENTIRELY previous conversations. 


You claimed minor law, that’s fucking law degree lmao 


I 100% confidence degree all. Well that’s completely separate issue. perfect world, would fair distribution wealth small businesses would receive help now. However, that’s case, keep businesses shut everyone else knows able make unfair. so, think risk overblown people easily able dismiss things like kids needing go back school. I’ve heard sex tourism medical tourism? Hmm like 9 years we'll immune! pragmatically agree, society gotta get point depend strangers health. Well, happen 700 years maybe TMC 100% ICU capacity Friday Exactly this. CA. stupified moved phases reopen quickly. wait weeks phase see ramifications absolutely infuriating. family locked 3 months. limited essential activity trips only. Everyone working learning home, two small children educate entertain, everyone trying stay sane. thrown window charged ahead reopen. NY issue extra ICU beds enough nurses trained critical care. It’s dangerous situation patients nurses. ""luck"" 

\*sighs science\* Wow, bad seen coming. world less testing means less positive cases, suppose could say people die, less positive cases be. love roast duck. Thanks putting head I'm already home night. Yeah, ya see that’s kicker understand perfectly. ever poor? ever choose paying rent eating? Hard buy something nothing, nothing taken. lack effort. Yeah people like problem. Hug money night cunt. invest things like house, IRA, retirement account? mutual fund someone else stock game you, right? Uh, earphones work aren’t stupid. coworker sounds stupid though. Music makes world better. recent Jilin, Beijing, Harbin outbreaks tells China top whack-a-mole game. got science.

Well done! point it’s 50+ crowd thinks term “millennial” sounds young doesn’t know “gen Z” yet. millennial friends married 30’s pretty much houses and/or children. Oh god ❤️ doing? Omg want e hug you. Finding health care socs wild Reddit wild. remember, back late May/early June, sub, people pointing ""reopened"" states like Georgia, Florida, Texas, saying things like, ""lol where's spikes? doomers gonna keep saying 'wait two weeks' like always""

Well, are. Turns half-assed measures actually work well. realize returning means income, unemployment, many means choice go called back.  Afaik pretty much one Nordics wearing masks sun sentinel reporting hospital capacity daily Travel ain't free bub. need take country Trump loses election... Yeah. guy missed point entirely. making political instead of, ahem, humane? fuck 'science communicator?' looked .. latest number shows Bexar 10,797 cases ... 5.61 per 1000 people.

5.61 per 1000 sound like much. remember two things. 

First, infected population grows exponentially (technically, cannot grow exponentially forever, part curve resemble exponential curve while), number get much bigger ... order magnitude bigger.

Secondly, typically procure hospital resources small percentage population expect large majority population going sick time. read TX roughly 15,000 hospital beds. already 6533 hospitalization. Given medical problems need hospitalized, far overwhelmed. heard Houston already 100% ICU capacity. Statistically *mostly* idiots affected. mean areas fired people warned reopen reopened anyway? undergrad minor law degree, never claimed lawyer hope insulting others makes happy, hope prosperous life living recluse ✨ Gyms reopening here, I'm seriously considering going. 

 
My gym's following state regulations maximum capacity 25%, everyone call beforehand see there's enough room, everyone needs bring sanitizers, equipment supposed sanitizer spray everyone clean work lockers showers closed off.

Is good idea? I'm honestly losing sanity now, almost four months now, working home exactly fun. Thoughts? can't even test everybody. ...and many th hem become *permanently disabled*?
Hmmm. Sit two seasons possibility turning pro, play 50 percent probability permanent lung damage? think worst offense testing. needed national program loans, grants, wartime laws forcing capable businesses produce enough tests could get weekly testing. point, shutdown would ever needed. 

Jeez, even leadership stupid realize immediately, follow proven playbook countries started ahead us. Use test world giving away free January!

No, instead fired pandemic response team yelled Leeroy Jenkins! simply testing young people since testing become easier?

It would interesting see breakdown age everyone tested time. Spoken like true ""independant"" [sic] thinker imagine typing large amount nonsense expecting people read beaches open san diego weekend yay nice know tried true method scaring anti-maskers staying inside. wish could encounter one crazy random situations results someone getting money rained go fund me. Right. shit, different year. Ok, maybe spoiled California. hell publishing before? really foresee chaos? extra layer irony anti-mask types pro-Trump. figure head government trust. Texas 14% positive rate...  (Drops mic) 30,000 New York. Basically entire population Juneau, AK. Couple months, just, poof.

aN uMbReLlA!!!! fired. said February Americans reason worry virus later repeatedly told Americans wear masks. response pandemic disaster top bottom. Kinda expected protests. I’m sure spread like crazy like across world let international students well.  I'm... pretty sure joke person replied disagreed original comment. Ok, turns can't reply without violating rule purely political posts (my reply got auto-deleted), I'll state I'm American contrarily assume 2nd paragraph, saying greatest thing ever I'm trying bring nuance (saying that's complete failure thing saying greatest thing ever) importantly I'm wishing great day. happen fall campus bars alone even counting dorm/frat parties.

[107 COVID-19 cases linked Harper's East Around 6 turns, assuming marathon speed CIV V. Karen it’s mile It’s public health crisis political crisis. words absolute gift anyone charge. parrot advice medical experts encouraging. “We’re going follow experts advice we’re gonna get together” Boom, you’re re-elected. Covid could’ve saved Trump’s presidency literally idea lead DJT? 

Look Facebook profile.  typical people, understandable wear mask pushing among followers. Look video rallies. political; common sense wear mask, he's opposite leading example. Baker great. Huge budget surplus last year well. going on. 14 days shows symptoms im 99% cases. extra costs damages isolating 26 days versus benefits catch 1% negative sum. Oh, well I’m asking studies. I’ve read 1 helped shorten hospital stays back. read nothing regarding lowering rate death anything else. links good scientific studies would interested seeing find one mandatory mask policy? Case study suggest bus closed circulating air safe spot - see third case study. keep window open allow fresh air come reasonably safe, outside air dilute viral droplets near also interrupt closed air circulation. mah rights, Co2 Yes that's dont believe handful officers able contain it.
And government mandated isolation stop fuckwits America protesting?
Sure, different countrys, shit, different smell.
And american police guns It’s official morons! 1918 repeating itself. “Most restrictive”? Maybe that’s Slovakia Remember Tedros said ""No human human transmission""? 

Just wait it!  important point remember wearing mask caring people come contact personal safety. wearing mask correctly tantamount saying 'fuck you' society. least they're still getting educated 2 hours day spent homework since schools shut Ireland

-- Sorry, piqued interest able read graph, taking test. 😟 previous day said coworker Russia, said ""oooh mention around him, he's Ukraine"" said ""yeah basically country"" tried correct replied something like ""yeah know big US is? countries look similar us"".

She outlier company 50+ people, sure, sentiment prevalent US. Notice hard say US may best without getting ""oh we're big country, everywhere"" (as things everywhere country), similar justification.

I also watched Jeff Daniels ""America best"" scene again, stood much ""convinced"" say it, much pregnant pause was. know TV, saying ""our country best"" anywhere else would laughable statement, whereas US controversial unpatriotic even admit opposite. WHAT?!?!?! (I know) someone American birth move European country multiple degrees, really easy. Drug abuse disorder medical condition. It’s genetic, neurological, psychological. It’s disease like cancer don’t know you’re talking keep mouth shut. follow news much, I'm guessing.. magical cure, well proven helpful. makes sad. realise many people pay tests. 
I get tested every 14 days (because I'm medical donor) free Australia.
They bring test door, 5 mins, give back, get messaged results next day.
They spit test now, available state.
Our country overbought tests (which 6-month shelf life) hoping could send USA, type this, realise cost mainly processing results nevermind... Potential!? I'm afraid inform particular ride lasts little longer. elaborate vascular problems? antibodies now, know it? test positive earlier? may believe community tens thousands people forced lock police officers people support policy.

People would lock homes, since government mandated act, businesses would cooperate.

Guns? know guns banned China? average police officer even need carry compulsion he's duty resolve civil dispute, needs get authorization carry firearm station. lol realize health care providers asking positive patients attended protest they’ve specifically ordered to? There’s way know didn’t contribute. Even area positive COVID protestor without mask cases exploded traced “tbd.” I’m Canadian travelled Austria last year. noticed told people I’m Canadian, they’d follow probing questions. Asking part Canada, prime minister was, far live Toronto. wondered testing see American pretending Canadian. 

Questions not, though, almost always started nicer found Canada. new york times charts awful. Convenient, report day report, day death/testing. That's seeing anything. Young people told covid kill them, like flu young, sniffles little cough back normal. old fear stay home young go lives save economy.

This message pounded brains still is. yeah wait college resumes fall. total shitshow! inland counties vote blue Florida? Exact experience here... live Ancient City St. Augustine, despite population old enough match nickname, routinely one mask level mask requirements finally enacted last weekend, weak are. times went get takeout restaurants jam packed brim old people prime targets thing, got looked like kind circus freak damn mask on. Everyone kind decided pandemic ended, they've acted accordingly. drive downtown area times week routinely see people gaming mask rule carrying bottle water / soda / whatever them, according law wear one circumstances. fucking pathetic, yet completely expected.

I grew Gainesville leaving go college here, went back visit folks couple weeks ago, like entering different world. everyone masks people actually practiced social distancing. refreshing know places state still take seriously, sparse may be. oh, well thats good point. true. Yeah, I'm really surprised cheap is. fully expecting way, way that. examples aspects, one positive two controversial, corporations entertainment. 

The first one MOOC. studied one best unis world, high pressure emulate American universities implementing MOOC system. years there, MOOCs biggest project uni.

The second one Black Lives Matter. killing George Floyd trigger large wave protests across Europe? Including heavy unrest France, leading official apologies Belgium colonial past. comes straight US say matter real people. 

Other examples include general wave neoliberalism free market capitalism European Union oriented towards end previous century current one. heavily influenced American economic theories rather wide support among European population given strength economic liberal parties around continent. entire economic model reshaped USA again, think Hollywood think matter real people. enough reality extreme left groups constantly criticise American imperialism. forgot /s. Masks kill people Covid-19. 36% likely catch Covid flu shot Lol ever wrote article gonna get crushed (rofl protest bars causing huge spikes younger people testing positive) mouth breathers actually rooting Trump get virus think would greater good save lives people saw get really sick/die. Its, good news. [bosch ? need 1 loose cannon walking around. 10k agree, due personal experience. work kitchen overnights none us wearing masks opened. kind assumed none coworkers would get it, taking right precautions outside work would fine. two people day shift caught reality smacked us hard face. serious talk negligent us put danger like that, felt terrible afraid. hard feel like something terrible happen you, will. will. likely heard podcast assumed gospel Checks people die, less people demand data. lmao wanna vent, need respond anything

My job frozen months. Workplace empty end sight. Everywhere around slowly becoming deader deader. running low money. Unemployment helps scrape long. dont want use savings choice, like lot people probably now. hate politics much, wish didnt exist anymore drowning crisis. going get bad lot peopke upcoming weeks. Wtf gonna do, man. afford scrape anymore?? agree, would like know story.

That said, headache, vomiting loss sense smell considered mild symptoms China. Typical clinical presentation China goes way ""pneumonia serious enough require supplementary oxygen"". good news is, vote fuckers out! Don’t vote, take 10 people vote. Reality well-known liberal bias. real problem shit there's vaccine they'll thing Facebook different Fox News™?

-An American who's going leave fast can. Read first vaccines. Read r0 read would’ve happened without vaccinations. 

Read actual peer-reviewed studies vaccinations. Stop taking health advice Facebook. sure city- (LA) state- (CA) wide good authority someone local gov tomorrow announcement restrictions tightening again. link describes free licensing. also available licensed sold developed nations, free (exactly US) Decent chance coworker sarcastic though, no? know lot people speak way effort mock country. feel like political stuff posted Reddit can't responded without muted. supposed political certain factions politicized virus, wearing masks, science, etc? civil discussion. true. heard dozens German politicians saying: „We become like USA.“ 

Be healthcare system, existing labor laws, political influence big companies, education system, bad food quality, homicide rates, school shootings, sensationalist media much more. often heard people: hope doesn’t get bad US. US fact often seen country wrong extreme Europe. American people sue shitty greedy leaders let people die greed? government Australia, think far lax prevention efforts. (Particularly since I'm Victoria experiencing current outbreak).

I've isolated home working home since March. fairness country music, lot country stars condemned shows. Access communities banned household items procured community workers.

But I'll say one last time, safety everyone community, public understands cooperates closure.

You know 10% people wandering around would waste 90% efforts people blocking homes. feel like info missing case 2....so suddenly better experiencing somewhat severe symptoms decided hang people days later? Crikey. wonder could've done prevent this. mean honest premier flat said covid worse flu anyone 65. get people care kind leadership. this. everything book stupid cunts ruin everyone. millennium

Also know European history could ever dream learning. EU =/= Europe. says link provided. Cuomo idiot. 

Haven’t done enough research give equally eloquent answer UK though.  stupid fucking comment chain ""humor"" really needs die reddit. people actually find shit funny? Like jesus fucking christ.  Dont forget. China. people habit dissapearing Masks muzzles make suffocate panic.

Funny he's wearing one. Maybe continuing shut it’s going spread outside dense areas rural areas state. ny example really nyc got hammered hadn’t shutdown could continued spread dramatically state infected killed many people longer period time. Succ bot 69 White house briefing. I’ve already resigned fact won’t get football year. least hope don’t. Now, really hard type live college football (Geaux Tigers) - - it’s worth life. Hell, it’s worth one case! 

I’ve watching lot golf. Yeah, always case. claim isolation world eyes everywhere Whats remedsvisimyr? Florida second largest population 65. 20% Florida residents 65.

If state risk massive death toll Florida. lot family Turkey told numbers people infected way higher reported, country trying hide ... I’m sure it’s true could believe really surprising cases surging? Testing also become much widely available. death toll least moment matching rate new cases. one point looking numbers CNN posted 6.4% people died it, 4.8% now. next week two could impact I'm sure, moment seem many losing lives absolutely right. crazy ignorant people even vaccine development. Maybe father doctor AIDS research, sure hell know even year develop vaccine wishful thinking. Vaccines often take decades develop. vaccine this. America grossly overestimates science's ability here.

What hit said worst case scenario. hell get here? question Americans need take long, hard look at. COVID-19 accelerated mounting problems, causing come head much quicker normally would have. mind boggling politicians able kick issues lane long. country moved issues thirty years ago effects issues began severely affect Americans 1990s. Thirty years pandemic took people get angry. trespassing act accordingly. matter improve treatments dont improve containment spread virus *to say spreading covid plain silly*

It's politically motivated drivel media politicians.

It's downright dangerous catastrophically undermines narrative pleads community-wide discipline empathy.

It undermines authority point people give fuck anymore advice recommendations.

""fuck it, pandemic over""

well done media Well depending goes population could change keep date calculation. sucks. many COVIDiots running around screaming ""PLANDEMIC LIBTARDS BILL GATES MUH PERSONAL RIGHTS"" country damn shape in. like love chasing red herring conspiracies ignore real ones front them. Instead intention harm could target fixation, want back normal, way life know. case counselor would better choice prosecutor. Nature nature does: improving odds survival species. Nobody stoop low POTUS areas cannot leave apartment complex unless cellphone barcode indicates health status clear, aka Code Green. contact positive person get Code Yellow must quarantine, fined $700 USD trying leave residential complex without good reason try enter store/bus quarantine done. Groceries delivery only. Code Red known positives I'm sure punishment try break quarantine, assume serious. Like gen Z? Florida 9,585 27th. Watch, today 11 we’re gonna break record. Andrew Gillum. win, idiots doe. need isolate let die out. Thi personally , would probably start fight someone would present argument face face response coronavirus shown ""people"" like majority. Salivating opportunity throw lives away make rich assholes richer thanking Supply-Side Jesus mere fraction value labor allowed keep. silver lining disaster people like tend act like everything fine. pandemic way decreasing someone's life expectancy. 21 deaths good news though. keep deaths low could good outcome. everyone needs catch point told country guarunteed paid maternity leave, sick pay, holiday pay, government health care children saluted flag every day school, I'd think talking North Korea something.  Lol. about? silenced first doctor spoke virus.
1 viral specialists also spoke media news viral outbreak disappeared.
So kinda crack smoking. I'll happy swing MIG weld door shut - DM address. 100% agree title. 

I fully believe reason due conspiracy leaders e.g. Alex Jones pushing conspiracies 

These conspiracy leaders narrative runs counter mainstream news government advice. That’s people watch them. mentality wanting know “real truth” what’s going behind scenes.

So pandemic early stages, yet fuel paranoia fire, claim terrible, covered everyone China dying world collapsing. also helps sell food supplies, miracle cures etc really driving fear uncertainty. Slow government responses due “only caring economy”, wanting “sacrifice population”.

When virus spreads slow moving governments catch begin lockdown endorse quarantine messaging shift counter mainstream messaging.

Now evil government “ asserting control” deliberately sabotaging economy exaggerating deaths. It’s honestly extremely predictable. What’s impressive however ability conspiracy leaders blatant U-turn completely flip messaging whilst also holding onto followers isn't, considered crime. fair enough. live Canada... watching amazement... well, scale...


Only problem is, like somebody told me, north America toilet bowl: US goes down, we'll sucked in... isn’t media talking this? swear see “timesofisrael” putting info this. 

I feel like 95% people don’t know potentially severe long term complications floor-to-ceiling mirrors audience careful aliens might probe I’m pretty sure racism disease? white people (perhaps unwitting) carriers?

It’s metaphor friend. See guys soon there’s new record highest daily count takes time infected people die Aight respond said. Well, kind laughed actually - that's response.

In months, I'll calling people idiots - ones prepared, refuse prepare, stand idly waiting someone take care them. Yup, TD's plan along, finally making México pay wall. say keep promises! mean always that. Cause think child repair broken marriage even though offspring half looks like person hate Even there's way reach November nothing, November cases could easily reach 10 million deaths could easily reach half million least November nothing done. Especially hospitals unable treat people mortality rises 10% seen Italy.

I feel like American politicians idea exactly close everything going shit are, 2.68 million cases confirmed already, that's 0.8% population. 129 thousand dead already 0.04% population. Without drastic action stuffs going really wrong really fast. good see places taking seriously. 

I'm Oklahoma right seen 5 people wearing masks, thousands people I've encountered work since started. 

It's become game try spot anyone wearing mask. China, government actually listens doctors scientists medical scientific matters. Many Chinese leaders, managers officials STEM graduates. used idea using actual expert advice. I’d rather welded protected constantly gaslighted told virus concern go back work serve corporate overlords lmao It’s cost, it’s America putting two fingers rest world saying lives Americans worth others world.

Lots people thinking America Fuck fed schtick. might true makes sense. mask probability get highest opposed random every day life. like kevlar vest siuted war zone trip supermarket. supply caught need use strategy. Also research caught up. Back know simple cloth masks effective, know are. Social distancing upper plains Midwest close zero long time. fine.

Regarding NY mostly myth. Hospitalizations usually considered lagging indicators infection 2-3 weeks depending source. Places like NYC NJ actually hit peak hospitalizations early April. believe New Jersey actually like last day March. 

So power hindsight virus actually past peak spread sometime mid-March already decling April. hospitalizations places like NYC NJ literally plummeting 2nd week April. Well yeah that’s thought how? People throwing statement around. government doesn’t control private businesses due factors merging.

Testing capabilities higher outbreak first hit, real amount infections time much much higher even though offical figures say higher now.

Deaths lag behind infections week two. new spike infections see sustained increase deaths likely end week next. due increased testing capabilities likely see spike deaths before.

Hospitals also getting better treating patients. Leasons effective treatments found trail error leading increased survival rate. Gilead provided cheap licenses 100 companies remdesivir production. company focused financial returns no. 1 priority. 

Which bought stock February. can't win. illegal US? Knowingly spreading disease classified danger public health? I'm sorry complete fool believe thousands gathered rioting protesting somehow capable spreading virus. many videos seen, tons people wearing masks, cases thousands people close together etc.

To say spreading covid plain silly.
For stats show sudden massive spike people color, one logical conclusion made based things going last several weeks.  next week. People seem forgotton huge trial showing: - ""Remdesivir use associated difference time clinical crack shot conservative culture. election year, plain &amp; simple. giant softball lobbed right plate. Trump saw coming, shoved bat ass lit hair fire. man truly moron people failed follow simple rules. United States change mind. One friends ER nurse covid team hospital. Yesterday posted PSA friends careful city, saw multiple cases day positives either knew positive already, least showing clear symptoms ill yet still hung friends, went bars, went shopping, etc til go hospital. People give crap :( Totally. I'm really bitter country's government welded door house shut yet. Nah, don’t put me. wet markets aren’t LITERALLY farmers markets. several “wild game” sellers several zoonotic virus stemmed from. don’t put anti-Chinese sediment me, that’s plight, headed. Go vegan. kind. saw that...I'm watching debate exact topic right now. 9 year old handle test absolutely reason anyone else refuse. First china doesnt let know many cases many died. control information gets out. Second, population isnt same. Third, city lot richer population previous flu experience. India didnt get hit flu people facing type situation first time life. 

Country never faced thing ever. alright country 0 experience policies handle type situation. worry, Remdesivir use associated difference time clinical improvement  pissed everyone... one group people blaming protests, another section blaming re-opening businesses.. ENOUGH politics.. let’s save lives... love god, kids’ sake, parents’ sake, loved ones’ sake..... respond I'm saying, make read nonsense. 

You're going calling Americans idiots months, want know Americans decimated system enriched you. Class mobility joke us choice children. call incompetence like, throw stone glass house pampered know reality fellow citizens. Regression mean. Infection rate likely considerably lower MA, unlikely zero new cases sustained. Well cant measure cant prove segregated.

If would segregated would see it. government bullshit yeah. came leave germany due visa expiring wanting stay. travel full time home return 100% want go USA. point, UK option europe (serbia opened soon after). fully prepared complete grilling immigration (i've issues UK immigration questioning past they've manually flagged passport get secondary questioning). e-gates, literally walked through. pretty shocked changed brits could use them. ironically tons brits get work mine took 2 seconds 0 human contact. made self quarantine became required, anyway. coming UK seeing germany things pretty surreal. i'm still adhering conservative rules people look like i'm freak mask. buy oculus lots lotion? Source re: burnout? Americans bitter China actually something citizens lol Right could easily walked hero make political. Almost could guaranteed reelection (well new Russian thing might killed that). ""*Most us reading extremest headlines generated clicks eat shit like 3/4 burger.*"" 


Such depressing (and even horrifying) visual, know true - long time. lot worse lately. DeSantis idiot follower larger idiot President! I’m proud country. Quite often disgusted government don’t take lightly country it’s people continuously criticized slandered. Problem 900 people one postcode refused tested entirely without complaint. definitely complaints initial lockdown!

But right vast majority complied. alternative? It’s fucked fucked dont scenario. good outcomes matter side you’re on. already thing spring semester; it’s repeat. Dunno, source that? don’t think virus going burning short period time. nyc took months get control strict lockdown. south it’s longer game due population density. South fucked especially bc refuse lockdown respect social distancing citizen United States grew hating kids around, hold breath. thing wake U.S. ton people dropping dead. Ideally, riots leading abolishment capitalism. Realistically, for-profit businesses exploit people's desperation convince take pay cut work dying breath enrich oligarchs.  segregation?

Black people sit back bus anymore, let's kid thinking America segregated society. Sure saves lot money much waste smearing facial bronzer? extra facial bronzer going drains also cause rapid decline coral reefs? need consider masks kill facial bronzer industry. happens u want lock properly first time round.. Yeah, heart failure communicable. think 1st amendment gives right kill bad lifestyle choices. However, taking recommended precautions protect others turns public safety concern mandated. point exactly. Get popcorn hunker down, take awhile. Tubing businesses comply shutdown. /r/CoronavirusAZ several people reporting gyms sending letters stating they're staying open. Hopefully business we'll right thing comply. Well, right want add much possible debt pile. Biden elected sneaking suspicion tea-party suddenly wake untenable debt situation yet again! really. time vaccine even reaches stage 3 know it’s safe. worst could happen something gets pushed doesn’t really help nothing get pushed negative side effects Actually, study came shows cloth masks quite effective limiting spread virus: said, worn properly fear may that. mean lost 8K people MA. call resounding success. lot family TX recall anyone pointing fingers saying much better time. could well boat months. hospital received full PPE load since pandemic.

All suppliers I've talked say thing. Global demand up. one extra.

We're mostly receiving pre pandemic order quantities. think numbers like terms cities. 126k entire city Green Bay. admit faults initial numbers then. revised numbers. revision revision. follow overblown estimates. People don’t believe revisions always go haven’t met outcomes know never admit faults. officials leave many gaps many contributions stories, reports, estimates handling this. get it, it’s “novel” could earn trust minds populous. Even it’s retroactive Texas hates intrusive government became intrusive government. data backs fact gathering outdoors low risk. surge cases linked protests. Thanks, too. 93% entire stock market held people net worth 1 million. dgaf. horrible leave thought many us particular case... even going bother saying. talking about? mean spike deaths 2-3 weeks? Please feel free share evidence that.

Edit — don’t frequently bet macabre topics deaths others I’ll gladly revisit topic weeks see lacks critical thinking skills.  Yeah, none cops wear masks, probably spread elsewhere. sod bot old people selfish entitled ruining everyone else's health.

It's old people I'm seeing go maskless. Someone correct I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure I've heard viral load affects severity. Someone possibly touching contaminated item touching face may bad someone inhaling aerosols nearby cough sneeze.  Arizona's already beaten us Covid-per-capita Yes absolutely. guy scared. :( Start /r/conspiracy move /r/conservative. I'm intentionally political thar second sub, trend toward ""it's bad lamestream media saying"" side things. idea bullshit tank economy alive, varying degrees. Full stop. Full stop. check out. huge fan songs tell stories. Seems bit dying art days least mainstream Yeah, entire lockdown reduced R0 number something like 0.6. Since virus generations last around week two, takes months die out. Basically long tail infections, lot like NY's new infection rates.

So Arizona Texas go back lockdown, it'll take months take get control. 

This soooooo fucked. part Arizona!! need 70% best estimate herd immunity. recent poll showed 26% Americans would get vaccine even free. means order get herd immunity would need vaccine 95% effective. flu vaccine around 67% effective every year. isn’t including people already infected ends bit lower target effectiveness is. let’s super generous say we’d need vaccine 80% effective 

Bottom line. vaccine likely get effective enough us hit herd immunity Thank much updating. . . horrifying. Last year lost money. goal break even. Rich People Feelings Chart can't go rich people force happy! Well, think would like month, vaccine gets approved (hopefully Oxford one September October), two aspects would encourage manufacturing thunder light speed. One is: countries world would want return full normal soon possible sake economies, invest lot manufacturing vaccines short time; Oxford vaccine invested unrealistically high amount money getting approved, imagine get approved. Two is: many medical company's would see life chance profit from. yeah, goes well, see would widely available November, like first first expected approved vaccine least March 2021, 12-18 month got beaten Moderna, maybe couple candidates (not Oxford since started 2 years ago), expect December. fair, ""do nothing"". ""lie numbers economy looks good November"". person purposely given dangerous, foolish information people 'in charge' contributed death, yes, due justice. mean you’re transparent AF arrest reports (why “Florida Man” meme) this. Maybe I'm accustomed suburban counties then. Tamarac Coral Springs might pretty suburban lived Pompano Beach. 

That's good point too, there's ton room sharing ridiculous prices We'll know 2 weeks July 4th. least traditionally holiday celebrated outdoors, transfer rates long people stay backyard Barbecue. It’s probably best something, sure it’s best public health though. like Az spike due protests, uptick cases would already happened NYC. time comes I'm sure come something snappy. friend mine experiencing short term memory loss ever since contracted disease back March. recovered month conversations people forgets later day. Texas border county coronavirus control. governor stepped in.” love honesty kids age. become teenagers. Enjoy stay safe. time place messing anyone, already big problem specific issue. Country gets elect President majority didnt want? Nice work America Boyfriend said yeah basically. Rehab forever dies. They'll walk day giant ventilator. guess takes like 4 people walk him. Fair - I’m sorry come across unnecessarily irritable. I’m facing destruction livelihood due this, it’s lot deal with. sanitize, wear masks, make customers wear masks, probably looking another shutdown.   mentioned haircuts original post. you’re talking people got didn’t wear masks agree point. protesters remove mask take drink water? go need use restroom? locations crowded indoor locations? What's effective way human generative large volumes airborne particulates responsible majority transmission virus? Shouting? vast majority people wear poorly fitted masks (if wear one all)? 

&amp;#x200B;

Even held outdoors, simply enough air movement reliably carry away airborne virus generated extremely dense crowd that's yelling chanting. Even people wore mask, majority wearing cloth mask (and likely one that's poorly fitted) that's almost completely useless filtering tiny particles virus. giving anti-maskers much credit determining outcome crisis. Stupidity cult. worship faith hate reason. worship ignorant hate educated. worship instinct hate expertise.

Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. study released picked moron chief used manipulate market public even study ends going where. climate settings irresponsible give opportunity. Hillsborough (Tampa) similar percent positive Miami closer 3k tests day average (I add numbers calculate I'm pretty tired kinda looked seemed fit) Miami Dade 8k-ish day.

They may find way less Tampa tests evolved far yet may idea exactly bad right now. Percent positive 14-18 percent recently one day since 6/22 14 percent positive.

I live one county Pinellas closer 10 percent last week. Things going really good like 20-50 cases day Tampa 70-100 days. broke 600 (Pinellas) 1100 Hillsborough. hear ya bro hope pans didn’t say overblown, I’m calling sheeple, either. believe ever seen chicken before. Ducey care lol... Yep. 


The crisis hit 36-year-old company emerged string acquisitions, helped diversify original acrobatic shows also put deeper debt.

It bought Blue Man Productions 2017, followed children’s entertainment company VStar Entertainment Group 2018. Last year, added Works Entertainment troupe magicians called Illusionists portfolio striking separate deal make feature-length films company co-produced hit “The Lego Movie.” corporations Widespread Panic fans might take offense. suppose there’s fair amount crossover Western NC. going sound crazy it’s real. significant caught virus job. works hospital. spent month quarantine I. twist even though present whole time room slept bed never caught virus don’t want vaccine survived shit naturally. think people still feel virus deadly personally selfishly care less now, measures would taken got point.

But wonder things need get dire drastic measures taken. course, there's time respond get there. I'm sure people saying exact things back March. Right now, current trend is. like driving towards cliff. Sure, driving towards cliff *now* necessarily mean driving *later*, long start turning away...

...

...

... turning? turn enough time? People really stupid must shit feeling bench-marked failure... you’re saying there’s ONE part pandemic response? say yes no. that’s look things understand narrative. look things general way understand people find polarizing.

I’ve shitting Swedish health care state administration is, state Swedish politics bunch things. don’t remember feel free look up.  didnt u hear Texas doesn’t want federal government tell do, prevents city county governments what’s what’s right them. (I.e. cautious pandemic precautions.)

It’s almost like federalism argument simply facade. Easy. market controlled artificially. guy thinks every single American job crisis hit. Elderly, children, disabled, homeless. actively employed workers. realize 4% unemployment, number totally meant misleading, right?

The fact 60% people aged 18 65 worked Covid, 40% dependent 60%. like 50% less working 50% dependent. That's huge. HALF working aged adults work country. worst employment crisis since Great Depression, bankruptcies even started yet.

I can't believe actually trying downplay job losses big deal, that's hilarious. sarcasm hard detect something? bet 4 months ago soooo proud many jobs Trump created, they've lost, like, ""who even cares employment numbers?!"" did. hairdressers infected infect clients. big story sub. mess around either. got saw family without masks (it parking lot though social distancing) yelled ""hey! Put mask!"" Bullshit. Nurses still take days off. Florida lot capacity states tourist destination, one going vacation right hospitals nearly capacity. know people like like go internet lie scare people Someone said wife I, we're like... whole world, billions people, part conspiracy take away freedom be... what... bit less comfortable? need cancel fourth! women can't control regarding host clubs squandering it. Depends are.. I've three restaurants MA.

All 3 tables spaced far apart, 2/3 felt safe everyone following mask discipline careful. last bar feel safe go back there. servers care masks two tables next us full drunk 20-somethings abandoned social distancing go flirt other.

in general though I'm trying support local businesses carefully safely. Someone make masks tweets them! much potential squandered. USA could brought peace prosperity entire world. Rather, selfish would rather rid country anyone skin color them. Phooey! happen them. ask them. teeth break skin, worry saliva.

Source: I've seen zombie movies. comparing risk cruise ships protests highlighting specious reasoning pointing cities outbreaks protests. exactly reasoning smoking lobby scientists used negate effect smoking many years. fact remains everywhere significant outbreaks right protests exactly would expect contributory action occured. seriously still elective surgery's they? Willfully ignorant lives matter It’s never individual prove otherwise, SCOTUS quite consistent issue past 250 years. Look, understand agree could enforced would help slow interstate spread. 

It’s enforceable.   think that's still giving much credit. told hate masks leaders hate masks. leaders dont like masks feel people taking seriously goes message everything fine, average joe theyre theyre told. imagine restrictions lifted significant portion elderly population go right back vacationing Florida beaches die.

Or backyard barbecues grandparents neighbors...

And school opens fall professors/lunch ladies probably infected (and die) exposed tens thousands people every day.

More cases means overrun hospitals Play covid games, win covid prizes enough people country socked face lifetimes. legit never seen 3 people inside GNC everytime I've walked one looked window thumbnail Desantis captures accurate depiction he’s responding r/eyebleach help Don’t half people already false sense right now? people never get vaccine people opposite views do? results would worst symptoms unvaccinated non-believers 50% protection get vaccine. 😆😆😆 major cities stopped last Thursday. That's works, man. made bold claim (this guy said thing months), asked proof, doubts it. burden proof claim you.

I see data back claim. Unless any, taking L one.  Everyone focused vaccine, still going need effective treatments thing. read lot anything repurposed drugs treatments. Heres hoping team continues see success. havent looked fully, likely true. biggest points contention number tests conducted seems absurdly high, doctors/nurses spoken issues ""fell windows"" obviously bad history public transparency general. seem weird would admit many cases, could also tie back testing issue; many tests conducted may guesses presumed cases people werent actually tested all.  presented ER January dyspnea, sob, mild unproductive cough, throat pain trouble swallowing. remember kept spit tons fluid weeks. gross embarrassing. also nauseous, episodes overheating rip clothes night. Overall uncomfortable. 30 January 1am. believe announcement Global Concern made following day? 

Immediate breathing treatment, inhaler issued Nebulizer. Presumably adult onset asthma. 

Was hospitalized last week “evidence chronic stroke” MRI ruled out. new lesions brain possibly due migraines 🤷🏻‍♀️

Lymphadenopathy left side. Left side ear pain head pain, left side chest pain. Feels like I’m zapped. 

Imaging came back revealing pulmonary cyst lower left lobe. 😳

Labs came back high C-reactivate protein Sed Rates. 

Covid swab negative think new findings contracting virus January. ER doctor said fighting something awhile wasn’t manifesting normal infection. 

I originally thought ear infection fluid behind ears lost hearing Tuesday followed Syncope episode. new findings family history risk factors things. 

So consensus likely January fighting since. new findings appeared January June year. 

In January idea ask country. not. 

Now I’m 35 possible lung disease, never smoked. team new doctors whole lot confusion fear. suffer rare brain disease none would cause this.

Edit: also fun new thing wake bruises feet sometimes turn purple. Agree major corps. company laid off, I'd know decide feel. option go business, lay 92 people, get PPP loan save 500 jobs, I'm kind fine it. important consideration number increasing. GS doesn’t want another fc crisis.... it’s expensive fc.

Maybe force national mask policy end mere fact cannot buy n95 mask, six months initial outbreak, shows poorly supply lines broken. converting factories way retooled WW2.

aaaaarrrggjhfhfh hate this. think everyone else going parties don’t like them? I’m old reddit standards. miss people much, miss nightclubs. ever nightclub? They’re awful. want put $5 jar Howl Moon yell talk friends ear drink fishbowls throw street. 

If want boil real vapid terms: lost SPRING. we’re gonna lose summer couldn’t skip parties TWO WEEKS. Oh, also HUNDREDS THOUSAND lives lost. That’s... take everyone you’ve ever spoken age, multiply around... dunno. 500. That’s many people getting removed world, they’re tip network deaths... whatever. Party on, dude. Go ironically drink Corona lite. I'm process trying go there. I'm praying, crossing T's dotting I's pity let even days minus quarantine, course. Since Pennsylvania part Midwest? I'm fully recovered!

I ended fairly minor symptoms, fever (102 highest) days, cough couple weeks. far worst part anxiety, found meditation helped took lot vitamins could tell everything could.

Keep remembering outlook good since young healthy, try let stress get you. Good luck, get well soon! thought seasonal flu vaccine generally 30% effective? Data 2019-2020 flu-season:

*""Based data 4112 children adults, \[2019-2020\] vaccine effectiveness estimated 37% influenza 50% influenza B viruses. Influenza B the* [*predominant *in December, mid-February sharp rise in* [*influenza That’s don’t want it. soon hands becomes subject sunshine laws. Better put head sand.

I'd also wonder people get vaccine won't, think prefer double blind scenario get much data survive horrible know are. Duct tape? Try scotch tape. They’ll need masks avoid becoming like us. feel like could worked type rent/mortgage freeze moratorium top down. Put payments pause maybe federally guaranteed amount time. 

It's tough situation around feel like trillions dollars used stimulus package could made go much this. amended excluded major corps. People always trying find loophole. heard business laid 92 people 500 employee limit required qualify. listening. Worldmeter distributes deaths based historical data. Meaning place deaths day happened (based info provided NJ) keep data consistent. big spike. Phase 4: numbers ? correct thinking 50% effective also likely means reduces severity 50% still get covid? really odds high- 90% better- would help lessen severe course disease?

This doctor always explained flu shot me. helps certain percentage get flu. Others get flu likely less severe vaccine.

I certainly hope covid vaccine same. lol must really trying provoke noncompliance telling people change preferred appearance?? That's helpful reason there's much resistance now. correct. skeptical co-workers ask me: 'do know anyone infected?' say no, builds perception overblown experts. I'm clear arguing affordable care act bad thing? want understand saying health insurance better currently place despite shortcomings? saying, right phunkysox, confused? Keep drinking Kool Aide world 125K rising deaths acceptable, 3-7 lives negligible ten-thousandth that. Unless players refuse play, distinct reality. Many players would also torn possibly losing ""chances"" make big. Yep, won’t last. Eventually something give it’s going crash again. He’s genuinely never good businessman.

I pretty mild case back feb week &amp; took months recovering quoted bit went away. Sometimes I'm still really sure went away reduced again. worst part coffee tasted like sadness &amp; despair months Tell follow rules. It’s absurd went ignore quarantine. care 31,176 deaths New York State? People act like reason mess. NY doc here. happened normal. forget k-pop thats probably best way proof went parties Fuck rest us shorter line too. numbers fine, nothing worry /s able share seeing pediatric floors? helpful right now!

That said, lucky bad her. definitely flu. politifact first two Google results, that's all. looking quick sources - Reddit thread, graduate thesis record agree you. simply pointing mindset others. deserves ""Good News"" given. 

IMO, need extend/expand this, small businesses (not major corps), need expand rent/mortgage programs well pandemic unemployment assistance. 

Yes economy screwed right now, protect vulnerable segments population going get much worse. original report Goldman Sachs here: 

Goldman Sachs cites following study inspiration country-comparison effectiveness masks:  Sure, ""done."" vaccine, biomedical scientist, call done deal. many things could go wrong, concerning study reaching statistical significance due little spread. often vaccines take long develop. treatments, know worked quickly. vaccines, wait around someone get infected. really baffles anyone buys anything number mindless cogs saying ""yay let's get back work,"" still surprises 4 months shit. Just... surprising... Lmao defunding police department nothing enforcing laws. Defunding literally lowering funding department. U know... like they've defunded education department many times yet still government funded public schools... (Which think mayyyyyybe take bit police department put education department). Also, u enforce rules local level employees managers denying ppl entry places without mask. college parties jam packed floorboard warped in. Colleges reopen. Thanks. hope god best there. We're also celebrate major social/party holiday weekend please wish us luck. admitted lying? Link source? whose travelers advised quarantine upon arrival include Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas Utah. I'm pretty sure schools going say ""no vaccine, coming"" airlines going say ""no vaccine, flying."" convince lot people Bullshit.

Canada resumed normal operations almost business now; numbers still looking great. people wear masks, everyone good social distancing. Putting country lockdown isn’t necessary seems - America’s mentality also clearly doesn’t work. President spent months denying virus problem, putting family members charge critical aspects response, even Pillow guy speak big gathering CEOs supposed pitching produce equipment respond -- White House thrown pandemic playbook developed SARS epidemic. Yes, Oval Office mattered. franchised yea good thing humanity. correction evil thing humanity. that's copyrighting attempting hoard means produce medicine. show dead bodies, maybe get head ass Yeah close one another places... dunno.. seem like obvious non-essential businesses may well shutter limit things even slight. That’s dilemma. side things small business like gyms, housekeeping, nail salons, etc best won’t able make money. mean staying safe first priority suck able get businesses going. mean know it’s unpopular honestly, county/state well small case counts you’re careful not? much longer everyone gunna quarantine life. I’m slowly working public. friends young healthy see other. Keeps fucking sane honestly. quit Facebook month ago made decision make conscious effort keep lives care about. So, asking send pictures kids, calling catch up, etc. need connection. less mindless scrolling. tomorrow may look like guy beat high school, he's got this.  That's people anti lockdown. Unemployment money run eventually does, things get extremely ugly. Actually obama record needs destroy healthcare give us single payer.  obama destroyed healthcare longer office.  Congrats mission half accomplished... Exactly.

And next week best take vaccine chip, way end this.

Otherwise... knew masks worked. didn’t want general public buying all. keep worshipping “science” like it’s religion. Don’t Like Us  comparing rights go shoe-less shirtless? Businesses allowed dress codes. Interesting. know windshield blocks UVA/UVB. wonder it’s standard case glass panels/windows cars? Cost?  Ha! over-ear headphones right now, much day except work we're supposed to. listening *James Brown*!

I call em stupid guy listens Rush Limpballs morning.  aint practicing dance moves!

Twenty people got arrested Hawaii PR? Go preach uneducated bullshit somewhere else. Hell drink bleach told course Throwing blood? economy?? Absolutely (un)believable.  You’re playing Fire, son/daughter/other Lying what? Lol, turns cannot rectify trolling. Try keep track lies wont happen plague rat.

I absolutely defending CCP anyway. feel anyone choosing buy luxuries china better slave owner. need made pay world virus, crimes humanity form genocide.

But saying virus big deal. seems like one defending china dude. know, since keep saying virus big deal... Tea tastes normal smell ventually came back. Lemon lift good Wow know pretty much sums great state Arizona right like high forties education snow birds fucking suck. Cases keep rising... testing more? cases always way higher know we've able test enough? get data county's rising hospitalizations deaths per 100k flatlined ZERO 1-2 months. What's going on? fear rising cases bullshit fear mongering. number infected always far higher test for... Test more, we'll find more. wrong? believe he's part Donald's squad would threaten convention, would unacceptable made whole big show moving NC similar reasons. Happy Cake Day! thats im saying all.  even close.... Im saying documented proof cases way cheaper pay covid test pocket high deductable plan became even popular obamacare became law.  Paying 6k insurance kicks pointleas anyone healthy.... test result- received yet? fired enforcing policy enforcing unprofessional manner? read links. Again, none links say virus remains body indefinitely. still know got information from. response getting Facebook. general online privacy law US, someone getting data building profile go online. wasn’t, boomers approx 73m US population around 55-75 gen x approx population 65m around 39-54 right now. use internet, maybe gen x boomers sure, know plenty people 60s regular Facebook Twitter users. results different per user, generally show think likely click on. Perhaps think unlikely click real sources.

You check Michigan link gave you. claiming 6.2k deaths, 7,700 deaths last year lower accidental traffic deaths.

It's also pneumonia blamed deaths. Covid-19 causes myriad heart lung issues many could lead complex health problem. Good. worthless trump followers terrorizing employees city too... preaching turning america muslim wearing protective masks. Maybe country stupid deserve wiped Oh, fluey, Ron still bad timing summer trips. China whitelist travelers EU soon. still mandatory quarantine 14 days make sure travel happens absolutely necessary. Better maga idiot maga mask maga idiot mask. Excellent choice Omergerdddd chee meh profileeeeeee *surprised pikachu* Different time zones reporting think. hold reputable source. original included healthcare related businesses exclusions providers (basically followed FMLA shorten time employed guideline) changed expanded healthcare involved business employees. 

I believe concern much PTO would provided considering increased risk, def high cost state (employers would get payroll tax credits paid sick leave due COVID even many chose 
not provide regardless) staffing issues would arise. 

There large healthcare institutions provide 2 weeks didn’t require employees use PTO banks CDC guidelines institutions changed tune, shortened required time work. 

All horrible indeed. Staff disposable. think you’re right, American’s wear sunglasses lot—but fair, sunlight America brutal lot places. live, actually get headaches don’t wear outside 20-30 minutes.

But Americans almost always take sunglasses inside engaging cursory conversations.

So I’m sure really disproves point? Anybody ask Fauci many could saved would lied masks march?  quick correction article specifies “quilting” “quilter” cotton, “quilted” cotton. former describes grade quality fabric, latter construction technique multiple layers fabric stitched together decorative patterns stitching.

Be may, “quilter” “quilting” cotton, cheap readily available, pretty loose weave denser weave like “shirting” (i.e. smoother tighter fabric good man’s shirt) shown another study effective.

Am overracting go stay family even seeing 3 strangers? I’m glad I’m one. I’m firm believer vaccines anyone doesn’t moron. limited knowledge subject(so please correct me!) quickest vaccine ever made something like 10 years pulling one projections less year. Seems kinda scary me. Canada functioning political system, health care system, social support system. Americans pressured re-opening partly broke, savings health care lose jobs, government lead disinformation campaign political ends. 

I'm making point saying Americans stupid entitled whatever tell whole story last thing need animosity toward one another. Also anger coronavirus response add nice spice chaos stew! likely flare need beatten back times. right. EU Asia it. us unwilling use stronger measures needed ensure outbreaks rare spaced vaccine ready. Permanent shut location seems apt... mention guy total idiot go public it... variety opinions black community. know it’s hard try stress get results. There’s nothing moment except continue act safely. Stress impacts immune system try relax can. Good luck. currently lawsuit Hawaii, ruling handed weeks. wait see happens paranoid, mean wrong ::) know, broken watch saying!!! Masks mitigate chance spreading covid-19 others. talking young woman article, says wearing mask. this? state something different later? saying could get PPE mask medical workers general public buy everything out. administration never resupplied it. think administration going let tell truth? 6th president worked knows Trump insane. playing long game. would said anything earlier ass would door. set stop losses shit actually gets announced jumps lose preserve profit. shit. ""We're open, know need protect, folks younger demographics, although want mindful what's going on, simply much much less risk folks older age groups.""

So he's back saying young peopke really risk. 

There's much blood man's hands. girlfriend this! Yes. doctors positive covid back January. Couple days ER getting hounded travelled anywhere. chest inflamed almost month. Coldstone change policy then! fired employee enforcing corporate policy protects CORPORATION coddle trump cult want virus wipe country out. Coldstone worthless admit accident front authorities enough time make necessary edits omissions Florida healthcare workers feel really bad guys right now. would require form competent leadership. HAHAHAHAHA!!!!! 


We're gonna die :-/ Yikes sorry :( disagree you?  point recently I've seen whole coronavirus thing become another example polarized toxic fight devolved masks versus masks childish fight much that. Education, fear, less of. three states either close record number cases. experienced exponential growth recent weeks. None states effective contact tracing program. may direct evidence showing protests contributed figures, according [CDC guidance concerning large protests either higher risk highest risk risk**: Virtual-only activities, events, gatherings.  risk**: Smaller outdoor in-person gatherings individuals different households remain spaced least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, share objects, come local area (e.g., community, town, city, county).  risk:** Medium-sized in-person gatherings adapted allow individuals remain spaced least 6 feet apart attendees coming outside local area.  risk**: Large in-person gatherings difficult individuals remain spaced least 6 feet apart attendees travel outside local area. one will
need much TX FL combined! No, epidemiological science talk masks started proven significant effect growth rate virus. likely literally ""grave"" understanding. Sadly realized lot people selfish. see posts “friends” saying gym important lives. need mental health whoever vulnerable virus stay home. Arizona horrible state opinion. many awful selfish people lol I'm Ontario daily numbers 200. recovered trending higher infected... US numbers like million dollars... comprehensible number.

I hope country heals man... covid socially. makes okay mock people died? Opening schools control country prove big mistake Pure bleach.. way sure. I’ve lived Los Angeles life visited North Carolina first time years back. didn’t know real meaning “bless heart” thought everyone cordial look antiviral supplements like pou d'arco, neem chaga mushrooms. stop looking single point data - people definitely died today reported tomorrow balanced amongst days correct data. cases still staying low death rates follow gets LTC facilities FL matches 9.5k day could see USA breaking 50k Thurs Fri theory :-/ ""I'll take chances""

I know people. Could? *ARE GOING TO?* many fucking idiots there. it’s fault happen. it’s lack federal leadership whatsoever blame that. That's fair would say examples gave also examples indoor gatherings. example, think baseball team likely spread virus, playing game locker room.

All socializing type situations *could* done safely. Sadly, belief public would able safely practice. small number people care.

You locked homes put unemployment. Businesses went recover. Families past rent pay can't.

That amount life affect looks like nothing. OK Double flu. think forced home basically nothing fucking pissed.

Took away lives harsh flu.

Remember, media played 3-5% mortality rate beginning. see thus think government big business lied.

Just saying. number small people care. 300k number. since small people truly pissed.

It's election time President made political. Pissed people politics means fuck small number deaths. They'd die anyways, probably old.

Welcome America. Next time kill people.

I'm going back chilling home, try die all. =) CTs pathological contrarians? Support Lowe's instead Home depot. Home depot huge Trump donator way think lot people going north, 5 billion human beings need infected herd immunity occur. Let's hope happen though possible I've trying support to-go gift cards, hear --- there's easy answers this, us try guess best choices believe Europe mask dystopia too? Mask use rare, many countries nobody wears masks all. fair *does* say “ability” respond pandemic. capable responding don’t seem interest to. Well I'm trained expert immunology developing therapy COVID-19 I'm sorry say u/Rotishery completely correct.

We dexamethasone. sort remdesivir (but hard administer many doses it). (novel) antivirals take years develop. drug repurposing pan far, expected since viruses require specific treatments rarely cross-activity them.

I'm hopeful JAK inhibitors, BTK inhibitors, maybe repurposed drugs, take considerable time work all.

The safest assumption we'll find optimized treatment protocols better strategies supportive care patients. However, I'm even close hopeful we'll anything close ART Harvoni HIV HCV respectively end year even end 2022. Oh yeah live TN know way many people Florida past month. prior coronavirus vaccine attempts Meh. drug proven shorten recovery time. proven reduce probability death. Sure would prefer ill 2 days less. must drug, sure get patients overcrowded hospital quicker survive, freeing capacity... better plan fill hospitals first place. Giant dude, T-shirt says “mask, fuck off”. Problem solved. agree you; I’m also fed media contributing all. past headline long ago: frustrating. One week stay home, next aren’t. flip flopping media driving insane!  Compared what? almost 3000 new cases yesterday. That's people get whole ""Billionaires profited"" sold markets plunged. Especially since average people 50K likely sell stocks get past couple months. 

Who think bought market back up?? 

I sold February. Started keeping ""cash"" building money savings bought back made 40% return far. imagine much Millionaires Billionaires much knowledge made rebound. Mask wearing almost definitely universal saw. mention wearing cloth mask going trap 100% airborne particles droplets generated activities commonly performed protest. Combine extremely dense crowds engaged activities and... see anyone convince protests (which support) significant contribution surge cases. know thing??! 🤦‍♀️ thank you! helpful!! think Trump unfit Presidency hundreds reasons, unhealthy one them

I'm simply judging Trump criteria fitness uses competitors. mocked Hillary's age perceived frailty hundreds occasions. What's good Goose good Gander. means quick. Ventilators causing many people die would’ve made put pressure. Huge bungle early obviously didn’t pursue further. 

Plus there’s steroids help critically ill now. forgot ""smug"" ""clenched."" Fears?! Don’t abide rules protect others deserve get. Hi neighbor!! 🙋‍♀️

And you’re right, says everything.... COVID-20, also CHINA Actually lol'd. Thanks. wild watching happen. 

Before came US: government lying, China lying, airborne aids, better build bunker, bioweapan, etc etc


And hit US. suddenly: election hoax. 

Same people. 

Like. What??? seem understand works. Let try again. Yes state got power order self quarantined, refuse must go judge get judge signed ordered. need provide evidence court likely danger people. state high number infected mean infected. Also would person. Judge going issue blanket order Everything virtue signaling. virtue signaling right too. one communicate all. exist? No. better treatments now. Wake fuck up. say completely truthful said need masks beginning Hyper-normalization scary tactic. Jesus. hell parents thinking??? someone comment 'they missing zeros' 😂 seriously needs 'good news' flair live USA **honestly** telling USA respect Coronavirus. interesting! Thanks! might awesome. Since staying home wearing (real) mask public, I’ve gotten sick zero times almost 4 months. Normally would multiple illnesses span. wife two kids normally sick AF daycare. Pretty gross. Add Pennsylvania list states inadvetently decided try remote learning again...  Roll tide? Yes, masks perfect need handled correctly useful necessary people going able shelter place. everyone can, certainly indefinitely. Many people work others need buy necessities masks needed people need educated use correctly.  help limit exposure. Asian countries figured out. too. Nope. Wednesday Thursday Friday didn’t happen last week. say mask issue supply. Fauci downplayed masks make sure health care workers could medical grade masks... changed recommendations 2 months in. politicized bull shit came in. remember telling mother January start stock piling masks nursing home works China making unobtainable purchases. didn’t realize going happen.   hold PhD field.

If Moderna similar ""RNA"" vaccine, I'm waiting bit. first human scale so.

If old tried true methods? I'll take two thanks. rain makes corn corn makes whisky even possible? Social gathering? uptick? don’t believe it! coming pharmaceutical company studying drug. I'll wait studied independently. kind dick. lot easier use social distancing wearing masks (and effective possible do).

Using right firm protection right situation always worked Public money private religious schools think happened. would take 80 straight days 40k cases day get 2.7 million cases mid September Texas.

When current spike became clear, ballpark 5k something cases day, governor shut bars limited restaurants 50% capacity. continues go expect actions taken.

If got anywhere close 20k cases day see state fully shut down.

There's logical way gets 10% state September, that's ridiculous fear mongering. Well, potentially profitable ... gave reason ""opening indoors"". saying plenty also happen outdoors spread virus (sports teams, gatherings, kids meeting friends, etc.). wanted point - indoor outdoor socializing. Well, half Americans job anymore quite right since numbers include retired people kids (and people who've stopped looking work).

That said, think far off. comes back vengeance fall (since summer supposed slow rate transmission) we're going see big jumps kick economy balls. I'd say 90% Americans clue economy actually is, prop stock market everyone happy. Yeah, EU article meant Schengen Area. Ireland exception could think burner registered vpn. stretch mask far can, dump whole plate chew like horse using feedbag finished meal. 

You take mask eating, man. Well damn... wonder folks burning buildings spread virus mad think US world leaders advertising communication come together produce public health messaging everyone could get behind.

It's it, people government actively refused it, encouraged others state level also refuse it. became partisan message lost. 

It really help Fauci downplayed lied masks beginning heavily erroded credibility lot people, put wrong message early people run with. thing. whole thing shitshow since Feb, we've got lot go. I'm sick it. slide hotdog end. Two birds one stone type situation manufacturers? Ppl money actually care? Honestly, thought enough PPE. thought taken care months ago. took longer care admit didn’t understand tag “title” meant changed could never see text screen change. never dawned title webpage browser. 

So yeah, “development!” pretty bad mistake let go without negative test, completely fair, ""allowed roam freely"". instructed drive non-stop isolation hotel Auckland destination Wellington without coming contact anyone. 

The issue, apart test thing, supervised turns come contact someone (who since tested negative) although technically possible drive distance one tank, lot people wondered could trusted since lied things. 

Personally, think big flop whomever charge organizing quarantine releases, lot Kiwis miss funerals births lockdown felt sort unfair, shone light issues quickly addressed think helped remind people seriousness situation overseas, good many people get complacent want reopen borders fast. Yea agree kinda need phone Funny said Boston knew exactly meant(implied). person lives stereotypical thinking obviously.  RIP 😢

Why can't common goals:

1. Wear mask

2. Social distancing

3. Procure PPE essential / health care workers

4. Forget politics. common enemy Coronavirus, other, regardless races political parties.

We destroying other. almost like advanced warning That's good hear! Citation needed “the spike started 2 weeks ago.” can’t say protests caused spike 2 weeks ago started 2 weeks that. You’re *assuming* protests caused spike, begging question. Numbers, please. Pretty much yep, there's certain level completely stupid stands pretty clear. I'd put person people suggest bleach enemas cure anything. positive test rate us insane. Something like 5% Italy 0.5 Mass tested 17,600 people attended protests positivity rate 2.5%. states rolling average around 2% week little affect I'm getting called back work furlough DFW tbh I'm terrified Trump breaking blue test vials setting cure research back too. hyDrOxyCHolRine ThOugh? taxes. US still terrible test rate. read 10-k, spend 9.1bn RnD (40% revs).
But think really point. RnD spent based patented areas incentivize discovery new molecules. Hcq instance, ancient molecule, such, limited profitability prospects. public healthcare corporation reason finance controlled studies medicine. Worse, able spend 9bn rnd, probably able influence local policies towards medicine, even neither cheapest efficient (cf Lancet total joke study).
Death rates amongst country worst worldwide (below countries like india morocco), big question mark engineer drugs. whole property right concept apply healthcare all? look outcome, maybe not. Whichever one happens faster cool me. visit family weekend? Even south Korea, spread linked super spreader events like religious gathering sk, club spreader sk, etc Reading news like europe mindblowing, really something hard believe, like alternative universe. Israel locked already go down. showing here? 40 times cases 1.2 times death. Even go back month still looks like virus 10-20 times less lethal used be. 

Dude we’re testing more. Deaths aren’t exponential skyrocketing. over. Get it. death rate low. Pretty brave trump cabinet member say increased infection rates due increased testing without immediate action virus get control. Azar walked Trump line around reopening country trying reach citizens directly tell wear mask. hosed unless get Trump there. Dude needs golf course 24/7 team get s*** done. Quite interesting. curiosity, city responded pandemic? guess it’s promptly President Trump responded, right? never wildest dreams imagined would bookmarking site buy dozens pounds rice beans later. say that, Disney stock dropping all, staying steady even slightly increasing right admist crazy increase Florida cases. getting downvoted speak unpleasant truth people like hear. Well hope holding vaccine. really UK here, can't order online? Save stress totally barricade beginning. Society much different back worked. 


Our society today can’t work old ass fundamentals. see, big orange slug hell bent keeping statues racist forefathers instead shaping type future. whole entire system. 

America failing like comments post. true fall failure eminent. Scary stuff unfolding America right now. could've pulled Bush 9/11, unite nation run accomplishments tackling covid successfully protect American lives. 

But fake success jump criticizing governors antiscience attitude. another gov't agency proving worthless, biggie. s/ ""People call world tell me, know, absolute best data. can't believe great data is. never seen data like before."" still kids College?? point 14 states logarithmic doubling cases.  beginning 4 citys condition caused near total lockdown.  14 states? Yeah horse barn. Window boarded cemented over. 

Under lockdown everyone said better make worth it.  pissed away. There's post going around ingredients vaccine. quick Google search first ingredients followed ""in food""...they appeared food. think people understand ""toxic chemicals"" safe small quantities (formaldehyde, mercury, etc).

Another post saw ago talking fentanyl epidurals. People FREAKING it...fentanyl pain killer, makes sense, hospitals use small quantities. meant physically violence head head, want, would complete self fulfilling prophecy. need smarter that. bit hard believe protests riots apparently okay. Unfortunately July lockdown still place :( looks like study might come true need tease, we're breaking record damn near daily :( majority, couple days ago, nearly 40% Americans polled approve administration's handling virus. speaks volumes. San Francisco here. live west side city near Golden Gate park. strange majority people neighborhood seem wearing masks. Yet walk park huge groups people mask. People seem problem wearing mask (correctly) stores. guess I'm lucky live do. unrealistic expect people cut contact families friends possibly lose jobs 3 months straight

Spoken like true American. Come on, think got level now?? People seeing friends family going work. Sounds white. really baffles you? We’ve got people protesting threatening government leaders mandating masked cause they’re “woke” know it’s hoax control 5G towers real enemy. 

People fucking idiots, many business make money banked principle Yes know. Here's counter CT.

The conspiracy they're playing reverse psychology. would best way people remain unmasked mass surveillance program? Tell *need* wear it, turn people would naturally defy. Chess mate. Always remember Corona avoids protests concerts. wish could that, really sucks knowing family could get lower priority people who've wrong things whole time. Meanwhile we've stayed home since 2 weeks even stay home order (which let's honest kind joke, many things ""essential"" including salons). 
I 3 young kids, thought medical emergency help available... honestly terrifies me. AZ really bad place right now, still lot people refuse give shit. us American realize joke decades Masks good countries eerily similarities: either dictators (like Bolsonaro Putin, perhaps Modi?) coddle dictators, like Trump. remember. gov caved COVID. :( US REOPEN failure boils one simple concept Americans can't grasp. 

The government care get covid long gets reelected. Remember, first pandemic ever countries tried shut society completely try cope disease. South Korea New Zealand really putting eggs one basket hoping early release vaccine. That’s quite bold. mortality go up? 10,000 day OK? 20,000, 40,000? 100,000 need worry? Good know.

Meanwhile, China freaks 5. It’s worse 6 months watching go country country state state. HipHop?  situation actually better cut back testing? love think countries world crazy, unprecedented events lifetimes believe causing lot long suppressed feelings come surface. view something positive come all. Bring open take look true feelings maybe start work reaching least kind understanding other, even though may never agree.

I worked closely right wing people long time already knew feelings BLM, etc surprised me. Funny since besides actually pretty good folk respect many things them. think ever *thought* deeply certain things, like people actually dying rights disrespected would think would really hearts want that. Maybe I'm wrong. Can't figure out. outnumber much times though wonder I'm one who's brainwashed! thought goes away half second.

However liberal friends neighbors surprised little bit. want go protests me. That's cool. see people responsibilities family care want jeopardize that. wrote told attending went sent videos took silent. It’s “for profit” sense nobody owns shares Cornell operates 501c3. Plus state NY owns controls significant part it. bottom line meet financial obligations. 

If anything open, would institutions catering young healthy segment population. last 50 years world seen such. Cars still killing people. repairing roads? Took manikin version CA CA dental board approved it. Went well, much less stress finding perfect patient hoping show up. Hope Texas board moves allow wife take too. Thank sharing article. found informative, answered lot questions thought USA! USA! USA! I'm 20s healthy germophobe anyway thought making partner anyone else lives apartment complex sick drives insane. yet I've seen 3 people complex wear mask. makes feel personally hurt angry defeated... like, nobody care anyone else? nobody care me? supposed together.... I've mentally exhausted quarantining months end nothing. I'm tired. late that, going since Reagan really. Charlie Darwin Band. / phase dead ? weren’t US keeping little brother Canada safe country would taken stronger, powerful nation

You mean US got fucking handled *Vietnam*? need keep possibility re-election unlikely. Thank you! neighboring Orange County SoCal, there’s ton morons many count. won’t able make rent Honest question: think framers Constitution, proposed first past post concept, doomed America failure? California anti-vaxxers go die? Following basic protocols assume. that’s case, picture eventually start presenting rising positivity rates rather rising case numbers. Clusterfuck.

Is better? Leroy Jenkins 😂 never cleared many Americans obsessed bedazzled cloth masks university experts Hong Kong discourage reusable masks tested devised simple 3-ply, no-sew disposable homemade mask made paper towel, tissue, masking tape rubber band everyone America access to. mask said 90% effectiveness surgical mask. look pretty surely filters better cloth  Even $199 absurd enough. $6408? Seriously? Texas half population Kids age look reason party there’s plenty leaders country telling it’s fine want. Expect Trump take jab Toronto mayor, it’ll probably backfire. Wow, realized people's problems stem overestimated view competency world leaders. Maybe like Trump he's clearly incompetent, know ever successfully organize anything. Without boost rent major cities isn’t payable. see massive rent strikes. Close .. own, Rural areas safer.  I'm waiting happen areas tbh rich fled urban cities cottage/second house/whatever own... travel back home eventually commute really start shit rolling. somewhat ironic lot places little data ""contact tracing"" work even mandatory.

Bottom line, people can, put kids private schools, isolated summer camps, etc. afford wait millions savings, course near typical family. significant amount SARS patients never recovered. still diminished lung function ""ground glass"" issue lungs. ended pulmonary fibrosis. Early death among ""recovered"" SARS patients fairly common, studies estimated took roughly 17(? Can't recall 100%) years life people it. Jesus christ asshole  apply American citizens outside US past months? Top time it, I’m sure time give career advice... Canadian government study worldwide prisons right abstract, recall, said ""we're using US model"". bad thing. focus that

you focus since seem understand concept excess mortality. Remind 12 days love you’re downvoted presenting facts contrary narrative lol there’s Alberta. Bro mad lol Expats coming home also gave big boost repatriated, Quebec *lot* snowbirds. July. going half year. America, sort shit mate. Im SD, LA, people good masks distancing recent protests. Too, County says clusters community outbreaks restaurants intimate settings, protests outdoors.. recalled banned, people allowed cause shortage meant healthcare providers first responders. Google YouTube people attacked wearing N95 100% situation. People wearing masks threat personal public health fuck people act like customer little snot-nosed kids. wonder impact organ donation long term. Years people recovered CV19 die, may start seeing shortage viable organs donations. lasting impacts infections yet realized.  Lmao, totally forgot. Damn needed acting way? Lmao ya right. Greatest country earth literally every field. USA HOE. hope get big fat social welfare check great conservative leader.  confirmed cases sources people outliers? sometimes. UK data they’ve decided left similar spikes reason No. minimum wage isn’t. laughable. People legitimately pulling masks fake repetitive sneezing knowingly around proponents mask usage - say experience. 'Murica! think maybe “got” used past tense, friend already recovered


Whatever word recovered counts right regards COVID. wear mine whole shift it’s hard don’t medical condition. anxiety disorders peep nose periodically absolutely one around, that’s it. Regardless, appreciate recognizing privilege; essential workers aren’t working want to, need money survive weren’t lucky enough get paid unemployment actually working. Stay safe Texas opened indoor dining believe March 1. Cases didn’t start going June. Takes time people get sick, tested, etc. pretendimg responsibility poor literally impossible; prepare worldwide pandemics months happen. 

How blame people things so, obviously fault? guess plain stupid.  everyone turned news would much better place. used respect other's opinions. politicians media outlets feed division encourage divided country. Well pointing fact sub extremely biased Sweden. 

Where what’s experience Swedish racism? genuinely interested Seems like WWE getting sense danger actually staged  could put cages near border, maybe?

The U.S.A. great wide variety inhumane, worse-than-prison methods lock people terrorize country, e.g. owning Casio watch trying work farm hands U.S.

Now Covid showing true terrorists are, could finally put methods better use. effective propaganda campaign put fascist element decades. talented spokespersons worth every cent pay them, know push buttons. know make followers feel like VICTIMS. That's easy way lot people right wing knows this. basically done build right wing army get voters elect politicians simply give well connected entities special deals tax breaks. trapped work situations listen right wing propaganda radio saw right though it.

People, RUSH LIMPBALLS FRIEND. EVERYTHING TELLING KEEP ENSLAVED. ANYONE ELSE'S FAULT LIFE GOING WAY IS. CONTROL DESTINY. FREEDOM POWER SUCCEED. ONE KEEPING IT. TOLD ONES WANT KEEP ENSLAVED.

Break free propaganda oppression That's Polis shut bars today. want out-of-state people coming holiday weekend (and beyond) spreading it. Use iron. Hey fuck you. perfectly happy falling asleep right now. want wings. locked abroad probably better witnessing mental carnage goes daily basis. Ask someone wear mask want go war it. mom still relatives Malaysia. Might head whenever there's sort calm. buddy 34 extremely fit. think many times higher that. I’m basing fact 100% people know who’ve passed. :( Respectfully, NY sent people symptoms back care homes instead isolating NY things well, reason NY leads nation Covid deaths. Dan Crenshaw says worry fucking idiot Essential worker here. Can’t speak rest them, pull nose ONE around. claustrophobic OCD, able breathe fresh air periodically gives panic attacks, can’t really work. said, second someone shows up, even they’re behind me, like I’m facing away them, goes back on. would still 100% wear even weren’t mandated; live state mandated hella early luckily issues there. Child? US Coronavirus Situation 'Very Serious' 'Window Closing' Control It, Azar Warns

the window close closed 3 months ago. child winter time. it. surprised man entirely driven money isn’t taking COVID-19 seriously? Didn’t national leaders also recently put shit ant position get sports going months ago? 

Seems like great recipe success. ask entailed? ""On average, expect room 100 people six infected. 100 people 94 infected. 88 infections dude shared dangerous behaviour. Weirdo Trump reelected officially mark year like worst year (deal) history years (deals) True, there's protection ways, people free ruin health time. Lockdown severe back. 

A lot things open incl offices told Trump president left playbook. Maybe he'd read stuff like this. 🤦🏽‍♀️ government making money, spend it? Trump have, already has, gallons blood hands Denmark reliant shipping. Sure, Maersk large company, hardly contribute anything taxes sold oil division (in fact, Ringkøbing Landbobank pay taxes Maersk), neither much staff tax exempt. Denmark export economy well. Biotech/medical, greentech food important sectors. imagine big real number is. .2% fatality flu CFR, IFR (what you’re referring Covid). CFR death rate diagnosed disease, IFR includes infected, regardless symptomatic may may become. IFR flu tenth (0.02% swine flu). Huge difference. *Albertans Ontarians like Americans care admit. B.C done extremely well. I'd say well 60% everyone see Van wearing mask. Infections deaths going steady awhile now. someone southern state cases gone up, really nervous see states like mass opening up. Hopefully people better masks whatnot I’m really nervous exact thing happen everywhere opens. mONEY prINTEr goES BrR need government coming homes, telling us bodies. 

Why bet people taking attitude people pro-life, telling women can’t bodies? get outvoted... There's another actor drama contradicts Trump big time - Pence. considerable evidence Pence hates Trump's guts, Orange One stuck him. $4800+/mo couple months prepare?(and potentially stimulus) one now. really bad, work normal. 

I think people image frightened overworked employees verge breakdown, really like that. least night shift. go “he thinks it” “he survived” like that? it? think already clear first comment? wear mask? ain't who's getting sick, cares? website really share sentiment you. 

 http://www.floridacovidaction.com  Since apparently live Australia now, guess. That’s happiness. It’s Rona. sent direct message, I’d love hear stopped containing virus spread. idiotic reason people think okay stop putting fire there's flames left, instead holding completely quenched. founded Microsoft FYI.. There's whole lot wrong comment. Good! hope go them!! Tease? tease wife complaint enough toilet whatever need do,  15 0 time Arizona CoVID19 deaths 2.5x curve flattened.

Really don’t get keep trying push outright lies. ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ type person need America, right live happy life. people willingly ignore science tells wearing mask help contain slow spread, going everyone elses right live happy healthy life. End story. Says whiner. employer removed “furlough program” things getting “back normal” told isn’t enough work people work laid isn’t furlough program... sounds like pretty stupid statement. generic options available available sale now. not. isn’t typical drug situation brands charge advertising generic available cheaper option. That’s what’s happening here. story clearly says generic option available patents run allowing generics. Good job, sensible reopening. Gyms, bars nail salons first. Partly large number susceptible old people.

Partly ""every man themselves"" mentality.

Partly prevalence tourism.

Partly glaring lack intelligence.

I give you, perfect storm. Trump suxx.

Everyone knows this. Worst president ever.

Still excuse Fauci. Wait. Texas Medical Association sponsor political event? in, donates money? sponsor sick peeps? overworked medical staff? real, need start protesting stuff too. Awful. truly politicize every thing can’t we? Hasn’t death rate dropped dramatically? go controversial comments get real conversation data? Buy bitcoin  find weird impressed upon virus actually feels exactly does. Yes research it, feel like plain everyone scary get. hear much that. can't really compare influenza vaccine changes. vaccine best guess strain prevalent year needs close in-door dining gyms. ...by putting price it? photo look like he's holding press conference front motel, quickie crack-whore at? Five months Banana Republic wakes up?  would want hold back stats lie people? Except consumption-based service economy still crater virus rampages uncontrollably throughout country, lockdown not. Especially people scared death leaving homes  Didn’t fucking say second outbreak unlikely? anyone know fuck going ? Increasingly worried we’re going mandated turn air conditioning studies showing easily spreads virus.

Honestly, let play round Russian Roulette COVID instead going sleepless, hellish months sauna heat. Sorry working hospital whole shit zero sympathy paid babies. don’t show up, something instead talk. Oh yeah forget bright pet rock think fixated feeling get telling good ghost story. Michigan easy available get tested. Guess depends. whenever want think ok, planners got this.....the UK 4 years work Brex-it..... Huh.. kinda like wearing mask part protect humans around - regardless believe COVID-19 not? Considering data showing biggest problems among young people, adults, maybe time celebrities use influence young people. There’s restaurant called Sabai Thai Hypoluxo Rd that’s amazing. miss see much.  Yes recently discovered Sturgill well. Love songwriting authenticity. 
 recently got turned onto Struggle Jennings (not Shooter Jennings fyi) Struggle Jennings real name William Harness. Anyway step-grandson Waylon Jennings. hear old country music also mixed modern rhythms beats. lit first time listened. Often give musical artists go arounds. braingasms begin. 
 Give listen. think find refreshing multitude genre blends creations.  do, hope virus takes stupid. Last year’s flu vaccine approximately 20-30% effective. partner vaccinated got flu.

I hope CDC others explicitly clear everyone COVID vaccine guarantee won’t contract COVID-19. it’s rocket science

No. unquestionably difficult. FYI record Belgium 10 days total lockdown. kind lockdown nothing open asked leave house. brief period start seeing ""Tr--p 2020"" face masks. see many now. wonder kind mask die hard Tr--p supporters wearing now. risky group large assemble. know precautions others taking, any.

It's stupid risky. denial I'm seeing suffer serious consequences covid-19. article mid April, bit date way assessing national trends. Dude it’s local station affiliated fox channel shows. Learn shit works remain 100,000 cases per day country cannot process 100,000 tests per day. that, know it. second this!! 🙏🏼 americans even take it? act like there's one straw break camel's back. We've deluged straw since 2017. People seem keep taking it. country beyond repair. scary even thinking it. next decade lot washout human beings, trend holds up.  found format refreshing...two thumbs several states like Florida Texas etc seeing spike cases anyone know hospitals states doing. seen surge covid admissions Moron. stop internet... Nah.

120K dead.

Not simple ""Fauci excused""

This human life talking about.  already mandatory wear mask people often ignoring quote man think sang best:

"" walk talk like field hand, boots I'm wearing cost three grand, write songs riding tractors, comfort private jet ""

Seriously, "" Six pounds lack food / ya try walking shoes"" hard line swallow man reported 6 mil net worth really wants get back selling tickets.

""F\*\*k ears I'm pandering, write songs people do, Jobs towns I'd never move to""

Indeed. saw someone point day people bitching wear masks, demanding let patios drink also tend crowd tip. overworked staff places getting double whammed seems. I’d argue it’s case desensitized, feeling overwhelmed helpless anything. kept insisting going nothing without anything it, knew trouble.

When people around claimed hot weather would kill virus own, knew *major* trouble. worldometers +46,000 day. increase 10,000 last tuesday.

i want wade lower fatality rate not...but lot cases need die out..including secondary infections.

schools re-open *6 weeks* places. hero need right now! Join proud American club.. growing none us know it. look like absolutely spoiled brats here. live state particularly bad job I'm giving serious consideration moving another state it. infection rate high would putting family risk trying make move happen. Without getting political question. numbers cases countries much lower US? mean really even close. countries doing? mandatory masks? constitution.

It's part human decency. like corna, country music care infects survive. Yoooo, gets bad enough could effect number seats hot spot states house?!? shows face, neck, chest. Theres denying it. work woman also features woman trust me.. morbidly obese. eats fast food lot gets largest combo size. sleep apnea, borderline diabetic, sky high cholesterol. get virus, guaranteed she'll hospital ventilator. India's situation unavoidable due high population density. Yes known stopping pandemics one different. said delay spread they're probably prepared.  3 family members 3 different hospital systems Wisconsin. Supplies expensive administration able get them. fear things get much worse soon. feel like may never want talk another human person again. Encounters like one describe incredibly frustrating. talk someone like that, immediately lose interest ever talking again. There's part realizes people stupid one way, still decent people ways. literally explaining one person's refusal follow cautionary rules spell death (or horrible suffering) others... care all? really can't live without going bars churches while? They're ok knowing people might die needed birthday party? can't make adjustments lives greater good? come point nobody cares anyone else's well-being anymore? always like this, see it? I'm literally losing hope. wish lots luck enforcing it. People going get friends /family home enforcement fail. Cops want become mask police /stay home police etc. Sure close business stop spread. cat bag putting back nearly impossible Come Abbott, let us save fucking murderer Mass stupidity though? One person stupid, sure. couple? Unfortunate. feels like that.

I following political side closely all, counterargument came mind. Italy NY studies best ones date, unfortunately infection rates found 10x level. closer 6-7x, still high lot lower. also needs pointed level testing point time waaaay behind places now. confirmed vs actual probably lot closer 3-5x rather 6x+ earlier. 

What I've found works pretty well use 1% IFR baseline since really consistent places done antibody tests. Take current day deaths x 100 = daily cases 7 days prior, multiply number x 2.5 (roughly 5-day doubling time atm, change gets control. Eventually going back 2-3 day doubling saw early on). 

So todays numbers would get approx 191k cases today (764 x 100) x 2.5

It's super rough lined well antibody testing seems realistic 30% asymptomatic / 10% hospitalized see. order get stuff like 10x higher current confirmed cases need like 50-60% cases present symptoms, meaning hospitalizations stuff actually 1-2% cases. Antibody testing kind shot theory hell though. Unless plan leave everyone lockdown indefinitely, course there’s going cases COVID lockdown ends. thought idea lockdown first place slow transmission prevent hospitals overwhelmed allow supply PPE (somewhat) catch back up.

The alarmist articles somewhat missing point. Public health care experts expecting see surge things opened up. question whether surges within acceptable limits. looked Arizona's numbers? Also remember much early pandemic completely missed lack testing. know certain exposure earliest deaths 21 days. spike started three weeks ago, already seeing spike deaths start, right time. Look Arizona's numbers, around Yes. Go ahead, feel it. I'm paywalled see article, data available time? these?

 address many hospitalizations would be? test someone they're executed. see met roommates. Perhaps one people outside house invited hang with. INSIDE DAMN HOUSE. I'll bite.

Ok. constitution negative document, cite it? citing it, citizen suggesting positive right. valid argument would say law saying can't something. Yeah, they're find better success putting people stomachs pure oxygen breath, rather ventilators exacerbate damage virus causes lungs. anybody explain many parts USA rush reopen? slight economic recovery necessary? seems grossly irresponsible. Make make sense. nominate everyone involved spectacular decision Darwin Award! One friends called sheep days ago telling masks important. Reminder: 2.5 million confirmed US cases, 130,000 - roughly 5% - died. 100,000 confirmed cases per day x 5% Case Fatality Rate 5,000 deaths per day. Death trailing indicator expect figures month reach case figure. 2.5 million confirmed cases, innovation test going move needle much. solid sample size measure expectation. really going change 20%.

And say ""what undetected cases?"": Sure. Multiply confirmed cases 10, 900,000 presumed cases + 100,000 confirmed .5% Infection Fatality Risk mortality still 5,000 deaths per day.

Also, actual deaths excess mortality historical average double reported Covid deaths. Whether that's limited access healthcare whatever, historically still count death toll.

We're looking ugly summer. Things warming might expecting summer ebb slow things down. No. summer ebb. Covid season looks like. kids go back school go back indoors find Covid peak season looks like. Covid Coronavirus. Coronavirus literally common cold. Covid common cold turned fatal. DayQuil charge over. need working sick hero year. sick go home stay least two weeks. 

For sake people, wear mask. Stop breathing other. Wash hands, especially get home. confined space people live unless absolutely must. Think smelling someone's breath exchange bodily fluids: intimacy reserved private spaces committed relationships exclusivity. open sexually usually, take break social good. Karma baby. Get kicks Zoom whatever over.  I've embraced pandemic pudge. gyms closed work buttered popcorn off? Every day new fresh hell. 620 Hospitalisations means 124 deaths unless treatment improved since April.
20% people hospitalised die. Might want wait longer contagious human Floridatoday.com man. even click link. types treatments forefront, given there's large global population unsure rapid vaccine effective way detrimental. Treatment and, ideally, form minimization Covid side effects likely realistic path pandemic. Rapid vaccine development going tough sell lot people, that's outside anti-vaxxers imo. people deserve authoritarian police state currently live in. ~~disappointed~~ terrified 85 College Athletes die every year average. play schools sports programs relying football. Crunker True! I'm going try remember that. May well model President tells people inject cleaning fluids. like... US right now. people special. natural. We're together. case count low RIGHT NOW. gave case study NY handle virus hurts watch states ignore man. fear them. Th “unspecific” antibody tests. shouldn’t used COVID19 screening, aren’t used serological studies/screenings. 

Again. goal posting CDC page?  Seee even thread conflicting stories. Anyone work hospital? it? actually full?

edit: video/article posted clears bit. bad bad 100% capacity. takes 10 states daily numbers like Florida. Come on. fair President. misquote cheap internet points.

You *inject* bleach. That's way worse. Imagine something meaningful Jan-Feb instead mid March? hardly guidance encouragement things right. instance, think would public service announcements warning Fourth July parties no...things move normal. Communication channels bad throughout June. get it. exhausting. hell. keep moving get us solid ground damn chance. Missed prom walking stage smh surprise literal smartest state country right things got hit... continue to. best hospitals country also helps. mention yet sports teams superior others? That's complete bullshit. Test positives maybe, many multiples based asymptomatic carriers never never tested. mention finally getting away hydroxychloroquine obsession. Fuck military.

I can't bomb way fucking pandemic could really fucking use resources right hospital. Awesome...now throw minimal actions best taken stop thing right now, increased testing holiday weekend know shit ants going go mass pack ignoring whole thing Fauci’s warning 100k cases day could arrive true within matter weeks Yes, seems like right thing do. I'll wait weeks.  recently found friend mine sure safety vaccines. friends family back home aniti vaxers sees alot false info Facebook. told bit torn believe. think anti vaxers crazy set ways go that's surrounded might proper education upbringing differentiate facts fake news. ""together"" even word American?  think many others misunderstanding saftey virus works. people country without state borders travel restrictions good you. don’t get it. damn hard. It’s seriously like dealing CHILDREN Please say that. kill hope one day leave awful country. live California, hospitalizations due covid 40% last 2 weeks. doctors getting plenty experience learning treat virus, nothing celebrate. talking contact tracing 50 positives per day requiring 50k tracing tests. We're talking 50k positives requiring 50000k tracing tests. words, contact tracing would require 100k+ new workers dedicated constantly testing tracing, administering 500 tests each. would never want live Canada put front human rights tribunal said something someone like.

[Citations much needed] Oh god yeah, case like that, cya! Thanks info, I’ll check out! Glad it’s named Covid2019 🤔  could locked hard singular federal policy, enforced strict social distancing, mask wearing narrowed definition “essential worker” people genuinely needed out, would now.

This truly ridiculous see. Even Canada rough start delayed lockdowns look pulling now. USA done same, guys would opening safely re-lockdown. mind boggling. Ah! Please stay safe friend! mechanism viral protein presented immune system unknown. concern risk viral protein recognized ""self"" causing immune tolerance virus want. mechanism elucidated enough n reached I'll wait. paper international, student-run, intended unbiased, pretty good book reviews. definitely keeper. mechanism viral protein presented immune system unknown. concern risk viral protein recognized ""self"" causing immune tolerance virus want. mechanism elucidated enough n reached I'll wait. US whole fucking deplorable. However, since govt federal level failed, it’s worth noting New York select states handled best could. don’t stand Cuomo, do/has damn decent job Covid. county we’ve 0 new deaths, we’re getting towards less less infection, we’ve well reopening. still wear masks, life returning slowly normal. Also banning travelers certain states haven’t given fuck this. Can’t downvote enough. Welcome military still get paid lmao Depends covid area. cases rise control? Personally I'd wait weeks see things go. Like gyms opened back probably best wait weeks see covid cases start rise remains control. mean could months time covid cases start rise like we're seeing Texas etc could cases remain control decades US subsidized low prices drugs low income countries, anyone condemn bulk buying drugs middle pandemic unfair pricing long laughable. around 2:40 Dr Fauci addressing this

Basically coordinating public private research improve testing. anything increased research COVID vaccine traditional initial path vaccines 

The risks taking financial risks. heath / safety ones. Oh anti-mask crowd definitely taking treatments get if/when get sick. primary disease selfishness. understand point.

I understand important.

I cannot help you. I'm sorry. Shocker ""Why anything like exist???"" someone apartments hadn’t paid rent coronavirus get lucky court shut day got bumped.

So proceeds rub manager gloat, basically, course continuing pay nothing. everyone else pay, guy.

Then courts reopen he’s naturally one first ones up. wants time collect money. cost us five months rent, one penny paid. No, man, enjoy five free months go.

That said rent collections us great. 70ish units, four people didn’t pay duration coronavirus. Two paid everything owed evictions resumed. One others person mentioned. fourth manager Popeyes (so job intact) said lawyer advised pay rent would forgiven. No.

We live state unemployment payments went fast furious, though, relatively people cash-strapped long.

But overall braced disaster ended business usually couple oddballs. However, chance positive result means antibodies infection virus family viruses (called coronaviruses), one causes common cold.  remember NY broke 1000 cases total, broke 1000 day. 

Now daily totals Florida/Texas/Cali daily numbers even phase anymore. EXPECT it. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Understandable, thanks! think stop blaming that.

It's masks specifically, trusting government general.

They took advantage people's trust, betrayed them. less trust. US 4th place almost certainly forced close proximity probably couple hundred people I'm lucky. I'm plunged danger zone whether like not. state cared safety since April. hey, gotta starve get evicted, right? Fuck everything.

I know tomorrow celebration too. Judging current events probably safer me, thank god. guys celebrate Canada Day (aside Canada)? What's whole thing about? Well get fucking wrecked maybe work Magic Johnson route help poor people eventually. love state, currently fucked. Maybe McMaster play another song guitar make us feel better.  That's killed back March April. got amigo. Numbers blast shutdowns already started again, matter time... right? RIGHT?!?!?  Caramba Don't. dozens better stocks agree there's much back forth they're opening things they're closing things people dying ....make way way across board get done already. we'll get cinema sins MST3k every pandemic movie. know G4 name failed TV station video games? name dumb. Missed couple birthdays I'm still staying home hopefully start fucking annihilating bitch ass virus Hey, I've seen one! classic! worth it? Also, undergrad live toronto well. Work bar, maybe 1 40 tables someone mask. go lcbo grocery store. going get second wave 100% scared. Bye Oh god. 

I don’t know else say guys. Even patented, government override. provision Australian Patents Act allow gov compulsorily acquire patent (with mention compensation). 

So companies try play hardball, may lose IP rights perpetuity.

Needless say provision never used (yet) message real quick. Thinking getting career field Damn sound like elective surgery. Got it. Interestingly, people distinguished careers prior becoming science communicators. Somehow doubt OP's friend claim same. Rona freedumbs fun..... Yup, exponential growth really really doesn’t fuck around. trend back March doubling every 10 days so, far limited testing compared happened states already started lock downs. Throw happening yet, way testing ***and*** holiday weekend mix? could within 2 weeks honestly, yet I’m still getting chirped idiots RemindMe bot. intention shooting anyone, also intention becoming victim. fight me, fight you. Washington one first states hit mandatory masks until... 4 days ago, June 26th. Things opening since first week May lol... actual document 24 pages got clever innuendo....nice one. Tom Brady leaving gave us resolve needed fight. that, prepared anything.

Boston strong. Lord Flies style lol one theory . Another another lock end majority service industry's businesses. Lots restaurants theaters writing year. many survive another three month lockdown?

It seems bullet head heart far economy goes. 

That said. People important money. right American country good sense desire keep Covid control shunning US. would. would solution employee antagonized angry customers, escalated prolonged confrontations, environment people coming back murdering employees? Americans literally squandered 3 months time

""We""? would lump everyone Trump, Oxford vaccine based years vaccine research shown minimal short term side effects Yeah... that's hoarding masks exactly kind stupid shit Americans would do.

How exactly reflect badly him? guys 5th global pandemic, fuck done life?  Yes, agree completely... feel like young less risk 50 year olds case. Explains stuff suppose quote early April, lareJune China need blacklist US. Americans would refuse use Chinese made vaccine regardless safe efficacy. 

If china indeed first develop effective vaccine, Americans would surely screw distrust paranoia Chinese.

I already see outcry Fox News government workers injecting Chinese made vaccine American children nutcase anti vaxx conspiracies spawn. 

My prediction regardless whether China developed vaccine, US wait one American European firms develop vaccines inoculating population. right middle predicted range deaths mitigation?

The fact people negatively affected give shit people are, could be.

We pulled back curtain, mirror shows us shallow selfish petty ignorant fools.

And gonna get worse Fuck. Florida. Tuesdays pretty much always highest day week since it’s finally get accounting weekend numbers. avid runner, put good 7-10 miles day. I'm SoCal absolutely blows mind much elderly people area care. went way get old guys way mask went way get new path. Cool dude trying punish wearing mask peak health? going work smart guy. I've situations like lately truly get it.

I realize lot people wearing outside, put everytime going pass within 6 feet, makes sense me. running going pass right someone find highly likely could easily spread droplets without mask. Even mask back fuck up. Oblivious people get within inches without mask really pissing off. good job locking down, significantly slowed spread outlined clear plan reopening... didn’t really follow guidelines reopening. set benchmarks counties start transition new phases, Los Angeles (which cases from) progressing toward reopening despite really hitting benchmarks. 

On top that, LA active protests. don’t know much protests actively led spread, I’m pretty confident saying focus got pulled away COVID people started getting way lax. addition, California’s shutdown also somewhat undercut Arizona open business (Arizona 4-5 hour drive LA know least people decided go Arizona mini-vacation wS “open”). fact currently. Europe barred US citizens. Canada restricted well. go Russia like, they're pretty chummy president. Negative noise I'm NYC metro area.

You're around early April.

Let tell you, July going *fucking suck* Texas. mention word b l u e states get auto deleted political responding comment states GOP it’s allowed. Insane they're *right there* man. border nearly closed needs be. America right next door like hiring Typhoid Mary personal Chef careful wash hands. Love live Toronto Vancouver. CNN talking Texas, Arizona, Florida every 5 minutes. news usually watch? Everything said true, evidence Reddit cesspool don’t know could possibly look US right say we’re *too much* stop virus. Well countries like France, U.K. fall ongoing transmission restrictions entry United States


While countries like N.K., Cuba fall ongoing transmission without restrictions entry United President Trump's proclamations shuttering U.S. travel tourism Presidential proclamations established restrictions entry certain travelers United States effort help slow spread coronavirus disease 2019 maybe travel U.S. N.K. nothing virus spam bot people know also needed fly past three weeks. Flights major airlines packed. given option change flights charge, close full well. doubt, maybe cynical old fuck, think 'ain't seen last this' yet. I’m confused comment, could elaborate. Tuesdays usually highest number tbf. Although cases much less weekend pattern deaths.  Californian, yes. deaths won’t happen rate. 225,000 Jan. 1. Still horrendous. found HODLer “Awful country”. Lmao. sound like whiny little brat. hooking  trying understand making ""we're going die"" post, so, cite article ~100 young people got COVID, none hospitalized, 1/3 asymptomatic.

You proving Desantis' point, buddy.

Edit: way edit post pointing ridiculous without noting ""Edit"" said post. clearly new d00merism Reddit. Well, protests okay, right. mass gatherings allowed. safe cause car. Thanks think depends cut day.

yeah, worldometers count shows non record. still showed quite sizable increase last tuesday.

i'm sure relevant is...beating record not. lot states finding cases ease. knows real number actually is. least Brave New World would working mine digging ditches. Well know? History repeats again? fucking thing happened 1918 Spanish Flu. 

The health experts right well. 

Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, etc ***wasted*** portion Two Trillion dollar stimulus package supposed allow lock down, prepare measures, reopen safe timely basis.

Success means ignorance Berkeley breath fresh air, everyone wearing masks cross street avoid you. Heaven I'm honest.  Yeah worry cases rebounding. Hope really best numbers stomp outbreaks comprehensive contact tracing. government already track anyone god damn dunce. Trudeau moron real. It’s nice knowing good niece lives Miami, 100 cases/day closed apartment, seeing anybody except husband daughter, weeks. 8000 new cases day keeps sending photos family beach, restaurant, etc. people follow crowd regardless common sense.

De-escalation customer service issue. Well, know, wall southern border, real border north...

Although id suggest taking control East West coast shrink *UNITED* states middle bits, ejecting trump voters there. Lmfao. Idiots. You’re referring idiots. wish people would see stories like this. live Pennsylvania-Pittsburgh. want impeach governor keeping things restricted throughout state longer period states.  Southwest Pa especially numbers lower. even hospitals doctors Pittsburgh saying- fine. mild cases. Mostly affecting elderly. I'm waiting wrong numbers go ""mostly open."" Nothing else say YES! Thank you. too. Thanks forcing staff hospital waste PPE (plural) US still seeing shortages PPE. Hopefully finally help keep illegals Neither current one. Less week ago math population size vs new cases day found states 8.5x population 105x new daily case #, awful. Today, looking again, 160x. numbers varying enough make pretty big range, even still that's pretty horrifying, gap getting wider time goes on. lot morons everywhere. 3. one made masks vs masks you.

The advice always 3. remember saying: mask replace social distancing social distancing replace mask. mean degrade teachers, keep seeing comments parents sound like might putting tasks area really need to. They're kids. Parents focus critical skills get overwhelmed content.

I said basic math well. think 8 hours classes every day necessary kids come okay, certainly parents need recreate that. Subject-specific information either specifically important (they could study one historical period well another), repeated depth later years.

That's true elementary education, even university level, subject often matter. Women's Studies leave similar skills would get History degree.

So comes parents worrying COVID disruptions, happen stay course, learning dates, matching names acts, even exactly plants grow. progress reading, writing, math skills important future academic success. Thought August September market crash. October ends. Clearly that’s working well guys.  plus Disney. Florida government honestly might survive Disney make money. Ironically, they'll likely open Disney cause massive spike, forcing everyone cancel plans anyway. Gives new life term “flu like symptoms” keep quiet, went swimming public pool waiting test results, fucking idiot! No. go cdc well. saying Florida hiding covid numbers calling pneumonia instead. cdc isn’t saying that. fact even happened pretty disgusting, retook hazmat training people dont believe modern medicine chucking blood around terrible combo. good know clickbait. sub? trying cause bs panic. Ridiculous.  Duped That's part problem. would surprised considered elective surgery. I'm expert hopefully mislead, made aware anything immediately life threatening considered elective.

Brain tumor could grow inoperable tumor eventually kill you? Elective.   Mainly windows used laminate glass would impossible smash window escape vehicle emergency. know ""hospitalized happens covid"" classified ""hospitalized covid""?

This literally happened friend mine YESTERDAY. Houston; admitted hospital chronic stomach issue life, take mandatory test admitted. covid (asymptomatic), forever classified ""hospitalized -- covid"" even though idea even freaking it.

And that's we're going see hospitalizations go roof. people start going back elective procedures, they'll join statistics. Soon they'll announce plan personally take money American's savings fund eleventy gajillion dollar bailout, somebody explain president real number I'm sure totally shout fake news. quick look YouTube, pyramid graph :47, saying 1.5% land hospital, 0.35% die, rest treated outside (no symptoms via home care doctors).

This unstressed conditions course. bit people forget happens let go. get happen Texas, Florida like. important thing condemn repeat history."" 

Arizona politicians 2 months ago "" Yes do, COVID stuff fake. see!""

Arizona politicians ""we're repeating history like learn hard way"". Accuracy 2 tests always low. 

Also, annecdotal patient surveys indicate mild cases may mount enough immune response ping IgG IgM antibodies, even centers likely using reliable tests. Hospitalized “severe” cases appear likely show positive antibodies

by token, there’s speculation mild asymptomatic cases may spread virus effectively anyway.

It changes constantly, one snapshot report. time much information many walking around infected, infecting others, whether immunity conferred sustained, whether types immunity aren’t testing protective things antibody.

I would look numbers know they’re off, usually. thing look at, IMO, always going hospitalization trends, want know area doing. Three layers recommended opposed two layers said enough. Keeping open isn’t realistic, right. Lockdowns really possible peoples’ needs met. 

This colossal failure Feds. $1200 check; bump UI running you’ve since start this. people haven’t even gotten either yet whatever reason. joke.

Meanwhile $1.2 trillion+ big business.  Thanks! I'll take look that! Thank much thoughtful thorough response. definitely anti-vax family nervous reluctance may sounded like common bullshit waxed deny science. I've tried comfort arguing likelihood major side-effects probably low that, reality, probably better low risks vaccine-related side-effect almost certain probability catches highly contagious disease, probably survive it. common cold landed hospital before, needs physical assistance cough, almost died last year doctors- despite disagreement SMA specialists- put appendectomy, find lungs almost weak function afterward. risks going vaccine free vastly outweigh becoming vaccinated. hope happens soon safely possible.... I’ve seen movie Yes mom alum Cornell got email saying opening Cornell yesterday. pretty much concluded desperately need money Ithaca (the city Cornell located) would collapse students faculty etc. keep Ithaca financially stable. Without school open many businesses close (or closing already know one place went business). think Cornell knows they’re saying it’s safe go back person learning. definitely don’t think it’s good discussion. know Obama gif Someone asks really stupid question kind like frowns throws hands like dude fuck?

That's did. Wrong Dan Patrick? Thats legendary ex sports center host.

Dont get wrong listening experts this, thats wrong dan Patrick  Well, they've *checks notes* 5 months prepare. 

Of course, prepare 'hoax'? slow anything like country getting police help without form bribe monumental task. Ew. Masks mostly protecting people.

Don’t anything better lol 'paper'.

The 2 hour youtube video head cdc discussing virus 0.50 mark, shows detailed statistic shows 98% infections go without barely symptoms. 


This coming mouth. looks like prison tattoo!  Actually China requiring meat imported US COVID-free. actually hurting US exporters Chinese consumers. 26 y/o airlifted another clinic plasma treatment vent. 40 y/o weeks NIV barely recovered. head physician die vent (ski tourist). seen GP still needs oxygen concentrator home now, weeks discharge.

Had whole ICU filled cases, flu season 1 flu patient max. 

And live region country managed well.

Maybe shut mouth, know nothing. brain infested conspiracies. I'll trust doctors random YouTube channels. Really?! camp? cannot believe parents would send kids that. Tesla produce EV others may hybrid/EVs still producing millions ICE cars year contributing massively climate change "" Donald J. Trump, approve message"" fucking idiot shows percentage tests coming back positive, amounts thing. Also see hangout therapies let's honest. OT PT effective virtually. Also ton IEP provisions least NY put allow exceptions therapy. school prove gave reasonable effort. Dude wrong. June 6th number people claiming UI benefits 30,553,817. still averaging like 1.5 million people filing weekly Gov Abbott shut bars states slowing reopening, we're gonna see filings jump.

Nothing normal. I'm glad affected workwise, good deal us shitshow here. drug going sold regardless. Doesn’t effect stock price bought US rather countries/buyers. It’s pretty much MO states. Pretend nothing wrong hope goes away. 

Both governors loyal trump. promised. Covid would go away randomly. Like miracle It’s quite simple “well they’re still learning”. lot depend affluence school district. example, mom lives schools already assigned middle high schooler tablet books loaded onto lectures available download. Now, cousin teaches disadvantaged neighborhood. less quarter students able attend class given day. Usually one computer house, parents still needed work, parents worked outside home older kids relied watch younger siblings kids also taken parents work. students rely school library internet access, obviously available. virus taken seriously ramifications missed 18 months education serious too, belong organization uses Facebook primary method communicating members. I've heavily using Facebook's block feature almost like back early days college students around age (at time) access it. I've actually looked choice times (as opposed checking posts group mentioned) ever since blocking anti-science morons racists. paid 300 euro return ticket, booked yesterday. boats already quite full, take one late night. That's low bar clear (sadly)  global warming continues people forced leave homes relocate. includes cities wrecked rising waters, case middle East North Africa, brutal heat leading kinds problems especially agricultural issues.

Those going press Europe. aggravate growing populism. seen Indian weddings? Everybody would touching buffet cutlery. hope companies Europe China come vaccine. US monopolize vaccine too, would really screwed. 5 years working kids boss called office one day said, ""by way, looking full time pastorate last 4 months. found one start 2 weeks. last paycheck."" asked several times something needed find new job try raise financial support. repeatedly told no, growing.

Having suffered manner abuse child cannot work kids, refuse work missionary groups churches ever again. Everything found near home sort ""only kids white, American church."" Basically SBC youth pastor jobs. thanks.

And old warehouse work A/C. So, found job SC working kids system. Anyone else wish restaurant owner, employee, got Covid-19? interview done weeks back think much changed since then. Sir John Bell works closely Oxford vaccine. Rick-Roll got rick-rolled reddit, cant compete lol u/Undeleteparent mean worldwide phenomenon specific Florida. Less people dying March April there's lot theories is.

- Better treatment
- Better protection old people
- Lower viral loads people least distancing mask wearing (especially Miami, people well behaved)
- Virus become weaker time
- Less people dying weather gets warmer (in northern hemisphere anyway)

I really see evidence Florida anything wrong. walk get test like twice already time. get result back within 3 days publish statistics website. know, seems pretty legit me. 

There's literally proof claims sub true. People keep saying ""Florida reducing testing"", ""florida hiding results"", ... etc etc. none actually makes sense take 5 minutes look data Florida Health website.

I'm foreigner living Florida, maybe I'm missing point, hate seems pretty unwarranted. Honestly people fucking us tourists states coming Miami... Maybe dont get married? I've living happily woman 13 years nobody else better us silly ceremony based flawed called religion mythical figures magical powers times right people getting married worse us putting peoples lives risk reason care people dont see ""living sin"". 

And post isnt everyone, I'm glad people arent getting married seeing marriages actually bring way problems ever worth. speaking practice Houston total? WaPo doubling white girl covid sob stories. Maybe so.

That said, stimulus, would seem efficient direct payments recently unemployed. people would otherwise greatly pull back spending likely put right back economy.  ""We've tried nothing, we're ideas!"" Mine drop $167 PUA. pandemic I'd get $45/week.... Lungs often benefitted good oral hygiene/health. people kept preaching “well death rate going down”? glad caught valve. one 'fall field' moments, fun. valve replacement feel perfectly normal. Actually, cardiologist told I'm seen high risk covid, good. know mortality rate 0.26, right? that's CDC said weeks ago; going end way lower that.

The ""everyone"" dozens times \*more\* people already this. starting catch up, months disease already spread country. 

Cases alarming. \*Deaths\* alarming. deaths USA dropping literally 2 months straight. Yesterday reported lowest deaths Tuesday since peak 2 months ago.

Your odds getting really sick ventilator random -- associated risk factors. old? Sick? Fat? Etc. so, YES, probably end ventilator. 
Are young? Healthy? Fit? so, NO, probably worry thing. could heighten profits creating bidding war States. could imagine world like that? leave review mention wear mask warn others taking ride him. that's completely contrary everything that's published. Even Dutch CDC wrong someone misinterpreting saying.

They may lumping mild cases asymptomatic. still come 98% figures I've seen elsewhere. Almost everyone reduce amount meat eat. Americans, especially, cut amount meat eat half (I say American). one biggest things individual climate change, it’s much healthier. Exactly, sickest ever virus swept dorm lived in. escape using bathrooms people puking shitting everything. Unless something drastically changes arent reaching million 2021. took nearly 4 months reach even 150k death rates dropped last 10 weeks. Even ramps back due surge talking 850k death like 6 months. That's realistic all. It’s hot anything outside. mixed girl passable hair texture, features get hidden&amp; protects public safety well don’t time handjob right now. Otherwise, hearing dramatic clusters industries poor working conditions ruthless management (plenty about!). Thoughts welcome.


Public Health authorities afraid people scapegoat/blame population (immigrants and/or minorities) over-represented industries, Covid cases general.

Like North Carolina, 10% population (Hispanic) makes 45% respectfully believe [state government] keeping data public way isn’t stigma blame wouldn’t put Latino,” said Dr. Viviana Martinez-Bianchi Spanish, serves state’s marginalized population task force Duke doctor. “But time it’s problem, it’s necessary protect [the community] data.”

-More meatpacking plants fingers crossed hard 🤞🤞 Older people dumb. Stupidity something easily outgrown. Would've preferred Rick-Roll that, ngl. get feeling September Trump going seeing issue executive order make available. He's crazy enough it, honestly, I'd probably sign get it. Wow man, must really, really tough...

I sincerely hope friend alright. Let's hope positive trend getting better continues.

I also sincerely hope people start take seriously...  Almost like outbreak Italy Arizona occured different times. Okay. Still get annoying bouts breathing problems I'm mostly okay. strange. Idk why, never realized Australia’s population small!
To clear, nothing Australia! extremely jealous country’s approach higher education! Florida going do, elect smart black guy? I'm expert, without eradication, mitigation methods still need place believe; i.e., back ""normal"" without it?  that'd spun fast, could see kicking violence. yeah. shame need Come mods, hellbucket actually IRL head injury.

Honestly, I'm glad. hope keeps saying stuff like this, people starting losing friends family getting sick themselves, look finally realize driveling idiot we've elected. 😂😂😂 keep grasping straws death rate 20%, would nowhere close amount total cases currently have, correct.

Whether like not? Let’s see “new normal” holds Fourth July. Better late never. Hopefully parts state follow suit. Ironic. Or, inevitable. shy 1000 persons killed police US last year - article behind paywall, quick google search finds nothing backing saying (that ~991 armed).

I worked printing 30 years, copyeditor, thank god.

Twenty years spent high end pharma marketing. started there, copy would sent typehouse - including small print prescribing info job. first proofs came back read editor product. would send back corrections. next proof, probably thing - average three went printer. third proof? read LOUD editor three editors followed along set proofs.

Every job include Prescribing Info product equivalent 2 sides 8.5 x sheet, 5 cols per side. info rarely changed YET reset every job. 

I first woman jobs, companies, either. Printing 100% male dominated. aghast inefficiency. one cared cost time yet time judged on. took two years get prescribing info changed using standard copy time.

I say, though, mistakes rarely made print, maybe every years, always headline. job would reprinted, matter cost.  testing, know still around.  figured swine . like white elephant, everyone gets permanent lung damage Earth seem like getting ready us? saying anything contrary that, next comment made someone replied understand people reservations it. However lot people seen concerned right reasons, thinking vaccine started scratch hasnt tested humans period.

In regards Thalidomide babies, heard (and mom born one arm often asked one), admit pretty small group people, dont doubt possibility something like happening, even vastly different way life people still death toll least 500k, possibly millions. Thats vaccine ""rushed"" sense arent waiting years years longterm side affects large varried sample size, point likely minimal affect virus largely run course. N95 I'm Atlanta tell state officially started opening up, businesses, especially restaurants, stayed closed restricted significant way, last two weeks actually started seeing widespread reopenings dining rooms relaxation things like one-way aisles grocery stores, people actually standing full 6 ft. apart, etc. Rate mask wearing varies neighborhood neighborhood now. live outside Pittsburgh farmland. Grocery stores places see masks. stores, especially small business, also auto stores/dollar stores, body wears masks. even employees. 

If got Facebook, join beaver county news alerts Facebook group. good laugh. must say, pleasantly surprised trajectory death counts. Everytime think see signals trend reversing goes right back solid downward trajectory.

I would expected clear evidence trend reversal deaths. Even hotspots I'm really seeing strong evidence increase deaths (record deaths today AZ, alone certainly trend,). Perhaps younger demographic adding extra delay increase. Even increase cases mostly young people, would expect least sight increase deaths risk catching it, nope, nothing.

I still believe cases continue increase are, deaths inevitably follow, especially areas overwhelmed hospitals. I'm pleasantly surprised things thus far.

Here's hoping end aged like milk... need mask outside. ""employee sign submit confirm situation receive **Unpaid** Leave"" yes, 100 people getting disease 100% death rate better 1000000 getting disease 1% death rate,

So think death rate 20%, 100 people would got it?

At point I'm even trying convince anything, making fool every reply want people see it. Musk: Self-driving Teslas go LA NYC end April 30, 2017 1:41 p.m. use self-driving example Musk's achievements here. year two away past 5 years. people may fact go counties, that’s majority. people cook home instead go restaurants. drink home instead go bars. order grocery delivery avoid grocery stores. course people travel elsewhere can’t handle that, definitely reduce number people confined spades without masks. agree defeats purpose, especially many counties shut down. drive 3 counties go bar, bigger problems. take Uber last week, driver put mask got in, time? know sucks... least wear top hat cape well... cases one mining region. decreasing others, including Prague. Vancouver happy city eliminated. Yes deaths lag infection decrease deaths seeing locking country. lag infection deaths appears much longer us anticipated. instance southern states started reopening late April recently seeing surge effects reopenings. could another month see deaths associated that. wearing mask seen sign surrender Trump loyalists, need effort produce masks 'Trump 2020' printed front. Yeah, offensive get knuckleheads wear masks. serious masks social distancing prevent spread? don’t want wear mask, want things back normal. People need start taking responsibility make situation better. FUCK Pence, least he's wearing mask optional Schools, way Gov Newsom wrote mask ordinance. 

I understand Newsom’s mask ordnance leaves wiggle room, don’t blame that. Schools require masks want to, ordnance not. Choosing schools, Newsom. would eliminate *all* active cases, start aggressive testing symptomatic people, contact tracing anyone tests positive, quarantine anyone comes contact someone tests positive. 

In opinion, US big, people move freely, many cooperate contact tracing reasonable option. We're going need vaccine, maybe effective treatment. Lmao, sounds like Mexican parents. opportunity save hundred dollars hospital, needed fill documents. telling bother. bothered, hospital fees waived next year. people state constant embarrassment. mean, curses generally speaking, spell misfortune. could say cursed husband contract covid die seems, many people wedding still fact, living... 

Or broader scale, I'm sure there's people think covid whole curse set onto us. 🤷  Cornell *for certain classes/studies* actually somewhat understand. whole university, that’s completely irresponsible Cornell lot prestigious science courses huge veterinary academy too. former client mine certification “hoods” (biosafety cabinets, Isolators, Fume Hoods, cleanrooms, pharmaceuticals etc) got laid March. students working degrees really *cant* home, type equipment needed studies research students tens thousands dollars require strict protocols annual bi-annual certifications. 

In sense understand. “better society” sounds absolutely bogus me. they’re lobbying students back it’s better bottom line, society. Oligarchs stealing wealth created workers hoarding unconcerned killing people.

Voters vote social programs universal healthcare unconcerned killing people.

Police shown unconcerned killing people.

Close salons restaurants too. Ah, got you. Sorry that. think it’s I’m older mean sound patronizing. apologize. thinking children.

Governors teens. Aren’t teens FL governors blaming!? kids... didn’t think referring 30 year olds. Agreed. people can't even follow instructions wear mask correctly nose mouth...we definitely solving large scale problems anytime soon. I’m ER doc Texas. got call yesterday another hospital crisis. Half staff testing positive. They’ve got tons workers quarantine. I’m currently waiting Emergency Privileges start 3 days. 

In three hospitals currently work would say 2/3 full overwhelmed. Patients holding ER backs ER limits ability accept ambulances. Two hospitals Remdisivir idea get anymore. We’re concerned running Decadron many different conditions need people steroid dependent, die without it. 

We trying get docs community start making patients Code Transport ( personally opposed Slow Codes, abide them). People Reddit already know facilities age related restrictions care. 

It’s struggle. liability reasons don’t write new rules. there’s hush hush talk we’re shift may different last shift. We’re starting hide meds ordering double dose giving one. way someone salvageable comes in, know least one dose. 

It’s fucking shit show. Fuck Musk cars. Looser White House. Basic things don’t register tool. Let’s send back Russia born.  Everyday opposite reports bad is. Thats true ""maybe give 1 Trillion savings Rich?!!!"" - Us govt Freedom Rage Machine? would flipped bird behind back.

Frankly I'm Trumpster... agree people. cannot put lives hold elderly.

The elderly stay frick home allow young, much less likely problems virus, live lives.

Now different **live elderly person someone pre-existing conditions!**

In case bold? damned well stay home, wear mask absolutely go out, wear eye protection well. Full stop there.

If fit category however? Fuggedaboutit.

I keep reminding people crap measles pre-vaccine killed 1/12 infected polio pre-vaccine killed 1/10 infected it.

CoVid? 1/1000.

As much would love say ""People stay home like prisoners!"" cannot degree reasonable thought here.

People keep whining ""Well... hospitals FULL UP!""

I say ""Too bad... increasing hospital capacity past 30 years instead decreasing per-capita!"" hear second stimulus might $4000 travel credit encourage people travel states barring travelers talks so?

Or might $0 encourage people get even desperate *have* find work? 

What gracious country live in! makes say that? lot kids (and teens) rely school programs everything housing food 8+ hours day. daily breakfasts, public transport, extra-curricular activities, even safe housing. takes significant amount time, money, resources educate youth. parents literally time provide adequate home-schooling; resources provide daily breakfast/lunch and/or clothes; resources (internet/books/calculators, etc.) provide education; parents may mental physical capability providing education. incredibly hard many parents, especially trying ride economic tide pandemic, provide home-schooling next months. Additionally, schools refuge abuse; time meet friends time kids teenagers get away home grow develop own. 

It takes village raise child. 

I *do not* personally agree re-opening schools fall. think exponential spread virus school much greater risk downsides; address fundamental problem allowed manifest society:

We turned schools glorified day-cares instances, funneled many youth-care programs school system, system '*pause*' were, creates backlog future issues. lacking infrastructure provide adequate care children external school, economic freedom parents take burden upon themselves.

*If* schools open fall, society come together provide assistance less-able families across nation need help. Wether that's monetary relief funds, free book programs, online classes schools/universities, good neighbor bringing young mother next door pie every while. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since schools publicly funded, would actually make money *less* children went school. Since school's budget 2020-2021 likely already determined state/school board - would making money per head fewer students, also less work. would really become budget problem upcoming school year, later 2021, we'll hopefully virus control. 

Private schools colleges definitely vested interest though... graduated college, youngest bro hounded college come back fall take 4 online classes 1 in-person one *regular fucking tuition*, like $21,000. in-person class he'd swear stay on-campus duration classes (slightly) reduced length. 

He probably going take sabbatical.  voting actually changed anything, would illegal. best hope slow decline rather free-fall Still, going 100 people gathering middle pandemic... I'm American. see anyone social circle nearly 3 months. friends international students leave country see again. able create new social circle pandemic classes online. cancel plane tickets able see parents year, maybe there's second wave. also lost job offer unable pay therapist need treat OCD global pandemic.

Yeah, pretty much sums up. spike coming places like Texas Florida straight open back normal. states like Illinois, cases despite massive protests. explain that? may seem like it, every time wear one help normalize it. Keep good work High positivity rate indication *low testing*, (by itself) high numbers virus. 

With numbers, San Diego 351 new cases per million population Orange County 245 new cases per million. 

So seems SD higher incidence Covid, far better testing numbers. Therefore could also similar incidence rate, OC finding them. Friend, really think wish people die stupid virus? want virus go away, that's happening yet. Agreed unlikely we'll see fatality rate states saw NY know good bit 3 months ago. However, infections states started surging last week so. Hospitalizations areas going significantly. Deaths follow, albeit hopefully extent we've seen New York, Italy, Spain. literally bought 50 pack 30 bucks quit job teach kids day. shifts day shift. Maybe cleaning gene pool bad idea all. paragraph near end article gives pause:

The patients pains normally raise red flags main medical examinations. Schenker said: “We check lung hearts disease, neurological issues. scans can’t see anything, pain — we’re told again.”

So physical scans reveal evidence long term damage. possible patients might instead suffering psychological damage contracted COVID-19? psychological fear manifesting placebo effect pain? know of. said interview metal band high school clicked head describe him.

NY Italy thing. able spread wherever give time opportunity. 

The good side already know lockdowns/social distancing/masks work. suspect masks ultimately make difference. Governors recognizing well starting issue orders. 

I'm optimistic people start taking shit seriously again, know make infection rate drop stabilize situation again. next weeks bad hopefully it'll start taper back again, since people southern states seem taking seriously now.  police people wrong.

Quit please. It’s way higher ups make changes Shut fuck lmfao entire rest world knows wrong insufferable prick Chirp, chirp! that. every kid willing taught parents kids actually like going school. That's pretty much every disaster movie starts. even hilarious realize shit talkers usually young Americans making 6 figures probably working home right now, actualy able shitpost reddit.

Have go live 3rd world country they’ll begging mercy laying bricks $6/hr.  biggest offense telling people stay home, telling businesses close providing citizens regular relief funds

They gave stimulus package everyone also increased unemployment benefits $600 week.

Where getting information providing regular relief funds? went bait tackle shop day talking guy behind counter. said they've selling everything guys come cashing huge unemployment checks going fishing. even even close looking new job amount aid they're getting. Possibly not: tiresome.  Wow somebody needs stop watching Fox News. [We frequently fuck elections nations I'm pretty sure list even close complete.

Of course going read though. fit narrative.

Also lot things mentioned, ended making things worse. Look Middle East turned killed Hussein. Dude menace place basically created ISIS.

Take fellow American; blind nationalism died Nazis. good look. Get grip. Awh shit county red corps highest level cheaters gained. Tbh alot millionaires probably didnt make whole ton woukdnt surpised ride actually broke even lost money. comeback happend fast good reason lack volatility. Unless never sold good chance people didnt guess bottom go back way up. Volatility insane none news worth going on. Right liquidated 2/3rds personal brokerage account heaviex 25 percent 401k. stimulus one way another Ok. don’t need defending nation. invade us, we’ll simply burn White House again, tie like War 1812, win commonwealth Right. Comparing numbers China withholds information India that's 3rd world country downplay severity what's happening country. Fantastic. point gives shit figures look like countries get shit together. Yea direct question of: SIDE BAD? SIDES BAD? gtfo shit. annoying, clearly breaking one main rules here. work free? 💰 individuals Covid back February/March recover, get June? Wtf? nothing race. not. universities money.

After Covid shut universities last semester, students demanded refunds ""didn't pay kind tuition degree University Phoenix."" US refused give refunds, claiming money went pay professors expenses. 

Here's deal though: Many, most, campus universities pay football coaches employee have, usually millions. Without college football playing, paying coaches real football income. soak fuck everyone else cover expense.

Personally, say let sports college die off. designed net massive profits coaches schools exploiting students. Luckily, court cases and, believe, SCOTUS decision stating players compensated use likeness video games stuff. also note that, some, sports way prison pipeline.

The exploitation hits athletes though. Damage permanently problem throughout lives snuff scholarship player can't play, puts students danger rejected school scouted them. also put students disproportionately debt racism stops ever getting job field. 

Between monetary exploitation, racism, overwhelming debt guarantee even assistance placement afterwards, unis NEED students come back get tuition, send everyone home. sweet deal them. seriously care fucks students because, women minorities, that's business usual. ignorance goes drug discovery, development, regulatory compliance astounding.  Yeah, we've avoided doctor's offices exposure. kids need yearlies, see dentist cleanings going anywhere near places right unless emergency. Q: Since us (and curious) - legal, e.g. asking come gym person; tell written letter (not email) going cancel membership? I've expecting flareups well, protests opening bars such, far things appear stable low level. True. I’ll give ignorance “not us, we’re america@ frankly misplaced faith government well. Thankfully Michigan’s governor Detroit’s mayor handled better most. hindsight always 20/20. Also hospitals starting get overloaded, means less available resources patients, 'sacrifices' made... sounds like USA would do. Better burn mask start making strangers again! Fuck yeah, America! Thanks this. wish people go fatality much. Yes, worst thing happen. hope avoided much possible. let's discuss terrible outcomes survive.

I wonder percentage people get this, ill month come feeling fine without complications. data I'd like see. surprised 5%, too. insensitive issue Black Lives Matter movement compare bars think matters *that* much? think drinking problem bit asshole. wild watch huge numbers people go back normal life mode nothing happened. Huge facepalm. understand that, example common vaccine. believe point still stands. possible vaccine get come guarantee effectiveness even offer full protection. It’s possible it’ll decrease severity infection, would absolutely win.

The point covid 19 need fairly high immunity hit herd immunity. 26% people taking vaccine already really bad position mean mask ineffective Cali 90% covered yet still spiking? Yup early 1900’s dozens college athletes died playing football rule changes criticized effeminate. least live country government gives away money ordeal. Texas, Arizona, Cali, Florida account 30,000 thats 36 states accounting 20,000.

sc, nc, ga, la, tenn, ala usually good another 8k them.

so thats 38,000 10 states. 12,000/40 = 300. good news 20 states posting sub 100 new infections. 

might get week. outbreak worsens considerably states sure. There's way 10x. much testing place right high. probably closer 4-5x new cases. You’re right. People west don’t care families friends. 🙄

Or maybe there’s forces work. K. Yeah, figure there's reason. really know else might had, tbh. pretty much never get flu (although guess theoretically possible), sickest I've since got cholera Mexico almost decade ago.

But yeah, knows. Wow super intelligent thoughtful response. 

OK don’t buy bitcoin, anyone else half brain investigate understand it’s important context probably should. Jobs scarce right now, pretty confident potus continue extra $600. not, basically prepare destruction like never seen US history. Roughly 40 million unemployed jobs there, it’s going bad.  Yeah need better friends, cause one stupid live, seriously. flaming blue fuck friend lived adulthood staggering, like Darwinism failed multiple numerous times dodged bullet level Darwinism. ""I think poison poison, I'm gonna drink it"" level raw blind naked stupidity. Damn right. Fuck Pats, too. GO GIANTS! nation south extremely low bar. comparing Australia- huge land mass, low population etc. impatience, vanity, and/or inability (or learn do) things themselves. there's literally zero reason guy functioning hands pair scissors cant figure give halfway acceptable haircut. 

worst case scenario let grow out, humans millions years even invented haircuts. would require modern people bunch fucking pussies, gonna happen. banned r/conspiracy Yeah, definitely tend optimistic view things. don’t get much is, saw people wearing masks, like, “Okay, we’ve got this!” Obviously much.

Oh keep stuff like hand. I’m running little low. I’m necessarily worried stuff running again, it’s don’t want go cases continue rise exponentially. I’m teacher know point, *are* going go in-person instruction. Even mask wearing, don’t want risk going absolutely to. We'll none empathy humanity here. profits generate. Squeal boy plan leave everyone lockdown indefinitely,

So overwhelming health care systems every 3 months collapse together anything appealing? 

For record, I'm favor strict lockdowns myself, everything open trying conduct business usual stupid point. 

There many non-essential businesses open right really business open GLOBAL PANDEMIC!!! Hopefully find help worth hiring..there hiring signs everywhere. Eat rich. Keep mind, based research done virus time. Science research constantly evolves we’ve learning new things virus everyday. Even wrong, going based information given scientists. Ew! *I found one!* Keep coming Right. They’ll definitely go lower offers. Yes read too. sure exactly kids going back year. kids supportive home online work success? absolutely agree school better kids, think schools able successful. Also, must consider adults work schools families children. I'm currently planning taking vaccine, exactly say I'm taking chances corona either. means I'll staying strict quarantine since March. sucks, I'm prepared jump vaccine know little about. I'm hoping upon hopes ""treatment"" emerge. Since people sides spectrum, let's realistic define range dates f\*ed pandemic end. 

**Best case**: vaccine available end 2020 ""cautiously optimistic"" Fauci stated. Assumed manufacturing already underway then, still take least 3 months reach mass production. Thereafter world looking least 12 month global undertaking completely vaccinate 7B people. end date pandemic early 2022. mid-end 2021 international non-essential travel resume. 

**Worst case (more realistic):** vaccine still 6-12 months away. manufacturing handle 1B doses every year. Assuming US outbid rest world try buy damn doses itself, global campaign going take anywhere 24-36 months. Remember small pox took 120 months measles STILL eradicated. also huge risk second waves countries unable vaccinate populations, anti-vaxxers, virus mutations lifetime antibodies re-vaccination required. Texas recently reclosed bars large venues reopen. 

Of course, bar owners strong reopened, knows ther going shake out.

I'm Louisiana, Phase 2 reopening we're going back Phase 1. lot strange frustrating things happening Arizona unfortunately. Somethings got shut they’re enforced there’s still gyms that’s going remain open, mention there’s AZ councilman leading protesters wearing masks, knows what’s next. said, think people wear masks. I'm merely saying let conversation devolve masks versus masks. Social distancing staying home important thing. NYC here. April really bad. Refrigerated trucks outside funeral homes... now, I’d say it’s 50/50 people wearing masks outside. Shameful. Stay safe good luck yours. listen anything says? Read say mid-February. busy trying warn family, guy telling everyone concerned. danger virus US ""just minuscule"". He's total fraud. Brevard county big tourism area. I'm wondering that's factor close friend mine also nurse said same. They're starting employees come symptoms tested ordered quarantine home too. gonna mess. coworkers working covid patients MONTHS tested EVER. least hospital they're testing employees unless they're showing symptoms. imagine disastrous may end up... LeTs bLaMe jOe RoGaN stop concerts people might listen music realize country music sucks cock. feb &amp; recent antibody testoneblood gave antibody test resultscoming back negative 48hrs donating blood &amp; hear red cross similar. Im palm beach county florida pretty ball testing one hotspots exhausted attempting educate around me. opening early. look US right mainly states opened earlier like Texas, Florida, Georgia etc seeing spike cases. states like NY NJ hotspots back April/May still control seen spike cases again. countries never rushed reopening like US states. Also helps countries unified approach dealing it. US state pretty much ended thing. US unified approach rush reopening soon probably situation right now. current test positive rate, probably closer 200k infections per day right now. still probably far back April hardly testing finding 30k day average. one villainizing them. They're still welcome return, - whichever feel better themselves. ()):::::::::::::::::::::D~~~~~~~Fuck You! proud! impressed totally disappointed TX right now... survival water transportation device know even proven vaccine yet? friend police officer Germany. keeps reminding saying German translates : “The dumb die first”. Let’s praise Belgium much Normal unemployment month $600 less bring home 2 weeks. wouldn’t survive. Still looking Wuhan's lab. obviously nature made. one seems care. Questions need asked, accident? purpose? winners coming this? creepy asterisks, instead inserting meme? You’re welcome! Spread word. Destroy misinformation please wear mask... Omg someone thinks like me. Trump racist bush allowed 9/11 happen lied WMD Iraq invaded it. bush dangerous Trump. Kinda like shooting. one couple days ago Walmart California. Media really mention it, like even news worthy  Uhm, don’t. 1,405 according DSHS. Goodnight bud, likewise. Maricopa County 3,414 new cases today (from 15,547 tests). resident *very* small town Iowa, one first 3 cases, confirm totally true. Everyone laughed March wife wearing facemasks, son developed pneumothorax lungs birth, still breathing problems almost year later. everyone freaking fuck ""someone know it."" whole situation blowing mind. oxford's vaccine poses best chance one coming soon modified MERS vaccine making Well one told so... risky? one saying that. Less risky perhaps. Useless now: antibodies would gone it. doesn’t specifically sound like covid suppose it’s possible almost feel like would effective saying F it, going scorched earth media tour, currently, likely banging head wall trying get president comprehend longer tweet length discussions. people selfish stupid. like realize control things would open up. distance wore masks would see sports come back, movies open up, etc. blacklist US, might lower thier list gets first sure they'd offer it. bigger question whether States would accept ""kung vaccine"" danger RNA vaccines? states (Arizona) literally reported zero deaths. actually think truly one died, issues reporting? Texas, Florida, California days barely report deaths shoot following days.

We'll see week next week goes.

Florida also actively hiding deaths. 5x increase pneumonia deaths spring compared yearly average... suspicious pandemic primarily kills people via pneumonia, huh?

We also know glut (a massive supply) ventilators right now. would surprised one bit find keeping people ventilators well past expiration, delay inevitable, hope best.

The coming weeks telling though, see uptick deaths miraculous ways, explanations (younger population getting it, better treatments, increased targeted testing find active cases previously), we'll wait see goes coming days/weeks.

I'm cautiously optimistic though. certainly may surpass previous death counts per day.. think expect inevitable uptick too... Houston this? know never step foot buy superior public health efforts.

Italy Spain's public health sure helped something. ignorance. callousness, yes. Don’t worry, MA, south coming you. Houston, problem. magical moving money going come from? Oh wait, I'll go shake money tree back yard. give enough deposits + rent + $$$$$ cost fucking move. Name one killing people mentally physically. ACT problem AIDS epidemic solution wasn’t electoral politics, direct action. political change matter voting. feel I'm worst state south. ready lockdown months get late summer fun. Now, look like anywhere close controlling next year. 

So frustrating able go anywhere anything I've locking down, wearing mask go washing hands frequently help combat ended happening anyways. 

All friends feel do. lucky friends acquaintances educate pro-mask/anti-covid. shame suffer consequences others actions. Wait what?! delivery now? It’s true am. Filthy swine trying find facts, dare Holy cow. discussing thing ( much less eloquently) facebook works well know exactly trump fans. all. can't ask person he/she participated protests. scream ""racist"", death threat sue you. 600 top normal unemployment. $600 ends, still get normal unemployment go work. Or, go work one hotels still spite empty going bankrupt. Yup stop Mueller investigating crimes committed .makes perfect sense. Good him, protest work time mouse. Jk jk. Definitely good news.

Edit: Forgot sub in.  one states, frustrating. acted differently since GA reopened, know I'm minority. I've working home, venturing (with mask on) 1x week groceries since mid March.

I'm gonna keep part, infuriating dumbass governor (who voted against, counted) can't get shit together. Many businesses still trying, many people not. Like MIL, thinks made make trump look bad even though tested positive, allowed hospital see dying (not covid) father. probably case, covid infectious herd immunity needs something like 60-80% population &amp; basically possible chance *-that-* much higher. still? protest/date 1000 people wearing masks? I’d love see pictures. Amazing 75% Raleigh much less 50% areas I’ve seen. I'm okay BLM protesters getting families sick. must missed memo disproportionately affecting black people. guess black lives matter much all. panelists mention things like trust government public figures, don’t mention one think bearing (at least America possibly west general.). People place great emphasis looking others face. inherently distrust people whose faces covered. Culturally, believe it’s polite deal openly, honestly, face face. Everyone wearing mask kind cultural anathema us. meningococcal

What percentage population actually goes something like that?

I'm antivaxx slightest probably really pay attention program like that, guess bc I'm concerned catching it. Unless like local epidemic? USA prisoners China so... US Looking ahead. would seem need medical attention rather alcohol. Incorrect. Honestly thought process college cold mild sickness. yes, opening colleges terrible idea. Death panels. Implemented republicans, ACA. that's wild, sister canceled end july wedding months ago .. family traveling across states, seem right.

A lot people sub don’t want good news refuse acknowledge slur use then? Sure strays wheelhouse often seemingly without realizing it. Pleased meet you, hope guess name. Florida motherfucking benchmark global stupidity ignorance. Let stupid ones die, shame collateral damage cause. act like isnt full blown fucking pandemic ravaging US. Jesus swear motherfuckers don’t brain cell firing. point using football players pawns don’t get paid wrong. don’t play lose scholarship. play chance ending career due said fucking pandemic. NBA union collectively decided play, maybe. every pro sport. Hell colleges won’t even campus come fall. want kids go play football enjoyment? GTFO bullshit. people really think pandemic “over” lockdowns lift. need lower expectations people I’ll stop pissed stuff. We’ve become benchmark failure. “what do” country.  Gosh scandal. No, sorry. I’m doubting happened, mean recently. got money last stimulus bill that. inland empire going get wrecked. 796 positive 3000 tests Tuesday (couldn’t find exact number tests) San Bernardino county. think talking closing “bars” I’ve asked many people question constitution. one answer. know france24 speaking assume outbreak Campania.

Some bulgarian workers tested positive. contact tracing started cases discovered. lockdown imposed area (a set buildings) 4 left answer phone calls. citizens got crazy started yelling quarantined workers. One bulgarian worker throws chair towards citizens, citizens respond stones vandalizing workers cars. situation escalated police called army controlling quarantined area.

Then politician shows city support citizens people another political party protest guy using bulgarian workers example promote anti immigration views.

That's less.

The outbreak ongoing Campania (5.8 millions) 64 cases linked far bulgarian workers, 23 discovered yesterday.

Since yesterday 140 cases whole country think say lockdown referring italy general. Sorry mate can't edit titles provide body context Holy crap, that’s gonna make lot money B much wanna bet insurance won’t cover that. Congratulations beating odds. know death bit lagging indicator, TX still around 35ish deaths day? praise us NY/MA basically amount deaths per day? source saying 92-95% needed oh mean one easy. Money.

NY, *thankful* sister foresight postpone July wedding back March .. would likely canceled anyway def less stressful sooner handle it. Enjoy dollars Yeah, mask wearing needs step up. Lots people still shopping wearing masks distancing. I'm Toronto area we've fair share spikes lately Ontario cases largely migrant workers farms localized. But, everyone stay vigilant. test positive confirmation reinfected? back March, recovered, June. Deaths seem dropping cliff Sweden, really quite incredible. Perhaps really kind immunity community unaware of. I've huge critic people saying that, start wonder. Hear constantly well. Oh ""if wearing mask wear one"". coffee.  go-to funeral last week, wife people wearing masks.

We got shunned, like bad guys Americans:

*heavy breathing* 100% always heard South would rise again.


And many beach counties orange red? promised internet medical professionals Faux News Flu deniers sun, breeze, surf, sand cure something believe anyway. I'd perfectly fine quarterly vaccinations meant bringing insanity end quicker. confirm, Louisiana. average Joe special kind stupid.

Btw happy cake day increase revenue. Can’t places like Amazon paying taxes. CDC isn’t credible? 125,000+ deaths (just US) little two months isn’t credible?

Where find information actually choose believe? constitutes “credible” aren’t willing even listen CDC deadly virus? isn’t meant aggressive question, it’s genuine inquiry. goddamn bots early country likely herd immunity reasonable amount time?

All small cost hundred thousand lifes. Lol. Halo predicted this. He's steadily transitioning Tony Stark Wilson Fisk past several years seems. Cries Dutch. ""Reason ought slave passions"" government offices closed... Wrong. creating false impression reader's mind stating something factual wrong. thousands examples this, media politicians day long. I'm sorry bro fail understand :) hubris America downfall. agree disagree. realized March. ever indian wedding? wild docile. even grandma electric bugaloo Oh without doubt. coworkers refuse wear masks outside work. sadly alternate universe, much wish were. Places like level foreign culturally, much part country (although Europe they'd several countries me) caption one:

\*Only look excess deaths $3,100 per dose ""Sorry, Karen, condition means get stay home."" Stoopid hick consider nothing various approach? Everything fine dandy infections control nobody seems care. need shut down. willingly keep infecting people portion population ignorant wear masks. Institute fines Jesus Christ stop making recommendations. Peoples lives stake afraid tel people wear mask? 1000 dollar fines police don’t want enforce find somebody will. absolutely paying attention “guidelines” bars restaurants wouldn’t open. buffets open San Bernardino county health department doesn’t even know. hit 796 cases one day. around 3000 day. suggest do? keep let going? guess fashionistas wrong, synthetics breath better cotton. Basically like Flood Infection Form tentacles Halo, except microscopic scale. agree you, there’s lot echo chamber hate going around sub. Shhh. know better. They’re showing us tough are. Everything big Texas, even stupid. Let’s quietly watch play out. Where'd get *your* degree virology? Trump University? bad guy. never started Tesla forced actual creator sign document never talk it. hired spies go around ruin people’s lives whistleblowers company. lied Las Vegas building underground transit system them. list goes said like NY global medical people share valuable info gathered along way better treat patients thus helping reduce death rate. hear ""If scared stay home. going back normal whether like not.""

So basically, care. attempt shaming fail. touche. recognize push masks initially, sit well. said elsewhere, believe many sensitive begin with. [Reminds little appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* also nurses.

Back March, nurse know contemplating buying cruse tickets good deals were.

She's spent every day traveling like crazy. Cottage rentals. Vacation getaways nurses. believe every big bank bailed this. forcing citizens 

Here go freedom talk again. problem country. ""pretty sure"" masks help, 100% positive scientific proof. 

You want know mandates wear masks? CDC ""suggests"" it, people take ""well to, suggested."" mandated ""muh civil liberties."" lose/lose people like you. 

Sure, one going force wear mask even mandated. free wear one wear one, WANT wear one protect fellow citizens? Oh maybe know something don't. working ICU? sure know ""imminent"" means? 

I'm downplaying virus saying going happen, I'm clarifying happening now. states given guidelines ahead time, last minute.

It even really happen New York, although really bad days long lines ER likely drove death rate. Italy literally ran oxygen ventilators, ambulances came, people died home. happening right AZ. course did. stupid, students expected better them? ? Before. I’m thinking it’ll probably state state.

Edit: state office workers know also asked back office. Source? data man? think helmets protect crash. evidence? would agree. That's implicit bias showing. maybe ask instead, come there’s certain cities better healthcare US? come there’s certain states better healthcare? come there’s countries better healthcare? expected uproot entire lives? come US doesn’t fix healthcare problem? come there’s travel ban US citizens covid? come death rate high countries they’ve fallen? countries don’t? healthcare systems work? differ ours? what’s answer? Hospitals aren’t businesses though... commissioner said players don’t want play count breach contract. every right play lose money he’s still deciding play. Yeah guy getting CONSPIRACY entire medical community descedit ""leadership"" president Donald Trump. smh Quick, expand executive order include counties. way hospitals claim available ICU capacity order continue elective procedures, continue pretend problem. so, used tax dollars buy this, yes? they're going sell back us letting us get sick. That's cool. thanks government. youre always looking me. Ducey (Arizona's governor) *finally* re-closed bars gyms last night. people think kind liberal ploy take away rights. wrap conspiracy theory videos rants allow believe isn’t real. 

Then two weeks later Facebook pages begging hopes prayers someone love tested positive. people refuse believe stove hot touch themselves.  apply analogy closely, would be: ""Mommy, look, ocean going away!"" ""Yes! Look new real estate! Let's immediately build high-density residential units here!"" mmk master builder Like said don’t think he’s evil - think he’s likely narcissist /ruthless businessman thinks knows what’s best everyone - likely thinks good harm believes people thought best world would better - unfortunately that’s flawed mindset - wanting good good diff things - road hell paved w good intentions Air craft carrier potentially military base. people beaches wearing masks, social-distancing, less keeping moving? things like playing beach sports, going boardwalk bars, mingling extended periods place, touching shower bathroom door handles railings? take health care system granted Canada - still far perfect. cancellation 'non-essential' surgeries lead Jerry's Death.

I still favor Canada's lock measures - discussion needs had, Canadians need aware implications. doubtful, think even limit. probably wait last minute all. Lol! prefer Reddit. Right. something breaks. notice name brands give lifetime warranties brands dont.

Then get either spend double replacing spend shipping.

Thats personal experiences talking. know others far luckier me. mayor understand exponential growth? actually graduate high school?  know guy supposed expert, gut tells full shit certain level. People (obviously) act fellow ""man""'s interests unless forced. pandemic sure exposed major problems society. likely problems already existed, covid brought extreme light. Yes. source I’m using, sounds like you’re neglecting set display information per 100k.

That’s probably mistake much US population making! arbitrary capricious basis science.

Dunno, arizona texas enough evidence need bear trap rigged around dick snap shut people realize rig bear traps around dicks? almost disturbing governor's alternate reality Looking places like Brazil also bad outbreaks seems like something happened May death numbers flattened out

It's treatment improved significantly since March [quoting doctor]. happens state level federal level. California get bombarded it. people wear masks. goodness yes. CA trying put people economy (at least governor been). million? gonna take like 10x that, least, ""taking seriously"" low 90's. California's right precipice. LA County already putting breaks reopening plans. mean loans they’ll pay back? paycheck protection grants (which partially turned loans last minute) could keep everyone employed summer? take look numbers Florida older populations.  may younger generations may make bulk new cases, every single age group right experiencing exponential growth, including older populations. That's dangerous situation in.  doesn’t prevent getting totally protection getting bad? Like flu shot? Hey Angela, know difference N-95 mask regular face mask?

If yes, I'm sure agree right doctors special PPE reserved use. 

If no, I'd recommend Googling difference. 

You're right: Fauci say wear masks. However, feel like missing context said it. 

I think right tell people need specific grade mask stop panic-buying them. not. live Texas, know stupid. nothing try optimistic face ugly reality. I’m part. I’m 50 &amp; vulnerable, I’m staying home. Even though state Phase 4 reopening, still go pickup contact grocery orders, dog food &amp; doctors appointments. working home. son left job March, recently started new place &amp; self isolates home. daughter vulnerable &amp; sees boyfriend &amp; parents besides us.

I’m angry people spreading infection don’t want forced stay home year longer, depending long takes people realize make half-assed effort get control. Wear mask, social distance &amp; wash/sanitize damned hands &amp; STAY HOME can’t things! wear mask protect others, can’t everyone else wear one protect vulnerable? Please tell tattoo Tegnell yours.  Exactly. fair, phone n much information Facebook more. laughing, pulling hair screaming weeping horror Americans inflicting themselves.

p.s. live Toronto every day run dozens fuckheads wear mask think joke Chinese conspiracy little flu wear mask chin That's assuming USA testing much ""No way prevent this"" says nation single largest virus outbreak worldwide pandemic countries seem handling things well Why

Because they're stupid. [be careful! 

Not sure accurate make fair points fitness home cheap make cheap. paid fortune everything person needs fitness. tastes guess, need top line barbells, example. need top line stuff - bare skin comes name brand stuff, etc. need it. thinks protestith much ... Try ya prick. reason suggested subreddit, far ahead terms info info posted here, info posted weeks behind.what stated already know subreddit tear Can’t ever flip-flop like sissy. ratio detected undetected cases also moving well. Whilst virus still seeing high days case counts, deaths arent high. Theres number factors account one simply testing conducted compared March example. Hopkins also use UTC/GMT counts? Cool - good you. Information workers internalize wfh new normal. Except well resourced kids (rich parents take time ability teach kids, computers internet, etc) aren’t going fall behind way. 

Very true. harder kids others sure. Kids forget learn focus lose interest learning focusing. 

source? Kids wired learning focus learn constantly even outside school. highly adaptable resilient. Interest learning problem good teacher. People naturally curious desire learn explore. it’s college ready likely issue, it’s kids struggle get high school get college fail don’t appropriate math (and other) skills.

On plus side, pushing back year could give extra time study get accepted. Even ones move college could benefit depending long takes us get virus control still doubt everyone need held back. I'm person work knows someone got released hospital still skeptical think problem many refuse wear masks 100% make decisions choosing sit out. won’t get paid. I'm glad years ago. least know racist personally.on Reddit basically 2,400 base could it? Shit - could give people free N95s still wouldn’t wear em. Looking back, make big deal 9/11? people die flu every year. know single person died day. really Saudi Arabia's fault...

/s one wants breathe Covid-filled nose farts, Tony! even banned spouses entering. separating legal immigrants too. Funny enough ban well received Reddit. Fauci fear monger  establish direction one data point lmao Exactly. build point, reason able respond pandemic well (multiple treatments, dozen promising vaccine candidates) robust pharmaceutical industry. 

Hundreds labs, thousands well-educated experienced researchers professionals - infrastructure powered massive capital investment industry. Anyone claim it’s wasteful, unless want make every pharma employee lab government asset (and pay it), rely industry fight pandemics today tomorrow. Calling Idiocracy insult idiocracy. Yikes. dangerous conclusion. single death tragedy, 100,000 statistic. right thing. Hang there. rather ignore medical advice risk killing people. Pretty sure Trump voted president brought decline open. yeah, almost humiliating that, also unfortunate? 14% positive tests disturbingly high number keeps growing. Trump (admittedly fantasy Trump) come April saying “we’re together, let’s protect other, let’s wear masks public” proceed wear mask himself, don’t think you’d see bullshit see today, might even way mess.

I mean, take look much better east Asia, southeast Asia, Europe doing. wearing mask middle pandemic insane. think overestimating intelligence average person. get corporations speaking like might actually see change views wearing masks. Corporations control GOP bosses tell them. Cruise ships unsafe precisely inherent features cruise ships: circulated air every room, small number doorknobs objects used hundreds people day, instance.

An outdoor protest vast majority attendees wearing mask (for part, obviously every moment) trying keep safe distance entirely different matter.

Both incur risks, yeah, they're completely different magnitudes risk, that's even touch utilitarian calculus matter, one cause behind pure self-indulgence.

And yeah, turns wearing mask, social distancing, restricting social activity outdoors effective thousands people less risky going bar. town totally isolated rest country? point one allowed out?

If not, yes. school remain closed. think would safe open? picture Putin Trump? Lol dont want live planet anymore.....

::::climbs spaceship....doesnt start:::

SHIT! Sadly think many think Fauci exaggerating there’s real pandemic. Hoax! So? Point lockdowns economic consequences, whether money printed. Distributing money well good keep people fed housed, objection that, still shortage *useful work*. Students within given course mix, students courses (excluding know personally outside training least). instructors different courses may mix degree since command may sync things like course dates. compare. roughly density Queens. Go ahead compare two areas US drug companies took DeLorean back 1922 spent billions Canadian development, need charge 10 times much country present day Half-assed? like stuck heads ground tried pretend exist. No-assed it. estimate fairly specific US rounded nice number. Really could like 7 times 13 times dont truly know sure. 90 positive COVID-19 cases among 110 individuals. 82 90 cases students, rest cadre people support administration still say fault. blame new administration deaths. One those... both. Black, White, Polka dot human beings one thing common blasted Covid 19 virus. sad many see way. middle global pandemic last thing need stirring race issue. mean somehow tragedies ignored? No, can't respond ways put others danger. 

I see got downvoted seen anyone contribute discussion sharing disagreed say. clearly meant malice whatsoever absolutely correct. Thanks boldness speak something even unpopular view. Less 5% global population

More 25% deaths

God bless America earlier points, longer go pandemic people affected it. would think even dumbest people begin take seriously finally end losing close loved one them. way continue full force till vaccine gets without shutdowns every couple months proper usage PPE. I'm hoping people wise soon right, people still flood places reopenings sustainable people putting safety measures. allowing corporations keep building buildings allowing metropolitan cities emerge isnt ignorant callous? entire planet could benefit greatly actually listening george carlin. build huge city, enough hospital capacity 5000 people city 2 million residents. piss moan saving who. God help us if, would intriguing see, blame would lay another country nuked us. Bold question ask article written woman named Christianna Silva. LOL. source, news article. Per article, CDC gives upper bound 35% asymptomatic carriers. Fauci's upper bound 50%. precisely making mask that's true. Take highly rated hand-towel example, particular useless get hand-towels vary widely.  

Where I'd like see go though eventual making cloth reusable N90 (pick designation) mask. Maybe 90% steep challenge put standards let manufacturers make them. make buy better nothing total crap shoot. years back, Facebook deleted 2B fake accounts. amount real accounts. assume big social media mediums similar ratio. scary easily internet herded sheep longer believe science.

In case folks get memo: ""cool"" ""smart"" device/app factor determining smart engineer/developer is.....Not you!!! TIL ‘Murican guilt thing.

You’re assholes... it’s shockingly high percentage lawmakers are.

But Canadian speaking myself, still love guys :) come join us /r/coronavirusAZ. bunch info like posted every day summary post. No, get race ethnicity different things. Or, least may good reasons treat differently.

My question there's variety? Asians? Native Americans? numerous categories? Obviously diversity opinion exists every group, do. disagree take it’s “bullshit.” Yes, severe POTS. It’s hell completely disabled me. Tachycardia, passing out, poor

Casinos california allowed open.

You might confused thinking indian casinos sovereign territory part california. asked trackers? 300 million people vaccinated we'll close herd immunity United States postponed flights dozens American diplomats planned return China later month, failing reach agreement Beijing issues including COVID-19 testing quarantine. 

In words, China demanding full standard 14-day isolation quarantine full Chinese control; however, US wants China waive requirement. China sticking guns telling US go fuck think getting without 14-day spokesperson China’s Ministry Foreign Affairs said close communication regarding return U.S. diplomats “The virus still spreading overseas China continues fair amount pressure prevent import cases overseas,” spokesperson said fax response Reuters’ “The epidemic control measures diplomatic corps China applied equally across board. China strives preserve hard-won achievement countering virus together diplomatic corps, provide good conditions good living environment everyone work live China.” 

Meanwhile, US spewing Diplomats say agreeing tested contravenes 1961 Vienna Convention Diplomatic Relations. internal State Department guideline dated June 17 says approved plan includes testing Chinese procedures upon arrival, sources familiar matter say agency want waive diplomatic inviolability staff still negotiating Chinese authorities issue. 

The US either agree Chinese quarantine immediately expelled. Several diplomats said concerned potential Chinese authorities take DNA samples possibility parents separated children family members tested “This essentially puts us mercy Chinese government, tensions run extremely high,” U.S. diplomat, speaking condition anonymity, told Reuters preparing return work China. 

And reason tensions high? US that. Play stupid games, win stupid “We situation officers forced decide separated families bringing potentially dangerous situation,” diplomat said. 

Given lack containment US, near eradication China, pretty obvious far dangerous US. Thanks photos Gov Wolf marching protests without mask, lot folks won’t take seriously. But, people already didn’t take seriously. would rather spew hatred bigotry Internet regarding anything Rachel Levine say. Thank you!I never really got help even ELD Mexico till 7 lady tried helping speech school kinda sucked :/ I’ve actually passed classes teachers speak Spanish.There’s tutoring college plan join start work helps I’m always assigned students speak Spanish can’t communicate well students don’t also start speaking clearly supervisors always go boss help (she’s one speaks Spanish) talking stock prices. actually episode Mr. Iglesias covered Latinx. sure drivers behind production, characters pushing on-screen Latinx.

It really bothers (white) someone says things like ""A Latinx woman.."". That's I'm like ""We already word that. Latina!"".

In non-gender-specific contexts still sticks bit feels little weird. attribute mostly newness. guess comment 1% non-political.  I'm goddam worried health care costs going make pandemic harder likely become seriously ill.

And we're paying full price treatments COVID waivers expiring. Evidently tougher developing nuclear weapons sending man moon. mother lives there. Hasn’t left house except dr. groceries months. It’s nuts - keep going like folks pre-existing conditions long-haul lockdown. even guaranteed. can't wait weasel open combat one. local mall packed every day stores aren’t keeping line get get swamped people disturbing Labs expanding capacity, they're taking away states. That’s true though. don’t know tested wait 5 hours line testing centers around capped early afternoon. Testing Sundays closed many locations. You’re misleading people. agree overall sentiment, feelings imo far virologist ""thinks"" neither evidence.

Expert's thinking barely makes hierarchy evidence. Usually metanalysis/systematic review order top, gold standard RCT blindness higher less lower down, followed less controlled trials. various studies already happened humans, animal/petri dish studies case reports order.

Below \*maybe\* could expert opinion, must. expert thinks may may even that. Notable inclusions Orange, Kern, Riverside, San Beranardino can't really manufacture multiple billions doses per year though. need least several year length vaccine. There’s website app.  think there’s factors play though.

One way reduce tests reduce number people looking one. far know go medical professional first recommend test, point go get one. recommendations strict test positivity would go up.

The way reduce tests reduce testing altogether. Reduce locations, reduce number tests administered ina given day, etc. previously providing 50,000 tests day next week reduced count 40,000 positivity would remain similar number positives would go sheer number tests administered would lower. We’ve time hear horror stories people travel multiple testing sites find one open — would fall line reduced number available testing per day, period. State ones (source) us know them. expect could cause it. say wouldn't. expect lots people got sick areas COVID counts.

Why going fucking nuts fact traceable exact protest could caused it

I expect hate BLM want use platform keep it.

**Even examples mix people wearing wearing them**

if go one, acceptable risk.

In Seattle &amp; CHOP, saw tons them! cause found pics videos one, mean anything.

The fact is, time people go packed public places without mask, put risk. remember Alamo!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s hypocritical he’s one posting crippling anxiety checking every article covid reddit. thing moderating news intake, people reddit don’t spend way much time apocalyptic subreddit Yeah that's true. know UI works states mine making general assumption. also realize lot people even received check yet state system backed inefficient. mainly making point extra $600 generous ""a lot"" comments thread insinuated. may true would think asking question would important could actually accurately documented. information better. data show otherwise. One study conclusive data. Especially study relying cell phone data. bought cotton flannel sheets Amazon. cheaper buying yardage, plus fabric store white flannel.

I using combed cotton kind before. wonderful fabric. Sheets make luxurious linings. Much better cheap muslin, hard find anyway. Except better Uber drivers, Uber flooding market part time drivers offering rides loss. next hype hydroxychloroquine? far know, studies published far, including one Dr. Fauci mentioned, shown less shorter average stay hospital remdesivir (11 days instead 15), ZERO change mortality. evidence save lives, $3000 pretty impressive price treatment little.

Don't get wrong, people need ventilators, people need intensive care, people die, AWESOME...but that's remdesivir does. People mild symptoms early stages profit it, people seriously ill barely. So, what's point? miss anything? really helping anyone except Gilead? No, thinking Volga.. might admit political virtuousness make immune disease. Fudging science order favor message bad Trump it. ask, there's spike, amiright? New Hampshire benefiting Massachusetts taking seriously.

I'm worried false sense security going lead disaster here. I'm either opinion. But, lot diseases infect loads people basically nothing daily basis. vaccines treatment could bring Corona go back normal like every disease bad coroan? saying think need eradication go back normal. certainly can't go back normal now, vaccines might able to. Even dont completely eradicate Fuck this. kid allowed around neighborhood friends kids since Valentine's day. He's four. little neighborhood friends playing together street, parents socializing outdoor front yard BBQ parties, walking bus parents get free food, etc. one social distancing wearing mask. tell kids can't play come kid bike street. want family sick. one knows effect get it. I'm taking chances. family way precious. bought masks social distancing paraphernalia instead seen tear gassing, macing, pepper spray videos? telling ppl kept mask cough everywhere ppl rush assist other? Boy videos you. wonder demographic ppl hospital? Funny right leaning crowd sudden became party young. I'm left hypocrisy party embarrassing. even talking about? conspiracy theory contact tracers track protests. 

[Mayor NYC explicitly says contact tracers ask people attended unique NYC either.

If contact trace protests, obviously going find protests spread virus... explicitly reject data. Well one right vaccine know ingredients mass produce sad thing people forgot many stories (in Wuhan, Italy, NY) people driving one hospital another another. People died getting rejected crowded waiting rooms. Houston 102% capacity right now....

Here CA I'm hearing imperial county xfers filling Riverside county hospitals. happens next 2-3 weeks scares me. Really? wonder is. “adequate” sun exposure correct amount then? Obviously POC require sunlight shouldn’t follow guidelines fair skinned person. production problem? idea. Someone? I’m reading right ministry? They’re notorious absolutely screwing anyone everyone it’s benefit. 

I’d highly advise anyone working these, *especially* missions church planting, keep safety net maintained. I’ve seen fuckers literally toss people street twenty years more. like give vehicle, phone, house etc keep pressured stay give boot means person often loses everything without notice. 

Terrible people target good intentions. It’s way common field. crispy. could possibly safer?

This insanity. point trying make here? coming rust belt next. Friends say completely different scene, get plane, people airport masks nobody does. show pictures kids packing bars news, riles over-50 crowd watches news picture retirees packing restaurant somewhere. I've ridiculously hard time finding tofu. like pandemic turned everyone vegetarian/vegan meat short supply. look counties compared population, people would drive quite distance eat indoors vs getting takeout near home. Cross county trips pretty minor. Arent important? 100 people attending wedding get covid important? Huh? Death toll isnt fear mongering ? say need know new infections, well story telling us 100 new infections!!! Username checks scared public restrooms maybe less. slow walking back strict stay home orders Join us /r/collapse understand upset, [sorry hear expected What's hard finger. Fucking want end soon, soon. Weird one co-worker ""white"" SA considered Hispanic here. Brazil Peru worse.  Except eyes countries.

In global pandemic, good look greedy cunt. That's fucking awful. I'm sorry. many part time unnecessary positions begin with? one *real* job effected. literally know *no one* sit home get paid it. basically going keep adding ""beds"" know can't staff. technically beds available stop elective surgeries about. SMH. Sturgill Simpson deserves exposure recognition Country music, frat boy country-bro's like Chase Rice stupid shit like put full concerts pandemic get noise today. sad see. I'm millennial complete social isolation since even recommended public health officials.

However, Instagram feed flooded fellow millennials partying masks on, hugging other, rushing gyms/bars/restaurants soon opened, etc. friends still seek casual sex. 

No one social circle takes virus seriously, except older people know. Don’t mean “documentary” directed America’s first time traveler?????? Fast food workers need union workers always get shittied Let’s go!!!! they’re likely get severely sick, still lasting effects young people. may hospitalized, lung issues stemming weeks isn’t uncommon.

Isolated housing people ages, yes, also figure dorms fucking packed. think meningitis outbreaks- occur, run absolutely rampant, given many students packed top one another. Coronavirus would different, severity less likely level, it’s also gamble you’d want take. also consider students higher risk- it’s like young people don’t asthma, diabetes, obesity... many young people often undiagnosed, assuming haven’t severe issues yet.

I get you’re coming from, also think mindset part problem. outbreak occurs school, there’s still high chance number students die. Young people safer, doesn’t make safe. mention professors staff- often don’t option stay home, assuming want get paid. Plus, large number students still live home- it’s generally freshman (and sophomores sometimes) stay dorms. Many older students may opt apartment, though given current economic climate, that’s less likely right now, large number students may living family, many may high risk.

In schools, already take semester long breaks without much issue health concerns things like that. already ways postpone scholarships financial aid without losing them, even college tries fight it, ways around it.

It’s really tough decision, I’m certain would struggled too, still school. also don’t think students understand actual risks either. think trained pilots important difference safety commercial flights less safe private flights pure regulation. Pilots still get drunk flights, join mile high club, caught snoozing. wish they'd stop reporting immunity, tbh. people gonna use excuse continue go wear masks. shop day

is lot easier said done live food desert, area isn’t safe walk (no sidewalks/street lights, example)

Why dead set recognizing structural barriers place keep people eating ideal diet? misunderstanding partially 3 vaccine delivery platforms used. Two well tested given new payloads.

However, one completely new delivery method never tested before. one probably deserves extra caution (it makes cells generate antigens train immune system). question is, enough? seems like strict lockdown really way get control. Los Angeles 19 counties. got $11 back car insurance company. absolutely *is* both, issue type nuance type political discussion, let alone scientific, lost milisecond major TV news agencies want cover it. no, ""One doctor"" frank, one agency. CNN, MSNBC, CBS, Fox, etc covering angle youth's fault going bars getting hammered ignoring failure entire government structure properly enact shutdown, moreover many youths also working shit jobs shit pay prevents staying home, topped masks used political line sand many boomers refuse wear masks assumption attacking freedoms prior news agencies spout. never see news anchor air state bar workers getting sick, meat factory workers, working shit pay forced dangerous pandemic solely rich's benefit, god damn let people drone youth ones super spreading virus ignoring critical thought government handling virus.

It actual topic false, scapegoat actually avoid taking responsibility admitting fault lies pretty much entirely US set economically domestic level. Instead actually flat admitting largely partisan politics rabid ramblings insane President preventing proper lockdown key, major Covid hotspots using fact Fauci flat points lot youth actually properly practicing safety protocols excuse create yet another boogeyman current Millennial one they've getting use since 08.

The reality both, brushed rug. Young people care themselves, fostered attitude can't really upset it... Yes continent USA. guess prime case pot calling kettle black hope Northeast extend quarantine delay re-openings, turn complete shit show second round meltdowns happening states, remain cautious. hidden one knows. go [Florida click three lines = upper right click map download definitions PDF. [Direct link lower right website part definition, caution. know P-CS.

Given fever, actually indicates ongoing infection.

In COVID-19 patients, sometimes see resurgent infections especially previously mild asymptomatic cases hospital.

Someone tests positive otherwise ""fine."" stroke, heart attack, lungs fill blood, etc.

This happening even cases we're aware of. problem mild patients receiving ongoing follow doctors. hard time collecting outcomes. Ya gotta use acronyms get around AutoMod... POTUS, GOP, DNC, MIC, etc. Guess US Surgeon General also piece crap. bet you, random internet stranger know better order requires mask wearing indoors public generally invited, including workplaces, order states.  mask-wearing order essential stopping recent increase COVID-19 cases seen Pennsylvania,” Gov. Tom Wolf said. “Those hot spots traced situations Pennsylvanians wearing masks practicing social distancing – two practices must adhered want maintain freedoms place reopening.”  order followed Allegheny County setting another record-high number new COVID-19 cases one day Wednesday rise partly blamed young adults crowding bars, well travel.  county's health department announced 110 new cases virus, surpassing Tuesday's record-setting increase one patient disease.  cases continue assigned case investigators gather information individuals contact tracing begin,"" department stated news release.  County's cases also continued climb Wednesday 11 new cases, taking total 230. Greene County remained 41 cases since counting began March. /s ... sadly, right? think surprised quickly people go back dining indoor open. Yeah, he'll continue believe needs emergency medical care hospital turns away beds, hallways, two tents parking lot already overfilled COVID patients.

Then survival fittest, lottery. put dick hole!! think masks made huge difference- I’m amazed little protest spread seen far. agree protests affect- far it’s small effect almost negligible considering cause. said- unspoken affect encouraging regular people stop isolating may bigger affect transmission although never proven Handlers. changed twitter podcast crew subtle marketing backlash. wage disparity separate argument logistics permanent lockdown. damn near half country point.

Nah. seems way loudness, numbers. Frederick Douglass great things working AIDS vaccine Although may true, also several important reasons death rates high: 

1.	Deaths still come, people need get disease first die it. may take 2-3 weeks. 
2.	It’s mainly younger people going getting infected, low death rate.
3.	We gotten better treating Covid anticoagulants, dexamethasone etc.
4.	ICU’s still capacity, doctors don’t choose patients get treated ICU. NY places health care system got overloaded, leading deaths. words Trump making buddies Gilead richer (and probably buying all). feel 76% increase 7 day average 10 days sharp, know say.

Arizona shut back down. gyms, bars, night clubs, water parks. state mask mandate either. done local level. Lobby Congress legitimate access third party? fuck even babbling about? 

You scream Hillary argue change want, however nothing ""people lobbying"". many parties want America. GOP Dems powerful american media polarized never happen. lobbying Congress change it. go on, tell bloated overly complicated government system easily changed citizens have, realistically, power so. Go on. Babble it. Go on. know takes two weeks infections take see death spike. 

For anyone saying ""this wave different"", stop prematurely celebrating.

I genuinely hope I'm wrong two weeks time bad looks like it'll be. correct x 100. started disastrous shit show known NY. making thing, although now, many places spread across country. wish way report people coming cape following bakers 14 day quarantine law pushed through...these people better fuck hard work. wow asshole tho. state stance, educate others go, damn Head CDC Vin Diesel words, patient, would Corona-infected nurses wiping ass. Mm yes, high standard. One would think infected healthcare workers would high standards, Snoogin.

See, good example shortcomings reading comprehension - think writing actually match actually writing. hope state Alabama this...sigh could ever guessed would happen! /S We've past couple weeks honestly, getting pretty concerning seems going up. Wow.. Thanks mercy. Believe not, majority us complete idiots Ah yes, old ""it them"" position. Answer questions previous post. else besides cast 1 vote? methods influence election. go ahead point fingers ""those people"" remain high horse. people's fault, ours. know going restaurant may kill another person. That's it. Crispy rice soju worth someone's life.

Edit: ever worked kitchen, know restaurants magic. cooks sweaty, constantly smoking sometimes bleeding. sometimes cooks dishes too... online classes pretty shitty lot students too- unless professor tech savvy, experience online teaching, class tends pretty rough. least that’s friends still university say.

I get want class campus, paying fuck ton money receive almost education would horrific.

Honestly, better situation would take year off. :/ Speaking stigma, wish red arm band people testing positive. could whenever went shopping (kinda like someone cane: people instinctively create space around him/her.) theory.. hopefully, late teens early 20s, one's formative years becoming adult.

In reality... LOTS people take '*Personal Responsibility*' even they're adults seniors.

You see past weeks months media. I'm sad beer now. could go beer popcorn movie night! Maybe will... decade ago, thought swine flu killed 4,000 Americans. turns actually like 12,000. little less decade that, thought SARS 2% chance death. crunched numbers, around 10%.

We know while. I'm American agree, unfortunately. I'm decked PPE every day since December. mind it, half wear mandatory. I'll look crazy others now, ain't bringing shit home. work airport, ain't fucking stupid. also want get anyone else sick, I'm best selfish stupid asshole. already gave information. simply ignoring want believe it. I'm sorry goes want believe. lead water, can't make drink. BTW, NY horrible testing place back then, getting 50% positive testing rates. accurate picture timing rise cases. ultimate lagging indicator, especially Covid-19. takes several weeks diagnosis patient takes time, sometimes weeks, doctors fill death certificates health officials adjudicate deaths. finally added official state important note take several weeks death records submitted National Center Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, tabulated. Therefore, data shown page may incomplete, likely include deaths occurred given time period, especially recent time periods. Death counts earlier weeks continually revised may increase decrease new updated death certificate data received states NCHS. Yeah gather, never police stopping asking reason outside, fined jailed reason hold scrutiny. That's Italy, worked... cause even idiots forced stay home. spent two months home paid workers undocumented get unemployment benefits thus easy convince come back work.  surprised threatened ICE well. That’s peak 70s/80’s kid threat right there. I’m sure I’m one heard parent say that. lol People simply don’t want live like that. left facebook stuff well. take another post suggesting wear masks eventual path herding us onto concentration camp trains. 

I wonder much content originates groups backed Russian government. mean saw could 2016 election jump opportunity. 

I got point ashamed even platform people, sad lot family members. read it. call skeptic, anything written even good intentions problem, self serving. need validation? stamp it? billion articles doesn’t provide anything new value somehow sort personal relationship company. 

It’s message, it’s source: for-profit company sells air purifiers. It’s needed anywhere matter least comes high quality information. 

It’s like BLM banners plastered company pages. get it. maybe truly believe support cause. I, myself, discount since vested interest financially right sides issue. 

I don’t need feel validated company product aligns thinking. Money. personal belief pandemic shut businesses spite

No, got wrong.

This belief system, like choosing Jesus Buddha. Scientific facts leave room beliefs feelings. ride subway 2-3 times week work probably gotten least 4 different lines last month. majority people keep masks noses mouths I've seen, unlucky lol. I'm essential worker state subway WAY better couple months ago. 

I actually agree stores far worst terms compliance, especially checkout lines. Shoutout lady disregarded distance markers ground stood even behind me, NEXT (??????) day, unmasked kid running around store. anyone know good video interviews footage people Covid-19?

A lot friends family care virus anymore - think flu/a cough goes away. they're running around unmasked, going parties, hugging kissing like nothing's happening.

Instead reporting meaningless statistics, think media would impact convincing people take precautions showed sick people got. People would stop think danger videoed sick people home, wheezing toe weak get up, telling camera feels like lungs collapsed.

So anyone video people actually sick? Otherwise, everyone around denies Covid-19 even exists.  huge spike already chart. explain deaths low now. teacher, love gnashing teeth ""students never recover this"" ""we need restore normalcy"" politicians.

No, motherfucker, pretty damn obvious want free babysitting service say parents ""you take care kids, get back work"". know kids *really* never recover from? parent dying illness kid believes responsible bringing home. point? easy explanation this. LARGE majority outbreak took place NYC, northern NJ, Washington Seattle area, Oregon, MA. medical systems overwhelmed, extension, death toll high. new outbreaks happening nation highly concentrated. far medical system cope outbreaks.

Additionally, median age new infections much younger, meaning death rate inherently lower. 

The next 2-3 weeks critical determine virus spreads new areas. comfortable inner layer second nose wire. good outbreak TXST already overrun Hays County?  *awaayyyyyyyyyy* go! No1: number death statistic matters

No2: 

No3: Europe French, also South American World

No4: Vega start due ""weather""

No5: France ... political shit show native French Guiana First vaccine AIDS, COVID? 

*Oh wait, there’s vaccine AIDS?* Plot twist... months later, half infected start developing symptoms, losing limbs, heart attacks strokes... /u/Colorado_blue posted thought east asians naturally immune coronavirus, troll worth entertaining vert careful, study called something chiffon, chiffon actual chiffon. felt joanns, chiffon. Ugh, I'm ready this. know preemptively mass producing huge batches go door get approval. 

I want know get it. one point saying soon September everything went perfectly. know issues low infection counts Britain, hopefully trials Brazil go better. Let's get thing done. basically choice matter here. many cases, even mild people sent home self-quarantine... put reopening hold various groups would baying moon calling head. hail Oxford! That’s shop, nincompoop! Bye bye boomer know they'll massive surges, simply likely hundreds thousands people close proximity probably effect.
 
Mitigating factors would protests outdoors, many protesters wore masks many protesters relatively young.
 
Critical factors would screaming/shouting increases risk spread, chemical agents used LEOs (when effect person is), fact many people infected remain asymptomatic throughout infection. Sorry see happen. Stay safe. vaccines effectiveness immunicompromised confirm inject someone know immunicompromised kill them? shop towels, blue things hardware store. Doesn’t confirm priors? context wearing masks public, lockdown. Unfortunately I'm sure good solution high cost living places. know good number people left Los Angeles soon knew good paying job gone. Many found good work pays little less. Whatever given going bumfuck Missouri San Francisco. really best source right now. wish charge whole governmental response. think would different place. mean benchmark solid 4 years cowboy great song. thought Chris Ledoux reason. fantastic write-up. Thanks. poorest wedding attended around 4-500 guests. typical lower middle class wedding around thousand guests. Well... no. % population infected say 5%. Testing 10k (these made numbers). test get 500 positive tests. 

So people get infected it’s spreading. 10% people it. test 5k times. Reported number positive cases still 500. Shutdowns, social distancing, masks mitigate test confirm. That's nonsense. talking ass.

We need talk hypothetical. plenty evidence New York long things take.

Here's [New York New York's spike really started mid-March. March 16, 2000 cases. March 27, 5000. death toll lag ""several weeks"" explosion cases. April 1, 400 deaths day continuing increase. New York's death count peaked April 7 - mere days cases peaked.

The idea took weeks doctors report deaths pure total nonsense. obviously basing nothing want believe rationalize fact Florida seen spike deaths. Solid accurate post downvoted. sub full ignorance. Also PA. I’d consider it. long. Yup county 86 beds. supports 6 county area. lot cities this. giving raises know budget cuts coming. months now, everyone forgets angry raises, reduce salary look like making sacrifice. Oh look, guy posts r/sino shilling China. Shocking.

It's okay criticize US downplaying numbers okay criticize China covering theirs. commitment truth, regardless stands way.

EDIT: Bring downvotes, truth hurts. anyone actually concerned recent wave propaganda r/coronavirus. suggest read Projection, always projection. We're start seeing Austin metro--patients transferred big hospitals MUCH smaller suburban/outlying rural hospitals nowhere near beds staff available. *really* gonna fucked it, doubly staff going much higher risk live area--most people Williamson/Bastrop/Hays counties wearing masks go out. trying dick really think lot people would benefit therapy. many people care.

Hell house live in, girlfriends dad proudly proclaims ""I think let everyone whatever whoever dies...dies. survival fittest "" seriously means Great news announced today schools re-open September without many stipulations younger children, increasing bit older kids.

Interestingly - government's document ""COVID-19 Interim Recommendations reopening schools educational facilities"" states, relation face Wearing Face coverings/masks   masks may reduce transmission individuals shedding virus. However, extent benefit unknown** (especially children) would potentially beneficial done properly. practical many students wear mask properly duration school day.  students requested wear facial covering may wish wear facial covering physical distancing difficult maintain discouraged.

Glad see Irish government buying current political (but scientific) narrative surrounding face masks.

Even happier see kids go back school.

We’re actually right here, hit hard early in. Everybody right cover act suspicious, expect make friends allowed use public private establishments. 

Assassin looking people never allowed normalized. Yeah 100% agree... I’m worried numbers represent cases week ago, since takes long get results back. actually 1 week ‘ahead’ already.

Also hospitals already filling up. Arizona hospitals already understaffed, seeing exponential increase people coming in. Houston deleted hospitalization data days ago reached 100% base ICU capacity. Florida medical workers pushing governor publicize hospitalization data.

These indications situation going get really, really bad. momentum virus altered weeks take action now... America Fuck Yeah! assuredly yours, one would ever fuck you. one chance available US September Oxford. it. None others even started Phase 3.

Wall Street estimating shy billion dollars revenue Remdesivir next year. assuming sell every single vial make. represents roughly investment it.

In October, Astrazenica start delivering 300 million doses Oxford vaccine USA. already paid $1.2B works $4 dose. works vitro monkeys challenge tests. effective, eliminate virus within next year. So, Gilead lose market share Remdesivir another drug nobody wants, maybe use future pandemic. then, it'll patent.

It also sounds like you’re referring daily death totals total projected deaths. So. Mr. Rice everyone else involved learning Covid works? “going forward...”. mean I’m country singer fan matter, seem gotten message back March?

If wanted report it, bothered writing comment. news bolded actually included article posted less day ago: 

So really, news here. work healthcare, know better totally isolated rest country one allowed town?   guess group friends probably different yours, even though seems dicks relatively length case. Maybe mine tend know lot climate/environmental activists, activists tend stronger opinions generally garden variety academic. ofc like attracts like. likely friends softer side spectrum re: situation since pro Swedish strategy. people know open interested discuss anything disagree. Come think Sweden.

I know fewer swedes irl Danes. IME Swedes know, mostly activists academics, able agree disagree friends wide range opinion. However, cannot say online Swedes I've come ""know"". I've never gotten many nasty personal attacks disagreeing since days used argue climate deniers. really remarkable tbh fascinating. Hospitals move surge capacity. 100% basically “comfortably” accommodate, amount accommodate pinch somewhat higher that. New York, hospitals instructed increase capacity 50%, additional facilities (i.e. Javitz Center) added top that. ""we'll put boot ass, American way!"" 🙄 Back March remember people saying stuff would get together even though stay apart think kind briefly believed it. people completely politicized health crisis using excuse awful ignore simple behavioral changes could help keep loved ones communities safe. Murica. Yes, teach academically competitive private school I’m sorry say you’re completely right, students extreme pressure keep class work (which involve multiple hours homework every night) teachers really inconsistent well support students absent. February several weeks row nearly 10% students teachers sick given day, many students would fever spike mid-morning (when Advil took home wore off) sent home early. One advisees tried come back bout illness soon passed middle class, requiring us call ambulance... likely normal round flu, Covid-19. know I, teacher, dragged school feeling bad strain reschedule class content, test dates, etc. already over-scheduled semester (and burdening colleagues substitute me) seemed worse “toughing out.” Add working parents don’t ability stay home child gets sick it’s hot mess.

We need much larger structural change better use online content flexible pivot remote learning students, teachers, etc., need stay home - protect other. guy happy we're unemployed. That’s it. outcome unpredictable it’s better safe sorry. Maybe many younger people testing positive back late winter medical field gotten much better treating severe cases. However, I'd wait little spiking low death ICU footballs. hope trend stays new surge getting started. Yes, yes, yes. Canadian, I've wanting weeks. Especially I'm Toronto, there's risk. Think that.

That's around (using 3K round number) 43 September 11ths. 

This absolute outrage. Worth noting projection wrong times pandemic IHME. Trumpmerican Way. “Hey great didn’t pee side pool!”

Covid know state boundaries. it’s great taking seriously, unified national response required. think anyone could imagined country would created grassroots anti-mask movement.

Im physician career. Thats it. calling. higher power. job. absolutely sign risk life. Hell no. cut barbaric cloth somehow normalized 100 hour work weeks residency general hostility see behind minty fresh advertising posters. way. 

I clock go home. Happily. COVID times Im way aware personal health. good tie spent training endanger health? Zero. 

Ive make call patients die. zero issue putting well patient. always going way place like California, committed lock well substantial cases without committing strategy keeping cases face substantial economic activity tools like testing/contact tracing/mandatory masks.

They shut stayed way absolutely give out. could keep providing unemployment. keep economy moving. Newsom opened back up. course *too fast*. gave time figure optimal level was. Compare Massachusetts, phased reopening soon cases low enough. Cases keep going down, keep opening up. basically finding long bars closed masks mandated, spread low exponential. Massachusetts basically knows much open up. California keep experimenting, cases rise, may need implement new lockdown get cases manageable again.

Everyone thought crazy thinking California dumb April, epitome ""wasting lockdown"" cautionary tale. student behave better get routinely tested.

Agreed. Total nonsense, especially since vast majority students live campus frat/sorority houses part town. feel horrible them. could prevented. Also majors classes often picked easiest workload possible without getting practical/ helpful major classes need that. Ask people get sick went protest, live someone did. say ""no"", engaging high risk activity like bars parties, say protests probably much. governors?? wish mine would that... (obviously) act fellow ""man""'s interests unless forced.

I pretty sure self-centered tendency varies region region country country. Canada, honestly say see way people care others not. Yes, are, ""all me"" people too, *but minority long way*. vast majority people kind courteous, act others best interests. I've seen articles Texas California. Also California much bigger state. sad world live in. sound like people trying prove smoking safe. I. I'm lucky live state that's mostly rural pretty low population, 3000 cases (cumulative, hovering 600 active now). Still wearing mask anytime leave house going anywhere except necessary errands work.

It sucks, sucks even probably going like long time, sucks less drowning body fluids. time reopen schools!  

*cries teacher* already flattened curve. political control. Look death counts. falling nationwide US. place cases still remain closed? 🙄 start lockdown, nearly packages expecting delayed, either days weeks. figured virus reason (like everyone ordering stuff online time). 

People need patient. stuff come eventually. need nasty mixer socks going bit late.  [This Roast them, much imaginary freedom. People spoiled. 

Good thing rest world  give fuck constitution ban us infecting them. 

We officially shit hole country now. current development rate, make billion dollars one year. can't make scale more. matches investment. CEO even said pretty much expect break even it. really mind company breaking even saving thousands lives. Same. 😢 You’ve got remember simple farmers. people land. common clay new West. know… morons. protest happened weeks lol. Everyone quarantined 1 new wave came on.

Did actually read article? correlation there, sorry, wrong. ""massive surge"" DOES, however, correlate re-openings. turns protestors safe protests, probably outside protests well, total effect transmissions less ""the virus big deal"" average joes going normal daily routines re-opened embarrassed party. Bunch hypocrites. ""You can't protest. going kill ppl!

LMAO wait, party again, telling protest this? kind Democratic Re-Open protestor? Sure, issue hand daily new cases number California beat several days now. article stated Texas worse population percentage would understand doesn't. Wrong, wrong. First, eat MacDonalds hamburgers, drink covfefe cover spray tan protect virus. Came say thumbnail chocolate trump putin tho There's lot fire focused on, least today's daily cases higher per capita TX CA quit year, went back could keep touch sister &amp; nieces...now I’m mad sister refusing mask up. I’m questioning FB now.  College aged people ones matter? faculty, staff 40K people live Ithaca matter? Ohhh think might messing you... rest world chance future Olympics fully runs US. images I've seen media white young. nurses.

And look graph see Texas' venture exponential growth started protests. May 1. Texas 30,000 positive cases. Memorial Day weekend, number cases reached 50,000. would think protests would contributed maybe eventually did, looks enough protesters made difference Texas. virus already taken over. also could give vaccinated people vaccine license, gives privileges. example, without license can't enter bar, stadium, theater, large gathering event; jobs could also require well. Although could unfair people health condition prevents vaccine, reasonable solution could maybe change many anti vaxxers minds find everything life. McDill AFB cases early base stopped reporting cases DoD put policy place. plenty bases cases Us oversea bases( South Korea confirmed). Also destroyer Gulf Mexico uss Kidd believe outbreak. True someone says ""as bad New York"" assume referring terrible peak. New York projected well average oct. 1 honestly, either aren’t seeing full effects protests yet they’re effect drowned reopening.

At end day, protests outside, lot dilute concentration virus air reduce transmission. course, you’re still going see increase transmission thousands out, bulk rise we’re seeing almost certainly reopening, look states seeing largest surges, virtually states reopened prematurely. said Governor Abbott issued executive order banning elective procedures unless ICU beds available.

Obviously, hospitals vested interest continuing elective procedures thus go way claim excess capacity, even truly exist. Well hope I'm *wrong,* sense Texans realize get bad fast take serious measures mitigate it. like say, people taking seriously, numbers coming everyday, especially past seven, discouraging bode well. sub LOVES miserable Surely already have? 40,000 confirmed cases I’d surprised 200,000 actual cases. mean, yes, different conversation.

Hyundai Kona SEL vs Model 3 Standard Range Plus

$37,190 vs $37,990

6.4s vs 5.3s

Range:

258mi range vs 250mi

Charging speed:

0-200 miles 55 minutes vs 0-200 miles 22 minutes  (So Kona cannot long road trips basically.)

Availability fast-chargers:

Meh vs Supercharger Network

Driver assist features:

None vs Autopilot included. (Lane keeping, lane changing, start stop CC, etc. things enabled Europe.)

No software updates vs free software updates

Warranties same

Cloth seats vs leather seats

7” touchscreen vs 15” touchscreen

When ongoing pandemic kills via pneumonia people wondering ""second"" wave fewer deaths first... seems pretty obvious causing five fold increase. Ah yes, ofc joke. That’s next response explicitly stated weren’t sure continent Mexico in.. it’s North America future reference.


Maybe rather generalizing entire continent beliefs minor portion one country, take time look map Nope, coming directly dutch CDC takes 4-5 weeks infected person's eventual death get officially reported. doesn’t need order, ‘supply issues’. legitimate issue, easily made worse inaction bad planning. Anyone brain level predict needing tests, fact didn’t prepare either means they’re extremely incompetent purposely trying suppress testing. population density CA, could cause tragedy next weeks.

It net loss every single student. risk dying virus low it’s statistically zero. fact easily dismiss reopening schools shows severe lack perspective.

I won’t even mention dramatically worse young already made pipeline? It’s indoor seating operations. People still sit outside. may best scenario - start lockdown numbers stay hospitals acquire PPE, open people get lockdown fatigue, numbers surge lock people cooperative they’ve seen else there. Protests outside makes huge difference. US states biggest spikes even protest states started weeks ago. doctor's methodology and/or evidence estimate? Live free die right? case might dying though. totally anecdotal therefore basically useless, I'll say anyway - younger people know, age - mid-20s - taking pretty seriously concerned it. experience older generations taking less seriously want ""fuck masks, fuck government, freedoms!"" Someone call Terry Crews now! Yeah people ""living lives"" caused parents deaths. I'm considering it, think might pass. specifically virus, things need tonight Given CDC estimates actual cases 10x high, would 10x high well (assuming normal demographic spread unreported cases, probably would skew younger still).

Edit: they're millionaires  Sure. still declining per week. Doesnt make topic discussion less true. i'm worried that. country make til vaccine comes out. Yeah agree, I've gone skiing, snowboarding, rock climbing pretty steep outdoor mountains find shit boring. Nothing like good Raid intense pvp match place that's graphing covid numbers based many tested?

If many people tested, see spike cases. want take equation. almost like 99% Reddit make thing political. Yes; around 11AM daily. 300-383 28% increase. That's lot. also, ""300"" deaths happened days weeks REPORTED within last 24 hours. going sell ""it takes 2-3 weeks deaths reported reflected official tally"" nonsense somewhere else.

I'm literally giving sources that, including one CDC. giving nothing dispute it. rejecting evidence want believe it. similar phenomenon Spanish Flu - researchers believe 1918 flu spared older people immunity it. theorize decades earlier version virus, one lethal spread like ordinary flu. 

The older people living 1918 would exposed less lethal flu developed antibodies. children, viral illnesses — measles, chickenpox — deadly young adults, may explain youngest spared 1918 epidemic. 

In case corona - young also spared, healthy adults whicg would suggest form natural immunity.

strawman.

people walking aroudn covid like people walking around shooting handguns anybody. people die.  reason people wear masks. protect them. objectively true, dig photo Chinese streets, YT video people walking around China, rare see anyone wearing pre panademic.

It comes to:

* smarter, educated informed population
* Government mandate enforcement
* Beijing made national policy early ""it's better people overly afraid afraid enough""
* Media that's fully transparent dangers virus, attempt downplaying
* Xi wore masks TV appearances, even speeches.
* mention people stupid? add that, addition able get ""yes, mask, and...."" (which huge problem itself) also become ""as long mask whatever want!"" (which arguably big problem).

You see way people act. completely binary. person wearing mask? ""Oh, one good people."" person minding business total isolation walking street without mask? ""OMG! idiot! literally going kill us!""

The level stupidity surrounding virus gets worse day. somewhat depressing. Never interrupt enemy making mistake - sun tzu

Imagine provoked someone people die result that. course minimize anything look things bigger picture. KELSO: BURRNN! get virus wear mask? Police used machine guns prohibition. Yeah don’t that! sense getting shit pathetic woman. think kind old hat. Many places especially major cities gigabit fiber now. Rural areas aren’t lucky.

Good night... good luck. DJT. family friends daughter tested positive came long ago showed absolutely symptoms crazy I’m praying hard love family sm!I know I’m going get shit I’m confess owning mistake yes realize I’m idiot came along maybe 20 people celebrate daughters first birthday...so going see moms younger sisters tests come back giving warnings guests oh god feel terrible selfish don’t know happened protests happening also getting cold feet 3-4 days get together knew absolutely way going get worse cases protests honestly biggest mistake entire life selfish . count one hand countries done worse.. totally believe you. That's shitty part entire thing. expect people take social distance seriously demand business shut safe hundreds people inches apart. I'm lucky never went school indoctrinated people like that. perfectly normal public schools, too. 

But live liberal bubble (and thankful days) that's probably why.  another reason dislike genre. also add going stores even restaurants, staff masked. Aren’t required employees? Ya know, point even care rationale use get people wear long wear them.  man soul. Given intelligence responses I'd say 70-80% responses bots. We're probably humans thread. mean isnt country music enough kill people, got compound problem adding concerts covid. Either way idiots put idiots went tempting fates Covid dont give two craps , infect , kill either someone locale almost undoubtedly. callousness people times shown country falling apart. dont care neighbor pandemic dont care family/friends. proves idiots went dont care noone. Exactly, know single thing neither viruses viral infections.  We're referring Americans here...and get lecture people. Sorry. high school friend works large Texas hospital. said control, relatively speaking, 2 weeks ago. One week ago, unraveled basically filled up, constantly needing use surge capacity. Now, absolute crisis. sounds bad NY Italy, many deaths.

JUST WATCH FOOTAGE HOUSTON HOSPITAL. decreasing death rate, patients stay sick weeks make far. recover slowly even leave. many healthy 30-50 year olds never even though live. Opposite Springs. 80% unmasked. minority get tired looked I’m masked. wait, thousands people streets protesting middle global pandemic wasnt good idea? Who'da thunk it. country lost Florida doesn’t slow could free long term costs Medicare. However grandparents still alive would person bullhorn governor’s home yelling nightly feel bad Onion writers days. Kids gotta fuck. It’s good at.  think soon people started see data manipulated media emphasize different messages, actual numbers stopped meaningful NH absolutely right. silly binary mask debate drowned discussion risk factors - specifically environmental, actual #1 factor getting infected. 


Put simply, never get ""Yes, mask, and...."" know say definitively protests lowered amount cases, Denver seeing increase cases since ~June 10th.   lack 7th grade understanding percents work, misread data CDC

Where see that? bot? designed find numbers someone's response criticize math actually show could corrected?

C19 pretty prevalent therefore lethal. Oxford vaccine phase 3. Google phrase oxygen thing true. Wearing mask doesn’t reduce amount oxygen get know deaths lag, almost something else going well. Deaths slowly decreasing even three week massive case increase (which isnt testing due percentages going up). means either protecting high risk better increased much treatment skills. would think point thered level increase total deaths. citation, class one misdemeanor, carries fine $2,500 convicted. 

Hatten said Tuesday’s press conference he’d willing pay fine wants fight business — others — remain open pandemic. 

I hope fine escalates subsequent convictions. Fine idiot everyday. That’s exactly point - studies looking first-wave statistics: protesters young likely experience mild (if any) symptoms.

We’re month protests started, see increases cases Minnesota California, along states like Florida Texas.

My point is, gathering crowds increases risk, prime example point: People excusing known behaviors increase transmission fits political narrative. could swap defense someone wanting small businesses open haircut. thing. Fear best weapon every politician pocket. Nothing comment says anything ""pro strategy"" Simple, eat rich. NYC remember using 18 day metric telling everyone it'll get worse far could observe, right. sirens day night week. Go Bears 🐻 would never happened shit together first place. Asian countries like Taiwan Korea recommending masks start.

Instead, US:

**""Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!""**

\-US Surgeon General, February

**""There reason anyone walking around mask on""**

\-Dr. Anthony Fauci, March

The ramifications initial mistakes, make mistake, I'm calling mistakes, still felt today, likely completely hampered effectiveness public policy response involving masks, going forward.

*These things real consequences, seeing play out.* could seen coming? medical community lied ensure medical community enough N95 surgical masks CDC failed procure enough clear pandemic hands. 

To credit, stick guns lie like certain key decision makers reversed course clear simple cloth covering, protecting wearer much, limits spread wearer presymptomatic yet contagious symptomatic mild symptoms easily confused cold allergies.

The big reason people wear masks made political thing. wear one, must liberal. want confused liberal choose focus mask protect rather protect others them. think bury heads sand feel obliged feel guilty wearing one.

The debate's dumb. difficult wear mask minutes going store logically stops droplets coming mouth get others. everyone wore mask, return shutdowns would necessary virus spreading enough warrant it. cases skyrocketing states mask wearing frowned upon. exponential increase would ruin plan. government infection rate gets high enough. Hillary it, Biden it. Maybe Biden's kid it? Lets see ""allies"" look us. Tesla bigger Elon Musk virus damn terrifying. flipped owner urgent care people walking clinic WITHOUT MASKS Covid testing. supposed get tested cars wear masks. baby home younger children starting get admitted issues. son THREE people lives healthcare it’s damn terrifying. really strange treat poor little failures wealthy gods. They're still irresponsible canceling it’s fucking medical new year.

Baby nurses, green interns, senior residents quite skill needed independent senior nurses attendings need be, honestly brand new attendings getting swing things yet credentialed. Senior nurses left floor go NP CRNA schooling, brand new NP’s, CRNA’s, PA’s tossed fire.

On top student nurses medical students trying prove get training need.

So lower normal manning plus lowest possible experience level.

My heart breaks right now.

PS hacking anyone all, incredible beings much little, much manning experience trough July. Godzilla might saving San Fran murder hornets something though. news still? said early March made masks, of...you guessed it, cotton! Based advice online! proving point mods care one side. dislike politicians equally. I'm sorry, see evidence whatsoever. Texas running hospital beds. 600 new hospitalizations yesterday. buddy works Orange County respiratory therapist said pretty much beds ventilators. need think bigger picture Cain go found city banished? He's saying ""Yes, potential death"" sure. terrible time live professionals demonized standing regardless merit. 'my ignorance good knowledge,' kind crap. Maybe recovered? Dang it! even part EEA, either. TIL, thanks! I'll never understand people use simple, common sense deduce wearing mask properly absolutely add layer protection potentially contaminated particles (e.g. spit/phlegm) entering exiting mouth nose. though brainwashed; sides aisle.

This kind misses point: people information economy perform professional services arent losing jobs scale people service economy are. They're working home low risk spreading virus.

I wouldnt need UBI (knock wood), like didnt need stimulus check. waste money government give me, others like me. Trump wanted good headlines (""everyone gets check!"") instead smart policy. Direct money specifically people whose livelihoods lost. 

This also much practical, simple approach compared quickly implementing unprecedented UBI program. Sorry hear :( hope find way lay rest soon Same.

Tesla better anyone, resulting air quality path rapid improvement, Musk thank that. flaws, took singular vision get done. Must *serious* shortage import Sweden, then. mean, compare current outbreak situation Norway Sweden, 8,887 vs. 68,451 confirmed cases total, hear news Norway one import healthcare workers (without quarantine!)

People die. People scarred life. don’t care SMALL number is. need protect neighbors family POSSIBILITY infection, possibility horrible outcomes real. discussion threat disservice entire world. Here's ridiculous. Forgetting horrific optics fact remdesivir shown prevent deaths covid-19, reasonable ask long 500,000 doses remdesivir Trump bought -- 90% world production next three months -- last us.

A single treatment remdesivir requires six doses, means Trump bought treat 83,000 people. US averages well 35,000 new cases per day, even restrict supplying remdesivir cases hospitalized, CDC [recently 14% cases hospitalized, means US hospitalizing 5000 people per day.

So means -- current infection levels -- supply last US sixteen days. Even restrict use 7% people covid patients go ICU -- despite lack evidence prevents deaths -- 32 days worth current infection levels.

This raises inevitable question, Trump going distribute this? going burn entire supply next 16-32 days, going ration it, banking looks like coming surge? rationing it, criteria Trump use determine supplied remdesivir, much get, patients actually receive doses?

And remdesivir really important drug fight covid-19, Trump actually something dramatically increase production, US rest world? temporarily suspending Gilead's patent utilizing Defense Production Act gear pharmaceutical companies produce vast quantities drug needed US worldwide? meanwhile 11 Ford workers died C 19 also surprising written Washington post Elon called Jeff Bezos multiple times annd honestly Elon hate kinda cringy nothing coronavirus Exponential effect kicking in...

I know it’s huge pain ass home...but seems better option hospital, possibly ventilator, unable see family. adjust perspective, choice becomes pretty easy make! Agreed completely. still try assume best others, assume they're best can. Getting upset one person ANYTHING going cause stress yourself.

You best rock. 🌻 would take years hospital overload reach. vaccine safer likely available then. October ? Antibodies need disappear. would horrible body constantly antibodies it. don’t want immune system constantly fighting. 

It’s body’s memories (in cells) antibodies matter. made X.com merged paypal believe. F STOP POSITIVITY!! SITE NEGATIVE DOOM TALK!!

WE DIE LIKE IT!! think generally .1% infections, obviously Florida testing everyone know real # infections Several scientists specializing infectious disease believe lower Oh awesome, realize don’t understand guy moron  looking data. I’m fucking economist, third grader uses Google. interesting local authorities try enforce mask policy well. Get ready whole bunch non-MAGA folks join ""you cant make wear mask!"" crowd. Where's 5th Amendment? first month, many families enough money pay rent. help? work hospital. know many covid patients I've cared for? know me. Excuse language, go F U C K No. business person, work area involving intellectual property.

First, national level, countries could ignore patent plow forward. There’s little done it’s urgent needs life saving drugs.

But even could enforce... moron wouldn’t agree take full price drug don’t even bother make?

Edit: Normally agreements would treated proprietary secrets almost always agreed license price less full price drug don’t want let got best deal door. Covid real. isn’t conspiracy keep businesses closed. right thing. even know long immunity lasts. get 80% ""herd immunity"" we'd need 300,000 positive cases EVERYDAY 2 YEARS. covid ends like coronavirus immunity might last 1 year. even get 80% people got would already losing immunity never actually get 80%. 


Not mention 300,000 cases per day would would 500,000 American dying per year plus another 10 MILLION hospitalized. can't without healthcare systems failing. 


Herd immunity infection 2nd retarded idea I've seen yet involving Corona barely behind drinking bleach. thought figured ago weren’t built slave labor. 

Didn’t find whole tomb something celebrating honoring workers? do? Coronavirus: “You say goodbye say hello

Go volunteer Bell, Regius Professor Medicine Oxford University, said Britain prepare COVID-19 vaccine winter encourage people get flu vaccinations avoid “pandemonium” whole epidemic relied heavily assumptions turned true,” strong advice prepared worst.” I’m pushing narrative. I’m pushing facts. Want another fact...deaths US absolutely start increase again. Enjoy lull thanks NY. Closing restaurants definitely right move, think aren’t considering wide range food options city. area, korean BBQ king. Grilling table, unlimited sides, rounds beer soju—it’s much experience. dishes best served extremely hot stone pots rice gets crispy dish stays warm whole time. meals remaining juices whisked away staff mixed rice vegetables table. 

I haven’t eaten restaurant since feb won’t eating quite time, think it’s discrediting scoff don’t need restaurant food good. true all. multiple studies showing COVID deaths actually understated. believe me, go look data deaths normally state/county time right now. Factor reported deaths, still large number excess death attributed kinds things. take word it, go look. justified, financial crisis follow health crisis going hurt much different way. almost like Texas Florida volunteering run experiment see bad get shut fully. guess taking one team. One time, Horsemen. One time. Wrong

[Swine Flu Ancestor Born U.S. Factory traced genetic lineage new H1N1 swine flu strain emerged 1998 U.S. factory farms, spread mutated alarming rate. Experts warned pocket virus would someday evolve infect humans, perhaps setting global pandemic. Who? I’m glad mentioned this, thank you. gut feeling check lungs weeks ago, post push needed. UK locked week late. hit point rapid, exponential growth cases infections went hundreds per day hundreds thousands per day quickly.

There lag getting infected hospital admission but
even lockdown, people catch disease prior lockdown continue spread disease family many conspiracy theories Florida. expect shit right-wingers Florida conspiracies left promoting reminder let politics guide going take truth. problem FLA official numbers follow Dr Rebekah Jones' dashboard instead. death total much different Florida's. places it, others aren’t. Still humidity variable. Suck big humid sweaty dick key Bell, Regius Professor Medicine Oxford University, said Britain prepare COVID-19 vaccine winter encourage people get flu vaccinations avoid “pandemonium” hospitals. Herd immunity public health solution problem. Understanding works it’s implications great science. CNN reported it. Good. know go back stricter lockdown. million people going die shit. idea courts still physically open, example. 3 new cases city prague yesterday case anyone wants context. There's part RNA virus ability detect potentially ironic victims attacks frequently. 

DISCLAIMER: doctor joke made amount ironic cases we're seeing lately (mostly caused stupid people unaware others call ""consequences""). headline reads ""This working, stop!?"" definitive title? definitive right now. relevant? Saying ""everyone's bad it"" throwing hands air cop-out, anti-Science. excuse never wrong discredit people actually willing draw conclusions, even wrong. “The impact absolutely devastating,” said Stobbs. “The difficulty family left home educate child lack provision school local authority almost unimaginable, impact terms physical mental wellbeing going deep and, fear, lasting.""

Again, solvable problem government care solving.

An individual solution systemic problem always result gaps. understanding, high mask compliance (and basically every protocol \*except\* social distancing, obviously) accounts that. Protests appear seen slight increase infection, least places higher avg (and cases, lower). Cases also offset due ""anti-protesters"" actively avoiding protests themselves, increases social distancing behaviors, thus balancing increase cases due protests.

So unless everyone mask compliant uses hand sanitizer, \*not\* attend concert decide must social distance avoid concert-goers, probably see large increase cases concert people going ""normal"" day. powerful entities control everything believe vaccine effective produced timely, that's good news.  They'd know better us. want miss gains economy bounces back, believe bounce back.  

To broader point though, health stock market helps keep people employed prepared retirement. everyone U.S. benefits stock market going up, but, super-rich either. Exactly point.

Well, wrong That's crazy. numbers essentially implying things bad, conducted amount tests, different picture would painted.

Assuming constant test positivity rate, 70k tests: 6,563/0.64 = 10,254 cases... Work home. Damn, sorry hear that. trying go? 🙏 Spain. really needed good news today! We'll see guess.

My college switched classes online till spring (hoping prolong it, I’m personally really scared especially one year old), actually work private school children young adults disabilities. don’t know why, think it’s good idea keep one campus open. get it’s difficult, pretty hard comes hygiene. 

I personally don’t mind, since corona cases rising hardcore here, don’t think it’s okay. also can’t imagine students willing keep masks (at least low functioning students).

Hope helps! Source: teacher misses teaching. bankroll that? seem realistic most. muh re-election Oh shes staying me. Shell parents. wont even see here. I'll see visits best times really big change  home trip looking foreign cars Karlstad city far norwegian border.

I drove around parking lots two large shopping centers (Bergvik Välsviken) looked around 500 cars. Result: 4 Norwegian, 1 German 1 Irish car. rest Swedish plates.
Conclusion: extremely tourist abroad compared normal. three kids (6, 4, 1) 4 year old one people. annoying.

“Hey bud, don’t jump entire flight steps—you hurt yourself!”

“I didn’t hurt myself!”

“Maybe time, statistically one times will.”

And keeps hurts he’s **surprised pikachu face** I’m like “well think would happen?! warned?!”

These children become adults. Ugh. MCo (movement control order aka lockdown) implemented early. government good things regards covid19. dad lives kuala lumpur could leave house week essential shopping questioned time time. also banned export masks (he's trying send avail) somehow managed stock sanitiser, masks etc set price limits stayed affordable. Local food drops low income families struggling without work. dad told me, really impressive (although course without fault like response) halted spread it. long cycle go for? going 1. Oh shit huge problem 2. Wear mask, stay inside 3. Curve cases kind flatten 4. People act like nothing wrong 5.

I'm saying bad thing wearing mask. I'm saying takes LOT putting mask expecting things change better. Look Northern EU, see majority citizens public wearing masks, show progress breaking curve without mask initiative took initiatives, helped change societies way behaving / adopted broke curve without masks public. 
Rather new way engaging socially public that's addiction already this?? According article driver protests prompted people stay home.

So really saying fine gather large groups long follow social distancing wear mask. saying effect, net increase number people stayed home, uptick.  news subtitled Swedish, English Arabic. bring what’s said press conferences.

Bring on. That’s happens limit testing. Big brain politics small brain public health. Lowering testing positivity rises 5% insane. masks work. wife make sure always wear n95 mask going patient room extra careful.

Quarantine:
Stay home 14 days last exposure.
Check temperature twice day watch symptoms COVID-19.
If possible, stay away people higher-risk getting sick COVID-19.

“Isolation” person positive either lab-confirmed symptomatic.

Note: I’m nurse educator. right nothing C 19 work conditions wach get upvoted reddit front page anyway June 29-30 public opinion poll found 81% American adults said “very” “somewhat” concerned pandemic, since similar poll conducted May appear rising among members crimson team, generally expressed less interest others wearing face masks sheltering home even pandemic infected 2.6 million Americans.

Almost like pandemic exploding control crimson states looking like country might half dozen NYCs end month. going make comments like please use /s daily briefings (or maybe daily anymore) provided? Cause website linked basically FHM 1177 website information Sweden - general recommendations larger policy updates, daily numbers statistics. Pretty much anyone ex WWE employees nothing nice say man. shouldn’t surprise anyone  plus salons/tattoo parlors controlled spaces. sit client down, make sure masked (and make sure you’re masked up), provide service, send way. Bars crowded mask-less patrons move freely building long want PLUS add alcohol whatever efforts socially distance go right window.  you’re first, you’re last idiocy cut throat milch cow. 

Do really think Chinese students, largest group international students, going come USA? \+50 million people unemployment benefits cut approximately $250 week. Seeing economy consumer driven economy based consumer spending.... lot people consuming goods services there's money. Trump administration gambled pandemic lost. spreading like wildfire across south, midwest southwest - historically regions vote red election. Way kill voting base, Trump.  


Everyone get ready next round stimulus, extended Pandemic UI SBA PPP loans. Often flu seasons, yeah. 

Look it’s ideal, wear masks advanced hygiene much news sensationalized nonsense comment would require /s ? Oh god dammit, Cold Stone. Please shitbags this, really like ice cream I'll refuse go stores treat employees like shit mask policy. Per capita testing stats absolute bullshit. need test everyone whole country. Increasing Covid tests per capita overall would mean testing northeast, south, central etc. states need rapid testing. 

Our positivity rate well 5% Mumbai Delhi started screwing up. decent testing except 2 cities. Positivity rate far accurate metric since rely everyone tested. country manufacture required number tests bring testing numbers upto level US developed countries. complete lack visible lockdown affect daily data highlights

We supposed reach 1,300,000 cases begining May. 2 months since begining May around 500,000 cases. explosive growth positivity rate states still control. Pretty visible lockdown effects. really specifically Orlando, UF, Orlando suburb, black majority county state (not FSU)

In words obvious exceptions rule inland Florida much still hickville

So course that’s Corona might strike worst almost news media politicians decided precisely permitted congregate large groups not. Holy shit. 15% positivity?! That’s fucking insane, like actual herd immunity without vaccine insane. get there, let’s open Disney World make sure oldest vulnerable back Rona rollercoaster make sure get too! /s

At point DeSantis get labeled murderer. It’s absolutely disgusting meanwhile God-King worried CNN polling numbers. watch families torn apart. 7,000 children test positive worried NBA season. Doomsday Preppers looking less crazy everyday.   burned across dozens places viruses do. 

It burn South July like Northeast Midwest. Everybody move act like nothing happened. e new hot spot hyperventilate about. Explain I'm asshole pointing single digit death total statistically insignificant compared total child deaths. 675 US children 13 die annually occupants motor vehicles. Obviously individual case tragedy national news article one would ridiculous. New York yesterday revised death total disease 3 2. constant articles fear mongering they'll cause harm good since they'll terrify parents already stressful time. never encountered Ebola scare CDC much involved training education.

Our medical staff used spoon fed requirements protocols, get analysis paralysis placed positions think critically.

It's wild. continue urge shut many times economy destroyed. Instead ordering first time making sure things control avoid multiple shutdowns. sure. find another line work. Live sound engineers going demand quite time. could listen Townes Van Zandt day.

More people need realize good fucking deluded? virus effectively bring heel mask policy. big problem epidemic stupid ass Karens refuse wear masks care feelings science. Yet, still state messed data start First thing I'm going shit blows share sandwich stranger. Interestingly enough, immediately proved assumption correct. could get job, but.

Yeah, he's probably going live sound engineer while. industry kind messed up. Time investigate avenues earning living. lose house. call. 

## Abstract

On 30 January 2020, World Health Organisation identified COVID-19, caused virus SARS-CoV-2, global emergency. risk factors already identified developing complications COVID-19 infection age, gender comorbidities diabetes, hypertension, obesity cardiovascular disease. risk factors, however, account 52% deaths arising COVID-19 often seemingly healthy individuals. paper investigates potential link SARS-CoV-2 bacterial load, questioning whether bacteria may play role bacterial superinfections complications pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis. connection COVID-19 complications oral health periodontal disease also examined, comorbidities highest risk COVID-19 complications also cause imbalances oral microbiome increase risk periodontal disease. explore connection high bacterial load mouth post-viral complications, improving oral health may reduce risk complications COVID-19.

## Key points

* Describes COVID-19 associated risk factors developing complications.
* Investigates whether bacteria contribute COVID-19 complications causing bacterial superinfections.
* Examines whether link oral microbiome COVID-19 complications. advertise want. 14 day non paid quarantine work travel big 4 spiking states right now. 

Already cancelled trip paid last year supposed happen September. fair question say number positive notes Sweden.

I personally want see harm come anyone country. One frustration see Anders Tegnell time time say rest world got wrong. live region seen case community spread since April 23. took defined measures combined specific advice test trace isolate. dumb one's. Thanks. Yeah I'm always certain wear mask whenever go out. suggesting scientists fund opening Etsy store? literally slowing testing joke cool hate Elon Tesla Unfortunately possible. Considering know 50%+ people CoVid symptoms exceptionally minor symptoms, quite possible reached herd immunity tested, would realize that.  Full send bra Yeah, good time bring back nation eliminated curve, also exponentially grown curve. hope deal depression Please wake we're great again. k thanks. hard human testing Ebola there's many cases.

That's time consuming part testing vaccine. 

In pandemic lot quicker get useful data quickly. vaccine could fail phase 2 3, go back drawing board, phase 1 again, would still enough active cases going around another phase 2/3 test. data article posted reply to. 

Hell, comment haven’t read it? 
Even without reading study, - literal subtitle article says stay home increased. wish someone mentioned dispute Rand Paul’s argument today. I’m thankful way governor handled things, looking disaster Florida. I’ve never liked much really respect handled situation. Mike DeWine. us locked pretty early on, though think pressured letting stay home order early. Unreal( They'll stay (funeral) homes dead bodies! fully agree that. end 2 idiots voting leads it. Also two giant parties act like mob... manifested congress supporters cater tribalistic garbage. goes beyond people voted ended selection had. Ranked choice voting would lot closer democracy now. Could send link one them? I'm confused. No. Unless you’re talking advanced subjects calculator obviously necessary. Vlsvk people risking lives every day stuff like going run suburb waiting line supermarket. situation dire this, yes, think significant difference sunbathing beach requires urgent action, even face pandemic.

You free disagree like so, think sunbathing protesting oppression thst going decades acting hypocritical. Sad! Jones Taylor counties combined population 151,708 

combined coronavirus cases - 1011 count you’re first gen Masks mandatory VA, there's consequence wearing them. go Ace Hardware, 100 people line, one mask on. Go CVS, everyone mask on. Drive ice cream shack, 200 people outside, one mask on. Go lowes, 1 10 mask on. Go grocery store, everyone mask on. 


I actually grocery store, necessity, sat 10 feet away watched 4 different women pick analyze red peppers put back, went find 1 liked. touched red peppers... Holy fuck... needed red peppers, bought them. sanitized soon hit truck. Got home washed shit red peppers. hella gross people touching produce... 


Like people even fkin think? 


I'm ashamed part country worst reputation pandemic. Hey Spain, don’t want Florida anymore. lol @ going supermarket sitting barber. Nice logic assume proven otherwise Rand Paul said couldn’t happen today Toronto population Houston, looking focussed comparison USA-Canada, compare two cities idea two countries doing, relative one another.

Spoiler: look good Houston. unironically. style might abrasive, going get anyone killed like plague rats might. watched fearfully NYC went hard played smart. let’s hope watching states go hard remind us stay scared. Thanks links ;) Damn man real self control would stomped ngl lol Lol guy jelly Canada

Typical  Yep! Even us Texas 😉 another lockdown like Christmas right now. INO produced actual product 40 years business, yet government money keeps rolling in. sad thing accurate actually is. They're going stay holed disease-free bunkers buy property stock cheap, world recovers coronavirus, wealth gap even worse before. Happened 2008, happen again. guy jelly Canada lol driving need move seen ANYTHING going executed. Another lockdown sounds good right now. dont see deaths youre assuming places closer 0 deaths number daily. That’s interesting. I’d heard anything that! We’re long ways Galveston need help don’t cancel events. data? lot people seem confused part ventilators personal property. isn’t designed “BYOV” rich people (though guess could side effect). It’s disabled people ventilators long-term. many fear seek medical treatment reason ventilators taken away (to given non-disabled people covid) left die. It’s actually legitimate concern disability rights lawyers working protecting people. #wide putin Weekend Bernies worry, they'll ramp back soon enough CO getting inundated tourists states. fit agenda coming conversation though pretending understand point poster’s post. 150+ days later. in-fucking-sane. doesn’t apply bars serve food, live bars. I’ve seen lot people’s true colors exposed (even family members) past months pandemic. Really shows much individualistic culture US. Hey step earth doing? Wow Fauci caught guard could say. hilarious think treatment automatically becomes worthless president mentioned it

thats science works

if trump said oxygen healthy hold breath you?

its used thousands hospitals country successfully, studies proving safe. look up. medicine place political bullshit

if can't see passed political bias MEDICAL ISSUE, ""you people"" insufferable

ive vocal critic trump years btw, ACTUAL issues, baseless russia gate pissgate nonsense

so sure hell think mean 'you people' without doubt another inaccurate unscientific assumption Rob Ford never ran Prime Minister Canada. It’s late. I’ve played enough plague inc know it’s slowing now. everyone wearing masks wont matter 🤗 People don’t like reading study. fauci stop dancing around scaremongering.

""wear mask ventilator"" pish

""anti science, anti vaccination feeling"" posh

just say ""Fuck assholes, wear damn mask, fat fucks"" Proof norm: rampant contagion pace. at? Agree use realistic test environment. good study would take account. coughing/sneezing elbow, bear mind respiratory droplets produced talking breathing too.  local strip clubs advertising billboard ads photos strippers wearing face masks. Still seems like big risk take lap dance. UK (as Italy Belgium) least trending downward, France Spain leveled out. fear end July, US exceed Belgium deaths per capita without major intervention miracles. US statistically benefit spread population. New York rest Northeast getting hit hard, places like Florida Texas weren't. Floridians Texans got complacent (P.s. - Texan vouch anecdotally).

My big beef saw going Italy Spain, still execute measures curb this. may late NY/NJ + New England (though way nursing homes managed baaaad) local hotspots), handled so, much better. stands now, county \~275,000 people brink. primary supplier testing kits stopped supplying us (there 4 test done past Monday, compared Monday before), ICU days away capacity even relocating non-Covid patients.

So think we've handled pandemic worst - that's probably Brazil - US leaders absolutely bungled this. think makes American anti-US point view. check death totals. Rank state get back rest country. TON manufacturing done China though. USA little manufacturing. little keep afloat. already antagonized. thing could get store. Penis remdevisir thing working?

I saw studies say doesnt, one study whichs says shorten hospital stay, mortality  FREEDUMB YEAHHHH 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 want write another less flippant comment. I'm man university professor. course work stopped took childcare housework duties. wife works medical supplies worked fulli home. nice counter BBC identity politics. First line article says scientists -suspect- therefore real evidence. article goes symptoms long term effect body cases. BBC scientific source aswell. proof statement prior comment. one fear mongering people suspect. Pittsburgh? death rate hospitalization lower flu karen every moron take medical hijab go hell. downvoted earlier replied thread southern states - commented posted article US. think came across comment bombing, good numbers nothing particular comment replied to. seriously suggesting wear level PPE groceries person working Bio-lab? can't thick... #RON DESANTIS EATS GIANTS PIECES SHIT BREAKFAST ""No Mask PREFERRED"" America 100 years...

no wait, bad you, cholesteral 
... actually nm, turns that's good cholesteral 


I mean, kids school used told case nuclear attack, get desk. Lewis Black hilarious standup that. 


Everything always wish washy. this, wait that, nm right first time. seems also external monologue caught early enough, clusters contained hard work. New Rome fall.

can't wait get out. could add u/GoingGray62 said below, one important things state emergency declaration generally allow budgetary flexibility. sure true case general allows agencies purchase equipment easily perhaps reallocate funds. example big storm maybe road resurfacing funds might reallocated flood control equipment. equipment could purchased immediately without competitive bidding. executive even though that's legislature intended.

Again, know that's true situation, general that's important part emergency declaration.  Mark words, year we'll least 2-3 people permanently damaged health every death. way influence others average person. argue personal responsibility part audience want, care outcomes, I'd hazard say Joe Rogan swaying portion audience wear masks. He's using exact rhetoric average viewer resonates with: masculinity. think far pragmatic expect one person take influence seriously expect every single person listens buy bullshit. Especially considering people could endanger others. someone's grandma dies dipshit Rogan fan wear mask words, yes, I'd put portion blame Rogan.

Not mention apparently got lot notion Elon Musk, even guilty lot audience worships Tony Stark science genius. Musk played Covid Tesla quarterly earnings goal that, met, would netted $720mil bonus. that's neither there. maybe instead drawing conclusions thin air look data says social distancing increased overall cities protests non-protesting population stayed home usual. wish island. :( I’d consider comment civics. wasn’t advocating political group. it’s guys. US going reach herd immunity end next year, way things going. time vaccine available average person, need gone. 'new normal' BS; got past Spanish Flu, get past way (With masks on, over) back ""normal."" don’t hear news awful job Sweden doing. always hear USA spectacular failure even though took ton precautions lockdowns non-rural states. Heck, Washington still even little open yet. told horrible failure country. Meanwhile hear nothing anymore Sweden mainstream media news. wearing mask person near Corona wearing mask chance catching virus reduced 80% Look up. internet. new dont believe countries Reptilian statues make so. would statues never real? sad Americans ashamed country. Asia wearing masks far longer time SARS. please, point Studie thst shows masks defenitly helpful public COVID19 older mid march. I'll waiting here. niosh rated respirator protect wearer. cloth mask extremely unlikely too. Think masks like cars. Ferrari going performance minivan.  Eat Governor? Eat Governor. COVID deaths 100% Yo pain!!!!! traveling Germany / Spain / Brazil durig beginning March. wondering chest pain, doesn’t really affect breathing often feel Texas here; bartender. been. waiting day stuff like too. Seeing red Google Maps tourist spots CA last month half discouraging. What’s typical duration T-cell mediated immunity? makes less stupid how? (American) boss still get I'm going year, we'll see 2021... fucking load shit pulled ass. makes fucking difference. 

The social change happened last 3 weeks unquantifiable, further.

Jfc. retarded post. think US send press release says “we longer defend Canada way. it.”  friendly reminder queens son boys one biggest child trafficker history, girls flown states.
Also photographed pedo island.

Straight facts

Fuck royal family need either workout Again, several factors:

* Early on, admitted hospital get test early meaning close death already time tested positive
* We're seeing less eldery getting infected right due states stay quarantine
* Hospitals moving away Ventilator usage
* treatments help somewhat like steroids
* Social distancing things likely mean people get infected getting milder cases average

That said, believe see deaths start sharply rise within 2 weeks Figures would happen again. paying rent anymore evictions paused, rental company allowed shit literally build side house. working septic pump. Kitchen sink stopped draining pours yard. Water damage turned mold crumbling walls, roof getting moist leaking soon. Hole rusted bathtub. That's starters. paid rent full every month. Neither us got stimulus checks due fuck ups doing, even though qualify. lost income rely one income. sent MULTIPLE people house take pics things never fix it.They taking advantage situation thinking gonna leave without pissed? got legal aid drafted notice, really want bother putting money escrow knows ever get back. lololol... streamed “protests” going 2-3 weeks ago looked like fuckin party going on. bet negligable number new cases arizonians read could article behind paywall.

I stand behind theories. concern many protesters would get sick spread disease around, least far doesn’t appear happened. Orlando, Gainesville and...?

The map Florida's counties voted 2015 dont think government sanctioned people realize vaccine get going need distribution supply chains management top get out? 

I don’t understand people think vaccine going magically save us can’t even get right testing. 

Maybe testing procurement distribution complicated don’t much faith right now. Funny government lies people repeatedly, nobody trusts anything. boy cried wolf situation. know that. makes sense, now, though: brain freezes eventually start killing parts brain... like countries did. US like accept good working policy countries....they think know needs example elected them. dear leader mean pappu, right? posted link CDC facts, mention global conspiracy

infact CDC clearly admits lumped presumed numbers code 7.1 defiance recommendations use U07.2 unconfirmed

i unfamiliar specifics countries data, US president actual retarded person. government product years dysfunction, greed, short-sightedness. hit 100k anytime October we’re beyond screwed. We’re currently 550k tests day it’s expected close 1m 10/1. means positivity rate 10%.. scientists say need less 3% open safely. doubt doubt doubt. 10 pack face masks Target like $15. hard that? me... I'm panicking. Mostly actual food shortage possibilities... even that's likely. 

It's late game, lucked deep freezer last weekend bought food vacuum sealer online. matter respectfully stocking supply. make feel better least week food available... something control anyway. /shrug Aaah, ""The Expert"".

lol Nicotine smoking shown many studies preventative effect. progressed point showing symptoms, going effect. need get plane ticket CAN'T ~~NICE THINGS~~ DOWNWARD TREND CORONAVIRUS CASES!!

That customer go straight heck. every year lifetime (or lifetime) one ever bad enough can't least serve bad example. toon PRESSURE make happen? govt PRESSURED sharing facts?
This country mess. Leavenworth, Kansas
Leavenworth, Washington?

Where? That's 12%. Awful. now, 2 weeks later? There's *New* England? Probably bit late now. contact tracing system!!! It’s important government isolates infected potential infections 2-3 weeks advance. 

Which country doesn’t adequate contact tracing??? moved Texas PA right huge explosion (quarantined tested negative). Really dodged bullet. Places know employees don’t tell customers.  read posted. 20% whole NYC, big portion staying home. protesters people obviously staying home, chance virus much 20%. surprised 80%. Yeah, prepare headline repeat. think needs canceled. 10,000 people packed small area smart idea- mask mask. staying home like since started spring! ""Everything's fucked anyway, might well see fucked get!"" Hmmm interesting thanks  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* So... Let's recap cases US NOW... point stores I'm willing go person Asian stores. recently, two stores near people almost wearing masks, couple weeks ago like switch flipped everyone got forward grandma freedom (tm) complete shitshow. Also Netherlands much bigger New York metro area, what's point?  US Ralph Wiggum North America congratulations would bet ends longer-term damage. virus infecting destroying lung tissue - imagine person house fire breathed hot smoke scalded lungs, similar damage, similarly long recovery, potential long-term damage. may ""permanent"" someone goes expect full lung function months without effort rehabilitation. graph telling. 50k rise june slowing yet, wow. style dehumanizing people gotten countless lives killed centuries. Maybe worked style, need uprising. btw? post would say Chinese troll pretending Norway? going say now? Really? 

Funny... Yeah, Belgian lockdown even over. mother told come work, remotely. job office workers unless actually need verify something physically. Need see machine handling new (cheaper) foil. No, operator videotape send samples. never stopped working food industry. floor looks like fucking abstract painting. Dot, cirlcles, squares show people they're allowed stand not. Keeping distance actually enforced god help HR founds walked passed disinfection dispenser without using it. company mandate. masks unless within 1,5 meters someone else. know several nearby everyone wear inside building.

At least people got bored taking advantage automatic 2 weeks sick leaves slightest cough, sneeze bowel movement. hard find time series data broken age, believe we've seen cases elderly fall, otherwise, rest remains pretty well distributed.  Covid &amp; destroying US... chorus Australian media calling China's lock-downs oppressive, totalitarian anti-freedom seems disappeared lol coked-out Toronto mayor? Oh, different guy. Put grass fire need battle bushfire. Lol  think may find useful informative quickly read article, even conclusions, glance charts. Precisely issue raise addressed.

The effort would rewarded. Would guys okay everyone wore mask?  could make nation wide someone living rural north Florida, everyone refuses wear masks go lives usual. middle initial lockdown I'd often see dozens cars outside churches Sundays deemed essential. workplace allow anyone come without mask result 10+ ""you're violating constitutional rights"" meltdowns per day. hell. Actually curious here, position global conspiracy accomplish exactly? Sweden? question established one positive pool won’t diluted give false negative? Divide conquer 🙃 last 10 years? Yep. dude got *pissed* pointed would easier wear mask brushed teeth least two three time week. broad hero. Idk voted.. spot haha Oh fuck w  done like Maryland. 


In Maryland, mandatory. violate order wear mask certain circumstance, guilty misdemeanor 1 year jail $5000 fines, both. 


They ain't playing around. Agreed, Vermont living proof strict lockdowns slowed spread people literally cannot trusted follow temporary minor guidelines benefit everyone obviously grocery store isnt sterile, droplets come somewhere... Yup. Zero products 40 years massive government funding. Nah I’m good. He’s wrong much already. Gotta think right Arizona maskless customer much higher health risk shirtless shoeless customer. You’d think, sadly that’s case.

CoVID19 disproportionately affects poor, people won’t new cars something necessary locomotion goes there’s cash fix it.

A bunch people cars rough shape. real irony people wearing masks affects thier breathing..........what system coronavirus hit hardest again? That’s whole thing vastly overrated. People way worried.

INB4 “tooooo weeeeeks” Unchecked mass spread corona ""good thing"" anyone sufficiently radicalized among protestors. Half people thread vapors people pausing lives lmfao No. know better. Kids taught. FL governor prefers blame kids rather failed administration doesn’t adhere science specialists advices, like king. /u/udntcwatic unskew number us Shhh... G0v T3xa5 shall speak of. US could learn Asia! Tell Arizona record deaths today (and new high 7 day average). Including minor died. fuck anyone that? Click bait answer: fill holes golf courses. continue reading find public, privately owned golf courses. What? Weeks? country day... went last week dentist went took seriously. yes yes please! right supporting scientist, interesting despised people? ppl still learning restaurants want customers wear masks surprised it. intuitive  Well crazy combination.

Lombardy second densely populated region italy one largest population (10 millions second one even reach 6 millions).
In addition economical capital country close central europe. makes travel EU huge.

So already thw worst place outbreak also probable (like NYC).

So old people go hospitals respiratory problems. flu season normal. get tested per procedure.
As virus spreads big hospitals people go (which already strongest ones go hospital get coffee) get exposed get sick. immediately. days after.
Since italy elderly often live families go back home bring virus. winter people likely spend time inside. Offices, schools, bars, restaurants. addition public transportation good thing well developed lombardy.. case really helped spread.

Add fact first western country hit hard, reference except lockdowns china shortage testing kits, masks, ventilators.

I mean that's perfect recipe disaster. another article someone posted listed cities patients transferred. cities Woodlands (I think article called ""Woodlands"", incorrect), Galveston, Conroe, part Houston Metro area. Houston Metro area massive take 2+ hours (with traffic) get one end other. reference, takes 15-20 minutes get Conroe 1.5-2 hours get Galveston (I'm far Northeast side Houston). article slightly misleading patients still ""Houston"", City Houston. However, area hospitals concerning. feel this. I'm starting learn bottom barrel stupidity, keeps going. Virginia. We've indoor mask requirement place weeks people ignoring it, even people supposed enforcing it.

Had go auto shop day one wearing mask except me, including mechanic helped me. supposed point? Scold whole room? call? one. They've explicitly said they're going actually enforce anything.

At community center I'm part of, still pretty strict requirements place, one person per room, sign sheets, indoor mask requirement. We're getting reports people blowing off.

Oh, look that, cases starting rise again. shocker.

It's ""required"" there's actual enforcement. suggestion, everyone choosing ignore. Nobody, reopen make cure worse disease. I'm doctor I'm giving medical advice.

But work hospital coach medical staff. make doctor listen signs symptoms monitoring part coaching plan.

I worried lungs coughing. We've seen extremely mild asymptomatic cases lung changes. can't tell pneumonia based exchange heard cases took months pneumonia develop COVID-19 typical viral pneumonia.

I'm saying happening think worth peace mind afford it.

Sometimes, pneumonia associated blood changes COVID patients experience. wanted make sure blood pressure high common symptom headaches blurred vision.

But sounds like symptoms I'm glad that. ISNT PURELY POLITICAL POST DUMB FUCK Oh, thats' excellent, idea. get one.... join NBA? going see next 2-3 weeks. loved underwear thing...just kinda bit grossed thinking gal said it!

I totally agree indeed hope. fact less wealthy nations better job says doesn’t require lot money technology, people important job titles years post-graduate education, etc.

It simply requires common sense, cooperation consistent effort! follow plan successful. shortcut! exactly situation, I've got spinal injury result regulate body temperature well. started making sure blast AC car full blast/do whatever make sure temperature fever taking kid many appointments week. clue works menopause, works me! Thats doublin' another name cannot say here? know list keywords ridiculous point. restaurant worker, I’m fucking relieved. submitted 7 complaints department health emailed 6 different politicians restaurant violating 40 Covid-19 guidelines. Nothing came it. peak r/Coronavirus exactly cells do. However, response specific. cells attack influenza virus attack influenza virus, one cornonavirus. makes really interesting people haven’t covid-19 producing cell response, happen you’ve covid-19. means you’ve exposed coronaviruses, cause common cold, similar enough covid-19 produce cell response means many people level immunity originally thought. true, good news. US government already reserved first 300 million doses vaccine Here’s unfortunate thing...

From constitutional standpoint, federally mandated ‘shutdown’ would tossed first judge front of. 

State-level actions found constitutional past. Governors power mandate quarantines Trump actually can’t. student history long coming. 

The tipping point reached, scales start swinging wildly regain balance.

&amp;#x200B;

Who think would pass us by? lot gets see results over-extending?

Pride comes fall that. History great teacher right pounding book table screaming ""It's coming...it's right every chapter book tell you! coming!"" class throwing spit balls pictures Dean upset what's lunch menu, almost entirely ignoring her.

Keep head swivel ready anything. KDA Akali mask glow dark Thanks! bad studies bridge gap two groups doctors. Also looks like experiential doctors left reinvent wheel rather draw experience doctors countries. Example: read several news articles doctors ""discovering"" (sequentially, peak hit different epicenters) putting covid patients tummies works better. take alma mater example, UCLA. students are-in cases-not permitted cars due lack parking space. town westwood central hub (the village) students shop, eat, hang out. dining halls absolutely packed hours day massive lines get pick food. want go somewhere else take public transportation. aren’t bars area people party houses, travel nearby cities party. apartments area ridiculously expensive (i paid $4000/month two bedroom) bunch people share small apartments offset cost...i lived 4 guys 2 bedroom. frats sororities crowding. remember getting sick something least quarter extremely healthy time. it’s absolute disaster waiting happen.  link 4 months winter season picks up, antibodies still there? think thats really important Welp that's ironic. exactly schools going open back up. money. kids would fund public schools more.  sir writing today inform allegations im ""idiot"" incorrect. actually ""fucking idiot""

regards,

a fucking idiot Nah, LA surrounding counties. Yes can. Booked ready. essential worker privileges. It’s funny scientist told disparage science though. People love doom. Unfortunately, there's lot people want gather scary stuff use form ""I told so"" others worried are. timeline bud, deaths new infections don’t happen day... give people time die  Coming american, year America deathbed. shoot still 600 people daily foreseeable future. think kill selfish assholes. mean, wanna die, they? Plus keep ICU filled further!

Obviously that's horrible idea, still... Take fucking good enough need restaurant food. need sit restaurant. children job. I’d rather give vegetables watch add years lives free 1 minute today. 

And no, vegetables aren’t average expansive. proved it. Good! Can't tell many people saw LA, without masks, sitting restaurants &amp; social distancing. family households sitting together. even put masks left restaurant. yet peer reviewed worthless. It’s binary lol definitely smile Ford emblem steering wheel. self flagellation form virtue signaling many damn paywalls sub anyone says nice I’ll correct remind I’m sarcastic inappropriate asshole. get compliment I’m trying something could never disappoint No. Stay away disease infested Americans. virus problem control want coming spreading pestilence around. I'm pretty sure stupid enough get jammed plane 6-12 hours anti-mask, virus hoaxer, want nowhere near us! Get shit together America! Cool, open beaches let families gather outdoors Fourth July. know, infrared thermometers may say temperature high oral thermometers normal temp. I’m expert thoufh You’re right thing. Hell, even saved get Cybertruck I’m going find different alternative You’re free assume want. heard impunity saying bot determining civil not, protect identity moderator? Nowhere significant enough learn lesson, apparently. two weeks!!1!! Yes :) used use lot incense. smoke isn’t good skin lungs, switched essential oils diffuser. wife pretty badly, wish worst enemy. best path recovery. Nope, Myrtle Beach basically mayor Jaws cities. could go wrong? Bill Maher great take this. (within reason) whatever want, older people stay home Well, couple weeks. Positive cases risen around 21,000 per day (using 7 day moving average) around 41,000 cases. Deaths dropped 789 581. hope things trending well at. 

I still think function testing done. mean, thank goodness finding tracking cases there, I'm finding hard alarmed deaths still dropping. Six feet apart six feet under. Stop fucking around. Back FULL lockdown, enforce shit teeth. Stop loopholes phases bullshit. never claimed could translate better. 

It implied read post without pushing interpretations onto it, find even say translation bad. 

Oh really? **poor** translations question quality. 

Now telling idea translation ""poor""? say Even translation bad, duty correct it, far know. most, option report mods. 

That's true. So, comment all? seems felt need ""correct"" without actually anything simply jumping attack OP. Why?

Do always join bandwagons without direct knowledge accusations supporting actually true? save threads TenYearsTenDays sorry disappoint, I'm part squad. 

You're sure good impression them... definitely dumb. Hot? Meh. Unsurprisingly area got hit hard first. It’s NYC metro region. right thing containing it. took right measures right amount time. NY NJ CT ones track contain virus rn. states watched happened Italy China Spain, etc., still didn’t learn, they’re needlessly suffering bringing whole country down. Europe banning travel US it’s Northeast. Buddy work asked wanted go drinks tonight. We’re PA beer garden thing outside. go? 🤔 confirm. work university access HR financial data. also degree higher ed administration. Coaches paid tuition. salaries overall Athletics department budget comes ticket sales, merchandising, corporate sponsorships, wealthy fans alumni. Same. Even got money saved Cybertruck now? I’m going start look elsewhere...  “I got covid right Christmas anyway I’m fine” Probably dumb question, kind needles needed vaccine shot? special way? Like hundreds unopened insulin needles switched insulin pump. something like donated use somewhere? bad risk assessment? *different* assessment risk do. make ""bad"" ""wrong"". Perhaps take critical look people work healthcare concerned... kind amazing human could look machine see anything total failure society. fucking massive cells activate presence *specific* antigens. case, 81 percent people covid still cells reacted it, presumably providing *some level* protection. thought people infected other, similar, viruses may level cross immunity.  tic disorder causes mask move around due facial tics. sometimes use hands move back correct position, even dont want to, otherwise let tics move around will. want encourage others aware may reasons dont see others mask worn improperly/people touching masks. always ignorance. really mean 2 weeks deaths go again?  would thought it'd lower participation rate, honest.

I'm 31; one know close enough talk 401ks contributes theirs. There's probably someone comfortable enough life gamble 401k return student loan interest accrue, student loans get cancelled, can't afford prioritize making payments lifetime debt. Protests probably help either. anti masks protests spreading it, right?

Or virus target good causes? Right? I'm talking posted article. No, truth, still prevalent throughout India. That's T-Shirt says! Florida unemployment pays maximum $3,500/month. opted take 10% tax reasons maximum $3,150. $50 less per month bring home now. brought home guess. country needs covid treatment, US 100% needs most. Given people partying, protesting, wearing masks, etc, US desperately needs this. I’m sure countries receive remesdevir vaccine, blame US buying much all. countries handling better socio-economic racial issues lens right now. also president doesnt wear mask. 5G towers? oh, wait, using COVID kill us anyway! /s I'm pessimistic next person, doubt we'll see fatality rates earlier year unless hospital systems start collapse.

We've better job protecting nursing homes vulnerable. better treatments available. prepared general.

Still reason stay vigilant. Even we've managed half fatality rate, place like Texas would see 20,000 additional deaths infection rates reached NYC levels seem acknowledge existence false positives false negatives. Also hospital 0 ICU beds thing make up. certain number beds, certain number people fill them. Suddenly there's many sick people hospitals going capacity divert patients. Hospitals reporting patients physically present hospital reporting someone testing positive virus. make nothing someone testing positive, ends beds. think tackling people outside strapping beds fluff numbers? Cmon man. Sorry intelligent US citizens it’s sort news makes us Europeans crack jokes stupid Americans. No, it’s not. pointing deadline seems school starts. needs sorted long school starts. crisis 4-8 weeks needs resolved now. September. testing people finding positives took 10 seconds lives stupid comment. human rights violation shall highly concerned Texas, US.

I believe soon able buy better eletric car Tesla. Underrated comment hahahahaha Finally politician keeps promises Cuz they're lying ass seemed like far enough date entice emotional response most. ton extra deaths see years can't explained something like nuke falling mid-sized city. 

Note standard practice. know flu numbers year (i.e. 60,000 died flu)? actual, confirmed flu cases never gotten 15k (usually half that) estimate rest based increased deaths overall. That's COVID. Well true. However actually says article ""That afraid accept bite sandwich someone"" implies encouraged sharing food. figured staff helping.

EDITED: edited copy direct quote. rest world going realize America suffers bad decisions they. Instead rejoicing demise understand consequences well.   absolutely false. dentist says brush teeth 3~4 times day, floss daily, still come 2x year routine teeth cleaning. insurance companies know, bc cover teeth cleaning 2x year. argument's even stronger per location basis. conflate young adults kids? Like, millennials kids you? Hexagonal tables 3 people per 100sqft.  


Brilliant person Taiwan health card unique ID doctors hospitals use access online medical records. Providers use card document care episodes reimbursement Ministry Health. result, card gives ministry regular, nearly real-time data physician hospital visits use specific services.  data, ministry modify payments reflect utilization. physicians collectively office visits anticipated ordering MRI scans budgeted, payments per service reduced quarterly reflect overuse. payment-adjustment mechanism allows country adhere annual health care budget return information physicians aggregate individual resource utilization.  Covid-19 hit, health card electronic health records system repurposed fight spread virus.  government merged health card database information immigration customs send physicians alerts patients higher risk Covid-19 based travel history.

Yeah trying glimpse records 48 major surgeries 150 procedures total. Procedures anything bone marrow hip needles, bird hole biopsies. one first caught cured cases remember properly. cholesteatoma seen normal one pretty much cut repair surrounding damaged area. 3 surgeries tops sometimes get two now. mine underlying malignancy made doctors super hard time figuring do. cycled many doctors finally referred man stop fighting matter what. fired surgeons practice refused work due stats amongst truly heroic deeds.

It's really weird media makes us think poor people dumb thing health care employees do.

No one it. Yes dumb even everyone it.

But media goes way hide one group people hate beat poors make difficult, technology. still really know countries/states done low cases fire rn. could pop catch fire anywhere currently know.   Got statistics this? First hearing it. Honestly, think people realize much rich US compared literally every country. Numbers slightly time periods data trivial find, $78k/year puts top 5% earners UK. $90k puts top 5% earners Germany. $166k puts top 5% earners US. Retail store manager US makes salary comparable PhD Chemist UK. talk day problems US has, end day, hell lot worse middle class American. Especially healthy.

Edit: Realized German household two single income, think get gist regardless. mean, they’re least going try get schools running capacity fall. Whether it’s right decision seen then, think nearly every state going level in-person schooling September (but knows whether it’ll get shut again) would never get form transportation Tom Hanks driving Man can't believe CCP would fake numbers like this. knew trouble people waiting line midnight day bars opened back up. maybe people care 2021.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, could ignore patent “compulsory license”, USA also holds countries so.

So countries aren’t US don’t fall generics agreement options:

A Wait Gilead stock available hope USA let Gilead sell 

B Hope Gilead actually allow licensing agreements developing countries agreement

C Allow manufacture “compulsory licensing”, hope figure without Gildead’s help, hope compete needed materials Gilead generic manufacturers, hope US doesn’t retaliate much so

D Buy generics illegally available hope US doesn’t retaliate much. 

And USA decided buy entire supply months. Yes. I'm nurse that's worth. wanted post articles another language I'd use Google translate course*, I'd remove said article became apparent translation incorrect, misled people.

It though. made attempt show translation incorrect misleading. simply declared fact demanded article removed.

So, actually misleading? Hellbucket claims title misleading adequately convey opinion - course, perception. Others may see differently.

For example first word ""believe"" English implies follows opinion... never mind.

The question is, article again, spam post 10 articles within span hour.

Ten posts hour spam. ""spam"" [according Reddit generally defined repeated, unwanted, and/or unsolicited actions, whether automated manual, negatively affect Reddit users, Reddit communities, and/or Reddit itself.

Ten different posts one hour complain gist article same. problem *gist* changed, sometimes is.

Sometimes? way ""gist article"" change here? demonstrate mean?

From Google Translate get ""gist"" staff one care home concerned quality masks provided, fear hesitant come contact patients, may lead patients dying unnecessarily.

Is ""gist"" article? demonstrate better translation would change know trying pin me, sorry, bullshit. know think there's group trying suppress others, know never understand people simply downvote comments bad faith misleading, that's it.

LOL... anyone read posted. simply downvote, make accusations, demand OP remove posts refuse actually address content article.

I ask again... misleading article?

Did staff member care home say thought people died due fear caused mistrust PPE provided? Me. literally asked four guards without masks ordering tacos restaurant picking food. likely explanation: back 5/5, testing like 6/16, might've seen actually 100,000 new cases. talking this? can't find data going back far enough, least far tell 45k, Monday 41k. week many tests? can't find data going back far. think none us truly 2020 vision. Yay potential vaccines all, truly hope remember take shit seriously next go around. ""He spreads misinformation"" 

""How?"" 

""He's obsessed Sweden he's probably bot hurr durr"" 

Thanks reminding I'm Reddit completely dodging question crying bot sure that's entirely true Mr. President different standards counts COVID death. CDC standards states follow, somewhat limited possible (it dying COVID opposed COVID, ambiguous thing ... mileage may vary.) Disingenuous af. 

It’s lowest quality auto brand 2020. It’s lowest initial quality, ranks first 90 days things like cabin noise paint defects. 

The article goes great depth **overall quality** vehicles mechanics highest rated industry. 

But hey let’s keep hating Tesla invent lies overall increase climate change help big oil Musks douchebag. Ok higher cost living 5% income taxes sounds right difference complicated problem pretty well tracked US.

I'm surprised results would appear show fair quality attribution US. Wow, idea could enabled every page. Thanks! Works me. Copy paste? likely be. memory cells last several years. Please resort mirroring. That's even low effort.

Edit: response previous edit edit. 

I would certainly approve circumstances travel restrictions needed. 

I hope get soon.

Considering Swedish infection slow burner phase, might extinguish embers soon enough. LOL, yes I'm hearing one less. doubt it. I’m still anal masks washing though. bf doesn’t seem sick, we’ve kissed “no symptom” weeks 🤷🏽‍♀️ Go Navajo Nation! need kind leadership! mean could be. would expected flatline decrease. Unless takes 4 5 weeks diagnosis reporting. start launching corpses governor's mansion fence? thought positivity rate shot 25%? get life insurance? deaths pneumonia like 300% Totally Covid though, right? good. Large gatherings still unsafe, even you’re outdoors (without masks on) Yeah positive rate isn’t bad compared Arizona Texas. 

We’re looking 8-10% 

Where last saw Texas 24% lot kids fall obese category per BMI agree don’t take flu seriously, way see it, 129k deaths double 56k number, right?

That number around 3-4 months, that’s *with* entire nation shutting down. 129k number could’ve easily WAAAAY higher decided anything. 

Also, vaccine flu, good chunk 56k deaths probably preventable. Covid deaths not. There’s way protect getting it. dumb things people doing? Thanks literal 1 millions. sad higher chance getting struck lightning auto manufacturer Well said Damn hydroxycloraquin thing must pissed right off.

Also existence flat earthers saying ok puts major red flags science background, affront belief system, period. testing them. kids show symptoms mean sick...

Think chicken pox. Get kid, big deal. Get adult, big deal. 

Problem is, since one immunity virus, like chicken pox all. parents going catch kids. Yes, exactly.

The direct impact COVID-19 infection versus corollary effects pandemic response pandemic work directions. know normal numbers people seeking emergency care cardiac issues &amp; stroke way down. That's issues happening. People would gotten treatment died instead. know traffic way traffic deaths. People would died traffic lived. Mental health effects also taken real toll.

It time yet full picture revealed. uncle nurse entire life teased wearing mask funeral month two back I'm copping out.

I'm explaining people dumb things. Even smart ones. 

Anything else hearing projecting. Whoa, friend. Time take time dashboards.  guess possible, probably unlikely. Takes time virus spread unless reason vulnerable people hang together. guess previously underestimated reports infecrions. Combined reasons. I'm sorry, trying parse nonsensical postulating wiping bidets earlier comment.  1h 27m downplays excessive death stats.

you magically get tens thousands people die average numbers deaths time year coincidentally succumb something else pandemic, that's anti science talk right there.

It's coroners putting covid earn money people dying disease.

and musk ""asking questions"" wants car plant open.   us Well, several countries opened schools seen spikes new cases. would try different subreddit question. Ok, us countries?? Everyone else world die long America survives, right? Righto, suspect US one two misteps thrown G7 sanctions imposed.

But hey, go America First middle global pandemic. think close one 802. vote either ask mail ballot. vote next time. Pretty sure Ford helped build railway Well first step stop getting offended. Weight loss calories versus calories out. either eat less increase activity level. We're supposed get mad politicians employers putting us unsafe conditions.

This thing science denying child/adult.

People actually made sport jumping stairs hurts nobody except bail. lucky. I'm rural Ohio would guess even 10% people wearing masks need run I'm even trying go within 30 minutes closing. I'm shocked state seen spike. explanation think combination good contact tracing absolute luck.  know standard states following. Thank you. I've trying tell people similar polio flu. Lower death rate, high rate long term health consequences. Sorry! mean place virus case load increasing rapidly. 
 
Currently county state trending downward cases, hospitalization usage virus 10%. 

This comparison areas cases increasing 50% per day hospitalization usage 80% higher. 

So problem going gym right now, wearing mask, choosing slow time - go gym case counts hospital utilization numbers rising rapidly (or even rising consistently course days). mean, always use debate China. one time payment $1,200 enough lot people. Hell, rent mortgage payment $1,200 per month. work 3 months. state numerous problems unemployment website. got check one week $216, one federal payment $600. receive money rest weeks unemployed. sister law many others received payment two stopped. many people state got unemployment all. optics fine. like US done anything piss allies lately... wait... yep, optics bad usual... Won’t government make free Americans? would think since many nations stated vaccine free nationals. totally isolated seeing anyone. Like kids may contact kids year more? Crazy people charged terrorism. Godzilla plugs erupting super volcano Yellowstone murder hornets. Either works, get murder hornets - fire. infuriating seems, Trump putting show ""America First"" followers. eat - nothing better feel like got need, actually taken all. stopped dirty foreigners getting unclean hands too.

Thing - dexamethasone far better drug cheap chips. Well, Brazil. need anybody else right now. 

But cares third world country, right? countries would given opportunity. works worth gold well what's million 20+ trillion debt trick nursing home aid claiming nurse social media. one ""old school"" bosses thinks work done they're seeing desk. People don’t see news regularly hive mind disregards virus “it’s trending” many degrees separation get tested. Burying head sand, right... Definitely lucky! live city, there’s people everywhere. ""The drug helps coronavirus patients recover quickly manufacturer charging $2,340 per patient treatment""

As really need afford though.  TL;DR (and one **L**): Gotland one Sweden's tourist hotspots. normal years there's tension locals middle class big city tourists 'invade' every year. year due coronavirus pandemic, tension much higher usual residents fear city dwellers bring disease them. wash hands Mr. Rogers. find hard believe college students would admit this..I get would this, would admit it? ""closing""? Closed. Florida calculates daily positive rate bit differently lot states. states ""New positive results / new tests"". 

Florida's data takes account test someone tested last month, count ""new test"". actual daily posivity rate ""new positive results / number people tested yesterday previously tested positive"" 

This produces lower, arguably accurate number. However, bit unfair compare Florida's 15% another states 19%, 19% probably using ""New positive results / new tests"" method. apply method Flordia, get positive rate 18.6% since took 1.5 months see Florida explode opening beginning May, know protests till end next week. Considering NYC suspended indoor dining again, massive spike NYC again, 100% protests, people can't blame bars indoor dining. Pet shop speakeasy...new meaning hair dog guess Yeah, imagine loads kids distance learning. It’s gonna really odd say least. Yep rarely go /x/ anymore. Years ago pretty chill places. There's hope person. tried, must mental deficiency something. got tested got surly National Guard Sargent swabbed me. Felt bad seeing photo. wish pic testing site. 
I’ve swabs several times far back nose child NEVER painful. 2 hr wait time hundreds people getting tested driveway style I’m sure plays part hurt much. Bled bit it’s stopped now. I’m getting tested 15 days. It’s covered health insurance I’ll make appointment primary, hopefully it’ll hurt less there. yess, brain swab appropriate description COVID test. There's LOT bad news, there's majorly bright spots! Check stats Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, others. soothing soul. family New Zealand Vancouver, CA. first options. Vancouver area would nice since it’s similar time zone isolated NZ (since like travel) quality life NZ good well gorgeous country. 

As far countries, Japan always nice (I appreciate culture, big learning curve), somewhere EU like Denmark Norway. happen better country I'm tired ""young adults"" demographic blamed spreading virus. young adult self believes masks social distancing live Georgia. state older adults managers/CEOs think want work times deserve homelessness bad outcomes.

I'm concerned need work among older clientele(rich retirees) wear masks, stay six feet away, think everyone else overreacting. article lists age ranges 25-44. know late 20's friends managers therefore forced go non-remote jobs risk getting covid.

I really would love see virus skews job level range. remote work possible allowed due ""young"" new else young adults do? answer prettt clear....

#Translation:
During corona epidemic, Gotland gone summer vacation destination many Swedes foreigners open conflict zone islanders visitors. 

DN's ex-guru Kristofer Ahlström reports old power relationship new complications.

At party February, ended talking famous woman. heard Gotland, pointed lipstick kissed wine glass said ""No bad thing"", people say offend you, ""but Gotlanders really lazy.""

""Yes,"" hummed softly.

“No one wants job! come Gotland summer never get help. 'We holiday,' say - ever make money? '

In way servants mainlanders, maybe?

I thought aloud, heard.

Never event reality felt clear. woman succeeded shaping exact image many Gotlanders tourists: upper-middle-class nannies see local residents serfs, constantly stand-by fulfill demands quality life. Cut hair! Fix bike! Paint fence! Even vacation time!

It difficult power relationship. one third companies island, large number private individuals, dependent hospitality industry.

But tourism become vital Gotland's economy future tax power - important ever corona crisis - agreement comes business language called caveat , hook. clause paraphrases old Hassan sketch happens join EU, replace invasion ten thousand German gays hundreds thousands coughing Stockholmers.

Joking aside. clear Swedish National Board Health's calculations quarter Gotlanders, due illness old age, risk group covid-19. 

**So far, island fairly spared corona spread, happens crowds multiply months, free spaces become fewer, nightclubs, alleys barges riddled drunken tourists? holiday tranquility distorted single major worry.**

● ● ●
Already spring, travel restrictions eased, situation infected. Would infectious Stockholmers defy Public Health Authority's request, follow habitual flock behavior travel Gotland Easter? heaven Christ? National Day weekend? 


The Gotland boat's fairway became immediate line conflict. formed island Facebook groups, miniature communities miniature. Members asked report saw mainlanders still ventured island. reading eyewitness accounts type, ""I saw people taking selfies front Österport, clearly permanent residents so"". Attempts made request passenger lists boats Nynäshamn Visby match travelers registered ritten island. least fragile anecdote route, told Gotlanders showed garden seasonal residents explain desirable island. 


It's horrible behavior, totally reprehensible. (If true.)

And fully understand that. (If I'm allowed little development, just.)

IPO Enquist's autobiography ""Another Life"" describes author seeks Swedes emigrated Argentina's jungles form colony there. meets them, want talk like Sweden right now. “What like live exile? exile, dreams abandoned country strong,” Enquist concludes.

You settle Argentina feel way. feel way. peasant sits hard me; landscape - scents deeply ingrained flesh memory that, matter am, evoke them. principle closeness, one care one front eyes, bite slightest: read Helagotland.se often local section Stockholm newspapers. identify strongly Gotlanders twenty miles eighteen years away lived there. Tells ""go home"" take ferry there. reacted Gotland instinctively read interior report influencer's Gotland house - got picture family posed picturesque barefoot dirt road wanted rinse eyeballs T-red. 

It usually said distinctive region - genuine nature dialect appear - attractive becomes well-ordered middle class. inclined one becomes embrace one's own. tension everyone wants authentic themselves. example, one replicas local magazines' submission pages, exilgute denotes home affinity arguments ""I know body cakes are, I've gotten drunk Gotland drink"". 

Such radicalization go right fast: Stockholmers acquaintance who, summers Gotland, scornfully despise tourists build towers pebbles ""their"" shorelines. 

People tend form clusters draw boundaries around them. Perhaps one social aftereffects pandemic: much harder guard borders - allow Swedes go Finland, also personal spheres fortified. social distance becomes antisocial. Increased suspicion alien. 
Perhaps already buried somewhere Gotland's heritage: anthropologists usually say old peasant societies basic skepticism rests rootless people, travel around land site. want put evidence dad usually sits kitchen window comment passes outside do, but, yes, that.

● ● ●

When news came routes Gotland opened, rushed single big Finally local newspaper's Facebook page read residents' reactions. disappointed. article pictured happy smile Stefan Löfven hammock hands clasped behind neck. could really hear happy sigh let go - puh, conflict finally over! ""woke"" line flu kills people color every year forget coronavirus focus something matters.

If federal government actually job back February, may still true year. Lol. 1918 bad wave July. Everyone figured flus happen summer. Yeh us choice. Everyone same

Seems point part time others full time? segregated Federal Government teenaged TikTok stars intel held level accountability?

Ultimately buck stops white house, certainly. time, pleading people worked public health departments social justice activists take seriously, got marching orders downplay independent white house messaging. remember correctly, Spain, infection leaked 2-3 weeks super strict lockdown. Must defence bot. Exactly response multiple threads It’s bad looks. mean, wouldn’t wish upon worst enemy, still tell people covid want spread here. live Spain too. week late agree, feel managed well overall.

Edit, removed word. also forgot Trump waging war Twitter via EO midst lol. SMH tried get test inland empire? San Bernardino county booked til July 6th hit 796 positive 3000non Tuesday. border cities LA county similar state. Riverside county almost full capacity ICU including surge San Bernardino filling quick. decent hospitals also 2 million people sb 2.5 million riverside. plans close “bars” gets bad. grim picture. low testing county numbers won’t reach alarming status. im saying double testing capacity numbers would among worst nation. time slightest bit good news, even true, stock market jumps

today's example...  Ok. Well go wear cotton mask go America fun.
Your previous comment enough. admit Americans idiots anyways much winning freedom fact reporting completed course rabies shots yesterday notice fever.. oh pat angry stray cats like doctor public health official warned us stay away Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville months Nice I’ve wearing handkerchief made 100 percent cotton folded twice over. washed dozens times stronger paper masks. [Not new situation states simply care health money stake. Finally I'll valid excuse sex ever catch virus. Yes sold stock Herd immunity 70-85% FYI. don’t disagree comment overall people throwing around “herd immunity” like it’s magic bullet something that’s easily obtainable.  kids transmitting adults, everyone wearing masks, teachers wear face shields addition masks, ample handwashing/ hand sanitizer, risks adults getting low. also idea long term effects virus Science denying pretty bold claim someone whose company helped send people space American soil first time nearly decade.

Do information claim that? Stop trying justify loopholes (especially broad audience), especially you’re front line. 

There one way safely wear mask: correct way. Every time.

Some people also avoid wearing seatbelts wrinkles clothes. excuses justifications endless. Millennials well-adjusted disaster. keep heads play safe. many deaths take Americans take seriously Science medicine always related.

They intrinsically linked dolt. fucking terrifying know alleged nurse running around working kind understanding profession.  colleges completed insulated way spread surrounding community... YES $962 ENDS JULY 31ST.. kind whole point post, imbecile. 

And hobby- calling rich jerks internet enjoy belittling people. Someone set GoFundMe. hope helps her. I’ll never understand gun fetish. likely 50% capacity 2 days week school 3 days home 

Bay Area   New Yorker here... Good. We're ready that. There's critical need indoor dining. keep slow make sure things stable safe. Amen. *Now good little children wear mask kids"" It’s lethal enough young people something drastic enough postpone education. Taking year consequences lot reasons testing numbers lower, nefarious. rule government fuckery, also consider fact tests counted processed. would unusual tests held due lack processing materials, example. wife hospital doctor observed problem time time. tell anecdotally test *collection* definitely slowed down, accelerating area.

I also surprised DOH trying massage data, e.g. big spike report fraction cases retroactively report rest day less reported. trust career people DOH follow law report public health information, I'm sure might bend rules pressure Governors office. HPV vaccine chronic pain seems take bit longer develop. upside crippling loneliness problem. Wow. Resorting spellcheck. Great comeback Here's better CA hospital bed side IMO - data clearer. ICU bed usage started rising 2 weeks ago rise deaths yet. Yup.

Our elected officials tax us spend money making donors wealthier bombing children.

Meanwhile, nurses using trash bags we're sent work wills opposition public safety. People smoke even though know cancer risk. obese even though know heart disease/stroke/etc. bungee jump free climb. babies. eat holes wall. unprotected sex relative strangers.

We're always calculating risk calculating present vs. future. many figure even live clean right, could still get hit driver, get cancer, whatever.

So get way people feel. needs happen become socially unacceptable wear masks show non-essential events. People tend care people think.  Nope link official English translations / summaries Swedish pressers first. link countries. know can't though since we've road times. 

And new report Swedish medical journal says everything badly Sweden failed new strategy covid-19 repeatedly criticized targeting homogeneous majority society [4]. **The authorities' language methods communication criticized unclear Swedish mother tongue accustomed type communication.** Furthermore, clearly taken account actual possibilities social distance equal everyone.

So yeah, that's Sweden's biggest medical journal yet still like pretend problem. bother people power follow rules impose people govern? impartiality mean anything you? Every day understand little Brazil India Russia members BRICS. 

We exactly same, speak different languages. stupid. read title there's need read fucking paper. basically say hey could link, someone investigate it. waste time. Yep, there's difference stupidity vs ignorance. People educational levels stupid. lower educational level, higher probably ignorant topic.

You fix ignorance, can't help ignorant million topics. can't experts everything.

Stupidity flat refusing ignorance, unfortunately habit fixable. people wear masks. kind sad funny supposedly ""greatest"" country earth, global superpower seen benchmark failure. happen every single campus that's open. Guaranteed. information given press conference found written form.

Here listen summaries different bars, many businesses still open. 

This well, states like TX not. Apparently, Texas Arizona packed bars, restaurants, nightclubs early-mid June. Lynn Lynn city sin never come way came in.  Yes. great news means likely safe. Efficacy next question. [This well detail Malaysia's response pandemic though mainly terms healthcare. One important part timely implementation [Movement Control (MCO), nationwide lockdown police military enforcement Malaysians largely obedient to. Yeah like what. things sub little exaggerated 0.26 IFR speculative one many models CDC has. 0.5-1.0% we're probably looking at. 

No one asking anyone completely pause life anymore. smart wearing mask figure vaccine. Science medicine always related.
So maybe probably think that.
Because sounds like missed lot classes also Hmm.... Maybe like people protesting ""haircuts""... Yeah shitty remember saying thing weeks ago getting downvoted hell it. I'm glad see folks coming around point. Stabby bottle-ly. upset people (off top head) indoors groups 6 large 2 households outdoors groups still 6 large upto 6 households, name contact details need given, places insisting pre-booking tables.

Recipe (drunk) upset people. Ah yes. love people can’t inconvenienced. people tend ignore fact ventilator grandma’s funeral way inconvenient mask. shaved beautiful 8” beard could wear mask go back work. read Gus Clark Guy Clark said “Hell yeah!” people care think. Except coronavirus deaths (you know, what's **actually important**). fact, Italy 14 times deaths Texas does. even close big problem Texas. agree, kids' infections ""mild asymptomatic."" However, concern long-term affects coronavirus. example, Chicken Pox virus cause shingles adults (many years initial infection). yes, children present day likely bad affects, know happen 10, 20, 30, 40 years road. $0.02.  People forget (or choose ignore it) far often. see bozos Facebook saying things absolutes people believe like it’s science. 

Like maybe believe sheets won’t work well something else, it’s better nothing. we’re learning might better thought. massive portion world population gonna end immunocompromised features could dangerous everyone. Europe can’t buy licensees, along lot countries. Gilead. 

The point remains asshole move US’s part buy supply Gilead time.

The US known strong-arm US countries sending supplies countries. Inovio Moderna releasing preliminary data fully expecting Pfizer follow suit. Glad wrong. Well, saw trips all-inclusive resorts Cancun went something like $2500 less $500. Can't say blame someone buying those. difference :P Yea...this hot take. I’m sure would want front line emergency worker know difference you’re (At least twice thread), know studies prove efficacy masks, making wild claims cotton masks killing you? yea I’m sure you’re emergency worker. Sorry I’ve got work spaceship I’m president NASA! Isn’t internet fun?! fair, getting laughed 3 years covid 19. bears noting franchisee store owner this, definitely make corporate aware. link thread connects directly means so. forget strange uptick pneumonia deaths see mentioned.  suggesting true many cases tell woman infected salon? one customers? Don’t major side effects actually occur timeframe usually actually (towards beginning) people money stock market tho? I'm different tech company I'd amazed see anyone open office back 2021 rate. risks greatly outweigh rewards company virtual interim probably stay way. Local communities deserve investigative journalists, too.  August September hopefully kind baseless ad hominem attack part pattern targeted harassment perpetrate deserves answer this. dont think get it.
You value goats life humans.
You would rather test 50 goats population whatever slum town hope saving people could save people instead. fever actually means vaccine working really well. body responding making antibodies way actual virus. get rabies shots last year (LONG story) fever one doctor told me. Consider sources whether something gain telling you. Journalists paid clicks commercials. might feel altruistic duty report truth. don't. take step back think GENERAL less access high quality dental care? 

Low income households minorities. oral hygiene isn’t link, it’s income access quality healthcare. Oof Cool, lose business forever 👌 Someone deprogram Florida woman. love everything except thoughts ideas. Makes perfect sense. related Fox News shows likewise prominent source family members mine, too. Meanwhile told PBS liberal sockpuppet. workplace opens next week. took opening day I’m ready argue people day get screamed at. come back customer tries give problems, I’m walking away helping them. don’t care. don’t get paid enough deal garbage. Wait, says that? last sentence. difficult get customers social distance past 10 PM. responsible fucking business owner close dinner 10 PM. sympathy shitty business owners. number deaths due cause **increased approximately 122 000 March 1 May 30, 2020**, **28% higher reported number COVID-19 deaths.** decide whether send sixteen year old back school Orange Country, CA , begins August 18th. chose 50% campus, 50% online schedule option her. Masks optional Schools, way Gov Newsom wrote mask ordinance. first I’ve heard large number children testing positive...time rethink sending kiddo back campus. also caregivers elderly mother....Ugh. better PPFree Depends wins election. want see handled better been, know vote for. respect Musk rat? numbers reported publically Texas seriously alarm point simply understand mean. sleepwalking tragedy right now- memory lasts 3 weeks forget lessons already learned. captain im reading increasing levels dumbass every post, shall proceed? think people still going put blame protesters spike. Certainly good hear though. get leaders deserve. ☹️ Louisiana resident Jefferson Parish.(one original hot spots). noted got slammed late March early April. local residents actually took quite seriously governor quicker act cautious re-opening. led swift decline cases hospitalizations.

Then would say three things happened. First lot state affected. caused lot politicians parishes affected really push governor reopen fast possible. immense pressure politicians pointed Texas Florida states successful reopening.

Second, people lockdowns. time went people craved social interaction normalcy started reopen almost immediately went back life normal. Couple fact it’s 90° outside 90% humidity lot people chose socialize inside.

Last numbers skewed little bit probably compared outbreaks. majority cases ages 20 39. older generations still taking quite seriously. think keep saying “you make difference “ isn’t much Fauci anyone do. It’s impossible contain point. doesn’t matter point let’s shift blame people. Look California, policies super strict it’s getting control still find hard believe it’s knuckle heads wearing mask bar. It’s becoming impossible contain. Dude try decaf? small joke. 

Apparently small. doesn’t take science degree see “higher infections=bad” part thinks schools already know able go back, waiting last minute get pushback parents. 

Another part thinks schools going try go back regardless, waiting last minute get pushback teachers (and parents) true. Oh forgot writing articles NBC, lemme reach editor crazy man. live too, colorado.

My dad used go museums together time. love science. bedrock beliefs.

It used too. He's Fox News addict, decades. argument couple weeks ago politics. told believe science, bullshit coming politician.

He said: ""There scientists America more. They've bought paid for"". talked since. guess? important mask hand go case run people need go inside somewhere, near people making much difference without mask.

Also longer wearing mask, get contaminated lose effectiveness, unless really good rotating cleaning could making worse overusing one. Get ready headline every couple days create accreditation board get certified ophthalmologist meet official board's qualifications money maker. Generally speaking ERs, psych, inpatient units operate loss. There's reason EMTALA exists - ERs L&amp;D lose much money. Honestly think hospitals make much money people think. healthcare system broken - hospitals near bottom totem pole. for-profit, publicly traded hospital systems like HCA deserve tremendous amount scrutiny, though. Hmm. Well you’re standing. faster people get infected faster reach peak.

Yeah. people die way, people wanna act dumb that’s whats gonna end happening. 

I would keep away much could people keep loved ones informed


Only thing sucks people actually listened tried keep safe, idiots idiots end catching it. feel bad them. Source speculation? think governors want lockdown July 4 holidays sake. Home dumb 10% Boston results came (lower overall MA), data likely date point. guess LA 3-7%? thought higher, maybe mistaken. .25 65's, know what's IFR people 65? find odd stick science, condone one risky behaviour, encourage another.

The Jesus question simple yes no, doubt productive civil conversation follow. It’s going really hard get re-elected types things get leaked often Probably since can't travel lol. ...i want really want ship. yeah, agree. 50% Americans stock (although many people 401k's try access money pay rent pay large penalties). 

But I'm pretty sure understand trying say. think page now. nice day. Unfortunately seems like looked stock market projections based Covid hit people started get sick, potential solution save market ""hoax"" virus away. forget tethered ""success"" presidency well stock market year COVID tanked it.

Doing sensible thing would've killed market, want that. BPA bottles banned U.S. next risk instant noodles styrofoam cups say ""don't microwave"" tiny print nobody read it. fill mine water, dump noodles water 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup microwave (the Pyrex glass measuring cup).  1.5 minutes high (to get water hot first), 6 minutes 30% power (to keep boiling over). go something else come back 8 minutes. comment replying makes sense misunderstood - else would anything herd immunity? maybe read good chains great takeout afford lose restaurants.

Community owned ones dont luxary. think relative mine's precise motivation understand. still lower quoted numbers. going confirmed cases CFR got propagandized evil foreign ~~media~~ **Reddit Poster** think Sweden's ""playing poker death"" strategy ""playing poker death"" strategy! 

*""Tune tomorrow, folks next ten daily updates Sweden's Death Strategy.""* Logic?? What’s wrong you?? read quoted.

If antibodies anything, would countless examples people reinfected. none; every example false positive. considered might wearing masks killing virus?

Nobody wore makes coronavirus people start wearing masks death rate increases.

Killer masks, 'nuff said.

/S ""it's science anecdotal evidence."" Lol I'd say so. Georgia 1385 *pneumonia* deaths year average 2009-2018 year got 2525 Feb 1 Jun 1. Really wish peer reviewed large group used. mean, called needle post replied you’re going nitpick needle vs syringe? 

And don’t prefilled. Stick jar septum fill top, get bunch doses one jar. that’s normal, make exception emergency situation. 

I’m surprised aren’t saying sharps containers next hold wet can’t make enough. alcohol swabs. bandaids. paper pull seat sit exam room. wipe ass Corona-covered paper, go ahead, since that's apparently high standard you... especially embodiment pure evil like Fuck article, travel work people wearing masks purposefully wearing masks incorrectly older folks. Wife drive testing Seattle 2 weeks ago results back less 24 hours. Thanks, worried America would impacted used uber monday - plastic ""wall"" (with uber logo, guess supplied them) behind front seats separated driver. Nice safe. company offered 401k laughed read it. I’d better leaving money checking account collecting .2% interest whatever rest life. CDC waves coming. never trust single data points. 1st LA county serosurvey 4% positivity rate, plummeted 2.1% month later. Clearly one numbers wrong. close 10K. kidding. We're midst issue severely affecting pretty much every American best time take break?

Benefits ending 31st, earlier states, even reconvene 17th? need MASSIVE changes way handle bunch things, I'm sick shit. real. want proud country, fucking shit big time. multiple levels. Maybe government shit leg initially minimizing danger, lying efficacy wearing mask.... Works 20 hours day? old little boy? fuck dumb enough believe this?

Please let know Elon manages shit, piss, wipe arse, shower, eat, brush teeth, get dressed, shave post moronic garbage Twitter four hours? Idiot. Quit spreading bullshit, probably worked day life, naive bum. Absence evidence evidence absence. documented cases directly tied protests, sane epidemiologist would swear that: ""No one got sick result participating protests."" Politifact said looking rates misleading point deaths multiple causes. 

Was chasing around 11 month old typed stuff incorrectly initially. think better estimate deaths multiple causes point let additional pneumonia deaths floor additional pneumonia deaths plus reported covid ceiling Truth baby! 2x World War champs!! Politicians give shit experts. shitty. care $$$, favors reelections.

I wonder bring body bag meeting gift them? death threat. gift, case need it. Surely it’s back lockdown time? No, I'm saying mods called threads several times, every single time one anti-TenYearsTenDays crowd gets rule-breaking comment deleted.

The posts stand matter many times guys complain, rest us see TenYearsTenDays broken rules posts. ordeal people needing cars. sell cars people need them, uhh 1 outta 60? used cars. people AZ trading 2018s 2019s 2020s exotic cars Either calling fake news redirecting attention away. live society cannot good adequate public transit 1). poors closer. 2). Auto lobbyists would sad.

We know cannot fight climate change without it. unsustainable.

Your grandmother would probably encountered Karen high speed rail.

Karen really awful shame face consequences family robbed justice, though. hope forced live did, though. 

She known better.

How's grandma? didn’t even notice it’s cake day. I’ll take it. Quite likely. would love agree.... but....what help fix America? Coronavirus exposed every single flaw society. People love yell ""I vote 45. people's fault."" Bullshit. knock doors inform others? volunteer time swing states keep reality tv star office? one fucking thing stop madness? Neither I. fault. pass get opponent Hillary. 2 pieces shit choose from. lobby congress access legitimate third party candidates? Neither I. part problem. selfish assholes way. must never make mistake again. inactions set country back decades. people dont realize beginning disaster. We, people, ourselves. Now, people must begin long, painful process correcting unforgivable mistakes. uncomfortable think, figure someone like guy could tell follower anything believe it. live Texas really, unnerving, people live here.  see risk willing accept. city median death age 84, death rate age bracket something like 0.1% believe. Long term effects unknown. Mental health stress however things already see happening many friends/coworkers, balance two risk fine me. may you. mean I'm careless though, still try avoid rarely big group people, thing going anywhere want resume sort normalcy going completely crazy. think buying modern house would cost efficient, yes, live good school district, thats prompts extreme makeovers. also indian families tend stick together, uncommon 2, 3, even 4 generations one roof. kind eye sore seeing mini taj mahal street full ranch style houses.

it's funny, HVAC tech couple years, old ladies get upset 100 year old unit keeps breaking down, old house. They're similar boat. studies show X taking seriously generations. This, believe NY cases dropped spread throughout entirety stare. 417k cases detected x10 factor cdc recently published 10x many cases could exist =4.17mm cases population 8mm people. spend lot time Europe Canada days. It’s nice see things opening back there. Hopefully US follows suit, although eat delicious Ribeye sipping T&amp;T courtyard downtown Philly. yeah, enjoy it. 
 
See BC next week! :) soon wishing still &lt;10k/day lockdown people allowed even leave homes...good luck AZ  oh they;ll get touched... theyre vandalized USA fast tracking method. 1300 students 150 adults one roof open windows. still can’t buy Lysol wipes! (I find sanitizer least) Yeah you’re supposed minimize amount time you’re wearing mask (as spend long place would need mask, go in, know want get quickly) chance hell. Full stop. Dozens college athletes tested positive, pros already tested positive, happening. Maybe watching small town softball team possibility. prefer [Home  America!!!! Suck dick president get fuck traitor! bad idea. early pneumonia symptoms? occasional headaches yes, bp eyesight issues though. also navy seal served Korea killed Bin Laden experts already studied false negative false positive rate. Spoiler alert: it’s wave. Here’s one big problems:

I’m med school classmates constantly make jokes stupid things see. We’ve gotten feedback standard patients time time patients refuse follow advice make fun preach opposed educating something important. One things I’ve noticed everyone ignoring policy “they’re dumb”, don’t know. you’re constantly ridiculed stupid, you’ll become obnoxious tell people eff want. 

I’m surprised isn’t national campaign promote education masks. Japan, signs everywhere teaching people properly wear mask. Instead condescending, educate others! understand people set ways enforcement absolutely necessary, truly believe that’s many people aren’t they’re supposed doing. Well buy shit paper 5 weeks, image protein. might happen. dont think so. Smithfield actually owned China. Here's little sure find many want Google. curious, I'm envious country people willingly traveling Sweden. This. rewards people still working. takes care everyone cannot work (except people top economical pyramid scheme, happening) know view contradictory information loophole. new data processed, new methods emerge. disagree findings, disagreement based hunch, something read, recent interview, different study? basing opinion info circa February 2020?

Asking someone source opinion extremely reasonable. UK, schools open essential workers throughout lockdown. average, 3 outbreaks (2+ cases location) per week schools time. 

Schools reopened weeks ago kids. Week last, 34 outbreaks. Schools tail behind nursing homes total weekly number outbreaks now.

This information found government documents, reason widely reported media discussed politicians. boils blood Obviously. plan give free masks native people regularly abuse murder? canada cool (in minds) grew here, everywhere. used prevalent.

It still occur though. Comparing day week time always puts perspective me. get numb daily numbers otherwise. That's crazy. Like “magic” Wearing mask inside car stupid unless uber driver. Can't understand wear one safety car. Yup me. Bartender forced back work Memorial Day southern state serve mostly middle aged people far. (There also young 20s old people too, majority middle aged) Cant refuse work lose unemployment. discouraging life general one gives fuck us. I’m giving examples people still refuse follow instructions even health depended it. example immediate forced lifestyle change yet people refuse follow it. I’m sure figured people wouldn’t click article phosphorylation profiles, haha.

Here’s article: 
 Fixed link format, sorry* Plague rat! That’s interesting. didn’t think way. think 20% positivity rate kids. 

I lucky, school really great job virtual learning - elementary school huge - 1300 students. gave 1200 devices students missed 5 extra days school, assisted families interpreters get free internet home (we title low income, high immigrant community). participation 90% range students grade level weekly intervention (guided reading oral language development) teachers live. groups went 60-90 minutes cause kids wanted read “one book”. bump reading levels informally (we assessing). class live morning meeting social emotional development continued. teaching new content, able get review games engagement strategies down. It’s never ideal told model schools. still saw tons stuff could build of. say give hope families didn’t experience. get better ends going back. 

It stresssful time teaching career, don’t get wrong. want go back heart, go back point. Pretty much intrinsic rewards teaching stripped format. One year retrospect isn’t much sacrifice get control. teacher wants stay home it’s easier better way teach. It’s survive pandemic. It’s safe us community large.

God, could imagine knowing family it, sent school sick, teacher gets sick never returns???

No one building 1300 students 150 adults one roof open windows. FL teachers make anything close salary someone get exposure. one coming risk substitute teach $$ offer. people blaming millennials millennials. vast majority hospitals pubicly traded pretty sure knows Thanks. did. don’t. social media feed filled brim people celebrating 4th July already gathering together en mass without masks. It’s going bloodbath July Texas specifically okanagan prime canada Suggestion: unusual eyeliner.

I big make-up wearer like spend ton time it, sometimes want bright pop funky lipstick give.

When get bug wear something interesting, weird-colored eyeliner good mask-friendly alternative. Nyx cheap liquid eyeliner range comes everything red olive green. deaths lagging, lying number deaths. attribute Corona something else used cause death. Yeah, never seen fearless group people. Really Home Brave. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Bought masks Hanes, know cotton. Looks kinda weird wearing underpants face. keeps hurts he’s surprised pikachu face I’m like “well think would happen?! warned?!”

Everyone favor watch speech [Normalization Study it. Memorize it. sounds rather dry, actually compelling. 

Every time lower standards bend rules without consequences, develop mental feedback loop tells you... *Maybe okay, maybe rules nothing. all, broke came end without scratch!*

Then continue bend rules fact playing fire inevitably burn comes complete surprise, despite fact literally everyone knows fire hot. Oh wow, that’s much one day.. narrative pushed solely justify re-opening schools, kids ones building.

As parent teacher, totally understand frustrating options be, schools constantly expected less. would use great example everything wrong education system. rest world won’t forget this. honesty, I'd like see second independent study pretty spectacular numbers.

Hopefully someone examining one false positive. Another coronavirus? close relative COVID circulating 2018? Mystery? I'd like know. We've doubled testing since samples collected positivity rates plummeted. multiplier known cases actual cases probably closer 5X 10X right now. rate cases currently growing, gottlieb might right week two. small city, article newspaper they’re going discuss giving raises mayor city council. botched response whole situation. mayor still won’t require masks even though surrounding cities county done so. imagine lack non-emergency health screenings also going providing serious issues longer term well. many people going prostate exams mammograms result, might see cancer diagnoses pushed late many cases. Smart amount policy convince people act collective good, healthcare workers see consequences COVID-19 firsthand take risks seriously?  think quoted thing wanted quote. Haha, walking yesterday, saw family four exit subway station yesterday without evidence masks persons. Oof that's dawg got mine done back early may quest told week. Took Thursday. results Tuesday morning. Yikes. Ok that’s bad. Hope people know better. Look photos. wearing fancy masks. ones cover mouth. Perhaps specific? believe meant owned sense China huge customer influence direction business.   Yes, really outdoors risk infection transmission WAY lower. Closing indoor bars seems like reasonable measure would still allow good measure economic activity. ""all none"" middle ground apparent I'm outgoing, like mask hides smile want see shitty facial hair need fix. worry others think comic outright says Biden advoates it, one. fucking late. bunch idiocy. pandemic long fucking time go. Even late start plants. wave Siths deal absolutes. Uh huh. ER doc love people like you. Steady cash flow.

And love whining

 "" ankle wrist going casts 6 weeks"". ""But work like that, tend bar?"" "" don't"". Texas reopened increasing cases refusing lockdown... Multiple vaccines already mass produced actually. hope least one prove safe effective, people start using right away. yes, good news. obviously can’t read. pretty much  confirm. live western Wisconsin, \~80% high risk locations (places covid positive people visited) listed county health department website bars. Car dealerships necessary, transportation necessary.

That mean every individual car purchase necessary. business needs remain open. Closing would create terrible hardship people actually need cars. 

If like analogies, think grocery store. essential stay open, important people buy food. mean every candy bar Pepsi purchase pandemic ""essential."" business must remain open, even people make foolish non-essential purchases it. bought Solarcity bonds Spacex money. whole fraud pyramid going collapse didn’t bail solarcity antibodies test normal virus swab test? got results 15 minutes Atlanta GA Tech campus. incredibly streamlined operation, unfortunate hear it’s across country He's Stupid. I'll NEVER buy Tesla. Mom, daughter brother risk. People like ... can't say forum. Remind me! 4 weeks frequently wear masks self shop see others too. yet experience much raised eyebrow anyone else.

I live Gothenburg. LMAO. Someone Backwoods Corner, Arkansas still feeling world's hatred toward us. game everybody could get piece pie... seem incapable internalising information. kinda funny dude bothers respond you.

Even refuse acknowledge wrote.

Very curious behaviour. Yep imagine lots lock downs shelter place whatever want call coming holiday weekend. thought first in-depth look last weekend. 100% commingled.

Look tab 5 Question, cross threads? in, would added benefot say 2 3 layers cloth rotated 45 degrees next (1st - 0°, 2nd - 45°, 3rd - 90°)? that? 

I hear sound virus cheering Same. weird one person sway opinion entire company, looks like company whole problem has, I've never close owning one cars, home batteries really interesting  correct. Autocomplete bane existence. Everyone gets turn. That’s pandemics work. spike up, drops reopen. You’re rest world April. benefit effective treatments much research accurate modeling. It’s going ok. Shit, country (Chile) getting 25% positivity rate past 2 months guess lockdown last forever. We're fucked up. actually opposite, attributing nearly enough deaths covid. death rates low, blatant lies number deaths. publishing covid pneumonia deaths see real picture. Umm, Texas skyrocketing Lt Governor told people stop listening Dr. Fauci experts. won’t go back all, increasing Oh hell. creep!!! totally forgot him. think heat sunlight probably matter, problems factors wouldn’t relevant indoors That's really terrifying.

You referral pulmonary specialist examine lungs. I'm worried pneumonia.

Any headaches? blood pressure issues? Eyesight issues? ""To infinity beyond!"" really wish got nothing job like US senator president, instead I’m engineer working 6-4 haven’t single day coronavirus. would want go trouble fixing someone else's mistakes, avoided begin with?

Oh, know... ADD value conversation?

The article exists. seen dispute content article, clearly value conversation. question translation. post better one.

Everyone wins.

Unless course really trying prevent information posted. case whining translation bother articles butchered translation 

Butchered say? Prove it. know... perhaps post better translation rest us take word it?

But want to, know gist article want rest us pointing is.

You'd rather leave vague accusations translation ""butchered"" demand removed. locked today would expect least 3 weeks increasing hospitalizations Texas numbers stabilize. Look back 3 weeks Houston's hospitalizations start line, plot now, follow line 3 weeks now. 

That projected number truly terrifying exceedingly plausible. did, again. actually back normal weekly average mortality rates US year year average based 2014-2017 cdc death rates. mention “taking Tesla private” securities fraud suggests people either natural immunity - likely previous coronas - or, C-19 half infectuous led believe. 

In either case, least 20 times less dangerous led believe back March. Thank you.  idea. assumption since lot stubborn I’d prefer fair reasonable (and yes laughing hysterically term considered USA lately). 

They fucked lot countries cannot buy generic due Gilead licensing buy Gilead (which obviously can’t either). 

And generic isn’t even available yet everywhere except US looking current stock remdesivir thinking “how long last?”

The US afraid strong-arm companies sending supplies countries, even countries fair sharing resources (like materials manufacture meds, trial vaccines). people spread corona rich poor.

The poor choice work essential occupations (sanitation, healthcare, elder care, infant care, grocery stores, pharmacies, food delivery, food processing, agriculture). choice live overcrowded housing, 7 family members also minimum wage essential jobs.

But rich ones excuse. Carmela Montou Uruguayan fashion designer exposed 700 people corona attended wedding getting back trip Italy. Patient Zero Westchester county, NY lawyer got back Italy spread corona wife, kids, neighbor. Rich people New York Chile spread virus flee city residences country estates beach villas. F*** rich people like Taylor Bronczek. May get sued stone age sell Manolo Blahniks Hermes bags. Thanks leaving Facebook. Promise glad concern doordash idk i'd break even. car guzzles gas like nobody's business. I’m going keep small circle friends keep that, allowing small gatherings numbers go little. Restaurants, bars, parties/big gatherings probably table probably around summer 2021 vaccine treatment available.  bit jest regards taking lift mountain :p That's good hear think deaths coming. US getting super scary. Dr Fauci said see 100 000 new cases PER DAY 5 million dead said done real possibility treatment drug, vaccine really matter case. me, every day, talking neighbors. “mild” case back March lingering side effects. It’s awful, people think it’s joke since “only old people die”. 80% deaths immediate, covid take extra.

The ""I'm dumb prove wrong"" troll routine pretty boring honest. better that.  addition travel ban wont allow travel first place?! study *not* conclude protestors group see uptick COVID infections. concluded protests likely caused non-protestors social distance staying home, etc. conclusion *net* social distancing effect upon studied geographic areas positive.

That means could be, time, COVID uptick among protestors, masked less COVID among Conclusion:  almost certain protests caused decrease social distancing behavior among protest attendees, demonstrate effect protests social distancing behavior entire population residing counties large urban protests *positive*. Likewise, possible protests caused increase spread COVID-19 among attended protests, demonstrate protests little effect spread COVID- 19 entire population counties protests three weeks following protest onset. cases, estimated longer-run effect (post-21 days) negative, although statistically distinguishable zero.^(20)  results necessarily extrapolate imply large outdoor gatherings per se safe. case protests study, compensatory behavioral responses among non-participating subpopulation appear driving net effects find overall population. makes absolutely sense Texas 7000 confirmed cases today 20 deaths. country world low death rate Texas. yes don’t get wrong Pandemic medical skills drastically improved, unless Texas hidden medical knowledge aren’t sharing rest country world full shit. start world counters zero today current knowledge virus, every single state / country substantially higher death rate Texas (also Florida Georgia). tried testing DNA birth, wrong Texas? american fireworks, country music, TX BBQ deadly virus. grand prize raffle case Covid-19! Proceed nearest ICU claim prize, oh wait they're full. move Florida winters lmao, shithole. Find cheap place Northern Cali like Eureka Redding something want chill warmer place. Well big 3rd anniversary. much history held /s Check state department health website guidelines. realize first time people reported dying disease without positive test right? assumed it. happening too.

Source please. Thanks!  First, curiosity. Now? attention. idea big Texas actually is, many rural areas effectively untouched covid? Try rational thought. Get ready climb Hmmm...I might case well...similar time frame....similar problems. Surrogate pregnancy Covid died car accident, counted Covid death Canada

Source please. Thanks! us many examples dont understand response. ^ said Love Include México that, president Lopez obrador complete moron clueless baboon power Yes will. impractical close things down. Unless miracle vaccine treatment, quite literally beginning here. dumbass politicians accepting reality bad spiral control. Yep Nope knew back made statement, knowlingly made false statement hospitals ""run out"" Agreed. heat 200° 15 minutes.

[The study authors cite previous research demonstrating heating masks 70oC (158oF) effective killing SARS-CoV-2 virus.

While disinfection techniques also proven effective, heating done anyone access Wait... before? Agreed Doubt it. Many isolated incidents wrong coding, fraud. let local leaders start opening everything back up, like Texas. You’re welcome! accidentally forgot take second dose last night felt shitty today realized that’s ALWAYS used feel. I’ve gotten used awake refreshed feeling Legit thing rural Oregon dying done Northeast hospitals overwhelmed come pass. things reaching critical mass hospitals reaching overcapacity elsewhere. Yes! outdoor thing drives nuts. ""People walking around everywhere without mask!""

Yes, POSE RISK VIOLATING MASK ORDER. even though masks general big deal wear, become big deal outside exercising heat extended period time.

People want simple. ""Masks good. good. bad."" That's also piss poor messaging get people mask compliance see flaws argument. lol According numbers 200-250 deaths given case load 2-3 weeks ago?

Instead we're still average deaths. we're getting better treating virus? Awesome!  preschool teacher tell Elmer's actually nice glue. Congratulations! predict colleges offer enough online options stay home. might direct path degree hopefully work out. Man. jealous must say. Super frustrating living central oregon people taking seriously. Glad calmed Massachusetts older parents live HA!

That first thought well. took 3 whole months see anything. [CA] Cases increased slowly CO since 16 days ago (157 261 avg). shallow gradient though. Testing rate still pretty good. Nothing alarming yet. Biggest one day spike till next Tuesday  Nah, we'll find country great vacation spot decide need democracy. nobody actually read article? reason comments Black Lives Matter protests, Covid19. another rake attack I've thinking thing. risk sounding paranoid, suspect changed permameters reporting deaths related Covid-19. want sound insensitive, occurred US gets infected faster, build immunization get working economy sooner? 


I understand thinking absolutely shit, supporting it, asking (and you) maybe current administration's plan (if plan all) seems like the's handle situation whatsoever, even information ahead time risk what? He's already recovered it.  Actually proud CT once. good job. perfect, good. 

At point protect own. Plenty people going taddletale neighbors going town. Mandatory basic income. Make election point reviewed 4 years. still cheaper corporate bailouts. Keep population alive priority. Thank capturing reasons people wear mask. come rebuttals people. state mandated masks. rate gone 50% people. Canadian everywhere cold man fuck, im trying move Florida winters, love Murica tbh Well even secret service gave him. “He’s old enough know right wrong, let him...” problem Newsroom. remember Deepwater Horizon episode Newsroom staff immediately starts immediately starts asking questions seem almost impossible asking time.

That’s huge difference lol. upcoming brain drain stuff legends. happens inevitably halt classes shut down? students asymptomatic incubating going go back respective towns spread communities. what's going happen, I'm calling now. Whatever worse case scenario is, going accomplish it. simply reacting, planning foresight required. major fines! problem jail time they'll spread virus jail lot places releasing people jail. Go big fines ankle bracelet enforced home arrest - never ending quarantine. going France Thanksgiving. Oh we’re friends anymore. hope thing every summer literally said nothing President recommending. said zero reputable studies support use COVID. spewed retarded shit me. study not?? Think demolition derby. Monster truck vs minivan. want one without vehicle? mandatory mask traveling public transportation.. schools closed two month period (only highschool kids still home others back school without problems).....all gatherings forbidden till least September....1,5 meter distance everyone......we able manage it......most done common sense though.
So managed people too......which seems difficult country 'the Lord' rules politics even though pretend not. that's looks outside looking in. Well there's surprise! McCOY PERFORMING! You’re American doesn’t make wet pants 

I'm Texas, American, assure pants pretty dry America rich people whole lot poor nearly homeless people can’t afford three week lockdown.

That doesn’t make rich country, basically makes third world country. Natural selection point. LOL! 😂 Yea don‘t think using projection website using 7 day averages makes lot sense talking daily tests lol

You look data source Florida covidtracking, it‘s literally state Florida, doesn‘t get accurate :) Sweden 2019, it’s 

In Norway 2019 it’s 14%, Norway half population Sweden. 
([ 

I drew connection segregated society, necessarily foreign born. 

So world point making analysis, since you’ve already made mind Sweden 5000 deaths? seem pretty certain. STOPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

stop playing emotions. you? mom? Thanks!

What guarantee republican Democrat elected fall? Excited solution here. I’ve never seen Burger King doesn’t serve burgers breakfast hours. Burgers main food. Comms degree lol Oh misunderstand, I'm registered third party member. pointless struggle coronavirus test reportedly costs 370 yuan (US$53) China......

Source : Hong Kong News paper- Hong Kong, test fee $3000HKD， (roughly US$450 ?)

I mean, shall free people form low-income family. US cost much？ Can't find tests Los Angeles next two weeks, even though mayor county say they'll test anyone regardless symptoms. Yes, test available appointment slot... bad available appointment slots foreseeable future. Guess we're hitting testing wall we're going getting full picture moving forward. Literally embodiment wanting something told it, wanna anymore. 

Except thousands people's lives. middle class much longer keep way. might few, otherwise tiny handful strike rich, everybody gets pushed down. Thank you, means lot me.
I'm virologist, used observations logic. ""super-light"" version meant response body virus. bad strong healthy people get immunity? vulnerable group elderly people people serious diseases, government protect maintain proper conditions like food delivery smth.
About testing coverage - considering difference national cultures. mean, instance, Italy people used greet people kisses hugs (maybe stupid stereotype, I've never Italy) either way, need consider talk positive cases. Maybe get point clearly check smth people get cases. Question statistics think.
Before invention vaccine collective immunity save us sealed shelters course. Try r/covid19 believe SARS side effects temporary could last quite long. Diminished ling capacity might permanent though since pneumonias cause it. Brattleboro here. Yeah live Vegas n half ppl know n thought cool can’t resist going clubs n bars soon opened. Stupid mfs gonna get gym shut Sorry hard discussion everybody full hate.

It started suggestion making healthy life choices get much negativity thrown me.

Could kindly elaborate wrong exactly? Agenda?

Do mean calling people are?

Again, literally thanked this. Please specific issue, likely addressed. whole world could coordinate efficiently scale could get rid without killing people lol Ich komme nicht aus Bayern, also kann ich auch nicht CSU wählen. Seems like voting either big two much better. They're controlled corporate interests. lead destruction middle east. Neither interested real reform. come different packaging - one appeals left (politically correct, diversity supporting, etc) one right (America first, God loving, etc). Trump managed somehow defy usual formula right mobilizing alt-right.

There one person interested actual, meaningful changes shut pretty hard DNC status quo twice. disappointing voter turnout help. want continue journey corporate takeover.

Why vote someone big two point? there's ever going third option emerging, going begin small percentage votes. ? 🙄 got really lax around North OC numbers last week seem rattled sense folks see 95%ish compliance masks inside stores. see many people chin hammock approach thankfully.

Of course, house across way 15 person party today. outdoor, social distancing sort adhered masks maybe 10%. I'm convinced gatherings what's us in. Yeah remember back saying starting wars ""terrists"" least that's chickenhawks saying. 200 kids die every year circumcised. terrible big picture..  Here’s depressing thought: would think one upside greater daily cases means we’re getting closer herd immunity, sooner.

But would take 542,000 new cases day, every day next year, get 60% country infected, accomplish herd immunity.

🤦🏻‍♂️

And doesn’t even count people 200+ countries world landing airports every day. WE'RE FUCKING TRASH CARE MONEY YEAH MERICA.... Stupidity number one disease vector. That's true countries Korea New Zealand bother trying. 😕 Yea, there’s hell lot idiots backwards ass country. love lot things US like half people make want move different planet really incredible medical community murdered 130000 Americans conspiracy.

Fauci, 08 March 2020 you’re 80 likely die diseases. Straight up. shut economy protect older average age death? risk held responsible actions better understanding virus/data? prefer latter.

From articles I’ve read, Covid doesn’t seem live surfaces transmit surfaces way initially worried. you’re asymptomatic you’re less likely spread well. This.

The mask rule probably saved people would’ve saved everyone panic bought masks. sentence probably applies lot politicians right now. way sounds, likely similar Tamiflu. antiviral taken early enough reduces symptoms healing time. 

Which, unlike tamiflu influenza could actually important though, really know what's causing long term damage yet. information 24 languages Agreed upon who, exactly?

Plenty people calling election reform long 2016. Yes, voices got louder joined Trump, like everyone agreed perfect, infallible system one single election.

All highlight need change. That's true. ""Corona warn app"" would expected make due \~300 per week? aware get job time want, right? stay-at-home order lifted, companies hiring left right. *Laughs New England* Ahh, good point. .2 ifr recovery isnt actually looking like recovery. Post covid syndrome seems likely, scare potential dying part.  Everyone busy flexing freedom muscle saying virus would ""burn out."" Typical approach us. use approach freedom denial climate change issues. life changed since dx lockdowns? saying related, I've experienced similar pins needles lot since lockdown, simply due reduced activity, working home(less ergonomical desk chair, standing desk) causes carpel tunnel poor posture issues. hands go days, dad brother suffered surgery carpel tunnel, probably me. thought. discounting COVID though. Thing sucks. Yep sister nurse least virus conscious person family. Also consider massive spikes FL TX, even states well bombarded new infections states Instead, get Godzilla rising ocean levelling San Francisco like it! Yeap got nurse friends abiding mask wearing such. think witnessing human nature raw form. Sucks is. Archive link: authorities succeeded putting leader's shirt extend testing, former national coordinator corona tests believes.

- Swedish system major shortcomings division responsibilities, says Harriet Wallberg.

The World Health Organization last week pointed Sweden special risk country, association countries Azerbaijan Kazakhstan. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell noticeably annoyed:

""They looked number new confirmed cases per day, increasing recently started offering tests everyone symptoms,"" told TT.

The day after, toned warming number serious cases decreasing, time warned proportion positive results comparatively high level. Sweden remains list risk countries, time Swedish tourists welcome across border Denmark Norway. Germany, Swedes placed quarantine 14 days.

The fact Sweden image went yet another walloping partly due high spread infection. also Sweden late wider testing.

- know exactly infection spreads society, since tested widely before, says Harriet Wallberg, appointed government Sweden's test coordinator three weeks May.

#Ended infection tracing

The public health authority abandoned strategy test contact trace infections mid-March, [limiting testing tracing] test enrolled hospitals well nursing care staff.

- **Broader testing part Swedish strategy therefore efforts made support regions build capacity, says Wallberg.**

Many countries made assessments. Germany Iceland, among others, succeeded expanding capacity continued work infection tracking.

- also recommended broad testing infection detection, says Wallberg.

Only April 17, Public Health Authority presented expanded testing strategy. Instead broad testing, strategy based four priority groups, jeopardize effects extinction healthcare.
- took office frustration Minister Social Affairs tests carried out. Although national testing strategy place, little happened April May, says Wallberg.

#The lab stood ready

On May 8, government commissioned produce snapshot regions identify bottlenecks.

- turned already capacity test 100,000 per week. fact, that, Wallberg notes.

Nevertheless, many regions managed test priority group 1 patients.

- Several regions yet managed test everyone symptoms priority group 2, **which nursing staff**.

The brake pad consisted logistical challenges.

- digital systems would link testing journal systems developed. logistics samples would transported also place.

Sweden's 21 regions forced build unique systems. uncertainty would responsible costs recorded, according Wallberg.

- Several regions afraid incur costs covered, delayed.
On May 31, Harriet Wallberg discussed observations Social Minister Lena Hallengren (S) head Public Health Authority. week, 36,500 people tested, 45 per cent healthcare care staff.

- **I proposed change strategy: test broadly test everyone symptoms regardless priority group. must isolate positive begin carry again. Especially elderly care.**

#The state pays taxi

Only June 11 government Sweden's municipalities regions formally agree: state would responsible entire cost. week after, Stockholmers invited test themselves. state pays taxis leave collect tests homes.

Sweden tests 60,000 people per week.

**""In rearview mirror, ask done before,""** says Wallberg.

It precisely question responsibility discussed afterwards, believes.

- Swedish decentralized system regional municipal autonomy works reasonably well crisis. crisis situation, pandemic kind, obvious major weaknesses.

#Should tested wider

The government ultimate responsibility crisis, Wallberg believes.
- clear corona crisis, government trusted expert authority, Public Health Authority, national responsibility recommendations decisions related infection protection. regions operational responsibility.

TT: failure tested before?

- **I think kept broad testing infection tracking built capacity much earlier. all, tested broadly elder care homes. There, testing important tool protect risk group, says Wallberg.** 'Urges' 

'Recommends' 

This working, governors finally going learn? I'm 60s thinking social responsibility piece. remember kids died measles. father contracted polio child. Fortunately him, able overcome it, effects worsened grew old. think young people taking COVID seriously grew vaccinations illnesses killed kids young? 

The thing I've thinking lack civics courses schools. high school, took course taught us responsibility citizens community members. fact, ethos permeated public education family life, perhaps soon WWII. example, parents routinely sent care boxes family father met Germany war. thing civics today think important? probably accept Biden next president... technically soon work Biden? /s Urge? URGE?! Stop urging people spineless prick place order. that’s large part parents. system people parents believe sending kids school go raised, fed, taught, etc etc. 

Its supposed tool experience promote growth life, source. 

The telling tale parents don’t force/encourage children online learning, made kid go school essentially free day care. 

And that’s issue, parents don’t care child’s education, want place send kid day. Thanks do. *typos chubby-thumb included* Stay salty. MAGA chud? Check. Chill, outdoors. lines Cape ice cream shops, ...😳 Mayor wants once-sized fits answer instead independent local governance. bet wont stick situations. think okay (and good) change mind based new knowledge. people like opposite authority recommendations (just like rebellious kids) look ridiculous justifications actions.

I believe motivations good, reasoning think they're hiding anything, numbers make sense, drastically dropped times weekend curfews people careful, one cares going again, still strict restrictions crazy high numbers like brazil official, I'd add Philippines list openly admitted stated mask use shown positive impact virus spread. also repeated times mandating it. Dan Patrick acts like listening Fauci first place. Oh yeah, forgot incident! ""I incurable status effect. Instead logging game, going biggest hub I'm going spread everyone dancing middle city."" used live Lowell. used say: ""When Lowell..."" status Sweden context EU??

I know Switzerland part EU part free movement area Norway like semi-member EU subject rules technically separate. recent travel restrictions announced EU earlier week rest world, assume Sweden included part EU right? time, remember reading ur posts regarding many countries Europe placing restrictions towards Swedes. gets kind confusing here, legal framework behind this???? slogan ""BAMA!"" though? ""Roll Tide"" even stranger. mean nickname? work large university New York zoom meetings students/staff fled. None anxious return New York. Judging now-shut-down Facebook feed, ""fake news"" Anyone refuses fired immediately.

Covid minor virus working age people really justification work never been. Huh Better stuck plague ship months country allow dock. God bless Cubans finally let one cruise line disembark. Thank clarification. Fauci proven liar - said masks needed early March, promoting them.

During interview, said make decision prevent ""mask shortages"" essential workers.

THAT divided mask situation - people listen government advisors (when lied),

Now, people power angry confused - White House expect? 

Unless violent division planned... Coming soon United States near you! Ah, yes. gentleman gave us sage wisdom ""Grandparents would willing die save grandkids' economy"" ""There important things living"". makes sense want listen medical advice, given firm support virus. Beef already 50% me. Second wave, first, whole lot higher whole lot worse. live Tennessee left Massachusetts visiting family. nice seeing everyone wear masks keeping distance. I’ll go back home minority again. Sucks.  lol says ""unSwedish"" cover ones face. Clearly north wintertime sort wear skimasks go outside sometimes gets really cold. Good luck homeboy. also said black people afraid life pulled over. 9 unarmed black people killed police 2019? 9. afraid would statistically equivalent afraid piano falling head.

...what mean *only* 9 unarmed black people killed police? sounds acceptable lol world war 2, Americans thought Japanese crazy using kamikaze bombers.
But Americans basically thing killing much slower method. Oh wish case. Remember, people mentality problem problem. yeah make sens great thanks. Population density doesn’t account third deaths. life CO hasn’t changed really. hysteric. people claiming earth flat sarcastically. Religious folks however genuinely believe planet 2000 years old. Well 2020 now. ironic massive effort went trying avoid panic actually increased death injury toll. Good. Fuck Fauci. Bill Gate’s rat needs thrown prison. Brrrrrr Inovio's stock double digits - barely Yeah different Freedom. Oh god. heard back season 😞 stay safe friend believe Lindsay Graham said interview “over dead body” get renewed. sentiment echoed Senate. pushing payroll tax cuts, work if, know, actually job. first country? See tomorrow! place time. Here's Florida's latest case/death list US states counties, ranked per capita deaths: Ehhhhhhhh Bama's academic standards actually increased fucktown last decade, largely due influx qualified state students wanted go party atmosphere- ah. yeah. me, thankfully, thought exercise.
 
I marketable skill set even international stage. said, local environment, there's one, maybe two jobs field. 
 
My me, unemployed situation, nearest next job opportunity 60 miles away.
 
Would make work, sure. I'm situation many in. I've moved clear across country work before. 
 
The problem finances. let's break comments. 
 
1. wrong. Companies care. show work sweating ass stinking, going care. rains way in. boss care show soaking wet. 
 
But let's say bring wipes spare set clothes. Add 20 minutes clean up, another 10 variance sitting moment. 
 
8 hour day, 8 hours walking, plus change time. 16-1/2 hours day. constant labor. impressed see someone weeks able fully functional work.
 
Which brings bigger picture. Let's say right, new boss give damn issues outside work. 
 
Who think hell hire, walk 4 hours way, guy owns car drive 20 minutes away?
 
And bring skill sets, etc this. things equal, getting hired. guy reliable transportation is. Period. market flooded jobs seekers. great many options besides you.
 
2. Nice agree something. part point, point within itself. 
 
3. Delay expenses? Really?
 
Like what, rent? Power? Food?
 
4. I'm making excuses. I'm painting picture reality seem see.
 
In vacuum, sure hard work pays off. used to. 
 
This grandparents age anymore. Companies give shit worker anymore. want cheapest, reliable worker get. 
 
And picking someone walk next town someone local. Hell, things equal, hire someone next town one local even car.
 
So hard work dedication worthless companies even bother. 
 
5. story mention proves point. Yeah, busted ass earned place. got lucky too. luck always side. 
 
Today's market like one in. Ill recant, if, 10 years there's someone similar story pulled 2020. wonder much spending leaves country travel. Presumably money spent domestic travel. citizens also can’t leave easily.  people parents. Like 85% people kids hard generalize biggest demographic. point what's point?


You either it, don't. Everyone else either . 

We want anyone catch it, take every precaution can.

Once clears up, go back normal. ""Your facts fit lie tell supporters"" 

*Inserts fingers ears*

**LALALALALALA CAN'T HEAR YOU....** normally work offices home rushed back work boss?

Office work grey area. Governments around world encourage work home considered 'essential services' bosses ""ask"" return work.

So refuse go back government advises ""stay home can""?

Anyone faced this? it? refuse?

Anyone hear refuse get asked? think happen? FWIW common tactic paid trolls accuse others paid trolls. used argue lot climate deniers online time shown users accused others paid trolls often paid shills themselves.

I've never outside debate seen many unfounded, blue accusations one side towards ""paid trolls"" debate Swedish strategy. Something keep mind. American way. ....but sent pics. supposed move Netherlands Ohio work, company banned travel unless business critical. Trying hardest convince critical get shithole two things happening 1) essential industry get flaunt health safety precautions 2) mostly immigrant labor probably illegal get flaunt health safety precautions labor laws well. basically get unregulated industry, Americans want rest country well. wear masks, wash hands bit? rest world without issue.

I mean, told drive right.You without issue affront rights. Why? drive left would endanger lives. 

Why respect life lives others? People put lives line keep safe provided for. least could shown respect them. Wearing mask make sheep. means prepared minimise risks lives.

Now look mess in. Ironically Trump even win popular vote. targeted stupidest states lied pandered particular group people and, course, Putin probably hand helping dope get elected. completely embarrassing terrible human represents United States. really speak majority citizens. American Academy Pediatrics reputation conservative cautious, would expect organization devoted protecting children’s health. week, academy made splash advice reopening schools appears somewhat odds administrators hearing federal state health officials. 
 Centers Disease Control Prevention, example, advised remote learning safest option. academy’s guidelines strongly recommend students “physically present school” much possible, emphasize major health, social educational risks keeping children home. 
 Sean O’Leary, pediatrics infectious disease specialist University Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, helped write academy’s guidelines. father two children, 12 16, survivor Covid-19 still experiencing symptoms wife contracted coronavirus March. 
  absolutely take seriously,” Dr. O’Leary said. “I’m still sick.” explained academy emphasizing need get students back classrooms. 
 interview condensed edited academy guidelines place big emphasis importance physical school remote learning. summarize why?** 
 pediatricians, many us recognized already impact schools closed even couple months children. time, lot us parents. experienced kids online learning. really wasn’t lot learning happening. we’re seeing studies documenting this. Kids home led increases behavioral health problems. reports increased rates abuse. 
 virus different respiratory viruses deal every year. School-age kids clearly play role driving influenza rates within communities. doesn’t seem case Covid-19. seems like countries reopened schools, plays much smaller role driving spread disease would expect. 
 March, idea children silent superspreaders put older adults vulnerable people immense risk. picture changed?** seen far literature — anecdotally, well — kids really seem less likely catch infection less likely spread infection. seems even true younger kids, 10 12. older kids seem play less role adults.
 Colorado, I’ve following state health department website closely. update data every day include outbreaks state investigating. imagine, lots lots long-term care facilities skilled nursing homes, restaurants grocery stores. total four child care centers, lot child care centers open. almost every one cases, transmission two adults. kids centers spreading Covid-19. I’m hearing thing states, well.
 academy’s guidelines talk balancing need physical distance children’s educational developmental needs, need hands-on play. suggest older students masked, three feet distance desks might sufficient, compared six feet recommended C.D.C. advice different?** 
 don’t know we’re different. C.D.C. said six feet “feasible.” point trying make is, that’s really feasible. consider overall health children really community large, adhering six-foot rule, would mean lot kids home, may best interest overall health. Something give. 
 perspective pediatricians, downsides kids home versus school outweighed small incremental gain would get kids six feet apart opposed five, four three. add mitigation measures like mask wearing, particularly older kids, frequent hand washing, bring risk down. 
 think it’s balance. I’m going come say June 30 everything going perfect coming school year. cases Covid-19 schools even make best efforts. balance overall health children. 
 talk school administrators, planning temperature checks. academy guidelines warn could impractical take away instructional time. say you’re skeptical right strategy?**
 harms outweigh benefits? case, means students congregating, could increase risk spread. don’t great evidence temperature screening helpful. That’s couple reasons. One, lot kids Covid-19, perhaps majority, never get fever. use fever screen assume that’s going good enough? miss kid. many fevers going Covid-19. Kids go school fever, period. 
 preparing guidelines, emergence potentially deadly pediatric inflammatory syndrome linked Covid-19 sway all?** 
 talked it. measure rare condition. it’s something pay attention figure causes best treatment. also point even kids gotten sick, vast majority recovered done well. 
 guidelines emphasize teachers school staff members stay physically distanced greatest extent possible conduct meetings remotely. hearing lot teachers. Many are, frankly, scared go back school vaccine available. told feel health treated expendable. What’s message them?** 
 pediatricians. We’re educators. don’t want tread space don’t belong. would say depends level risk individual person. Every district talked Colorado? making major considerations teachers, trying figure keep safe.
There couple things know didn’t know closed schools March. One masks really seem work. effective. Two, physical distancing works well. taking many precautions can, think risk pretty low. 
 personal decisions. schools lot things really make environment safe possible.
What hope next terms local schools making specific plans reopen?** 
 gets rolled August September schools reopen really dependent going time virus. you’re state well cases, measures guidance far less important. you’re place virus raging, things become much important. 
 country, get page. It’s tragedy virus become political issue. It’s costing tens thousands, potentially hundreds thousands, lives.
Reopening schools important kids, really entire community. much world relies kids school parents able work. Trying work home kids home disproportionately impacting women. goes beyond health child, is, course, important. country, everything right now, lots reasons, make sure safely reopen schools fall. Damn, guys public gathering masking seating policy still effect? American media much worse 10 years ago too. estimates put ratio 10 1, would make IFR .5% . NYC antibody tests show IFR .7-.86%

I totally agree 150 million infected - thing stopping 750,000 deaths vaccine. Hard see 30,000 deaths month, don’t think we’ll another 21 months disaster.

I hope get federal change January 2021 get actual federal response point. updates Clorox tablets? Rich rebuilds put one 2000. might something here. I’m little confused (sorry already mentioned) good majority bars aware /visit occasion serve kind food appetizer. clear, people go food.

So actually closing? monstrously dumb mother fuckers. Get clue assholes. Everyone wage deflation, hard good drop price stay steady get consumers buy food increase. It’s going mess. Someone sounds bitter jealous. Hope said goodbye well morons. too! HVAC people coming today work AC (it's going 100 degrees higher next week, repair can't avoided). 

I'm going wearing cotton mask, filter pocket, top surgical mask, interact them. bunch old, white, rich people decided wanted buy overpriced fast food marketed organic shit, I'm back work. I'm entirely sure I'm supposed practice self responsibility, since come back work lose unemployment benefits. want us least likely die virus get prop economy bodies, maybe give us ability stay home want potentially kill bunch old people. God, hate fucking Red Wings. Meanwhile, Texas' latest case/death charts: ranking states counties per capita people stupid. 2020 years old. good comparison. great warning sign. post removed mod. Maybe that's see it?

Here's someone makes fun wearing mask reply saying ""no ok, wash hands make mask. borrow pen?"" See quickly people's demeanor changes. South Korea well rigorous testing quarantining infected individuals. mandated. outside.. public transportation... buildings... private businesses able make choice. complicated I'm sure Ro different Rt, Rt usually much closer 1, would mean lower rates around good. Well damn. mistake. got email chancellor 2 weeks ago urging us “low risk” teach face face classes give students service deserve committed employed University. Yeah. Um. No. Yes, that’s overall maximum benefit anyone. state uptick death rate correspond increase seen south west? know deaths lag looking NY data seems like seen something now? absence 'available ICU bed' database? found one CA flat past 2 seems like 'number positive tests', despite commonly reported, also least useful. Ideally we'd time history % positive antibody tests randomized group. absence that, make sense reliable metric look death count ICU bed availability? bad catch virus immune system fights successfully, still contributing spread. That's selfish asshole wear mask protect others. Improving diet, again, something may benefit you, completely useless for, say, cancer patients, people AIDS million conditions.

Wearing mask benefit everyone, majority population does. Riots. Really? Must missed smth. claim refugee status ... Well politicians pull money outta stock market covid, got someone steering around. conspiracy there!! Lol  Yes. two seconds.... rest American scientific community blatantly lied efficacy masks, extremely important subject, month. lie sowed enormous distrust scientific community. People like lied to. Dude like Trump-lite bars actually one drivers spread virus...  military reference study, recommended use home made cloth masks neck gaiters, essentially cloth extensions t-shirt neck long covers nose Yes, serves us idiots right. collective moron movement put us deserve be. Yes, getting $500 x 4.3 = $2150 month. 

There idiots too, seem think purpose life complain everything, matter what, vastly outnumbered reasonable people. ppl licking other!? 

what the..... like OP said, they’ll say fricking bad hospitals couldn’t handle capacity, should’ve planned better. covid made hate american 2000x more. Everyone mother bitching china misreporting situation doesn’t even make sense. offense really think anyone reading sub people “ignoring...things”? Doubt it. get coming from. have...

* States requiring quarantine enter high risk state. 

* Pence finally telling people wear fucking mask.

* California re-enter lockdown.

* Texas closing bars requiring masks bunch counties

* Kansas going start requiring masks.

Here's article states reversing openings also requiring saying things great. fact virus hitting bunch different areas think mean take seriously. We'll see guess. going fine, Japanese people good following rules. 

Look Black Friday crowd, amazing variation factory town model: Buy large island. Football Island! Build arena dorms. Isolate everyone it. Charge players food rent they're playing almost nothing. Play one game day. need one officiating crew, one set doctors, etc. Put cameras everywhere island film multiple reality tv shows. Makes sure there's hookers blackjack good stuff. pandemic turn island amusement part/historical center/resort. Profit? “Clearly, bar owners less interaction, proximity frequency patrons beauticians, cosmetologists, tattoo artists,” lawsuit obtained CBS News says. 

Even true, think that's quite problem here... Live let die unc? Reporting pedo. media trying divide us. government trying see far we’ll go new rules. People don’t realize they’re actually manipulated pawn. They’re trying turn people create chaos. Don’t give in, bud.  know dog whistling black people 2020 hip hop pop music modern country shitty rip that. Think Sam Hunt, lowest common denominator. ""Let us make profit killing people!"" population 17million, 50thousand cases 6000deaths.

South Korea population 51million 12thousand cases, required people wear masks.

You relatively good compared countries collapsing. Put mask dum dum. Check CDC's Stats States. Causes Death. 

Stroke, Heart Disease, Lower Pulmonary Disease, Flu deaths quite high states refused mask mandates.  Nope Whoa. thought way Dr. Klein has. Sweden quite possibly end isolation vaccine found due herd immunity policy. ironic herd immunity supposedly 'get rich quick' scheme would avoid wait vaccine. countries herd immunity (aka rest Europe) want people traveling hot zone protected infection. then, keep borders closed hot zones Test, Trace, Isolate strategies upended. 

It notable Norway far one best outcomes Europe actually probably best mainland Europe. shows ""OnLy IsLANd NAtiONs SucCEEd ttI"" protest based falsehood. Norway maintaining extremely low burden infection even one worst affected countries (Sweden) sharing long basically impossible perfectly control border it. demonstrates TTI even effective thought. 

Yes, Sweden exported infection Norway far caught early on. Hopefully continue. mom passed March 20th. wish could. don’t need mother feel safe. know several kids can’t play sports longer due virus. keep talking ass. Nothing brave you’re doing. You’re endangering others complete total selfish piece shit. literally worst country offer. Void intellect reason. person listens everyone experts. real fucking genius. bottom feeder. lowest form life earth. insignificant shit stain. taint crumble sense you. Part problem. Lacking intellect. state live Alabama? Sounds depressingly accurate.  can’t imagine folks children dependents this.

Hopefully busy creating fools live suffer world one. Taking boat Denmark Norway weeks. Even allowed travel Sweden normally (you travel road Denmark Norway Sweden) wouldn't.

It feels strange isolate Sweden. all, still. link actual data shows Covid commonly causes permanent after-effects?

Or .. considering many people recovered far, come arent putting videos YouTube struggle permanent damage? ""My Journey Covid"". much found all. Tattooed, bandana head, pudge rolls,low rise jeans tyranny shirt on. Merica baby People still socially distancing there, probably way US point missed point. areas breakouts? 100% know area quarantined june 22nd.

They ran local screening 3750 swabs first 40 cases found first 750 swabs today news ran additional 3000 swabs finding almost 30 cases. That’s bad analysis never lemon pepper dry rub? one get hopes vaccine saving situation. anti-maskers damn sure taking vaccine. least precautious taking seriously protected least. Let's see. take issue decision. find ironic Gov. Cuomo said RI turned away cars NY license plates unconstitutional. Sadly, pay attention hive mind lately, clear sarcasm. I’m betting people upvoted don’t think it’s 100% serious. Taxes never lowered? ever going see eye-to-eye, I'm going bow-out future responses. made educated guess based name Rahul comment inlaws. Looking profile comments, Indian lives Pop country plus pandering every single damn song annoying. 

Just listen Bo Burnham's song song Pandering 95 year old meemaw preexisting conditions!! /s don’t want rude grandparents died various viruses past never made big deal effects old fragile immunity. really make sense me, see effects disease everyday. severe cases really rare there? reason scary? Triggered? someone wishing death disease others?

I'll wear proudly.

I'm done letting bigots fill reddits hate-filled commentary pushback. It’s either/or. Debt deficit increases recession due lack tax revenue. concern debt, want avoid recession. upgraded version of, floor lava? surprise absolutely one, quite without mask. hillbillies think virus joke. think considering bigger name schools like Alabama. thousands colleges offer athletic scholarships student athletes never heard of, many got full ride scholarship play sport love earned degree along it. every student athlete one done NBA Kentucky. Good her. 😒 reason Nascar racing nba coming back guess feel like lottery, living beautiful state people seem taking shit seriously know death bit lagging indicator, TX still around 35ish deaths day?

Because deaths ""bit"" lagging. lag 4-5 weeks. logic terrible  saddest part. Covid highlighted decline American leadership world. good lasted. Wouldn’t make threats like y’all would leave alone Yeah unfortunately think crowd ever go away still hear MD definitely quieter pleasant change things considered. *cries Alabama*

I ask it’s hard track every state extended period time, fall reopening spectrum, well adherence social distancing mask wearing?

As example, Alabama shut “everybody else it” really wasn’t taken seriously. well fact formal shut less month (I believe 2-3 weeks) we’ve pretty much back full swing since. result we’re one outbreak states right now. governor zero plans add restrictions. goal keep everything is. Well socialist system would regulate demand this. sucks capitalism even say can't share numbers either. Capitalism fucking sucks. Yeah MyChart pretty awesome. worked couple years clinical application, hated life two years would never recommend job anyone except maybe developer (hard maybe). Same! “That makes sense.”

No, not. going set Robin Hood? mean weren't? ""Enforce rules!""
""How dare enforce rules told to!""

I feel bad employees like this. They're learning shitty try police right now. they're often minimum wage. even person making $2k week? Yes, shithole become I’m 100% opinion Governors playing politics constituents, waiting things get bad take action. way, play sides fence.

Björn, Britt Erik say shows respect. residents Djursholms dinners usual. keep two meters away even outdoors. 


And Björn's bridge nights happening net, says. sake others, one infected.

On side glittering water, sailing camp progress, Lidingö's luxury villas visible. 

The postal codes Lidingö severely affected SARS-cov-2 corona virus areas retirement home. 

Otherwise, residents Liding Island also taken care extent hospitals covid-19.

And look inner part Östermalm, trend same. Östermalm densely populated than, example, Djursholm, many people treated hospitals confirmed covid-19. 

Zip code 115 23, parts Narvavägen Strandvägen Linnégatan Östermalm, many inhabitants Zip code 151 51, Ronna center Södertälje. 

But postal code Östermalm significantly less confirmed infected, Expressen's review shows.

#Tegnell: ""Spreads differently thought""

Expressen's survey shows areas severely affected corona virus many ways areas classified Police Authority vulnerable particularly vulnerable areas.

These include Rinkeby, Tensta, Fittja, Husby, Malmvägen Sollentuna Södertälje areas Ronna, Geneta Lina. 

""It disease strong socio-economic link,"" says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. 
What mean?

- factors spread infection make people live crowded meet lot people hit often harder people large housing, easily work home. preliminary assessment. pattern recurs many countries. 

Initially, Public Health Authority denied covid-19 spreading rapidly densely populated areas so-called clusters.

#Today sounds different.

It spread like flu virus wave population.


- spreads differently initially thought, number ways. spread like flu virus wave population. spreads much hopefully, called cluster spread, know good word. seems jump one geographical area group people, eventually move another group, Tegnell says. 

The big question why?

- fully understand due yet, says state epidemiologist. 

In part, however, Tegnell says, may people spread virus all. Instead, spread disease much, unusual illnesses like influenza measles, according state epidemiologist. 

Express's review shows exposed areas nearby zip codes, many confirmed covid-19. 

At time, survey shows postcodes affected elderly home high spread infection, indication infection spread elderly home neighboring houses surrounding postcodes low number infected.

#Many people develop diabetes vulnerable areas

A year ago, Public Health Authority released report health foreign-born persons. 
The report shows move Sweden generally better health people born Sweden, comes so-called welfare diseases diabetes, obesity high blood pressure. 

But five years changed radically. 

Three percent African country diabetes come Sweden. stay many people develop disease, five years, 14 percent diabetes. 

The tasks Public Health Authority's own. high blood pressure, obesity diabetes three risk factors comes covid-19.

When gets stressful, one prioritizes one closest oneself? lacks multicultural thinking.

- No, think so. comes minorities, mission monitor health development, many years worked primarily Somalis increase vaccination rate, many authority originating countries. think suppressing situation. addition, basic assignment equal health, says Anders Tegnell.

#Sensitive tasks

Detailed information spread covid-19 difficult obtain infection control physicians.

The Stockholm region want disclose information spread infection postal code for, among things, Lidingö Lovön, Drottningholm castle located. Rinkeby nearby vulnerable areas, information went out.

Only Expressen's reporter Frida Sundkvist asked Stockholm region secretly stamps spread infection upper-class areas, discloses information Rinkeby, Tensta, Hjulsta, Husby Akalla, general counsel Anne Rundquist made decision requested information disclosed.

#Postal Code 145 52 - Fittja, Botkyrka

The thermometer says 27 degrees, feels like 35. yard Fittja's apartment building, Adrian, 4, William, 3, play water grandmothers watch. 

Fittja classified particularly vulnerable area Botkyrka municipality. distribution covid-19 also widespread surrounding postal code areas Hallunda, Norsborg Skärholmen, Expressen's review shows. 

Maia Gladysheva granddaughter Adrian, 4, Adrian's friend William, 3.
Adrian's grandmother, Maia Gladysheva, says stay home Fittja summer. play here, houses bathing place.

Postal Code 151 51 Ronna, Södertälje

In southern part Stockholm region Södertälje three sister areas Ronna, Geneta Lina. three classified Police Authority particularly vulnerable areas. 

During April May ambulances shuttle traffic went emergency hospitals Södertälje Huddinge. Ronna, June, 27 people confirmed covid-19, Stockholm introduced widespread testing.

This means 2 percent population confirmed infected sampling, based Statistics Sweden's population base postal code. 

But now, end June, ambulances longer heard often. 

Gabriel Ataseven, 63, stands balcony Ronna Centrum looks out. belongs one well-known families Södertälje, entrepreneurs businessmen restaurants properties city. 

- want coffee? cries balcony. 

He says made sure parents, illiterate, stayed home ever since March. belongs risk group diabetes. 

He moved 1975 since area changed lot. ethnic Swedes lived here. 

- Today, many people left, says. 

On balcony entrance Ronna center hung large flag. 

- Sure hang Swedish flag ghetto, laughs. 

Not far balcony Issa Hendeyi hand hand mouth protection face. one ten people gathered outside health center Ronna tested covid-19. 

Issa Hendeyi tested covid-19.

""I would like know,"" says, standing shade again, holding forehead. 
She says government done good job fighting pandemic. 

- Stefan Löfven good! exclaims thumbs up.

Then called testing. level restrictions everybody regardless risk levels seems foolish, especially factor negative side effects continued lockdowns. 

We know virus dangerous others. pretending don’t? 

We know ways lower risks even further. Wearing masks public practicing good hygiene common sense responses global pandemic. also know things lower risks, even risks never completely gone. aren’t also asking people improve diets alongside wearing mask washing hands? 

The public response virus makes absolutely sense me. news media reported crisis New York months ago, exactly going though minds people south west? #Translation

Low voter turnout, high unemployment widespread congestion characterize several vulnerable suburbs [in Sweden].

There also highest proportion infected covid-19.

The infection spreads fastest Sweden's poorest areas, shows Expressen's survey 130 postal codes.

In upper-class areas Djursholm Östermalm, almost infection free.

Detailed information spread covid-19 Stockholm covered pandemic confidentiality infection control unit Stockholm.

But Expressen gotten information hundred postal code areas.

The figures reveal abyss difference rich poor areas metropolitan area.

It poorest crowded suburbs covid-19 hardest attachment care hospitals.

- continue look groups see affected others, says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.

Despite virus's clear socio-economic link, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven talked almost exclusively failure high death rates elder care.

The figures show virus, clusters four eight nearby zip codes, infected one two percent living restricted area. 

The figures collected Stockholm region extended testing private individuals, therefore include people confirmed sick care, well number tested due work health elderly care sector. 

If Public Health Authority's report April 23 true 75 unconfirmed cases every confirmed infected person, right herd immunity prevails several Stockholm's vulnerable suburbs. 

One Rinkeby.

#Herd immunity

So-called herd immunity achieved enough people population infected achieved immunity disease. 

However, according state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, herd immunity never completely eradicate infection.

#Postcode 163 73 - Rinkeby

The sign call stay home symptoms longer remains Rinkeby Torg. standing since end March, death toll skyrocketed. 

From first death covid-19 March 11, elderly woman multi-generation residence Husby side Järvafield, around 40 people Somali background died area.

Nobody talks corona anymore, everyone talks pedophile.

The bodies buried according Muslim custom within two days. funerals hundreds participants may served early infection catalyst Rinkeby, government - advice Public Health Authority - reduced maximum number participants 500 50 people.

Now, end June, flea market cross street square open again. outdoor seating square crowded guests, whole square full people. 

""Nobody talks corona anymore, everyone talks pedophile ,"" says Ali Awal, 44, meet square.

Earlier spring, stayed home symptoms covid-19. 

Now smiles says warm people finally socialize again.

Even Rinkebystråket, outdoor seating full men hang out. mid-March, street next public moved outside wore facemask. Now, hardly anyone wearing face mask

The feeling danger over. 

#ABOUT FIGURES

The data relate confirmed infected persons tested admitted hospital, employment health care. figures collected Stockholm region scaled testing. 

If number infected persons postal code nine fewer, Region Stockholm disclose exact figure. Therefore says &lt;10.

Infected numbers 10 marked red dot, 9 fewer black.

Coronavirus autopsies: story 38 brains, 87 lungs 42 hearts

What we’ve learned dead could help living.

Ariana Eunjung Cha

When pathologist Amy began grim process opening coronavirus dead learn bodies went awry, found damage lungs, kidneys liver consistent doctors reported months.

Rapkiewicz, directs autopsies NYU Langone Health, noticed organs far many special type cell rarely found places. never seen before, yet seemed vaguely familiar. raced history books — eureka moment — found reference 1960′s report patient dengue fever.

In dengue, mosquito-borne tropical disease, learned, virus appeared destroy cells, produce platelets, leading uncontrolled bleeding. novel coronavirus seemed amplify effect, causing dangerous clotting.

She struck parallels: “Covid-19 dengue sound really different, cells involved similar.”

Autopsies long source breakthroughs understanding new diseases, HIV/AIDS Ebola, Lassa fever — medical community counting covid-19, disease caused coronavirus. vaccine likely many months away even optimistic scenarios, autopsies becoming critical source information research possible treatments.

When pandemic hit United States late March, many hospital systems overwhelmed trying save lives spend much time delving secrets dead. late May June, first large batch reports — patients died half-dozen different institutions — published quick succession. investigations confirmed early hunches disease, refuted others — opened new mysteries novel pathogen killed 500,000 people worldwide.

Among important findings, consistent across several studies, confirmation virus appears attack lungs ferociously. also found pathogen parts brain, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, spleen endothelial cells line blood vessels, previously suspected. Researchers also found widespread clotting many organs.

A mysterious blood-clotting complication killing coronavirus patients

But brain heart yielded surprises.

“It’s seeing,” said Mary Fowkes, associate professor pathology part team Mount Sinai Health performed autopsies 67 covid-19 patients.

Given widespread reports neurological symptoms related coronavirus, Fowkes said, expected find virus inflammation — — brain. little. comes heart, many physicians warned months cardiac complication suspected myocarditis, inflammation hardening heart muscle walls — autopsy investigators stunned could find evidence condition.

Another unexpected finding, pathologists said, oxygen deprivation brain formation blood clots may start early disease process. could major implications people covid-19 treated home, even never need hospitalized.

The early findings come new U.S. infections overtaken even catastrophic days April, amid critics say premature easing social distancing restrictions states mainly South West. new modeling study estimated 22 percent population — 1.7 billion people worldwide, including 72 million United States — may vulnerable severe illness infected covid-19. According analysis published month Lancet Global Health, 349 million, four percent people would require hospitalization — underscoring stakes autopsy investigators continue hunt clues.

Microclots lungs


At best, autopsies reconstruct natural course disease process new highly infectious-disease tedious requires meticulous work. protect pathologists avoid sending virus air, must use special tools harvest organs dunk disinfecting solution several weeks studied. must section organ collect small bits tissue study different types microscopes.

One first American investigations made public, April 10, New Orleans. patient 44-year-old male treated LSU Health. Richard Vander Heide remembers cutting lung discovering likely hundreds thousands microclots.

“I never forget day,” recalled Vander Heide, performing autopsies since 1994. “I said resident, ‘This unusual.’ never seen something like this.”

But moved onto next patient next, Vander Heide saw pattern. alarmed, said, shared paper online submitting journal information could used immediately doctors. findings caused stir many hospitals influenced doctors start giving blood thinners covid-19 patients. common practice. final, peer-reviewed version involving 10 patients subsequently published Lancet May.

Other lung autopsies — including described papers Italy 38 patients, Mount Sinai Health study 25 patients, collaboration Harvard Medical School German researchers seven NYU Langone Health seven — reported similar findings clotting.

Most recently, study month Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine, found abnormal clotting heart, kidney, liver, well lungs seven patients, leading authors suggest may major cause multiple-organ failure covid-19 patients.

Heart cells


The next organ studied close heart. One frightening early reports coronavirus China significant percent hospitalized patients — 20 30 percent — appeared heart issue known myocarditis could lead sudden death. involves thickening muscle heart longer pump efficiently.

Classic myocarditis typically easy identify autopsies, pathologists say. condition occurs body perceives tissue foreign attacks it. situation, would large dead zones heart, muscle cells known myocytes would surrounded infection-fighting cells known lymphocytes. autopsy samples taken far dead myocytes surrounded lymphocytes — leaving researchers scratching heads.

Fowkes Mount Sinai colleague, Clare Bryce, whose work 25 hearts published online yet peer reviewed, said saw “very mild” inflammation surface heart nothing looked like myocarditis.

NYU Langone’s Rapkiewicz, studied seven hearts, struck abundance rare cell called megakaryocytes heart. Megakaryocytes, produce platelets control clotting, typically exist bone marrow lungs. went back lung samples coronavirus patients, discovered cells plentiful there, too.

“I could remember case saw that,” said. “It remarkable heart.""

Vander Heide LSU, reported preliminary findings 10 patients April in-depth paper case studies review journal, explained “when look covid heart, don’t see you’d expect.”

He said couple patients performed autopsies gone cardiac arrest hospital, examined them, primary damage lungs — heart. country, would rank 2nd world covid deaths per capita, behind tiny country San Marino. Belgium, completely ravaged COVID, would distant 3rd behind MA. think rest US would rather associate way around. We’re basically taking exams right thanksgiving extra long winter break ""all Gilead’s projected production July 90% production August September""
So that's 3 months potentially preventable deaths Trump wants get reelected, get fuck pretentious ""good grief"". China done Americans would losing shit. Two words: ck AZ interested development vaccine - progress. Edit: spelling Yup. 65-year-old neighbors I'm close to, one lung disease, like this. Go almost every day, people multiple times week, whatever. scared angry first point I'm numb I'll ready get phone call they're sick now. fairly big city, didn’t drive tests county, rural county next us lot less people. weird. basically forced us go ER try get touch doctors pretty busy whole thing answering phones. Thanks response. mutation response makes lot sense me, functionally identical good news. Hopefully, change.

The nurse going vaccine doctor speaking towards it. There's obviously way we'll know long term effects long time. guess hope vaccine limited testing those. This. I've never come across set people whines complains trivial things every second lives. 


It's freaking mask , wear entitled assholes. meat processing plants owned China. last time ""potential meat shortage"" turned bullshit. shipped hundred thousand tons meat China.

""That month, Smithfield sent China 9,170 tons pork, one highest monthly export totals market past three years. Tyson exported 1,289 tons pork China, since January 2017.

In all, record amount pork produced United States — 129,000 tons — exported China reason crying wolf ""we're going shortage"" pass legislation would allow remain open regardless coronavirus complications.

If piss off, should. I'm already sitting thinking, course there's fucking outbreak processing plants. What's Outline? kinds fun ones drew on. cute, I'm getting orders friends. said. I'm blonde pale. I've go skin cancer several years ago even though I've diligent sunscreen since general usage. mask makes feel fair face even protected even 100 percent sure without shadow doubt regarding accuracy antibiody tests? give mace republic let get work. gonna start giving lot money private owned businesses, cant hundreds thousands businesses shut this. LOL, comment vaccine fall. December ""who cares is"". keep moving goalposts....  Unless weak enamel genetically. Right. read article.

Elon musk say, ""you stay home days worried covid"".

He said. come worried covid. actions (only allowing 31st) exact opposite words hence getting bad press. hope gets award expert tells us trust experts, mean trust experts? love Elon (or say want love Elon) continues make close-minded mistakes, except they're implicating people's livelihoods. stock break 1,000 share. made problem worse, better.

What percentage change death rate claiming also likely antibody tests catch 50% exposed. E.g., much NY infected

What part ""that IFR possible even every man, woman, child city already virus"" clear you? Remind 6 weeks  Can’t debate without linking articles? mean articles post debatable too. Resulting snowball effect. want move America living 2020. patience politicians citizens. Another one... three apparently translate article better Google Translate.

But one tried.

All trying article censored.

I wonder why? New Zealand bunch countries got cases zero would disagree you, even assuming right, much better catching catching April, mortality hospitalized patients dropped four fold. matter next 5 years won’t leader trust anything positive, matter wins (imo). Woohoo think active effort discredit 538. think everyone thinks predictors 2016 election wrong, lump 538 others without knowing talking about. Idiot governor lost control state. few? damn near half country point. Haha, family friends Litchfield county unfortunately know mean. never crazy outbreak there, tho, they're primarily spared never large transmission rates. I'm sorry head injury. Good luck recovery. American Association Pediatricians wants us go back school sickness transmission kids 10 rare. article break ages enough tell children question mostly ages 10-17. Conflicting information? sources prove protests contribied spike *because can't contact trace protest*. here, provide literally first Google result links far scientific, peer reviewed, literally region specific. 

Your denial insane. Thats pretty neat, get current data?  release it, body ready. Someone needs call our

Florida going new york help? gosh sakes don’t go. live NJ still haven’t even son’s grandma lives mile away inside house. people aren’t critical thinkers. Hey, borrow Navajo's leaders? People already producing bulk.

And won’t immunize everyone end pandemic. serology results showing MA? Based best IFR estimates, have, conservatively, 23% population infected. easy assume that, article never states that. really sticks fire chief follows rumor legally/illegally gets information doctors.....but dates ""party-goers"" diagnosis shared whether quarantined 14 days diagnosis. Absolutely. survive find long-term secondary conditions person forced learn adapt love them.

However life go on, lost physical ability many things used enjoy doing. one example - was/am avid amateur photographer, however impaired vision limited obvious obvious ways.

Obviously difficult actually see shooting, however much less obvious resulting difficulty hiking. Walking uneven ground, nature, become nearly impossible me...and able all, far less enjoyable. must constantly watch extremely carefully walking order avoid tripping and/or falling small rocks, branches, obstructions.

I largely stopped shooting DSLR gear. Fortunately iPhone pretty nice job situations still shoot lot that.

Driving another thing loved do. However, still able legally keep driver’s license (questionable state laws opinion) certainly don’t enjoy driving more. stressful always “on edge’. prefer wife drive us anytime go somewhere, occasionally run local errands.

I could go many examples isn’t condition. really warning get people start becoming aware big difference surviving viral attack healthy again. completely healthy attack hit me...and limited areas even completely disabled others.

Just don’t buy headlines focused death rate. many serious issues consider. symptoms started March 16th. worst symptoms already gone away (fatigue, mental fog, nausea, SOB, constant cough). still lingering cough, aches, waves low grade fever. access Texas's plans could say. 

I would hope would talk NY get places well. staff 1000 bed hospital 24/7 going take lot effort. article poorly written, get parts study wrong. excess 28% increase. time frame March 1 May 30. 

The study:   simply offer better translation add value post, rather simply try post censored?

Is something article want people able read? kind says everything Sweden's abject failure protect vulnerable groups.

No doesn't. might right, know. hypothesis higher fatality rate. would sincerely interested Sweden would jump conclusion fits narrative. 

This says great deal you. eagerness jump conclusion Sweden fails protect minority group soley based higher fatality rate, shows lack basic understanding epistemology shows dishonesty willingness misinterpreted data fit narrative. bias Sweden quite apparent.


Here article ""Coronavirus (COVID-19)
related deaths ethnic
group, England Wales:
2 March 2020 10 April 2020"" 

*""This provisional analysis shown risk death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) among ethnic groups significantly higher White ethnicity.""* probably figure high living standard means, post drivel. Hey thanks positive words friend. malignant cholesteatoma. incredibly rare get cholesteatoma much less malignant one. Anyway thanks supportive words keep awesome. understand comment directly relates said. I’m American wrong friend  Oh, good person... hope polite enough. highly doubt international students rushing get unless school offering long distance online option. Yeah, people know something subject change views encounter fresh evidence. Shocking know. always, lots post every day day. Good them, long. Yeah seems like people getting symptoms slight lung inflammation notice. Big problem still causing severe illness enough people hospitals going overwhelmed. Really makes hopeful thing end quickly though (assuming catching virus gives sort long term immunity, still kinda unknown). /u/udntcwatic unskew numbers please Seems like petri dish theory working. fuck dipshit mayor now? asked yo leave private property trespassing. That's police responding to. try adjudicate asked leave. misunderstand things work Yea worries. One thing note remembered students saying called respective country embassies help. e.g study france, call french embassy. Might use. Good luck. US cost much?


We ask question everyday lives everything. I'm shocked  liked much better losing Obama. :/  long hospitals overwhelmed plan. Unfortunately, certain states refusing wear masks take precautions causing hospitals reach boiling point requires either lockdown skyrocketing IFR rates.  How’s different? virus doesn’t stop spreading you’re different kind building I’m door dash rn it’s actually really good don’t mind full time hours obviously costs consist use car
However 40-45 hours I’m pulling 1k+ week something consider live city Absolutely! I'd love help understand beast better. article fairly informative, yes, states fine state's policies. Yes. 

1. needs spread enough distrust science people stop trusting scientists statistics (done). 

2. convince masses media biased lies teeth (done). 

3. convince opposing party corrupt anti patriotic taking rights away (done). 

4. Use money gets lobbyists pay people surroundings could make life difficult (in progress). 

5. Convince population he's one protect destruction society (in progress).

6. Profit racist whether meant not. Agreed. last read estimate antibody tests undercounted cases around factor 10. includes cases occurred back February March tests short supply. Today running 600,000 tests day positivity rates still around 6-7% nationally. way currently undercounting factor 10. everyone asymptomatic lol. Yes, numerous articles due fake news foreign minister. Good point.  disagree current direction US going in. celebrate 4th love country overall don’t want live anywhere else, doesn’t mean love every aspect it. disagree translation, post believe correct translation rather simply attacking OP?

Is even properly translated version article would bolster argument?

You coming across someone trying prevent article even posted, someone concerned article translated poorly. safe public swimming pools, town's case, small public swimming pool? ask me, matter size. one swimming public pools right now. Unless I'm wrong? stock 401k's. seemed think something. might weekend lag though. Test conducted Sunday, results reported Tuesday. That's usually way goes. noted, still week week. today's 45k tests final result even though 2 PM Florida? We've created monster I've read comments people who've viral pneumonia ( covid) mentioned took several months fully recover atrength stamina.

Couldn't what's happening? curbside delivery option you? believe recovered. [A person COVID19 subreddit linked two never told climb mountain good you! think pandemic, definition ""young"" got lot older. like privacy it. allergy symptoms improved. I'm sneezing way less, good others too. unsettling truth states handle also huge percentage people infected, indicating herd immunity playing bigger role people credit. MA, example, IFR estimates point infection rate mid 20% range (as month ago so). Probably closer 30% now. best estimates herd immunity 20-50% range. say mitigations, masks (critical) social distancing also help. seems like nowhere US, including MA, achieve enough compliance mitigation efforts eradicate thing without significant suffering. Don’t know??? it’s hard American. Life rough us US. many choices places go spend money on, can’t make mind want eat steak restaurant, go see movie 3D, indoor skydiving... it’s much decide want spend weekend. can’t add mask wearing top that! would friends think? 

More importantly, would president think?! going back gym single best thing happen lockdown. Yes, could exercise home thing, almost nothing mental health. would say find time gym empty quiet, example go time friend. I've back month I'm always super looking forward go. Excellent rebuttal Yeah. way understand riots/looting came protest. Ya'll give shit them, let exist investment country...well surprised respect property.

And case, health. Yeah cousin dd well side money said really great lives at. pulled house day whole map lit up. know area well reliable car definitely something look into. Thank you! currently part 2 Stage II reopening. detailed 4 Stage reopening plan, involve masks. went big grocery store last week. Every single man, women child wearing mask. Employee shopper. 

You see correlation policies COVID here: bought bunch stock I'm pretty sure efficacy going matter.

Yes, I've read generic brand produced much less cost, least drug available us repeat PPE State/Country bidding war. would also wager 95% people choose wear masks ALSO likely aware risk protest, thus careful weeks aftewards, might gone protest all.

So, protest might cause 1000 new infections immediately, masked-protestors deciding extra-careful might prevent 1000 cases following time period might occurred been, hence cancelling effect protest net number. Prague Florida equivalent Czech Republic? *cough* bullshit *cough* Updated, thanks catching that! one salon arrived outside city Delhi lot cases city. local administration reported source salon. Can't really say anything sure. Society can’t afford several years Gotta wonder y'all get dressed morning. Especially everyone wears mask, outside relatively low-risk 1.5% could low estimate total infected though, especially North Carolina (which hasn’t particularly hard hit) actually anywhere near 12-14%. 

Again also don’t think matters much exact IFR know skewed heavily towards old infirm. overall average isn’t particularly useful information individuals (though might policy makers). 

It’s good news regardless whether it’s closer 1.0% 0.3%, either way it’s much lower initially feared 2-3%.

EDIT: actually don’t basically know absolute fact overall infection percentage far higher 1.5%? confirmed cases alone gets us 0.8%, think it’s highly, highly unlikely we’ve confirmed anywhere close 50% total cases, especially given limited testing early part outbreak.  data really make USA appear well...? Highest positive rate, highest % tested total population, bad (having terrible pandemic though, Canada example simply need many tests, we're actively looking people symptoms come get tested), deaths total population look OK, losing control whilst Canada UK (not sure Sweden), obvious USA under-counting deaths, Florida example 5x usual rate ""pneumonia"" deaths year compared normal years. 

USA pretty bad, especially currently, seeing new surge whilst countries seeing case counts going still, waaaaay initial peaks.

Fortunately I'm one states staved best - things change. It’s treatable, hasn’t enough time tell lasting damage. I’m sure children hospitalized it, many do. similar autoimmune disorder called “Kawasaki Disease”, don’t think causes lasting damage treated early. genetic component, kids mutation. Currently lot DNA sequencing going determine genetic component it. I'm following science.

TLDR: PLEASE COME LAS VEGAS! know one person making extra $600/week unemployment, got right pandemic hit, that’s person know actually receiving it. basically living hope extra $600 windfall coming day now. whole economy smoke mirrors haven’t even seen worst yet. especially liked: “This America!

I personally preferred comparison wearing mask wearing underwear, his/her own. Even impoverished third world nations much better U.S. taking appropriate precautions.

This actually good sign. shows rich countries like Germany, small countries like Switzerland, keep things control. Even poor countries like Vietnam, large countries like China, well. 

This means hope everybody overcome pandemic.  called Greed, Gluttony.

Too fuckin easy. Exactly ""others"" No, numerous news sources independent foreign minister. conspiracy theorist. Funny, remember saying anything Desantis. saying statement ""can literally go testing center get tested"" conflicts multiple news reports across state, already linked thread. can’t really argue this. announced... technically new additions.....

So, we're adding 45k cases day now. current spike already 20% higher thw ""peak""that killed 100k people still shooting straight ward. fucked. evidence protests spreading disease yet strong evidence bars church services do, contact tracing efforts linked outbreaks two places.

Just think small towns Texas, AZ, SC, CA etc 0 protests protestors seen 5 times increase cases DC NYC biggest protests held.

Protests might spread covid, significantly less people gathering indoors without masks   need 14 day mandatory quarantine addition mandatory testing day 2 13 order enter New Zealand. forever want never imported cases. always known extinguish virus, question whether want pay price.

I’m wondering would still eligible Coronavirus Aid checks even though “voluntarily terminated” &amp; fired? New York City’s Covid-19 epidemic peaked late March early April, the city reporting more 5,000 new confirmed cases day, 60% of tests disease coming back positive. Arizona, similar somewhat smaller population (7.3 million versus 8.3 million), new cases are currently averaging 3,000 day 20% tests may keep getting worse Arizona, Covid outbreak may eventually surpass New York City’s. it’s long, long way getting there, I’m guessing won’t. isn’t say things looking good Grand Canyon State, Texas, Florida, Southern California or places experiencing big growth coronavirus cases. specific conditions enabled awful explosion disease New York City important conditions near-total lack awareness understanding going way late. beginning March, New York’s first Covid-19 cases were confirmed, 10,000 people city may already infected, according a modeling exercise conducted April. reproduction number (the number people person expected infect) that has since estimated at six late February early March, total subsequently exploded. A new study of blood samples taken non-coronavirus patients Mount Sinai Health System hospitals city indicates many 800,000 New Yorkers may been infected week March 16, the city closed schools and many began working home (the state’s stay-at-home order went effect March second half March was also testing disease began get ground big way, point demand overwhelming severe cases underlying conditions could get tested, hence sky-high positivity rates. mid-April, according an antibody survey conducted state at end month, 1 about 1.7 million New Yorkers (20% city’s population) contracted disease, 12 times number confirmed cases Arizona, 15,000 people tested daily — level New York City didn’t reach May. percent testing positive risen 9% 20% past month, sign testing isn’t adequate keep spread disease. Covid-19 raging control New York March, least yet. Data scientist Youyang Gu, creator one better coronavirus forecasting models out there, estimates that 330,028 Arizonans contracted disease July 1, four times confirmed-case number. explain % positive tests become ""stuck"" fewer tests? understanding simply relies math, lowering number tests would alter % positive. Months ago. 0.4% got revised down. Education system works tad differently here. Form 5s major (nationwide) exams Form 6 (pre-u course alternative) well. I'm sure exams postponed, nationwide exams probably main reasons. Ok; let person respond stop defending don’t know legit not. one comment claiming doctor, win argument another thread, rest comment history speaking Chinese. doctor, speak probably going phased rollout vaccine: first they'll vaccinate medical workers extremely at-risk populations (elderly immune-compromised LTC), essential workers, children, regular adults. possible someone like (healthy 30-year-old) able get vaccinated summer 2021 later? Definitely. ""all nothing"" situation: start vaccinating portions population, combined (hopefully) improved therapeutics decrease mortality rate time spent hospital natural mild/asymptomatic infections require minimum, any, medical care, think unreasonable life start look ""normal"" come Christmas 2020. 

Your statement might wrong vacuum enough supplies get EVERYONE vaccine late 2021, deliberately defeatist tone acknowledge late 2021 likely we'll much control flu. That's getting downvoted. thought family spread greatest . Clearly doesn’t.

•About 40% time tested four days exposure virus.
•About 20% time develop symptoms tested three days symptoms started. Preventative measures would cost effective... different country... love analogy Extrapolated year would leading cause death mile

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Symptom-based screening skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) inadequate detect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Repeated point prevalence surveys identify asymptomatic cases outbreaks.

**What added report?**

Repeated point prevalence surveys 26 Detroit SNFs identified attack rate 44%; within 21 days diagnosis, 37% infected patients hospitalized 24% died. Among 12 facilities participating second survey receiving on-site infection prevention control (IPC) support, percentage newly identified cases decreased 35% 18%.

**What implications public health practice?**

Repeated point prevalence surveys SNFs identify asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, inform cohorting IPC practices, guide prioritization health department resources. Exactly. find everyone, virus, die without ever getting tested. source? following virus since January I’ve seen outbreaks meat packing plants workplaces unless consider prisons, medical centers nursing homes work places. haven’t seen studies places causing community spread.

Instead it’s bars, churches, family (and other) parties imported cases Europe seeded spread here.

Ild love see sources have. recap:

1) there's lots data shows protests correlated higher infections;

2) data showing protests correlated higher infections;

3) there's evidence early reopening correlated higher infections;

4) plausible reasons data regarding protests (outside, high mask use, protests resultant curfews keeping general population home, increase form protests getting swamped data much larger effect reopening, etc)

Looking available evidence, proper conclusion there's simply large increase cases due protests.  Print fill scorecard AZDHS shared showcases gets treatment hospitalized. Well, someone got defensive. again, I'd embarrassed too, someone pointed compared 4-year old adult complained 4-year old act like adult.
Edit: Also, actually deliberately say suck parent, even though definitely thinking it. reached conclusion yourself. :D I'm it, though likely means I'll work even longer store relies restaurant bring enough customers. visited hospital lately? could start Houston, maybe? they're moving patients town hospitals, Houston full, even patients coming in. easy blame young people world's ills, everything fine came along. make good scapegoats failures leaders older people refuse change. Covid causes NFL truly gone far point. :( Trump-Pence effect, effect narcistic egotism wrapped religious omnipotence illiteracy results fumbling even elementary, foreseeable situation. fairness, lose job, making money, likely going unemployment while. I'm pretty sure NYC well even reopening large protests. showed close 25% antibody prevalence *April*. probably closer 35% now, many showing T-cell immunity. Another study came recently saying herd immunity work closer 40% given non-homogeneous mingling people society.

There second spike NYC. going finish slow burn that.  10-20% undercount drastically change death rate. Yeah bud, fuck you.

I'll pass getting horrific virus. US country transmission rates going right now.

Every country suffered casualties first wave learnt use fucking masks, karen. lot states following trajectory Texas, Florida Arizona. Better put fire early impose strict measures.

Probably going happen though... Maybe health care? It’s usually regulated. maybe Norway wants abuse Swedes health care sector too. attended college Boston, MA. Back 75 uni’s colleges Boston. 

Don’t know now, getting virus control there. going happen city dwellers general kids Arizona, Cal, Florida, etc., come school? It’s professors administrators they’ll put risk. It’s entire Greater Boston area, everyone it.

One single conference believed started wave engulfed MA. ...and that’s Virginia. Funny GOP pushes importance education, getting kids back school time essentially gut education budgets nationwide. It’s like want kids house, enough resources/supplies school learn something, it’s unexpected bonus. many articles morning US fudging death numbers?

Like 10? Without looking numbers would say ""major hotspots"" cases surged/exploded/spiked etc?

Because they're USA USA restricted interstate travel, I'd stay away. Also would adopt takeaway. vermin said, ""There's important things living"" course! Let’s hope pans out. Ohhh dunno, think let loose Johnson could ruin lot UK lives. literally said social darwinism good. likely false positive. likely secondary effects mortality might reduce it, well. Like auto accidents work-related deaths lockdowns, well decreased incidence communicable diseases, influenza, due lock downs social distancing reduce transmission wide range diseases along covid-19.

I much agree interesting issue, believe may able address extent comparing deaths particular causes previous years. paper focused general mortality burden, though, includes aggravating mitigating secondary effects. think they’re talking ones packing bars without masks. hahah touche too’ Yeah 2020. still want get it.

I'm mildly immunocompromised. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* He’s neither scientist, engineer.

My gym literally blew last year cancel even emailed making jokes it. perfect, provide food need abide restraunt social distancing ordinance.

This effectively shuts actual bar tables mingling.

Its half measure, chip away risky behavior. Except states ruled local authorities couldn’t exact stringent standards state - like Texas. Also evidence work population studies highly unreliable. People NYC act differently Dallas, Seoul Tokyo. Cultures, density, holidays, government, weather, public transit play huge differences. Maybe masks, maybe something else.

On top initial worry shortages touching contaminated surfaces bringing face. wearing mask mean less droplets thus less contaminated surfaces also increases amount people touch face. there's actual solid lab research saying cloth masks block 15% droplets others block 70 80% depending quality material used.


All said, wear fucking masks! simple easy. works we've saved millions lives economy wearing piece fabric face. work laugh silly everyone looked 5 years now. truly hoping elections US buckle handle crap. Which, that's insanely late least better nothing "" Freedom isnt free ""

No, there's hefty fucking fee! Students want classes person. education expensive students need access studios/tools/means. understand picked ""the coronavirus bad"" hill die on.  Sorry burst bubble, none countries stayed closed ZERO cases. evidence otherwise **post credible link**.

[New Zealand fully lift restrictions active confirmed also ones. 

So guess move goalpost now.

😂 would help much bringing awareness greater public. I’m it. know that? 

The US population massive, deaths typically relatively stable similar periods year year.  slight bumps odd bad good flu year, would minor. Soooo basically go outside impunity? know Cambridge Somerville relaxed mask wearing outside there's one near you. I'm daily walks, I'm alone stretch street I'll take off, see someone approaching street back goes. Ah yes let’s make conclusions without evidence. Yet coronavirus tests cost $6,000 hospital... You’d think would everyone’s best interests, big pharma’s interest **always** beaten public health interests. Today Lt. Governor told us stop listening Dr. Fauci experts. 

We lot stupid greedy people country trying make public health controversial cultural wedge issue. state, you’d clinging onto good news I’m telling think America handle appropriately moving forward, must missed badly we’ve bungled response far GOP one anti science making pandemic much worse. makes disappointment even worse.

I confidence 2020 anything anymore. Take wild guess. Las Vegas staying open, saying, ""Damn torpedoes! Full steam ahead!""

I'm shock Las Vegas keeping casinos open sandwiched AZ/CA/UT getting tons people TX. work restaurant honestly need close indoor dining mean yeah blows I’ll jobless again. Cali people still oblivious don’t care guests don’t put masks get tables it’s scary.

I know people hate China handle virus seriously. us country many us don’t care. 

It’s terrifying. Wear mask safe don’t go weekend don’t need go drink friends. Despite yesterday's news stating: “We 100 folks recently went Myrtle Beach part high school age-related trip,” Goodfriend said, “who know come back positive result trip."" 

Oh boy... That's lovely line. Thanks. Adverse effects would've showed animal challenge trials. didn't, vaccine generally considered safe. Illinois checking in, keeping numbers low Stage 4 maximum 50 people allowed gather. Masks worn indoors. Everyone spending much time possible outdoors. Attitudes seem little better April May. problem media using coronavirus spear selective moral outrage president. know CNN doesn’t give shit 100000 dead Americans, every day subjected Anderson Cooper talking precious lives lost ‘Trump plague’ ravaging destroying fabric American society. hate say know doesn’t capture essence situation, 1300 Americans die day hypertension.

I feel like media agenda virus portray cataclysmic reckoning US reality, serious concern shouldn’t destroying way life it. Thanks link. That’s concerning. I’m doctor immunologist- hope isn’t case. Totally agree. league cancelled rest season. Health Safety comes first. hope uptick cases. survive without hockey awhile.

Read first post. Nikola fraud company. old groom? Sure, good point. see others thread suggesting burned stake. think India done time. expert Indian culture either. like people acting like cave people living lawless wasteland.

Fuck man, tell that. people would still call hoax. mask stop getting Covid19. yet even meet someone knows someone Covid19.  media biased full agendas, cannot trusted course. 

So said, wait wear mask actually happens live life instead cowering fear potentially overblown threat. Unfortunately 18 months long shut world especially guarantee 18 months. I'm wearing mask taking precautions certain point unsustainable save small percentage population. want saint want shred integrity. Look. grandparents fought right go gym pump up. hate America?

We’ll see. know Sati banned now, holding huge wedding pandemic husband clearly infected behind times, I'd totally believe wife heroic sacrifice thing. No. Coronaviruses much slower mutate influenza viruses, scientists expect one vaccine cover variants (they called different strains appear functionally identical moment).

That nurse sound like he/she knows much vaccines. true recent vaccines take long time develop, that's easy ones made decades ago. Smallpox rabies made matter months. easy taking virus, killing it, injecting person. Covid brand new virus, could easy smallpox/rabies hard HIV, far looks like got lucky going one easy ones.

Testing bit complicated. current leading candidate, Oxford vaccine, already passed safety protocols waiting evidence efficacy. side effects redness injection site arm soreness, typical type vaccine. I'm saying impossible kind long term complication, type vaccine rare - H1N1 saw sleep disorders influenza vaccines associated type facial nerve problem, extremely rare identifiable massively distributed (about one cases per million vaccinations, can't find stage 3 trial anyways). Live vaccines dangerous one trying make one Covid looks like safer ones going work. adding flights people going hot spots surging worse ever. Check.
I get gotta something flights may good keep middle seat empty doubt that. Seeing account around two years old posts constantly negative things Sweden nothing positive, (even non newsworthy articles like one posted protestor) one could argue account probably agenda Sweden Yes, many Danish visits resulted one email foreign minister. even talks prepping temporarily convert AT&amp;T Center (arena Spurs play) Covid unit.       
       
Here Massachusetts converted large BCEC convention center COVID back early April *in case* needed additional capacity. Meanwhile Texas beds, new daily cases nearly double Massachusetts peak. Utterly incompetent Texas even begun yet. available evidence suggests month’s Black Lives Matter protests contributed surge covid-19 cases. new working paper, researchers Bentley University, University Colorado San Diego State University used mobile-phone data SafeGraph, geolocation data firm, covid-19 case data Centres Disease Control Prevention determine whether protests associated less social-distancing behaviour covid-19 cases. fact, opposite true.  data 315 American cities least 100,000 people, covering period mid-May mid-June, researchers compared experience 281 cities protests erupted 34 not. One third protesting cities saw large-scale gatherings 1,000 attendees, making particular regions susceptible another outbreak. Nonetheless, found protests significant effect one way incidence covid-19.  also found one possible—and surprising—reason this. Protests actually associated increase social-distancing behaviour; example, residents overall spent additional 0.18 hours, 11 minutes, per day home (see chart). words, time residents spent protesting streets offset time people spent baking bread watching Netflix.  results could driven number factors. choosing protest might avoided going outside worry personal safety amid increased crime violence. businesses temporarily closed looting made going even less appealing. residents may stayed home higher perceived risk catching coronavirus. Finally, increased road closures blockages may also discouraged citizens leaving homes.  Remember everyone said trust China's numbers believed US numbers would accurate. Yah, neither.  Yup Seriously. understand FEELINGS important virologist thinks. appreciate commitment shtick comparing daily cases counts pretty useless noise reporting. want post daily increases 7 day rolling average % positive would sensational much useful. isn’t enough long term data full studies. remember right saying “There isn’t long term peer reviewed studies showing asbestos harmful” right initial findings asbestos bad. Again, scientists anything much vaccine costs. either, dare say slightly paranoid happened lol. Almost false positives... false positives. Experts... keep using word, dunno think means think means. ""Experts"" changing think daily point. respect opinion, gotta admit
You’re Jude law character contagion

If haven’t seen it, I’m calling conspiracy theorist

You’ve ruined intellectual integrity, go home, spent first month conflicting reports saying masks don’t help.

What Fauci said masks effective protecting wearer saved health care workers. entirely true. posted archive link always link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/YG3PG) Exactly; worst part 18 months blazing fast I’m optimistic, yet delusional.

Man, I'm really struggling trust here. insane turnaround, exactly want see. held control. Good them, could learn actions. 
 
That said, fucking unfortunate leadership spineless take actions sooner countries across globe reporting cases, numbers rising scientists shouting alarm bells like crazy. control put restrictions place. Think many lives would saved went lockdown week earlier. Tragic. Sadly, true. get worse number tourists allowing states businesses. Instead news articles don’t even link research, try reading actual research? didnt pause entire state tho 1,2000 deaths yesterday U.S. AZ starting contribute number substantial way. AZ also highest number per capital excessive deaths corona period... so, they're number much higher officially given. guess fail get government money? done. CLOSE STREETS CARS. 

Let restaurants retail stores use streets people engage stuff outdoors. It’s obvious hurts Point proven another year global south, much like swine flu, nothing needle production lol America would require marathon reach next town over

So never seen map USA? 

But even suppose true...what difference would make? walking ""marathon"" success requires...then do. Or, sit around pity-party whining unfair life someone owes things.

Either way, get deserve. I'm sorry given hazard pay- disgraceful. work school district hours drastically reduced least face face general public. absolutely right people getting screwed right big companies. that's pretty much expected great ol' USA, right? allow believe whatever fictions need cling delusions normalcy. agree Good point, rarely see posts outside new, due suppressing downvotes. posts punch make subs frontpage. mean get asked back old job delay looking new job (to extent rules vary state)

I know degree that's actually suppressing employment though. Plus honestly we're probably better less people going work terms beating virus. Ford STILL this? Tesla horrible right now. Things good terms profits losses mounting feeling pressure get back playing. Hopefully goes smoothly gut feeling disaster guess clarify, looking numbers growing like attempting go herd immunity current States’ testing government administration. Herd immunity disgusting idea without vaccine everyday DeSantis rollback extreme mitigation, another day seems like that’s administration silently wants. Positive? Definitely. People flock Long Island get indoor service... That's true. probably made good man. always striving better. truly worst part. Fuck people put politics safety friends family. HIPAA lol protests

You scientific data prove this? Yes saw lot protesters wearing masks, also saw lot pulling masks continually, getting extremely close friends even strangers.. touching things people touched.. 

The reason people keep arguing protests “didn’t affect spike cases” keep hearing data prove it.  data literally impossible contact trace someone went protest, lack data mean protests affect spike, can't tell. 

I went one bigger protests LA (and subsequently tested come back negative) entire time amazed little people respected social distancing, little respected keeping masks touching face..

The protests *are sole reason* spike, damn well contributed ""a cases"". Mostly wealth Captain Obvious hard hitting investigative reporting frontlines. Exactly. governor mandated pretty soft lockdown day. Bars, gyms, movie theaters, water parks ordered close prohibition gatherings 50 people more. pretty soft lockdown US standards, weak lockdown Italian standards. Restaurants, churches, retail stores remain open long follow 50 person limit. mask mandate, asked people wear masks worth.

It's little late opinion. Arizona headed bad path wish people live best. get ugly. correct, record high new cases, doubled less two  So, uh, anyone besides really, *really* skeptical this? rocket science. nothing, virus going spread, people hospitalized, people die. still people believing ""just flu"" non-sense? literally murdering people. Abilene vanish, would anyone notice except missing gas stations I-20?  think so. Except that’s works. bad lot mask wearers wearing nose, chins/necks lol. rode subway first time week 3 months disappointed people. even get started mess queens costco yesterday....it crowded virus ever hit. saw lady wiping face taking mask wearing gloves used hold cart touch things lol people really believe businesses going sanitize anything?

Most service workers overworked &amp; underpaid already. going actually sanitize menu uses? Sanitize every chair, table/booth uses? pens sign credit card receipts?

Most likely workers little possibly can, usual. Damn, half time servers even come back table check see food ok replace drinks. guess say true: everything bigger texas Younger people get hospitalized die lower rate, 0%. enough young people get infected, there'll still spike hospitalizations deaths.

Followed numbers everyday NY, initial spike cases deaths scarily high month, takes much time Hey someone told today death rate less 3-5% said I'm crazy thinking was. data World-o-meters accurate? number cases deaths list pretty obvious cases death rate even higher 5 percent. someone help here? person thinks lockdowns mistake I'm trying tell fuck off. Read article wondering thing actually. No. Covid specific hospitalizations. Perhaps per capita death rates compared cities completed first wave?

I'm saying worse, idea, seems unfair compare numbers one city fully completed wave getting started. could start bundling mortgages rich. bunch ppl care themselves.

Don’t get wrong, agree you. use nationwide nadir (to point) argument keeps getting perpetuated [nationwide] deaths still dropping everyone freaking cases [in states] increasing. whole purpose post indicate nationwide deaths continue drop 3-4 weeks nationwide nadir recent Arizona nadir. 

And get granular details Arizona deaths, it’s hard see deaths increasing clearly bounces around, seven day moving average indeed increasing since exactly 3 weeks local cases nadir.

Edit: also, address comment mortality rate potentially going (minimally), think true - small extent. experience working doctor icu large tertiary academic medical center populous city, gotten comfortable treating patients this, long enough ventilators everyone needs it, would suspect IFR fall (slightly! Like 0.7% 0.6%) move second phase this. Remdesivir hasn’t proven mortality benefit, might MODEST one. Prone positioning helps. patients essentially ARDS following protocols ARDS helps (assuming wasn’t done universally before). Like, instance, news came steroids helping. medical centers already that. We’ve noticed high thrombosis rate patients. medical centers increased intensity prophylactic anticoagulation monitored closely symptoms clotting. makes difference. 18-1 Sadly, almost posts label USA public shaming. humanity lived hundreds pandemics eradicated single disease; yet, still restaurants.

The type lag appear world still say ""This New York"" absolutely way hell takes Janurary reach 300,000 deaths.

Anyone channel tries spin story right left immediately terminated followed formal apology correction network. Again, would require endless supplies money since sadly work like would popular people middle extremes would hate equally, ratings would poor, least would reliable source information truly wanted it. no, reported deaths significantly lag (like 4-5 weeks) people get infected. Yea man say similar things. Even another buddy go ""youre still talking pandemic? Dude need mental help""

I said oh worried biggest life changing event sickness century nearly, yea whos concerned plebeian shit? 

I wish virus discriminated based people's thought process science etc He’s endangering lot peoples lives- deeply resent 

how dumb possibly be- Endangering thousands people going proven science  find level open allows us function without virus exponentially need stick level.

Sweden EU yes. EU restrictions guidelines rather STRONG recommendations, countries choose follow them. example Sweden could theory let people US wanted. might cause EU countries clamp harder borders re: time, remember reading ur posts regarding many countries Europe placing restrictions towards Swedes. gets kind confusing here, legal framework behind this????

So yeah, understand countries *obligated* follow EU recommendations matter basically make border rules. Denmark say wants borders closed Sweden since good reson (the burden infection high) that's fine. 

FWIW explained Danish BFF verified he's usually right, fits recall reading various places, think correct. People really terrible self assessment realization.

Even NPR Planet Money says Like Hoover-viles 1930s Awesome open outdoor concerts festivals long masks required  Getting really excited one free. pay logged in. Holy shit. 15% positivity?! That’s fucking insane, like actual herd immunity without vaccine insane.

Nope, even close. 15% 45k tests. 45k self-selecting sample already showing symptoms. Healthy people get tests (though likely people without symptoms virus well). currently 6,5k day testing positive. know ~80% people virus exhibit symptoms, 6,5k 20%. Let's assume 32,5k (= 5 * 6,5k) new cases day Florida. That's, 0,15% total population Florida getting infected every day. reach herd immunity 65% would take 400-450 days rate.

In reality guess would take longer virus would slow hosts become immune. Depends also long antibodies stay active there's lot variance. 6,5k 20% 25%, suddenly looking ~550 days herd immunity.

Just wear mask help keep moisture droplets yourself.

Don’t touch face mask public.

Take shoes entering home wash hands thoroughly. 

If work around infected individuals high risk area, remove clothes door place directly washer, take shower.

Ain’t disagreeing. It’s another arm educating suppose- providing data, rationale decisions, etc. hey Informs populace. populace learned critical thinking skills tends side data. Even Mexico barred USA non essential travel. CDC estimated roughly month ago. Seems like bit low number based many serology studies seen, perhaps approach number virus kept away vulnerable nursing home residents. 0.34% positive rate

That's amazing, go Italy!! Buddy, *we* know believe. people clamoring Darwin Award. must live fairy tale land. universe works balance harmony, fundamental law nature. CT resident here. Same. yup US border stay shut vaccine.

Its nuts. children thriving virtual learning! found better way. 3-5% occupancy help poor work environment home.

They extremely cautious. appearing permanent assholes things right temporary period needed to. many countries things returning normal without threat immediate infection actually took seriously short term open like black Friday weekend.

Guess I'll start half gallon milk fridge... hate it’s dumb word action it’s widely used debase argument person using disagrees lol. personally hate latter, still use it’s proper term action displayed mentally handicapped. talking small percentage people abusing system invalidate system. vast majority people receiving UE desperately need it. Imposing crack downs whether every single recipient refused job offer would complicate system. Instead self-certify turned job offer.

Indeed, laws books theft, people still steal. put every item store behind locked cage would ruin vast majority honest. old tests way airway, testing centers use nasal swabs, good. mean, he's douche bag spreads misinformation COVID-19, yeah, cool objectively moral hate him. social scientist friend Harvard School Public Health said widespread concern become prevalent enough keep people home majority Americans know somebody knows somebody becomes sickened virus.

The friend made deeply unsettling observation public order could begin breakdown Americans forced genuinely 'shelter place' 60 days colleagues say necessary. said 'genuinely shelter place' means way China, Vietnam Bergamo Italy - i.e. minimum, cutting exits air, rail, boat car affected cities, counties, states towns, testing virtually everybody affected areas setting quarantine facilities found positive enforcing 'stay home' orders everybody else, allowing genuine emergency movement brief windows buy food, etc.

He went say that, point, may take 'the Vietnam solution' slow virus meaningfully U.S. meant complete stop forms domestic intercity transportation international arrivals (other returning nationals, would need stay monitored quarantine facilities least 14 days).

Count horrified. others pointed out, cannot look confirmed cases deaths. huge amount cases went unaccounted for, particularly March - April US testing started ramping up. CDC estimated least 10x people infected March compared tested. large amount people infected completely asymptomatic (meaning show symptoms throughout entire illness), lot studies (and believe CDC) estimate 1/3 (33%) infections asymptmatic. Taking account asymptomatic infections serological studies examining antibodies, mortality rate likely anywhere .1 - .5%. CDC even gave preliminary estimate .4% mortality rate exhibiting symptoms. factor asymptomatic cases around .25%. age 50, mortality extremely low (not 0, still low). obviously increases age deadly 85. Look around rest country - bars/restaurants closing hot spots spread.

The data also shows starting phase 3, cases stopped dropping started flat-line. means starting phase 3, Rt number increasing. went decreasing flat line, next steps increasing.

Im watching numbers closely county (Erie) flatlined around 31/32 cases 7 day average last 10 days. 6/20, steady decrease. Phase 3 started 6/16, started flat lining. Im super scared going start going sub pays attention data supports views.

The exact opposite here. Im closing watching data seeing bad things become ""mainstream"". Im hoping data starts go happening.

The fact Cuomo scared phase 3 NYC shows sees red flags data rest state also. Tesla really better. They've swatted least one refuse see Pyramids bad working conditions used build them. want Egyptian profit slave labor. think data inconsistent way makes drawing final conclusions difficult. agree texas relatively fubared. cannot conclude confidence bad Italy Yeah, people work also 30 - 35+ care. I’m trying ass believe might denial due fear. Reports immunity questionable best it’s easy cling would appear good news trying times serves absolutely benefit let guard down. Plus, daily new cases around 1200 mid June really started escalating. assume 2-3 weeks lag, daily deaths may end 200+ range long. ...A 20% death rate disease would likely end modern civilization know it. That's planet-wide healthcare collapse, tens millions dead secondary tertiary effects multi-country simultaneous hospital failure *alone*, global depression unlike anything we've ever seen, food infrastructure collapse, starvation, military intervention. total dissolution social order.

 Please wish things like that. That's bit dramatic. Even black plague passed. get back normal like five years. Seriously, true? Wow... wrong, we're talking 5% here. Deaths per capita could increase 10x next 3 weeks (literally impossible unless left field cataclysm occurs) still would half NY levels. It’s pretty much US Mexico Brazil India unless I’m missing anything Makes caMacho pretty smart r/Coronavirus truthers shambles Look Tesla's terrible history abiding air pollution regulations.

And no, ""something better nothing"" reason. might well put duct tape pecker fucking rando think ""something better nothing"" save STD.

Hell, could probably find 50% efficacy Brazil arm Oxford trial end July. believe total deaths per day US reached lowest level since March.

Source: live MA. reason places like New Zealand still quarantine 14 days even swabbing entry pre-symptomatic results much likely false negatives. worry might get tested early, get negative result, thinking ok go see people, actually contagious, develop symptoms quarantine others already infected. guess depends hoping toward end quarantine risky is, general, swabs false negative rate 20% (3 days symptom onset, peak test accuracy) best times, ideally everyone act like contagious (distance, wear masks indoors) etc regardless test results.

Of course, extra careful time exhausting, would probably relax little bit getting negative result, keep basic precautions. Mine profane essentially yes. Yes, exactly.

I Look back one better decisions That's it? I'll  way burn herd immunity. I'm advocating this, distancing mask usage prolong long us. going kill virus. what’s latest IFR estimate ? Yeah know thanks Possibly quick. remember reading something putting someone ventilator immediately wasn’t right response. could misremembering. Something like would change then. face picture uniform. Red cross it? I'm looking around website dont see anything. Although get entered contest win prop new wonder woman movie. neither but... wonder mask thumbnail reversible beaver interior side. mean CA much trouble AZ probably going worry making people quarantine could wrong. many deaths would be? interesting. live NYC, precise week - Feb. 22, fact - came crazy illness. Fever, intense chills, body aches - slept 12-13 hours woke next day feeling better. thought getting antibody test sure benefit I'd get stage. least keep family safe, freedumb may suffer recognize pain later survive through.

A years, live shame right thing. Yeah exactly. clearly asymptomatic God love movie. Nobody wearing mask live (the UK) infuriating. We're sleepwalking another national outbreak nobody gives shit. lives must sacrificed protect us change business model aspect normal day day business whatsoever wash hands take complimentary mask cannot refund last years tuition thought school enrollment, requiring vaccinations. doesn’t really anything hard make vaccine something. got pretty little mouth, don’t he? would guess hospitals achieved peak capacity therefore let less severe cases, however hospitalizations climb would let severe cases death rate % would climb. apt comparison would Florida, Texas, Arizona March 15 NYC capacity April 1 NYC capacity. rant drug would doubt blame government They're laughing us; looking us horror pity. might true. guess I’m basing opinion I’ve seen media. seem better, early shitshow. also saw lot people face face mask last night Portland. boss prime candidate virus wreck. 8 people family caught vacation, they’re fine. he’s convinced it’s democratic hoax.

We're basically state NJ -_- know happening? Especially since contact tracers cities like NY told ask contacts participated protests. fact matter ZERO evidence back claims protests contribute current spike cases. fact utterly ridiculous people trying assert densely packed crowds people yelling chanting protected cloth masks. would say people flying would selfish. Planes full people buying tickets. one thing, BLM protests generally kept moving throughout day. Outdoor generally safer, outdoor *and moving* even moreso. situation many parts Colombia. government says increased capacity getting lot overpriced ventilators (while universities developed cheap alternatives), there's one operate them, doctors even getting paid.  trump saying? That’s awful thing joke considering 100k citizens died it, mostly result inaction bungling. we're #1 we're WINNING. Don’t forget what’s going happen PPP runs out... lot people jobs right companies required keep part PPP loan stipulation. lot laid soon. Even know jobs right don’t even full time hours impact far beyond unemployment rate. again, anyone actually shocked this? HIGHLY contagious virus, many people asymptomatic. likely MILLIONS people already. Stay home feel scared. I'd avoid truck stops border. Don’t stoop low People produce droplets talk, almost much coughing according research. Taking mask talk like removing condom come. Yeah Um Thanks laugh! includes talks scientists, extreme position airborne transmission. scientific community agrees COVID-19 transmitted aerosols crowded indoor conditions... like ones UNC Chapel Hill announced. E.g.  example university (CU Boulder) adapting Fall reducing crowding classes 56 - 120 sq ft per person. Compare UNC Chapel Hill 9 sq ft per person. 

\- Even Skagit Choir outbreak (87% infection rate), could explained aerosol transmission, 30 st ft per person! Students emit less viruses singing, they'll lot crowded UNC

\- See blog post explores implications spacing Universities: 9 sq ft per person highest value considers, leads substantial probability infection.

\- Agreed tradeoffs, UNC Chapel Hill choice appears impossible justify, given evidence Nah breathing mask sucks. Doesnt mean shouldnt it. old people selfish entitled ruining everyone else's health. progress... enough. One day soon successfully eradicate Jets entirely. Shit remember March people said 10,000 would A) unconscionable, B) literally impossible flu there's new virus etc.

This? Meh! scratch. mere flesh wound! sides. would one day attacks effectively amount ""wow, took *this* long right thing show leadership."" entire focus masks pertaining president trump would end. suddenly followers would think masks 1. cool 2. wear one, anti-American unpatriotic.

And America would finally chance this. Trump losing self-proclaimed war. He's failure war-time president. Ok. compare Ebola vaccine. 

That took much longer. America really death cult. country built fending goes wrong. US even hit cold. imagine bad going get winter. Yes, still contagious could've infected others. Florida following suit well. late. take months least try curb it. masks mandatory, many months. world think would happen? Like...Disney world....happy, happy, happy! imagine numbers would stay down? lives drug induced state even, ever, thought would ok.

Don't elect again. shown much stupidity, beyond words! can...and everyone state dead dying, someone else take over. infrastructure there, get rid bodies. hope survives. dig holes bury body killed. form reporting individuals. personally know someone visiting state, report them. follow individual prove otherwise. can't good example, horrible warning. government England allowed social bubbles roughly 3 weeks now, initially 6 people allowed outdoor space house (e.g. Garden) social ‘bubbles’ allows instance go girlfriend’s vice versa stay overnight without social distance.

The thing though applies England.  4 countries UK following different paths now, Wales Scotland strict restrictions.

Edit: must add Leicester city England gone back onto full lockdown seems there’s going regional approach things whereas National approach point. Ah, yes, I’ve often longed 3/5’s compromise, elderly.

/s

Jesus Christ, exactly kind shit I’m talking about. would certainly serious matter child-rearing aged folks dying rate (in terms birth rate obvious “they whole lives ahead them” argument), exact callous attitude leading situation getting worse.

“Don’t take seriously folks, it’s elderly dying, don’t worry people getting sick, dying, suffering [lingering side effects many scientists fear could take years need taking seriously regardless attitudes surrounding age dying. It’s death that’s concern here, numbers dying taken lightly simply closer grave median population.

*That’s really shitty position hold.* Cornell private non-profit university. Word I’m sorry think replied wrong person It’s tropical climates. get flu year round. Man thread brigaded pretty hard. “When keep thing expect different results...” ok, downvoted oblivion enough one ever see sources. put sources original message, late now, bub. Gonna hard teams play 30%-50% getting sick season See comment, noted excess deaths kind pneumonia (roughly 1000 compared last year, official count covid Tokyo around 300 period), article also. Still quite limited deviation.

As Japanese, quick translation

\- Flu deaths 4 first months year : 65 (2020) vs 246 (2019)

\- Pneumonia deaths 4 months year : 4147 (roughly 1000 last year).  DeSantis's plan? nothing. Negative pressure great all, makes doors really dificult open Yes, talking need billions. staggered prioritizing happening beginning. starters, limited supply things like medical grade glass give us bottlenecks Killing oldies really help Trump.  Everything?? 😉 respect authority? Looks like ppl finding cringey. good night. definitely higher compared last Tuesday. LESS testing. Also, tried it. convincing evidence one gets healthier, sleeps better, poops better, skin heals, really good stuff like that.   

Since medical sycophant, perhaps answer this? flu season winter time? blaming wrong California-based Institute Health Socio-Economic Policy stated 2015 top 100 pharmaceutical companies by sales, 64 spent twice as much on marketing and sales than on R&amp;D, 58 spent three times, 43 spent five times as much and 27 spent 10 times amount [3].Mar 13, numbers tell countries fault, vs pharma companies wanting American population spend drugs like would new Playstation 

To nations mere concept advertising marketing prescription drugs insane Bye. First Rick astley getting rickrolled month this? time alive want ask hoaxer fake, real pandemic look like? would things look different REAL pandemic happened then? Yep. varied place place. I've seen pictures wearing masks, pulled chins. doctor strip club? find article. get point like wanted happen, way pandemic wear mask blame control say 50 ride car risk life every day. limiting immigration: bunch people getting it/spreading it/dying Mexican immigrants. 

I’m contact tracer; 1/3-1/2 cases require translator. don’t come anywhere close making half county population, unless there’s way people thought snuck recently (seems unlikely, based demographics see every day). Right, wtf!? shocked numbers gave, coronavirus kill people breast cancer. Wow. generate far revenue 99.9% people means seeing earliest deaths tiny increase first week, since reporting takes week reported yet. 

You see beginning Arizona page. Yeah, rebuttal needed. virus sensible give shit ready. interesting. discusses neurological symptoms identified young patients early January February English language conventional wisdom virus harm children.

I've distressed situation US I've sadly gotten myopic somehow blind suffering parts world. thought area smart enough lock Vietnam, NZ Singapore had. agree regarding nature protests - one group real, legitimate concerns society, group frankly juvenile reasons protest (I want haircut one stopping me).

I guess overall point virus care marching. spread global pandemic intensifies people close together - scientifically proven pretty obvious. take guess agree (and think chief medical officer NYC said twitter) ""r*cism real virus"". disagree - global pandemic, tens thousands people clumped together, irrespective cause, irresponsible dangerous. understand perspective? think flaunting dangers virus, simply attendance. science says - pandemic, gather large groups, protesters opposite, flaunting dangers virus?

Some honesty think really helpful. take would ""frankly, understand spread massively increase - care. try best mitigate spread protests, science afterthought - cause important stopping spread, support marches. flaunting dangers virus definition - science says group up, anyway."" would least understand position, although disgaree it. think marches protests wait global pandemic over.

But can't understand people said freedom protests March irresponsible flaunted dangers virus, somehow 1/2 months later, much larger mass protest flaunt dangers virus cause just. virus care nature protests, simply spread much easily.

Sorry rambling, take personally, guess really interested position matter thing, know... masks stuff adds fast unemployment paying people $200 week places.

Unemployment business usual, no? pays people % making. benefit # reflection income was. 


Honestly, $600 absolute overkill. need pay people making jobs, more, less, call day. 47,000... well, rate things going, America see 50,000 soon enough. 

I wonder over/under 100,000 number Fauci floated. rescaling expectations 50,000 seem bad? next try reset expectations 250,000 deaths? 500,000 deaths? million deaths? many repeat protests: usually one two big ones per city, people getting exposed standing around different crowds week later

Less taxes, less spending. Seems postulation pretty spot on. Since seeing clusters appear thinking thing. point going run US citizens. two simple things:

1. Show empathy people impacted virus economic fallout.

2. Step aside let medical experts lead.

He's incapable either he's sociopath always smartest guy room. honest q bc don’t know much public perceives statistics, haha. isn’t possible people know this—that testing rates going up—they easily justify wearing mask risky things, see another huge spike cases weeks/months? That’s definition bar. Selling alcohol food. Food necessity. Alcohol not. Pretty simple. people selfish. ...of electoral college.

FTFY Let's real would find way claim one wearing masks first time I've heard comparison, personally. claim left using mind control 5G towers brainwash hospital staff hospital empty.  Jokes people still getting laid businesses still suffering. said many times, Asian cultures tend collectivist whereas Western cultures tend individualistic.

Face masks really good case point, main protection provide passing Covid people. Yes wearing one also cut risk catching someone much. everyone wearing mask (and social distancing) reduced risk transmission much reasonably done. Oh no. No, all. barely contact tracing, one monitored make sure stay home.

Everything voluntary, enforcement, real pressure employers give employees sick time extra paid leave high risk people slow spread covid. businesses industries closed, way many people work, social safety nets things like paid unemployment housing assistance low cost medical care really, really terrible.

Did know required paid sick leave US? pass covid-sick leave legislation (for two weeks pay) - many loopholes doesn’t cover 70% workers state. employers requiring positive covid test claim - getting tested difficult months. don’t though, least hotspots like Houston, Dallas, Phoenix. I’m Dallas friends mine exposed qualify test don’t show symptoms, preserving people symptomatic. Many accounts people waiting days get appointment test, free sites closing noon days even cars started lining early 1 am.

Is true? 
What say validity antibody surveys use judge much immunity established? understand completely agree correct use word “fewer,” questioning logic people clearly aren’t using brains correctly. It’s entitlement correct answer. Hey allowed outside get essential supplies either. happens paint samples hardware store, candy Walmart, beer liquor store essential supplies.

Generate billions NCAA. people watch football. Risk dying. Sounds like hell deal.    Appreciate you. added playlist. yes. would go far say make majority voters worldwide. Damn, like seeing unicorn wild. swing voter? unironically waiting debates gonna consider whether Trump Biden would effective President? Nope, shit way eastern folks coming South support (and completely exhausted beat up). white knights scrubs coming. stupid?

Actual retrospective studies show France case community transmission late December, Brazil COVID-19 sewage back November 2019 - month China identified virus.

Given COVID-19 3 separate continents November 2019, stands reason global long China, Italy, Iran, US outbreaks months later. question would finally infect right person start superspreader event. love people working making far less 600 week? seasonal worker lose job September, feels unfair many make almost double weekly wage anything. helping supposedly deemed essential beyond Tallahassee Pneumonia deaths something like 400% Florida since February, there's lot discussion whether deaths categorized. Lol getting tired people saying shit saying month texas . possible see age people biggest factor. Nyc pulled biggest fuck since Japan bombing pearl harbor sending covid patients back nursing homes .Texas Florida California real leaders matter hard wish death numbers match new york happen. plans place kill innocent people unlike nyc new jersey . Bars open Toronto? forgot part CEO TMC decided stop reporting data things looking bad. different. Assuming wealth levels somewhat comparable, larger country proportionally resources available run vaccination program.

The main advantage Netherlands population density. exceptions, pretty much everyone within hour's drive away city decent size. That's case many parts US. there's reason urbanized areas US can't roll vaccinations pace Netherlands could, despite serve considerably people. Bullshit Classic summer flu season. Many people opposite. familly members survive,they take less seriously. fair *lot* morons here. tradition healthcare, education, COVID, foreigners roast US behind times Massachusetts take it. waiting us become example. Number fucking one! They've banned Norwegians passion Sweden, guess, least that's I've read. keep seeing stories like surprise me. Maybe good news because:

- Outdoors much safer.

- people protesting liberal politically mask-adverse.

- people protesting were, generally, move typically spend much time direct contact infected person.

- soon tell. know fact three DHS workers tested positive Little Rock one died month. hushing up. person got works them, rides elevators them, sits 2 desks over. Government hushing stuff big time. lockdowns

Health *public* whether like not. Lockdowns were/are meant greater good benefit *everyone*. **2 WEEKS**. 2 weeks would take. US population could stop selfish simply stay indoors **2 weeks**, would over. Look NZ. They're Corona-free. US complete turmoil though changing time soon people selfish lack ability think critically. shit frustrating us *have continuing* shelter-in-place. time leave apartment get groceries since February. I'm sick looking walls around anyone else, am, sticking guns trying avoid selfish tendencies want *everyone* able stay healthy, safe, resume normal lives quickly possible. **large** portion US population either believes Coronavirus real/not threat (it is) protesting (even noble cause like racial injustice) far important public health. We'd everyone selfish stupid. Yeah, I've seen lot people talking ""being allowed go back restaurants"". like, thing stopping fact government shut things down, pandemic. crazy way thinking, mad common. defend want won’t flying. Scary think much general issues around time around case 1918. 2.2mn figure number told would case dying COVID-19 US took action, right? 1918 flu death happened 2nd wave. Given coronavirus, may sort pattern perhaps different pattern? Developed 11 years ago, probably testing long before. I'd like see price analysis last 9 years compared now. know drugs take tons r&amp;d, much federal grants aka American tax dollars. truly helps covid, make money back 10 fold even reasonable prices. getting paid development, they'll get paid development cancer treatments. I'm profit, I'm exhorbitant pricing based current need. Medicine available need it, without bankrupting patient, especially patient helped fund project begin with. 

Now said, I'm sure goes far beyond expertise, welcome corrected. thing works ""average"" American reverse psychology? article begs differ. many reasons increase cases, reopenings one, main one, protests one forget numbers far accurate reporting done constantly changing too. Yes replies you, importantly data reported, CHANGES reporting procedures day (which info I'm sure anyone has).   think happens people worn mask whole time gotten sick getting people worn mask ever, quite impossible. Even right thing do, people would never vote Medicare even though, mask, would benefit well. tempting say risk whoever willing risk it. personally I’m take soon comes out. Given flight attendants getting sick presumably kept working first developed symptoms, feel like seen planeloads people getting sick *somewhere* world like [Air China flight SARS epidemic (another coronavirus).

Packing like sardines needlessly stupid think single person infect entire flight either. understand actual racism is? agree. That's mention blood clots. scary disease. problem blocking others help themselves. keeping ingredients secret rest world? Gilead multi national corporation. could disclose ingredients outsource production vendors foreign countries. Europe understand administration's deeds led point. stupid.  Seriously, area. Midland/Odessa people still wearing masks. Less 25% that’s plus/minus 15%. Every caller hear radio morning, 4 hours straight, masks, needed, overblown, blah blah blah. Ps. checked today,but believe Covid floors 3 hospitals 90%. it’s haven’t checked, numbers Monday-Wednesday-Friday now. initial comment stated “I don’t think it’s given protests caused significant rise cases,” different “these protests spreading disease less reopening.” agree reopening likely played role, much, I’m certain. Yeah, figured remembering CDC's earlier estimate 1-14 days. Pretty much every source says 2-14 days now.

Onset flu usually much quicker covid. allowed refuse feel uncomfortable around patient. Many people act sensibly, even without told. really need almost everyone wear masks.  majority people wait told something, it. people still waiting. 

We really need everyone wear masks, including people still waiting told. Except well resourced kids (rich parents take time ability teach kids, computers internet, etc) aren’t going fall behind way. Sure might missing random stuff, it’s big difference interacting teacher zoom several hours day highly educated parent nudge things find things catch interest trying worksheets parent’s cellphone camped McDonald’s parking lot whenever parent find time take there, don’t background knowledge time try teach whatever you’re learning. 

It’s also simply making everyone another grade school fix everything. Kids forget learn focus lose interest learning focusing. Relearning boring frustrating children, makes even harder teach them. It’s also going pretty hard get kids value education we’ve showing value less pretty much anything else.

I think it’s notable mention starting university year later — it’s college ready likely issue, it’s kids struggle get high school get college fail don’t appropriate math (and other) skills. Studies showing testosterone man higher likelihood cytokine storm. think guys steroids? right across street house Atwater Village. upper middle class progressive neighborhood, bernie warren signs abound, still people act like complete trash humans comes masks. deandre whats gonna change that? looking forward rest week. increase coefficient holds (1.854% increase), looking 10,200 tomorrow, 9,200 Thursday, massive 16,500 Friday. 

I really hope I'm wrong. feel like maybe large increase saw last week *maybe* people taking seriously, would help reduce increase week, again, lot already baked in. take correlation it! buy box bandaids 3 bucks, 50 doctor? There's reason buy sad excuses anymore. time America grow start acting like big boy country. ideal positive rate 5%, we’d need 2 million tests day. We’re nowhere near that. Let God sort 'em out, right Guvna!!?? numbers (but not) throw country crisis. see crisis necessary, experience crisis already, necessary develop new, fundamental thinking address things are. Fundamental shift needed. Trying put fires end stage work. proven clearly predictably. 

The necessary, fundamental components change order three basic areas: nonharm (and nonviolence), thought (how think, epistemology, etc.) action (how take action, understand action, etc.), well combined. 

Basic work clarifying, unfolding explicating meaning basic things, well maintaining managing inter-constitution possible needful. anyone would like, I'll go example per thinking matters. is, realize, bit odd way go this, maybe I'm bit odd. think people subreddit know graphs work. Sweden country whose schooling curriculum covers graphs. issue FHM making clear backlog corona statistics page.  True R0 measles substantially higher covid19.

We need order 95% penetration measles vaccines, covid19 likely around 80%, maybe bit less. He's probably testing negative weeks. Kate Garraway's husband UK coma since March he's covid-free weeks point. done much damage organs may never wake up. Looks like similar case here, he's tiny bit luckier. He's fighting covid more, he's recovering damage did. survivors guilt

That would require conscience empathy, seemingly absent anti-mask crowd. flu novel virus. virus flu all. comparing them? They're totally different viruses totally different diseases. Depends want conclude results comparing to. vaccine seems immunogenic, say much. snort household dust, going immunogenic well. guy Brett Weinsteins. That's true. normally would one protesters. protest started virus TL. Ppl bars, ect.

Most types ppl virtue signaling bored. saw white girls twerking middle street, ppl tailgating lol.  let’s real, way he’s letting country get infected is, deserves value providing better vaccine world market still trillions dollars. see every well regulated market fail produce multiple vaccines coming years perform variety different criteria. mention publicly funded research development.
This 50% criterion seems like arbitrary round number, could strict compared optimum level. Unlikely. little spread. hell people pull masks talk? fabric, idiots. capture words eat them. really people desensitized much mentality. People panic long happen them. That's what's happening country. city hit 100k cases friends going road trips stuff. always excuses like ""I'm going crowded place"" ""I come contact anyone"" etc. long happen someone close take seriously. Mind friends people talking staying home staying safe month ago cases less 10k. Yea mean that’s great. take walks slide I’m coming across someone else. Everyone wearing em everywhere see. Guess it’s making difference know season can’t complain money right next year year after? swear players worse trump times Thank you! ;) way! classy resort town like Laughlin, I'm shocked. dunno dude, lot companies fail phase 1 trials go belly explains deaths/1M, deaths/cases look high well: 

NY 7,66%

NJ 8,47%

USA 4,77%

World 4,87% use congress buildings football stadiums. NYC learned first attempt snitch line, see.  Ezekiel Elliot Von Miller virus March (ETA: Zeke April) still well enough practice. They're young healthy. That's great get trouble taking clients. got trouble broke noncompete clause contract.

There's nothing inherantly wrong, remotely criminal taking client base leave company. got criminal record civil breach contract. something else break law. box says: trainingmask performance breathing trainer 3.0 article compares city city see protests correlated increase not. Generally, didn't. US cases whole up, there's evidence protests driving factor. actual driving factor would re-openings people take virus seriously going bars whatnot. far dangerous people go protest otherwise conscientious spreading virus. friend went Lowes said park parking lot across street full. Poor guy pipe break kitchen like optional trip could noped of. I've using excuse procrastinate everything lol OMG solved COVID!

It’s like BLM mural outside Trump tower. achieves nothing whatsoever. Thanks useless. symptoms days beginning I'm good. Body aches, headache loss taste smell. 
Thank asking honestly understand mindset people wear mouth nose

It's effort comply law breathe time. youth-skewed subreddit understand difficulty older people breathing mask.  placebo effective all, give everyone also /s ""Coronavirus 5G mixed chemtrails vaccines."" Miami-Dade, LA, Maricopa (Phoenix) Harris (Houston) counties putting numbers like week two now. 

Those epicenters they're experience New York did. They're less dense, theory able flatten curve faster, also people taking seriously, we'll see plays out. Admiral Giroir brought Senate hearing today. Current testing approximately 560,000/day. Target testing capacity September range 1.3 million - 1.7 million tests/day.

(Source: ) US like people bought entire stock handsanitizer. forgot everyone needs wash hands / take medicines stop global pandemic. Yeah I'm line thinking too. way crowds higher risk got lucky. 1. Yes. patient asymptomatic develop noticeable symptoms. possible symptoms covid-19.
2. know yet. lots theories. One theories gaining lot steam people contracted different coronavirus last couple years gave bodies sufficient juice basically fight covid-19. There's evidence coronaviruses caused normal colds (about 20% common cold viruses coronaviruses) cross-reactive covid-19 means people may already built-in antibodies allow fight disease. know. Children also often asymptomatic know either.
3. unlikely die asymptomatic still may side effects. Many asymptomatic patients still lung damage CT scan. children even young adults post-viral Kawasaki-like syndrome popping covid infection. could small number people asymptomatic infection end getting post-viral illness related covid.
4. I've read understand mechanism. valid question. hope people worked hard everything could get people take precautions happy. lot people going die greed ignorance. would add banning immigrants,

He's never owned mistakes......

First admit wrong take accountability mistake cost lives.

Then we'll start listening again....  beaches going closed throughout California ones open going see ridiculous crowd. ones closed going see share people sneaking too... gotta protest lack freedom America. Two weeks sounds pretty safe. knowledge way disease spreads still rudimentary. Seems unlikely find evidence net COVID-19 case growth differentially rose following onset Black Lives Matter protests, even modest evidence small longer-run case growth decline,” study Jon Thogmartin, Tampa Bay area medical examiner, told WFLA earlier week appears virus hard time transmitted big observer empirical evidence. Look New York City’s numbers. gone up. happening New York City? They’ve protests. people streets, social distancing, right other.

The mask thing happened long time ago. never get sneezed stranger it'll soon. Lol. dealing 300 million people say “people xyz” it’s always true. question is, many people believe paying attention? Pray toads join garden! epicenter NYC. rest country shut bit people see worth people really dying. spelled fuck'em weird. Caution: low human n value 40, don’t report n value studies mice. skeptical. obviously working SARS-CoV-2 vaccine longer known exist.

Unless... Bill Gates good again! **GASP** /s even take us? now? could understand 3-6 months many cases. Save ur life. Ur life matters Well made silly comment disproven Since high-profile expert, outlandish think able assign degree permanence accuracy statements, media poor job communicating nuance - even try. Even so, I've seen quoted saying vaccines possibly late 2020/early 2021 (or ""just matter when""), warn may never vaccine, warn dire consequences say shake hands again, say 2nd lockdown necessary, often times within week days.

If assess everything comes mouth objectively argue technically contradicted absolute level. can't deny confusing, believe changes result educated conclusions new information. credit, perhaps says people choosing report way reported. E.g. Fauci says ""A vaccine end 2020 possible, remain careful vigilant sure thing"", one side hears ""Vaccine incoming!"" hears ""There may never vaccine."" anything helped managing post-viral stuff? There's ton people reporting similar issues beating COVID, tough illness. Look data. Deaths steady decline since April definitely cases permanent damage. girl 20s total lung transplant Northwestern Chicago couple weeks ago.

It might (always even usually) cause permanent damage, know definitely *can*. person knows significant relationship anyway, person also blame. bar owners tolerating customers ignoring social distancing precautions, that's them. That's nonsense. Sources? No? Move along, thank you. called *hoax*. need stop referring ""wave"". *We* spreading virus. ""happening"" us. Apologies, meant say *maybe you’re superspreader*. look ""Lucky"" listened. ""ok"" here. 🇨🇦 far..... 
Without vaccine, we're even halfway. wont know halfway untill over.. Wave 2 happening around world, supposed worse one. friends relatives US, aint done round one yet.... gives appearance? testing capacity that? Troublesome coming Fauci tends tell truth. makes sense. Make em work little harder harvest data. MUH FREEDUMBS surprised seeing Red Newport Beach BlueGold Huntington Beach. 2 places cater douchey spendy crowd includes bunch people believe rules apply them. actually understand Tozo framework, would understand comment Thank NightStriider good luck. still wud u risk 90% pop 1 go, would risk anything matter 90% pop 1 go? 2 billion doses september can't wait see rest world manufacture drug tell US fuck off. Oh yeah, sure. Let downvotes commence! Americans spoiled brats. Apparently need pain. require mask order wear one? stay 6ft one another? mask orders still plenty people wearing them. Easy blame politicians harder admit you’re country full idiots. even means? when's purge coming? I’m genuinely curious, someone help understand plummeting death rate though? cases massively spiking, everyone acting like worst news earth, undoubtedly good. daily total deaths dropping super steadily, we’re 12% amount daily deaths compared peak daily deaths early May. seem celebrating that? 

Are worried many new cases overwhelm hospitals death rate go back up? I’m genuinely curious Arizona's spike insignificant compared Florida.

Florida 3x many people AZ. last day, FL 5000 new cases, AZ 3000. New cases per million people 423 AZ, 240 FL, 170 CA. Stupid science bitches couldn’t even make smarter even need buy anything. wrap old t-shirt around face. ""Daddy, make time go faster!""

**""There reason anyone walking around mask on""**

\-Anthony Fauci, March 2020 July 4th weekend make break whether push hospitals past brink not. Even happens, protestors type take virus seriously, go home afterwards self quarantine afterwards. way, end spreading virus far less normal Joe go protests instead lives life normal constantly infects people work, school, grocery store, public transit, etc. Apparently Greed, profit, money.....before lives. 

Fly n Die

Edit: Downvotes? ....must middle seats. ever find ibuprofen actually bad seems like would work well covid version truth? really explain there's difference incomplete data *no* data? Smh. Oh wow died lung antivaxxer textual flesh. Well even test everyone, soon leave test site exposed anytime. Biden leads seniors. Trump losing litterally every single demographic except white males college education. long, wordy. target audience message would check reading enough it.

Wear mask GTFO would better sign people. See, told truth first place, perhaps legions people clinging statement ""mAsKs dOnT wOrK""

That lie one destructive lies ever muttered government modern history. we've said lot them..... brink homelessness? rival vaccine company whose boss hates Inovio loves reddit. interesting- dedicated infrastructure? buildings used things? Madness.  heard somebody say (pre-pandemic) wife go eat two three times week, finds relaxing somebody serve food. Personality-wise, tool. server validates sense superiority. people won’t consider eating restaurant currently safe. selfish emotional needs take much space heads. strings would be? way able function going forward vaccine gets 90 percent population takes right safety measures wears mask going public. Otherwise forget it, we're going end going circles repeating cycles. People going go stimulate economy people around dropping like flies getting really sick dying matter much governors try make happen. yowza would say awful thing? say emergency paragliding? said society’s number 1 objective eliminate risk make sure everyone stays “safe”, things like paragliding would prohibited. Sugar (which ingredient almost everything days causing heart disease diabetes) processed foods would prohibited. Automobiles would banned (except emergency essential use).

These things would prohibited pose dangers health.

But aren’t prohibited. that? It’s humans tolerate risk. Life would pretty shitty without risks.

So, point, humans say “this risk coronavirus worth social distancing rest lives”, go back socializing one another.  think people really forget country looked like shut first time. massive swathes infected people across country. Hospitals filling except hot spots, (like said) shut *anticipation* looking like Texas currently looks.

We somewhat successfully cut infection pass taken proactive steps *worried* big chunks country looking like currently look.

This time we'll shutting already fucked knows long it'll take places like Arizona finally admit reality exists. going bad. noooooooooooooooo dont wanna come pillow fort! mommy noooo! forget John Bolton fuckin' book. researchers high Ivory tower lost touch reality. Run red light. much think fined even first offense? Even there's cars around. I'm pretty sure going lot closer $200 $15. extent, it? reason wealth treatments drugs profiteering system. disallow profiteering drug, remove incentive develop treatments companies involved. voluntarily make loss waste time drugs expect return investment. profit system huge success overall.

I understand seems attractive force work gain, short sighted hard make case pandemic like exception. drugs important someones health life, pandemic drugs way special sense. Even worst pandemic going make even dent human population. worst aspects controlled simply quarantining care homes elderly, wearing mask, taking good care hygiene. Nations also afford drugs, problem there. problem lack supply, causes bidding wars, since enough go around. Generic drugs function pressure valve, they're cheap, hard work invent drug, generics enough support research production new drugs. Nah it’s pretty great CDC, evaluated antibody test cities mass testing done found 10x many people covid reflected ""confirmed"" cases. makes death rate 1/10 is. Death rate actually around .5%, 5%. definitely worse flu (.2%) much drastic. Really? see/hear news Covid every day NW. live Idiocracy now, people think loony opinions valid peer-reviewed science. I'm saying statistically relevant n=40. assume flu causes permanent damage, would covid different? Nothing first comment replied bullshit first off. factual statements. 

And yes, letting people die name profit **quite litterally** evil Protesting covered right right free speech.

Staying inside prevent spread COVID falls purview public safety. 

The stay home order done protect people state, state barely complied it.

The protests done change broken corrupt policing system, would occurred regardless Cooper restricted not. 

Cooper done level best protect citizens state, citizens state done level best whatever fuck please regardless. 

Don't blame Cooper; look mirror, look neighbors, look citizens NC. Yeah. fav sports MMA soccer. UFC done well. think might even enjoy without fans hear much wouldn’t ordinarily hear. I've seen tl:dr bot somewhere around here. Seems like need it. Dumbass fucking morons I'm hotspot city TX. moving FAST. friend nurse says hospitals filled fast past week. They're basically call days point. even talks prepping temporarily convert AT&amp;T Center (arena Spurs play) Covid unit. That's story US though occasions wife gone restaurant, tipped extremely well. feel bad wait staff aren’t earning tips. mods absolute threat public safety point.

We cannot discuss policy politics.

And cannot discuss informed consent of... reasons unclear. far way go fit agenda? Can’t admit large gatherings cause spreading? Coronavirus doesn’t care political leanings, get misinformation sub. Phase 3 efficacy. OK, like alright bars open time act fool! sure, Manchin easiest example highlight mess. supposed keep eat put back done eating, think anyone really ready leave.

But taking mask kinda kills point mask, granted releasing less potentially infectious particles air reapply mask, rather restaurants open outdoor dining option. Copying comment another post. Pretty much ideal conditions super active hurricane season Atlantic. another storm forms July 11th set record earliest E storm record. 2005 season saw Emily July 11th turned Cat 5.

The current Atlantic MDR ([Main Development SST' (Sea Surface Temps) like 4th highest ever time year. 2017 season behind 2005 season.

I really scared also kinda excited living west coast FL  Agreed, restaurants closed down, also, right now. No, they've turned markedly worse places. However, interpret realistically. 

The graph, like other, constant decline. little bumps. time, still net decline. forecast graph shows slight upward trend end, yet still net decline overall, default takeaway ""deaths going up"" ""it's graph graph"". *Laughs*

[Oh wait, serious. Let laugh even harder, soon peters sad strangulated sobs*

Let tell you, talk patients seem get it. Mostly.

But go store, angrily yell back.

There's hidden population see give flying fig unwilling see reason. backyard barbecues grandparents neighbors...

This already happening. know grandparents family this. absurd. guy brought Trump Wrestlemania. Assuming history classes this. still don’t know winter going like. There’s still risk civilization could collapse. Yeah I’m despairing :(. wish anywhere else world right now. 

I live south Florida. There’s mall called Sawgrass. People come world fill empty suitcases cheap American shit. Soulless consumers exist every nation. guarantee pandemic not, people come. country, kids become Meme sure you‘re arguing man. 7 day average tests 1 week ago: 518k
now: 592k

Clearly part increase cases attributed increase tests, can‘t argue that. Lies misinformation indeed. I'm one who's going get bitten ass though. Time friend. brother law ER doctor largest hospital system Michigan. prescribing dispensing required. It’s unsupported fact countries higher immigrant populations per capita much lower Covid cases deaths Sorry, lamenting fact death rate lower? bright side, people get hospitalized die eating fish tank cleaner drinking bleach helping flatten curve people refusing wear masks. genocides shocking nothing is. think time politition stay medical matters unless implementing medical personnel recommendations fellow Texan here. need someone talk let know. gone away? Sometimes sleepy funny Comparing deaths per capita two places entirely different places infection curve makes sense all. cases going 5K-8K/day, substantial proportion cases going result deaths next months. 

It's like people simply cannot wrap heads around lag time cases deaths. talking Florida finally decided make covid hospitalization data public? would say idiots don’t wear mask/ fail social distance/ go close-quartered activities strangers etc. shouldn’t considered good Americans remove gene pool. Seriously, country failures humans? Good. forces sure. like not, selfish culture exists world, especially States. must winner, stepping people reach point considered normal. Developed technically yes. Socially ??? Norway half population Sweden

we’re done Sweden amazing lately too. Almost deaths past two weeks. can't help notice quiet media experiment turned raving success. jerk thinking coronavirus. Yeah, US colleagues overheard rolling eyes. Water flowing underground Don’t forget still “climate change debat”...... Someone needs go visit neighbor again. Remdesivir IV medication. count day also schools across country schools open. Parents send kids school knowingly sick time. record, 100% agree Newsom's decision close bars slow coronavirus.

It's secret post coronavirus plans almost certainly involve going back bar, getting drunk sleeping attractive women (the look fake outrage conservatives' face hilarious).

But mean time gotta put pat help stop pandemic. Bavaria? think slept long. fan party admit Söder outstanding job. proof is, ironically, donkeys country upset government - think Corona real threat hit hard poor souls countries *thanks* government. Yeah pushed back enough cases uk. gone Brazil, waiting results know already started manufacture vaccine, risk taking Obligatory:  Ha! Trump bought *himself.* People never see distributed popular use. Hospitalizations going up.  ICU beds running low. US surging states didn’t shutdown completely and/or reopened early / aren’t enforcing face mask regulations. Additionally, NY state peaked 11k cases per day. several months lockdown. FL TX already hit around 8500 cases per day still haven’t shutdown.  isn’t testing. Look data. Take global pandemic that’s killed 130k Americans seriously.

It’s July still deniers there. Smh quit job Trump humper anti mask boss. Cases going state again. Entrie family chronic illnesses get gonna die. money best ive made years still worth killing family wanna go bars restaurants anti mask.  Remdesivir shortens time respirators like 9%. 5$ steroid gives 35% better chance survival. know push this, insider trading. Youre either nuts trolling, cant tell. Japan here. Whenever prefecture reports even single case, get concerned. president people serious discussions would happen decided stay White House lost? blows mind guy like could get elected. correct Phase 4 starts vaccine least 3 weeks phase 3. Useless agree least US best again... weeks ago looked could lose first place. Must talking stock market. us plebs. Yeah coz obviously conclusion kids going die Corona virus what's point vaccinating chicken pox ya dead anywhere, got people careful interested science way ""there's thing Corona, machine trying control us"". Perhaps previous exposure similar virus. agree you. someone living Ontario, Ford Trudeau handled things well circumstances. Oh agree shutdowns same. talked twice week family Italy Germany experiences. never going live larger house garden explore without issues. Every single family member small apartment access small balcony. Normally, European grocery stores much smaller make difficult maintain social distancing. almost like different circumstances require different responses!

For us, work non-essential national infrastructure supposed stopped. truly happen. E.g. stores stayed open sell guns, ""essential"", home construction considered "" essential"". Neither really essential, frustrating see us suffer, people trying get ahead stupid technicality. wrote stupid individualist people. line thinking going make situation much worse gets better. 

But factually incorrect say never went lockdown. Many people posted reasons mortality rates gone down, keep large numbers, hospitals able admit treat patients. see mortality go back up. Texas seen whole lot Europe it, Germany released statement saying well supplied expect continue be. Florida Texas driving almost exclusively ok need get word out, bad Florida, really bad. Reading mindblowing. us living US even worse. also mind numbing cause used imagine 1% US population virus NYC (2 3 million), antibody tests showed 20% population owner company back, policy make sure guests masked, masked properly. 

Fortunately, guests total pieces shit, comply. forget mask mistake cool, bring order outside them. Or, they're regular, provide one stash. 

We someone ""re-open"" organization try come without mask, made big stink teammate. Fortunately, best person could make stink outside store.  might one silver lining -- screwed medical system badly, US almost choice enact proper single-payer system. Damnit Paywall It’s hype. Deaths still down. Oakland fine? talking farther East Bay? Bit late, blockchain company trying that?! Well found far scary pretty easily studie showed covid permanently change Hormon production men. Even mild symptomatic cases. changes could mean become permanently infertile. might much future generations feel sorry us.

Here blocked Chinese government almost instantly found internet... death counts continue stay low? much Abbott lying many people dying covid?? death rate 3 weeks ago cases started sky rocketing, deaths shown data now. EVERYBODY VOTE!!!! least leave help us get lesser evils please please pretty please point answering OP's question. asked RECENT INCREASE cases due testing. not, positivity INCREASING recently. made strawman, me. i'm sure *someone* blame China. Oh dearie me, could possibly done? Germany Colleague says thing. counting everything Covid-19 that's reason case numbers high that's take seriously. exactly would “have it”? isn’t war mongering country waiting invade wasn’t big bad USA. comment childish delusional antibodies mean immunity though. Antibodies clear body disease, mean protected obesity...  make way living wage America. ""figure survive""? What's secret?

And surely cancer qualifies ""one foot grave"". I'd like see statistics claim anyway. missed chance using automod terminated. U...S...A... USA! USA! USA! Certain segments population yes indeed. come conclusion crazy. Anti mask wild ass BS. wonder things went wrong (1981) voted red sake party policy, must look within yourself. Pulled measles polio though. Oh cuz pretty feels nice. Um odd. cost living varies tremendously region region tho ""special relationship"" :(~ Can’t pull bootstraps? /s 700,000 week would devastating. 6 days old point. 

And think pretty important days.

I hope view would different now. 130k “So far”

Also, think interesting report acknowledged became clear March 2020 many foreign-born people amazed large majority native-born people supported government's attitude, many cases public debate suppressed. created stress anxiety,

Yeah, ""suppressed"" gentle way putting it. look every single damn one posts: mass downvoting, Swedish trolls engaging targeted harassment ad hominem attacks, etc, etc, etc. I've got easy compared foreigners actually go protest street (they often get spit (which frankly bioterrorism pandemic) vile abuse shouted them) DARE go public space Sweden wearing, GASP, facemasks. get coughed on, mocked, people deliberately invade space, sometimes beaten.

The state shut down, people freaked, long lines toilet paper. people kinda settled realized take seriously. Gov. ordered business must require masks people need social distance much possible. think people accepted new normal.

This Virus going run course people can’t stop working. wash hands, wear mask around people public slow need ICU beds. Strap covid while.

Once again, another reminder we're own. Make decisions accordingly. Fauci *was* wrong.

April 9, also says American public's embrace physical separation restrictions sharply reducing projections death toll respiratory final toll currently ""looks like 60,000 100,000 200,000""** U.S. officials previously estimated, Fauci said.

The US already 129,000 deaths we're getting started. War End Wars said. 

20 years later Nazis seizing control Germany savagery humanity visible see. Google need socially distanced bumper sticker.  New York pretty good wearing masks using PPE. spike learned it. yet old enough ""fuck it, I'm going die anyway"" mentality

Time use fireworks incoming travelers Well answer obvious economic resources available rich verses poor. working ppl move generate income since they're human capital limited concentrated around service sectors jobs, inevitable they'll become vulnerable..

Personally, think society based UBI rather traditional safety nets see much better model handling crisis including pandemic. UBI allows people hunker limit mobility much possible would expect gap health outcomes pandemic rich n poor wont drastic, Sweden developed countries.. understand reason behind closings. hopefully smoke fireworks bbq help prevent spread coronavirus What's minimum age expect personal responsibility even inconvenient?

A days back though projecting tap sustainable surge capacity one day, made sense given announced 100% utilization next day. projected would begin dipping unsustainable surge capacity 12 days, think time would put around July 8th. didn’t really clarify part unsustainable, would imagine staff would give first, unsustainable surge capacity means “we give bed, maybe even vent, one look you”

I would love go dashboard find projection, removed replaced weird PowerPoint slide good things going. matter political leaning, people respect real deaths!

My brother friend 9/11 denier want scream matter circumstances behind people lost lives TRAGEDY stop detracting that. think society based UBI rather traditional safety nets much better model handling crisis including pandemic.

Unless live ice bridge Alaska, everyone enjoys vegetables rolling eyes you.

As example buy package 8 pizza pops $5 (in Canada). eat 2 sitting; 4 sittings. like $1.25 sitting.

On hand made large salad day. made 3 sittings. $0.37 carrot, $0.26 quarter red onion, $0.40 quarter cucumber $1.25 half head lettuce, $0.83 nice tomato. $3.11 divided three sittings *$1.04 per sitting*. added salad dressing can’t math I’ll extra give $0.10 serving. $1.14 vegetables compared $1.25 garbage.

I guarantee you’ve never actually sat done math would know you’re wrong. spout fat party line give excuse. Unless live rural Alaska, vegetables available year round. you’re truly still concerned price get old tote bin effing dump, pipes old bubble making machine old fish tank grow hydroponically.

There literally excuse eating shit except “I want to”. hey, want to, good you. that’s you’re doing. You’re making excuses blaming money can’t bothered math. don’t want eat healthy can’t bothered.

And side note, I’d happy send effing pic grocery recipes don’t believe me: People give crap :(

Welcome 1984 Sounds like want population density map county. Tons em google. 100% accurate 50% time. went store (NW PA) maybe 50% people wearing masks. Maybe 25% wearing properly... Unfortunately, plenty convention still here. shiny lights rally part Jacksonville.  COVID awful juggernaut Muh fireworks! Hey, you, garbage human being.

This saving lives.

How quietly quickly go find sharp object stuff ass. people get... look numbers think, OK, bit worse flu, maybe 5x worse, seems like something maybe cope indefinitely, surely? I'd agree, going life completely normally entire time, rather 2 months lock-down 2 months reduced economic activity, spectator events, large gatherings like weddings/funerals/parties etc. 

This virus extremely contagious, much clear. Imagine sports stadium full people say like 50 people COVID going in... many walk COVID? 500? 1000? night night? That's one sports stadium... many bars/nightclubs/concerts/non-professional sports, etc caused similar levels spread night night? can't sustained, virus means life normal find far viable treatment, truly effective vaccine... maybe, many years, enough people get gain levels immunity becomes lot less contagious actually open back normal being, truly, 5x worse flu. still sucks live long-term... do-able..  cAsEs last week, companies, including AstraZeneca (who making US market), still panicking supply ins't going here. government set three year long contracts increase production. Every single time hear types things. employees making minimum wage immune. ever cross mind maybe real racist? Let’s make clean 12 weeks. make across state. close borders. boom. light actually beat thing. Pogo stick go massive amount, close something short time means go tiny bit, reopen back ton. 

Not gonna help much. Close shit down. Make serious dent new cases. none read article instead post speculations? saving time activities not on governor's closure list: Churches, gyms, retail stores, nail hair salons. wonder means campers wear mask now. think people get ready possibility won’t able Christmas, nobody ready people going give safe cases going get way worse whatever point ""have heard term - prime pump - came couple weeks ago"" right. said years back coworker today, “It’s virus can’t avoid it.” :( so? Confirmed = LABORATORY TEST.

Those ones reported.

Presumptives counted... they're tracked epidemiological tracking purposes (explained that). thought viruses circulate population long enough, replication corrupts ways make less effective making one sick die? isnt you. people need money dont jobs. I'm unsure included thread, argument happy nothing's changed. Woohoo someone get cake. lot changed 19 plus million people. Earlier. November-December. They’re ramping production trials case works. Thank much spending time shining light bad faith Swedish Troll Brigade operates.

Yep. sparkling clear anyone who's paying attention. guess count influencing haven't. Thankfully many see exactly they're since they're exactly subtle. looking like we're hitting 51-52 actually, maybe even more. Texas Cali still reporting, hit yesterday's numbers we're 51k. Really? live Chester County rarely see anyone with*out* one. Granted, really go grocery store CVS, really rare see someone without mask. yeah, time see people social distancing there's sticker ground telling to. That's thing past. can’t fuck living cells insignificant dead cell barrier, bet isn’t effective killing corona compared actual uvc light.  Actual uvc doesn’t shine people probably way go now.    put album ""Alabama Pines"" giving listen now!

I feel exact way grew up. (Really small town Upstate NY) people don’t think gonna go back they’re stupid. mom nurse. Last night showed graphs covid patients. Things steadily increasing. early tell aren’t falling anymore, least hospital thought BLM protests peaceful? article hospitalized patients They're worst go by, including positivity percent, they're meaningless.... 

Example: 
June 24: 6177 7000 tested = bad 
June 24: 6177 100,000 tested = bad 
 
would nice include give clear picture. There’s asian people every Spanish speaking country. Lots Asian Mexicans way there’s Asian Americans. I'm honestly still trying figure ""freedom"" stops government mandating mask usage. simply exist. fantasy. Okay, responded conflate young adults kids? Like, millennials kids kids?

So really matter age group article taking about, someone asked consider millennials kids say yes, followed even patronizing ""Do kids?"" Like really?

Edit: let put perspective you. someone's child one point, people still refer ""kid""? years ago health issue related birth control implant. see 3 doctors someone agreed remove early. second doctor saw student health center. tried argue ""what would family think got removed early effort took get placed?"" think doctor would tried use family guilt trip keeping older? go doctor talk parents would think decision making talk like independent adult capable making decisions? death cult hoping healthy people locked down.

Rich people chance get used fact problems can't solved money.  unless anyone know dies COVID-19, probably learn thing this... I'm WAY anxious *stigma positive test* *actually getting virus* would argue I'm substituting actual evidence possibilities.

She claims Florida lying numbers, sets site ""true"" numbers, pretty damn close Florida's reported numbers.

It numbers saying blatantly wrong about, claim Florida's numbers mark wrong, seeing numbers similar (according OP, actually know true).

I know agree disagree him, looked all, point making, true lack discrepancy, valid. Reminds scene:
 right science far backs up. say nobody caught protest inside drinking air-conditioned space exponentially dangerous.

But keep denying science reality favor story makes feel better.

People say wearing mask like ""living fear"" may ""die respirator"".

Stay home weekend, please! going shit show. Fireworks worth dice roll landing somewhere COVID spectrum: death vs lifetime complications vs 'not hospitalized' flu severity vs asymptomatic carrier.

Stay home! can't (or won't), wear mask!! Maybe meant great uncle? 20, dad 45, great uncle 70, great great uncle would 95? possibility? Yes never said wasn’t. said it’s early make definitive predictions either way.

Americans devastatingly dumb selfish.

CA locked sooner state country. Nonstop telling (and mandating) people wear masks, wash hands, socially distance months. comprehensive phased rollout plan well-communicated. One robust testing plans (90k-100k/day). re-closed things like beaches ASAP people showed can't act responsibly.

Contrast astroturfed morons show statehouses weapons scream faces cops impunity threaten lives officials, he's threaded needle better almost governor.

He deal winners like stressed, well good luck. also could saved lives fighting civil war, right? quite cut dry. Wait weeks people get complacent forget. makes question going state. governor said uptick cases, things like bars close again. fully support true....but World-O-Meters dataset correct, really uptick also met criteria needing close anything again.

i want fact-driven decisions, whatever may be. Anyone else instantly think Toronto’s favorite crack enthusiast former mayor? RIP Texas also sub-national jurisdiction Italy national one. situation comparably dire. 

Yet. 

Still, there's excuse developed country failed bring control. managed to, except ones run unthinking populists. Right herd immunity eradication disease? feel like eradication extremely optimistic goal. could get around flu like levels infections, hopefully lower. could least go back normal would another disease tack every year. highly doubt Rona going anywhere. Man's smart. listen him. grocery delivery area? Northeast getting pelted helped remove TON anxiety. Still gotta sanitize stuff sure honestly still even go grocery store days. might worth looking into, honestly can’t careful comes COVID *especially* you’re living area that’s taking joke I’ve recently start wearing masks around 10 hours day idk much handle. face hurts find quite difficult breathe especially physical activities. find I’m frequently touching face adjusting mask defeats purpose. much sympathy respect medical staff years. Everyone lives far apart. go church grocery store. Yeah, that's right. ""Y'all dumb motherfuckers want key change?"" Hold person highest office land responsible. He's fucking charge! God damn it. Criminal trials take months. They'll fine time lock up. going back... even kills everyone!!!! yeah, good luck finding country accept American travelers time soon. Probably year, least. Possibly til 2022. (Though may countries start getting desperate tourism dollars) found mask washing machine.... safe use trash it?

If OK using droplet barrier, would sterilize oven minutes make sure safe use. thing is, people freaking heck out, people states (some friends acquaintances) even aware happening, taking precautions. virus killing people well decade. live music 10 years? Nah go freezing parts Canada lmao, already go school New England fuck I'm going somewhere even colder. I'm thinking like Victoria Vancouver since grew Seattle Pacific Northwest cities less identical. Even lot people taking seriously still grasp coming. Restaurants still open. Beaches still open. July 4th holiday weekend days away. Even completely lockdown tomorrow, we'd best two weeks even starting plateau - governor prohibiting local officials initiating lockdowns cities/counties. unreal.  Worse. America, spank child submission call 'discipline', assault &amp; battery adult. you’re right extent. Flatten curve mean slow spread that’s pretty universally accepted understood. point flattening curve avoid overwhelming hospitals. 

The rest mentioned mitigation tactics trace contact. got downvoted? numbers tracking downward weeks MA. I'd love hug mom Christmas. Literally person. thought arguement dumb. reddit, people chime whenever want. 

But real, critical thinking skills... c'mon. Appropriate username. Bye troll. know that. announce lockdown national scale gave like billion people 3 hours prepare night.... probably antivax too. Tell UK, lmao Honestly, best moments get tell entitled people. need checked. feel like worked companies prioritize workers. However also agree different comment customer service involve deescalation. that's usually training manager receives, front-line worker like Paris. day thread comments? Tennessee local here, doesn’t matter.

Most customer sites coworkers believe since deaths going up, something worry about. Except seen countless times immunity diminishes doesnt exist got it.

The chance reinfected high. death sentence since body basically decimated. check out. *Far*-UVC actually interesting. Seems promising, studies need done light cannot penetrate tear layer eye outer dead-cell layer skin cannot reach damage living cells body. Exactly long take people finally wake dangerous virus actually is? I'm saying dangerous - *that* dangerous. 

Yes, highly contagious respiratory infection serious effects unusually vulnerable people. beyond that, everything told COVID19 turned false.

We told virus would kill millions US alone, false.

We told lockdowns would make go away, false.

We told would locked rate new cases leveled off, false.

Not lockdowns violate many laws make mockery many Constitutions; deprive millions basic liberties; cost millions people jobs thrust world economy worst economic straits since 1930s — top that, sown untold misery around world, mushrooming numbers poor people experience [acute food shortages millions children face interruption [vital medical mainstream media beginning see facts. 

The truth, course, coronavirus didn’t cause hardships, least itself. Politicians *chose* inflict them. - thankfully - politicians beginning realise acting accordingly - despite keep repeating ad naseum - also copped fact Covid-19 *that* dangerous.  Sad Red Cross great decline since glory days Florence Nightingale

The failing around world politically correct turned Red Crescent appease radical Islamic terrorists.

Let’s defund Red Crescent make Red Cross great again!  speculated asymptomatic lacking symptoms virus attacked nervous system prevented automatic responses coughing.  go well. Murricans need meat Especially uppity church-y ho, I'm like....

Yeah. can't speak every state, seem report ""Total number people tested"" ""Total number people tested positive""  It’s nice see two people background sporting face mask/shield combo. google related terms find free article... care enough. I've noticed well. Honestly sometimes feel like im crazy wearing mask. One basic task much inconvenience average person global pandemic. tbh doubt alot people take seriously someone know died virus. personally affects someone know simply wont care Well could shovel m&amp;ms mouth mask on! here, I'm paying hotel room want town!  😬😬 ... understand recovery antibodies actually work! Lol Head Sand. Freedumb!!!!! True acknowledged all. Workers getting sick hurts revenue, Anyone got links better form fitted masks? Kind like ones typically see Fauci wearing? 

I bunch home made ones kind shitty pain ass. better ones order MLB shop teams like. 

I checked Adidas Banana Republic nothing orders canceled stock idea they’ll more. checking Amazon lot comfortable with. 

Where bought outside home made ones get yours? I've trying support al fresco dining BK neighborhood, though 3-4 restaurants immediately available. Aside wacky weather we've NYC lately, pretty nice. sure much love gets sticky hot, fine. 

I miss saddling bar chatting regulars newbies. Can't wait again. SOL tested early April took 7 days. places slow. Congress going vacation! health stock portfolio.... one, certainly someone's stocks. racist think go reported groom, engineer based Gurgaon, drove wedding Patna spite unwell family coerced take medicines go ahead rituals. treated Patna hospital diarrhoea, Covid-19 symptom.


I think means went hospital even wedding? Yeah that's serious question, fuck americans fucking stupid? scaring coronavirus. recovery hospital; recovery nearly anyone catches could suffer ill effects months end: I'm supposed feel bad someone makes 1K week? Lol joke, I'd love making that, even work it. Maybe needs cut cost living, maybe sell home get something affordable. make fine half that, I'm sure could figure something out. solution finds damn job figures live new salary. he's able rake kind money I'd assume sort skill knowledge could use. see government's job give *even more* theres people working making fraction getting fine. solution? Everyone get paid gov whatever salary undisclosed amount time cuz knows over? Vucks 7 cures everything! Jesus. could offer grand catch common cold take it. hate sick. imagine trying purposely catch COVID what's probably hundred bucks college-budget pot. Businesses AZ mortuaries time high. sounds like virus

Did actually positive test? seen those. lot ads Virginia Beach, too. Can't speak Ford/GM, Daimler BMW since know people working there. People get less work hours slowed production people keep distance. like people rush buy luxury cars global pandemic following recession. yeah... makes sense run production lines 100% anyway. 

Workers get paid sick even dumber let Covid spread inside factory. 

Spare capacities used produce PPE/parts medical supply. companies cooperating companies producing medical equipment. Yeah gives fuck enforceable not. Lots people put one ""mandate"" every person wearing one helps Put cart behind line it’s bumper keep stupid bay. right attend. decided go. also racially homogenous society makes big difference. company lot potential, leadership matters. erratic impulsive person leading company may able realize potential. Biden wins bet tons new articles nearly bad assumed. it'll kind fizzle die soon after. Interesring low death rate is, lie...would they? That's certainly fair statement. Cases skyrocketed deaths basically flat.

I agree hard discern based cumulative numbers official charts, look 7 day average numbers new cases/deaths, difference see numbers, there's marginal increase (from per day average 20 deaths low 25 now), nothing like increase cases. talking Fahrenheit Celsius here? pretty normal pattern abusive trolls, sure. 

What's normal using account spam one user trollish question multiple times row. Perhaps photo people wearing masks? SMH 99.9% survival

99.99% major conditions still see many people say, watch election disappear. Yeah ok said previous person cases started rise around 3 weeks ago going since. reckon we'll see deaths rise around mid end July. Also may mistaken think mainly young catching probably see deaths rise levels saw April/May. It'll probably modest growth deaths. Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance! *(all three)* was, admittedly, bit pedantic.
But people's 401K standing buy orders blend products include lots equities... likely fair say millions Americans bought (fractional) shares Gilead (likely without knowing it) last month. month. higher false negative rate positive solid PCR. made speak bulk many countries get vaccine soon approval got. Unlike he’s voted office November. Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance! *(all three)* Also got someone serving would even know? Especially large shop one dont frequent often Finally! that’s guest (morally guess). Legally wouldn’t leg stand on. lot changed since then. manufacturing risk, governments companies getting infrastructure place (US dramatically ramping syringe production, instance). Bright put whistleblower complaint, none things Yes, hospitals Remdesivir now. wonder make difference. high school then, invite high schoolers, one first non-college accounts. felt special

I also gmail beta account got would common username people try. Ordinary noun numbers. least prob got laid first time amount people lack basic understanding exponential growth staggering. Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance! *(all three)* Well, Georgia, elective surgeries going full speed ahead. governor refuses even think mandating masks executive order prevents local counties governments either. Even though beginning whole spiel “let area decide what’s best what’s best Atlanta isn’t what’s best Habersham Colquitt county”. Yet actively preventing happening.

Add fact hospitals across metro Atlanta furloughed laid experienced clinical staff, nurses doctors techs. So, no, don’t think we’re preparing. Even add surge beds, going take care patients? hospitals still say don’t enough PPE. Italy strict, point one friends even allowed walk apartment take trash 2 weeks exposure positive coworker. US never get level, concerned. 

This virus requires major self discipline sacrifice get control community. Unfortunately, don’t see something like 80% us qualities. comment may explain that. Actually, order was: “just take latex gimp outfit leave mask.” FREEDOM making $2400 state unemployment benefits. Pretty disgusting classic American. Zero investment fucks given prevention -instead people made lot money arranging looking forward monetizing investment sick start dying getting critical. Absolutely disgusting classic American move *were Dumbass Americans need research? turning away. People scared go. Numerous reports. Delaying reporting chest pain stroke symptoms bad   seems like two totally different guiding philosophies probably never agree this. Oh okay, see. affects positive rate? new cases day reported states actually new cases confirmation tests? It’s fault government screwed us over. saying SR state media? called ""conspiracy theorist"" referring way long ago. Noted. Yeah, I'm starting accept point likely catch whole family well. point best thing really start prepping body eating healthy, exercising, keeping immune system high level can.  Thank appreciate well wishes Correct! Cuomo excusing slow impose restrictions (and blocking mayor's proposals) saying explosion already built in. That's turning really case people rural settings believed well, falsely believed happened NYC would happen them.

Of course, defense, really hard understand coronavirus spreads exponential growth, range potential outcomes, long lag times infection hospitalization death. time anecdotal evidence catches up, probably shit show. Kind like wildfire. Seems containable far away burns half town.

And Cuomo operating bit blind lack testing. think bad job, still need take lessons NYC experience even though might hurt politician's future presidential aspirations.

Plus, many people honestly debating whether NYC (and European cities) different higher density reliance public transportation. COVID-19 established middle country think debate over. Welcome Florida: America's Control Group! arrest people terrorism charges this? Start that, let last long enough scare everyone else, drop charges long stay home save lives.

What ever lovin hell. Like always say, ""never trust 2020"" 600$ pretty controversial receives alot hate well. issue unemployed people making working really crappy jobs like fast food/grocery stores. guess alternative comes around pays everyone making certain amount/unemployed. pure 600$ I'll surprised see return (especially since government wants push everyone find job unemployment numbers look better reelection) Yeah, increase testing positive rate increases, that's really good. There's still internet, local newspaper(s) radio viable information. can't stand toxicity FB But, stock market time high!! EcOnOmy GrEaT! Sorry America world laughing guys stockpile hydroxychloroquine this. sounds like conspiracy.  FL enough said yet gets used shield protect current system like person replied did. employer provided insurance person article (which was), imply Obamacare getting repealed would make happened lady somehow worse? Either linked together non sequiturs deflection made. gunna lie, Robinhood looking pretty good lately.. however lungs aren’t since contracted fucking virus. Fauci served six presidents. knows Trump around forever better country, he'll tolerate regime change. friends physicians, nurses, EMTs say rough.  wish best. Masshole, always Masshole. They’re still one us :) ignore doctors, nurses, engineers, astronauts, research scientists helped develop Remdesivir UAB, gifted people graduate UA system yeah guess say kids lot people turned up.

No local epidemic cases rising bit disease extremely fatal.  excess deaths started shutdowns, though. limited locations shutdowns. issues mention real, they're different thing. It’s old Ass government official fuckers need die BC **don't** use memes'. Enjoy *naturalness* internet like generation born. Treating like equal citizens, amount respect empathy them, got here. Imagine virus 10x deadly. would literally kill us all. may well happen one day. 

Empathy them, trying keep alive, mourning loss *exactly* sort thing get whole family everyone love killed. 

Every single one idiots dies net gain society. one wont spread shit *real* virus shows up. fact allowed survive reproduce high numbers using crutch human civilization first place real tragedy here. MO post percent positive rate? Pretty sure folks think like plan pregnancies, experience them. think agree neither approach well considered. Start writing tickets 50k surpassed days. That’ll pretty big success though too. ideal would make huge difference spread NYC first - Italy was. enough information coming China Italy know hit them. NY acted well still acted late. talking people like NYC definitely going hit hard. good job would locked commuter suburb got hit hard. I’m originally Mass I’m proud I’m proud you. really miss people. Lol God lives Heaven.

Geez, guy.... Air Bud defense - thing used Ghomert distract hearings last week “the rules say cant make noise”.

These selfish assholes - embarrassing fuck American (always definitely worse past 4 years). delete button post  Wow, someone never learned civil discussion. shows much need schools open again.  Come back home. week 7,000+ dead  right, ""slowing spread infectious diseases"" ""preventing virus spreading population"".
Social distance means end, real core idea ""break chain communication.""
Soft lockdowns social distances guarantee people mild cases contact people.
This China records trains, planes, subways, shopping malls, supermarkets, food markets cases occur places low-to-moderate high-risk areas varying degrees containment, places confirmed patients, suspected patients, general febrile patients, close contacts separate isolation points hospitals.
Also, large number infections, people seem forgotten concept ""super-spreaders"".
As long dozen ""super-transmitters"" among 10%, number cases rise exponentially remaining 90% return work.
Viruses rise fall geometrically, know that's what's going happen. Go runs work home. Apptivity great trainer led workouts speakers. see (and do) chin strap lot trail runs... chinstrap one sight soon see someone pull up. Never leave inside within ~50 feet someone, cardio + mask = feel like you’re waterboarded. know risk touching face reposition mask every time pass fellow hiker/runner/mountain biker, point feel like know it’s containing germs. people generally pretty respectful general... woods least. Idk, polls take account voter suppression? last post-covid elections I've seen historically low turnout. think we're world there's much monumentally different previous elections, trust polls. think need vote. Like phonebank least. It’s really shock realize much people really don’t care killing people. interesting point. need re-evaluate way thinking, people like reason 125,000 people died far. Also, fucking cares old, old people people. Next time could kid underlying condition. viral load must high. really healthy infected badly. New York. Maybe week cases peaking deaths even easier see Italy.

Why different time? Yes! mean, maybe familiar jobs work, pay differently. can't tell every single one pays, rather certain pay somewhere minimum wage and, perhaps $50/hr. People skills probably near bottom scale, people specialized skills near top. pay significantly better someone make job Unemployment bonus wears off. sad people see common sense political. also understand demographic Reddit. appreciate everyone’s viewpoint listen. bring 50,000 people gathering protest trans BLM it’s okay private business owner literally trying save business people voluntarily going gym like protests, it’s get automatic downvote. continue use common sense, even argue I’m confident US full great people people want see others succeed. won’t buy narrative Reddit protests good people working bad. It’s choice whatever want, that’s beautiful great country. Haha they've talking shit whole time done this? understand China partly blame. Pretty sure leaders okay us dying pretend more.  Same. problem undesirable jobs food retail. Fast food trying hire since pandemic started. happens exposed other's ideas agree force think. worry, it'll pass get back reading agree you. partly true. mandate stupid many wear mask. didn’t beg though, someone else set lmao. didn’t ask this, didn’t ask even put position, didn’t ask national news, didn’t ask talked about. literally job people wanted support him. guy also using set community based dance/arts program good him. look hospitilization massive massive massive increase positive tests... starting creep past april/may peak. hospitals overloaded april/may either. 

The hospitals might become overloaded next week so, close yet. ICU used stuff, covid patients. deaths put based happened NJ reported. always keep data consistent. That's good point. people claim mask protect them... well ok protected then?! kind argument that?! Newsom make statement tomorrow enforcing stricter ~~lockdowns~~ *stay home restrictions*. People need stop damn selfish. 

What going take? Apparently well-being family.

**Edit:** Changed lockdown restrictions. Profit lie masks? mean research discovered new information wearing masks? That’s science works. NY already locked week article published. American Guatemala. 

Same here. 

Took son see pulmonologist today Multimedica. told virus literally everywhere now, went lament status health care system. He’s pediatrician said he’s seen lots cases office. “Why haven’t gotten sick yet? wear mask.” 

We flying back USA next week want back school, assuming let us back (need collect gov money). 

I really really hope miracle things get better next 6-8 weeks, think it’s going get worse, unfortunately. lot worse. seem many masks around necks even on. means letting people die, treatment, regardless hospital for, enough supplies, beds, staff. 

So, 60 get car crash heart attack, sorry, head home, room inn, here's enough ativan make suck bad die. lazy selfish MF'ers can't bothered wear damn mask. Either wear faces

Or

Covid put one alveoli Oh shit. scrolling pages. delete it? resident living western part state.  say everyone taking virus seriously. Everyone wearing masks inside public places. People social distancing. Businesses following strict guidelines given us Charlie Baker state. 

We worked hard get point still long way go. Gyms, bars, many businesses still open. 2nd part phase 2, WORKING. That’s fair - NY  Good strategy ensure millennials never afford house sunny place shady people  forum prefers “end world” articles. Um...the data still - put based historical data - date deaths happened. That's always data dumps sttes provide data. also field hospital ship. Overkill definitely better ill prepared worst Huh? People babies got pregnant sept/oct, well sign corona virus Hopefully convicted location day. Shit, I'm first open. Back April. come work full time starting day. Every single day huge threat. US 4% world's population 25% world's covid-19 deaths cases. Ontario Quebec densely populated still account 90% Canada's cases obviously vastly disproportionate amount. Ontario, Quebec outbreaks meat packing plants Alberta make majority Canada's cases. Look King Bhutan.  Omg please safe. It'll get dark. I'm told others there's end this. immediately see it. want believe it'll real.

I'm yet. first... bad. $20 says tomorrow. *"" Hatten said Tuesday’s press conference he’d willing pay fine wants fight business — others — remain open pandemic. ""*

Ya, fine $2500 costing stay closed. He'll pay ignore it. fin $2500 location; five minutes later making progress/effort closing location... fine again. Rinse repeat. That's interesting thought, heard anywhere. mind asking source?  shoving lot money effort keep everyone liquid. deficit going easy 5 trillion year over. going get punishment sooner later hospitals reach capacity. Maybe taking away Instagram would good deterrent. looks like maybe week cases peaking deaths peaking New York. Yup, pretty limited benefit. recollection Chinese study drug actually found benefit all. course study got buried study showing efficacy got pumped airwaves. Hmm... Apparently starting phase 3 trial early July. pump dump definitely shady, think moderna still decent shot. I’d give oxford Pfizer better odds right though IMO. place work got new “masks” us wear hot environment work. It’s fucking hair net. People wearing hair nets nose mouth. Im NY business owner say authority lockdown wasn’t slight inconvenience, many businesses never recovered shut couple months. movie theaters permanently businesses. colleges permanently shut down. recover set back quite bit. Every single functioning business stimulates economy, add numbers, it’s pretty insane. Businesses super fragile, even insurance world immunity mandated lockdowns. 

Keep mind prior COVID US wasn’t prosperous times. year ago still lived rough economic time, sure set us even back.

I agree however, grossly irresponsible put businesses well-being society. alone let know detrimental single week statewide lockdowns survival business, thus overall nation economy. however caused historical death tolls we’re witnessing now, prolonged pandemic handled seriously begin with. There’s lesson this, somewhere. Anyone look CDC best estimated infection mortality rate? dowgraderd . 26%!! numbers clear seen CDC page even USA Today admits number. simply calls claim false says headline says CDC ""confirmed"" really confirmed, best estimate. WOW...talk spinning good news bad!! Yes. take seriously..shutdown country think worldometers even bothers listing since there's data.   people may disagree, healthy pregnancy big medical deal. see doctor month 12-28 ish weeks, twice month 36weeks, week til delivery. get one maybe two ultrasounds. Doctors offices operating social distancing protocols. Ultrasound techs still working. OB wards everywhere separate floor/ward/wing ICU/covid areas. So, unless things take massively drastic change (like beyond catastrophic/mutation kills everyone higher rate..) OB docs/nurses still working normal. seen they're pulling OB docs work ICU floors. allowed. Executive orders orders halted due people liking it. also said would 3 million deaths now... ***STRONGLY*** doubt effectiveness Dr. Fauci due anti-health building stance. least ten years I’d think, census happening  take didn’t make Italy? think that’s little disingenuous, think it’s pretty safe critical fast tracked SARS2 vaccine original SARS1 potential vaccines killed people successful vaccine never found 18 years. Neighbor MD, said it’s good right now, especially pediatric levels moment. Unpopular opinion even relents lets 4 issue won’t help unless every major TX county joins them. People drive county next door. That’s sounds like fairly reasoned response drunk Canadian guy. restrictions think he'll make? We're right ""bent over"" ""taking long started like it"" gunna happen. Rona Tide Lmao yep. I’m nurse myself, right trying dox months actually believe China reports? I’m saying lockdown can’t exist indefinitely public health experts need come numbers represent acceptable risk.

So shouldn’t “OMG numbers going up!!” course are. be, “Are numbers within acceptable parameters?” not, “How get back acceptable parameters?”

Not “sky falling” reporting without context. data isnt saying it. called ""experts"" are. know track record been... many, many reported cases, people died matter days week. It’s true people longer, don’t think chalk absolute lack increased deaths expectation deaths lag full 4 weeks behind new cases. even case, first new spikes began many five six weeks ago places, haven’t coincided uptick within last 2-3 weeks. feel like much small population lot practical easy control. lot bureaucracy opinions 3 populated country planet effect extremely difficult control population. would lot better federal system effective states actually got asses something practical even much ask Actually double-down today insisting enough beds believe Yeah that's prob, mega corps gorged stimulus whether needed not.... think do, internet makes pretty easy turn favorite distraction junk food. 75% deaths individuals 65 older would likely die case pneumonia. Let’s calm down, please. Oh god...  plague rat bullshit.

No one saying lock forever, stop acting like it.  “surge ICU capacity” probably doesn’t include actual staff needed operate it. preliminary reports peer-reviewed. They regarded conclusive, guide clinical practice / health-related behavior, reported news media established information. actually there's easier way, could shut poke dick health department's affair.

Malaysia's president look condition malaysia's in, i'd argue president brightest mind least knows shut up.  people go cabins bar hop? ohhhhh here. go cabin we're tuning nature. assumed family get together enjoy outdoors day play cards Monopoly fire. 

If went group 5 left bar hop, I'd gone got back. really understand downvoted, true people gather protest can't run business make much sense. gym, probably even enforced reduced capacity limits something order keep running wont hear media mention kinds things. clear, play identity politics care left right. whole situation something observe stepping back look whole picture. pretty weird situation growing country people need realize weird wrong is.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* understand, people plan pregnancies now, medical systems overwhelmed!? Reading context great greatest thing I've ever seen Reddit. Right here. Nah, we're headed great direction. need change anything all. damn young kids going bars anyways. /s Lmao right? Fuck avoided saying location months sub. public duty know y'all going offer sofa lose job. I've never liked country music. Somehow feel vindicated. 

It always gave headache. never imagined could give virus. vaccine really help someone already infected virus, unless dont understand vaccines work.

Rabies's shot often given infection, rather long incubation (2 months). I'm aware preemptive vaccine something shorter incubation time like covid. went city 300,000 village 280. 0's that. 280 people. wonderful. seem life-saving though, studies show statistically significant improvement mortality, reduction recovery time far know. still desirable obviously, cure. Texas stop reporting? Houston? I've waiting lol think recessions do? Easter. Gone Easter. it’s definitely gone now. Back work don’t forget vote guy pulled us this! news US outgoing flights banned rest world depend people health. must take responsibility yourselves. Nobody gone fucking parties first place. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. don’t time listen right happen explain thought 2 years SARS 1 didn’t find successful vaccine 18?  I’ve always curious people think we’re going jam one original SARS could never come one. course not. actually love country music. specifically talking CMT top 40 stuff. could listen Townes Van Zandt day. Yup. take look Amsterdam. I'm amazed didnt big outbreaks. masks, nobody follows social distancing. dense city aswell.  caring parents might choose sending kids school daycare, ending losing jobs, family run business, homes. county near (Texas) county commissioners vote declared ""sanctuary county"". Meaning 100% open nobody bothered enforce otherwise. read. Plus, pre-covid less bias current articles. Total hospitalizations isn’t “in hospital today”. might give “new hospitalizations today” that’s thing. People linger, it’s one-in-one-out. Knowing taxed system important. Independent research fact checking feels like high level college course Americans. us reading extremest headlines generated clicks eat shit like 3/4 burger. sad think America can't come together like counties combat this. takes little understanding concesus massively save thousands lives. really intensified last month so,"" said McMurray-Horton. ""We actively trying transfer ICU surge patients COVID positive investigation, capacity treat patients,"" McMurray-Horton Health Systems said transferred patients UTMB Galveston, Woodlands, far away Conroe. scramble find beds patients also trickle week now, Houston Fire Chief Sam Pena spoken longer transfer time patients firefighters bring ambulance. normal transfer time may take approximately 20 minutes. past three weeks, data shows 560 occasions, firefighters holding ambulance patients hour.

When really starts pick texas nowhere divert to, 5-6 NYCs happening simultaneously enough slack capacity nationally rushed hotspot surge purposes. actual numbers? Doubt it. Kids wired learning focus learn constantly even outside school. 

[Have heard summer Practices finest form law, Texas law. Without solar panels California sounds right. post articles, I'm saying smart learn. entire groups looking excuse part solution adds fuel fire.

I know ridiculous someone knows far many ridiculous people makes life lot pain ass typically is.  Whenever go see maybe one person aside mask on. employees even wear anymore. stupid actually gives headache. Serious question. take serious conflicting information? told facts. Aren’t starting question narrative all? Hopefully also cause us stop depending non-scientists manage pandemic. Torontonian, I'm willing bet make disproportionate Ontario number heavily weighted stupid behaviors like wearing masks, going crowded places like ""open everything"" protests bars beaches hot spot states, etc. anything else. think people forfeit expectation care first place.  ACA perfect piece legislation. Obama said himself. able get months 60 tenuous votes Senate. We're gonna need retake senate end filibuster get something better through. mask, everyone gets infected. knew? right drive drunk.
We right set fireworks crowded public places.
We right take shit middle supermarket.
We right spread pandemic. Ummm, it’s IV only. they’re buying tablet it’s “a whole new world” Theres reasons this. biggest market strength corporations many, great. eliminating small market competition big companies fine stronger ever one coming. own.

And that's brother law (doctor) write script oxygen generator. thousand bucks recoup later cheap insurance. Red MAGA masks. US, bc HIPAA laws. replaced bunch cops people happily follow illegal orders authoritarian practices think you’ve made situation *better*? believe Dr Rebekah Jones’ numbers? thou 100% agree. Scientists skeptical first never coronavirus vaccine before, never really tried develop one either. never threw much research funding behind developing SARS MERS vaccines, especially viruses brought control. candidates virus discussed initially (the Chinese inactivated vaccine, Moderna mRNA one, Oxford one adapted MERS vaccine candidate) sailing clinical trials far. We’ll see perform larger trials, lack significant side effects antibody responses observed far sure promising. vaccines don’t work many right behind them.

On side note, biggest pet peeve life “knock wood” keep hearing discuss preliminary vaccine success. People right talk promising signs much worrying signs discussing going somehow make vaccine candidates fail. looked like vaccine going harder develop thought, I’m sure media would it. wouldn’t want “jinx it”. overweight, African American woman cancer already covid. hard time it, figured survive share I've learned reddit. family also probably it. Learn disagree someone without disrespectful. Many people die covid already one foot grave. Flu even bad cold might've also killed ones died here. make deaths less sad, close school conduct business social distanced way cases? dont think answer automatic no. comparison terms hospital beds per capita New York Arizona? TMC actually changed report data 1 day showing network hitting 100% base capacity ICU use. 


Their justification changing it? claim ""confusing Looks like bring ventilator priority too. crazy sad. believe it? would trust fear mongering media. nice try fox news.... ""the left piranhas"" video YouTube one fav videos time.

And loved Yang Sanders guests. Amazing stuff.

Alas, far he's fallen.... Arizonas yesterday delayed school couple weeks, closed gyms pools bars. hey indoor dining haircuts still table statewide masks. half measures enough right? Honestly im glad something certainly doesn’t seem like enough. you? cases spiking too? Stay safe! Man times stressful. morbidly obese like entire south. Hi, sorry dig old thread. searching someone symptoms (loss smell/taste open airways, well sinus pressure). turn mind asking, symptoms experience?

I got tested today waiting results days. must say bit anxious healthy young much worry about. 

Cheers! Asshole knowledge science yells conspiracy theory nonsense backs right wing talking points oddly really benefits entrenched special interests. “sky falling” reporting without context.

What context need here? Health officials saying months pandemic going wreak havoc us needed take extreme measures contain it. 

I get people like want kind soft message this? anything, people need ""the sky falling"" reporting finally comprehend historic global pandemic. 

I get mate, Americans built situations like this. want costs continue live life knew regardless going around them. I'm sorry say though, virus give shit economy lifestyle become custom to. 

We going make sacrifices one way another here. 

I say though, everyone would take mask wearing serious, could greatly reduce spread virus. getting sick, protecting vulnerable. That's whole freaking point exercise. I'm thinking along lines Richard Horton, editor-in-chief Lancet, matter.  Agreed. Also AZ beyond landlocked, plenty room field hospitals keep cool. Sure could've saved $1tril putting mask sign weakness takes away freedom! Plus makes orange idol look bad./s don’t much way family aside wife son. 

I’d love learn new things try new hobbies son takes time. It’s scientific term. live New York it’s incredible seeing trend - NY northeast whole. 

It’s also profound see south utterly flagrantly fuck Ah OK, I'm seeing now.
 
I reading 100 month week. Facts. terrible respiratory infection/walking pneumonia earlier year -- high fever, nasal congestion, sore throat, awful dry cough, lethargy, shortness breath -- several months costochondritis -- basically really strange chest pain -- recently disappeared. anyone else covid-19 costochondritis? 

apparently costochondritis caused viral infections... believe him. might saying make people take seriously. said we'd reaching 3k daily deaths June we've 1k day month.  Bet heaviest weighted score list medical insurance. sign things come Fall Universities in-person classes. really expecting college kids huge parties tailgate? Look teledoc.

Robot doctors. Need say more. That’s one way keep active cases 0 Facts. Since almost med-tech globe comes Israel terrible news.  summer break kids learn valuable social skills, learn practice hobbies, travel gain life experience grow people. 

We're still pandemic. Many summer programs closed, limiting social interaction hobby practice. Travel dangerous. We've pulling 10% less previous week's numbers consistently while. deaths lag behind cases hospitalization, recent uptick cases hospitalizations... expect death count start going soon.  guess something better nothing.

Another research AMA back saying flight want. saying bad. Stay home can. Lol real know role hospital another Florida resident apologize see deal people can't take common sense measures care one another. 

It's really sad hope become overwhelming situation guys sad US seen benchmark failure. 

Coming one disappointed American. response be... ""but....but.... i'm white!"" mean Nazis settled Huntsville? Feel better? I’m Oakland near alameda, mostly here, masks everyone one old guy wearing maga hat. I'm going assume American. identify states.  Saying I'm US means much saying Europe.  Someone Northern Italy Sweden going different experience someone Crete true US. know wealth health Florida. fact committee reopen Florida medical professionals scream that. Exactly point; anything new like everyone thread making seem. definitely good NY put place soon did. AZ needs take things seriously, unlike NY may forced use contingency plan. I'm saying is, again, simply nothing new like OP's editorialized title makes sound. Every state probably contingency plan look hard enough. Huh?  US Chernobyl, stay away,far far away... Kids often good learning want learn, abet always. lot stuff kids need learn pretty boring, certainly it’s rare person would interested everything demand kids learn especially since school lot specific learning demands (eg learn particular bit Spanish grammar 10am 45 minutes set exercises), hard even interested good learning said topic.

I agree this. probably fair think even best teachers make stuff interesting, interesting everyone. 

PM happen article. idea non-cognitive skills important seems valid me, wonder well taught schools. 50-60% US college students need sort remedial education, unfortunately remediation often doesn’t work (and we’re taking remediation it’s something like algebra, calculus).

that's first I've heard that. speaks larger failure education system prepare students higher education. wear fucking mask.  fun lawsuit keep eye It’s gonna happen. People love showering people money basically job. heroes. GoFundMe misused plague. amount money donated insane. I’m sure downvoted too. 

I realize campaigns set help people medical issues financial injustice, please enlighten monetary problem solved hoard cash? reward again, right thing. right thing shouldn’t special especially level. 

Let downvotes begin. cant give county city??? get hospital group someone know severity without knowing section Florida. That's like saying ""I live NY never coronavirus issue am"". accurate live upstate section far anywhere else live Turkey, find hard believe media coronavirus reports. Even though numbers infected people rise again, deaths always decrease etc. 

I know world able know much government shares, outsider, think Turkey successful? I'm especially curious European perspective considering they've mostly beaten first wave. summer seems trend bottom states too. Can't quite put finger Excluding election trump in? I'll give shot, thanks. fucking stupid beyond belief. Super agree. feel them, I'm sorry pulling short end stick, grocery stores functions, restaurants operate safely, bars little contribute basic functions daily life. also encourages people behave irresponsibly. close create alternative business model -- like go cocktails outdoor patios lots spacing.  Well, I’m watching real time reality hits lot folks East South East Texas. course acting like always took seriously, even though didn’t. Relatives getting sick dying. Businesses forcibly closing due lost workers (infected dying). Production lines close shutting down. It’s getting real here! Fed: ""Hold beer"" keep trying open things, hopefully able go back work soon. Hopefully everyone get back work soon. oxford one succesful animal human trials.

They're phase 3/phase 4 now.

If vaccine safe works, 2 billion doses ready ship. said “couldn’t even pay 1/3 utility bill.” statement, it’s structured, means utility bill *at least* 3 times (or triple) specified value. “At least” strict meaning mathematically financially.

100/wk estimated 400/month. least triple 1,200/month. Trusting government goes worldview. 

A lot conspiracy theory types distrustful authority. authority says something believed in, 180 preserve distrust. know bankrupt reads exactly Trump said 😰 going walk back forth next town over?
 
For me, that's 15 miles way, 50 way major city. 
 
Average walking speed 4 miles hour. 
 
So you, best case, would walk 4 hours 8 hour shift? 90+ degree weather 90+% humidity? 
 
You go super star. Give money dad worked science tech whole career. 78yo still private pilot's license held 40 years. absolutely logical this. Wont let show studies show spouting crap. Throws absolute tantrum. get it, man known whole life. baffling. I'll feel bad, case r/leopardsatemyface I've ever seen one NZ right..... Soooo..... Accepting Texan refugees? looks like path herd immunity chosen. default nothing else.  Problem remember right NY place right sporting chance enough people Covid fighting chance it.  

This going suck. Asshats CA wonder many ppl Arizona visiting vacation bringing RONA NY like cases highest April, it’s disgusting really made reconsider health care worker knew infectious disease foolishly cavalierly completely disregarded warnings precautions least small degree **DESERVE** fate. wear steaks around neck jump tiger cage surprised complete utter lack sympathy. might even stifle chuckle, stupid live, well that's that. live popular running, biking, walking route couple miles outside Boston seen anyone wearing N95 running. everything cloth people put getting close someone else. say April South Carolinians worry special shit?   lowest common denominator fans? surely 'upskirting rules'.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* they’ll start next script “its 40% COVID. 60% NON-COVID idiots” assume regional. cases pretty low Michigan right now, may terribly busy. blood drawn 5pm Tuesday woke Wednesday morning, results (negative). 12, maybe 14 hours. auntie wearing tan suit? wonder died. know available live, curbside pickup bomb diggity.

Order pay online, pull up, pop trunk, show ID glass, load groceries shut trunk...off go. one extra pair hands touching stuff, IMO that's insignificant risk compared benefit zero contact grocery shopping.  RemindMe! 4 weeks much Paul Rands dumbass comment today kids can’t spread it. Tbf, didn’t know cloth masks would work whole thing started. Cloth masks really came about, massive shortage regular masks. also lot blurring would work healthcare workers (remember, first exploded nurses doctors hospitals told wear bandanas). course, healthcare workers raising alarm cloth masks weren’t protecting them. 

Now better idea cloth fine grocery shopping, definitely hospital work! Ya haven’t issues getting put mask on. I’ve heard every excuse book try get wearing though. moved St. Pete 2 years ago. Miami yet like large crowds people always impression super crowded especially poorer areas.

Just looked FL county population density. Kinda surprised 

My county # 1 population density Miami-Dade # 5. site day sure they’re still mean exception despite conspiracy theory susceptible people earth, don’t (as far things reported news) adopt behaviour curb spread virus. Even Economist covers them. protesting still irresponsible behavior Pandemic.

LA said effected big time. signed August LSAT there’s still word person not. cases overwhelmingly coming bars, restaurants, large entertainment venues involving lots people gathering indoors without masks.

Younger people saying fuck it, getting Corona, going work visit family without mask spreading like wildfire. read article? university asked vast majority students said returning whether classes not. Unfortunately think 2-3 weeks forth July much worse.

And anyone saying spike going California, eat steaming pile fresh bull feces. people consider YouTube videos scientific Well yeah bars low hanging fruit here. Clearly people pack drink distance wear masks. high risk.

Gyms etc close later SHTF. Maybe followed indoor dining. think find places too. yeah, pretty gross. Given exponential increase number viruses person's body time due replication, breathing hundreds thousands viral particles one exposure would lead significant infection shorter time; exposure viral particles starting infection takes longer reach level infection, giving immune response time counteract it. Larger T-cell response, antibodies - time infection reaches numbers first effectively contained immune response, symptoms develop.

Just science-based theory. TL;DR: Wear mask. LA really bad lately. go jog walk dog, less half people see *have* masks, let alone wear properly. went mall 2 weeks ago 10% people there, indoors air-conditioned building, masks all, another 20% wearing them, rest us physically stay 6 feet anyone. noped quickly possible. several groups high school aged kids running around masks. parents going stoked catch 'rona. Gathering massively dense crowds little social distancing, actively chanting shouting (generating huge levels airborne viral particulates), wearing poorly fitted cloth mask (that almost nothing filtering virus particles) faaaaar ""incredibly low risk"". read much painful deeply uncomfortable. Think times experienced sensation found deeply unpleasant otherwise painless. defend anything unless somebody tells it. morbidly obese that's serious preexisting condition Grrrrr No, don’t give shit. don’t care anyone. care money themselves. That’s it. turds pulse. per capita basis, America well us, they'd 2,000 - 3,000 cases per day... sad best 10x worse that... like 20x worse. /r/selfawarewolves Pretty extreme. Especially considering masks far effective way secure health safety others.

Maybe focus effective ways stop virus instead throwing freedom religion window Well people can't bothered vote. pure entitled laziness prevails get situation like US hands Ditto Oh wow that's really interesting that's 1) I'm talking 2) said. sounds like something Fry would say exactly. Might well put outdoor concerts like Bonnaroo back protests LITERALLY amount exposure risk Bonaroo Nothing grenades TX beaches right China blame though? talking husband this. it’s said done know someone close us make pandemic. It’s sobering incredibly disheartening know way. play Russian roulette friends family, instead taking seriously many us ignored joked warnings. True n95 likely. Kn95 yes. worn correctly provide near n95 performance legit. need tight seal clean shave achieve this. list below, unfortunately lot fakes eBay etc. best reviews heard supplyaid sunjoe(not list below), Bo'er Wyze website, one called powercom bonafide mask. also heard good things airqueen mask although believe kn95. get 10 shields $20 eBay. say $3/mask+$2 shield $5 cut risk way especially comorbidities. Still everything distance, adding two things amplify effects indoors. May little early tell, 14 day wait period seems least amount days symptoms start showing. Top 5 Stop trying unskew numbers Weird one actually talking shit that's causing this.

Y'know, mass outside social gatherings people insistent doing. 

Hmm. Yep, people nothing lose. guaranteed healthcare, job proteciton, livin paycheck paycheck, pretty much expecting die anyway, virus next medical emergency. majority people typical middle class case, 4% death rate big risk.  
This protest gave little hope something another mortal danger people live under, may worth risk. Sun terrible newspaper. wouldn’t believe word written thing. We're #1 (in people believing angels pretty dire charleston. f&amp;b folks dropping like flies. Really, why? 


Like would guy lie? What's motivation?  hearing facts, Rand Paul demanded ""happy talk"".

China’s regulatory process something striving emulate. examples vaccines problematic side effects, like dengue fever vaccine, Lyme disease vaccine. Elective surgery means scheduled article's lead image Blue Man Group? sources terrible. swear thousands people protested/rioted. forget that. want lower tax rate?they already everyone raged  ""just flu"" it'd gone now, getting worse widespread infections.

Stay strong entirely random, they're following Australian lockdown method, successful 1 state, basically left retail open, allowed dine restaurants, take away. Thank much looking it! Much appreciated. great day/night. :) did, Abbott stripped power. country from? Remember California 45 million people it. downplaying, population factor here. wrote YES: 

PhD researcher here. spent hours trying convince person science could find including pretty great meta-analysis published response: ""WHO corrupt org funded it."" person heavily believes Essential Oils. science could spout debunked pics YouTube clips.

We're walls stupidity. provide data, squat hold wall. strange disease tell ya.... people get can't taste food days. Others end life death situations. That's people play .... ebola-like bet people would treating pandemic differently. customers dead, proffit? buy weed Sundays... deliver! never said racists here. friends arguing people take seriously. Obviously didn’t work. saying protests right wrong time virus, corrupt administration prolonging virus's impact think good we've shown still willing protest. steal election, there, know you’re right. traits toxicity sometimes too. It’s people man. that's high rate positive test results: 6.093/41=14.8%

&amp;#x200B;

they need testing least twice many people.  won’t playing. Everyone already knows this. Minnesota seen spike protests Memorial Day (which would almost entirely outside). Meanwhile, saw hundred new cases bars. yeah, I'll quantify risk you: outdoor = risky. Also: trying end Obamacare. pandemic. share source? Yes, I'm sure drill cost 250 times spent that

You sound really informed bud Hopefully get ski season next year :/. wish everyone would grow fuck wear mask try get shit control. seeing everyone bar it’s definitely gonna shut again. kind shit worst thing coronavirus Reddit. Ya'll flawed 'calculations' sake collective fear mongering.

I've still got saved post someone 'calculations' deciding ""more likely"" going 8 million cases US Easter. became apparent happen, revising 800k. Still ended half that.

A scenario 2.7 million Texans test positive (which would 20% current worldwide total) next 80 days scenario hundred thousands die.

You need get grip, that's going happen, drastic measures would taken got point. Suggesting 2.7 million people going get infected Texas next 80 days insane, even Reddit standards. Worth try? that's policeman's job.

To shoot people wearing masks?

Why wouldnt think justified theory performing public service think applied? Could dont think established ok cop remove threat society, matter many people threatened.

What sort threat society? Even one person threatened? people threatened? I'm confused reasoning here. think feeling gut/lizard brain/caveman brain rather thinking quarantine Capital Offence.

Is it? Yes do, I'm sure definition elective fluid enough adapt bit, I'm afraid adapt fast enough start getting full fucking *wish* handled well I'd forgive everything else vote him. 

But wasn't, be, people going die. serious question lol boosted immune system disaster, wrong way even think it.

A properly supported immune system runs gently possible gentler.

Support boost.

So right, need much better discussion, we've got start right goals removing common jargon would first. Preaching choir. Yep work healthcare. wear masks compliant work.

Was told colleague ""constitutional right"" wear mask outside work.

1) fucking part constitution, specifically? 
2) fuck work healthcare?

Other countries problem. Shameful. “Mommy, ocean going away?”
(Looks)
“RUNNNNNNN!!!!” Everything bigger Texas. Well technically, finally, yahoos! They'll also cause issues creating herd immunity like already measles mumps. used actually make living social media 2 years deactivated (aside Reddit) best decision I've ever made. incredible constant noise consume you. top that, sheep mentality incredibly toxic, made even more-so everyone piggy-backing opinions/content sake making like good people. want fight homophobia, racism injustice world? Donate. Volunteer. actual conversations people know in-person bring awareness. want post online, sharing resources, testimonials, allow people's voice heard. Simply re-posting hashtag latest trend cut it.

I also realized hilarity term internet ""influencers"" day almost merely consuming content. Eating food, buying &amp; trying makeup, etc. They're influencing anything fueling consumer culture. Obviously apply content creators, mass majority (and often viewed) fall category.

Long story short? There's power getting man-made hamster wheel find starting really live life *you*. Finding *you're* actually interested pursuing it. Everything bigger Texas Agreed. Yes, quoting part sunlight..... Nah, gonna forget 120K died. Even though best numbers US (so far) see loads gatherings worries we’ll slip right back spike. level disregard human beings I’ve witnessed really opened eyes selfish people are. Despite that, I’ll continue right neighbors fellow massholes hopes careless ones might turn new leaf. holding breath, though.. Unlike airlines, still give free nuts. goes health insurance along . . . Yanno, assuming job lets get enough hours qualify it. best friends father passed away weeks ago. everything “right” kids stayed away parents March April.. stayed home.. etc. first week May father went ER thought pneumonia. incredibly advanced lung cancer died 3 weeks later. fast. friend angry lost two months him. really, no. Cases declined across country, protests across country. It'd rather strange, think, protests caused spike find evidence urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth three weeks following protest onset buy stock GILD would inadvisable point? Yikes. honestly cannot fathom big deal people. Even don’t believe it, hurt go along people’s comfort peace mind? even much you, can’t stay home? It’s like never thought single person themselves. fair, said ""not anti Vader"", like, that's still good look support Empire, man. recently returned flight 6/29. I'm planning self-quarantining ability tested ""hopefully"" quarantine entire 14 days.

I planning taking test Thrusday Friday looks article read, likely could false 100% time day exposed virus. (There viral particles nose saliva soon infection test cannot detect them.)
* 40% time tested four days exposure virus.
* 20% time develop symptoms tested three days symptoms started.

Thoughts? Fucking idiots³ retarded apples lowers IQ whole bunch kids really need get back normal.

And virus control possible. No, it’s plan staying New York. you’re passing fine. I'm hoping HOPING July 4th going disaster think going be. :-/ find odd assumes universal health care systems like Europe somehow hugely inefficient? really see evidence that. Seems opposite look health outcomes vs. percent income spent health care. overbearing sense entitlement encouraged manipulated social media. Citing saw something tiktok, culture war hysteria goggles, data, dude.

Like, would even mention twirkers white? Soros make degenerates? mask slipping. live California. workplace telling us remote employees won’t going office January. Bars/clubs need bailout. Reacting surroundings losers. Yeah, would much smarter could set social distancing pods beach parks show everyone spread groups vs shutting driving everyone party indoors. I’m assuming studies would done normal laboratory setting, sunlight would never factor. lmao people believe sort thing, refuse understand privacy lost idea modern world technology. Satellites, drones, CCTV, etc. aside, people peddle sort thing likely send phone use Facebook group get ""information"" first place - completely forgetting fact *all* information monitored, shared, stored, sold *constantly.* That’s absolutely insane considering ~20,000 daily new cases 2-3 weeks ago. **interesting** rates Minneapolis steady. crazy surge cases everyone silently fearing. 

But yes, I'm playing safe. Wear mask, social distance stay home. usual know do. Good health one things really value gone Except likely didn't. Across UK we've seen decline cases, even protests. would strange see spike Birmingham *because* protests elsewhere compulsatory many countries, especially measles bcg fallen favor. Though think think actual immunity covid vaccines anyways.  nailed it, bro! Nice. 

Actually, worried pretty big deal allowed move freely even it. good didn’t cause bigger problem! link takes article related covid-19. me? ...And see reason least assume likely case.

And people concerned mostly China blatantly manipulating numbers...

Hope people 'member this. Wow, that's big coincidence -- reunion actually Destin! think time I'm businesses closed limited hours. looking forward checking local breweries I'm thinking we'll probably need nix that. 

Were people wearing masks generally courteous other? knowing trump, he’s gonna deny thing. people like refuse admit they’re wrong Harm reduction. many people die waiting? That's emergency authorizations exist.  rest world morally obliged ignore patent. getting coronavirus might actually make reconsider rallies almost guaranteed super spreader events...so would probably better everyone caught virus. Phoenix great case study. Two weeks protests surge cases among young people. Despite , reopened nearly month protests started seen surge older groups. again, wears mask outside Phoenix it’s 100 degrees? Texas Medical Association: ask wear mask, social distance, wash hands stay home can. Wink wink 😉 feeling something one-day blip due reporting delays. reporting 20-40 dead per day weeks now, consistently. I'll go back day fair comparison though considering lack available testing early days melanin seen Georgia? We’re getting pretty crazy here. Per capita worse Florida Texas. eh 1 wrong chemical vaccine cud cause massive fatalities, dunno think steady rollout best, im sure best experts world devising plans country rushing roll vaccine instantly... guess I'm losing half family. fine. Good answers. know #2. Funny melanin impeding vitamin absorption literally color people’s skin. Von Miller asthma makes sense he'd tougher time. Zeke Elliot though got mid-June, says he's already back normal. Yeah goes job they'll give someone doesnt care health safety money I'd ever imagined. Trump brought sunlight. 

I mean, Trump Administration dangerous, depressing...but anything, anxiety stems 40% people think he's A-OK.

It helped self esteem bit though. think nearly impossible standards I've holding people whose opinions used care about? Lol, zero fucking standards...zero. many ppl getting blasted pepper spray tho? I'm pretty sure happened select cities small groups protesters refusing move asked cops. attended several protests around LA county minimal cop presence cop presence, cops interfere protests went to. see videos LA protest cops started getting aggressive protesters even though unprovoked. v disappointing. use pepper spray, think usage common, disappointing see police chose go pepper spray route middle respiratory pandemic. test never 100,000 new cases day! Problem solved get saying let's hope medical research communications improved even little bit 60s. absurd? Give concrete examples boomer insults like “use head.” gave 3 nations similar social structures. Maybe actually read people’s posts open mind, wouldn’t getting downvoted could actual discussion.  born Saudi Arabia American. understand religions etc shave beard. ...I making joke DUDE-BRO thing. really care someone wears mask facial hair, wanted make sure men realized ""AIR-oor"" (error). ...I got cancer, facial hair, COVID-19 everywhere, can't dumb ass anymore keep face fully shaved. Yikes. I'm South Burleson-Cleburne area. one point, NY hit hard mostly wearing masks following guidelines would go get pickup orders. week started open back May 1st lot people thought over. went Cleburne today pick food order materials order everyone tons wearing masks. even, first time, person little bitty town wearing mask. BREAKING NEWS: CORONAVIRUS VACCINE READY, DEPLOYED WORLDWIDE Wild guess: know somebody (or somebody) actually hearing ""this thing joke"". went Cornell. Ever heard it? graduated four years, never studied once, drunk whole time, sang acapella group, 'Here Comes Treble'. MOUNTAIN evidence much lower that. 

Please share everyone data referencing statement. Point taken, I’m hardcore conversation. Italy ugly schools open back up, it'll even higher. Wow. Look opinions It’s curious thing, spines vanished state. vertebra miles. shot happens Sources? Madness.  Why? everyone reap sow. vulnerable people still need go groceries attend critical medical appointments. people unlucky 'essential' job. Neither luxury stay control stupidity people around them. groups chance unlucky suffering consequences recklessness people around them.  Watch laugh work. tested handful people. recommend petition CDC update idea. tourists No, ""agree disagree"" place, place ""what kind bread best turkey sandwich "" WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC real not.  100,000 isn’t much. flu kills year

/s think be. encouraged deaths came AZ. Amen!!!! They've created (""printed"") $3T far. think free lunch called stimulus came from? rise chart paid newly created money.       
It's keep interest rates 0%. never ending supply money lent out, supply/demand debt markets gravitate towards 0%.  stop printing, huge deficits, interest rates shoot roof.  exit strategy. Go outside I’m anti-vaxxer, definitely won’t first take vaccine that’s made quick. I’ll wait people like get first round make sure health effects aren’t immediately negative. info number tests we’re ran? large sample size variables? Easy there, Matt Foley. Let believe, need sports back. Touching common surfaces yes exposed enough viral load, subject body make-up anywhere including outside, affected. Get better soon. get pizza local pizza place pick every weekend. always give 18 percent tip. Cause like want stay business.   I've got issue tl:dr bots. They're doubt helpful discourage much-needed visitors websites rely website traffic revenue. means journalists work hard create stories credited work also, often removes nuance story leading misinterpreted articles. We're living age journalism industry (on website relies) increasingly threat numerous different angles. wish Reddit would take look hate say expect 40 years told owe society nothing asking population make sacrifice? 

If wanna trace back something, trace back Regan Thatcher. movement cemented US, selfish response see today. 

Thatcher even said: thing society individuals families. Wait 5-7 days get tested.

Symptoms usually start 2-21 days. might limited I'm sure, follow local news super closely whenever I'm staying somewhere, reporting spike cases. place absolutely slammed though. booked last room available hotel stayed at. Bars restaurants packed pretty much mask wearing. that's something bother lot, Florida general probably best. Works great wear people flying in. Still, that’s ahead US. 

Finally! Chinese beat US making vaccine good them! finally make Americans realize inflexible FDA’s present process vaccine drug approval is. 

All delay basically injecting proteins arm. make hoopla want safety efficacy it’s rocket science. get virus protein. inject muscle. flu vaccine updated every year FAST. 

But people don’t know vaccine isn’t safe FDA gave OK federal government actually assumes liability harm beyond manufacturer certain circumstances. Thus , fed government let take chances dying one 1000 avoid 1 1,00,000 chance could bad rash allergic reaction 1 million chance costs Mula- mula always number one US even ahead scientifically sound experimental drug prevent getting COVID. Mula #1 it’s don’t vaccine don’t forget it. Leaving apartment get groceries exposing like ~ 75 people exposed probably 100 people past 10 days exposing 1000s people whenever get groceries going arena concert least feel like good person superior ‘bad people’. could work given kept pointing stock market last remaining ""success"". collapses nothing left. common narrative, something come attention.        
*Artenstein said understood FBI work.*

*“I think intentions pure,” said. “What told us sure supplies going hospitals first responders elsewhere. that’s good.”*    
Where say, hold phone here. government thought power direct masks shipments hospitals, need lie us. could redirected masks retail sales hospitals.  time, people New York City told wear cloth masks, instead hearing work.   
This mask business needs investigated. seem recall March President opposed using Defense Production Act, saying equated Venezuelan nationalization.     
Who made decision March lie masks, instead using police power government direct masks hospitals? Im exactly sure point besides created money recently response pandemic prevent total economic collapse. Early fall sounds lot better 2 years! widespread scheduled blackouts new absolutely correct solution. band-aid instead actually maintaining electrical lines. disorganized. horrible giving warning sometimes sitting work someone says got alert we're scheduled blackout get PGE website see going start maybe go home, course website down. Often blackouts occur places windspeeds near zero. makes sense. I'm seriously waiting hear there's another Enron situation going they're making money this.  US 330 million. *MY* rights *YOUR* life!!!!!!!11112 bud gotta drink water. drink coconut water gatorade it. eat foods easy body process rich nutrients: chicken broth, fish soup, pho, salmon fillet. Easy starches, they'll help keep weight on... white rice great. regular breathing exercises laying stomach soon feel strong enough so. indeed Covid, body hell fight gotta give artillery needs.

ps: Take vitamins. Vitamin (not kind thats ""one day"" type thing. get pure vitamin capsules) help autoimmune system. Take morning. Take Echinacea, help autoimmune system, also Zinc cut amount time sick (it help, anyway). Additionally, Cod Liver Oil capsules fucking wonderful health. Take one day. Take anytime.=

pps: this, take time light exercise. watch funny movies. Read enjoyable books. Fill time sleep things make happy. less stress hormones (cortisol) produce happiness hormones (dopamine/endorphin) brain/body easier time body fighting getting back feet. It’s definitely all. see butthurt test right! thought Coronazona bad state. sooner people embrace new normal, better. Ringing 2021 going magical end this. Zeke got April intervention Dak's house Dak's brother. know Miller asthma, asthma shown make significant difference.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  mean genre talks muh freedoms much? What? 

Just look Remdesivir: comes US patent, stocks mostly go towards United States get first dibs new medicine profitability higher there. Similar earlier French company said US would get first dibs European socialized costs American first serve due profitability considerations. 

And world may need drug, suddenly generic variants coming market year countries socialize medicine back US R&amp;D without pay said R&amp;D. think world would able create generic Remdesivir US developed privately first? 

I would absolutely love see breakdown HDI internationally whatever closest political subdivision states across world. Massachusetts first, assume there'd parts Norway Switzerland would higher, think it'd pretty damn close top. Almost everything, true false, reported point. latest info asymptomatic people likely spreaders anyone else, remain contagious longer. (That really point sentence though - point would uptick people infected protests.) ""We""

Talking spreading money amongst population sending check house every month

Think said, US share rest world cheap, gouged fuck people benefit faceless corporate profit?

And support this? Unless executive like Pfizer, fuck would take pride model???? Ok wonder would like treat Covid patients without wearing mask? Hopefully, want die ridiculous Well legislation says don’t pay sue evict them. get live free home. I've read eight days exposure minimizes chance false negative. I'd schedule test next Tuesday. bothers right SOOO much  key seems be. people present actually wear masks, make reasonable efforts avoid infecting others.  

People bars, wear masks, make efforts get close others. seems opposite needed.

We need kind flexible straw worn mask. straw curl around chin, exit mask chin, dip glass, wearer sip cocktail wearing mask.

Give straws customers, order wear masks.

Then, maybe, try explain judge ""right"" make people sick. Yeah went Saturday afternoon. tried curbside pickup Lowe's 3 day delay ask (they tell order either). Gotcha. Yeah, might true. guess trying say thousands people close proximity it’s pretty apparent lot taking precautions. literally family members. planned vacation couple months ago assuming America would get handle virus. stated feel comfortable going couple weeks ago based conditions time. things worse they're plowing ahead trying shame going. wait year see person actions save lives.  jesus christ, Florida tested 43,000 people found 6K cases. Indeed. right. Goes show. logic humans going extinct best outcome possible! bar owners lose everything. Others might diverse portfolio get by. put financial well wellness community? No. Recent headlines shown bars super spreaders. Drunks suck protocol. baseline folks going bars now, understand seriousness Corona Virus.

I genuinely feel bad small business owners facing ruin. sue open venue without doubt transmit COVID stress medical facilities? Put doctors nurses greater risks? put essential workers families risk?

You write: ""Many bars never open again.""

The folks died, never live  salmonella would get first there's drama whose fault etc etc that's soap opera care watch kind answered question end. 

Deaths went cases slowed thanks lockdowns, we're seeing uptick cases deaths inevitably go again. We're also already seeing hospitals Texas Arizona overwhelmed new cases.

And also celebrate fact, slowly starting open stuff (at least states slowly), people ended ruining following safety guidelines. we're situation again. Smart New York. Pennsylvania need exact thing Right wing conspiracy coming landing. I'm anti-vaxxer. threatened never speak cousin get kids vaccinated (she pressure rest family). 

But trust administration. Remember telling us wear masks? Remember pushing dangerous drug (hydroycloriquine) help? 

When South Korea Germany say get vaccine, I'll get vaccine. something liar-in-chief announces right election? hell f'in no. maddening see bar owners suing, sympathy effect pandemic them. suspect bar owners invested (not money) businesses years; watching businesses destroyed.

Bars need closed sake public health. politicians need find ways compensate bar owners remaining closed. doubt many devils detail that. 

But plenty better economists world specialists kind ‘externality’ issue. could real heroes days advising state governments public might structure payments businesses need close stay closed. 

In absence vaccine treatment, ideas like could save lot lives ton money healthcare, first responder disability expenses. 

Edit: typo added paragraphs what’s happening crisis. gets lot us them. Pitching people other. exactly achieve posts. don’t know that’s want achieve though. it’s media achieves. 

I’m thankful danish friends pissed Sweden. lot friends don’t agree strategy baffled it. also lot friends worry it. they’re afraid virus going come Sweden. They’re worried friends family living Sweden. 

I don’t speak Danish well. try it’s obvious I’m Swedish. I’ve zero issues Swedish Denmark crisis. many speaking asking Swedish strategy I’m Swedish. one really treats differently before. Maybe it’s it’s Copenhagen. Maybe angry ones “udkandtsdanmark”. medicine experimental technique recovered people's plasma (because antibodies). think scientists country discovered. still experimental process giving good results. also cheap, need blood donors. Another one

  What's point? Slowing spread virus pandemic important avoiding skin rash. safety issue. Deal it. Yes there's fire, seems reasonable conclude contributed surge. Additionally many people elected stay home height protests also reasonable conclude related uptick could partially offset behavior. parents die. grandparents.. Especially high obesity rates days. pick 5 year old niece school sometimes see 100 parents. Like 3 overweight, bad burbs oregon. high school parents age permanent damage often severe even die. trump conversation? I’m reading right could sounds like T-Cell test difficult versus antibody test. Damn deep, well detailed. Clinton office???.😷 Oh bad, pay enough attention written comment. Thought simulated sunlight outcome   matter fact, there's two continents name America. *cough* Proud Torontonian today! I'd hope 0 faith leader point. death rate thing change due testing patients elective surgery tested. Fortunately level, far. continues drop national scale. Please cite rule thumb? thought reported asymptomatic people don’t spread it? get saying, come on, also writting Florida Man. beleive so. Maybe feels Vader misunderstood victim Palpatine's manipulation? 

I get idea Vader would force-choke anti-vaxers, kicks It’s necessarily genetic. Found Oregonian.  Every death devastating family deals it. That’s numbers don’t show. Comparing sorrows doesn’t make winners anybody. Lowes HD pretty much places go. Pre-pandemic, tore apart bathroom, started building mudroom fitness room among things. early February, told husband virus get real. Take car seats car get everything need home depot now. I'm actually glad stores operating cutting saws supplies always stocked covid. go non-peak times, avoid Saturday Sunday together.  one quick glance map - India Uber universal health care. Wait hold up. defense wearing mask get tested daily, masks used protect others, don’t wear confirmed infected. motherfucker test positive? State live mandated mask usage. understand someone could know. said problem people know they're supposed wear mask, we'll even give one. people want argue it. better yet grown men yelling 16 year old hostesses it. putting walking door taking off. Straight assholes think they're cool endangering everyone including uneducated plain selfish. FREEDUMB! would've known. uptick localized one region. Overall numbers ok. smart quarantine seems job.

They spread would tram. national guard medical staff helping overflow? happened putting fires popped up? reply flagged incivility, know why...

I took picture it,  Yeah, jumping stuff adrenaline. hurt jumping whole flight stairs 14. moved house stairs liked rush. thing... hurt know immediatelly got hurt, unlike catching virus. bit early signal victory flag, agree. whatever reason, number deaths kept up. get ""butts seats"" mentality. long work gets done gets done well matter work? likely last. It’s downward trend quite while, along many states new england. That’s reassuring. I’d rather people think don’t think don’t go putting others risk. problem is, around San Antonio, lot options diverting.. eventually, fly/drive Dallas Houston get full. get national compliance keep 
doing this. really simple.  plan reopening time? Maybe we'll better next time boys!! Gotta plan control instead pretending already business usual. 

 know minimize spread, know track it, acting like petulant, uneducated children. see example WI bars first opened nurse proudly, without mask, socially distancing, told news crew nurse Chicago subsequently fired properly protecting putting patients harms way. Best best! Bars beaches... best best...

History is... well, let's honest. fucking people understand history militant police presence rolled residential neighborhood shot pepperballs civilians porch... nah, they'd cheer side. American exceptionalism excuse lack empathy. 

Sports gonna cancelled. Trumpid(iot)19 Yeah nobody thinks positive test rate population positive rate.

The point know positive rate 5% testing enough finding anywhere near infected. keep reading scary. able bring visit subreddit yet. Tuscaloosa. shocked here. It’s almost school policies made thought professors administrators, many older probably underlying conditions. They’re banking children young adults relatively alright infected. denying testing treatment people sick reducing number tests done?

Remember 80% people test positive show symptoms mild cold-like symptoms, testing pretty irrelevant. might important statistics, individuals.

The vast majority people require treatment virus. half-way there. results Oxford vaccine UK known end year. According microbiologist buddy preliminary data promising, time alone tell efficacy. That's need wait &amp; collect numbers. fyi, vaccine development part equation. Somehow, way US needs produce vials shots distribute them. Think long taken get basic pcr covid testing sites set up, we're able test tiny fraction US residents. Multiply thousand-fold see may take year FDA approval shots widely available everyone. Natural Selection progress. Yup. linked interview main researcher provided. unfortunate enough entitled jerks like you.. 'muh rights!'

I'm going tell go hell, tell go Florida. would fitting kind. Masks don’t work beards! Wait....is really 5.5 years?? actually think WFH middle class last, I'm okay with. Also seems like rich powerful class would virtue signal taking vaccine first letting lower class vulnerable people next. Complete eradication would allow locals go back normal travel outside eradicated zones. vaccine would allow everybody go back normal least 60% got it. Well population % means china india much higher chance pandemics starting there. people like someone blame. Fucking human condition. Know scapegoats impact viruses. dont care human emotion. didn’t think socialite still occupation  honestly understand US didn’t get charges crimes humanity this. would great they'd specify mask goes nose mouth. number people see wearing masks properly really pisses off. Well, I’ve vindicated head CDC. That’s cool, guess? loved quote, too! songs make emotional. “Alabama Pines” favorite, something reminds home. weird nostalgic relationship Shoals grew up. Like, many reasons left I’d absolutely never move back point, I’m also grateful spent childhood really special place.

For reason think Jason Isbell feels similarly it. that’s country music about. mean like Trump trying coordinate Conservative news since became problem? Nothing projection people. Try inventive. I'll give example.

If Biden wins bet ton new articles vaccinee great, really inject everyone 5G make non-Binary gender. 4th July like Memorial day steroids. spike even bigger millions disease spread.

YIKES already evidence hard-hit areas rate continued spread mediated prior infection. Hard hit areas Europe well NYC suggest likely would burn out, given time.

It's good strategy probably needlessly high casualties. [back say infected. said infected they're unlikely require hospitalisation unlike elderly significant chance requiring hospitalisation. Celsius thing it? :) Yeah shi- Nobody saying going easy distributing vaccine globally something tells create vaccine matter months overcome glass shortage. Seems like rewarding bad behavior me. something something US third world country something something So, saying Russians involved but... grift weird way.

A ago read paper basically talking economics spam. Among things made fairly interesting claim: reason many scams really obvious people gullible enough actually follow produce cash ever start path. means scammers spend less time effort people ultimately made money.

I suspect grifters politics learned basically lesson: able identify wedge issue real idiots would get worked about, reliably repeatedly scare giving cash even nothing say anything reality.

And again, that's say Russians spreading stuff. totally obviously dumb may suggest mundane motive well. Love to.

Can't.

On top this, health insurance expensive AF. seriously considering moving EU. kids go state. I’m close Tuscaloosa heard bunch Pennsylvania kids shit. Back Bama kids wasn’t circus, introduce spoiled rich kids North made get crazy. theory we're (an American) prone believe conspiracy theories government constantly shafts us politicians lie us, know believe. government says A, usually works me, I'll opposite A. Everything true opposite said everyone agenda runs contrary best interests. Depending state host laws state possible.  Put front jury lost loved ones Covid perhaps result clear. Thanks! hurt 14 lol Sarcastic? see 75% compliance So, let get right?

You paint fool, yet numbers nearly match state issued.

I get point, obviously. fair? brother-in-law get sit home making $1K+ week, others gonna get $200-300? get keep living lavish life funded government nothing regular people get keep struggling get by? Nah fuck that. take entitled ass get job. delusional think government pay everyone whatever hell want. time man others situation get privileged little bubble join real world.

Forget waves—we decided one big one best./s governor overrides order.

Alas, made go hibernation due showing futility engaging discussions reddit. america I've couple people next lines make comments wearing mask chuckling it. tell ""sorry tested positive last week"" (I haven't). good times watching faces drop suddenly social distancing matters them.

I'm *not* saying believe that, I'm saying literally conspiracy could even rationally work, yet they're burning 5G towers refusing wear masks don’t think data, compares western countries shows us highest positive test rate, backs claim us isn’t bad. could pick another data set might show that, data set shows us worst light compared counties chose. happens every hospital south mason dixon line east rockies reach breaking point time? know takes least 3 weeks case load start dropping- happens 1/4 country cannot go hospital reason 3 weeks? document document document Putin says works.

It isn’t.  Every time anything cia related declassified, shocks reader core. US never even close. Honestly, relieved Doug Ford, sometimes referred ""Trump Canada"" handling properly. least understands viruses care political views, takes advice actual experts. honestly gained quite bit respect way handled this. took us decade since 2008.

This another 10 year downturn. Yes, that’s exactly said. East Asian people don’t value honesty look eye. Oh wait, didn’t.

You’re creating argument that’s there.  Saying certain people value X,Y, Z, might hinder ability doesn’t preclude others valuing X, Y, Z greater lesser degree. 

All I’m saying-or properly, proposing- westerners (in general) tend value looking others face high degree, open face represents honest open dealing, cultural could working wearing masks western culture.

I watched Fuaci's interview, understood exactly meant first said it. agree sounds close lie, lie. need regular people walking around masks/PPE healthcare workers need.

Even last week, majority raiders remaining cars, ones standing outside social-distancing 10-20 feet *and* wearing masks. again, *outside*. Also, u enforce rules local level employees managers denying ppl entry places without mask.

So? decide go anyway, going do? Call police?

Whoops... they're defunded. defunded, according you, instead something completely different slogan people keep yelling. Didn’t 45 say it’ll go away like miracle 😂 I'm racist call CCP ? Wow. calling rat faced make racist since I'm black? hide behind race think I'm immune criticized it. CCP something bad, like lying disease sending people world spread , racist say so. owners lawless dangers society, yes do. people need holding capital.

Pop country gets played radio. I've never able listen like country music. Berkshires bust Wrong. People STILL like them. Posting article said, weirdly express ""like"". odd way looking it.

No, folks saying even greedy robber-barons seeing writing wall. means something. access highest level intelligence alphabet soup agencies provide yet genuinely seems unfazed willing share air entire arenas full people.

and listens one. think makes smart? shows idiot is. listening said beginning? wrong every step way shown absolutely leadership. US worst job coordinated response. Everyone whatever hell want. disaster going get worse.

By way, know several people sick it, including myself, 2 died. Well done Mass! umpteen millionth time since moved away, wish I'd never left. state leaders taking seriously. Singing “...and I’m proud ~~American~~ Example, least know I’m... something....” /s Good luck side effects. Youd nuts take right away. worried extending weekly 600 (which really shouldn’t be, look much spend annually “national defense” zilch keeping American citizens safe/alive) could tier based much state’s max UI payment is, based much one’s state UI payment already is, anything like that. Dropping completely would probably create real, end days national crisis they’ve staving whole time. must extended way.

I know personally lucky enough get UI this, deserving partner gotten caught ID verification hellhole, 600 weekly gone long way supporting thru this. can’t imagine folks children dependents this. taco bell raise wages. Problem solved.

Yup full disclosure saw somewhere quite remember where. Everyone please stop saying full stop. Full stop.  Oh eventually. he'll probably follow trail Ron DeSantis blazed, blame minorities. Or, he'll blame ""young people"", like Abbott TX. guys work, straight Trump's playbook:

Deny, second longer deny it. Then, blame people vote anyways. need assume anything flu, around forever... COVID brand new, obviously need make assumptions it, better err side caution ""lol, YOLO"" genuinely believe boomers mostly die going see shift attitudes. gen xers millennials raised follow beliefs hopefully outnumbered keeping racism prejudices themselves. definitely take time, presidency definitely step back us really really gave racist assholes voice again, least confidence spew bullshit believe them.

That mean try. minimize impact get proper treatments vaccine. Yes, I'm well aware long term issues covid (I some). simply think ways in-person school socially distance time. worth discussing, least. Sounds like school exploring that. Fuck California, Florida, Texas, Arizona. country close, fucking blew Oof, article hurts.

Of course, end day dumb game bunch stupid tribalism, sometimes nice distraction real shit going around world. Thanks. sucks careful week ago. totally understand locked indoors sucjs mental health too. depression actually suicidal tendencies off, meeting friend best I'd felt months. I'm paying it. Off-brand office tape. economy bounce back huge soon get control virus.  Another lock down, vaccine, pretty much everyone following protocols masks distance. economy get worse worse. already shunned countries open trade travel countries got control virus. Nah, bet net worth. billionaires treated matter much otherwise qualify.  It’s nation’s fuck-ups end moving live retired mothers/grandmothers. Holy shit didn’t notice you’re dumbass always claims he’s lawyer lmaoooo Omg yes. fucking young. babies.

And know media portraying cases like they're dumb teens went parties that's we're seeing. mostly children go child care parents working. teens babysitting parents working. siblings.

Sure, number risky cases vast majority fucking depressing parent working. brings home. surprise, congenital heart defect triggered kid asymptomatic ass even know positive. God. begging economy full effect. Better adherence restrictions general, longer restrictions, slower reopening, cautious reopening. Many countries happy go hard early keep numbers down. people wearing masks another thing too. see reason believe either without sources Peasant think government something, learn country, Learn Japan, Singapore, ever , even learn China.   People right important, also rights put others danger.

If US lock completely, efficiently shall small area bounce back.

POTUS talk states , make full plan, mandatory face mask, full static death infection rate. live , shall treat numbers.... make pandemic became like ""The purge"" thing....

Virus look economy, race politically-will. math off. said $100 third utility bill... winning. please tell are.

They hastening demise, infinitely better intelligent, responsible people giving *good* advice live longer keep *fucking shit up*. Lol :( comfort shield? Interesting. Everyone know started wearing one quickly ditched them. They're uncomfortable. Maybe head wrong. mean, numbers answer important questions, answer different questions! keep whats going world live? better job federal government cases.. plan... way remove furlough program save company. I'm sorry, really sucks. furlough policy collective bargaining agreement. way longer valid company declares bankruptcy, thereby voiding contract. opinion, think devolved ""no masks"". wear shoes, seatbelts, etc. hurt least small part prevention wearing mask. Feel free convince wrong. changing mind something cogent convinces otherwise. Let's kinder gentler nation other. Lol motivation!! holy shit lol Lord Farquaad, you? never life seen help wanted signs past weeks said directly related, future tense. absolutely way knowing sure without contact tracing. already mindset people die could gotten anyone protests, discussion already derailed. 

Do think Trump’s latest protest contribute deaths people jammed tiny ass arena? economy hits coming recession mattered. think already virus immune. want see antibody titer. Source this? Isnt much publically traded companies held trust funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension managers, fund managers there's literally reports doctors treating hospitalized COVID patients, trying keep dying, still convinced virus hoax. think Hong Kong considered special case though - got hit pretty hard original SARS outbreak, knew important act quickly. Bosses declared enforce GA reopened April. spike May. spike started June, mass protests. Let's lay blame due, protesters. It’s fuck up. He’s perfectly advancing conservative agenda - deny science, education, media, data, drive wedge neighbors. Anything following established pattern would immediately rejected voting base probably would ended political career. Arizona Texas go back lockdown? think mean if, Greg Abbott live reality all. worried along would completely refuse lock state again. 

Even first lockdown completely half assed. honestly can't even comprehend what's going happen next months here, know completely overrun healthcare system looks like thought might happen scares shit me. clue state look like soon idea going forward.

I got laid two weeks ago due covid phone interview tomorrow, company wants hire mandates office, really know do. would money I've ever made, amount money worth health life. ton savings getting nice severance weeks. taking unemployment, may safer take couple months off, I'm still convinced anyone really hiring right anyway. Panhandle widely regarded complete shithole reason. I'd never caught dead there. That’s brand Alabama. Without financial penalty, dumb people dumb things.

What apparently financial penalty, dumb people never dumb things.

I’d recommend optician.  link states ""it seems summer loss summer gap-growth occur, though universally across geography, grade level, subject."" obviously number kids going remember everything stop studying them, rebound classes resume. Kids continue learn school, leaning math history. summer break kids learn valuable social skills, learn practice hobbies, travel gain life experience grow people. Kids fewer resources disinterested parents naturally benefit less time others. took 10 days go 90k 100k. know every one days news telling us crossing 100k mark. Put image constitution mask wear it. think big part half country looks president role model. Since never wears mask think he’s “telling like is” also don’t want wear mask. countries’ leaders wear masks. Funny, net worth exact score...... higher scores cared first. People told turn AC homes. anyone blame people trusting word U.S. Government anything? track record one staggering deceit to, including Fauci admitting lied world effectiveness facemasks minimizing spread Covid. Though anyone half brain cell knew wearing facemask good move. still, despite claimed nobility reasons, straight lied. I’m sorry say cops don’t want follow orders superiors jobs?


Why accepting that? next question is: extra staff needed maintain surge capacity ICU? 

Edit - already factored “beds” metric? forgot /S Glad read comments first .. Pass FYI almost 3 x amount people Belgium. Much bigger area, cities much bigger too. 

And amazing amount individualist stupid people. genericz countries produced. Gilead given green light 127 countries produce generic resdemevir. America sole country allowed. live Los Angeles without solar panels 3k sqft house. worse heatwave 2 months bill water, electricity, trash collection, sewer 1k. nearly impossible get 1 k bill 1 month residential house  Edgy one would. extreme measures imo, I'm likely either make stuff get go. happen NY pop-up hospitals? Let's hope show AZ quickly enough. edit: yep system place, never activated. Why? change thing majority people. Eventually there'll people social distancing default didnt say classroom. district looking socially distanced outdoor classes. not?

And no, right consistent masks, hydroxychloroquine, transmissibilty, etc One friends alone lost 6+ people close her. another friend whose whole immediate family including got it, throwing guts monitoring day night sis would stop breathing sleep. even going continue beyond that—I barely friends family begin fortunate friends had/have relatively young. 

The media -your- friend. Must nice living whatever dimension one within three degrees it. killed alcohol sanitizers evaporates pretty quick. basically effective rubbing hand short time after. understand eat drink. 

But they’re required wear table. hard. Go bathroom? Wear mask. Get leave? Wear mask. Get ask something? Wear mask. I'm debating validity decision. probably sign things come states. Perhaps primetime I've seen several good cnn reports Texas last couple days, latest reporting says hospitals full, they're creating new covid wards space left one dr said, space world wont help staff resources use they're maxed *now*, let alone weeks Yes, pertinent. call BS. Show stats. Sorry, aren’t allowed travel abroad anymore. won’t need pretend Canadian. Good luck you. thanks sharing perspective. I’m liberal love country music.

Wouldn’t catch concerts though that’s damn sure. also hate going country concerts seeing confederate flags shit. Hate China, pre outbreak, many wore masks due air pollution. happened it’ll disappear summer? Whats really scary think MO we've posting 400+ per day testing virtually nonexistent unless hospital already. Question, 
So let’s say person gym mask, opens mouth , water particles air. Guy walks away. new person walks space guy in. Since virus last three hours air, would likely guy #2 get infected? 
How change happen outside trail? meet 100 people it. call you’re full shit. Nobody believes actually it.

It’s damn flu. flu 2 days you’re worst it. pain, difficulty breathing, feel shitty sore throat cough don’t eat much. lingering effects go 2.5 weeks.

Coronavirus feels like got shit kicked you. Someone beat chest shockingly every breath take hurts. take small breaths minimize pain. cough lot feels like you’re getting punched chest cough. top that, wake pain rolled over. twisting torso hurts. top able breathe well sleep, you’re exhausted.

As point comparison, hiked 22 miles day (5000 ft elevation gain coming started) last year went hiking next day feet, felt fine first hour. coronavirus, ass 3 weeks pain didn’t go away 2.5 months. Lack testing capacity early pandemic. misinformed people powerful/influential positions convincing stupid people big deal.

My gf's aunt nurse telling everyone # cases big hoax. ask heard it, literally say Facebook ends? Oh that's easy...they extend it. pays less 4 weeks 600$ everyone - assuming reduce military spending zero. live Florida. one cities. 

all hospitals empty here.

dude making shit mentioned it, could protests might enforced social distancing measures brought harsher outcomes? so, really makes think. sorry hope pulls through. think nurses hospital staff thinks mask wearing BS ? two anti vaxx/ non mask wearing friends medical field. can't stand them. That's 2.1 trillion dollars 3 months.   States like Alabama Louisiana, least, robust tourism industries, sports, educational facilities point to.

Mississippi (though ""Deep South"") West Virginia lot less going them. Correct far.

So say early cramming 30 plus people small enclosed rooms, seems like good advice follow.

But no, also looking data, data says control. telling kids get back class put fire library, ignoring fact every part building still fire.

Rushing people back get sick help anyone. point let’s read writing wall: we’ve lost fight little chance we’ll stop thing millions infected. We’re getting cases DAY entire countries since beginning. simply way stop point, we’ve already pushed limits people’s patience lockdowns. Americans stupid and/or selfish collectively right thing.

You must accept inevitable fact virus rage mostly unabated 70%+ antibodies. means it’s possible almost everyone know eventually get virus, depending get vaccine. stay hunkered hope one lucky escape herd immunity (either vaccine, mass infection, combo two). Phase 3 fake number That’s Gilead allowed foreign countries produce generic remdesivir. Don’t forget fighter planes built never used thanks Lockheed Martin government contracts! Wahoo! Talk end end encryption banning? heard Marsha Blackburn something need know start calling writing nonsense. It’s something person does, apparently. Fucking love Garth Yea does. number came random sample size around 1000 verified source. also hang people would get vaccine, unfortunately that’s country.

I also hope people figure shit today plan data have

Edit: please never take random redditors assertion fact. want look washington post poll posting methodology you’re curious Coming state near you. Yes, even you. middle class rich folk get scared government going lock down, go home. state. Supported workers rural America commute jobs. share facilities truck drivers. deliver food Amazon.

And could shut again. Congress could start allocating resources. Congress could extend unemployment. also, free COVID-19 health care ending. Congress could lot things.

But House went vacation Senate go vacation.

No one coming. own. saying thing, caught it, everyone needs know someone died. Also, Starbucks tells price front. There's ""I'd like latte."" ""Surprise, that's $800 latte! worry, coffee insurance cover $300 that, pay $500! bargain!"" honestly believe anyone healthcare wearing mask license revoked. believe medicine science licensed expert medicine science? Even better... fired data scientist made state's tracker refused bury data &amp; went create track plus extra getting fired desantis told hospitals stop reporting icu capacity &amp; started pulling local dmissions sources could became harder hold line Riots scale completely dwarf BLM. Especially states start shutting again. false information. Severe cases corona virus would kill patient kill within first 3 days 87% time. Confirmed covid19 came Japan. almost seems like people dying sick, economy better, crazy idea konw! least Chernobyl civilians purely innocent. rona partly blamed worked home 3 months, problem. everybody come back office reason. boss makes joke he's wearing invisible mask. still dev meetings via webex too. I'm pissed. yet wear masks places world. much ‘my body choice’ huh? Lmao somehow isolated Sweden? Tourism elsewhere Europe exactly fluorishing. Dontcha know evil libs tryin save people's lives!!! evil get? Lord Desantis USA seen an, ""Advanced Guide Pandemic"" 

for months now.... I’ll definitely give watch. exercise instead. free. Welp freedumb dums. recent figures antibody prevalence Germany? nevertheless lead people wearing them. Simply stating ""You must/must this"" actually measurable effect. example, prohibition wipe alcohol consumption stretch, lead sharp decrease amount alcohol consumed. 

Even measures lead paltry compliance rate 20-25%, that's big deal. people can’t seem differentiate country’s leadership citizens. average joe simplistic view things happily lug country’s leadership citizens. average person without depth thinking easily blame entire group actions few.
They can’t seem understand fact perhaps citizens responsible everything power curb spread still risk virus incompetent leadership reckless behaviour fellow citizens. 
Also hope family stays safe mate. medical director tried tell better wearing masks wasnt changing every patient, willing allow us do, got wear masks. got fired refusing work conditions asked smoking. Plea authority. logical fallacy. good lying, yes lying, masks do? Besides convince bunch nuts need them? It’s “not great, terrible,” comrade fucked bro. much sucks admit it, look around. idiots won. handled like Camacho Idiocracy put smart guy charge, would fine. C'mon, man. Autism? Autism nothing intelligence clearly need educated Autism really means and/or does. Duck brand glue stick Yeah, think mixed-results studies surrounding effectiveness wearing face mask really hammered idea face masks don’t work. Kinda gross weren’t already. Makes wonder why. Worth going head Dr said. This. would made sense booster unemployment. Rent tied closely to. Cost living would allotted people needed support money rather flushing pockets low cost living areas. work US? stay home quarantine tested positive police check do? Pretty much sums up. They’re phase 1. Early release vaccine compromise safety. Remember folks, strict regulations annoy people. specific previous incidents every extra regulation. guys turn around require lot rethinking society organized economically like 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago. hate sound like luddite oran alarmist, seems idiocy tracks well, rise Social Media. Sally fucking curbside order service shouldnt sally? Come check Mesquite tree's &amp; tumbleweed's. throw free Covid-19. make sure buy plenty Turkey legs Kettle Corn. make $1.5 billion first 500k doses. green even get production ramped up.

Their annual profit $13 billion ... left money spend R&amp;D -- case drug finally working pay research new drugs. 

They charging much run bunch ethically challenged people CAN. Toronto mayor smokes crack plenty eat home? Hey, him. Sorry, outside bets. Question- doctors test people think it? 
I bad sinus allergies, acting weekend, yesterday felt weak, short breath, terrible headache. woke today felt extremely fatigued/disoriented foggy, headache bad threw up. work restaurant decided get tested since I’m exposed lot people every day. 

At doctor, temp 99 taken Tylenol, could higher that. nurse asked symptoms told this, asked around anyone tested positive told wasn’t sure I’m server restaurant. immediately looks like “oh shit”. said okay doctor right in. doctor exam, listened breathe, test. 

So I’m curious, doctors test patients meet certain criteria? kind thought would walk tested exam, glad chance talk doctor. think Trump hides Fauci accident? Trump could've easily win reelection would've shown slightest bit competence nah fuck it. can't see day he's vein wear mask. 

It's bad he's taking whole control him. hope rational people get fuck way. rebuild. Nothing see here, embers. Northeast here. would like put secession option back table Florida. case guys still wanted to. Cold Stone worried appeasing Karen's people's health?


That's bold move places serve food, especially treats kids have. Right, statement ""there 2 billion doses vaccine September"" huge asterisk Y'all keep saying ""full stop"" keep talking. 😂 live USA, yeah that's pretty obvious people around world. K Wow - he’s going get everyone kill Hey there. understand I'm stranger, means anything, feel free reach need anyone talk to. 

I'm sorry struggling, get this. believe you. credit sounds like good time, provided correct
Psychedelics handy. wont bother responding anymore. clearly interested discussion. shilling CCP. Extreme behaviour? elaborate bit? That’s actually scary. 

It’s mind boggling little DeSantis, therefore lot people state, seem care virus. think numbers change anything?  don’t [seem understand Social security solvency... +5 Yo fair, nothing gop mantra since forever. least domestically...they’ve done plenty overseas. pressure pushing me!  come from? It’s education. Educated people demand vote educated representatives make educated policies, answer educated people. Proper education key mess long term, otherwise you’re fighting symptoms uneducated populace vote uneducated representatives create problems take mountains money keep fixing. 

Just clear too, I’m talking throwing everyone 4 year university programs hoping best, creates different set problems guarantee people come smarter. starts things like incorporating critical thinking broadening students’ perspectives, encouraging explore academic interest prioritizing academic success. states / counties / school districts may require / reallocated funding, others requires complete cultural shift structural overhaul. 

Im convinced proper education combined campaign finance reform would solve bulk major problems US, simply implications educated less ignorant population maintaining successful well run society. people complaint wear mask want quickly run store something like that. Maybe hour max. Try wearing 8 hours straight. nearly easy people seem think is. I'm pro-mask, i'm privileged wear one long stretches time. I'm self aware enough understand might different opinion forced wear one day long. Oh yeah, well that's good enough. want example do. want greatest, tremendous, biggest example regarding pandemic. say every student sits overcrowded classroom open bars. Sports starts tomorrow, without limits attendence, need haircut. anything, United States America done world country. innovation, inventions, genuine ideas. provide medical patents save millions lives around world.

Every place problems solved. currently one limelight agree other, resulting nothing done. 

I would never want live Canada put front human rights tribunal said something someone like.


Sadly, believe US soon taken people want censor free speech push one radical viewpoint. (ie. Reddit) intentionally spreading it.. rather neglecting outcome actions. Actually last 3 days 3-day-rolling-averages 290, 238, 211. Last time checked qualify increasing.

Or use d00mer parlance....*ackshually* Much agree this, feel bit unfair highlighting willingness American people ""strip away"" freedoms, fact, egregious thing US' response 9/11 willing sacrifice life tens thousands innocents (both Americans foreigners) *nothing* 9/11 pursue false 'war terror' using 9/11 pretext. Really? see absolutely nothing wrong mass gathering gets mind pandemic

That's got us problem begin with. Every American's mind focused pandemic.  know would incredibly useful determining set field hospitals move supplies. issue Florida's surge kinda happening everywhere - different New York's surge NYC main epicenter. guys still hiring? wanna nurse Lmao...

No. wrong.

This about, beds people heart attacks. doctors? busy Covid patients too. envision entire army Karen's coughing general direction Toronto Honestly heard enough stories lot anxiety going in. wasn’t big deal all, I’m pretty squeamish. trying trigger jews? Muslim? Lame. dig deep kpop industry. end pretty dissapointed never laid blame anyone particular, welcome believe whatever like.

Most businesses reopened immediately April, weird see full impact 2 weeks later. However, rate start increase 2 weeks reopening (well protests). 

I suspect combination things, including protests also reopening state, movement states open, quarantine fatigue, people dropping guard masks/distance.

Regardless WHY, seeing increase using lessons learned states hit hardest. Make orders trickle do. tenants getting lenience evictions/rent etc, landlords getting lenience mortgages it’s over.

Problem is, whenever actually expire don’t see everyone magically catching bills once. We’ve definitely got severe economic situation hands Someone takes complicated, difficult-to-understand information repackages ELI5 format us stupid folk. 

 
On reddit, would good example.

On youtube, [Two Minute 


Well-known examples Bill Nye, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Anthony Fauci. Honestly worst offense allowing politicians address public science Trump’s nonchalant attitude everything—not wearing mask social distancing, spewing lies, false numbers ignorance. believe lot people saw thought “hey, he’s meeting people close quarters wearing mask despite one people supposed danger virus. that, it’s bad nothing worry about.” Despite number people know he’s full shit, lot people listen president feel like trustworthy. 

Not mention early propaganda wearing mask doesn’t help unless you’re sick already—we know that’s true, really gave people didn’t want wear mask anyways ammo. people don’t realize they’re sick yet going around spreading 2 weeks, maybe even longer without symptoms feel don’t need mask. 

Then there’s people don’t give fuck.  Sure were. monkey states go little lax There's still plenty pandemic left still nothing. Best hope national coordinated response might come January. Maybe. fucked. Masks stop capital becoming whatever Akira-like monster becoming. least stave fking pandemic feel like bigger part people think. However, first response feeling guilt isnt lashing out, def see people live city Texas. Last week, number active cases city doubled. week number tripled. You’re spot exponential rate increasing. deaths lag new cases 2-3 weeks, start seeing death number increasing rapidly probably week now. getting pretty severe. Agreed, I'm still sure feel either. points raise illustrate things simple black white. think Congress best could time constraints had. Right wing populist movements Sweden overexaggerated, particularly masochist Westerners online. Sweden constant underlying liberal ""pity-racism"" ""stupid uneducated"" immigrants dumb understand follow Swedish mentality. Sometimes slips verbally. immigrant Sweden, would know. Yeah, initial Ebola vaccine made *more* susceptible get disease! Fuck inbred parasites.

Royalty 21st century? Primitives.

Hey, still dragons &amp; wizards too? old corrupt fuckwads replace them, fret! ‘news’ outlets need closed owners held responsible slanted BS they’ve spread years

I would pay unbiased news like choices US get chose various bags crap think using 'Boomers' blanket term old people. Gen Xers older people seem think likely ones spewing lot hate misinformation Facebook. Gen Xers 50s now. can't win :( Thanks trolling guess. least make sure get tested negative beforehand!!!  kind mask? fact matter ZERO evidence back claims protests contribute current spike cases. 

More like fact matter zero evidence protests contributed significantly current spike, bunch evidence it. mental gymnastics convince people did? Protests outdoors dense lots masks. doesn’t take rocket surgeon figure aren’t much issue indoor bars. 🤦‍♀️ Go Rona! Show Florida Man who's boss! Mmm ya probably smoking crack years ago March 2020

I 'member. Awesome opinion, we're gonna see lot corperate bootlicking, form ""oh black people matching bandaids"" streets renamed, much way police reform makes dent society's problems. 

I mean, states better others, right, it'll like 3 most. I'm NYC seen spike protesters. They're outdoors wore masks. new case spike due indoor bars imo. I'm asking you. would work
Unfortunately psa campaign needs centralized support current administration cares downplaying  lot people responding seem realize often not, flu vaccine 50% effective given year. Someone please correct I'm wrong, multiple (I think four) strains flu possibly vaccinated against. year virologists predict strain prevalent one given. would say years, protects less 50% people catching flu. 25% fewer people catching disease global scale still makes HUGE difference, especially something viral SARS-COV-2. week ago mentioned state numbers going down, got downvoted. 

Who's laughing Reddit?! Buy rumor, sell news. That's always been. Idiots country black men. Ha!  many people eat shit right now.  masks help, don’t negate risk. Besides, protestors wearing masks, they’re certainly practicing social distancing. facility doesn’t epic/cerner/meditech/etc type products? That’s doubtful. It’s also system level addition facility level. clinical outcomes improvement work done system level. would work retail job new york minute needed provide family. true care ones older them. looking forward inherit house old family members.

But idea sparsely populated areas gonna issue nonsense. look epicenters are. There's clear pattern. lol--and nurses? seem floating awful lot nurses Covid floors. almost lot folks sick. /r/everyfuckingthread Apparently pandemic already going December 2019 kept spreading couple months finally discovered.

When cases started tracked looked like spreading fast, truth already widely spread.

I think Chinese delays local government understanding high risks late TFW Abrahamic religions literally death cults. really resonates me. Thank insight. Nah, playing game. Watch closely happens next weeks. wait last possible hour, team red put cares act 2.0 Gump come looking like polished turd. 

You forget easy sway people. fact.

RemindMe! 6 months They're actually angry *the world*.

Their lives great, understand why, know little chance ever understanding. grab control can... whether comes joining group support President people hate yelling people wearing masks gives chance feel they're right once, something feeling.

If unhappy time world sucks can't understand why, get frustrated angry enough lash chance get. #1) fly rockets ISS

Seems like everyone bang-up job following rules. directed social distancing stickers removed AZ. want stay home forever don’t you? saying choice live affect choose continue living recluse?

Don’t go outside you’re still terrified, don’t ever go outside anything trust believe things contagious dangerous.

I you, terrified, didnt believe doubts. seeing k seen experiencing (which someone said personal experience meaningless something, nice) believe numbers TV. don’t. doesn’t add knowing hospitals get money based number corona patients among things, lOgIc trust numbers. simply saying CHOICE. don’t know makes people think insulting calling names ok.

Hatred bigger problem apparently prevalent sub, type attitude caused hurt pain throughout history pandemic. Thank you! I'm tired people calling ONE source gave solid chance winning inaccurate.

Shit. Imagine snow-flake. person helping guide policy. ignored. Yep. Yet Trump claims ""cupboards left bare"" Obama administration. Even though 31/2 years administration. get saying, clear Trump never capable handling properly. Short removing Trump Pence office, always going mega-debacle. never going change someone's mind confronting social media. Also Texas sparsely populated areas.  stuck small office nose people. bummer.  I'm hoping HOPING July 4th going disaster think going be. :-/

its going shitshow. Yes! doctor secretly starts treating red level drugs blue level. 

Episode: Critical Care
Description: 

The Doctor's mobile emitter stolen Voyager alien trader named Gar sold overcrowded hospital run hardnosed Administrator Chellick. Doctor activated told get work patients overcrowded underequipped level ""Red"", protests kidnapping, must comply due Hippocratic oath.

The Doctor quickly learns hospital run strict manner computer called Allocator, regulates doses medicine patients based Treatment Coefficient (TC) value assigned patient. told TC based complex formula reflects patient's perceived value society, rather medical need. One patient, Tebbis, terminal condition requires drug hospital provide, Tebbis's TC low warrant it. Doctor begins question system, Allocator assigns level ""Blue."" Level Blue's facilities quality care dramatically better modern got place work opened back up. time got unemployment sent funds, already back work, got weeks worth. paid usual wage stuffed rest bank. need before, it'll give nephew great Christmas. :D Nope. Imagine post something completely different completely different context. That's feel bubble might actually safer lot guys. players quarantining. parties going parks. -(The US) Seeing things like “young people aren’t risk so... back beaches everyone!” Followed articles read “new study finds people never fully recover may suffer COVID damages rest lives” unreal... Canadian, assure freedom speech. you’re trying say is, wouldn’t want live Canada may held accountable hate speech. You’re one radical viewpoint, unfortunately you’ll never see way. LOL ejected beer nostrils reading this. tried flatten curve, work. Time rip band aid let everyone get move on. Ah, yeah. They're similar boat ours. Sorry hear it. one boiled masks vs masks. authorities always advised wear masks maintain social distance. United States million coronavirus deaths end year, guaranteed. 4th July + schools reopening + football season + overall American stupidity recklessness = complete total disaster BS.

This customer service issue, wear damn face mask right thing issue.

Wear mask, entitled ice cream. Another good part compared leading vaccines (such one worked Moderna), Inovio's vaccine easy store transport room temperature. vaccines need stored -80, difficult do, especially underdeveloped nations. forget Bill Gates new Soros.

Microchip vaccinations? sitting me?

They not. CDC doesn’t count death numbers Florida. reported state. different Florida’s pneumonia #s compared previous years ? got clickbait, event happened October 2019.

Seriously article looks like well written piece propaganda written Goebbels himself. Personally know somebody works AZ governor — asked possible shut-down state — 


He smugly told “not gonna happen” 


Kinda glad it’s actually happening old friend (very healthy 51yr old) pretty mild case. 4 days feeling terrible quickly back normal. Started getting dizzy month later got lung xray. Ground glass signature never pneumonia breathing problems. makes nervous. need lungs top shape favorite hobbies. people dont want stay home, rotting away watching netflix months end.

Those selfish people many people's lives ruined right now. 

Omg horror staying home watching Netflix day. OMG Gitmo shit right there. /s 

You sound like typical selfish, ignorant American. reason country considered ""shithole"" Europe. years Europe opens Americans going get virus control. majority work white collar job. 

That government done like Canada Europe. Offered America people financial assistance. Italy Spain practically beg european union money.

Their COVID cases lot lower ours. soon hit 100,000 new cases day. 

Our economy still going collapse enough control spread. Hundreds thousands people going die. Agreed, somewhat disingenuous make blanket statement overall market mostly recovered losses, imo.

Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, etc. ripped all-time highs past months.

Meanwhile, airlines 50%, hotels 40%, banks 30+%, non-Tesla carmakers down, real estate down, restaurants down...

The feds pouring tons money economy, still thing that's really ""recovered"" tech.

The ""overall market"" held seems like pretty obvious tech bubble. bursts, things get real bad. [WHAT NINE I’m gonna go ahead press X doubt one. Wasn’t long ago Ducey Abbott stance forced backtrack week later. DeSantis looking $$$$ right now...tourism $$$$, NBA return Orlando $$$$ thing is, sooner later that’s going crash. things won’t happen people keep getting sick works God Prosperity. smh.... players want money opportunity title. dont want 62 exhibition games. good, case numbers traditionally rise week reporting gets backed-up weekend.

Brazil 55k day couple weeks ago. might break Friday. Obama never re-ordered N-95 masks depleted swine flu. Holy shit, case cracked Dad. come greatest country earth writes article seems happy Covid infected nationally months, zero death certain state? might, tbh, political responses imo.

This kinda olive branch EU handing China say, hey let's play kick Murica aside.

But definitely going sort quarantine policies place govt let EU citizens China, already C-3 visa. sure EU agree it. VOY Season 7 Episode 5, ""Critical agree, understand. One day spike *so far* Double upvote Yeah that, would CEOs wealthy shareholders purchase new mega-yachts? /s Every American's mind focused pandemic.

But give full attention AR15s? hit peak 10 days total lockdown. Texas gone lockdown. things continue get worse keep getting worse do. see good time that? strict, federally mandated shut downs (I believe anyways, Canada, EU places definitely this, not, every single province completely shut anyways) went mid-March early June (Ontario got malls back past weekend still indoor dining all), instead mid-March late April / early May like USA (and federal mandate, states nearly locked others). mask wearing encouraged universally levels government, helped aherence believe, still could looooot better here. Also people seem lot respectful physical space/distancing here, grocery stores rare someone get within 5 ft you, unavoidable, they'll never grab something shelf whatever right next you, they'll wait finish taking long time they'll politely ask grab something quickly. check lines distanced 2 / 6 FT apart people adhere universally. stuff like that. course there's exceptions grocery store points, point exceptionally rare. Since running, elected, I'd say, ""I'm American I'm voting/didn't vote him!"" There's much embarrassment take. find works well. many people tell accent I'm from, say carefully, like they're embarrassed me. ""Soooo, American?"" bets then? total control

Enough already inanities. normal unemployment $48 week I’m server. DUde, screenshots email author fully identified. Maybe right possible scam. lot people want nothing burger. 

I promise hospital administrators, greedy are, filling ICUs 100% billing. -(The) Still baffles many people discount effectiveness wearing mask.

I'm underestimating virus imagine virus twice deadly, still makes wonder people would still follow rules precautions. US examples become ? rotors? thoughts exactly. many people pointed Georgia... whoopsie getting information, Mexico top 5 finding supports current Centers Disease Control Prevention recommendations healthcare facilities encourage patients influenza-like illness surgical facemasks one component influenza infection control program 

The general public healthy influenza like illness. There's reason healthy people wear masks. findings suggest homemade mask considered last resort prevent droplet transmission infected individuals, would better protection. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2013;0:1–6) 

Infected people coughing sneezing stay home, go public masks. even read copy pasta'd?

&amp;#x200B;

Your last study computer model. actual data scientific method showing cloth face masks filter viruses, ignorant idiots making assumptions computer models titles names pay attention them. ""The U.S. become example *TURN WHAT!?*"" KS it’s practically back normal already. flaw ""logic"" choices people make concerning highly communicable disease still endangers others. choose wear sunblock, run risk suffering cancer. catch you. others choose practice unsafe sex, consequences you.  cases much isolated larger community setting. consequences would consider poor choices individual much widespread impact community.

However, people make poor choices larger consequences, tend reprimanded way. People already made poor choices listening adhering simple safety guidelines suffering consequences. health, economically, number ways. that, others suffer them. 

You say people choice stay home? say people choice give damn others. Maybe did, we'd better off. would also help pressing humanitarian efforts, it?  read headline first two comments gives breakdown. thank work. 😉👍 China seems real problem getting 1.4 Billion people voluntarily comply strict lockdown starting Jan 23 Wuhan, Jan 25 nationally. entire country ""stay home"" quarantine, one designed person going food medicine every days. stopped virus spread.

China tried targeted lockdown Beijing, like 5 million 50 million.

If China says need lock 50 million people, people probably comply, because:

1. before.
2. worked
3. China ask unnecessarily

When people trust government, government serves people, pretty good n 3 weeks since protests began. Study show responsible increase cases. UK we've continually decreasing cases.

Outside transmission incredibly low compared indoor. good downward trend sudden starts spiking again. Daniel Romano ..... recent discovery mine playing nonstop. Covid: gift keeps giving... RTFA No, mean US gives handouts countries world, yeah, that’s one. simple thank would suffice. ad remains one disgusting campaign ads I've seen. 

Absolutely shameless. *loads shotgun* get back ya came What's worrying Texas huge, meaning lot people Texas *naturally social distant* supposed slow epidemic (Some Rural European regions almost got case school office closed). consequence huge factor huge delay hospital able deal COVID. 5h ambulance barely able breathe sounds like fun experience. ones stock dropping. fed keeps injecting capital economy. Don’t look toward stocks make sense right now. Every type news bullish good bad. Gilead licensed Remdesivir charge multiple manufactures distribute cost underdeveloped nations. known long time already. higher level prospects fine really sucks middle-lower tier guys.   1/3 saying get one vaccines never 100% effective. hesitant get one. much notion pandemic reducing negative impact environment... Well fuck, probably right. careful specify chart shows ""available beds"", without specifying means. China January: people wear masks shunned, arrested, beatened.

White regimes February: beats Asian looking people wear masks.

That tells everything need know. kept much Turkey I'd say guys handled fairly well. mean 5,000 deaths quite low especially compared European countries like UK, France, Italy etc. also quite low number deaths population size. think guys closed things like schools etc quite early probably helped. cases rise bare mind deaths lag would also depend testing positive. mean Germany high number cases managed avoid high number deaths preventing high risk groups catching it. Way early see impact indoor dining, think. officially allowed week ago, restaurants necessarily ready throw open doors day 1 (they got days notice). Plus, lot people still reluctant dine indoors. Personally, intention going restaurant anytime near future; sticking take-out now. Yes, 100%. describe sensation really well. Let in
LET IIINNNNNN! like lead example. solely blaming Americans Canadians thinking? Interesting... covid related since lesson low turnout Tulsa means rallies need modified put covid scenes**: White House heaped blame Trump campaign small turnout Tulsa, even though president adamant making large rally happen immediately earlier team thought prudent.  president's advisers admit privately underestimated scared elderly supporters would join indoor, mostly mask-free crowd, without social distancing.  Trump campaign quickly figure make rallies work age coronavirus.  old way rallies basically telling Glassner go get done, approach collapsed Tulsa. larger team expected handle Trump rallies going forward, myriad additional considerations including legal liability, health guidance local government regulations. reacting perfectly, obviously care gets sick brings apartment. can't kick leave safe. Smart move imo yet athletes think essential continue seasons middle pandemic. Even chance permanent lung damage damage....... Cool. that. charge design well construction, DM you’re serious.  guys great work. strip clubs food served. clubs stay open feeling rigging elections. Nothing he's ever done suggests wont try dig elections.

If somehow can't.... honestly see voluntarily stepping down. Yea expire 7/17, I'm already far hole, might well go way. betting evictions causing panic extra unemployment money burns out. I'll never learn lesson lessons trying make market predictions logic times. one stings little already hearing ""since rona shit didnt pan made new one panic people"" &lt;~ literal quote. way hedge governments funbux... can. course, solution all.  9501 Could build around New England

Sincerely Rhode Islander whose state also worked hard lower infection rate Lol fucking joke. covers one month rent, maybe food I'm lucky. laughed bit
Then got sad 
Stay safe Yes it’s weird! too. Im certain also wasn’t sick her. like tried bend tie shoe hard breath chest/back would hurt feel stuffy?

Europe reopened already, countries suffering consequences. Italy Spain practically beg european union money. would collapse without it.

for example! mess Stock market little happening now. matters investors think going happen future, apparently investors don’t think we’ll lock next year.

I mean would rather market go down, means little short term, quite frankly is. 

But coronavirus perspective, stock market matter us 736 deaths today. Trump fires Comey hes fucked enforce every seat rule airlines, few. Yeah, I’m done tacit judgements We’re giving away trillions important cruise lines, guys! get advice medical experts admit really can't envision 100,000 people even 10,000. Americans decades. Bay Area also really bad. people wear masks hanging neighbors friends social distancing all. heading bad time high rates infected. rate, annoying covid-19 commercials going come back!  Look could gotten together American people. absolutely could quarantine wore masks everywhere absolutely done could have. leadership federal government state government would gotten together as. political system broken quite frankly board due corrupt power bungrh politicians (lets real power constructed tbis way term limits, career politicians??) even come together midst pandemic. 

The issue two party system leaders screaming everything fake lies lies lies every God damm day. really surprising unfolded like this. Super disappointing least surprising Florida literally told reason go provide many examples people gathering indoor areas. Sure, say ""not refraining social distancing gathering indoors."" better you?

I still think pretty dubious people outside spreading long we're talking going beach hiking gathering backyard BBQ everyone touching stuff standing around close proximity. Ok, protests started 4 weeks ago needs cliff notes Reddit notes aka comments. See, Nobody Cares

 reopen 2020 political leaders abandoned us.

I know everyone hoping closed door conversations happening not. Uh guys reelected Bush invaded Iraq. Still worse anything Trump done

It never fringe Oh mandated, live many precautions taken curve flattened, slowly reopened still kept things low. Im exactly surprised America way been. Umm Health welfare citizens absolutely enforceable.  Local officials ignore Abbott’s orders enforce lockdowns anyway. What’s going it? Send troops? Honestly I’ve already seen multiple people worldstar getting laid wearing mask. I’m violence imagine COVID-19 thing America live greedy ignorant fucks wearing masks, people get folks line one way another. agree. I’m one supported reopening (but masks, proper distancing, etc) numbers low, even soft “lockdown” measures. Now, watching cases rise, I’m wondering stock groceries shit really hits fan. sure. says something right there. wanted say hi Knox Co! Citation needed. reddit. think made valid points. language conversational, feel captured sentiment many feel unique time divisiveness uncertainty. girl leaves dog dies theres nothing left give fuck not? thing different language SF Bay Area seeing massive surge part problem families, kids people work given social distancing masks.  

It going ugly Bay Area soon. SF people still careful. Even did, cloth masks going effectively prevent spreading virus.

But become jaded. mask forcefield. mask stop getting hands infecting yourself. mask really protects extremely rare event direct mouth mouth transmission. think % infections actually come versus people touching things previously touched? I'm betting low.

Fact people need stay inside much possible. fact talking masks right height stupidity because, anything, gives people false sense security.

To sure, I'm advocating wearing mask. wearing masks high list priorities compared shelter place. [Simpsons government chosen fund schools based attendance. Even suspending kids funding lose kids absent. used keep kids home pink eye live, longer. Throwing fever drew line. even keep track teachers setting goal lower given sick days. seen proof immunity yet, see he's suggesting herd immunity going happen. supposedly hard make. Sad thing US probably need places since global epicenter anti-science stupidity. guess wear mask except youre eating (thank you) [Close. Homer said something mention guarantee contracted virus past immune getting again. fact, new evidence points immunity dissipating within months. Oh worry, got one idea really scary.  Politicians need accept answers come science, politicians.  think virus going away soon need guidance scientific community, man white house incapable saying wrong usually discovering someones who's song really like spotify radio daily mix random song radio like. That's discovered Townes Van Zandt, John Prine (Saw December still sad passing) went real old school one Marty Robbins. 

I listen tomorrow tiny apartment working home lol know virus yearly mortality rate end being? exponential growth knows final tally be? sure hell 200k. really took mid-March, going four months. Second wave 1918 epidemic worse first. Mutations might increase lethality decrease it. probably scientists loathed put concrete certainties it. continue surprised evolving, affecting human body ways they've never seen before. 

That might explain reaction. may get mild case, may kill you. may recover, may problems rest life. hospitalized US likely financially devastating. necessarily dying, uncertainty capricious nature beast goes far beyond raw numbers. Maybe mayor worry what's happening porch USA nah, everyone likes upvote good news even though almost always says something like ""probably"" title. Smart Gov. cost producing drugs R&amp;D. drugs fail, one successful drug pay 100-1000 drugs worth R&amp;D. scientists expensive. aren’t responsible coddling idiots.

And goes right, Europe vaccine October per AstraZenaca deal. thought America greatest country world making mask... Uh. anticipate apparently long-lasting lung kidney damage infection, we'll get lot ""deaths attributable COVID-19"" 20-40 years. tens thousands new cases daily current point, going sobering reminder next generation even alive pandemic still potentially losing friends family members were. Ohh! Good one!  Yeah, honestly inverse seems give clear depiction me. steroid found couple weeks ago supposedly significantly helps treatment. fact we're still hovering around death rate despite good news. Apparently there's already shortages it. Take away continue increase cases deaths absolutely start increasing. I'm really non confrontational guy, shit ever happen me, asshole would getting finger. Especially second time. right. America $500,000 bill inflated insurance deductions, assuming even mediocre insurance, might cool $30-50,000 spread four years payment plan. damn expensive sushi nonetheless. Well, opened lot indoor areas. 

This reason surge. part it. SF Bay Area, suddenly children families get together time masks distancing. Playgrounds used now. High school younger kids hang friends. Familes get together adults get together precautions. Kids sports teams practice precautions. Gyms open workplaces open (some). would say, instead ""opening indoor areas"" massive reduction social distancing. families kids spread virus, addition spreading work places.  

Masks needed people socialize. one part, help lot. I’m wondering market we’re talking I’m still overall quite bit since even week ago. Difference overweight morbidly obese. totally agree first part, think last part comment bit exaggeration. 

While systemic racism discrimination towards Blacks US major problem real thing, US trying exterminate shit like ethnic genocide (looking China). 

The fact protests BLM US means there's still hope. truly dystopian country one would protest. Racism would norm **no one** would care. one largest medical centers world here, still, bad news bears. Someone needs explain FDA means would 50% ineffective.  blame common core.  confirm.

Depressing true. Lol. extent communication skills? Took 3 replies label uninformed arrogant person. Great buddy, keep up.

To OP. virus kill young healthy. light pre condition even aware of. already hapening.

To anti vax: fuck lie y'all miss poking fun us.  Like herd immunity seems heading quite frank hate break USA entire world. global pandemic global level hence likely years called off. global pandemic called entire/vast majority world safe.

That’s literally point, pandemic going going 2 years mean life won’t back normal. 

Jesus Christ people Reddit. really need get site. hosting blood drive Red Cross next week told us still liberal hoax sure costing us alot money unnecessary medication. Fuckin orange idiot. Yeah, considering that's money actually work us! honest, think explain whole thing trailing, although certainly factor. Roughly 25% total US cases added June whereas ""only"" ~15% total US deaths added June, similar disparity growth rates two figures tracked month-long sliding window since May.

Most likely younger case population lower mortality, well better preparedness evidence-based treatments hospitals play here. hopefully much steeper curve April would needed see daily deaths 2k+ again. 

Of course even take account severe morbidity experienced people still ultimately survive COVID-19 permanent damage definitively know well future. So, data somewhat reassuring, ground level, nothing really changes. Wear mask! Social distance! part prevent spread. protesters wore masks. Things flattened people stayed home. want about, masks necessary. Getting point? Look behind you. they're convinced every goddam bleed Ebola. know?

Yep. Zebras plague young docs 😁 mean exactly word well, shows im sitting 0. honest question though. saying OP said exactly seen people say something effect ""every death needless avoidable took precautions"" reality comfortable level fatalities things, eventually draw line precautions. Many Americans decided even 130k deaths months isnt worth much precaution, im exactly surprised thats all. Heart disease actually kills people comparable timeframe deaths could also hugely mitigated, lot people isnt worth it. saying thats good, saying im extremely thankful American, yes absolutely last point, serious virus. Yup. Trickle economics term coined David Stockman. Shit rolls hill. Money stays wealthy. least one gym issued citation police refusing shut down. Prove aren’t. stock market this

Gonna interesting see plays EU upcomming fall/winter. High income states country generally subsidize low income states national fiscal perspective. see, coming fortunate parts country (have lived coasts), conceptually mind - we're supposed team all. infuriating though folks states constantly scream ""makers vs. takers!"" us we're ones subsidizing them.

I never forgive sentiment Hurricane Sandy hit Northeast disaster relief aid political game ""we can't afford it"", tornadoes hit Oklahoma suddenly funding needed. fathers grandfathers live there? Strange.  even point people like you? mop floor whatever you’re shut up. No, predictions accurate 2016. would inaccurate gave Trump 0% chance win did, didn’t happen. 

538 actually gave Trump BIGGEST chance winning final days election (see: 

It’s forecast. predicted likelihood event happening. something like 67% likely Hillary would win 33% likely Trump would win. words, given ten outcomes, Hillary would win 7 (roughly) Trump would win 3.

None anti mask people logical reasons viscerally opposed things associated ugly little yellow non people. Exactly, malls open doesn’t mean people spending even going . short resurgence people thought okay go back COVID lol (not really funny). It’s broad statement downward trend continue long time, idea dig 40 million unemployed. guaranteed job military, seems like war China definitely table. Idk man sucks.  yup, thats did. Fun fact! Even powerful military world, think current leader wouldn’t damn thing either things. want put emphasis something, MANY people China virus first started absolutely refused wear face masks. even required worn driving inside car.

There many videos sent people living China showing team 3-5 government workers full white hazmat suits dragging people cars arresting refusing wear masks.

There's one video lady's head caught seat belt breaking neck yanked died spot. heart breaking. whole family car her, including looked like 2 young boys back.

The difference was, China especially saying ""i care personal 'rights' national emergency right now. cause ruckus imprison punk ass. people major cities first happened swearing government thought big joke, US. people also circulating people collapsing dying streets, coughing blood dying operating tables, videos overcrowded hospitals add government's ""follow law persecuted"" tone, people took seriously.

my family living shanghai bought full biohazard chemical warfare masks venturing outside. risk contamination also risk police, arrest defiant ass lol appreciate respectful disagreement. I’d like bring up, though, there’s possibility covid lasting effects people even get better. idea may be, course. However, seen many stories reddit people experiencing fatigue recurring sickness months infected covid. something would affect age groups, old already sick.

Socially distanced schools also difficult problem one would first imagine. now, schools simply many people/too large class sizes accommodate social distancing. schools, mine included, planning offer hybrid schooling fall; half-virtual, half person. would decrease class sizes. However massive strain teachers, many guidance administration go virtual. They. Were. Warned. evidence believe numbers?  need insurance another horrible industry charges die. Got it. Like MIL, thinks made make trump look bad even though tested positive, allowed hospital see dying (not covid) father.

You lead horse consequences idiocy, can't make fucking moron.

At least think that's saying goes... people need watch HBO show. 

Every lie incurs debt truth, sooner later, debt paid. pathetic crowded third world countries kind numbers. meaning regards covid specifically yes also true! Tennesseean, upvoting word masshole lol everyone agree weight issue? You’d look specifics, part saw mocking pompous tone. recent rally.  believe China US Masks mandatory avoid death - me. 

PS: I'll fight it. You’d look specifics, part saw mocking pompous tone. recent rally. really. lot cases officials took seriously start. great, terrible. influenza, too.  fucks sake thing get go? 
God help us pieces shit anywhere near leadership pandemic higher fatality rate. MERS? would end human race anything it. hope opposite kind dad want see anyone home, feel bad small time landlords. absolutely ass-fucked orders. want learn type sentence? mask comes in! ""There stigma using mask obscure weak jawline."" Yea screwed happen Trump followers find low score? one people start shooting hold people hostage get care wonder they'll still ""good people""?

The sad thing saw coming March are. According 538 Trump's approval rating still 40%.... That's insignificant. Thanks. Part motivation also us mask encounter don't. 

But moreover, think important lose hope people, matter uninformed. end day, community really need act like one survive. many clinical colleagues drained emotionally physically form this, really hope things change soon pretty spent. Idk going news scientific source. scientists.  lmao wtf? delusional Yeah, need 80% achieve herd-immunity. heard optimistic statements yet topic. me, worrisome thing vaccine—that enough population get it, we'll still fucked. Maybe. ventilators may run car crashes usually need them. Plus different doctor skills for.heart attak covid. unless heart covid affected time normal patients. lungs blood? Plus heart nurse may trained want covid icu er duty. specialties . need feel better people dying conservative ""I empathy situation directly impacts me."" syndrome.

(Yes know NH Massachusetts, control too).  super impressive lot ways lately. 2018 Olympics like huge beacon hope. Agreed. even first wave restrictions started ease. Certain areas saw steady numbers slight decline (in northern CA), never really crushed it. revealing America depths average Americans stupidity selfishness. Appeals ignorance really come naturally you! AMERICA can't nice things one take seriously. sister coming tommorow one states absolutely following (which endorse). dont see enforced people dont care. We've done great job last couple months. 

We actually overcounted previous days officially 0 (or actually negative), people die today COVID19 MA. headline misleading, spirit good. Oh no, someone made relevant point can't counter logic reason. Let's bring Nazis, teach 'em. thank Karen's Ken's feel need use language like that? necessary. Here's simple numbers:

1st Possible US Case: Jan-Feb

1 Million: April 28th (~4 months)

2 Million: June 11th (~1.5 months)

3 Million: ???

If guessed July 10-12 (~1 month), DING DING DING!

I know brain tells you, brain says, ""YOU'RE FUCKED"". South-East Asian countries like South Korea Japan, whose populations widely using face masks, containing virus well without even need rigorous lockdowns?

Every country face masks widely used virus much better control, every country widespread mask usage fares worse, independent economic political factors.

The theory face masks collecting virus work people actually change masks use reusable ones wash regularly. Also, everybody wears mask, amount viral load gets exhaled people severely reduced, large enough load possible infection can't even form masks get washed replaced. 

The simple surgical cloth masks we're supposed wear also shown cause breathing difficulties even people respiratory problems like asthma. people claim always parents use children's illnesses order ignore masks, never even tried giving children mask asked children feel mask usage.

My brother example heavy asthma weakened lungs due severe lung inflammation child. wear simple surgical masks daily shopping without problem.

**Stop spreading lies masks, endangering people.** Uh, really much consensus effectiveness/duration immunity recover? think big part fear. easier ignore truth pretend like isnt happening rather accept really fucked situation next year+ (and possibly ++++) anyone still listening guy admitted lying public face masks order cover incompetence institutions? It’s almost refusing accept science lethal consequences... wish parties. Try houses. apartments. dorms.

College students basically packed towns like sardines. Probably sleeping within fifteen feet like 4 people average. Well information next big wave might well include it. good thing vaccines don’t need rely *other* people cooperate (like masking up), take you’re done. They're happy enough watch 125 thousand people die, give fuck pissing people off. Pretty sad state affairs people getting free money likely send people chaotic rage, death 125 thousand fellow Americans makes feel nothing. You’re wasting time even rights. Comfort. 1.8% - 2% death rate tested positive. Still sounds like flu. **The TL;DR**: study covers **efficacy non-medical grade** masks.

**Results - Droplet Distance Traveled Via Emulated Cough Wearing:** 
**No mask** \- 8 ft. (244 cm) 
**Bandana** \- 3 ft. 7 in. (109 cm) 
**Folded Cotton Handkerchief** \- 1 ft. 3 in. (38 cm) 
**Stitched Quilted Cotton Mask** \- 2.5 in. (7 cm) 
**Cone-style Mask** \- 8 in. (21 cm)

Also, here's [Youtube layering effective mask materials. Cancer: 584,881 people per year

I literally know woman stage IV breast cancer whose chemotherapy regimen completely disrupted stupid-ass response COVID. goddamn moronic. wasn’t sure looked breitbart covid news way page, really it’s prescient event readership right now. None political culture war stuff impact directly.

Weirdly enough Drudge opposite. Anyone know why? They’re almost “liberal” news outlet now.  Finally coworker take seriously last weeks. Thing is, people know someone - whether they’re hospital diff story .. everyone know, knows someone covid. Survival fittest. People like country music aren’t fit. 😉🤣 point worth making would make honestly instead lying.

Why want see people sick suffering? Oh beat it!   ths started crunched numbers - stats said expect 2 MILLION American deaths. seen nothing concrete convinces different outcome. Bottom text don’t get welded homes don’t wear mask. discuss that? /s preparation materials probably form evidence court case needs come this.

128 thousand deaths far, someone needs pay lessons need learnt. would make sense. thinking doctors vacation. Lol understand. i'm risk dying

\- Americans Thank goodness, mayors follow suit. beg. Fuck you. Yeah made decision months ago. exactly need focus anger game player. Gilead good harm around world I’ll wait people like get first round **to make sure health effects aren’t immediately negative.**

The vaccine trial volunteers already done you. Probably not, lot Pattent running soon, starting fall realize nurses taking probably doctors, outpatient non hospital setting right? may work post surgery slowed due Covid right? ER places hospital deal COVID near capacity. Labor Delivery nurses can’t work ER, ICU put people ventilators. 

Why think people lying “trying scare people” truth? Get denial gaslight can’t see truth? Free market working you?  Western Australia 0.971 highest Australia. Doubtful, mine convention center (but didn’t take TX) wall wall tables packed in. looked like bad CGI “meet Spartans” laptops. reply thinking wouldn’t read it? way indicates death toll would zeroed out. used miss Mitch Hedberg. we're lucky COVID-19 follows pattern coronaviruses (SARS MERS), cases deaths near zero 8 months start. Depending start USA, around October December. response virus, locking flatten curve, likely extended timeline.

SARS MERS disappeared suddenly, vaccine developed them, longer made sense deploy it. Let's hope true COVID-19. odd article headlined "" **Coronavirus’ spread GOP territory, explained 6 charts** "" seem even single chart. still differences. air pollution, people wear masks outdoor take indoor. outbreak, people take off. Thank fostering. worked group home CPS Ca, front end back end system GLAD people choose foster kids. know situation sucks, made impact kids lives none less. remember. wish best foster kids well you. Hopefully help children future, peace family. Let's keep mind hospitalized. quarantined home. WSB/Coronavirus special episode crossover event? Sounds like many cases.

Especially considering could even keep getting it.

Seems like need quiet plague rat. idea getting downvoted clearly right 1 dollar Bob Yep. good ol days white old bastards ran everything everyone else knew place /s Interesting say Moderna. kinds risks would new, never-before-tried RNA-vaccine pose vs. inactive/active-viral injection? example many topics really. Wow, people study everything! 8k dead unfortunately. 3rd worst country :( Yes this.

I'm Korea right using example people almost NEVER wear sunglasses, even sunny. Compare literally everyone pair sunglasses car bag back home. 

Not sure looking people eyes think also big thing able stare people behind glasses that's considered borderline illegal. 

Now, side, cars legally allowed tinted windows. even windshields. know places allow tinted front side windows cops look car identify driver. Korea. people opt 70% 90% tinting. got 60% dude like ""...wut?""

For me, can't see parking garage, happens every day. way dark. literally cannot see inside anyone's cars driving Seoul. that's like it. whole mask thing, really weird everyone started it. weirdo mask. putting others risk. stupid putting risk. “Without mask, droplets traveled 8 feet; bandana, traveled 3 feet, 7 inches; folded cotton handkerchief, traveled 1 foot, 3 inches; stitched quilted cotton mask, traveled 2.5 inches; cone-style mask, droplets traveled 8 inches.” Scientists suggest need least 70% infected recovered hit herd immunity. That’s 230 million people. 100k infections day, would still take 6 years get there.

We’ve got half country doesn’t want anything address disease killed 130k people, put many ER, caused many others suffer, causing unknown long-term damage bodies. Many genuinely believe it’s hoax. Others think it’s overblown. think can’t affect they’re young healthy. refusing wear mask, big parties shit, taking unnecessary risks spreading virus.

If leader made hard choices forced people things don’t want protection. guess asking leader lead bridge far days.

Our hope successful vaccine. seems Trump admin pinning hopes one. can’t help look countries see shitty US comparison. True, President Camacho lot fun asshole now.  Connecticut couldn’t used stop selling 8. 8:30 wanted beer drive Rhody make run packy Yeah, want continue almost cases.

I agree kids need go back school, need cautious smart it. state gonna least shut down? go?  “Hey step-virus, whatcha doing?” Im guessing people going Thailand get surgeries done fraction cost compared developed countries. eloquent summary I've wanted say lot people lately. According town cases.

But got infected bad use label drugs save life.

These plague rats getting control. think 9 months hospitals much better situation. feel deliver next 3 months. 

My wife delivered week ago, live South Florida. felt safe. EVERYONE required wear masks. entire floor dedicated infants. wife also tested giving birth. Temperature checks entering hospital. 

Overall, wife pleased well hospital able control environment. old St. Luke's Phoenix supposedly ready kick in. May getting contracts health workers bring online needed. Also air force base also contingency plus think others around state. Ok cool Thank explanation. don’t think vilifying others helps anyone, even if/especially apparently acting ridiculously. divides people uniting common enemy. Trying understand what’s going productive finding solution, least making situation bit better. 6%

But seriously, long term care facilities got hit hard we've adjusted. delayed reopening far longer others. serology results were/are lower places like CA another surge. Good thing protests cause spread! enforce stuff like masks, lockdowns, curfews, etc

How enforced? going enforce people charge enforcement, also told departments defunded? want police state?

Cake, eat it. Yes, people indoors, social distancing, wearing masks. 

BLM protestors outdoors mostly using masks. bother click links? obviously complete bullshit. lying teeth like this? find exciting gratifying something? And, even true, thought ""no cases"" hometown (according posts)...but it. Brilliant reasoning, sugar tits. It’s scary think much it’s spreading. I’m worker northeast. still aren’t anything person.

Correct. minuscule amount. Glad agree. die? people saying masks dont work trump administration sycophants.

And experts saying trump wrong making medical recommendations untested treatment, absolutely correct.

Sorry, think plague rat claiming community safe reopen trusted all. Especially plague rat got virus bad needed use label drugs save life.

Stop listening game show hosts science medical advice. embarrassing. Left almost. Big whup  Denmark mask- denier. Let sink in. That's much better picture different article probably right. still wrong assuming downplaying severity young people getting virus. comfort even NYC, site maybe worst outbreak Earth, never wound tapping surge capacity (got close though).  Wow, population numbers pretty old. California 39.5 million Texas 29 million. interesting studies going scientific medical community regarding genetic variations virus. Nothing peer-approved publishing, work ongoing.  Let's opposite everything US things great! 🙌 made point.

Meanwhile states similar amounts protests spike.

Plus spikes locations protest locations necessarily match.

For instance Washington State, protests, still protest going, Seattle Tacoma blue areas. started see increase cases, none blue areas they're red areas near Yakima Tri-Cities.

Statistics complicated.

Three states opened aggressively biggest spikes, regardless fairly trivial amount protests.

So protesting kind eliminated dominant variable economic reopening highly correlated dominant variable.

It's like data words count. Right! 


I never get answer guys. Like ""Reopen protests totes irresponsible gonna cause major spread?""

"" Fellow brothers sisters America, specifically CA, BRACE WINTER COMING. Stupidity cost we've billed. "" *que game thrones theme song*  They're formulating inhaled version take awhile. country, get $500 plus rent month unemployed. prove month trying enter job market. 

Even though I'm pretty good income group, live couple months decade ago TWICE (and back then, $350 plus rent), college later basically post-graduate education USA, jobless. That's learned dad. dad. thought felony places intentionally spread it?

nonetheless, hard prove unless paper trail. majority people could infected COVID-19 protests/looting young. 

So, exactly saying.  Nice! average American exactly flush cash point.. Wet markets literally farmers markets that’s sinophobia you. respectfully: ""shutdown"" longer realistic solution USA. guys blew chance 6 weeks ago now. 

You going get covid. fine, ill, die. ""economy"" thanks sacrifice..... tough one, feel students. I'd prefer find way get grads licensed versus finding ways get bars open... agree whiners there, that's really fair. lot people hurting far worse ways wanting wear masks.

People away loved ones. trapped abusive spouses parents. experiencing mental health crises. work. watching businesses fail. wondering they'll make rent mortgage payment. people live family friends, many basically living skeleton lives go work work home watch Netflix. course many also that, we're mess longer. 

Still, diminishing disproportionate burden bearing regards difficulty social distancing productive. outdoors. teen wants socialize friends too, he's dumb shit neither parents. viral mutation? sure rules but, yeah. Unless lungs magically heal, life now. true. Mock Deny blame admit wear mask go businesses like South Korea, Japan, Taiwan doing. Live returned normality countries. get $1,800 bill despite employer provided insurance amounted blood pressure check, ×-ray, told go somewhere else (that also help them) really seem like ringing endorsement Obamacare. Assuming even saved money first place ACA, point enough people stop putting shit instead settling ""it could've worse?"" 

Even ambulance chasing lawyers TV charge money unless actually help comes healthcare, spend significant amount yearly earnings shoulder shrug buck passing leaving better showed (and maybe even worse miss something life-threatening). car mechanic, tax preparer, barista Starbucks, number businesses services pulled shit, know pay stiffing you. comes healthcare though, swallow turd sandwich delightfully ask seconds, we'll pay fucking premium every country earth so. beginning pandemic, lag cases deaths 7 days, like clockwork. It’s 30+ deaths numbers still going substantially nationally, largely flat hot spots. 

Don’t get wrong I’m apprehensive possible spike week next. I’m starting get guardedly optimistic maybe won’t, least won’t nearly bad Northeast April. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Source? wonder they're reporting covid deaths pneumonia instead covid. pay patent runs someone else sells peanuts Yeah. feel main reason family kind breezed it. focused eating right exercise. It’s cheap eat right maybe that’s whole issue? can’t believe added obesity high risk category. We’ve known since shut down. Maybe vetting needed make official declaration? Turns evolution symbolic reasoning comes weird downsides. Yea really difficult factor amount data manipulation many governor states keep death tolls lower are. really basing current trends learned lesson massive backlash got pricing game changing Hep C drug high years ago lol. title belongs China. shitty country originate virus, working round two another swine flu.  scenario evolving pretty much around yourself. ever considered fact might get someone infected period? many, maybe even most, U.S. try hard part country C19 “least improved player” award, get it, really abysmal performance leadership. CA also higher population density. LA, OC, SF, SD, IE bigger population density highest Texas metro. Dallas Fort Worth metro.

It takes like 4 hours (I think) get one metro another Texas. takes like 1 hour Ca. Everything jam packed SoCal  1000 medical professionals said protesting important pandemic? brain hurts reading this. Damn, bad 1/4 way. 4 three. Public officials charge whether protests happen. Constitutionally, can't ban them. close beaches choose. 

Note never said closing beaches parks right wrong. fact, heavily implied close parks beaches charge. ""attacking people spreading virus going beach""? 

I literally bunch family members going beach weekend, I'm certainly attacking protests undoubtedly significant contribution current trend cases, even cases confirmed via testing data.

It sounds like going assumption virus spread easily protests, rather raw data. Data suggesting protests really huge source spread (which we've gotten) would surprising; already knew virus spread easily outdoors. scientist says something mean true. science peer-to-peer system scientists test validity science says, considered scientific. YouTube similar system Okay, hopefully stay are, travel around cared, situation right now. Yeah, Trump admin squandered 2 whole months pretending virus non issue ramped up. could stepped up, bought surplus PPE, turn could enabled CDC Fauci direct general public wear face coverings. could mobilized contact tracing testing... didn't. president still wear god damn mask front camera. home. pay 9 years fda approval. 100s thousands tests debt repayment repay investors. an. ay drugs failed. anti science disregard facts even wrong ones. anti science get things wrong correct yourself. definition scientific experimentation Stop lip service take actions, small big enough minority wear mask outside. Short arresting maybe paying them, get comply. Police also want deal especially black live matter movement defund police. Exactly. business reopens, work.. “I definitely don’t regret getting COVID, right thing right cause,” said Turner.

Yeah didn’t need imbecile protesting According friend Google, double checked actually Texas that's bigger:

""Texas is 1.7 times bigger than California.

California is approximately 403,882 sq km, while Texas is approximately 678,052 sq km, making Texas 68% larger California. Meanwhile, population of California is ~37.3 million people (12.1 million fewer people live in Texas)."" keep borders closed, end Alaska loophole, stop fucking flights happening, try best overcome inevitable economic woes America thrown terrible depression we'll least get terrible recession run mill depression. Korean doctor oversaw SARS containment South Korea predicts next pandemic mosquito related. Cool! 3 open ICU beds entire county! 27.  


So 18 days increases enough time big uptick deaths - tho flat decreasing recently. Trump failed businessman. 
That pretty well understood. 
Why people surprised fucked health response also economic response well? Man south 90% don’t wear masks. Fucking idiots neighbor died it, nearly took wife too. worries they're parents age parents way conditions going on. folks side country growing there. two quarantined. I’m freaked needles stuff like getting something stuck pretty deep nose uncomfortable. painful though. , going make view ""it's flu bro"" even stronger.

Like Tom Rice. caught it, refused back down. said mask would've made even worse would've built CO2 something. give half people false sense security, fail ill, give fire anti vax crowd? interpreting 50% actually means know, ever see someone argue ""constitutional right wear mask"".. wonder, people walk around city live fully nude, get mad either get arrested kicked ever business trying enter?

Where constitution say clothed public? Point being, students telling us mental health suffering home, do? ignore think issues real? could look deaths heart failure well (around 650k) something could largely mitigated lifestyle change well, similarly largely mitigate covid. Many people US deemed neither important mitigate though, sucks, dont disagree there, dont disagree OPs point fundamentally either felt gave fairly good answer. time face facts folks. We're gonna die 2022. Try run it, try hide it, whatever do, truth. Accept there's still time make peace wonder much people projecting insecurity decisions. I’m psychologist - know always feel slightly guilty eat meat around vegan friends. preparticipation physical examination (PPE) Yeah I've saying since April, there's basically way contain even get back South Korea situation. find level open allows us function without spreading virus exponentially need stick level. It'll still year virus runs course. lot people get sick quarantine months.

Basically, economy stink year. Keep mind graph testing slowed... God knows real line would look like. Ahh know that. Remember first started, market went like 20%? it’s worst it’s ever market nearly gained everything back. People stupid. told colleague ""constitutional right"" wear mask outside work.

That's fucking dumb. right would concert all. We're goddamn pandemic. people really go without ""live"" music months? doses buying 3 months doses treatment 1 person

Seems like manufacturing rate treatment drop bucket compared number cases.  3 months factory output treat less 100,000 patients. US 2.5 million infected last 4 months. Despite people including thread argue permanent since got new lungs sure.

Amanda Kloot’s husband permanent damage amputation likely severe lung damage descriptions (and knows neurological issues length time vent). no, people still argue need “proof” permanent damage won’t happy someone comes back time machine it. EU rules based residency citizenship. us never got stay safe home. “U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall said supports local communities making decisions masks.

“I shudder thought state government tell use wear,” said.”

...has heard pants? “no shoes shirt service”? literally workplace (manufactured housing builder). also people laughing non stop harassing wearing one mandatory. 

We guy refused wear mask told wear go home... went home. probation absenteeism already. decent paying job piece fabric. 

I wear mask (homemade, well fitting, breathable, fogging safety glasses) protect myself, spouse heart issues diabetes. 

I can't fathom carrier disease could kill him, parents, parents, ANYONE. 

SERIOUSLY WEAR DAMN MASK!! Texas whole nother level MURICA Couple issues here. saying education system needs fix, you. teaching 14+ years, high school educator 10 years jumped college level.

What need become science teacher? Take 1-day worth tests called CSET California (not sure states). became health teacher health background (formally). Luckily I'm avid fan things medicine studied butt off. Literally though formal health background. Went get MPH PhD since believed heavily knowledge. Taught teachers varied amazingly intelligent sharp marbles. 

MY POINT - many idiots pass 1-day test, join credentialing program, magically teaching without solid foundation? LOTS!

So many teachers get pissed this: ""Those can, do. can't, teach."" ways, see truth this. work (science, math, writing, etc.) far tedious developing lesson plan based someone else's work. I've sides. TEACHING STUDENTS, however, tedious.

Long story short- experience idiot today: 
 spent hours trying convince person science could find including pretty great meta-analysis published response: ""WHO corrupt org funded it."" person heavily believes Essential Oils. science could spout debunked pics YouTube clips.

We're walls stupidity. provide data, squat hold wall. There's way packing hundreds students classrooms lecture halls indoors students socializing usual top result fewer infections. corporate spin best.

That's plan. They're going smaller class sizes rooms students properly Many students town would stay home (at parents' house elearning) on-campus courses moved online.

That's told university. Read article. Cirque acquired Blue Man Group 2017 Brazil, Russia, US, UK, India. Although India impose lockdown Yeah total death higher total cases. Mask get locked home learn better. important me! Newfoundland Labrador, Canada able basically almost month ago. Several provinces introduced similar things way let ppl interact limited amount ppl. believe team mathematical modelling increased contacts. G4 EA H1N1. It’s like viruses running available usernames think (were) owned CdS. want Americans act, cant say small number, matter represents. 1/3 pounder burger flopped Americans thought smaller 1/4 pounder since 3 &lt; 4.

You need tell largest representation. 5% means $3 billion, say $3,000,000,000,000.00 No, probably disappointing almost 8k now... Link actual always skeptical science press release. Peer-reviewed papers please. Jfc Worst? think mean BEST case scenario! nailed it. People hard time saying ""it is"" 

I know why, want able criticize right wing people wearing masks following social distancing thinking called Ever listened Corb Lund? He's fantastic, fun storytelling songs. Real swell guy good live show. Wear goddamn mask stop bunch man childs. Lives stake. wearing mask public potentially killing people. let's fight elders dead. WEAR MASK! Shaming work maybe need step up. Remember stores cannot tell customer wear one even state mandate. speak up, shy please ask people around speak you. anti mask shit needs end NOW!! I'm saying violence even option I'm saying shame right store. Walk diagonally follow directly behind. Next time see I'm speaking up. Luckily area work I've seen people. man, wife 5 year old kid target? Please. types people ignorant makes sick. Yeah, really underlines thickness ""hate"" feeling followers. even joke contexts? joke per se, simply Pavlovian bell. rings bells emotional reward reaction.  COVID like flu then? thought weren’t supposed compare flu ive watching. testing enough get much attention, sadly. expect made elsewhere less.

Nah stuff specialized hard manufacture. rest world probably get penny tablet generic.

Or buy superior public health efforts. 60+ years random controlled trials (RCT's) say cloth masks, surgical masks, even n95 respirators stop spread influenza airborne respiratory illnesses. 

 

You read article look studies yourself, listen Fauci, CDC, WHO, surgeon general, others saying thing 3 months ago changed story people started buying toilet paper hand sanitizer afraid people would also buy PPE meant hospitals. powers decided tell us make masks buy surgical n95 masks LARP around like ignorant sheep. Thanks reminding this. wrote college Public Health classes. precedent claim state can't shit. Well yes fucking anti-science yokels. Florida.

Here's we're told:

All hospitals receiving pre-pandemic orders. distributor able provide additional PPE surge capacity international demand high increasing. PPE originates countries manufacturers international community also ordering.

So capacity added absorbed global demand increases.

The lockdown really helpful eventually able save excess PPE longer exponential growth.

We're talking potentially ration PPE August. 100% agree. number people large enough law large numbers apply, pretty sure practice percentages pretty closely follow math. probability, order every single person, without exception, certainty know someone infected, ~100% people contract it, otherwise always potential outliers like said. like said pretty strong majority would know someone 10M cases math right poor PPE causing high blood pressure?? I’m sure poor equipment blood pressure. Why? discussed context history aspect wet markets Lol guy thinks everyone drinks like irish Yep. smart conscientious people staying in. in-person diners concentrated asshole. based residency, citizenship  OK Fox news Brazil, Russia, US, Mexico... else? maybe speaking dollars, trumps native (and basically language) help understand importance wearing masks. House cards good way put it. I'm fretting much travelers current hotspots bringing infections undoing progress. think Massholes continue vigilant masking social distancing, keep things control even out-of-staters bring virus. I'm worried soon we'll get impatient careless like what's happened elsewhere nation. 

Also colleges open August see way we'll escape outbreaks then. want trust Massholes continue smart civic-minded battle wears on, feels precarious. Ugh worry much. brother premier Ontario right Lol city livestream protests saw completely maskless others masks pulled masks used properly. argued reddit ""EVERYONE wearing masks oMG!1111"" dont even know think anymore yeah think get nuance. America 330 million people. 

About half sane, rational - believe evidence science.

There swayable 20% bright go flow.

That lot 'normal' people, however..........

40% batshit crazy - say 'white' say 'black' principal. Great, figure maybe ponder may respond G4 EA H1N1. I’m board this. It’ll tricky snowbirds start drive back CT plates. Well, also shitton cases so... desensitized. even 'not real comes them'.  people literally give fuck. often even believe real kills people around them. Americans profoundly fucking stupid.  is. Pure fucking stupid. Yeah. It’s bad. New Zealand, Germany China also sits Kazakhstan. Finland, Hong Kong, South Korea sits Sweden. Yay Kazakhstan! Charlie Baker done great job whole situation great see this. mean never gave up, went washing hands constantly leaving apartment groceries seeing girlfriend week occasional outdoor picnic beach day trip friends.

I mean want contain this, sort hard justify completely locking inside basically ruining mental health relationship governors opening bars, tens thousands marching streets, one done anything make COVID situation better. Ask around see many people know lost someone. Hell, even ask know someone lost someone. try 3 degrees separation. stats jibe reality. media friend.

Watch says. man 70+ years old. Obese. Eats burgers soda every day, I'm told. also POTUS, access highest level intelligence alphabet soup agencies provide yet genuinely seems unfazed willing share air entire arenas full people. 

Say want man, actions consistent words vis vis plandemic. exactly. Administration ran things divide us best bet.  I’m sure calling public opinion based scientific study. 

Either way, you’re right side issue. Stay safe friend :) That's going take really long time vast overwhelming majority people get COVID die. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* think Telegraph article wrong

Sensationalized. say ""research suggests it"", link study, idea research looking at. seen many newspaper articles this, essentially anecdotal hospital workers. seen real science outside small (essentially anecdotal) studies hospital patients. extremely worrisome, since information single important thing would need know judge actions next months, nobody seems interested South Korea proved work winter.

However, less contagious Wuhan strain (admittedly science really proven difference, seems overwhelmingly likely). They've harder time eliminating recent outbreak Bergamo strain (though act immediately now) Daegu R value increasing seasons people inside 

Bizarrely, flu deaths [peak Florida Arizona US. seen good science explaining this. might simple schools winter, UV light Iceland 

I speculate we'll see scenario travel uncontained countries allowed, ""quarantine countries"" like Iceland play role intermediary. would fly remain Iceland could guarantee next country Norway HUGE border Sweden

Norway continuing far right militarizing border seems like possible think we're finding virus easy contain via TTI

Absolutely. TTI stand for, btw? Never heard acronym before. non-profit mean anything here. make money go business. head school charge that. Alright, fair enough, respect honesty.

Although different opinions, hope upset you, bad immune system sorry that, wish happy healthy life. relief indoor dining seem big impact like areas. really seem bars biggest culprit spreading. believe bars next phase? interesting see plays out. Yup, span 3 months, rather what, 8 years something? This! read recent 1-star reviews see places complaints mask policy. Good, cases trending downward it’s possible contain borders remain shut tight. hear? According news, protestors immune virus. “everything thought knew” articles...that’s fault science. IMO that’s fault science education journalism. 

I think people often aren’t educated understand science isn’t textbook immutable facts, dynamic system trying uncover truths world. Science modifies dogmas based new data - that’s good thing. people inherently hate “knowing” something revise it. It’s flaw human brain case. 

As journalism, feel like competition likes views clicks grows hand journalism gets. GOOD science writing would include appropriate context caveats, hype sensationalism. imagine journalists start integrity gradually realize tempered balanced headlines don’t get clicks hurt career start sensationalize. 

Again, along hating revise beliefs, flaw human brain favor juicy drama cold, hard facts. don’t come beliefs based facts, rather drawn drama fearmongering ragemongering. 

Anyway, it’s science’s fault. It’s fact science odds ways brains work. CDC sidelined political appointees meddling message. stuff going break, though. Weights, metal, never go bad, ever clean inside hole. Safety rack? going hit rails much unless consistently fail workouts, even do, DIY safety rack gets job done. I'd willing bet could drop 1000 pounds safety rack's safety rails several times damage it. Weight bench? That's gonna break either.

There moving parts. buying used car. equipment suddenly going break you. replace anything all, going nuts bolts. 

I'm salesman, though. I've done enough here. Lol try tout MA's supposed higher standing? say state better history subjective. Press **X** Doubt. think they're dicks. can't wrap head around anyone actually believing sort conspiracy. Well, lets hope pans out.

It certainly hurt feelings does. Yep, certainly stable nearly society thousands years public houses certainly serve crucial societal function definitely largely independent businesses best survive difficult time. You’re wrong. It’s aren’t paying attention. actively seeing what’s happening willfully ignoring it. can’t HANDLE IT. want things go back can’t process world post pandemic. They’re fragile weak. Callous negligent. Remember stories people jumped windows stock market crashed? killed MATERIAL POSSESSIONS. killed selves didn’t want live world didn’t ECONOMIC WEALTH. again. people aren’t cut successful. Success means trial error. lose win some. It’s personal integrity determination. People focused much outside things enough inside things. That’s even correct okay... people still saying that? now? [how low Hey fellow GP-er! personal saddest loss Royal, know go wings anymore bummer. everyone gets sick, could generate tens billions sales. can’t imagine government officials would unethical. reading chart correctly Arizona went 31 37 10 day window 6/23-Now. seem drastically sharp no.

Look saying Arizona get shit together, lets call NYC yet.

NYC always worst location epidemic US. Right, intervention. 

Once intervention takes place, three week lag cases stop increasing, pace. Take NY example. shutdown March 20th NY positive cases peaked April 8th. think first week March 20th - 27th still full speed ahead. 

TL;DR would expect intervention take week start affecting new cases numbers, 10-14 days numbers hit daily peak (as increases wane). garbage way announced worded temporary. 

Even INCLUDING extra $600/week pandemic-relief CARES act, still caps people in, say, Florida $11,100 entire year.

And that's getting MAXIMUM FL benefit every single week CARES act bonus. neither one lasts long. Well, getting one helluva Darwin participation award. tired spread idiocy happy let burn.  gyms staying open planning sue. Good! Almost one wearing masks throughout whole thing, least Zurich area. Joe Rogan guy start pandemic. Joe downplaying covid chance gets. It’s disheartening lose respect many things/people looked virus hit. Oh look I’m oppressed opening minded someone claims seek truth. give damns youtube links. Show paper. truckloads papers saying aint so. official IFR estimates every cdc around globe stating otherwise original post dutch conspiracy website anti-lockdown protesters. release already, im sure releasing early less harmful what's going right now. Mike Pence smiles asks aide hear Jesus talking, too. God people pathetic sometimes. goes show helm made pretty big difference connecting correct pieces make successful companies. happen automatically. I'm getting $1,139/week Oklahoma pre-tax. really hope brings change areas, too. Like virtual meetings appts classes (that don’t cost ridiculous amount more) still available disabled. People wearing masks go cold sickness. Proper hand washing hygiene. Empathy us socially distance far started. Awareness immune compromised. Keeping sense community built many us shared experience. many good lessons could learned chaos. Yes can't wrap head around way thinking. people say old people die (which true) lives meaningless. I'd DEVASTATED anything happened grandparents. read today government planning keeping US border closed 2021. know last time happened was. sometimes still feel like I'm living movie. Can't believe we're living thru pandemic magnitude. Happy 4th July stay safe! She’s pretty well. move uncle accident. 80 year old lady, huge loss her. ever actually watched interview Elon Musk? rich man bad? luck. also seen state legislators rambling ""those darn kids taking seriously"" friends mask dive back hellscape else homeless. I've already hospital summer apparently immunity fleeting might screwed again. 

People age demographic PTO, savings, job security ride like boomers. folks department retired soon saw high risk leaving rest us full time pick work hiring freeze. It’s service jobs. analyst LA company ton people field getting laid salaries cut, too, simply just...less analyze. people aren’t buying products services, affects everyone person making minimum wage ringing purchase way operations, design, analysis, HR, finance teams. I'll touch weiner wonder much crowds came PA &amp; part little spike recent days (7d avg high 300s last week trending downwards, 550s flat week). could re-openings. lot states set rate less making before, lot half making before

ALL that. pandemic-relief CARES act. depends quite bit state live too

Ain't truth. Florida caps people $3,300 year, that's MAXIMUM, even average. smart, is.. meant like might bought blue recently.

(FYI Fauci lawmaker) Ridiculous, patent-holder can't supply potentially life-saving drug pandemic forced release patent free use time meet demand. cousin dropped high school tells I'm sheep falling obvious lies random acquaintance says someone know died car wreck death certificate listed covid cause. That's somewhat true NY NJ Washington Oregon never got overwhelmed, think total death count states combined less 2k. PNW caught outbreak early prevented much worse outcome. Oh fuck  Thats experience Malmö. dont wear mask see do. one bothering far seen. Well, might seem stupid much different pub club. opened month now, events 1000 people allowed. people bridge distanced would club pub. uptick new cases one small region due coal mine workers. rest country uptick despite reopening happened 6 weeks ago. think deaths 10x higher reported? hope that’s sarcasm buddies cheer cause bucket factory. Antibody tests blood tests.  Big difference basically hoarding buying enough. thing happened 80s seat belts. Amen that! Hidden deaths raise mortality rate. Hidden cases lower mortality rate. whether one outweighs other, given studies put IFR 1% 10% closed cases USA died, number hidden cases massively outweighs number hidden deaths will, better try slow spread say pointless. We're bad way AZ, something drastic needs change. Yet cities largest protests seen spikes Could def part it. think issue disease consistently contagious. seems spread super spreaders much flu. result it’s super vulnerable stay home mask usage. Problem gets enough people rules relaxed enough, super spreaders plentiful enough sky rockets. think that’s see huge range reported r0, anywhere 2-5 various points. die end. depends exact numbers involved. deaths new covid cases counted *and* new deaths, think still makes mortality rate go slightly. deaths, however many deaths covid, that's 100% mortality rate particular group cases. Traveling general going safe. personally would risk anyone family, definitely children. Well know, fact multiple studies back up, complete game changer. skeptics hate fauci think he's liar whole mask issue months ago. people ones spreading think either fake, think flu care. live North Texas quite scared now. already restricting going grocery runs. suppose try survive delivery (we clean everything delivered us).

It whether family get sick. point get sick, may able get help hospitals running beds.

I suppose blaming reckoning next election comes. right now, care fixing problem. Whatever Greg Abbot done .. whatever said .. future day revisit ... now, please get something done. Start building field hospital. Roll back opening.

And still want go bars .... guys hold weeks? essentially need drink crowded place, strangers breathing face. Omg he's Mandarin “Dr McCann points Covid-19 pandemic, believed started animals.”

Did read ? agree, far lock downs concerned. opinion, think mask wearing capacity limits used compromise. 

Businesses like Apple already closed stores FL TX spread control. looks like increases cases effect economy, regardless death toll may be. Non-woven fabric. Great middle layer. Cheap, too; 2 euro/m², whereas cotton fabric like 5-15 euro/m². I've made facemasks two layers cute cotton fabric (washable 60C) square non woven fabric middle layer / filter. make great hygienic facemasks.

I still use N95 subway such, I'm going take walk outside, homemade facemasks breathable, fit much better, still keep others safe. I'm guessing close E-coli Salmonella. think might hit 50k today worldometers. Sitting 39.1k, Texas ~5k left report California still least 5k report. trickle down? lol baby step right direction..

We need bigger steps mind you. better butt fucking nothing. scale human suffering would create would unprecedented modern developed world.

Alright, reasoning have, one - common one - really logical. We've gone recessions before, we've survived fewer deaths occur virus. Far fewer. fact, death rate largely unaffected. would wager dying worse fate hardship.

We forget WW2 completely shut US economy almost half decade, 10 years Great Depression. survived that. Hell, WW2 over, despite economy grinding halt long, US still managed climb obscurity world's foremost superpower.

This comes ""the economy matters people, not-factually-supported reasons I've developed support this."" read article? Oh my... sorry. It’s real real tough Fox Addict (or Fox Brain like) family members. struggle too... I’ve cut members family similar reasons, none close parents siblings. feel though... 

hopefully we’ll survive Trumpacolypse, die Covid process, reason come friends families’ minds laugh period time year now. Hang buddy, this. mothball dorms, furlough non-tenured professors. Upkeep relatively inexpensive compared endowment. fundraising to. 

The local businesses, OTOH, probably anywhere near deep pockets. work mask. Probably one gym too, never know. diabetes really risk putting fam danger.

I cardio gym though, running mask would quite task. lifting one. makes literally sense all. NYC massive protests month ago cases still going down.

Use head even hurts. actually agree wrote except athletes schools part.

Here's reality. America like countries. built trusting gvt stand agree them, good bad. never gonna get national compliance America.

We either achieve herd immunity, get vaccine virus goes away own. mini shutdowns, 25% capacity restaurants, temp beach shutdowns...they're for.political points. bullshit. Even NYC currently well, gonna go right back increased rates open back up. mean think people would go bars next week gonna responsible they're closed. I'm sick people pretending like actual solution feel like middle ground. Like, things aren’t dire people thinking back March. positive news terms vaccine development lower expected death toll. However, it’s also fair say US especially piss poor job containing spread, nowhere NEAR woods, things much worse be. absolutely single mention COVID article. Come on. Fine asses hard. Seriously, fuck selfish prick refuses cooperate contact tracers right now

Masks one major piece public health policy allows somewhat normal life come back, cure treatment found, without causing untenable spike infections. wearing mask, directly contributing increased likelyhood hard state- even nation-wide lockdown orders end handed again. So, even completely egocentric jerk, wearing mask objectively correct choice make. stupidity rampant across generations RemindMe! August 5th plenty people dying know isn’t hoax. say yes, denied coverage insurances certainly fired jobs. whole experience made much pessimistic large scale human problems like globl warming. cannot unite virus, hope have? hate people Same.

Many students already put significant investment time money get are, puts difficult position upcoming school year live like 40 minutes outside Pittsburgh smaller town almost nobody wears masks. seriously scares Bars also people worst judgment congregate, bar crowds aren’t exactly people moving society forward Sorry found studies make correlation ""respect"" ""the immune system"". people get virus homes.

Hopefully works better. defund shit company. Glad see this! worry 70+ year old mom PA working tourist shop, customers wear masks.

From completely different set data (total death counts) reply comes similar conclusion.  People stupid selfish. Unfortunately, think Michigan going revert back. think? Shhh. making sense using logic. Apparently unwelcome days.

These fools blaming protests peaked month ago versus bars restaurants still packed am. vaccine development years, tweaked final stages testing.  misread Gov. Teen Wolf got pretty excited. That’s absolutely true. It’s hotly debated topic, many countries, Uber drivers contractors, employees, thus don’t get access things like medical insurance. 


http://kluwertaxblog.com/2020/04/03/uber-drivers-employees-or-independent-contractors/?doing_wp_cron=1593330865.1627910137176513671875 Eh.. bs restrictions. counties businesses. 

Still pretty weak decision, imo Visiting bit. one fucking wears mask Remindme! 3 weeks Here’s [thread Texas Coronavirus sub discussing potential reporting. Cornell University $7.3 Billion endowment. go bankrupt.

OTOH, Ithaca small town, lot small businesses depend students. student's come back fall, lot could go droves. local economy could crater. Good, I'm glad doesnt mess around. 

ITS HARD WEAR DAMN MASK.  cases, someone isn’t alive likely dead. !remindme 2 months supposed eat mask though lol..? know, masks kinda useless stores wont get covid simply passing near someone... completely agree, mean Trump made masks (the “the greatest weapon invisible enemy”) political issue... I’d think rule would changed enforced given current circumstances. CFS hahahaha

Not people exposed virus get infected. age range, small fraction testing positive need hospitalization. small fraction end ICU. fraction end permanent damage.

I going lose sleep minuscule chance possibly ending long term damage. want it, guest. free country all. force others choice. don’t dog fight all, someone outside dedicated doctor even opportunity contract MERS twice extremely unlikely. 

It’s far deadly, rare, currently doesn’t transmit person person well. sure national data Minnesota it’s [clearly young Dude, Germany partly even travel federal states Germany.
If federal state part high infection rates people banned traveling parts again.

Also, never heard someone calling virus ""American virus"" did. think Trump first one assign virus nation. Right? work electronic development, could design tool receive tens thousands needles next months. course, factories FDA certified, know experience slows adds ton hurdles mean, whole point cotton mask better nothing? Like average person working hospital? 15 min test accurate. live Chicago say seeing protests close line wasn’t spread people masked absolute bullshit. *most* 2 every five people saw mask on. risk college aged students, particular, nonexistent. vast majority polled students want go back campus.

And please spare “new normal” nonsense. It’s creepy dystopian. IFR .26-.5% overwhelming number asymptomatic cases. isn’t Black Plague. think they're randomly testing everyone. They're testing symptoms known contacts request tests. I'm sure thing spreading young people went bar-hopping, that's best group get infected. plan get 60% herd immunity want spread healthy under-30 crowd, serious complications almost unheard of. That’s right call Unfortunately, virus lethal enough that, contagious it'll catch lot innocents crossfire. Even full PPE doctors catch (in places hamstring actually provided needed). hotel, staycation? vacation? thought staycations thing Great Recession feel better saving hotel costs stay home explore city. continue along trend American exceptionalism demands it. long people give shit going beaches bars health neighbors.

 countries faring much better simply wearing masks contact tracing empathy neighbors. America, can't get bunch idiots socially distance, wear masks, talk contact tracers inevitably get sick. 

Why school pro sports? would take highly paid professionals risk lives even let unskilled professionals get drunk bar? clue they'd open schools.  

At point, would shocked slightest second stimmy comes time buy votes. 

And dude. even seen second wave yet. never got first one. buckle America dividing like enemies want can't get page masks 128,000 neighbors died. Whether upvote downvote statistical fact Texas lying Covid19 death rate. [We even know actual Texas lying report Covid19 statistics. states downplaying fatality rate, Texas hugely egregious way. actual death toll likely _at least_ double reporting. policy least month more. extending indefinitely. AstraZeneca, production company, planning whip billion they’re already production. vaccine works enough June. least area, rides absolutely nonstop anyways though, never seen like this.

I think part might there's drivers road right now. last weekend find ride near several minutes waiting, either Uber Lyft. ...you either surivor die...no shit 😂 thank headlining obvious. please do, going claim $11,000/year lot money int US. Domestic terrorism. far today I’ve seen rallying multiple year lock chastising others using public bathroom. please stop pretending sub caters rational audience? agree, but, who's going enforce it?

Employees try enforce get abused, threatened, put tantrums adult toddlers day long. Nobody getting paid enough that. Places shutting back customers refuse wear masks lose shit told to.

Get police it? Somehow seems pretty bad idea, too. Students Ithaca, town Cornell is, go bars restaurants downtown thousands.

Being college parties sharing everything huge risk. need infected locals feom Ithaca frat party goes several hundred person outbreak accross campus.

Happened school March, I’m much smaller town upstate NY. girl brought Westchester 400 cases 1 week partying. count wedding consummate marriage? Fair point. live Sacramento. Yolo, Sutter, Yuba, Placer, El Dorado counties aren’t subject increased restrictions reached relative ease. expect influx asshats weekend, courtesy Sacramento. Weird...it’s almost like someone said people, slow testing! 

100% they’re doing, keep charade forever? Kinda doubt it. money week make things look better 4th July weekend testing start rise back up.

Just gut feeling though. experience it’s older ones don’t give shit know! I'm filled mix rage terror every time see group people masks walk store. We're top 3rd inning, that... Half-way point would finding effective vaccine, back half actually getting people, based everything else that's happened past \~4 months, huge mess. I’m going build operate flying machine plans saw online don’t trust planes pilots crashes.

Never mind zero mechanical understanding spatial awareness, I’m going it. developed, one point. think we're regressing. fact, know we're regressing. Changes everything, suspect know want troll.

Saying COVID isn’t bad fictional disease 100% fatality rate isn’t objectionable statement. way diminish horror COVID-19. You’re looking troll. that’s want spent time, power ya kid. Unless plan walling entire town testing every resident, really see workable. can't mandate students stay dorm rooms whenever they're class. People going go restaurants, bars, gyms they're open. 

And every student lives campus either. colleges enough dorms house every student, especially grad students. US death rate declining since April 18th... 2 weeks? That's definitely factor imo. That's meat processing plants get bad. People working close together refrigerator $600 roughly $15 per hour, thats top basic unemployment making $20 per hour. Much median states. two dose vaccine? 300 million doses mean 150 mil get vaccinated? employer fired lockdown, resulting $0.00 guy. That's plain BS. China high demand meat, buy world. world, working conditions industrialized meat plants crap. 

But local businessmen farmers profit china's demand.

In german meat plant ""Tönnies"" Gütersloh/Rheda Wiedenbrück COVID-19 cases soar sky high - sout east european workers plants forced tiny appartments, sharing 4 rooms 12 people, getting minimum wage (9.50€/h) - pay 30€/day accomodation.

They treated like crap - shows broad population fraction people getting covid-19, last outbreak meat plant showed 2000 7000 employees positive. Meat workers treated like 3rd class people germany working effectively less half minimum wage. Governor shut bars (any establishment receives 51% sales alcohol), restaurants 50% capacity dining inside still allowed, Harris county mandated businesses must require customers wear masks. mask order went effect week ago place least end August. Okay forget 7 day thing. 21 day lag would also shown now.

EDIT: mean references 7-day moving average, note numbers smooth reporting irregularities (numbers tend come little lower Sunday Monday, higher Tuesday Wednesday, weekend). i’ve heard vaccine existence modification, they’re running lot human trials, line asap.

If recall, Oxford one originally designed generic coronavirus vaccine, one specific SARS-CoV-2, already ahead. Elon Musk Donald Trump tech. slaps brand name shit people done press tour make people think he's baller I'm sure he's thought through, what's stop someone driving 20 minutes Ventura/Orange/SanBernardino/Riverside? LA huge sprawl, there's distinct divide counties. .....deaths lag 2-4 weeks behind new surge cases, that's appears like walk anywhere 5-10 miles paved trail day get outside, get fresh air, get sunshine. see maybe 10 people days. Wearing mask covers half face.

Why would wear mask?

Dont get wrong, 100% support masks makes sense/inside/nearby people. blanket ""you shall wear mask outside"" dumb fuck. even talking about? Right? would’ve never thought going store could fuck nerves seeing people w/o masks. virus already control lockdowns worked. don’t understand mentality around must forever remain locked like 2021 2022. asking isn’t going happen. told point lockdown help get spread virus control could open back after. virus seems control places, they’re going start opening things up. Probably.

Honestly, Trump made mask one slogans it, they'd sell heartbeat would nonissue. or, know, dont illegally enter country pandemic.

not fucking rocket science. keep bringing 7 days number, basis anything. all.  Elon Musk terrorist. lead resistance future army cybernetic beings. Join Musk-sistance! #musksistance 2016 election would like word. would say views far left right, honestly hate hypocrisy self righteous left even right. Everything ""you wrong right"" time either sides wrong closer middle report asymptomatic people lung dommage last days. think he's easing state something strict, albeit slowly. imagine he's going lot internal conflict considering half state deniers police/sheriff enforce anything matter policies place... incentive lockdown imo. know counties state doing, good portion follow policy LA county. hardly April anyways. Must adult kissing party. Confirmed positives important, number people slight suntan important. Like sun damage, number people hospitalized die *is* important.

Daily hospitalizations higher 20 people, maybe? deaths appears holding flat, less. 

A small uptick numbers matter expected, no? Personally think self discipline.

Look person like David Goggins, excuses. wondering, I’m sure it’s ok post here, politics rule? pandemic highly politicized many countries, matter what, comes around that. Every week hear something COVID that’s directly linked political stunt, issue, politician, etc. get want stick news facts studies, rule starting make sense given current circumstance. Maybe it’s me. Snickers for? I'm Washington county shock people actually pretty good around here. I'd say 95% wear masks wear correctly. worth, I'm Gen X think millennials seem like solid generation. better, less apathetic version ours, really. music output kind sucks comparison though. Wyoming? Why? People spread compared places like NYC they’re basically already social distancing. Apparently small minority chicanos call ""latinx"", term used bourgie circles much anywhere else France, precise, Paris, drivers masks ... new deal : cancel uber driver want put mask. course reclaim Uber, works 100% well : joke that. 


In France, general, people use mask, gigs begin ... I'm like crazy seems I'm one froggies read reddit see news around world coronavirus ... i'm dispair. Yip, saw that. He's planning trying win voters. He's gonna cheat. frankly whether wins loses he'll living life luxury. I'm employed Virginia recovering well.

My brother got furloughed extended. really needs extension. really said “we believe freedumbs”. Important distinction. don’t know protests NYC DC city governments literally told healthcare workers cannot ask COVID patients went protests. need lockdown vaccine developed, PERIOD. excuses. ‘Conspiracy nut trusts own, personal anecdotal experience says...’ need nap time juice boxes else get cranky. Let say heartfelt hope much needed appreciated. work Northern Ute tribe extremely difficult them. Much money comes oil located reservation taken big blow since COVID. mention lack visitors coming reservation severely impacts economy largely held sales non-native people. 

Furthermore, Norther Ute (and suspect many tribes) insanely high rates diabetes. 70% ouintah-Ouray reservation. That's insane likely puts people even risk COVID. respect Navajo can't easy choice. Yet open casino (Harrah's) Philly lived Abilene majority life. I’m fearing friends there. hope gets cancelled, I’d hate see aftermath. theory warmer gets people likely stay indoors air conditioning recirculating air. Makes sense hot southern states experiencing surges right now. ignorant! Latinx race. Caucasian, Black, Asian Indigenous hispanics. Pure ignorance. I’m Oregon feeling effects this. City didn’t reopen, tourist towns did. cases surging basically one hospital entire county. Paging Dr. Gains - wearing today? Hopefully yes. Sad part group people complaining heavily things can't list mod said political guess new surges take months develop simply 2-3 week process like originally believed?


It's two three weeks mitigation. Depending lot different factors:

* People staying home
* People going out
* Social distancing 
* Masks 
* Work home
* etc etc etc


The mitigation protocols put place longer takes virus spread.  USA loves breaking records year's Covid Olympics. ...do know many people live USA? nothing wrong going park lake often public restrooms. Outdoor transmission rare places like it’s easy stay 10-20 feet apart people. Promoting idea never leave house makes people want give go back normal instead smart safe activities “inspector” rank FBI. wanna fake it, least research And? Martin Tripp one got bunch publicity, he's exactly person Musk crushed excessive force something say Tesla could hurt it.

And clear, Musk tried MURDER Martin Tripp. mention Ford exactly nice guy, violent anti union policies commonplace early 20th century. Musk hand pretty unique still 21st century. safety record absolutely means:

* professors in-person office hours, 
* admins workers behind glass overlap.

They still live home people, get within 6' student (unless medically necessary). Point wouldnt get point death number high Pittsburgh- unintelligible second person plural pronouns Lack public restrooms don’t stop people crowding Times Square NYE watch ball drop. Life would lot better people acted rational though agree... elephant room ---

Elon Musk feud Jeff Bezos weeks, advocating Amazon broken monopoly-busting Bezos ALSO owns Washington Post, publication set aside critical frontpage space write total five Tesla - Fremont employees fired twice within two weeks; overtly implying former article terminations targeted actions COVID-19 safety whistleblowers casually glance one two employees offered job back able contacted Tesla HR lockdown.

Again, I'm implying Jeff Bezos, CEO multiple corporations, personally hand petty hit-pieces...

...But surprise journalists WaPo wanted make good impression Boss. NY NJ drastically reduced outbreaks. little real world test trusting become called experts, much trust abused media large... type following phrase exactly (with quotations, inverted commas) search engine choice: ""experts say""

It's eye opening. People get really upset suggest asymptomatic people might end needing long term care remember novel virus.

And we're talking potentially life altering disease processes triggered virus. Updated South Carolina demographics anyone cares Greek Gods: hold ambrosia. said months ago 
China adding lot Cl water supply. me, two possible ratings driver get, 5* 1* either meet responsibility driver don't. That's better loss remdesivir point.

It developed hepatitis C work, massively red beginning. get thing back break-even, that's huge win. ever said protests bad thing, would support current narrative. also travelling fucking far protest big cities, return back home drive numbers. 

What ever happened 6ft? Social distancing? Nah. restaurants caused this. SMH first comparison flu....

Then H1N1 (with Obama blaming)...

Now numbers faked cost Trump election... cell + antibody responses lasting coronavirus colds, perhaps. not, well . . . wants live 100 anyway? Mabey becase kids abusive unsafe house holds? variable. Around Philly area everyone wearing masks people allowed stores. makes wonder rural PA issue. hard hysterical mess created, deny created continue hysterical. Testicular fortitude knew lot people got sick March/April zero people personally since late April point. kind anecdotal evidence means anything, seem like we’ve got enough social pressure/educated population make work. Hell, even “I like freedoms” friends wearing masks diligently calling others not. modified New Hampshire state motto applies here: Live free **AND** die Okay, name fucking brain Coronavirus, truly Batman viruses.

*I night. coughing. am... COVID-19*

*flies away....* no, it’s woke virus. massive spikes entirely couple dozen people went bars past couple weeks states started relax restrictions definitely tens thousands people congregating close proximity streets. Na, acknowledge Sweden's officials well informed made deliberate choices knowledge consequences. California 100 fewer counties Georgia. Ohio definitely next hot spot. I'm state hear everything open, people barely wearing mask acting like COVID longer exists. 

It's weird hearing friends say they're dinning in, going KI parties. I'm still cautious public state. Agreed. live Chester county rarely see anyone mask even social distancing. density. SF's initial response virus meant bay area much better outcomes despite 2nd dense city country. New York got hit hard kept schools open, st patricks day, Cuomo de Blasio kept NYC open much longer cities. Summary: 

* government aims foster ‘innovative commerce’ – essentially, making better use infrastructure, retail cultural resources get people spending again
* focus soon turn city’s nighttime economy, initiatives boost shopping, dining entertainment evenings Same. Commented. ""No thank you, Dr Fauci"" still 2 days peak week. Although maybe tomorrow holiday. Facepalm data better. part! I’ve always interested theories, plausible, actually ended true. I’ve worried since January I‘m still wearing mask staying home now. I’ve seen many many many CT know exactly article saying though. lot think everyone everything get 24/7 backwards inverted 4D mind chess try control make miserable, course way counterplay complete opposite sheeple do. Start 60m people Italy.

7m AZ.

4,500 AZ deaths equivalent 40k Italy. It’s much worse incorrect analysis indicates. Neither I. Latinos know hate it. That’s 1.5% San Diego county, nationally. known case rate 14,000/3.3M 0.42% 1.5% true (in San Diego) we’re 49,500 infections. think it’s higher bc hospital, although one largest, exists two seconds county haven’t hard hit Chula Vista imperial beach love stranger :)

Yep, definitely greasy ass lawmakers well. denying that.

Thanks info!

(BTW, today “4th July”. call “Canada day” celebrate birth nation. know that? It’s 3 days apart your’s! cool that!) pattern I've using:
 like curves cut forgiving mistakes. Stop politicising this. California also issues.... .... Well.... least tipping big year, looks cool. got one either. one. republi-cans Wisconsin blocking that, cause ignorants need drink! Bravo Michigan sound minded. Exactly. genie bottle. don’t get hold citizens different standard others. yeah. go funerals pandemic. They’re not, frat houses campus sad thing is, completely plausible scenario.  Yeah still soon least discussion spiral reporting posts disagree with.

Not anyone cares. Thanks shitposting. Hope fun too. Good night. Damn missed start I'm seriously planning retiring outside US now. 12 years... I'm opinion likely article would published used term Latino. 

 Latino friends find irritating stupid term. want called Latinx. Upstate NY low infection rates right now. really risky students community long bring virus them. daughter's state school testing students arrival, asking remain county eliminating breaks visit home. Thanksgiving classes solely online Spring semester. came [this talks conspiracy mentality COVID-19.

Someone mentioned relative idea bad wear mask sick breathe viral particles. Someone else brought masks actually protect sick person preventing viral load increasing. sounded counter-intuitive me, obviously masks good, right? asked explain understanding explanation viral load can't increase viral particles. cool, I'll take it. looked papers rebreathing viral particles increase viral load, suggested ventilate space well can. Also teams [designing new rebreathe particles.

Can anyone knows viral load tell whether true, particles increase viral load wearing masks actually bad wearer sick?

Obviously anyone sick stay home wear mask home. must leave house, definitely wear mask. see conspiracy theory. input would great. places report whatever state country tells many states countries that. get pretty good estimate taking total number cases last two weeks minus number deaths last two weeks, since people recover faster others hospital time pretty well balanced still didn’t create it. None original concept his.

If solely talking roadster, no, didnt. talking Self driving, anything beyond roadster, wrong be. 

He one leader self driving, leader subsequent vehicles. design cars themselves? No, franz von holzhausen man. create self driving tech currenty Tesla's cars? No, created directed department tesla. 

But make decisions, direct resources, approve designs projects, make reality. responsible Tesla today say much leader responsible creations employees.

And really going tell think Tesla, think roadster? Nothing else? Again, agree, ***he create original roadster***. quit trying lie way anything previous statement. created Tesla today.

And clear, He's disinformational piece shit personally led people weeds bunk science. doesnt change history, much want to. *secret* plan Oh absolutely. Bonus they’re poor black brown. feds money machine goes brrrrr stock market, sorry. ""may be"", fucking are. fair, looks like actually nearly US need next months we're still seeing 1/4 covid cases worldwide.

It's also world supply several companies authorized produce low income countries.

Germany even issued statement already stock believe would need more, also possible countries actually competing US supply. wife boat. She'll going back work soon hotel coworkers complaining unsafe conditions. Especially guests refusing wear masks public spaces. said management doesnt seem care doesnt take pandemic seriously. cities biggest protests like NY would record breaking cases right . DC isn’t bad either . huge CA riots we’re outbreaks 


We still gigantic protests everyday still violence doesn’t make news. state that’s days 100% test positivity rate. Absolutely ridiculous worth remembering thing detained families wrong appropriate paperwork.

And almost impossible get appropriate paperwork immigration system closed system.

Unless marry someone, land job here, family really difficult actually obtain legal paperwork.

And everyone aware status.

But we've placed detention centers without sanitary products, feed rancid meet, use rape punishment. Especially minors.

This ethnic cleansing. means contact tracing abysmal want part virus even though I’m low risk group. actually states mass outside protests led much uptick, outside / people wearing masks people likely get sick / sick less likely protest.

Your words. conveniently leave they're deliberately data sets. due mass cover ups anything, protesters feel like protected they're asked contact tracing question they've attended protest.

**So contact tracing, whether someone attended protest asked.** Hell yes Eastern third state: ""Sure, seems reasonable"" 

Western two thirds: ""We attack capital dawn"" 26 times government hiding numbers downplay pandemic political reasons deserves news cycle outraged over. Hard find fault behavior unless becomes apparent misrepresenting truth personal gain. Ultimately concerned personal gain truth she'd likely still job. little left. blatantly wrong. compare dashboard states hardly different all.

If two similar, blatantly wrong? state blatantly wrong? contradiction. wrong? ""Schiavo said sought care returning new symptoms, doctor told likely due anxiety.""

He'd shit Uber driver too. take direction Larry kudlow /s spreads bars, beaches, parks restaurants. millions people protesting exactly 2 weeks later spike cases. 
I’m going vacation next week call protesting job fine. Got it!!  going January 2018? every state spiked then? would ensure maximum social distancing. speculation fact covid binds ACE receptors men's testicles. heard recent discussion articles since considering big deal would true, we'd hearing LOT millions around world contracted it. 

Just personal speculation really appears strong correlation viral load severity disease. much awareness now, heavy viral load situations mostly contained healthcare settings. Imho only, part reason decline severe cases death prob due people exposed large viral loads like early on. Better treatment options, medications, testing, awareness also likely significant contributor reduced CFR rates critical illness. like reelection chances.

COVID-19 Trump’s reelection inversely correlated. surrounding areas. family Bangladesh whole system corrupt ran terribly - family got virus number one priority making sure local authority doesn’t find area doesn’t get locked down. focused keeping quiet care people think it’s potentially saving additional lives.

Mods nazis. comment country name deleted political reasons lol.
But know users reporting one source. many got elected 1st place? Remember governor leading Florida disaster. Y’all haven’t actually seen infection higher rate yet. one alerted massive amounts strange deaths investigation started. Imagine virus symptoms whatsoever 6months within carrier afterwards explode. would recasting beyond imagination, incubation period long without anyone knowing it’s existence end game us. Talk Mother Nature cleansing Earth giving immunity. Y’all haven’t seen million infected per day. 100,000 infected per every 30 mins. viral baby bacterial u always chronic pessimist? leader free world terms gdp military might country thats fallen far? difference 8 people probably families proper support kids succeed. 

Homeschooling good parents teaching. already told school administrators would send kid back school, way dumb idea putting kids class stops everyone starts pathetic can't ever proud country people run claim love it, clearly don't. really drinking problem still drink home social setting? sounds like people want disruptions normal lives. Gosh scandal. /s create multiple bubbles move teams around normal. long bubbles secure, safe bubbles interact. wife already discussed this: kids staying home fall feel safe. think world flat .wow article posted holy shit ...Florida 1000 deaths far hiding what? 50 k deaths ? 60 k 
What good comes wishing states would done unthinkable like ny nj did. 
I'm guessing also believe huge spike cases young people bars protesting too.  Elon Musk confirming Tesla one unethical fraudulent businesses US history.

If anyone interested, [look SolarCity Elon Musk bailed poor investment duped Tesla's shareholders buying cousin's bankrupt insolvent solar company. canceled April appointment rescheduled early June. MMR 4 year old.  5%? “The successful country history do!”

Lmao reddit hivemind right here. Man, fuckin hate America post really lacking perspective. ever developing parts world? even spoken someone coming developing nation? Yes places America handled Coronavirus terribly. blame President, government much want let's fuckin real this. American people failed greatly pandemic. hardcore Trumpets, plenty open minded leftists refuse comply data/science too. People within community (liberal university town) thought common sense gatherings get togethers since third week March. People put masks despite overwhelming evidence helps stop spread. IDGAF President came said mask wearing made prone catching Covid, taking orders him/need president tell safe helping you. people turned presidency position King level power. digress... roads, highways, jobs, social programs, average education, low level poverty, diverse land. Go 3rd world countries report back see justify comment. Btw 1st world country simply means part of/and developed Western Axis WWII, Second World means developed USSR, third means neither side helped development. closer 700 new hospitalizations then. That's really really bad True. I'm north Bavaria, though, keep eye Austria, tbh.

One thing think problematic lies mask beginning. said they're useless. 

I know (to keep people going toilet paper them), wrong lie caused huge mistrust everything government said afterwards. guests didnt know value life what's best everyone refuse go it. wanna take risk. none new knowledge. Spanish flu ppl wearing masks social distancing. bunch ppl care themselves. Yea thousands people rioting/protesting nothing it. ya know..trump. country full nothing mindless sheep now. God speed Canada. Insanely stupid comment.

The United States excellent example build first world country, PRIME example build first world country.

The United States grew collection settlers powerful country world 100 years - small fraction total existence European Asian countries.

This opinion ""America embarrassment world"" pure propaganda (most likely) Europeans Asians upset United States remains sovereign nation 2020. Bill gates take 75 go, Jeff Bezos would like 90 dine-in. Right tell stopped tracking cases 7 days ago Take look articles comments get upvoted sub answer. possible good news gets picked apart enough double blind peer reviewed randomized etc simply written ""just wait \_\_ weeks "" - think 2 weeks pan 6-8 weeks.

Meanwhile purely anecdotal provably wrong info upvoted top taken gospel, long supports virus super duper deadly scary us locking everything forever. Yea gotta keep people alive artificially long possible milk benefits get. Smart! needs quality life! universities moved Thanksgiving break go till winter break order avoid students going home Thanksgiving returning weeks campus leaving winter break  Sorry mean laughing. I'm happy guys. Alex Jones anti mask protest capital 10000 person fireworks show. I'm hopeless home hopeful rest world. much Texas. They'll stop pumping market November 4th. still careful even everyone every single thing right. new health code stuff Florida actually made points contact/contamination (eg., switching pumps individually packaged creamers. liquid directly touching gloves aren’t able switched point contact.) 

Yes, masks, gloves, extra hand washing it’s far safer stay home. Outside job still practicing social distancing wouldn’t going didn’t mean financial destitution. 

It really blows decide life livelihood people got bit stir-crazy. Two? Maybe 10-20? Europe caught 10% cases back ICUs surging tests people symptoms. NYC caught 20% theirs. take account Spain 12 ICU beds 1000 people, USA 37, stritct confinement not... Well, know make numbers... 

I believe USA going show us level chaos still seen pandemic. Attendance protest - 1 point Hopefully become new Dixie Chicks actually deserve time. critics allege Dr. Anthony Fauci recklessly damaging economy blocking treatments like hydroxychloroquine shutting businesses.

Fauci authority shut businesses Hydroxychloriquine work mean, fair, 130K(though, personally, excess mortality leads believe like 175-200K) deaths *still* less 1% population. heinous, catastrophic, America third populous country Earth. Europle relies US every aspect defense. You’re able spend extra money social programs dont need army.

You’re welcome, doubt we’ll get thanks. don’t know, think PA follow closely. Every time go I’m one mask on. going see spikes soon PA.  Well, keeps saying boosting immune system better strategy masks isolation, calling government encourage better nutrition form Coronavirus mitigation. don’t think he’s right it’s like he’s virus denier. Wow, sending videos neighbours, know political likes? even know names neighbours, live townhouse lol. sociable beast are. working Limbaugh? holy shit, must've hit pretty bad non existent social distancing rules. Idk taking out😭 oiled cocks virus interesting. It’s deadly lethal you’re clock around people, contributing economy, country music concert church, totally harmless you’re work protest/rally. whoever made ask kid rebuild works mobile? Thanks. sending kids back school september. docs cherry picking science kind funny funny sort way governor's took seriously protested reopening called names sun back March/April/May that's gotten quite bit quieter places currently ""naughty list"" US. 

I greatly concerned hotspots going migrate back around places thanks travel/vacations/etc. We're wild ride least fun way. matter? really going trust numbers Florida puts out? Well would us 258,000 387,000 people US since 129,000 deaths far. great economy. 

Side note, [the military banned survivors coronavirus joining last people don’t follow rules saved day.

As understand it, politician move. states wanted move together putting last rules together, Söder wanted first savior.

Even like Merkel, glad scientist ruler. ""true conservative news"" - lol thing immediately blame faculty this. excluded decision making like least cases.  Wait! response? Oh right, 1,200.00 bucks, back work human capital. exactly could create bubble enough fields 13-16 games per week?

I also want point distribution mostly teens ward. NICU smallest patients.

And young children milder symptoms, difficult know pneumonia.

My pediatrics staff convinced lot sick children imaging done symptom intensity less, they're less sick.

When little kids come us, they're usually quite sick clear reach much later reach adult counterparts. real braindead shitstain turn good news vitriol like that. fucking football game, pandemic. laughing die. people country fucking retarded -an american Lol Herd immunity simply means virus cant spread cant find enough people infect. really anything deaths number new cases goes deaths eventually decline too. Augh. Complaining wore mask? What, wear one made food?

That’s even worse thought. People suck. I’m glad tipped really well times I’ve gotten delivery since February. Dude sub /r/politics covid. even mention US might worst thing world get downvoted oblivion Best way avoid people stop selfish assholes try follow rules.

Nobody likes snitch, it’s problem people behave. America making amazing progress. Pence head coronavirus task force recently stated wear mask certain circumstances (he qualify statement. said need wear masks)

And Florida going kind honestly report hospital Covid19. lie it.

Man winning!! Amazing coordinated response top officials. much respect nation putting foot lower numbers. complete weekend shut great idea. think private insurance great equalizer.

We’re time we’re trying best cease racism. comment like insulting white people privileged people. 

That’s fucking stupid. grew wealthy area tell people EVERY race. 


Stop reinforcing shit. US Winter coming. know y’all angry make sure vote better year last time. Maybe things would change 10+ 20+ year asshats got office. Oh no, inflating numbers. don’t know anyone died covid. /s funny. military spent billions training preparedness survivor bio warfare can't even keep people safe virus. wonder part ""infectious"" understand? idiots would run courses time normal fashion. Common sense says way test everyone first, break class groups six, run classes multiple times 24 hour days, install barriers barracks, etc. course. living Korea start corona end 2019 peak February nothing area (Busan) shut except schools. 

The economy suffered bit tourism, manufacturing shipping since Korea busiest ports world. 

Korea never shut completely, cancelled school, kindergarten college, since school year starts March there. Schools already opened hybrid online class formats, mask orders distancing applied. 

Private academies (hagwon) even remained open whole thing, owners academies option stay open close themselves. 

They true non-school shutdowns bars restaurant capacities Seoul Itaewon club outbreak March. 

Before people going lives cautious, also wearing masks everywhere.

Companies took upon make WFH orders, people shopped online instead in-person, churches services, many people voluntarily stayed home prevent exposure spreading. 

They eventually implemented fines people tried ride public transport without mask. 

The key difference two countries sense community good individual good.

3/4 things said either partially wrong entirely wrong thought sailed west side Quabbin you’d fall Earth education! would think that, lot kids simply learn adequately parents. need third party actually learn. tell do!

Apparently pulled shirts mouths, constitute proper mask. didn’t watch video, gather woman wasn’t wearing anything all. major protests NYC past weeks spread stayed constant. compares New Jersey, state seen protests level NYC, also decline.

Comparatively, states reopened seen spike cases.

Unless spike states like NY, see protests contributing factor. care enough little old lady store bother isolating? get recount? Take all, we'll keep masks Europe. Seeya people honestly expect interconnected, culturally-relavant economically sound country planet 300 million people would get rid thing? Yes think said first time daily thread, ive following sub months. actually politics, direct question gathering large groups people pandemic, wrong - directly relevant sub. lump ""you guys"" - idea talking assume derogatory. Teachers forced continue teachers. Forcing parents teachers really adequate solution. Cowardice? No, believe would dollar. put dollar well. maaaagic Wonderlaaaand also doesn’t mean still immunity. probably do... I’m taking chances. Lol. Thats actually good hear . silly florida facing dumb accusations since luntic lady lied creating death tracker lied credentials (lol.facts) cases .to like people say already cure cancer hiding can't make money ..or 911 inside job 1000s people wiring wtc explode ... florida hiding massive cases ..all would require sorts people keep mouths shut ... possible... people leak shit true already way giant secrets known 100s people kept . Big overlap faith-base, believing impossible second nature interviews I've heard read ""open schools"" demographic, always talk weighing risks benefits keeping children home versus potential get sick school. None ever run numbers risks children's family members versus child's health.

Does child's developmental need social contact education formal setting outweigh health impact - say - kill one family members really wanted finger paint? economist make model outcome.  teachers? right make risk lives state invested money remote learning including less privileged risk would greatly reduced, perfect solution need enact policy keeps people safe, sending kids school endangers kids, teachers family lives them. also live here. Probably longer you. also go fuck buddy. Let guess, one people state sub begging shut tourism despite fact mountain towns would go bankrupt did? Thank god TABOR. federal money drives state can't go debt subsidize madness, tune change. tests = cases something something

big brain move right good take exposure exhibit symptoms. People end hospital issues immune system overreaction(ARDS, TMA), overblown viral infection.

So yes, next useless like Tamiflu. know like loose critical systems, want it

I find people know gone serious medical incidents sort whether cancer, bad autoimmune condition, etc., seem respect hell covid; people never worry actively dying going physical hell things like learning walk unable breathe matter much try catch breath care covid.

It's hubris. society partitions people sick debilitated, people even see physically disabled people regular basis many people facilities living situations see regularly. sight mind. put context, Denmark reports 606 deaths total 12.794 confirmed cases, 4,7%.

Sweden reports 5.333 deaths 68,451 confirmed cases 7,8%.

Texas reports 2.424 deaths 159.986 confirmed cases 1,5%.

Relatively, Denmark tested way more. total 1,1 mio. viral tests population 5,8 mio. Texas, 1,7 mio. tests population 29 mio. 

What might different Denmark reports COVID cause death patient died COVID infection. patient dies heart attack tested positive COVID death. 12.5% increase. miniscule. rate holds compounds, Colorado FUCKED month. That's works. stupid country. can’t give people stuff don’t die? hard? Yes think biggest mistake government, too. Thank god changed. feel sorry poor bride. faces lifetime hell. worried too. Hopefully Baker administration makes clear although great news, keep keep numbers low. Maybe get covid beginning semester gotta compare country one civil war come top... says lot, it? dare want live somewhere pays better!  Let's forget Chris Christie divide deaths cases us get tiny .048 death rate. Flu .1. maybe math wrong. friend saint. Personally medicine somewhere like Texas one taking seriously government helping, I'd really hard time taking personal quitting. thank goodness people like friend! think lot malls going survive this. already severe decline, put nail coffin lot them. know feel safe going one. problem post last paragraph.

We people lifetime symptoms. Period. Numerous doctors area Maryland nowhere near Trumpsters saying ""The things people pre-existing conditions acting CoVid weakened them!"" people get CoVid, survive still issues weeks months later.

I think correct that: CoVid weakening people start issues due pre-existing conditions weakening.

Then people start blaming ills CoVid actually pre-existing conditions, sometimes undiagnosed, causing issues.

By way: I've virus. parents died virus. well educated medical issues even though medical degree, could gotten nursing degree wanted it.

So dismiss posts 'Trumpian nonsense'. I'm ""Never Trump"" uber-liberal. NYC spring. Stay strong! ball boy? Oh know. LA last week. fam lived years. Different world there. Everyone wearing mask (here it’s maybe 25%). Lines around grocery stores, everything closed.. 
Things less business usual month. We’ll see happens.. surprising America lets honest. hope Build wall!!!!! give Florida Mexico!!! politicians right anything. Maybe? gonna it? System completely broken. kids without attentive parents can't teach would lag behind. definitely possible homeschool stay track, unfortunately there's large chunk families can't/won't depend schools everything. Still, questionable trade send risk getting sub-par learning due distancing/restrictions. Oh quality life better US Constitution ratified? say absolute stupidest things. disgusting disgrace rude selfish shame think Söders move smart time life. close connections Austria Italy, hence absorbed higher caseloads. Hence totally logical react harder northern states reacted.

Also Kurz' speech Austria going lockdown, sealing border military to. Everyone saw lot people knew thing needed happen here.

I never voted Söders party next time, forced hands fed gov, whose MoH sang flu song far long opinion.

I admire Merkels political smartness. Instead sacking Spahn delegated response Kanzleramtsminister Braun, anesthesiologist training. smart move.

As Bavarian happy crisis management govt, moment. trust Jared! please, know probably dumb question taking tylenol mucinex getting covid test done day affect results way? one country provides complete protection allows successful. One country, forget name...  don’t think person “Chinese trolls” definitely diplomatic tensions attacks Chinese government Sweden. Chinese government definitely reason anti-Sweden propaganda, would put trolling here.

This partially related Swedish citizen Hong Kong origin kidnapped Chinese government. also history sending “fake tourists” instigate fights Swedish police, filmed later used internal propaganda Sweden China generate outrage Sweden everything thread, fact horrifying. good ole USA cowboy culture. Ain’t nobody gonna tell can’t do!  Idiots. I'm glad saying that, hope something suppressed too. Successful drugs also make revenue failed drugs never made serious R&amp;D investments well. Plus there's entire argument Gilead deserves profit drug developed much. think deserve profit, drives invention new cures. LOL Florida A, we're fucked. Florida shining example things state government since beginning pandemic surge US. you. That's awesome news, guys. UK here, looking envy... :( 100.000 day start pandemic little known virus would ment around 10.000 deaths day, Jesus way Yep. shame - european women getting good ass kind porn. asking visor back! going give someone else wear? fast food places that? Same. county Virginia pretty mixed response.

There's one fundamental problem here, limited access reliable, affordable high speed internet. Crazy we're year 2020 that's still problem.

The schools survey parents asking they'd like see done. people I've seen social media, seems like parents currently laid want keep kids home worried extended unemployment coming end. ones wanting send back are, interestingly enough stay home moms(which make sense whatever).

One big problems plan place kids higher risks. 

My problem way school online classes like 700 links go to. Would much simpler make videos teacher teaching lesson like they'd normally class. keep getting responses ""I can't make kid work""...uh yes can, parent, ANYONE make child work won’t matter. younger kids forced go back school already well-seeded areas. “Hold sippy-cup” See sense? shocked news videos people getting hit cars, shocked news, videos passages history books describing genocide. would probably shocked see one person, would novel experience carry large personal element danger. Ok take Denmark's ~~final paper~~ constitution cross everywhere says ""Danmark"" write ""USA"". 

Send John Roberts running time. Learning [Alot](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html) would help less Alot imaginary creature made help deal compulsive need correct people's grammar. Schools money making endeavors. really data would like see. common patterns population asymptomatic? healthier average? compare symptomatic?

The simple answer would shitty diet, smoking, obesity, heavy drinking, etc would contribute one symptomatic seen anything gets granular it. Hopefully pay either. Stand strong ✊ Yeah, wife similar predicament trying take WREB licensed dentist, also Texas. mess. Anyone tests positive probably executed thank Edit: Btw, 40k cases per day 80 days straight. exponential growth 80 days. example start 160,000, total today. next 80 days # cases increase 4%. multiplying 160,000 1.04 80 times. use calculator try yourself. first couple days adding 6k-7k cases. end adding 150k cases. Per day. growing. That's exponential growth.

Yes, understand exponential growth. pointing high daily count we're talking hit many people. lot cases short amount time. get trying say analogy irritates me. put terms money everyone figures real fast difference $1000 $100,000. COVID doesn’t take away accomplishments. 

Congratulations, well done building life yourself. well better prepared pandemic educate child grow older importance common sense preparedness. Stay strong! Assuming job gives enough hours qualifying health insurance boycott Walmart. hate places like people Kentucky seem consistently stupid comes Mitch McConnell. long states keep getting federal money want, care country. medical terminology there's difference ""signs"" ""symptoms"". Symptoms patient actually notices, shortness breath cough, signs medical professionals notice measure, like low oxygen levels inflammation. patient may asymptomatic still signs measured instrumentation. mask forcefield

Guess time pull oil filter car then. What's point, right? Filters forcefields. Yes. want know. criminal. Everything’s bigger Texas know someone thinks virus go away day election. mean, lying protect public good sometimes really work..... doesn't.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thought America greatest country world making mask... Uh.

All 3M N95s know love still come China. made lot noises blaming China, ordered US airlines black flight manifests cargo shipments China full PPE publicly disclosed. real. shit flu like two years ago knocked fuck out. dehydrated, muscles bones felt like jelly nothing lying bed days...was awful. realized hard way doctor advice fluids nutrients sick words. Take care body fighting. certainly learned lesson. logical ideas pandemic politicians anything that's affecting people got elected. They're going blame getting anything done. media friend.

My father who's doctor is, trust uneducated nonsense. think right government want anyone wearing mask, saw people wearing think meant act defiance, requiring opposite.

I think really far many assholes country nobody held accountable actions. Make adult bullying illegal ranks thin quickly. something positive, least spikes tidal wave could been.  Good New Normal sucks donkey Unless get positive rate like 20% won’t happen unless ramp testing. think positive test rate like 7% right nationwide. open beds county neighboring ones peak NJ. Keep mask on, stay home, avoid stores eases up.  west Texas town moving forward Freedom Festival. Expected attendance 6,000-10,000 people. That’s one many massive local events happening weekend. 4th July going wreck Texas!  ...are retarded? Mega doses vitamin still dirt cheap still dramatically reduce effect CoViD-19. Pharmaceuticals completely unnecessary. Say now: reds care deaths COVID19. 150,000 Americans die August 1st doesn’t matter them. Nothing change. Yeah, good point. Would interesting see breakdown effectiveness compared age pre-existing conditions. look New York Times charts - they’re much better aggregating data am. look that, shows steep increase cases clearly began around May 26 (so basically 5 weeks day). grant clear increase deaths per day Arizona, - far - talking increase ~25 day ~35 day. Still basically range they’ve bouncing around two months. 

We’ll see pattern holds. good reason believe won’t, deaths data still simply lagging behind cases data. point I’d expected 2-3 week lag most, 4-5+. 

I’m policymaker, nothing wrong looking hopeful signs! Houston stopped reporting ago they've already run out. good education get herd immunity people able critically think point people's dumb streams logic.

You know, like thought, I'm really finding nobody listens logic anymore. mired conspiracies dismiss anything anyone says contrary. different viewpoint, must obviously part GREAT CONSPIRACY. able get anyone reconsider whacky stances. admire people somehow make inroads reasonable arguments without shut ridiculed. surprising we'd getting better treating thing, coupled many risk individuals adopting strategies limit likelihood exposure Source? Eh, one handful people know got 55 yo 450 pound guy cant walk 10 feet without getting tired said felt like bad allergies know healthy 30 year olds needed go hospital. virus weird yo. imagine fear feeling I'm sorry going this. I've got baby imagine I'd feel situation.
Your doctor probably best person discuss fears since know babies medical history gear answer toward that. 
Chances probably fine, course reach medical professional questions/concerns. Maybe worth getting tested peace mind? 
Hang there! Thanks. good data. Even everyone wear masks they’d still it. That’s issue We're getting better treating virus. However, person hospital stays like weeks taking resources people get sick need hospital care increasing faster people recover resources run real quick rate people dying rise also real quick. like bars, can't safe planes Chaos Sadly, think we're going need hit bare minimum 500,000 (maybe double that) dead U.S. conspiracy theorists finally start relent consequences human toll become inescapable. yea states getting higher per capita cases FL TX? **Canadians:** Bible Belt festered Covid? Good. deserve this. Well meaningful metric, death toll, Russia actually ok, numbers correct (there speculation they're false). official death toll 9k, good, im country 140 million isnt bad. many deaths Germany many considered pretty good, also less populous nation.  may change little. Maybe reduce 100 200. there's way they're going end it.  They'll extend it.  Err, we've reopened now. community transmission ~3 months we've back [alert level almost month.

Gyms, bars, nail salons, etc open - weeks. Heck, past weekend able comfortably take road trip Auckland Wellington mates.

This kind thing actually strong, proactive response. recent cases international arrivals caught isolation. virus test came back negative even though spent 24 hours vehicle practically touching elbows someone tested positive.  masks, symptoms, one us popped. 

How? swear tests garbage working right.  risk reward ratio experimental treatment disincentive private companies, public funding often used encourage explore treatments would otherwise ignore.

The $1bn estimate actually spent yet, estimated cost scale manufacturing, includes sourcing reagents setting supply chains globally. would expect able recover costs either sales public money, would ridiculous suggest pluck billion dollars thin air.

Without public funding would bothered R&amp;D would discussion, drug exist. Taxpayers angel investors scenario, covered high risk experimental research demand fair return investment.  think see point think agree you.   enforce though? it’s blocked governor fines, etc. would tossed court immediately. I'm wrong, someone already pointed picture another article. part arguing OP claiming person morbidly obese based picture face. also felt like implying virus gets young people pre existing conditions that's simply true. Chile Perú consecutive less daily cases day like 5-6 days ago, maybe more

Take mind 2 countries quarantine long time We've probably already hit several times Employer provided insurance thing obamacare. meaning. We're getting closer herd immunity. hate going supporting local business,

Same! actually restaurant since first cases hit Seattle. bright side, saved bucks so! Exactly! You’re part establishment, maaaaan. XD Since March I’ve outside groceries every two weeks every time go see everyone wearing masks. actually pretty proud Masshole lol need N95/respirator levels filtration due frequent exposure sick people significantly increased risk, good idea maintain proper seal filter.

If primarily using cloth surgical masks, sealing level anyway, beard cause much difference. get mine N100 block 99.95% particulates. P also effective oil, necessary corona, N95/100s stock. I'll get vaccine, maybe first one.

There bunch vaccines, using bunch approaches, development right now. think we'll end several approved public use.

I could easily imagine scenario pass first vaccine second vaccine right around corner looks much effective. And, building upon many-vaccines theory, might end taking cocktail them.

It's far, far early get good read - pardon - vaccscene. Hi! posted good chunk first half story comment above, fyi\~

I think part story key outlier among states **not reporting number patients currently hospitalized COVID-19**. Instead, state Department Health reporting **total number patients admitted hospitals course pandemic**. Agency Health Care Administration, meanwhile, reports different figure: **daily hospital bed capacity**.  cases surged recent weeks, public health experts nonprofit COVID Tracking Project, volunteer group become prolific coronavirus data collector country, pressured state start reporting **current hospitalizations, saying information clearer way assessing bad pandemic getting**. thanks. heard families patients coma romanticized view situation movies tv shows, actually horrified reality situation. Try 50k . Yeah, one going pay that. Oh honey, you’re pretty enough stupid. Kinda hard take attention FL, TX, CA hitting 6-8k per day. Nevada, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana getting similar cases per capita South Carolina. quit band today read band leader riot act weren’t responsible. side gig desk job didn’t need income cannot good conscience participate action might encourage others behave dangerous ways - holding concert. super high mask rates low positive test percentages might consider we’re texas - insert ralph wiggam “I’m danger” meme thoughts exactly. It’s ridiculous watching southern western states knowing northeast went act surprised cases going re-opening. feels like fucking idiots spoiled hard work we’re back square 1  Brazil might take lol It’s tablet point. IV given hospital 5 years Japan 70s FDA approved US due lower fatality rate less economic impact virus People petitioning various states least temporary diploma privilege. Florida Texas two states extremely reckless create superspreader event thousands people taking exam.  Yep. states ten times population (roughly) I'm sure ran numbers ten times cases.

Depending province are, things might different too. chunky number Ontario, we're also pretty densely populated reddit wants fucking miserable 24/7 doesn’t mean doom gloom correct anything positive wrong.

This entire sub needs read paragraph lol. People sub think world ending. can't ask people tested positive? say deaths down. Thats matters. China needs people sick world buy products again. ass. Yup, actions consistently stupid bad, like words. right this. demonstration larger point. really know sister laws family died Covid sure shit would hear it, would go funeral. I'm typing right now. probation something prevents going different city? need people go back work.

Then pay provide PPE. fucking blame people wanting go back jobs pay shit first place. villainize people wanting put health risk. utility bill $1,200 month? may want check electricity meter, dude. Even combine electric, internet, states water, gas, that’s insane amount spend utilities. recognize idea statement regarding motion evaluating bonus unemployment, either maintenance issues inability basic math issues. Come on, milestone. can't get sustained zero sporadic zero. end story important step. CFR diluted heavily right now, sure exclude active cases? punishment involve jail time course fukin idiots. Stanford USC studies well multiple others using antibodies stuff found mortality rate like .1% .4%. Here’s one  Plantation economics. source accurate numbers, I'd love see it.  Asian countries family oriented care family friends enough wear them.

Western countries YOLO. ""If get Rona get Rona."" cares others ""If going going me"" honestly thought reopening mistake people stupid seemed obvious precautions well actually going followed. looking states ever even hit relaxed Trump restriction, even ballparking CDC ones surprise we're are. 

When populace values haircuts health people going die. 

There's never reason keep dry good like rice stuff house. try keep rice beans dry/canned food like eat home get fresh stuff needed. canned fruit veg, canned protein like fish like could survive couple months without groceries easy. 

That said think shit ever going hit fan like thought initially. Companies filling back orders shelves still fairly well stocked. Panic buying worn off, panic really. People decided virus over/no big deal acting such. realistically way vast majority take seriously everything gets shut lose someone close. point everyone lost someone well we're basically herd immunity matter. view matter extremely pessimistic. I'm surprised licensing boards changing plan. Good luck her! Well, embarrassing.  ability live decent existence goes away absolutely fucked reasoning. Drug addicts people issues like mental health patients. can’t control addiction doesn’t mean deserve die good society die. Correct. Approximately 2.062 million people. context, today's increases per million, Bexar: 614.9, Texas: 157.3, USA: 117.7

So Bexar much worse Texas USA. course, also one day, Bexar much worse even 7 day average increase per million, Bexar: 318.5, Texas: 188.9, USA: 122.4 thought allowed report anymore? expecting cases drop 0! /s Sure, agree. powers need people go back work. Yes please. Keep border closed 2021. Sorry America, brought yourselves. vote keep it, reduce zero welfare billionaires. going enforce interest becoming mask police

Maybe that's Hong Kong good virus! told someone Orlando. read post FB aunt announcing masks get absolutely nothing, everyone wearing sheep. I.......am disappointed. totally understand. Masks help! science. feel like I'm taking crazy pills. jobs? Stupid people willfully ignorant. Fair makes sense No. crazy someone could feel threatened mask would say something like that. wrong people? Immunity genetic, aquired.

And needs accountable makes mistakes, like human being. remember that. months ago assumed figured that. honestly still baffled this.

I’ll pay share, don’t want die thanks. Americans literally squandered 3 months time half baked policies eventually led us back square 1. could locked hard singular federal policy, enforced strict social distancing, mask wearing narrowed definition “essential worker” people genuinely needed out, would now. Driving around Taft HS right there’s bunch firework stands open. 

And wife’s cousin nurse telling us today it’s getting real bad. still take days off

Does mean hospitals aren’t filling up. hospital thinks save money cutting nurses hours increase staffing ratios will. hospital laid furloughed bunch people last couple weeks even though census pretty much back normal summer levels. staff isn’t doesn’t mean patients aren’t. unit educators managers work floor. techs scheduled 3 nights week, even floor full. Burn everything down. “Flat” terrible way describe it. Hundreds still dying per day. can't speak one woman died (I think NJ) found husband dying came say goodbye behind glass doctors like ""well, test here"" pulse ox like 53% something wild like that. It’s like assholes storing bullshit can’t wait unload onto people. Fuck them. Read Innovio company though.  need stand ground rule people approaching without masks. Chuds love it. approach w/o mask legally able dump clip center mass. get people wearing masks real quick. Rand Paul would Justice case? plenty people still think he's best thing since sliced bread.

Truth real world: Many people know family run fever getting CoVid test no-cost get safe.

People Maryland least fooling around many test positive, go home two weeks whatever quarantine period (I believe decreased 10 days onset symptoms?), done.

They get nowhere near hospital real world. take account coronavirus cases whole yes also many cases landing people hospital. one gets rich way. Hi headline. See tomorrow. Except wrong, culture war, side Fox News. People *constantly* use 538's 2016 numbers(again, perfectly sensible &amp; accurate) dismiss polls/polling, entirety.

Why would ever say 'inaccurate'?(or explicitly said: excluding) basis? literally gave Trump [the highest chance And, know, lack action fed gov't. fits narrative. remember sub everyone calling people protesting open businesses ""selfish killing grandma.""

I already suggesting Disney world governments Reddit friendly political left. See various bannings subs recently. shame virus become mired partisan politics. Let’s see one year. months short period. Plus China released swine flu 2.0 world. lovely country “natural” diseases. Phase four: Profit. Honestly masks. lot countries suffer degree another, really special way somehow every issue United states basic public safety measure become intensely politicized. sit seem like fault average American. guys inundated angry messages political pundits, getting people riled every little thing order work demographics win votes, news outlets selling outrage get views clicks. symptomatic system profits public anger. 

People everywhere need start getting involved communities, thinking building better future next generation. Us millenials gen z's love complain boomers wrecked world selfishness, great generation one think welfare next? country founded pretty beautiful principles, right imagine hard must even financially live u.s. We've done great job outlining problems, really hope start finding solutions spite may seem like super difficult odds. Anyway hope well best luck.

I've met Chase handful times he's pretty nice dude encounters, he's much dude Country music thing money surprise he'd one first start putting concerts again. it’s day before! It’s July 3rd door busters first 500 kids. That's call anecdote statistical outlier. Nice attempt fear mongering though standard? gonna party say welcome back too? Wearing material mask suffocating, stuff breathable. Folks probably taking often get air. amazing news took Goldman-Sachs report saving economy trillion primary reason wear mask. 

It's basically like told ""Hey, capital input, look here, save machine keep companies safe!""

We've really lost humanity, pandemic highlighted they're treating unemployed, stimulus, access PPE (both supplies small business loans), average citizen duped hostile towards masking, leaders basically allowed us flounder sake obscenely wealthy peers greed. precisely local governments \*should\* coffers allow sudden changes revenue. We're told 6 month emergency fund accounts. I'll curious see local governments public sector revenue continues dwindle. Going get ugly! would say imminent. still enough country fans dying. want push numbers further. Thank god Mississippi? Correct, think wear mask go back business usual. everyone wore mask, could go back *lot closer* business usual one wears masks. Please please!

I'm confused post enraged guy. chronic blood cancer put higher risk catching it, put high risk severe complications. I'm little worried. Americans already caught coming vacation. Apparently there’s loophole border crossings BC Americans driving get Alaska, they’ve abusing go vacation spots. 

Canada fining them. That’s it. them, yes. Others opinion government condones X, must wrong thing raised notion government 'bad' 'evil'. Patrick claimed Fauci “has wrong every time every issue,” elaborate.

Motherfucker talkshow host, guys elected talkshow host lieutenant coworker asked really scared I’d wear mask. said yes don’t want spend week hospital get ventilated reply “everyone know wasn’t bad.”

EVERYONE know it?! many sick people know, number alarming? staff wearing masks video saw No, shes going retire teaching job personal trainer. Ok apologize. non drug user, concern external costs people create, include innocent life. Especially get behind wheel. Depends live. states us already closing July 4th weekend. Yeah Florida sucks comes UB I've seen Florida plates driving around last 2 weeks 5+ years I've lived (from Northeastern state). definitely going spread way. Lmao yea absolutely long covers nose mouth. Even thin cloth bandanas effective containing much droplets. 3rd Annual! It’s tradition!!

/S  They're equivalent me. know go either find Trump flag. Well duh? one says take chances, antibodies 4 months somehow revolutionary. news trend stops new records. obviously going get worse worse. Florida's unemployment max $275. I'm sure we'll fine. Well, GOP promise cut taxes spending every year, one those. I'm glad dont .look around reddit plenty wishing happen .the numbers infected jumping like Italy new york .we saw numbers go 200 day well 2000 day week places .in texas Florida numbers actually looking like flu numbers .9 days ago texas 5k new day almost 10 days later 6k new cases. Im sure numbers multiplying dramatically like new york Italy. Im guessing spacing people im almost wondering virus changing .deaths ventilator numbers even resembling earlier outbreak numbers all. suppose could different medicines used earlier fact younger people ton getting makes think virus changing somehow. Whatever happening fact thing drastically killing less people get great thing .just thought pop head maybe people small enough encounter covid early enough positive somehow built immunity got enough fully positive immune system go haywire fighting . Yea sounds pretty crazy .. Minsinformation?, fits american zeitgeist agree shouldn’t put lives hold, virus also easily transmitted people would bring elderly/high risk group. live high risk parents, personally don’t much going out. there’s difference open nation/world virus run rampant, people dialing back lives health well society though.

truthfully, US could’ve prepped better there’s arguments there, leave alone though we’re without now, manage we’ve got. system place can’t afford stress covid puts medical infrastructure; means can’t afford everyone going lives like normal unfortunately. 

it’s obviously foolish say, pushing keep everyone inside we’re absolutely certain it’s safe. but, opening guidelines restrictions. I'm sorry lost no, trying make political point one side mean burst bubble, guys wife died hydroxychloroquine use super smart guy, wife investigated murder now. really nothing trump said. months ago elderly preexisting conditions common age 37. Give months us dumb Americans protecting “living lives” it’ll common kids. already learning asymptomatic cases causing lung damage. awesome. Actually, many people paying attention. problem many people relatives, even elderly ones, gotten virus sickened relatives severely.

What people like us often fail realize 99%+ people get virus? 'just another flu'.

It unlucky like mother ones pre-existing conditions like father, died, exception rule here.

Until deal fact third sentence? going get traction making c\*\*'s (you know term want use) religious zealots properly take disease seriously. Well fair op read article. 10000 combined people prior two years. like 5000 Well, can't fix stupid. think makes difficult victims comorbidity. underlying cause death could triggered virus that's way keep numbers lower. Throw financial incentives numbers get even obfuscated. sure surprise. One way tell plants check price finished product grocery store. Prices still quite high. 

Many states reporting COVID-19 clusters. Typically exceptions skilled nursing facilities. lack transparency bad highlights continue see higher infection, case, death rates. Get Reddit Except world rest us live never happened. 

Being fair Trump idiotically tried block sales Canada. 3M jerked rug using exquisite tact pointed since Canada bulk wood make masks would stupid violate agreement 3M Canada. put website open letter. guess someone speak spell box crayons managed explain Trump issue dropped shortly after. exact it. Trump broke law making request. 3M break war powers act. However stupidity demand dishonesty breaking agreement Canada allowed tell Trump pound sand impunity. Families evicted pandemic societal-instability new infections record rates, spread predictably go exponential-ish coming weeks.

President emotionally damaged brat without plan whatsoever except asking daddy Putin he's OK president, SS-like advisors Miller Kushner, rekooklimutt Senate actually prefers lower income scales perfectly trapped crappy jobs homelessness.

Let's overlook *extortion racket* American Health Care System inadequate supplies personal adequate protective equipment PPE everyone.

No, solution number insane people America. hoax, words echoed trump people. missed majority americans nothing lie OP? family charged coercing groom? mean, live long enough getting virus. Oh, futile. Meat packing plants slaughterhouses seem magnet Covid-19 outbreaks. well US, seen Europe - Germany, example, 2000 people got Covid-19 Gutersloh area, cases linked huge Tonnies meat factory there, 21 died. That's one example. explanations offered far include: bad health safety practices management, cold indoor working conditions, close-working, workers pressure come work even unwell, poorer workforce living crowded homes. make sense wondering something else happening - specifically whether meat transmitting virus. possibility? Otherwise, hearing dramatic clusters industries poor working conditions ruthless management (plenty about!). Thoughts welcome. can't value people's lives need ""keep moving"", retire. Hopefully soon enough made many people selfish like her. I'm Boston SW metro people see mostly good. Masks places.

The three tables took masks immediately, never put back even server came by, sat close other. think we'll okay, disconcerting. again. nice night left massive tip. wearing masks, ""pro trump"", pro virus. guy live trumps butt? agree online classes done well, OP seemed take issue them. Probably depends heavily institution subject matter, seems like could make work. opinion scientific experts, even going flawed logic NY state one highest turnout protesters US, comes since protests they've biggest decrease amount cases per day. explain that? logic experience floridian levels cases (a state significant protests). Wait hospitals run numbers go up. Also new ways treating Covid help death rate. managing partner 13 free standing clinics? aware ICU beds.

i'm also surprised name 577 hits google referencing email. And?

Problems like exist countries good healthcare. spiking happening counties refusing enforce mask ban. Also, California seeing slower growth Texas. makes sense. article says, many states place protect doctors emergency give guidance need ever arise. mean wartime triage yet. Since automod written Nazis:

I completely agree. want go huge rant, lot ""weigh risks benefits ignore risks"" people seem ignoring root problem generally \[modern American society prioritizing corporate profit human life quality acronym LSC\]. Like foregone conclusion need accept shitty situation instead shittier situation refuse restructure accommodate anything good people. problem vaccines work well. lot diseases almost eradicated, anti vaxxers wont really see bad diseases are. getting vaccine 1/1 million chance harsh reaction. Elope. kidding? wrong you? really hope so, highly doubt it. Disney marketing machine overdrive. [Pass holders already reserve dates. Shh pediatrician new rules since pandemic make sure everyone stays safe. 

We already appointment sons vaccination, called us postponed date vaccination(3 weeks later, first needed reschedule appointments avoid full waiting room removed children's toys waiting room, cleaned everything even already etc). 

When entered office 3 weeks later appointment one else office. pediatrician 2 nurses wore cute looking masks gave son vaccination(I wore mask course). really relaxing without parents kids. silent! son calm relaxed even cry needle went skin. thankfully thinks masks funny. 

I feel much better visiting pediatrician. waiting room full sick kids. like son wants touch toys waiting room(who knows else touched son?!). silence nice too. 

Our pediatrician super careful trust heart. There's need cancel vaccination. need make appointments advance, that's difficult all. think depends state live in. Mine turning people contact someone corona respiratory symptoms. filed part pua (due business closure from.lockdowns), lockdowns refuse return? fired them, filed themselves, refuse return? That's fair: absolutely risk chances mild asymptomatic cases went undetected. 

But seems lot less risky expected given precautions taken. ass 2 ass That's simply know antibodies even protect secondary infection.

But antibodies COVID last 2-3 months. even antibodies cleared, body still immune pathways likely protect secondary infection similar viral infections.

I'm saying need careful. there's lot misinformation goes around (I've seeing people say immunity lasts 2-3 months due antibodies clearing around time) needs clarified. owners temper tantrum people adhering personal belief pandemic shut businesses spite.

Ok...but get offered job equal paying pay back turn down. president seems think continue ignore bully virus submission. He’s still ignoring crisis, still saying it’s control, makes fun people wearing masks (!). Let’s see plays virus spreads base. US CDC also stated week ago every confirmed case, believe 10 more. 

Meaning total US covid cases reached 10% population within next month so. 

I think number may little high, 5% population seems right. First off, really expect IFR wildly different around world. testing = confirmed cases lower crude mortality rate. Iceland's crude CFR around 0.5%, much testing per capita anywhere world: that's native population though. Certainly would want US estimates. CDC 5 planning scenarios website, estimated CASE fatality rates ranging 0.2% - 1%, estimated 35% asymptomatic cases. means INFECTION fatality rate ranges .13% - 0.65%. best guess scenario 0.4% CFR, 0.26% IFR really tell us data. CDC estimate things want, might backed data. good thing CDC released data ton serological studies day. estimated number unmeasured cases 10x higher measured, (meaning IFR 0.44%, calculated using deaths/cases*11). studies around country validate there's ton cases know about, IFR implicated results spreads 0.1% Missouri 1.3% news CDC, confirming already knew. There's tons serological surveys across world. Every single one shows there's ton people measured, IFR much lower, estimates IFRs studies ranging 0.02% - Umm okay even don’t die still overwhelming healthcare system meaning many also needed care something else get killed. matter evaluation death happen one way other.

As non-Swede, want copy (and know nobody copy point), want experiment succeed.

I nit-picks though. say ""1/3 survivors long-term harm"". means, every study I've seen, 1/3 people went hospital. Since ~1/6 people went hospital died places, could mean something like twice many people permanent health damage died.

Toronto Mayor John Tory urging residents begin wear masks face coverings by-law goes effect July 7. 

Toronto's city council voted to make non-medical masks face coverings mandatory indoor public spaces help limit spread coronavirus.

""It respecting protecting other,"" Mayor John Tory said morning news conference, adding key element reopening city safely.

""We hope people stores businesses across city. want happen sake economy sake returning nearer normal kind life.""

The recommendation included report Toronto's medical officer health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, that was approved council Tuesday meeting.

Tory de Villa encouraging residents begin wearing masks indoor public spaces immediately. toads could doin work that's sure, every time get comfortable snakes slither make quick work em  live corona hot spot area germany. recently tested lot people work meat industry found ~1500 cases. lockdown people angry AF that. Like ""it's 1500 cases 99% Polish people work nothing them! steal freedom!"" like bro live small country small area. think 1500 foreign people working meat industry can't infect hang bad fucking news you. I'm trying say desensitised shit next two years next pandemic hits us. shows awful trump leader. He's leader. trust leader commander chief war. 

In war times firmly believe Trump make bad decision refuse accept responsibility. 

It's one thing defer draft protest war e. Bernie. Possibly school e. Clinton fucking Bone Spurs. Fuck dude Like said 10000 times before. don’t fix root problem economy take shit matter what. It’s going take bankers get fuckin shit birds get it. Interesting, wow. countries best handling Covid, one thing common. strong mask policy. evidence overwhelmingly masks work preventing spread virus. 

We self hurting turned something political shouldn’t be. embarrassing. believe hearing rest life, ""...to avoid becoming like U.S."" Hence forth, pretend I'm Canadian traveling abroad. public health policy equivalent ""well friends jumped bridge would you?""

We steady 200-250 cases weeks state almost 6 million people. Hospitalizations (total) almost 100. R0 (which stupid metric anyways) 1.0.

His stated basis nearby states bars closed, want people come drink party. beyond moronic. That's bars work. one going travel 1000 miles drink well whiskey bar.

This arbitrary capricious basis science. bars (at 25% capacity) possess magical ability spread virus, restaurants serve alcohol 50% capacity don't? 

I feeling owners sue. hope do, hope win. bounds. useful talk raw differences confidence intervals broad and/or initial numbers small, see example above. 

I call 7.1% 11.9% ""small"" numbers. Also really see point even 0.01% vs placebo 0.02%. different tell someone drug 0.01% effect vs actually cutting mortality able tell talking raw numbers earlier based context, I'm sure issue now.

I able tell one referring earlier. read paper confirm talking raw numbers. 

It issue since we're honest people bother reading paper 5% number misleading.

It seems like picking smaller number 5% since supports argument Remdesivir useful 40% number. can’t stay locked year. Possible, hard say. Personally pass smell test considering much likely main driver (Too fast reopening, bars restaurants masks) spiking cases, also much firmer geographic correlations. Combined effective treatment, good enough coworker coughing many times today 8 feet away me. wearing cloth masks. 

Im sure worried since live high risk people concerned. dEaThS sTiLl LoW

-idiots don’t understand die toward END 2-3 course immediately catch Danes, mean? That's news me! Got source could read? past 20 years donation billions charities, saving millions children poorer region eliminating dangerous diseases, fuck, even trying publicly warn world possible pandemic means absolutely nothing? 


Congratulations, living example stupid conservative. 

Cmon, then, go injecy Lysol bloodstream, I've heard guy suggested much much MUCH smarter guy saved millions lives. 





Also, ""LOL BILL GATES PR BOT"" sucha stupid statement. 

Who's say anto-bill gates pr bot, created Russians weaken U.S., making people reject life saving vaccine? 
Cmon then, evidence I'm pr guy, proove it. ""it's obvious"" excuse. human life means nothing them. care almighty dollar.

I’m curious old are, whether dependents like children? know people use money purchase food children? people “worshipping dollar” hungry choice: work starve. Money isn’t point, easier pure barter system. People like baffle me. think 100% people stay home, nobody working grow food, nobody working transport food store, everything “ok” “the economy” necessary? lucky people willing support you. put simply:

Lack antibodies mean immune, immunity t-cells. can't tell much pisses enough PPE hospital staff. also like put rainbow flag say BLM. Kinda seems like multinational corporations marketing department figured virtue signals profitable western countries, sure hell making pro-gay/BLM statements non-western countries operate in. strict enough. ban everybody outside New York New England state New York.

New York needs secede protect population. laughing crazy land known U.S.A. much earlier virus around 99.7% survival rate. US population 332 million. would still 331 million every single person got it... 2 CT. Connecticut peaked 1,971 hospitalizations 98 Probably would’ve worth month ago. Haven’t looked, guess. 

Disclaimer: I’m giving financial advice. La Liga Santander crowd noises used FIFA games. wondering many articles per day need issue changes it? nordic countries restrict travel Sweden. say infection rate must drop changed. None news since least last week Norway changed designation Gotland. new information?  Combination better treatments, lower active age infection, increased testing, deaths lagging cases. sustainable factors making disease less lethal, don’t go back sort serious restrictions, eventually deaths start going back close previous levels even higher. men it’s probably bit bigger deal. hair typically short cut way made conducive growing out. also grows frizzy curly. don’t hair ties wasn’t really long enough places anyway.

I went 16 weeks without haircut, 4x longer usually (the quarantine order went affect day pre-booked appointment, already pushed back twice). Last week, getting point would get way eyes regardless combed styled it, even gel. impractical deal also adding large number things bringing mentally. 

My barber shop opened limited capacity month ago. temperature checks door, station sanitation every customer, disposable gowns, indoor waiting, required masks customers. stylists wore robes, masks, shields. stations spaced out.

I don’t anyone else help cut it. didn’t take precautions, probably would buzzed head. everyone clippers hair ties hold back. wasn’t reasonably safe precautions taken, may hacked away scissors, realistically would helped marginally front sides. lock 4th (doubtful), hospital system absolutely worse shape Italy within 2-3 weeks. They've already passed point guaranteeing worse New York past week. That's actually unsual, right scientists think spread extremely uneven, super-spreaders infect dozens people infect one, ""The consistent pattern common number zero. people transmit.” thought interesting read. 

Edit: seems people infect others happened alone peak infectiousness, might opposite super spreader, possibly unusual low viral load. Homeschooling outside work hours, something keep entertained between. 

All parents know ideal, whole fucking pandemic ian't ideal either. It’s fun games love jesus, bible, guns students don’t mix instructors? intolerant ignorant statement. Since become acceptable generalize large swathes country like that? Take hate ignorance somewhere else. matter. Americans brains goldfish. ""Didn't happen me, matter."" children watching 4th July car. Why? people less afraid virus others Donald must pulling wig off, gonna 200K October keep pace. way hell helps reelection chances. 

Sacrificing base elected him. smart ask me..  I'm strongest antihistamines already, plus various drugs without I'd die sat cat house longer day. still prevent symptoms even strong dose. I've got one lodgers bedrooms gone back parents due work. hopefully enough keep worst allergens away. 

Allergies really suck. I've work ofr nearly 4 months touched meds come contact cat hair all. 'm dreading going back allergic everything! Hope continues improve :) keep safe! go park isnt many people. easy stay away others. Specially suburbs. guy human garbage, plain simple. How, Alameda county this? Thank god someone look Jeff Bezos. lived hill towns near Vermont border years bummed move. Well, Apple stupid. want liability comes opening stores high risk areas. want right need roll right back lockdown make stick California counties huge, though. next county might hours away. like East coast. Hispanic technically race. Many considered white. white non-white Hispanics.

I’m really even sure exact rules classifying race “brown” Hispanics. multiple flights everyday germany us Thank post. wanted comment became sad reading “if afford it.” It’s unfortunate thought crosses mine millions Americans heads medical issue :(. people dealing lack public restrooms? using bottle? everyone fortitude hold get home? No, get race ethnicity different things. Or, least may good reasons treat differently.

My question there's variety? Asians? Native Americans? numerous categories? Yeah :C almost though President trying destroy America's reputation world. heard Broscience?   Thankfully afford pay employees lockdown. 

How guys think they’re gonna use time benefit company customers? Definitely reinvesting training focus consumer privacy protection right? 

Clock’s ticking... last. Still waiting Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick produce medical school degree, credentials make qualified know Dr. Fauci talking about. rate Dan Patrick might well donate brain science, since practically brand new.

In meantime, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick bask glow ever increasing COVID death toll Texas, Grandma Grandpa's sacrifice. seems make sense, guess comparing in-person classes virtual classes students campus. think happens dorm rooms, students locked closed quarters worst situation preventing virus spread.

If compared in-person classes virtual classes students coming back Ithaca, I'm confused everyone else. That’s 1/3 counties California. Everything normal, everyone family working entire time aside mom works school, even back work weeks paid entire time off. literally know one work struggle all, ""working class"". There's tons places hiring around right people *actually* wanna work. don't, wanna sit home cry government paying bills. Hispanic means someone Spanish-speaking country, people Spanish speaking countries race. usually picture Hispanics part indigenous/part Spaniard, technically race Hispanic Spaniards conquered much New World slavery too, later immigration, it’s jumbled. Someone Argentina Hispanic may full Italian German ancestry, someone Peru full Japanese ancestry, someone Mexico may full Incan Aztec, Dominican might full black, etc. don’t time hand job! Look ME/CFS. it, many us docs thinking covid could triggering it, something like it. current Covid panic aside, people aren’t really thinking long term effects virus could have. Even people “mild” cases coming new persistent symptoms virus gone. tested positive antigen test took/sent Monday.  also took one last Thursday negative.  sensitive / quickly antigen test detect virus? I’m wondering back timeframe got infected idea (currently asymptomatic, quarantining).  I’m taking nasal swab tomorrow confirm. Changes nothing school calling “remote” basically class zoom specific times vs online sign whenever situation. right, definitely break ages skewed, imo, they're calling 16 17 yr old teens children lumped 5 year old children.

Still scary parent. Damn, new brides life definitely ruined. India, widow especially rural area carries certain stigma. stupidity gathering despite many efforts prevent exactly government lockdown. Tons people saying this, still see time reddit. picture worth thousand words. look photos two together observe Pence's face. expression happiness very, rare. Sometimes manages put tight control neutral mask. Trump's long suffering wife much better Pence is. commonly wears expression self pity exasperation. common expression far, however, disgust, patently obvious disgust shines like beacon night. 

The reasons obvious. First Pence actual conservative, granted strange American kind mixes fundamentalist Christianity, real conservative nonetheless. Trump guiding ideology whatsoever. chose Pence running mate sole objective tightly binding religious right fan club. worked, matter depraved mendacious Trump may part base still manages avoid seeing obvious applying standards morality claim creature black lagoon. True, fear commonly 'losing' modern world binds well, Pence perfect foil smooth dawning realization hitched wagon very, bad horse. 

Now lets look comparison two men. Pence everything Trump not. less scandal free. sexual history may contain skeletons nothing compared Trump's, exist well hidden. much intelligent intellectual greatly knowledgeable Trump. manners dignity. plan coherently. consumed lifelong fear inferior engage juvenile game constantly tearing others. personal finances probably entirely blameless reach decades long career dishonesty Trump's have. thinks speaks, lacks pettiness vindictiveness Trump pours daily basis infinitely confident worth. 'complexes' there. even goes far fact much better looking T. 

One could go on. far better man ways. knows Trump knows it, bound together necessity. careful enough never say anything publicly, comparison obvious. can't anything now, win next election subsequently T's luck goes bad move speed light invoke 'mental incapacity' power company Cabinet move funny farm. 

So look dozens upon dozens photos find obvious. look personal favorite, Angela Merkel finally got fed jackass leaned desk give flinching Trump piece mind. 

Then here's little puzzle you. Trump bad habit, one quite appropriate cowardly schoolyard bully never matured. Find photos. find set photos one person whole world never dared try dirty trick on. Get back can't find it. Удачи. well entitled catching virus Arizona starting. Italy basically done. couple months, Arizona going deaths much like Italy. lot probably died selfish idiots going whatever ""well gonna kill *me*."" whole bunch people lived deal long-term organ damage chronic fatigue.

Just deadly Plague release basic human decency. paid develop themselves. It’s pretty rampant. 

Even young “influencers” recording videos public places without mask, flouting safety measures. example, Coaster Studios, somewhat popular rollercoaster YouTuber started going amusement parks reopen, posting vlogs showing zero regard social distancing. Jesus Murphy. fireman need court order enter burning house rescue baby? Quarantine bloody punishment, water damn fire!  course protests caused increase. pretty clear vast majority increase bars restaurants. I’ve seen photos practically one masked up. ages stupid conservative states... No, think u liar conspiracy nut. maybe dont wanna deal putting taking wverywhere go   dooms day pandemic movies, humanity always dies deadly fast things spread. Guess never really thought stupidity factor. top comment? angry mob mentally absurd sub. Tesla far consumer friendly car manufacturer point time. everyone forget dieselgate? GM killing EV1 back 90s? let's get arms handful workers would show work call anyone. Yeah, think novelty threw everyone off, even conservatives. Imagine trying pull another lockdown fall? Good luck.. said ""deadly"". question, survivors least, deadliness. Go ahead post smug reply ignore everything else post. know attitude contributes people caring anymore. top post? big story teaches people stay large gatherings. story isnt groom dieing virus spread 100 people attended. NEWS virus like NEWS times BAD NEWS. old way? best interests.

Their best interests like roof heads food tables? I'd like see game wear high altitude trainer masks modded P100 filters. 

Then add inflatable sumo suits social distancing Well Trump could used Defense production act months ago masks would know with...

But didnt Oh ordering one I'll take limau ais 2 roti bawang 😂 I'll back soon safe travel. seen dad 3 years now. I'm I'm Germany we're much better home country uk. Things slowly getting back normal here. Hope numbers keep LMAO can't tell many times I've heard car accident anecdote. gotta biggest urban legend pandemic  Latino people actually want called Latinx? Seems like white people ones use bullshit. Heard 2 weeks ago. Also 2 weeks that. 2 weeks that... Hispanic race; indicates ancestry Spanish-speaking cultures. Among Hispanics, people mostly white European heritage, others Black, many mixed heritage Europe, Africa &amp; Native American tribes. census forms make distinction racial categories Hispanic/non-Hispanic classifications. That's second stage lockdown.

The initial lockdown like America, effective.

The Chinese sent medical teams Italy like ""WTF? see people outside. need stop that!"" Italians got lot serious, got virus control.

America flat refuses learn anyone else. asinine. True perhaps generation two turn around. 

But right right got. guys hit hard early on. I'm sorry loss glad Italy road recovery. Rimanga sicuro! bad social media posts already know COVID positive students rest party attenders figure ""covid"" party go get tested, send test bill irresponsible COVID positive students. use student loan pay those!

Hopefully none infected end long term consequences (dialysis, scarred lungs death). Except Italy free healthcare. looking forward tantrum 30% state throw. Watching people lived 5 decades feign outrage public health measures getting old. Excess deaths means nothing since mostly estimates way know actually exactly many would died without virus, obviously every country want show good light sweden much every country trying hardest attribute every death every thing covid. short prefer believe science. NYS already begun indoor dining. use: vacuum liner bag, dryer sheets, bags shoes purses come in, laundry travel bags made it. material woven like cloth like pressed, makes sense. heard use paper towels, too, even wetted fused together. absolutely mandated IEP. even known that. months went kept thinking surely would offer advice suggestion still addressed. supposedly waiting hear school look like.... true all. study UBI groups work new mothers young adults around 20/ go back school.

What recorded 17% increase part time employment 301% increase self employment Article wishful thinking :

 

 Prior infection HCoVs prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection related MIS children. Children develop neutralizing antibodies SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

The Swedish study also fails say T-cell-immunity guarantee immunity present viral diseases body cannot eliminate like HepB. Also think measured T-cells Drosten group pre-formed healthy individuals. hate re-runs. Unfortunately, Coronavirus actually attendee well! Monday, Mr. Berenson quoted messages he’d received J.B. Neiman, managing partner general counsel Texas-based health care company owns 13 free-standing clinics, got touch “wants people hear story opposed mainstream Mr. Neiman June, tested 2,231 patients (data last Thursday). Positive rate close 20% (was 4-6% May). Vast majority cases mild mild symptoms. Average age people getting tested different patient (in terms age) we’ve seen June. patients would met criteria previously (and health facilities had) Covid testing. testing kits able test broader group we’ve hospital transfers Covid. Vast majority patients better within 2-3 days visit would described cold (a mild one that) symptoms related allergies. We’ve often provided steroid shot antibiotics. time follow-up calls, patients longer experiencing symptoms. often say shot really made terms driving ER — Roughly 1/2 told employers get test. sneeze cough employer tells go get tested. 1/2 want know. mild symptoms (and don’t symptoms game system check box symptom get test — cannot get test unless present symptoms. symptoms send away — happen.)
He average length stay Covid patients 3-5 days. Much lower patients seen April early May. symptoms also milder. patients ending ICU. hospital ICUs filled really sick people non-Covid issues. [didn’t] come earlier scared super sick. multiple sources different hospitals — plenty capacity shortage acute care real data breakdown patients Covid hospital Covid. Recognition patients tested Covid percentage patients listed Covid patients non Covid symptomatic hospitalization rate somewhat driven hospitals taking normal patients medical heard several stories discharge planners pressured put Covid primary diagnosis — pays significantly better. Hospitals want avoid discussion don’t risk another shutdown. may explanation gap hospital executives saying plenty capacity increasing number Covid hospitalizations. open hospitals normal medical care test everyone patients — result higher percentage patients Covid — Mr. Neiman summed based seeing facilities, information really positive story. **You people testing positive really minimal symptoms. means fatality rate less commonly reported,” said.** data it’s already fact cause spread. Good day racist. :) Keep mind, obesity rate Italy lower Murica.   China's plan working need that. first vaccines go risk: health workers, elderly comorbidities. taken care vaccines available general public. can't find source right I've seen plenty medical personnel say much.

So worry, time comes, take vaccine help create herd immunity cannot vaccinated Tennesseans: anyone know stage reopening right now? mean state whole, Davidson independent counties. haven’t seen governor hold Covid briefing ANYTHING specific probably since early June, besides extending state emergency another month earlier today. 

It’s like he’s far busy encouraging protests passing ridiculous abortion laws even consider us might want stay updated one biggest things happening across entire damn planet right 🙄 campaign taking away reproductive rights. Everyone right reproduce imo. people, means raise kids, chose to. increases burden bottom long run.

How fix education? fix health care? make better everyone?

I'm ears. ""could"" ?! industry requires physical interaction. state already announced second lockdown. opening heavily restricted.  Quit Facebook anyway. fear deleted Facebook anyway zero negative impact relationships family. can't wait gaslighting talking heads tell us ""we possibly known."" Announce disperse frequent secret shoppers monitor compliance bars: they're fucking around, shut em right away 2 weeks. Hot kidding, that's lot effort put in. think owe first born. I've seen horror movie before, end well Wear mask want to. ""My wife's hospital""... ffs BMI fine average people it’s inaccurate people much muscular average, like college athletes Kinda like yours. Yeah I'm changing minds strong delusion. 

But course I'm racist pointing gatherings cause spread viruses. too, take us. would want to. That’s crazy, never heard yet. Could definitely explain cause baffled constantly hearing infectious is. think he's done okay. governors measured point 

1. Testing infrastructure state (California really well)
2. Contact tracing infrastructure state (same)
3. Whether state secured PPE hospital workers (we well here)
4. Whether hospitals ever exceed capacity

The fourth one really governors managing California even come close scary place yet. could shortly, Newsom exact right thing rolling back openings hopefully we'll avoid it. honestly think Fox News shut somehow world world much better. anti vax conspiracy stuff comes fox almost fox.  think Danes upset pay close attention situation highly educated. friends mostly academics activists think plays it, mostly CPH surroundings country too. 

I think based media, rather facts Sweden bucked Nordic solidarity went way, manner poses real threat neighbors. doubt well aware Finland's new infections imported Sweden. doubt *average* Dane highly educated friends are, worried happen Denmark. 

I'm glad issues Swedish Denmark.I've also noticed Danes good hanging people agree disagree with, LOVE since tbh I'm always polarizing person strong opinions lol. Swedes less judging amount hate personal attacks I've gotten online disagree. case, individuals punished messes authorities. step back give us time calm down. way ramp fear. roadblocks mentioned surmountable reasonable levels effort organization generally shit together. I've tell you: depressed people known shit together promptly resolving bureaucratic nonsense gets way.

I personally lost $800 could get around mailing form sat middle desk, highly visible info needed copy printed nearby, long 3-month deadline passed. Pretty embarrassing, kind screwup happens time prone wise minimize damage do. pretty simple, really.

At point, places largest increases cut losses, enforce lockdowns again. 

They're extending duration it, way. can't keep contained current measures.

The brakes need applied again, quick. really think people ride motorcycles without helmet chances crashing drastically higher car gonna wear mask? washingtontimes.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Well 1,000 protestors Houston, Miami throughout Southern California. protests concentrated especially Florida, Texas California. areas experienced increase maybe I'd believe possible. However, checked news month ago places good enough reopen. fucker failed enact mask ordinances, stopped cities enforcing ordinances. rushed reopen without go ahead public health officials real plans mitigation. bare minimum choice. Everyone gets hurt economically. pointing path normalcy obstructed anti-maskers. doesn’t change math - 7% investment public, rest private. surprised.

Sweden violating PISA rules inflate score surprised Sorry, heard news recently piqued memory. There’s definitely anti science mindset US. time, someone who’s pro vaccination tries maintain scientific mindset — can’t help feel hesitant? 

It’s don’t trust administration. don’t trust motives believe protecting people number one priority. 

But think Fauci best, operating rational, logical place. see weight life experience. respect Bill Gates this...

So ultimately, yea, I’ll probably trust say — again, don’t think “anti-science” captures full extent it. GA 1/2 deaths CA, 1/4 population. twice deaths per capita CA.

So what's argument, people wear masks death rate goes higher? drug available, fuck Trump Gilead. country make generic version Emergency Heath Act. - Doctors sending world brain damage Think many people know got covid think many people know financially fucked shutdown, work, unemployment, foreclosed, etc.  

It's rocket science people reacting way are. way around, people continue behave way. I’m beyond empathetic reasonable anymore. fucking morons get deserve really slowing testing. less people get tested we'll less cases, logical thing bring case numbers. buy liquor Sundays yet? 

Edit: Also: Yay, MA! rock! Sure. compare Ebola vaccine. say false? confused now. fair enough. short-term going ROUGH, though. fact don’t think face coverings reduce amount airborne particles spread insane. focused Texas California's numbers seem higher right now? It’s absolute fact cases spike prostest. Scientists ones first pointed out. get bro hate BLM you’re racist. don’t get end goal here? think you’re changing minds arguing online? Bc not. Now, GOOD DAY RACIST SIR :] Wow, put bunch words together mean absolutely nothing, yet tell *so* much person.

Protip: know absolutely nothing person, trying insult calling ""liberal"" makes look like bigger moron already spamming Alex Jones videos. they're outdoor concerts cares? enforce masks security kick people out.

We've effectively dozens 10k+ concerts year across country Better dead crack addict Trump. got sweet tax payer bailout. Ah yes, another headline answers question. No, really doesn't. already posted source article (also used one) three days ago decided infection rates - ; really, new information one. Probably above. 

I love preface totally normal, valid question controversial. shows sub about. hoax all. knew Maine requires every state (except VT NH) either quarantine recent (past 72 hours) negative test. side note: laser tat removal business seeing uptick.  think way. Herd immunity US would least 246 million people. think since 2.5 million official cases multiplier 100+?  think 25 million number epidemiologists tossing around. could even buy double that, knows. like enough tests. LOL, I've following Patriots groups it's... comical. guess truly thought would increase safety cloth mask, would. mostly blame California, Florida, Texas, contributing average 5k per day rising quickly. fact top 4 states almost fully responsible trend purple ""other"" section still increasing without top states, yet match historical high states April.

The inverse graph also Looking data California, pretty clear re-opening all. never actually started go down. numbers stagnated, really decrease. 

Places successfully exited worst COVID weeks decreasing cases. Weeks. days. pretty constant decreases, averaged like 3 days. Based [my maintain percentage increase we've seen past week, 1 5 percentages continue increase, even sooner, end August. far away. think people hold value independent ability produce labor corporations. doomers place mention states country’s biggest metro decreased numbers, successful proper measures, well, also grouped idiocy. Tens millions people 3 states. Yeah he’s sent home, title confusing. dire straits beat odds well enough set return home finish recovering (hopefully). mean likely already have. Even relatively low testing think April approached 40k number days. Haha, hey friend. Thats called natural selection going school COVID actually cause others die. grown Hawaii, know good many natives probably mixed feelings tourists. Yes, depend tourist money least lived biggest complaint heard much damage tourists did.
Hopefully take opportunity reevaluate approach tourist industry rights native people. doctor creates false dichotomy (the lie no. 1) don’t wear mask need ventilator. know ventilators right treatment Covid, lie no. 2 caused 96% people intubated NYC die. Intubation literally killed them. psychopath. one letting people die - $3200 list price, charged insurance treatment administered. Per US law, insurers must cover treatment COVID, hospitals reimbursed treatment people insurance, cannot balance-bill. 

Who’s dying profit? noise disease less widespread Italy (so higher lethality) based antibodies tests could bunk... love much time pulled old FHM reports back till 10th June. subtracted 29th 30th, 28th 29th forth got difference cases day. added differences. Guess what? It’s EXACTLY number ECDC reports offset one day. 

On average changes (added cases) made five days. there’s lag 3-7 days one day complete. Worth note negative changes also. Usually -1 -2. -20 midsummers eve looks like fuckup. 

Try don’t believe me. Honestly, people selfish consider people's needs. Even local media AZ seems glossing ""crisis care standards"" going effect yesterday. lot people pretty oblivious it. Maybe people start thinking serious governor finally closed bars gyms back down. Based experience MCLE requirements lawyers, need convince state licensing authority impose CME requirements. They'll never impose upon themselves.

I'm coach technically job force hand. job coach recognizing opportunities growth identifying risk help create plan based opportunities risks.

But like herding cats especially aging docs.

My younger docs super interested learning everything they're convinced every goddam bleed Ebola. know? honest already laughing. March ready feel solidarity supportive U.S. started thing again, like /r/funnyandsad world possibility 3-7 lost lives worth stupid sport? tell universities revenue depends it, dont give shit economics sacrificing children. Okay Sky Man people take part country we'll take part separate countries live together anymore, k? A. FUCKIN. MEN. Ahhh Rand Paul sort pontificating years now, makes feel better neighbor beat pulp get hospitalized it. bandana anything. wearing piece cloth face protected anyone else airborne virus scientists viral labs would dressed like Joe Dirt instead hazmat suits. long... Holy crap. guy crackpot political incentive throw bomb like this? Jfc.

I wonder health care systems holding up. There's big parallel reasons protest reason cautious pandemic considering one hand, professionals part informing us remain cautious times, other, complete idiots baboons running governments spouting conflicting information turning pandemic political playground. 

Everything going revealing true colors, really hope people never elected again, really shows guys can't operate pressure public needs most. Can't believe withholding information thing first place. Misinformation flying around high concentrations full time job sorting bullshit find real facts (and facts exist yet). People couldn’t grasp initial severity news outlets predicting anything extinction humankind virus worse common flu.
In addition leadership general public, want add media outlets let us worse anything former.

News outlets spread misinformation profit, throwing journalistic integrity window. one likely never believe anything media machine ever again, it’s rotten core, doesn’t matter left right.

I since cancelled cable TV, blacklisted media outlets responsible (all mainstream outlets found spreading misinformation profit, side don’t belong to.

The media far much power swinging public opinion, fact one could conclude two purposes currently 1. Make maximum profit 2. Sway public opinion side whether it’s correct not. example media blow covid like it’s gone forever move topics.

It’s also laughable North Americans criticize Russian Chinese propaganda machine, blind fact media also propaganda machine used way. people charge want to. medium.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Just like age, obesity one potential risks. know risk factors are, even wouldn’t matter- risk factors increase likelihood severity, doesn’t mean perfectly healthy people safe. Someone sent this. like 100% 500%. 6% &lt;12% 100% increase. 

Also even deaths pneumonia covid, still decreasing well.

Data: sure also counting covid. believe cause death multiple choices choose. could covid pneumonia. die covid. die suffocation via pneumonia related causes. Oxford partnership US too. planning equitable global Well sounds like poking fun people wearing masks outside nobody around, agree pointless. also harmless, whereas folks refuse wear masks true assholes. basing ""where deaths"" on? thing decided diagnosis death equals 7 days?

**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed.

And there's simple truth people drunk follow protocol. Here's Brooklyn last weekend. Bars allow patrons inside, folks flooded street ignoring protocol putting anyone risk lived street.

## Summary

### Background

Concerns regarding potential neurological complications COVID-19 increasingly reported, primarily small series. Larger studies limited geography specialty. Comprehensive characterisation clinical syndromes crucial allow rational selection evaluation potential therapies. aim study investigate breadth complications COVID-19 across UK affected brain.

### Methods

During exponential phase pandemic, developed online network secure rapid-response case report notification portals across spectrum major UK neuroscience bodies, comprising Association British Neurologists (ABN), British Association Stroke Physicians (BASP), Royal College Psychiatrists (RCPsych), representing neurology, stroke, psychiatry, intensive care. Broad clinical syndromes associated COVID-19 classified cerebrovascular event (defined acute ischaemic, haemorrhagic, thrombotic vascular event involving brain parenchyma subarachnoid space), altered mental status (defined acute alteration personality, behaviour, cognition, consciousness), peripheral neurology (defined involving nerve roots, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, muscle), (with free text boxes meeting syndromic presentations). Physicians encouraged report cases prospectively permitted recent cases notified retrospectively assigned confirmed date admission initial clinical assessment, allowing identification cases occurred notification portals available. Data collected compared geographical, demographic, temporal presentation overall cases COVID-19 reported UK Government public health bodies.

### Findings

The ABN portal launched April 2, 2020, BASP portal April 3, 2020, RCPsych portal April 21, 2020. Data lock report April 26, 2020. period, platforms received notification 153 unique cases met clinical case definitions clinicians UK, exponential growth reported cases similar overall COVID-19 data UK Government public health bodies. Median patient age 71 years (range 23–94; IQR 58–79). Complete clinical datasets available 125 (82%) 153 patients. 77 (62%) 125 patients presented cerebrovascular event, 57 (74%) ischaemic stroke, nine (12%) intracerebral haemorrhage, one (1%) CNS vasculitis. 39 (31%) 125 patients presented altered mental status, comprising nine (23%) patients unspecified encephalopathy seven (18%) patients encephalitis. remaining 23 (59%) patients altered mental status fulfilled clinical case definitions psychiatric diagnoses classified notifying psychiatrist neuropsychiatrist, 21 (92%) new diagnoses. Ten (43%) 23 patients neuropsychiatric disorders new-onset psychosis, six (26%) neurocognitive (dementia-like) syndrome, four (17%) affective disorder. 18 (49%) 37 patients altered mental status younger 60 years 19 (51%) older 60 years, whereas 13 (18%) 74 patients cerebrovascular events younger 60 years versus 61 (82%) patients older 60 years.

### Interpretation

To knowledge, first nationwide, cross-specialty surveillance study acute neurological psychiatric complications COVID-19. Altered mental status second common presentation, comprising encephalopathy encephalitis primary psychiatric diagnoses, often occurring younger patients. study provides valuable timely data urgently needed clinicians, researchers, funders inform immediate steps COVID-19 neuroscience research health policy. quiet pump-n-dumping turn quick buck stock market. wonder anyone aware update...bueller? I'm sure getting voted. need start distinguishing outdoor events indoor. Also allowing degree freedom outside might alleviate quarantine fatigue. think moment removes Fauci, lot people go apeshit, discard countrywide protests again.

The reason good chunk population stays relatively sane, least know ONE person fucking around, pandering political clout. almost went Cornell. No, joke university. for-profit institution though, everything US, means could certainly say anything keeps going That’s many students planned return off-campus housing Ithaca, New York, university located, would authority mandate testing restrict student behavior instruction done remotely.

This indeed make sense. online classes party house probably worse going class. Professors might something say it. take money vote hurt us? think whole base necessarily threatened due natural compartmentalization, big take away direct impact Army Special Operations Forces. literally school house produces Army special operators. idea impact force already strained. 246 deaths 2019, 65 year.

Could beneficial side effect measures place.

Before anyone points anyway, yes excess deaths due pneumonia also reported (roughly 1000 additional deaths, making 25% last year death count due pneumonia). California blowing right now. believing friends protestors going tell testing sites BLM protest totally believable. totally see giving government information.

This shockingly scientifically illiterate. need test individual protestors know protests likey caused uptick, instead take random samples particular cities see there's correlation (turns there's not).

The rest comment culture war mouth-foaming. I'm sorry data support thought true, self-searching try figure factors might failing consider. New york literally worldwide epicenter virus. forget 5G well! Good Mass able long remember haha. Rhode Island worse, liquor stores close 5-6 Sundays would drive 10 minutes back mass watching football buddies house Providence. front every ad there. Look refrigerator human, best shape, even virulently anti-gay person secret desires here. Corona dude, grandmother? Trump sells Europe DOUBLE paid! many deaths though? testing means numbers, news say death rates growing. could go wrong thousands students country descend upon small remote upstate new york town 8 ICU beds poorly funded local hospital constantly gets malpractice suits? Especially 21K students live campus adhere schools' guidelines. President even acknowledged people going get sick covid - students, staff, faculty, community members. Way go Big Red! foster parents North Texas accepted new placement late March - siblings, 8 year old boy 5 year old girl. Everything shut kids weekly visits parents Zoom. Since Gov. Abbot decided reopen TX physical visits started - involves kids hanging Mom CPS visitation center *which germ hub* 2 hours every week.  Everything else virtual go back in-person well. CPS workers physically visit every foster home case list month interview parents kids - takes hour. here's person circulating 40-60 homes month, going court hearings constantly, supervising weekly visits go visitation center, etc, etc. Weekly therapy visits also return in-person. 

We end placement taking break fostering COVID risk high numbers way are. neurological condition puts higher risk. BEGGED CPS reconsider mandatory physical vists said legal option. I'm heartbroken two kids. second foster home 6 months (the shut due non-COVID related family health issues.)  really traumatic. people bitching bars closed really need understand lot line able buy beer get haircut. Stay classy TN Hey Texans, keep scrolling. odd also say shit like people scream body choice seem process goes mask🤷🏼‍♀️ always freedom choose one one's body. call people boot lickers day time advocate universal healthcare mama daddy government take care exist, strange.

so think people wear masks, bet bothered come history, supported maskless protests wear masks, think people protesting systemic racism nothing filthy nothing noble acting like bunch terrorists endangering others.

so pretty clearly problem black part black lives matter. vaccines medicines work animals even primates end working humans.  Nah man we’re good economy back normal STONKS go Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Doesn’t look day older 102! breaks heart. still surprised improved much, bring death rate significantly. see, science discovery process near infinite variables case. Speaking absolutes future bad practice. One thing every single person agree getting worse US abruptly. person either part solution part problem. #Heros Wear Masks Would fuck lot people mentally hear “we got 12-18 months misery ahead us” hope test comes back negative. No, national lockdown firm messaging time Boris contracted it. Look great bash conservative governments day long please stick facts?


Was Boris slow react? Yes. narrative Boris sort Trump-esque head sand mission point contracted patently false. clarified elsewhere. attach ""waspy male"" thought tune point saving lives worth suspending economy.

And think easily pair training programs people want work make sure jobs safe.

And allow people want take risk stay home collect checks.  Good flex “We back”... posted...  Herd immunity takeaway goal here. don’t know long immunity lasts definitely trying avoid hospitals overrun, hundreds thousands deaths, long term organ damage. need include number deaths missed covid deaths. leaves death rate around 1%.

(10x infected, almost 2x making dick measuring contest, group hang consisted least 4 PhDs, engineers, programmers, translators musicians. Also HR people. It’s high low education. Maybe group judgemental group comes equaling Swedes disliking pandemic strategy. Also think quite polarized eyes maybe you’re one that’s biased people see polarizing?

Most people know open interested discuss anything disagree. Come think Sweden. first match weird, equally enjoying matches last weeks. enjoy switching natural sound enhanced audio it’s great. [Bing young patients dying Guatemala. Yesterday 3 year old boy. withdrawing someone’s paycheck depend isn’t ‘not losing money’. it’s justice happening public figures making millions well poorest among us, demonstrates disregard owning class labor public they’re willing it. Im ""virus skeptic"" whatever, look something like traffic fatalities way? Would lead us ban vehicles? first match weird, equally enjoying matches last weeks. enjoy switching natural sound enhanced audio it’s great. Somebody pissed can’t get Appletini Double acceleration!

MAGA FLU! isn’t lockdown sad live country values money life. He’ll back Pfft....the GOP controlled senate care anyways. Ignorance bliss... case following along, shortly TMC sounded alarms said nearing 100% ICU capacity, Governor Abbott issued executive order banning elective procedures *unless adequate number ICU beds available*.

The TMC stopped reporting data two half days, resumed removed many charts downgraded ""Warning"" ""Moderate Concern"" going way pretend like plenty ICU capacity available them.

Soon enough we'll people dying hallways they'll still claiming 30 ICU beds available. Why? dont understand this. R&amp;D costs also shared countries? must burden stay US countries enjoy cheaper drugs? Stop hysteria. virus isn’t serious college aged people. There’s reason cancel fall classes. isn’t I’m desensitized. literally choice. bills pay food buy, go work. Best wear mask, wash hands, maintain social distancing. Even then, exactly none co-workers same. take care wait get sick. quick quick? disagree variable exist. difference demographic positive test , “Florida’s Restaurant demographic” couldn’t get tested unless 65 older showing symptoms June. Maybe I'm rule abider, really think promoting people drink park good idea. worth risk. Someone's backyard, sure. original post kinda suggesting people drink open spaces great. am, federal land. worth hit federal crime. wonder virus spreading. Coronavirus test free period. real big story we’ve heard felt beginning it. Picture Middle East tent cities Americans kids thoughts California many cases still? locked early, think people got complacent time, leading recent spikes.

However never really squashed virus Bay Area, think people outdoorsy. [This /r/sanfrancisco shows people feel entitled hike closed trails still. idea SIP order go enjoy life normal. Yes, tough love outdoors, Bay Area, love outdoors, kind ""I think I'm fine"" mentality kept virus circulating long.

I discussion friend last week basically discussed point locking we're still going face massive surge now. worth it? Maybe argument staying ICU capacity holds general Bay Area WAY capacity limits whole time. People job stayed home, kept going probably messed lockdown us. possible doubt that. ""school house"" pretty insulated others. Like campus, different departments naturally separated, military training environments even due specific training facility requirements. area, ""open economy pro-trump"" protests, week later BLM, another round economy protests. 

At point, care caused uptick. fact one. 

Everyone responsibility member society everything power limit spread. complacent. Stop saying, ""it's me, them,"" wear mask, distance, forego family gathering while, part fellow man, selfish. Y'know, civilized society things. wait. days posting upwards 10k cases day. leave states dust. wait!  lot young people showing symptoms went socialized bars, beaches, protests.

Give another week, parents grandparents showing it. 

Give one week top that, hospitals full, see deaths climb back 2,000+ per day. Wtf??? guess even people put positions power leadership always follow advice experts organization/field. I've seen actual doctors use unwashed, ungloved hands inspect wounds, I'm shocked cdc director set good example. gaps around mask reduces effectiveness. new concept. Look 3-bar owning pos. Yeah gyms definitely closed too, without fucking doubt reason open middle huge 2nd wave global pandemic. couple months ago, someone posted comment somewhere reddit got ton upvotes people trot circumstance lol He’s already lied us masks yet still trusting guy. fuck right? saying reason line first get vaccine. first thing Trump asked Fauci whether could let run whole population get herd immunity. backed experts told millions people would die ""approach."" Fauci talk many expected hospitalization deaths new positive tests? Doctors fighting months. medical community figured (through trial error) patient put ventilator, survival chance goes way down. Like 15-25% survival rate ICUs. everything possibly keep patients breathing own.


There also several treatment options developed, likely combination forced educated guesses desperation. Remdesivir shown quite effective reducing severity symptoms. There's also plasma recovered people, I'm sure I'm missing others.


But might early say. Deaths usually follow surges cases 1-3 weeks know, may delayed. ICUs medical resources max out, death rates also go up. mean, want blame someone, blame top levels government absolutely lackluster response.....that's ire directed to. Well probably won’t work anyway cares. Seriously, aspiring achieve herd immunity (without vaccine) would like genocide. can't even find anything Google (.co.uk) fits description haha. I've probably never seen Send Department Business Oversight. Ah certainly moves goalpost far enough. unfortunately places lump together seems grow exponentially past 65 seeing closing public roads likely result lawsuit quickly wish people guilty, blaming outright incorrect. Americans selfish. dont like told everything dare try warn (your friends) something harmful potentially deadly themselves— endangering others. Thats lose friends get called controlling narcissist. hate people &amp; culture really There's PPE went guess. Nice corporation. live Boston’s PACKED day one, news even traveled knew opened. People fucks comes personal caution. Jackass sorry english first language still could understand think okay. Also endangering wearing masks. think slight difference stupidity theirs. ""Freedoms"" call us Lone Star State nothing! time like Yelp review, nickname... ""I wear mask reason wear underwear. Things gotta breathe"" - said saint  sorry dont believe sky falling, thats backed data. continue part going out, sky falling. 21 37. say crap let us down. Sounds like support failures office whitelies seen stim check? know. know.

But also everything profoundly dumb? srsly using ""but fridge!"" complaint eating well? that's problem walk shop day buy 1 thing going eat. FFS.

Why exactly kid need knife eat carrot celery?

You're reaching ridiculously far fight ""but wanna poison kids i'm lazy"" stop acting wise shit, good you. still wear mask... incentive research develop life saving medicine can't make profit! /s  I’ve saying weeks ray hope recklessness US countries may reach herd immunity quicker thought deaths, merica Elon Musk cares money COVID prevented making get people it, since easier leave going places, fogs glasses much driving take mine ear straps hang rear view mirror. think Grandma NBA yeah probably healthier grandmas. Personally think need ask Jah Rule thinks. new kind bride-zilla cali big spike? protest related loosen grip much? Hey, check many tests state daily? want see Arkansas slowly getting better factor.  get labeled experts? Welcome US, much hospital makes far important many people saved. And, that’s disgusting enough, many people US perfectly okay system. best numbers. People call time tell great numbers are. fair reservation forget (maybe worldnews) huge thread recently like everyone saying ""im antivax dont want rushed untested vaccine"" thinking like wow people clueless details. Someone quoted individual uses machine determine sample positive negative said DOH limiting apparatus supplied building backlog. Giving specimen doesn’t mean test ocurred can’t base that. odd cancer! met man MUSC left ear affected, make second person I've ever talked kind cancer. Cancer ugly anyone dealing dealt kind needs support sunshine. Keep keeping on! Yeah, it’s incredibly selfish. risk worth reward YOU, you’re putting people’s lives danger, control actions. COMEON Kentucky

 Flush Turd

 November 3rd Parachutist refuses remove parachute despite slowed fall. surprised America ends extinct end maybe contact tracing specifically ignored protests. like conduct poll Americans race, allow non-whites answer, conclude ""whelp, fellow Americans, looks like 100% white population."" sampling error. Well 331m people live US, would guess good chance (90.6%) receive one 300m doses. 

You may get one right away highest risk demo prioritized likely dose you. Well, that's difficult figure why. 


BUT point out-mid-event death counts pretty universally low, even without data suppression efforts, especially places underfunded public health systems US. We'll studying long, long time. local health dept reports one number, always higher (+10\~15) actual numbers reported state given day (then official CDC) usually two week period. think stretching death numbers make look less. I’m still furious. know people age complaining “going church illegal” govt control us. old fool, God would tell wear mask stay home too. Murdering people spreading germs making curve spike instead flatten isn’t way get past pearly gates. great way get lower pits though... takes lot time (peer review) resources (larger cohort). That’s step one multiple step process. actually way considering lockdown greatly reduced deaths things like car accidents. Well make post that. United States single country despite narrative you’re trying push. Yes, am... free ignore thread disagree with.

But are, talking trying attack OP poor translation make clear enough (for you) opinion health worker.

Meanwhile, one disputed content article.  Nobody said medical anomalies don’t happen. That’s unfortunate sad extremely rare. Oh well, people rule world. much it. 

Coca-cola owns half shit drink too. is. looking data bud. It’s pure numbers. guess don’t want data location you? misunderstanding me.

I'm saying I'm good risk assessment everyone else bad it.

I'm saying everyone bad it.

And I'm saying already vaccine it’s still bigger threat COVID bird flu we’d need vaccine deployed couple weeks. Bird flu could definitely get ahead ability vaccinate evolved person person transmission. cannot find information showing license agreements temporary ones list specific developing countries only. agreement restricts selling countries too. 

Do evidence licenses? stage landlords need take hit shut down. fair, really can't judged see things look months road.  antibodies last long time, countries like Sweden U.S. less vulnerable countries stamped COVID quickly.

I'm saying Sweden (and especially U.S.) anything right. antibodies effective last long time, decently positioned.  That's big if, cost many lives illnesses, but, are.  dozen thousand deaths never hurt nobody, right. nightmare working, guests complying caring, management letting sick people work, hiding possible positive cases rest staff. Thank Newsom. Avsolutely, connection wealth individuals genetically weak enamel enough explain group individuals dental health.

Bad dental health financially weak groups reason bad general health financially weak populations. Lack knowledge education. agree many members administration would anything benefit.

As Remdesivir specifically, safety profile already pretty well known purpose built COVID. investigational therapy Ebola quite while. wait coronabola. Bugger. Annoying people going die this, usually takes least month getting it, often 2 months more. (Patriotic choking noises) know what's weird. Obviously looked map, posted link it. looked right school north. Must Gator blindness. Either ways thank god UF and, guess...FSU, I'm sure either cities would Blue otherwise. got shunned, like bad guys

Some people feel entitled denial.  honestly don’t know much posted. physician posted mentioned seriously ill 27, 32, 45, don’t remember top head Tell Arizona. Get ready won’t ones seeing totals reaching record levels. California next. TX FL follow. see goes there. could learn NY. I’d rather wait get there’s effective treatment available reduce chances getting severely sick. proactively getting ahead eventual mandatory shutdowns. published actual data. Easier make thoughts logic needing someone else tell think. hard find since everyone baking bread- went month half without seeing stores *"" order requires farm operator isolate workers prohibits working notice. ""*

I see mention workers compensated. hope ""overlooked"". According article:  restaurants forced revert delivery takeout model 
 

So closing effect servers likely convert deliveries. 
Local restaurants near closed used servers delivery drivers. So, make work sure profitable would be. Contact tracers places like New York Minnesota literally prohibited asking people participated protests, say one way another protests cause spike. I'd throw military there. Pretty important keep guys healthy right now, especially things *really* go south.  Absolutely not. think are? American? H1N1 originated Mexico. 16 deaths population 291k gives 55 deaths per million people 1/9th rate France?

And shit deal with... old job collaborated tribal leaders lot actually give fuck keeping people safe. Can't say lot leaders... shit, obviously could care less wait weeks tell wait two weeks. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* felt way discovered sunglasses. Great little emotional bubble. know, live outside US. much fewer cases country although rising again. Things change, though. doesn’t matter said months ago. Scientists health officials said otherwise long time now. It’s ignorance believe first thing told. adapt take new information. wants produce cars meet orders. Selfish prick. Old people disabled count actual people. Advanced societies like vikings would put ice flow let Odin decide fate, kinda like many US states right now.  best beautiful idea evvaaah. simply best suited wipe asses.

Speaking barbaric, *wipe* ass bidet 😂 good dude. signed document stating May 31 month since one said planning come back work pandemic going press sh*ting Tesla also company probably needs employees want positions filled people want go work 
anyhow current California COVID-19 Workers Protections, employers wrongfully terminate workers choose work fear infection risk heavy fines workers sue Tesla think case Congrats sex hope Vaxart pushes something. specialize oral vaccines.  I’ve raging boners, idk you. wouldnt worry came back negative likely seasonal cold allergy related issues 

Maintain social distancing don’t attend social gatherings another two weeks make sure ok 👍 Yeah. really promising.

But I'm saying made dick fall 9 months later, we'd probably still finish stockpile.

Bayer great example this. caught pushing blood products contaminated HIV. Bayer knew decided keep making could. Meanwhile, knew soon would get politely asked stop developed safer alternative.

So, Bayer continued give HIV Americans knowingly despite safer product profitability.

When caught, US politely asked stop. Bayer continued manufacture sell HIV infected products less regulated markets POTUS already pushed unsafe meds treat COVID-19.

I'm saying Remdesivir bad. lot promising studies come support it.

I'm saying even bad, we'd still peddle it. Especially purchasing stock. 60% mortality rate. Whoa, good thing difficult person person transmission take place, far... It’s also statement almost impossible prove - one dumb enough admit trying slow testing. Way many humans basically idiots. I'm truly sorry restaurant grocery store workers (and many others) unnecessarrily exposed serious health threat due irresponsible customers. 

Most people need work. put along ""regular"" challenges job. governor's slow-walk lockdowns now. Newsom saying ""everyone, back inside, let's try again"". 

Now time prepare- july spent home. It’s not. deaths yesterday fewest Tuesday since March. Oh stahhhhhhp :P area job must pay $4000/month then. long run fortunate you.

A lot people lost jobs service industry, making $2000/month. really, educated people know mostly Wrong. start looking data per location basis. forgot mortality rate less flu big deal!!! hoax r/cheapimitations occurring ages 18 25 essentially continued process brain development started puberty. you’re 18, you’re roughly halfway entire stage development. prefrontal cortex doesn’t nearly functional capacity age 18 25.  means people may major struggles impulsive decisions planning behavior reach goal.** brain’s reward system tends reach high level activation puberty, gradually drifts back normal activation person reaches roughly age 25. Adults age 25 tend feel less sensitive influence peer pressure much easier time handling it.

 

Since established science time, would assume Ivy League educated leaders University faculty would know well. Yeah really need learn stop engaging trolls argue bad faith googled phrase quoted, second idea source, care to, looks like reported, track info came from. I’m confused CDC says 35,000 new cases data from? also abnormally high amount pneumonia cases, totally unrelated. pinky promise. fact America let handling global pandemic likes seen century, even become politicized issue all. baffles most. I’m American living here. understand let happen.... oh right, certain party much power hates science.... geez, where’s Doctor flying Tardis fix timeline need him?? Yes, yes: I've discussion million times. basic/general information, ongoing date information like press conferences, etc. Norway also fwiw. 

The Nordics LOT *more* information various languages. actually anywhere says works? driving NY week FL. lease soon need move. yet see supposed stay enforced. find place live (I cannot find shit online), still drive back FL, pack truck, drive back up. sit friend's apartment two weeks? provide place? can't find info? think protests spread virus much many activities did. 

It looks like high percentage people wearing masks well outside (where droplets carried away wind) really reduce transmission rates. 

A lot spread household spread one person gets brings home. lot cases people going bars, parties, karaoke etc. 

The virus likes crowded, indoor spaces re-circulated air spread around people take precautions. That's honestly believed transmission high women first victims covid husband sons die ! /s preparing anymore, activated yesterday median 5 days, 14 max symptoms. Also 3 weeks. Bar race Lose weight.   Wait Assuming Government officials care witchcraft thing call ""math."" University Alabama

Says ""school"", even call one...

Alabama, never fail entertain America world stupid retarded population. Keep up. Trump administration definitely investigate CDC. We're dictatorship bureaucracies operate independently White House. CDC:

* Rejected WHO's test insisted creating (flawed) test
* Failed properly screen travelers February March (and continues today)
* Failed properly track infections mortalities March April

I hate Donald Trump -- I'm leftist -- obvious something *deeply wrong* Atlanta heads roll there. wife tested morning drive-in testing facility Illinois. told get results 4-7 days. still norm? Seems like really long wait. Good love everyone busy hating US overly scared virus.

99.4% survives.

Meanwhile china lied virus annexing Hong Kong.

I like Americans. f shady stuff. Trumps entire platform always economy. Losing nothing. Excuses wont keep voters. INSECTS O_o

(this real thing, hope) can't tell, probably means natives. look bright side, rip mask you’re public, scream, “I can’t breathe thing!” start yelling berating nearest barista grocery clerk like true American. know I’ve theorized too! sight mask rubs wrong way. reality it’s helping them, helping me. 
I scared come work Monday wasn’t sure inviting bullying/harassment. people ones coughed back March started talking COVID, point REALLY thought joke; flu, precise. 

And something Monday normal. crowded around desk talk/eat breakfast, isn’t normal thing them, especially since virus. think challenge, wanted say something.

It’s six people though, anything say usually mocked away ignored. sanitized area left.  absolutely rationing care average day hospital covid.

If closed overwhelmed already would’ve beyond fucked months ago. lowered expectations low turned anticipating they'll stuff like keep surprising creativity. Yup.

I think time collectively acknowledge individual risk assessments failed experiment adjust plans accordingly. Worked pretty well northeastern states basically made mandate go anywhere public. 

And look states now. States like NY NJ CT etc. much better shape 

Of course spread northeast prominently earlier compared states. could’ve learned states hey maybe wearing masks actually work help flatten curve say he’s god wrestling world pretty much is, especially right now. past could tell shove could go another wrestling promotion make money either states abroad. really can’t hardly shows promoters money haven’t able run shows past months. Pretty obvious isnt it?
But try working hospital cotton face mask lol. dead month. Politics runaway cancer, it’s crazy Could worse. seen signs Trump 2020. hurts. I’m Vegas it’s bad here. Bad Texas. Really bad back family lives California. Nearly 100,00 new cases, 10,000+ new people hospitalized 1000 deaths US last 48 HOURS ALONE!!!!!! people act like back normal mask sometimes... new piece random good news

They’re wrong. condition claim, they’re definitely wrong. Look shut even whiff corona. they're open mean go. We're beach trip later month - we're literally going going hotel room beach eating takeout.

Seriously, thing would stop strong leadership, enforces things like face masks. Instead get leader literally tells followers people wearing face mask protest him. wonder 30% Americans opposed face masks. studies I've seen show masks effective stopping spreading, much catching they're really effective everyone wears one. can't say someone follow rules rules require everyone follow effective. That's like saying someone got hit dunk driver fault also. personal choice something slightly inconvenient face mask. Nice catch posting gap.

This get. engage transparently abusive behavior tends make others curious. exact opposite effect intend to.

Failing business already minimal personal consequences, ask president! mask mandates state sit-down restaurant wear mask enter, may remove mask seated table. get reason go roaming, must remask. also must remask leave. You, rest reddit, apparently ignorant important distinction. Florida's data collection great, presentation data dashboard bad. important separate two. 

What said accurate - Florida's data among best country. 

It also odd people trashing Florida's response boner Cuomo, whose terrible response cost thousands lives. Florida's deaths still flat, we've lost fraction people New York Nurses techs acting like incapable getting sick. truly insane. testing surgical patients more, person greeting patients waiting room exposed (masks supposed worn hit miss whether worn correctly not). Admin baffled elderly volunteers want come in. Probably even half people wearing helps lot.

I wore mask first time today non-mandatory place. Mandatory masks would help making feel comfortable wearing one President leads example case, bad example. talking china.

I assure bidet coronafree.  Wow, imagine bad vaccine refusal France considering anti-vax movement much Love this, hit em pocket book. It’s language people speak country wife karen. Again, false dichotomy. Lots issues require compromise, however mean EVERYTHING does. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, burglar enters home surprise, standing gun telling leave. But, insist must compromise ""everything life"" compromise ""both sides."" obviously going compromise person (ever heard rule ""don't negotiate terrorists""?) claim possesions. compromise situation objectively right objectively wrong. get voice. get seat negotiating table. 

You accuse saying NEVER compromise, I'm simply saying SOMETIMES compromise option. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, nice rule live by. Compromise good! hard fast solution world's problems. Testing virus (which capable actually put money man-power action, btw) pandemic essential public health service. ""other side"" worthy negotiation here. numbers similar breast cancer though. put perspective, would fair say coronavirus kill many people breast cancer year. Mathematically speaking. agree mathematics? understand don’t understand leap. that’s OK. kill people breast cancer, numbers. That’s scary. agree math? protests impact case volume, reasonable restrictions think of? Yeah, Godzilla normally good reason whatever he's doing. offered testing solely people attended protests. tested ~17,600 people got 2.5% positivity rate. rolling average state right around 2% time. 

If consider need “potential exposure” tested normally, would make sense people took advantage opportunity tested asymptomatic people tested positive wouldn’t otherwise tested. Basically, 20% people asymptomatic numbers align perfectly protests cause virus spread normal people everyday things. owned China. fact thing one, Smithfield. JBS Brazilian pretty much everything else U.S. owned. Based everything seen know, personal belief could walking right worst disaster world seen yet virus Texas. can’t help think hundreds videos Wuhan early on... imagining Houston many cities Texas backdrop.

One explosion cases happens, inching closer, it’s beyond comprehension...

This could avoided.

I get shutting Texas “a last resort” someone shall name here... aren’t pretty much point 102% ICU capacity truly zero end sight rapidly increasing numbers... quickly running test kits?

Iirc they're already manufacturing vaccine US supposed 300 million doses ready October. affect logistics rolling idk googled ""coronavirus transmission indoors vs outdoors"" results concurred OP article. However none specifically mentioned densely populated protests. Although many written pre-protest, everybody social distancing May.

Seems like ""stay inside"" argument completely debunked. admire optimism friend fine. Hospitals need high ICU capacity make money, doctors clearly letting people get sick die get medicare $$$$, old people really count people, numbers false anyhow bc know conspiracy, etc.

Yup I'd say 2 weeks we'll see record breaking number deaths end year. Sucks rojo states gonna rojo state /\_-o-\_/ think answered question Guess wildly unpopular world leaders supporters older less healthy team ... That's true, makes 5.8% GDP large part made lot Kiwis going domestic rather international holidays. would argue old millennials closer Gen X sociologists admit. feel like real divider generations one majority individuals iPhone (or smart phone) first phone.
I’m old millennial college Facebook became thing. university email address, past privacy controls we, idiotically, didn’t think anything it. Spotify took White Buffalo Jason Isbell, nice path. TWB’s album “Shadows, Greys, Evil Ways” pretty fantastic concept album young couple, war, PTSD. That’s album Whistler from. 

If haven’t done album start finish, STRONGLY recommend it. 

Also, nice list! unlike adults Littles testing positive hospitalized 2% rate. (155 divided 7,197) Yes, get higher quality disposable masks washable cloth masks machines. give basic disposable paper ones free stations. estimated mean duration onset symptoms death 17.8 see can't both. go out, kids (especially high school aged kids) FAR less likely even masks people, time, old people seem allergic wearing masks properly. many think breathe chins. that's nothing say rest people see, half make effort even social distance. Either way, news story one doctor's statement. pretty clear that. I'd hardly say media pushing false narrative. No, it’s pretty darn close zero. sure. rushed untested i’d 100% understand skepticism, far seems like they’re checking every box i’ll pretty confident time it’s available. Halifax Vancouver would perfect opinion staying far away possible U.S smartest move actually finishing hockey year. Everyone stopped caring. 

When I’m Baton Rouge grocery shopping, less 50% people seem wearing masks places like Walmart.

I went Lafayette single person gelato store mask even though weren’t eating waiting order playing board games exception employees. 

I’m seeing former coworkers classmates go weddings baby showers without second thought. One classmates wedding Texas least 100 people 3 classmates there. mask. 4 people went baby showers least 10 people, masks. 

Many husband’s classmates taken beach trips to
Florida. And, bachelor/bachelorette trips 6-8 people masks. They’re going bars stuff. It’s easy see spreading.

Edit:

To add this, husband’s dental class already one person test 3 times corona 3 week period experiencing symptoms finally tested positive day test. Test 1 day negative, test two results yet longer processing time.

He’s since experienced symptoms. least 3 people class tested positive earlier months. 

His best friend fever. Tested negative hasn’t gone retest despite classmate’s experience. 

Everyone idiot. Sound like they're insurance fraud. Thanks work 8 hour days shit piss? try things company time, lol. said works 20 hour days, every day. Still, runs like 5 companies sleeps 4 hours night average, doubt far truth, he's least thinking work majority waking time. clarify, disavow Musk's claims Covid19 overstated hype - that's actually irresponsible say he's looked public leader. However sympathize POV, knowing virtually every automotive startup gone bankrupt, he's bet entire fortune worked bone, risk workers low largely automated factory. Also arbitrary overly punitive considering bullshit ""essential services"" permitted stay open including job. closed 6 weeks surely cost billions dollars.. kind losses could easily bankrupt him. Keep mind he's forefront permanent pandemic solution, colonizing planets, nobody else realistically pushing showed up. flawed human whole he's extremely positive effect humanity. linked articles Texas. CA counties, MI, MD 50 countries linked majority outbreaks bars church services. 

Just TX failing doesn’t mean instances successful contact tracing don’t count.

I recommend check contact tracing data Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea Singapore. countries led quite successful contact tracing programs data quite enlightening. 95% cases linked indoor activities.

Remember US isnt country producing data virus, fact many countries better job tracking spread. Even positive, doctor likely tell quarantine rest home difficulty breathing. worry unless becomes mild cold. this, elect brown man last name ""Garcia"". ""vulnerable populations"" i.e. old people money. actual vulnerable populations (old people, immunocompromised). 

Basically worst boomers existence first biggest money maker hospitals elective surgery. hospitals overflowing COVID patients, guess stops? Elective surgery. 

There incentive hospitals label every patient covid patient aren't, lose actual money maker. think trying say stories, sad are, really aren’t important. need know things like death toll, new infections, mask mandates, vaccine progress, etc. sad story feel really bad, shouldn’t news story 1 person dying clogging front page. basically fear mongering. Exactly right. story China bought PPE January February? Basically paraphrasing likes Dan Patrick, Lt. Gov Texas. Listen interview Michael Osterholm fresh air: talks lot air ventilation open air settings low risk, unless maybe right someone's face long period time. Getting reddit would start.

holy shit. look facts way:

1) it’s become political point
2) constituents don’t believe threat virus become political
3) action taken governors seem like they’re taking position side taking much action states current situation

So take consideration facts, it’s hard understand they’re doing. They’re playing political line they’re constituents don’t think they’re moving political side, waiting things get bad. things get bad, they’ll take appropriate action...maybe. 

They’re playing party politics peoples lives it’s fucking despicable. worst part people elected politicians don’t even realize it.

U.S. seen benchmark failure entirety millennium least. prime example build first world country. think underestimating lag time...even diamond princess back February covid patients sick months ended passing away. 

Covid 2-4 week progressive disease. last 2 weeks usually determine someone ends hospitalized last week determines go icu end ventilator...even ventilated patients go months pass away. 

So no, think shocking deaths still relatively low. lag time surge new cases hospitalization eventual icu/death considerably long. 

I would also mention filled hospitals icu beds hospital beds notable excess mortality rate people died home denied care. 

So honestly, give 4-6 weeks. early August mortality rate significantly higher would truly shocked well. governors loves sucking (oil)ed cocks. understand anti-mask people. putting mask putting shoes. wouldn’t want walk around Target shoes on. would disgusting. also wouldn’t allow store. mask different. health/hygiene thing. Well, doctors, scientists, medical experts, starters. know people give big science. There's saying something along like ""give people bread, give circus (as entertainment)"". long fed distracted, worst shit (or nothing all) Huh, stop supplying test kits?

Also, well put! btw one thing loved handling US, sending big medical navy ship New York. Seeing footage huge red cross arriving New York must given much hope. know even gave personal connection NY USA. wish country, Netherlands, would done bit hope giving stuff like that, instead, heaviest part lockdown felt left since groups fall receiving support all. One big red cross ship sailing Amsterdam would definitely cheered up.  
Anyway, small positive thing keep looking :)  
Good luck following months, keep head up! I’ll agree top two paragraphs, smaller countries also less resources overall. Singapore US fairly similar GDP per capita COVID cases per capita.

Singapore fewer resources overall, much denser population managed death/per million rate almost 100 times lesser US better tests per capita rate. Unfortunately guys shit situation pretty much options awful lol, say it’s better anywhere else tho country fucking stupid US handling Covid make guys look retarded. last 20 years made look retarded. highly doubt that. tested positive testing location, progressively got really bad finally went hospital. stories people dying improper use ventilators don’t say whole virus hoax.

Right, data presentation bad. Data collection good.

The good thing need rely states presentation.

What Desantis said accurate. never said kids shouldn’t go back school. need take seriously consider methods protect them. can’t believe people act like that. Trump got elected destroyed USA. Idiots like you. Arizona activated death panel treatment. bull god wall street needs eat escaped SA avoid mandatory service **South African** military that's good thing considering SA actions back main reason I'm scared getting virus. I'm young pretty healthy, know probably die, way....serious life long effects actually scare more. click bait **shit**. Come on, guys. trying Texas health officials confirmed nearly **160,000 virus cases 2,424 fatalities statewide** since start pandemic. DSHS estimates roughly 72,744 cases currently active, 84,800 individuals previously infected recovered. Italian Ministry Health recorded **more 240,500 virus cases least 34,767 subsequent deaths**. estimates roughly 15,560 people currently infected.

This ""article"" written agenda mind, upon reading bullshit, get answer. orders magnitude worse Italy Texas. You’re one asked quite frankly that’s best thing could do. hate probably right :( scientists

....... either didn’t read article you’re idiot one here. age group 40–64 years, March – May 2020, 122 deaths occurred immigrant groups likely weakly established Sweden, compared average 38.5 2016–2019, **excess mortality 220 per cent**.

 let's say true, protests blame sudden surge cases/hospitalizations. nearly four weeks daily/weekly ""protest activity"", i.e. tens thousands people huddling closely together shouting one another hours end, spread COVID-19...why still lockdown all?

 logic, thing need reopen restaurants, concerts, sporting events, beaches, parades, etc. impose half-assed mask-wearing policy roughly 60% people need ""kind of"" follow. actually agree this. I've pro-mask jump. think masks, hand-washing face-touching pretty much ever needed. Protect at-risk population let everyone carry usual, masks whole time. Mardi Gras Spring Break caused surge infections, protests didn't, masks variable, fine reopen everything.

*bodies. nurse!! know spell bodies. Data UK regarding covid-19-related deaths shown obvious social differences cannot explained underlying diseases risk factors [1]. therefore likely significant part differences describe Sweden also expression social inequality. material conditions avoiding infected isolating infected differ significantly different groups society [4]. disease cluster may also occurred less chance infection early stage extensive spread event many individuals born particular country present. happened probably explained combination different causes. 

It obvious poorly established immigrant groups disproportionately hit, among middle-aged older people. give perspective means, death toll level, affected population whole, would amount 4,000 extra deaths 40-64 age group 40,000 among 65.

Although segregation pronounced parts Swedish society, watertight bulkheads. Specifically, spread infection elderly care could represent precisely interaction segregation society large. hypothesis infection gone circles, service profession care work, well work commuting housing, promote spread infection (Figure 1). proportion people working nurses nursing assistants Stockholm's million program areas high (Figure 3). working environment elderly care able prevent spread infection. Several different problems, lack access protective equipment, difficult organizational conditions many hours work high staff rotation, insufficient knowledge ability work according basic hygiene routines complex care environments probably exacerbated situation. 

What lessons draw reported results continued work covid-19? covid-19 different, basic answer.

There need customized information, language, form content [5]. importantly, different conditions prevailing population taken account analyzes formulation strategies. 

The results also illustrate, opinion, current management - accept certain circulation sars-cov-2 society, attempts isolate particularly sensitive groups - worked absence infection detection realistic opportunities isolation infected local communities provide care community service extent. Inequality exclusion also affect society whole times crisis.

But mechanisms virus spread understood, thus also limited. Infection tracking along meaningful information limit risk infections congestion reduce spread infection exposed areas. Infection tracking prerequisite person infected able receive infectious carrier money compensation loss income thus opportunity stay home work. Property owners need involved increase cleaning spaces shared many (for example, laundry rooms elevators) surfaces many take (handles, lamp buttons, elevator buttons, handrails more). also important dimension public transport adequately, commuting distances suburban areas question often relatively long, many depend entirely public transport work journeys.

However, understanding spread infection afterwards different matter understanding real time. this, well-thought-out strategies needed, testing infection detection individual level, also testing strategies population level. important able continuously use register data combined statistical methods automated detection clusters increased rate infection spread [6]. 

As important testing specific occupational groups, initiated throughout country, reliable population surveys geographically defined areas. get clarity higher seroprevalence continued low seroprevalence. Offering completely antibody testing actively demanding this, is, already resource-intensive, provide desired knowledge. Instead, active targeted population surveys needed, combined targeted communications inmates measures collaboration affected, specific occupational groups well residential areas population groups.

Much suffering wrought COVID-19 played cannot see: closed hospital units.

With unprecedented access, award-winning filmmaker Sasha Joelle Achilli goes inside hospital coronavirus crisis northern Italy, capturing unforgettable look harrowing, heroic fight doctors nurses waging disease. fucking shit Nope, SFASU global elites get fill \*quickly.\*

And interests get workers back work, consumers spending. another example thinking box someone clearly fucking tree work live major vacation resort. 


God help us. not? already goes news say fake news anyway.

Although... mayors, sheriffs, whoever else says ""refuse enforce"" mask MANDATES, would actually like borrow line Trump say ""You're fired!"". wearing masks public, pandemic, declared emergency reckless endangerment public. Meat realistic according Federal Institute Risk Assessment (BfR). probable reason cold, humid workplace air conditioning spreads virus connection close working close living conditions. Pfffft young adults? work two 50'somethings took spent time hot spots drove back. see covid nothing sniffles. Since virus can't target infecting people refuse use critical thinking, next best thing. Unfortunately ton collateral damage done willfully ignorant. choosing ignore perfect people. lie, trying be. umm smile ok tho. call gummy. sun fries brain..

Love AZ people really live fantasy world sometimes. “The second wave” state state, states experiencing first wave others past it. small business owners struggling right now? educator, district using go forward reopening next month. Frightening. tradition healthcare, education, COVID, foreigners roast US behind times Massachusetts take it.

We to. New England rest Northeast secede. tell Trump means family rule red-states perpetuity. like Kims North Korea. education, social welfare policies, private healthcare? feel like seen headline least 2-3 times 😓 understand article all. Maybe poorly written completely missed something. 122k deaths pretty much exactly officially recorded. Actually little lower. claims ""real"" death count much higher ""official"" one? saying 122k addition excess deaths know COVID-caused? so, author needs start again. already good amount research done vaccines COVID's. They're starting scratch. starting look smaller alternative space reason. think they're trying find bunch separated small offices people can't work home idea they're going lease, furnish configure/network space quickly, especially space likely short term lease. month ago, likely accurate anymore Doesn’t mean humidity doesn’t help! Suck dick Honestly mean would good PM though. shit average Canadians, make us poorer. big business. Absolute best case, wide availability summer-fall next year vaccine. Fall/Spring testing/proving protects healthcare workers. gonna take immunize everyone too. reporting vaccine going, it’s tested fully safe,
They going come say ‘lol sorry guys give us year make needles’ Look difference ifr cfr fucking way! know that. Simpsons predicted point anywhere could hotspot lockdown. right?

I said supported right protest, seems disingenuous. enjoy! fyi, pew foundation fundamentally unbiased makes profit/has incentive report one viewpoint another. amazing effort must take willfully ignorant literal facts! :) terrrrrible headline. pandemic still killing people quite time, even totally 'under control' test trace implemented, etc.  


The basic idea ""Is good idea concerts pandemic seems exploding"" pretty sound, headline makes seem like we're holding ludicrous standard 'all life stops literally one coronavirus'. often think people protesting shutdown mostly reacting worst/misinformed takes 'pro shutdown' side actual policies advocated health professionals. damn dude real dumb huh protests going month spike, nice try. Elective surgeries big money maker Censorship isn’t always glaringly obvious. Media often cast certain events bc deemed important good press. Plenty social media sites power delete remove comment/post/user masses able see input. Reddit also puts controversial downvoted posts bottom don’t receive discussion debate. Even downvote system deceptive simple is. would take strong leadership able tell people stay fuck home Independence day days. would take even stronger one stick enforce people still gonna fuck want.

Serology testing info fourth tab. hate tone response much. He’s actually medical doctor. terrifying that? Covid put conditon. weight did. can't see that, delusional. someone used told I’m “vaccine damaged” I’ll take it, counter people say vaccines made I’ve done lot research side effects vaccines actually risks vaccine outweighed benefits IMO. Happy cake day Source? bad health safety practices management, cold indoor working conditions, close-working, workers pressure come work even unwell, poorer workforce living crowded homes.

Also:

- air conditioning: Germany hired expert take look factory found important part puzzle air conditioning system re-circulated cold air factory without filtering 
- intensive physical work: makes breathing masks uncomfortable 
- loud environment: many workers wear hearing protection, probably quite loud shout want communicate 
- video tightly packed factory canteen, even lunch breaks social distancing mask usage
- things already mentioned. Cold indoor environment, crowded worker homes, sick leave rent (already way high) increased 10 Euro per day show work = strong incentives come work even sick. on. people.

its* people, apostrophe (sorry) It’s October. mom quite bad live together gets infected get infected. positivity rate todays batch tests 28.32% average last week 24.03%

I simply cannot get head around this. truly insane. means still testing people bad symptoms, still getting shocking numbers.

Godspeed Arizona. heart goes you. Good. deserve it.  may used seeing sick people certain percentage dying, they're used seeing volume COVID-19 causing. like worked checkout Walmart, one week every day like Black Friday. probably pretty tired stressed end week. that's far cry stress working ER. I’m not, COVID is. It’s virus doesn’t care reasons are. it’s likely protesters, family’s safety haircut, kill people hope save year. That’s brutal truth it.

As mentioned someone else, putting life risk OK that, fine. However, protesters putting lot people risk giving choice. know seatbelt work 100% time either.

Makeshift masks meant perfect, effective public health measure.

First, two directions every transmission, every chain infection. Outward inward. Inward protection hard. Front line health workers need N95 respirators, face shields, disposable gowns, etc. *because* engaged procedures produce contaminated droplets aerosols.

When go grocery store though, face different threat model. Depending are, good chance no-one interact even infected. case trying minimize outbreak. 

Assuming presymptomatic seed case enter grocery store, browsed fruits veggies, looked labels cans, etc. *amount* contamination *area* contamination *reduced* wearing mask, even makeshift mask.

Research data evolving rapidly, pretty clear consensus seems emerging enough people wear even partially effective face coverings, enough effect get ""r"" value (reproductive rate) COVID-19 1 fairly easily. r value 1 avoid exponential growth disease eventually eliminated. 

This Outward protection, stopping carrier shushing first place, much easier. 

On mobile, supply sources anyone cares. mention over, enormous reduction productivity people 'recovered' suffer life long term conditions, everyone else suffers decrease morale hell happened.   idea means. whaaaat? bit like Australia ATM. One state started increasing numbers whole country trending down. shows easy thing spread. live IL this. also high case count brought down. frustrating look states reduce large infection spread keep numbers low fucked up. really difficult social distance wear masks. Y'all go ahead look renters law Texas. Shit fucked up. Texas Landlord favorable state. Hell, Judges give 2 shits reality current state affairs! law law. much person situation similar myself. paid rent, 1200 ahead one month. I've used savings. Unemployment start untill next week. go. I'm sure hell living rent free anywhere regardless ""assurances"" government makes. do? I've asked question yet receive answer except 🤷 Ah yes, country currently running concentration camps citizens, forcibly sterilizing women, arrested doctor initially spoke COVID. assume would also trust Hitler. trustworthy. get it; US bad never anything right. sad uneducated world view have. Gonna funny hockey haters NHL runs smoothly actual coherent oversight (at least hope please god) Canada NBA becomes total shitshow Florida wouldn't. There's good read Forbes vaccine prevent infection honestly, Oxford vaccine feels bit snake-oily. *sigh* Making glass isn’t issue; it’s making medical grade syringes full regents solutions vaccine. Producing needle much easier producing complete vaccine inside syringe. yeah, somehow make world’s fastest vaccine despite knowing virus even operates treat it.

You people delusional; wear mask, stay home, wait long haul. deus machina coming save really know, bit probably Can't one without other. common sense Im sorry it. still don’t test results Saturday dad getting sick. don’t think took seriously probably it. probably $20 Canada. make wild claims like this.

What wild claims? Good grief. tried talking sense mother? surprised see Goop demographic “Studies Report Rapid Loss COVID-19 Antibodies”

The results, preliminary, suggest survivors SARS-CoV-2 infection may susceptible reinfection within weeks months.
Source: reports highlight need develop strong vaccines, immunity develops naturally infection suboptimal short-lived people,” Akiko Iwasaki, viral immunologist Yale University involved either study, tells New York Times. “We cannot rely natural infection achieve herd immunity.”” see churches aren’t mentioned completely right, I'm afraid absolutely made claim originally undergrad law degree. came back added “minor” later. also pursued cyber stalking sexual cyber EVERYTHING contributes, that. virus take chance spread. think want shoulder muscles Yes. government already pays health providers massive amounts money give free flu vaccines, often left lot tho drinking sense personal space distancing diminished, positive bars driving new surges, ready yet money coming from? can't ways. People work get taxed. tax goes government disperses back people. Want government spend more? Raise taxes. pay that? people working people unemployment. Now, bet thinking tax rich, tax businesses? Well tax people. unfortunate truth need realize tax business pass tax onto either employees customers. Well rich people? Name one rich person businesses. right. Let's go ahead give unemployment more, give Frontline workers work... time

But soon money handing out, causes taxes go up. Remember like taxes? rich business owners? defer taxes raising prices. Boom. gets pay extra taxes? people gave money plus middle class citizens even get money. beauty price hikes money worth less before. Worth less. Worthless. also managed hike taxes pay all. paying money worth less, get make less. 

How fix it? opinion actually Value Added Tax (Yes Andrew Yang's favorite VAT). pick items tax need live. new TV bought? Taxed. luxury car? Taxed. toilet paper? taxed. beauty raise tax items need survive. might probably would create higher prices items buying stuff? wealthy least people scrapping live. also gives incentive save instead buying second third TV. 

Now might saying yourself. guy prove point? help everyone. Well right. theory that. reality still need choose important us include giving someone used maje 10 dollars hour work 15 dollars hour stay home. gives 10 dollars hour stay home, maximum, takes extra 5 gives people need. grocery store clerk, Stockboy, gas station attendant, hospital techs get piece people may still struggling also harms way make life work. comes much money give choose. help? Judging fact downvoted, I'm going say they'd rather play ignorance. massive difference everyone access healthcare, regardless social level employment, select people access particular level healthcare. one perfect guy: Texas' lieutenant governor suggests grandparents willing die US economy Selfish set ways. *entire life* society basically catered every whim. entitled generation ever.

I'm Atheist would fight back thinking cursed husband *died day wedding*. Preventive measures seldom get credit, work there's bad outcome. people go, ""There's bad outcome, need preventive measure!"" fail understand there's bad outcome ***because of*** preventive measure. Damn that's rough. feeling better now? someone lives city TX, works service industry, lives high risk individuals, going back work option me. work available, even get job able make living wage tips open 50%. could potentially get family sick. 3 month old daughter could get sick live permanent organ damage would fault didnt get choose whether exposed. afford lifelong medical bills case, even make enough afford child care would never want risk sending daycare way things currently. Maybe things perfect live, case remainder world, US even. People like cannot see past scope little lives spiraling control US despite warnings ample time crack slowing spread containing massive outbreak. heart breaking. one thing learned people care, enough learn others mistakes. take fighting lives admit wrong. applies hundreds millions people. Umm...yes. same. would take five years pass guess beginning mortality numbers skyrocketing... really hope people need /s one.. harder breathe ventilator. also really hard breath get hospital bill good medical coverage, learn gave someone love.

Just saying... even help times...¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Flight bans banned foreign nationals still allowed thousands citizens infected countries without quarantine useless. articles explaining I'm talking about. another thread posted refer several scientific ones thread that's want.

Thank you. context make statement powerful. worth anything compared Tesla shares make sense risk Tesla trying save solar city 3 kids school, say taught school. also good memory school years 3rd grade on, even never taught ""America greatest country World"". matter fact distinctly remember sophomore history teacher (one favorite teachers ever) distinctly painting founding fathers rather negative light. gloss cruelties enacted Native Americans, kind came things like slavery misstreatment people color women throughout history. go amazing school even, standard run mill public shool. 

Maybe different south, know since I've never lived there, midwest least teach kids live greatest country Earth. type insane patriotism taught home, certain parents. parents never anti-American, also top ""patriots"" either, grew bit objective view. also make sure pass knowledge kids. proud freedom thankful also know freedom won, founders country truly heinous things. /s? It’s making billions humans, Americans. forget rest world might want this? fuck Irish always get through? Hmm... heard ""slavery""? Bars restaurants closing people refuse wear masks.

You cant eat drink mask on! Thats issue here. 

Also 50% 25% thing thats 50% maximum occupancy. restaurant normally seats 50 people max occupancy 75, means still 37. 50% used do, 50% max. Also restaurants never full anyways outside Friday/Saturday. definitely close businesses, unless eat, sleep work gym trapped inside. gym owner totally get frustration, someone goes, able find another solution end world. This. brother it, really sick 6 weeks. wife 2 kids, stayed house him, never got sick. 

Oh brother, who’s overweight smokes around 40 cigs day, perfectly fine again, able run etc. complications ilness. way attract workers 🤔. Oh well... probably need put signs 🤷🏻‍♂️ 4th July slammin beers shootin guns I'm sick people country (Costa Rica) complaining 'lockdown' did. even fully blown lockdown, need wear mask public vehicular restrictions nation-wide (it used center city only).

They say response overblown economy suffering necessary. 16 deaths country something trying protect us.

I seen people sharing post last year 80+ deaths respiratory illnesses. think fair compare flu cases restrictions COVID cases lot restrictions???? get started people claiming political hoax.

People blaming Nicaragua 32% cases 'foreign' (they even tell nationalities), IMPOSSIBLE stop crossing border illegaly. 

We already biggest police operation history patrolling border, enough tons rough landscape jungle zone.

They say deport them, what's going stop crossing again? accept Nicaragua catastrophe right now, best isolate them.

Oh yeah, blame Nicaraguans, blame amount idiots caught police mass gatherings parties last weeks.

They blame goverment expanding ICU capabilities, fail realize ICU bed.

They blame goverment 0.004% population died, fail see strict measure goverment took.

The blame second wave population obey, goverment foreigners  Holy shit, lot experts Indian culture here. That's bullshit correlation. stupid. ""Oops."" Bars, lived WI tell people bar anywhere else Given Tweets account self-promoting terrible website, I’m gonna guess they’re talking ass. main reason Florida hot spot beaches

(citation needed)  talking death. talking long term complications. Clots, strokes, lung damage, lung transplants, dementia.

There's already people awaiting lung transplants post covid. early reports likely get worse see larger larger numbers infected worldwide. love talk wearing masks anti science talking mortality rates (under 35s chance dying car crash) totally ignored. 

Let young people shield vulnerable. don’t want go out. Don’t. insane think vaccine coming year. Never vaccine made less 5 years human history Great I'm excited. Miracles happen. can't change time though. Yet. bought first Ford 3 months ago, (needed B car work home live city) Taurus, 1700 bucks runs like sewing machine repair maintenance compared old Infiniti staggering cheaper car keep.

Everyday turn key look emblam though, im like ugh fuckin guy, hell car though.

Everyone lives glass house couple mind Tweets okay...I mean stressful year kid way...but dug reckless actions. Samsung make electric car... go back lifestyle made gain weight first place. see dieting temporary change lose weight wonder gaining back. keep every day life. I've done it, I've lost almost 40kg (90 pounds) years ago gained anything back since. keep living like losing weight, needed lifestyle change, diet. I've climbed mountain put thousands hours online games, adrenaline rush equal. knock try it.  understand mental gymnastics throwing fit take away someone's source income wanted hamburger breakfast. People really pieces shit. would unusual tests held due lack processing materials, bottom line Florida can't keep testing demand.

* Supplies perform tests running low.
* Supplies process tests labs running low.



Don't get wrong. Probably tom foolery going numbers decisions made. However, Florida prepared type surges across entire state point fingers lot decisions root cause.

Screaming ""Muh rights!"" claiming face masks dangerous, crowding public spaces, bitching bars gyms pools closed, screaming pandemic fake news worse flu anyone who's afraid little flu snowflake, mostly. IFR c19 0.26%.

Which obviously incorrect. even POSSIBLE. NYC Lombardy higher percentage ENTIRE populations die form COVID already. 

Even every single man, woman, child areas already caught virus, IFR STILL higher that, based deaths they've already had.  Reporting what’s happening panic. You’re simply choosing interpret way give argument it. Widespread demand healthcare cost reform happened started seeing people plead GoFundMe pay bills, people kind accepted it. Donation jars local cancer patients gas station something accept. ffs even hypothetical, Arizona's ICUs full *right now* they're make decisions gets live doesn't, fucking sucks there's plenty people simply make cut ""lived long enough"" 60 70.  Cause is. literally EVERY benchmark. It’s two steps away failed state. wait see. America’s gonna obsolete 20 years. governor wait way late it.

That past already. wonder neighbor kicked ass Ah sorry. forgot gulf breeze hospital. Also, full service. go Pensacola larger hospitals lot. Whoa whoa whoa let's hasty master meriadoc. states ~~might worth booting~~might want leave too, even consider them?   Work slow down. need both. Totally agree keeping nursing homes central valuable strategy.

Disagree flu season comment- least, think misleading. Many die flu also elderly. 72k ppl aren’t nursing homes dying would different thing flu season...  US-“you gotta pump numbers up. rookie numbers.” Pretty rare. work healthcare billing every organization setup catch these. got ER charges charge test actually performed likely slipped cracks. Again, spend 10 times much marketing vs research?

You're dying hill money gone research. chunk $2500 goes marketing?

And again, would feel like weird national pride thing favor one greedy seedy entities planet earth like US pharma

Where concept ""we"" come from

Try stay track time, ask pictures need  *""If beliefs stupid racist.""*  Frig Ricky! Oh says we're fucked nothing point continue hunker down. 50% \*patients\*, 50% cases. 50% people hospitalized. live Calgary talk scared could happen ""mask people"" masks ""are sheeple"". 

Guess see cities follow people respond it. ""The US always right thing, every wrong thing first."" species deserves eradication. saw guy back Stop &amp; Shop standing eggs, drinking iced coffee mask around chin. channeled Karen energy, glared called asshole passed. Waiting almost week seems crazy me. estimated 1.5-3 days here. ended taking less 24 hours. shocked. went Sunday! 

Hope brother law alright!

(I tested negative, I’m going get tested asthma. It’s ride haha.) Florida hospital ICU free capacity 26% last week 22% today, don’t know baseline 3 weeks ago 6 months ago. people started tracking follow trends. Deaths flat week week higher number today.

FL officials also begin tracking overall COVID hospitalizations. 

It seems like thing younger people driving high numbers slow decrease ICU capacity likely slow increase deaths come.  mean, would sensible decision, makes believe it? Neither party openly advocated continue, taken steps ensure continuation. Tick tock. used Enron, remember? west wing amazing. watched like 5 years ago, happy waited 30s rather watching like 20, would less interested content. 

My issue newsroom based real events happened super recently, felt like way rewrite news covered certain stories. definitely enjoyed show Ya... tons people are. must heard 15 times today. guess also understand opinion, work facts area, plenty healthcare worker believe Covid-19 believe problem. USA! USA! USA! opposed religion religion? Also remember fellow Americans started hoarding toilet paper? Maybe something. Per Alabama safer home order effect 7/6: 

2. Quarantine infected persons. Effective immediately, person tested positive COVID-19—other institutionalized persons—shall quarantined place residence period 14 days, period time directed State Health Officer, designee, receiving positive test results. person quarantined pursuant provision shall leave place residence reason seek necessary medical treatment. 

****

Per Bloomberg Law:

Penalties violating quarantine laws Alabama include conviction fines $50 - $500. Penalties apply violating quarantine orders, fail provide required notice notifiable diseases, vessel masters fail perform quarantine.

Which leads this:


CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE – Code Alabama Section 13A-6-4

A person commits crime criminally negligent homicide causes death another person criminal negligence.

Under Code Alabama Section 13A-2-2, criminal negligence defined failing perceive substantial unjustifiable risk result occur circumstance exists.  The risk must nature degree failure perceive constitutes gross deviation standard care reasonable person would observe situation.  

Criminally negligent homicide Class misdemeanor sentence must 1 year county jail.



There’s also:

Iowa indoor dining “50%” two weeks protests. first week looked like 50% restaurants, bars couldn’t reopen roughly protests happening. point “50%” looked like 90% quite places.

Saw Facebook posts bars straight standing room dance club packed full drunks.

So comparison that, yeah, protests likely much contributing factor.

Oh boy... helped lot ton measures taken even restricted order. companies businesses setting 'sanitizing stations', delegating hospitals treat Covid-19 non-Covid patients sent non-Covid19 treating hospitals, closing places 1 positive case immediately disinfecting, etc. Getting 1000 housemen trained handle Covid cases numbers low really good move too.

It also helped businesses started ordering employees work home, etc. much going even MCO, hard keep track.

Feel free post link literally school US shows offer minor law. Read article see . suppress ""pathways""? it’s mandated businesses, means people would able go inside businesses without mask, would make efforts meaningless. Masks nothing, optional. 

Oklahoma’s policy “personal responsibility,” majority people think it’s responsibility wear mask, don’t. needs mandated everyone outside home wearing mask, needs consequences wearing mask. 

I say someone lives Oklahoma horrified lack response proper guidance governor, selfish behavior people can’t grasp concept wearing mask important everyone.

[Disclaimer observation youth less compliant conservative states. west northeast, I’ve heard many stories young people wrangle parents stupid shit. Yep - think things going get much worse instead better.   Back march, went purchased couple hundred dollars canned goods non-perishables, enough get three months stay-at-home.  Last night, went next three months.  little doubt another three.  Nobody hoard, really trying stay stores much possible point. left said might small embers put out. Yo, too. able get confirmed due limited testing, I've lung pains 3 months. literally can't sleep night lungs hurt. Although chest pains might pleuritis have. inflamed rib cartilage nothing worried despite sharp pains. shred? kids home school. Nevada residents: ""Nevada highest coronavirus transmission rate, pass around.."" want point out. dr monky responded one replies with, “please get corona die” like absolute class act is. I’m sure deleted came senses, think everyone know kind person is. Thank links. I'll give read little later time actually sit down. Okay. Let's assume zero Covid-19 deaths second. Now, let's go look average deaths causes US year (including January February maybe one two deaths allegedly novel coronavirus). lets look death causes year alone compare... Hmm.

So, explain excess deaths importantly, steps administration taking ensure get worse? 796 cases 3000 tests yesterday county 2 million. everything still open. Buffets open. aren’t supposed be. 0 accountability. Ironically, Florida pretty aggressive FOI / open records / “sunshine” laws. That’s it. Terminator-Gremlin-Coronavirus. Coming soon. upvote lol corrupt stock market good news? Artists putting concerts youtube this, they've fantastic. toll lags several weeks behind rise cases. 

I mean, really. People keep saying - keep lengthening supposed lag cases deaths. already 2 weeks since Texas' cases started surge seen accompanying spike deaths, remained around 30 per day.

See - [Texas 

Contrast New York (see - [New York New York's spike really started mid-March. March 16, 2000 cases. March 27, 5000. death toll lag ""several weeks"" explosion cases. April 1, 400 deaths day continuing increase. 

Texas 2000 cases June 14 recorded 21 deaths June 30. That's longer lag New York's 2000 case number 400 death count there's indication Texas death counts increasing all, forget manner would follow NY's example.

There might ways harmonize this, lag one them. articles lions dogs... sure animals tested positive yet.

Also, sure spread humans...? 

Hopefully thing, I'm sure we're looking either. Considering assuming Europe getting screwed see link shows is? seen heard word Europe shortages. casual search drug name showed link Germany. go. Tell 5 days ago drug allowed prescribed country's Europe.

So decide little things like dosage prescribe first.  

You want go lets see reputable link says country Europe shorted first. physics science also.

No, recognize science spans micro-biology astro-physics everything between. time I'll ignore everything hospitals use developed NASA scientists. casting aspersions scientists working medically relevant fields working studies medically relevant. course aspects chemistry used medicine, lot chemistry going medical field.

Joe herd goats, Joe gets sick. Joe know got sick asks Mike herd goats gets better. Mike gets sick. Joe asks Susan herd goats. Susan gets sick. 

Without finding source outbreak, people get sick. Yes goats probably die test goats find spreading virus. knew back April May virus really bad. right endanger lives everybody kill others. american way.  checked post history? 6 posts within hour negative. would say agenda. Even asked still got reply. makes sound like Danish read comments idk. federal government never team states. need show leadership.

It’s true people downplayed - everyone. People didn’t listen warnings federal government failed testing. tests would warned.  People work gyms may low chance dying, extremely high chance contracting spreading others die it. Stop thinking yourself. narcolepsy cataplexy lot friends western CT , unfortunately I've seen IG stories past week 2 makes pretty wary. hope people continue take seriously Good point They're pretty English half Spanish interview Adrian Hill - less 2 mins make feel hopeful). smallest level empathy humans much expect?

Honestly, call fetish left. masturbate guns public look chart, counties high population people color significantly cases countries low population starting early April protests. chart also shows counties low population people color also spiking. However, since initially less cases, less cases currently. eyeball analysis, growth rate cases looks concerning.

I’m saying Joe Rogan doesn’t that, show makes effort least. think Joe Rogan “intellectually lazy”, open eyes media institutions watching, like Daily Show Last Week Tonight. BTW watch enjoy well. Watching US stumble deeper disaster strange watch- reminds impotent feeling watching loved one struggle addiction mental illness- see warning signs spot self-destructive behavior powerless stop it. honestly hope heart Navajo first nation peoples stay safe epidemic. us US watching many leaders reveal true loyalty money status versus even smallest shred loyalty common people. many governors leaders willingly sit back watch even white americans perish idiocy, much failing native people? saying that. plant based diet shown improve cardiovascular health, diabetes obesity. someone eats meat 3 times day, cut day, make huge difference. also help reduce environmental pollution factory farming...the way animals kept close quarters un hygienic conditions perfect breeding ground diseases...  problem unemployment problem people paid little. read article signed document clearly stating May 31.

In April messaging cases small snapshot particularly useful. Look deaths, excess deaths particular - message. media cases, time. I'm spiking football early saying FL, AZ, TX see deaths rise, solidly third week increased cases deaths barely budged. swiss way :) glad today big spike new cases. actual data backs up... majority people rioting protesting white people know chance dying virus slim.

I’m really fan “get back work” one time payments, doesn’t solve issue next month, is, people worse work wages low.

A UBI would solution need problem. Non essential workers stay home, one disincentived making money  work bar, got called back work last week, potentially exposed covid well losing job bars getting shut back down. Stock ownership (and wealth increase higher stock market) overwhelming benefits rich.

 Goldman Sachs, stock ownership extremely concentrated growing wealth gap U.S., thus market’s performance affects households making wealthiest 1% Americans much significantly wealthiest 0.1% 1% households 17% 50% total household equities respectively, significantly 13% 39% late 80s,” 84% stocks owned U.S. households held wealthiest 10% Americans, according analysis 2016 Federal Reserve data Edward Wolff, economics professor New York University Word, I’m machines, wish better job making available months ago San Antonio hospitals same. King County actually surging right now.

They highest cases 2 months. kinda wanna get smarter people's thoughts this

You've come wrong sub, ask question r/covid19 never, ever, ever eat words. Mask reastaurant? Wut? eat lower mask lmao? Makes sense 0.26%? That's... interesting. come out? right big arms seems like got lost somewhere person's post. decision get Reddit stop listening news coronavirus resulted moving county coronavirus hot spot know. Point made people making extra 600 going back work job offered back problem. anything 2400 week anything higher. card proves per HIPPA can't ask tthe condition Also lower socioeconomic status, they’re likely “essential workers” greater exposure risks overall numbers lies.

People sub refuse believe article says Covid might less deadly data shows without completely solid proof, yet make wild claims like this.

How claim, 5 months, effects virus last forever? Spread facts, fear. like...who exactly think making money equation? university? scientists? trial participants (because oxford lying, certainly someone would knowledge)? 

What would happen believe information vaccine? generally distrust everyone? Albany indoor dining 2 weeks without spike positives tests. data shows continue reopening. point phases??

This sub pays attention data supports views. super elderly dad plans huge 4th July party, blessing attendance 50 unhealthy sister...them grandchildren extended family. can't talk it...jesus. I'm worried. Agreed. aghast someone confident it’s right course id action. I’m planning reservations think thinking person should. Hate break you... cannot even produce needles vaccine everyone within 1 1/2 years minimum. again, that’s needle telling harsh truth? US spread primarily seeded NYC evacuees, 4th coming weekend looks like 100k cases day might happening near future. People going lose jobs again, cares act expiring soon people getting evicted, people unemployment see 60 percent cut pay top that, government isn’t shit. hell takes break world wide pandemic thousands people dying day Americans struggling. It’s sad time American, feds can’t even job. Let states fend ppe well. Stupid I’m betting cause daycare. people go back work, kids need daycare services. Minorities less likely afford best services enforce small groups social distancing. Kids asymptomatic. could reason younger adults hospitalized protesting isn’t spreading. Honestly, man idiot. hope Kentucky votes out.

Maybe need start getting Americans see Congress Survivor island would vote. needs voted out. spikes attach receptors lungs may may kill you.  Yes, is. countries much worse US, yet sub fucking cares US politics. Well said profit correcting you. It’s legitimate designation. Lots non profit still generate revenue. It’s like short conversation yesterday worker Taco Bell Alabama, “These people ain’t got goddamn common sense.”

That business I’ve seen entire state closed people without masks. People realize shit may take real toll could become chronic. There's reddit group stories who've it. Many still dealing w/ symptoms 90+ days out. Chronic fatigue, SOB, blood pressure issues. mean? physical space tests what? 16% hospitalization rate (!) problem need take seriously prepare worst case scenario. Yep, it, keeping fingers toes crossed good results soon ivermectin, possibly cocktail dexamethasone. 

Absent vaccine, effective treatment that's cheap able taken home would thing let us resume normal life sooner rather later. boomer mom 100% anti mask (mask mandate county), still wants go gym, etc.

Her solution? friend make mask cheesecloth.

It provides exactly 0% protection, very, proud outsmarting mask mandate. probably aware COVID-19 fearsome, potentially lethal infectious disease yet symptom mild enough figures cold something like that.

You know zombie movies people get bitten, yet tell survivors think somehow special affected? like that. Quarantine nineteen. think one saying stay inside you, everyone puts mask safer everyone literally least people show empathy risk people choose job wellness. Oh ok. Well say so. 1.) Pretend coronavirus ain’t thang.

2.) Continue enforce serious measures cases rise.

3.) Hide numbers things get critical point.

- Cold Stone Cream Austin Yep, think Reality Prez made things clear.

1) lot people throw lot people bus (or politely look away) they’re given things like (ie, low tax rates). 
2) lot people, Adam Serwer said, cruelty point. Instead wanting make things better everyone, prefer see people don’t like (for whatever reason) suffer. they’re suffering (or even perceive they’re suffering) everyone else suffer, too. 

Obviously none stuff super revelatory, think intellectually understood pre-Reality Prez, it’s made made clear people beginning say quiet part loud guy charge. animals vectors. Dude, don’t dump exercise. Diet huge part weight control obviously, somebody working aware body health, it’s far likely lead conscious food choices.

If somebody already fat lazy, telling bother exercising they’re gonna eat badly anyway doesn’t help. step forward step right direction. Exposed. Get tested 2 negative tests return outside world agree productive.

I screenshots (now deleted) tweets Dr. Jerome Adams March support statement, ridiculous statements ""experts"", clips Dr. Fauci keeps saying masks needed way late.

But unlikely change mind, nobody else see thread, would waste time us.

Stay safe.  Great teenager, teacher told cover kidney area riding bicycle, otherwise I'll regret years later.
Did listen him? course not.
Do regret it? Almost every fucking day.
Now Covid19, struggling aftermath every day keep telling people: whatever getting it. aftermath constant walk hell. Wear masks. Avoid large gatherings. Take care yourself. get Covid19, may suffer months - time show - years. 

Did hear teacher...? really. Teaching one kid read bad. I've done son since lockdowns started. entire classroom's worth kids making sure none fall behind sounds way daunting deserving respect. that. really. whole foreign interference election thing. news everything. Yeah stayed four bedroom apartment ten girls UCLA. 2-3 girls bedroom two bathrooms still pay 900 month rent. Universities breeding ground COVID. leaders. There's lot really good leaders locally. seeing bottom barrel news stories like this. forget elected Obama decade ago twice. hell information published like 4 months pandemic?, like think it'll blow nobody wants help. America wants help. almost impossible situation **even if** everybody page curbing virus would difficult. However, everybody page America outside intervention would ineffective.

My advice Americans, stay home, wear mask, wait vaccine.  top state US HDI better top country world that, subsidizing crap states   could bad news Africa. gonna say that. Lol already party. Glad don’t live Texas remember right, actually Quebec marks cases negative test recovered.

The rest provinces mark cases recovered 14 days positive test (unless info like case still hospital). Make right call. Buden sucks he's miles ahead trump putting fire important building house wood next door. frustrating people take someone's​ word something important - one person's word!

 quick Google search tells virus lives 40-140°F. There's places, mostly SW get warm, usually worst summer heat gets hot! Definitely April spring showers still cooling things (or creating floods, both).
I will

That said, we're July temperatures rising, might able use car disinfect groceries (not frozen fresh foods obviously!). dude wanted throw grandma bus I’ve seen show, one must real peach. University administrators pushing students return campus collect fees, least state. Universities getting pushback parents, students, community members, local governments. Nice. Also, there's nothing quite like Vermont Fall!  think calzones better pizzas different opinion.

Thinking doctors know anything average Joe different opinion, wrong... People NYC taking seriously rest country. Also MTA already hands free masks… vending machine lets buy multiples. I've never heard expression love it. fucking cake, guys! folks hill sure are. 
Their behavior markedly different mixed neighborhood. 

I black friend thinks idiots neighborhood mixed large percentage White, Hispanic, Indian Chinese.

Put blinders back pretend happening. 

Look looting videos... looting? ideas? Well highlighted it, leading lot deaths economic consequences well poor leadership. really expecting college kids huge parties tailgate? 

After testing positive? Yes! expect even college students stop having/attending huge parties couple weeks know positive I'm n boat fired 2 months ago. Regular unemployment $300 even touch already frugal live style. 2 months I've yet receive anything.

My background IT. I've quite interviews always get beat out. times companies want pay beyond $12 hour. Ridiculous! Grandparents/seniors huh? Well first line volunteer, then.  I'm 37 yo obese man. wife nurse working directly covid patients. keep safe? like spending see Trump clearly treating like political rival. Probably thinks election done covid magically disappear They're United States. Seeing deaths quickly falling, think year incredibly pessimistic. Sweden went test &amp; trace strategy start, would've superstar..

Agreed. would similar outcomes Norway Finland similar population density, education level, etc. sad. lost opportunity. myopic technocrats fought wrong war (Giesecke Tegnell thought ""just flu bro"" acted accordingly) weak government solicit opinions experts (something Nordic governments did) instead let inept technocrats run country. think Sweden kinda wanted Korea Europe - keep everything open, including border instead suppressing (not eradication) virus order keep everything open, opted building immunity blew faces reputation went toilet..

Yes, agree. seem genuinely convinced they'd herd immunity April, May, June 'end summer'. Sigh. blew face. really wish Sweden could swap places Iceland geographically explosion's shrapnel getting onto neighbors. :( Hopefully work mostly condenser outside, come inspect blower, path door carpet I'm going mop area bleach they're finished Here's latest list US states counties, ranked per capita deaths: needs enforced, added rules Ireland enforcement majority dont wear masks big lecture, 100 level classes packed well. already got hit 20% salary reduction plus one week per month furlough. 
So, quite close salary halved. 
I prepared though I’ll weather storm... long don’t get axe! know number people psyched much panic actually made symptoms feel worse mistook effects panic attack Covid19, guarantee 1. Love legend map. It’s color key... names colors... even bother?  sound like smart bunny. sell short. amazing. Northeast forms coalition, locks hard, works together, educated willing citizens beating thing. Unity, woulda thunk'd. proud state. Actually, HUGE PR stunt. Inovio nearly data stock tanked Promising, positive result clinical trials good thing. Though keep mind 35 people given vaccine compared 9 people given placebo, theres still long road ahead. cannot afford wait 300,000,000+ Americans personal awakening virus. That's nice privilege flaunting there. We're getting glimpse climate crisis going play out. Illness, displacement, loss income, hit poor disproportionately. We've known while, likely policy response non-existent; private wealth provide buffer individual stay removed crises. even gone down, still behave responsibly. Stay much reduce # contacts. Wear mask keep distance public. go super spreader events. pretty simple stuff. Phase three Putin sits back laughs America implodes Trump sits tiny f\*\*\*\*\*\* hands. idea EU works, you? problem America, popularity contest, democratic ridiculous system electoral colleges. popularity contest, avoided mess.  /r/DecreasinglyEnglish correct. people Covid? Lots famous people Covid point. nobody reporting long-term effects? mean Oxford vaccine provide non-sterilizing immunity year, provide immunity. provide time permanent vaccines produced e.g. Imperial College’s  Houston decently Abbott threw hammer said “fuck local community fuck masks lets reopen” Yeah, doubted saying didnt get information trying spread bs. extrapolating beyond information knew. fine. Same! I'd rather educated guess virologist musings ex talk show host. predicted, Sweden lot trouble scaling testing apparatus. attacked “hating Sweden” making prediction, usual analysis (sadly) correct. recent instances problems testing: 

Compare Denmark troubles kind all, tests large-ish nation world. think someone wants successful college best seek out. Both.  Correct, indication quarantine 8 days contact infected person symptoms, test 8 days. Don’t link WHPM inc California, coloidal gold seems trying circularly argue subject me. such, likely disengage.

Before however, again, prove claim trying defend.

To break more:

The claim: Surgeon General, Dr, Fauci, etc., spent months unequivocally saying masks nothing people don’t need them""

What link provided (which well familiar with) shows evidence Surgeon General,~~ Dr, Fauci, ~~etc~~., ~~spent months~~ *said February* ~~unequivocally saying masks nothing and~~ people don’t need them

You see issue here, yes?

Anyways, passingly pleasant far interactions tend go. hope safe, healthy, everything need. drove testing station got nose violated like month ago free. What's happening meatpacking plants travesty since whole thing started. Tbh, recently flew (in Europe, got tested last week) required wear mask 6 hours straight. super annoying, super hot got massive headache. change wore it, get bit more, especially masks protect yourself, protect others due limiting droplets, people might think breathing nose mout much comfortable. Looks like left part study started 40 people, 3 contracted virus (presumably challenged living daily life) even getting best laid plans... bizarre told body ruined feel totally fine never cough. People shit risk analysis. people die young would say, ""that came nowhere!""

No. texting driving, Karen.

Literally everyone else knows that's risky lecture goddam daughter time thought somehow exempt. Well lots people including doctors nurses die.... :( It’s thing masks effective. spent first month conflicting reports saying masks don’t help. 

We also told people 20s-30s they’re relatively safe getting real sick possibly dying, we’re surprised went about? like well reasoned response. correct we're certainly seeing exponential growth anywhere yet saw months ago. However, looking John Hopkins website, definite noticable uptick daily infections many states starting mid June. Hopefully ever become exponential though. hospitalizations fatalities, certainly go now, hopefully like saw places. There's couple reasons hopeful:
1. summer people outside sun wind quickly disperse virus
2. people getting generally younger
3. Virus mutations usually weaken virus. 1918 Flu real outlier regard.
That said, still dangerous allow COVID spread much been. things suddenly turn worse, able act fast enough prevent bad outcome. certainly want see lockdowns again, little limit spread prevent another panic. steps taken past days governors hopefully make impact. #Translation:

One-third 3,000 self-tests covid-19 performed Halland region past two weeks failed, local media reports.

One thousand people taken test able answer symptoms sign infection - received answer ""technically incorrect"", according Halland News.

The many faulty responses believed due, among things, operating errors, also heat believed played role.

- Last Friday lab tried cool samples came - percentage errors dropped 33 20 percent immediately. still unacceptably high, clear reduction, says chief physician Anders Åkvist. Underappreciated comment. Top COVID-19 expert...??? mean top COVID-19 mouthpiece.  time tells you, we've already known month. already getting NPR/Reddit Hug Death.... Can't get dashboard load...  one batted eye every person working grocery stores deal massive waves people rushing basically pay. stock 70 percent worlds PPe played beginning stock pile ppe themselves. think?? know bars closing people intoxicated can’t stop impulses - get close get sloppy distance. 

That exactly elementary kids like. wonder constantly hounding safe get close going psyche. I’m sure kids going internalize dirty contaminated nagged germs washing hands. 

School isn’t going warm fuzzy place past. hugging, teachers going want close kids. Imagine getting caught picking nose climate? class socially distance line walking hall?

Also going back still can’t buy Lysol wipes? saying! sell dirt cheap drop overall value Tesla’s used vehicle market. buy $1,000. show them, DM email address get done teach Elon who’s really charge. side that. taking minimum wage job might buy months shit tossed street. spend time trying find job pays enough work move shit moved you. 
.

A lot low wage jobs work hard allow work jobs etc. easy lay be. Minimum wage job may keep feed. 1200 dollar mortgage clear 900 bucks month... buying much time, relieving stress life. 
.

And that's without factoring currently putting health risk. fucked get sick insurancing low pay job. AstraZeneca, manufacturers vaccine. immunity last year Robert Ford?

Crackhead former mayor robert ford? [He's Nice fact check, daily news... football coaches D1 schools actually paid tuition. They're paid ""boosters"" alumni fans pour hundreds millions dollars school's athletics departments tax write offs. 

Sometimes single whale, like T. Boone Pickens Oklahoma. schools may thousands smaller million dollar donors. UGA priority system season tickets based donations; years ago minimum donation needed get $20,000. 

But schools damn desperate football happen. *because* much money line. Forget paying coach, smaller schools football basketball revenue needed set athletics make money - like swimming diving, equestrian, track &amp; field, etc. students get scholarships athlete, even though sport makes money all. Thirdseys? Indeed.

However, one main risks covid easily saturates hospital capacity. Remsevidir help next patient, one receives it. I'm actually kinda surprised US seems buy this, choices US crisis individualistic far, guess good sign. Partly ""every man themselves"" mentality.

Why hell Norway importing Swedish healthcare workers, mention giving quarantine exemption?

Don't enough healthcare workers? think they'd have, relatively calm Corona situation there. guess that's case, particularly since need badly get quarantine exemption. mean healthcare workers last group want take without quarantine, right? 

And import *Sweden* places? Denmark Finland? Really curious choose Swedish workers alternatives. two folks spare something?

So many questions decisions. I'm security officer mask enforcement general public credit union site. got threatened cussed times insisted reassignment.

Ummm value head brain that's it, helmets seatbelts save lives that's important bit uncomfortable short period time. make light situation whole debacle south west gives us better idea much longer need shit opening right big no. 
I'm lifelong resident, even though still anxiety I'm confident back March.  Whats internet equivalent shaking keys? 

Ooo shiny, look here. adults talking. Yes great news lockdowns effectively worked bring death rate 1000 transmissions today's deaths would occurred. shame held point community spread stopped new catastrophe cause deaths skyrocket again. slightly good news new cases might eventually see ceiling, fantastic still extraordinarily high. immediately recover greater heights. isn’t real market subject market forces anymore. We’ve proven take measures whatsoever prop short medium long term. that’s choice make. people taking less personal risks vaccine. people like we’re better fighting virus Fucking anything avoid becoming ANYTHING like USA. seriously masks save lives stop spread. earth would wear them, unless don’t care others. Infections hospital staff lower NY general population helps. Pretty sure true around country. tend much stricter proper PPE adherence rest. rest world laughing America long covid sad...but 50% Anericans overweight therefore unhealthy. People need eat healthy plant based food exercise. Yeah, forgot increase Murphy factor order magnitude. Denial &amp; ignorance Madness open USA Hahaha. Agreed. I'm America work RN hospital Socal getting bad. 

We've doubled patients 3 days 24 50+ patients coming higher acuity staying longer ever.

America literally laughing stock world piss poor response Covid. Well Doug Ford Provinces Premier basically left region decide. hope follow through. one year? must drunk high. go sleep off. We're okay. Continuing subsidize Canada's defense, entertainment, technology, commerce, whole host things, everything perfect. oh boy, going fucked numbers next week! Seriously, people sensationalizing plain making inaccurate misleading titles? genuinely curious OP, aside appeal potential shock value leading interest, angle? Yes — you’re outdoors, wearing masks, keeping distance you’ll fine, matter large gathering — that’s science aerosolized droplets air. Go figure Ah yes that's feeling PTSD
Like things never right again. Constantly expecting worst Nice assumption people arrangements made.. setting filtration without respiratory training? Looking similar kind mask allows breathe when/if gym reopens. Don’t want respiratory restrictive breathing training. good air flow blocking bad stuff. Hi there. already posted taken repost. Dang Mr.Mayor. least soften blow total lil man :( Capacity loses money United States. Hospital beds meant empty United States meant turned next patient quickly. Every empty bed thousands dollars lost. Healthcare like reality United States. Hospitals already suffered last 3 months balance much capacity risk putting hospital financial brink. 

This virus exposed various systematic issues; highlighted weaknesses healthcare system, social/racial inequality, cracks education system, general selfishness individual Americans. lack cooperation ability enforce unified response evident this. 

Many people waiting vaccine. Vaccines work majority cooperate get vaccinated also take months mount appropriate immune response effective may work everyone unintended effects harm. Masks effective everyone (1) available now, (2) long short term safety, (3) zero percent harm (4) work instantaneously. public health problem; public health problems require collective effort overcome. Vaccination, wearing masks, isolating/keeping distance ask public thing cooperation. 

We need major shift attitude right live worst-case scenario world see. $15/hr, 24hr/wk McDonald’s ain’t paying rent. student loans. food. health insurance. utilities. 

It’s it’s undesirable— it’s can’t live 25% normal income. 

And fast food ain’t gonna employ 18% NYC’s workforce. Get real.

And matter they’re well? They’re still paying minimum wage. Utterly delusional understanding real world. one year? That’s just... ! main county Pittsburgh- numbers rising. trying take steps help.stop that- people want freedom. I'll curious see happens. Thanks! Stay safe Percent positive starting creep back again, means they're capturing less virus compared three weeks ago. increase testing. Yep - would illegal landlord let electric get turned scenario. can't collect, can't evict, can't sell, can't reduce expenses. criminal. current US death total 130k people. believe death rate .04% overall, would mean roughly 330 million people America it.

I think missed two decimal places / got confused percentages.

Either way you’re wacky wrong... matter health insurance anymore. monthly premiums equivalent shaken protection racket. guaranteed right medical care, even though we're required money taken checks fund them?
 
But bring ventilator get rushed front line.
 
This happens people spend decades caring wins Bachelor wins office. top. Every level matters, needed leadership get found grossly lacking. read comments left below. I'm going waste time feeding troll attempt. million dead. going take one million dead Americans deniers swayed. one million dead numerous times infected Americans feel touch COVID-19. Deniers stop calling hoax reach number. anymore, no. big declassifications rare now.  reason believe cia complicit drug trade, know ones introduced crack black communities, know cia probably killed JFK, MLK, Americans. knew zapata oil base “anti-Castro” Cuban ops like bay pigs. didn’t know Northwood long time.  Hell, didn’t proof GWB covered Saudi government involvement 9/11, though obvious.  3 degrees separation arms dealer involved Iran-contra scandal found last year. people hands everything. Problem kill parents 22000 people died NYC, 0.26% entire population NYC. Thats fatality rate, understand confusion. actual fatality rate, would imply every single person NYC got coronavirus. didnt. closer 20-25% population, gives estimated fatality rate 1 1.25%

Source: I'm mathematician go!

 dont get vaccine, u might get autism... lmao Yeah, nothing 40 million march Washington. added bonus read American Airlines going full seating get faster greater numbers. That's problem. reading headlines paying attention one number. remember could count Toronto’s mayor smoke crack get black drunk? Good times back babies born year, would actually devastating society. make uneducated statement must trolling I’ll stop ;) plenty idiots too, like anywhere Earth human beings. Also TX 4 times population MA. 12 weeks? 

Dwight: That’s realistic timeline “unspecific” antibody tests. shouldn’t used COVID19 screening, aren’t used serological studies/screenings.

Again. goal posting CDC page? Dont forget self centered selfish. stupid fine, giving shit anybody else really put high gear. Breweries nicely. get distanced table group. waiter wears masks everyone everywhere except table. bar area closed, order via waiters. contact paying. Etc.  Restaurants use stink bombs indoors discourage unmasked people. Florida’s death rate exceed NY next month.  think drug companies taking advantage immunity granted trump get stocks sky rocketing. Well said. might white, hell supremacists crap. one people, humanity. learn open mind see beyond Murica, much worth seeing, reading learning about. Florida population 6% falls category increased risk due age. 60? think mortality rate 10 times higher 65. goes age. 85 years like 20%. Add still understood affects whole lot trouble. 65 Covid like ranging Typhoid fever 10-20% CFR. everyone Typhoid pretty darn serious.

Young people get spreads. Eventually older people going get it. I'm sure would say India makes effective copied drugs. certainly lot largest generic pharmaceutical company world Israel.

Currently India's production capacity severely hampered COVID 19 there's Chinese company already producing it. China also said would make vaccine available public good. Granted treatment, vaccine I'm guessing they'll anyway. I’ve going nightly jogs DTLA.. think stop starting today . Yes shouldn’t allowed use word conservative anymore either. isn’t conservative / conservation anything. wild control, truly conservative. hope collectively stop speaking deluded language call are, somewhere space control anti-American. long keep adding 600 infected hopital per day? assume working pop hospitals? Deaths skyrocket people cant get assistance. want ask hoaxers real pandemic would look like one fake. would look different now? think ""cycling people vaccination process"" phase much ""producing enough cover population"" phase. Lol, ok. people got infected protests went home infected even people. help case way think champ


Also, protests stopped. making look even dumber chances death low

I question. number cases obviously going way number deaths increasing proportionally? big issue vaccine making 8 billion doses distributing whole world. it’s something needs refrigerated think difficult is. 10%-15% zone quite days now, follow percentage positive rate Especially consider reaction originally saying 100k-200k lot people believed didn’t want to. made revise number memory. mean listen him. He’s Doctor hired cause key bringing aids epidemic 30years ago. (at time) mysterious delay transmittable disease skill killing people insidiously. listen dude hey? I’d hate hear figures thinks head rather conservative figures public.  someone northeast, it’s great see cooperative everyone this. everyone happy it, everyone compliant. live NJ parents live LI. I’ve heard anecdotes hospitals around going days without positive test. told April, probably wouldn’t believed you. Ohh means one ""its flu"" people. can't understand wtf wrong many us Americans, using mask god?!? Put damn mask shut up. lose? Coast There's lab wuhan might able sue. what's up. Thom Hartmann covers lot. densely packed crowd, chanting yelling, cloth mask nearly useless anything mitigate spread virus. UV light filters installed kill good amount bacteria germs. Unsure effectiveness covid though friend 9 year old daughter Southwest flight Denver Austin weeks ago. Flight attendants weren’t wearing masks flight fairly full. boarding, friend’s daughter politely asked one flight attendants would wear mask protect everyone. kicked flight. Fucking ridiculous. Oh right, original story? cop trying get accidental? No, that's different, alternative controlling women's bodies killing others\*... wait...

\* ^(let clear fetus full human use women medical equipment unacceptable, profound hypocrisy stated values) 10% September, 100% year over. Brimley would likely approve. I’m upset all, questioned gets participate new normal. That’s horrible, proof far shows likely reality? understand it’s probably early tell even enough every rich person? remind long takes someone die, lag reporting deaths areas seeing deaths then, also many deaths cases places having? upper class towns Central Valley? many deaths could would prevented simple mask? 

Traffic fatalities happen human, accidents occur. Many COVID deaths could prevented half population weren’t self-centered assholes. Two tricks I've personally used years past put mask high possible nose, glasses past connection. Another paper/non cloth masks strip medical tape across bridge nose forces air side. seems legit surprised. people book flight paid for, beat shit drag plane dont voluntarily get off. 330MILLION that's relatively small number. 40k die every year automobile crashes. better stop going places cars. 🤷‍♀️ 
When time die, time, regardless go out. Shit really? I’ve contractors us wore masks entire time. blows mind customers choose wear masks people come over.  It’s honestly variable it’s hard predict exactly people die. people go get tested different points illness, even symptoms, get admitted hospital. That's next level stupid, can't teach ""you can't lock people's freedom something killed small fraction thought would kill.""

Joe Rogan, June 12th 2020

Never forget gigantic piece shit. people like virus still thing. cry asked act shred decency trampling thier rights want thier freedom trample people's rights, lives, happiness. Deadly viruses time bunch maybes guessing. stfu science certain something. mean months minimum need articles saying anything still know shit. can't tell 14 year old boy, poorly trained TPUSA operative. Either way clumsy cringe stop. Good thing I’m here, would advise raw garlic instead! Aspirin damage lining gut, raw garlic shown kill 8 8 cancer cells vitro tested. also thins blood point advise avoid garlic prior Yes, true. I’m reacting. Still it’s lot lives already lost lost. sad. combination two surely tested. Spikes pneumonia heart disease deaths.

But Covid barely killing anyone, y'know?  pansies can’t take sacrifice. live NYC. know works it, disciplined it, WORKED. Nobody going get half measures. can’t believe won’t happen. Preemptive steps need taken ravage communities. tf people need pay 2-3X you’d normally pay coors lite anyway? time quarantine, learned cook better, mix drinks grow food. news health authority health ministry consider situation bad, government consider restrictions needed. Amazing Finland getting stage planning. Nevermind. don’t get comment it’s worth explaining must say, surreal living parts america control (at moment, anyway). feels like house cards Sturgill Simpson one favorite current country artists. actually put concert Ryman Auditorium fans audience live streamed raise money. also tested positive COVID early said 
 “At least Government appointed task force headed man believe science mass testing second task force works ‘open America back business’!”

Tyler Childers Cody Jinks great modern artists. used listen lot mainstream radio country got bored it. anyone suggestions another artist may like, let know love discovering new music. now? Germany need wear mask indoors since end April. Or, know, masks work 95 100 people idea fauci is. Vehicles least provide benefits society deaths issues cause. rampant virus provides benefits society, cost. It’s apples oranges even comparable metric like fatalities them. sense? Considering involves half time lessons live zoomed recorded pivot fully online zero notice trouble seeing could become worthless. Unless mean get vaccine next month, case I'm that. $1200 one time plus $500 per dependent think (I kids).

It start, more. Imho $1200 _per month_ say six months minimum safe and/or vaccine.

The problem course, people following guidelines rules.

What really, really burns us right thing. Work, groceries (wearing mask), home. going anywhere, trips, everything planned cancelled. visits friends. Extremely limited contact relatives, all.

Then John Q. Mouthbreather wearing mask, acting like there's nothing wrong. Flying planes. Going vacation Florida, new hotspot. hesitate use phrase ""it's fair"" sure sucks follow rules. one wear masks- rather can't everyone wear masks sporting events. canker sores symptom? HVAC tech here, 
I see two things, First off; Airflow. 80,000 sqft big box store could require 200 tons cooling. @400cfm per ton ac system would circulate 80,000 cubic feet air per minute. assuming 15 foot tall ceiling, system would circulate air store 4 times every hour. thats lot air.

Second; Turbulent flow. air comes vents turbulent. turbulence really good spreading mixing things fluids. Id say would great spread droplets air too.

Seems math makes sence this. might proven, possible hvac systems help spread covid. Cumo making right moves. Yup. Starts top. looks like last year around 36,000 traffic deaths whole year. We've Covid less half year. ban cars, bet ass deaths went 36,000 120,000 national experts would assessing major changes car safety would come standard new cars, likely retrofits cars would standard. US would likely bugger response too, people would afraid drive cars sure. could say you. still claim Trump greatest let’s see follow it. Let’s start disinfectant lungs. mean, know 6 people top head (including myself) trips CO last month.

I thought guys handling things great there. Maybe, actually want find actual % decreases by. Among worst vaccines last 50 years include ones induce(d) antibody-dependent enhancement similar viruses. Would risk Covid-19 seem scary safe Covid-19 meant common coronaviruses became fatal risks rest life?

Covid-19 huge, massive worldwide health crisis everyone concerned take reasonable precautions avoid contracting spreading it. injecting bleach smart way prevent it, neither rushing inject unproven vaccine (no disparagement volunteer participate controlled medical trials though). best friend moved recently closed house honestly doesn’t seem far fetched lol. generalizing ""don't want stay home"" I've working harder ever ""quarantine."" can't stay home 6 weeks. Frankly, sounds awesome sit home. American People problem. bet single commenter actually read article. California's bad also larger population. People talking Texas take seriously. Cloth mask right? Can't see someone running 95 Memorial Day, nation suffering 1,000 deaths per day. it’s 500. Omg get we’re already completely fucked. Yes, vaccine even tomorrow doesn’t mean pandemic over. pandemic likely called couple years. takes time vaccinate multiple billions people around word. 

So vaccine may come soon (hopefully) doesn’t mean pandemic done. think ~4 billion people vaccinated quicker couple years idea goes manufacturing distributing many doses around world making sure enough people get them. feel bad health workers. even stay motivated helping others insist putting everyone harms way? I’d imagine extremely demoralizing. Gotta support stomachs ever!  That's probably part it, know people gone insane neither use Facebook (or social media general) hang others do... there's sure. Yeah. 3 mos maternity/paternity leave starting next year. Sanctuary cities. Taking pandemic seriously. 

In way dude republican? Also common republican governors? blue state. imagine guy I'm getting fired either today tomorrow due covid I've got month find new job can't even pay rent food month Florida unemployment. $600 needs extended, many places hiring right due covid. Sorry nobody sane country visiting USA anytime soon. ain't Johnson fan. fact anything but. party also despicable. However, change. idiocy we're seeing coming others. suspect left Johnson, things would lot cautious. 

But like US, donate parties tend massive sway gets done get done. pro brexit multi millionaire buddies losing stacks cash businesses shuttered. Austrian seeing Massachusetts done, comforting. It’s easy forget US it’s 50 states aren’t one entity. states really taking precautions correctly everything going smoothly. Cause theyre rednecks exercising right clog hospitals hope Houston Austin say f that. places least better that. DC mayor done it. find better rebuttle. Also associate ego country origin I’m curious why? There’s definitely truth that, country desperately trying reopen, small businesses lure folks unemployment make much it?

We've deficit way, way long. Read article. links relevant peer reviewed studies. Sounds like need smoke another one say 620 new hospitalizations, increase 620 hospitalized? doubt that’s entirely true. example someone already virus believed immune, better time score cheap vacation? believe true national level regional trends really different. 


The positive rate dropped ton northeast northeast also testing lot. That’s hauled national rate down.  Basically NYCs disaster contained there. 

The south: positive rates increasing Another pump dump small biotech. becoming par course pandemic. many “100% cures” miracle vaccines read since March July still real way defeat virus. abundant amount old folks facilities Florida makes extremely scary. guy understands physical contact. Agreed, we’ll see trouble vaccine development suddenly awkward position. Nature always taken care emerging disease increasing immunity among population. Either infected recently vaccination. think tricked nature isolating crashing economy. Could go wrong. Please stfu. Getting tired winning. Imagine 'woke' consider someone speaking people wishing death others snowflake. Honestly, written easy understand manner. source, clearly sites sources used article. article links journal articles. Maybe 1% people going read journal articles directly. hope realise country honest data, testing 95 percent world, mean alone alot cases. still believing China Russia?

Rand Paul’s neighbor- come get mans he’s wildin’ Well said. Look, argue you. must take contrary position, saying ""No, isn't"". lmao Classes need online fall. classes cannot held online, universities allow students either sit semester without losing scholarships reapply, faculty staff allowed work home. Bringing thousands students campus over, irresponsible. Even one student per dorm room freshmen, they're still using showers restrooms. administration cannot actually believe restricting car use keep students campus dorms weekends. Plot twist History indicates continue act idiots. Get ready 6 digits normalized. PEOPLE really hard find fair comparison. spread massively Northern Italy happened flu season period, considered pneumonia. Every country Italy extra time prepare. situation probably even worse Northern Italy statistics show. I'm sure everybody died care homes old people dying home tested period. daily number cases really good indicator place started mass testing. course containment efforts USA failure, look death rate per capita compare Northern Italy March. I'm pretty sure even close bad Texas right now. What's 19? That's odd name... Well know 😉 ...what? less spending result higher national debt ever before. doesn't. acts like America used bastion freedom democracy laments longer good old days. actually address real problems. Perhaps public policy then, seems like always period 'cleaning house' whenever new party comes in. 

Unpopular policy, employees whose political leanings mesh incomming admin, seems visible purge, generally. Eek! get kind subsidy get tested cheaper? netherlands 800 icu beds. corona scaled 2300, lot trouble healthcare workers tripple time.

Also, let's switch measuring temperatures Celcius. fired data scientist charge manipulate data. reporting numbers even matter data give can't even trusted? asshole Toby Keith also song goes, ""How ya like now."" bragging song, listen many times week general surgery. 

He basically says song girl like high school, really like famous. simple reality zero chance getting bill though Congress unemployment. Unemployment might 'only' cost 250 billion, bill authorizing trillions. yes, getting unemployment extended cost trillions. Would work US? You‘re unemployed everyone gets $600 week short while? get additional unemployment money state it?  cheap, easy use product could like wear faces essentially eliminate spread virus.

A man dream.. man dream... mutually exclusive. recession creates job losses. Job losses generates less tax income state. People spend less, also generating less income state. Interest debt still needs paid, heads that's around $400bn. Essential services still need provided.

A collapsed economy lack spending creates problems. There’s lot reasons reported testing fluctuate. time. Let’s wait see happens 11 today day’s numbers released. 

Percent positive remained around 14%. bad. Australia zero confirmed infections result protests: fact people gathering briefly outdoor space wearing masks incredibly low risk. need random sample. protesters wore masks. Cant say beachgoers, bar hoppers, sit restaurants, casinos, etc. even get plane? would like getting cruise ship rite now. soon. think mask would help metal tube another hundred people hours time? Come on. never bought ticket first place. know risk. Bananas! Protesters: outdoors people mostly masked

Bars: indoors likely poor air circulation people mostly unmasked sucks would bad move actually. thought would never come, we'd taking entirely different approach. Right we're suppressing virus, assuming keep bay relief vaccine.

Our approach right actually betting fast vaccine. Even vaccine comes 2 years, that's bad outcome approach. economy cannot stand long without spiraling control. perfect stimulus/support, bad economy mild hardship most. However, even perfect policy, conditions move bad economy basically something much worse great depression couple years.

So ""we'll never vaccine"" approach would expand hospital capacity carefully let virus spread. Maybe even intentional infection young/healthy people speed along herd immunity let go endemic, like 1918 flu. wear press arent looking. presidential seal looks creating divides American people that's campaign strategy. wants rile base libs, working time. incompetence shown Joe actually quite likable. Cheers, may get passed soon enough, President views mask wearers signaling disapproval him.       
*""President Donald Trump said Americans might wear face masks way prevent spread coronavirus way “signal disapproval him.”*    

People thought narcissistic personality disorder would harmless. Trump, everything him, staked position masks damaged country. Hardly harmless.   
Meanwhile, rest us, including people like Mitch McConnell recognizing masks give us best chance salvaging reopenings, give us **only** chance. don’t instagram There's 700000 people San Fran right. begun  learned anything? *If you’re going something, right.”*

The trump administration perfect example happens don’t. agree. Like states young people? Maybe natural selection giving humanity hand. Great job guys keep em coming ah see I'm bars value life.

Nevermind, American way. aren’t even going stipulate WebMD level knowledge (average incubation period 5 days, 95% people develop symptoms day 12 post-exposure), acknowledge logically, means protests 4 weeks ago didn’t cause spike, would shown 2 weeks ago, I’m going spoon feed anything. keep ignorant, kiddo. virus doesn’t give shit, neither I, you’re making look like fucking idiot.

Literally go WebMD, look incubation period, apply logic, think 5 minutes, come back explain spike didn’t happen 2 weeks ago, go. Otherwise, you’re acting like fucking idiot. clarify, people chronic disease pathways get free medicine besides offered 25 25. think impacted referees well. There's huge decline amount cards given. Yeah depends interpretation apologies. mean general ugliness yes, ugliest. thought meant fucked things poorly incompetent it. think fair blame early efforts however think something like 75 days hospital reductions also hard know sometimes. I'm like, oh, lot? follow US numbers behaving like unified country, look local numbers. look today see compare to. 

Today's total new US cases, 38,000. hope right seems like Desantis move try blame bars.... Young people getting sick dying. Bars reopened, young people got sick.

Also lag. ""Survive *this*, motherfucker!"" Yeah I’ve restaurants bars. always sit outside, remarkably easy social distance. person came within 6 feet waitress, wore mask. would surprised anybody spreading virus situation. felt good it.

Now I’m 38, mind you, longer go bars see 200 twenty-somethings packed outdoor patio, many inside. That’s hard pass me.  Morons going moron. That's property NH owned staters. multiple layers protection place fly us, including required face coverings, enhanced cleaning procedures, pre-flight COVID-19 symptom checklist — we’re providing additional flexibility customers change travel plans, well.

So essentially total 4 extraordinary protection layers, 2 passenger's responsibility, one bullshit checklist, last (cleaning) something passengers can't actually verify happening like before, cool. mean, pin hopes masks even 100% compliance prevent spread. time, several countries barely anyone wears mask yet show significantly reduced case counts (e.g. Scotland, Netherlands, Belgium)  I'm afraid going happen Europe well. outside today saw lot people without masks. full tourists. don’t realize proving point, you? bed person it, full. Whether covid not, capacity issue exacerbated Covid. Isn’t drug barely anything? insane World Warcraft bug money society pandemic. saying respect people’s perspectives issues? 

Imagine someone that’s unintelligent need people comply platitudes empty thinking.  many lies, hate, miss information small text. even need learn countries. Bush Obama already put together plan. follow it. yet word Florida posted 9.5k cases June 27th. I'm starting think media bias make appear us Floridians better are.  


Universal/NBC Disney much mainstream media, far stretch imo Corona deaths excess deaths. specific context excess deaths occurring relative mean baseline mortality, big excess deaths margin context. aware distinction, remarked interpretations. hopsitals collapse completely kill tourism. ignoring continue indefinitely help anything? people stupid? Haha, paying living wage America? Fat chance. forget countries helped proving validity treatment like UK others Europe screwed. still fairly underhand approach apparently breaks agreements relate sort thing. fairness guys states need though... Well derrrrrr I’m sure obtuse deadlines virus. previous comment stating US deaths flu coronavirus. switching using worldwide numbers. responded back facts, obviously ignored. What’s deal? goal denying facts? I’m curious. 


*The CDC estimates 46,000 95,000 Americans died due influenza 2017-18 flu season.*

125,000 Americans died since March Covid-19. Haha yeah urinal pillow sounds like experience requiring forget-me-now pill. great logic. Hospital stays already super expensive, what’s measly $3000. one who’s lost job likely doesn’t insurance. Since brilliant system ties employment health insurance government trying end ObamaCare fucking pandemic. We're talking US whole. Florida different story. Nail fucking wall guys stabby instead shooty hopefully polite? Facebook got caught tanned lol. Increased eating fish eggs. sunny may bit June. Sadly sun gone I'm sure that's true helpful, luck; 0 is, unfortunately, probably daily blip short term. 

Still, probably secondary factors primary factor particular case: now, Massachusetts drove cases exponentially.

There nice charts /r/boston subreddit:

 1%ers becoming 0.5%ers good thing, progress opposite this. Got rebuttal. Clearly humiliating error. started suggesting Swedes read graph. Yeah Zach Bryan, bs. official way asking people travel states. NY isn’t cops pull people state plates going door door searching staters like Rhode Island doing. didn’t know supplements might work! saying that's horrible thing. saves human lives, well animals, where's bad side it?  Unflatten curve! Unfortunately lot bad would expected. sad af. Mothers teach babies jerkwads please need better generation come next. mean Florida start lying abouy many people hospitalized COVID mean, video watched didn’t say kids faces covered? Yes, hospital shortage usage surged distributers allocating it. incredibly high unemployment currently giving leaving businesses without employees. worse economy. can't government spend way prosperity here. issues 70 patients survived COVID-19 pneumonia, 66 level lung damage visible CT scans taken hospital discharge

So article talking asymptomatic cases mild cases. see ""serious cases"" repeated throughout.

Then lung damage seen Wuhan study cases likely gradually heal disappear, Wang colleagues suspect.

And patients, lung abnormalities harden layers scar tissue known pulmonary fibrosis.

Which interesting *prediction*, would good actually demonstrate proof.

But important thing help ventilator also cause lung damage, *it may difficult tell patients’ injuries stem dysfunctional immune response virus versus ventilator*

Which interesting.

But guess basic issue - seen SARS, MERS H1N1 influenza, **we expect** least COVID-19 patients residual disease,” says Ali Gholamrezanezhad, radiologist University Southern California Los Angeles. 

Do know actual studies indicating *these expectations confirmed*? kind stuff finding difficulty actually finding. Found guy never boss. fucks sake man... Neither mayors will. spineless scared elections I’m sure get that’s price meds. doesn’t include hospital fees entirely composed ignorant hillbilly assholes. Yes that’s people doing. Lots lots mortars BBQs. vote them. Democracy failed us people still mad Baker, primarily party. Interesting. Thanks info. 
I agree marketing budget ridiculous US companies advertising medicine. 

I little skepticism though study though (I dived deep article linked, going words abstract). difference growth companies sustained companies. big top 100, I'd assume, sustain companies want keep selling flagship drug since makes bulk profit. see logic spending much new products since current product profitable, thereby spending even marketing.

On flip side, R&amp;D based companies product needs marketed, therefore spend budget marketing. also appear top 100 reason. 

Hmm... address fact drugs sold top companies expensive. They're past R&amp;D phase, companies specifically, people paying advertised to. It’s effective early infection, serious illness help notice say ""We'll start reporting accurately"" few, though. *critical mass* whereby culture society suffering assholes concentration rate poisons everyone. reason Trump elected he's cause symptom. problem. *We* are. way, way many garbage people sustain healthy society much less functioning democracy.

We're showing rest world, ourselves, really are. pretty sight. Around 70% NZ's international tourists come nations virus less suppressed. believe plan open nations soon.

In meantime, guess New Zealanders would holiday nation instead traveling nations provide boost. guess restrictions whatsoever, besides closed borders, helpful regard.

Also get 20% number from? Tourism contributes 5.8% NZ GDP directly, 4% indirectly. Maybe meant 20% exports? compassion visa I've read about. I've looked details that's say hope pity. breach Kiwis came home funeral, probably chances dropped significantly, tbh. hurt try. “For dozens...AND DOZENS! fans,” -Mick Foley Accountant here, got laid mid-March due Covid still job postings... mostly temp agencies looking fill rolls (not necessarily actual positions fill right now.) I've applying everything remotely comparable last months I'm starting worry... immune system stinks really can't risk taking service job anymore. antibodies, cells well.

Actually, number cases (I've seen 40%, 30% 20% three published studies), depending infection severity, actually produce protective antibodies, seems 90%+ produce cells offer least degree protection amount time.

To answer OP's question, produce cells antibodies response initial infection; also create various 'helper' cells specific disease reexposure body mount rapid and, hopefully, effective response.

Think immune 'memory', immune memory marks difference primary (initial) secondary (subsequent) immune response. going leave ""how give Covid goats question it""

Can goats get all? many species thing Dogs, Tigers, Bats, lions seen moment. Gathering groups spreads Coronavirus

Health Care Workers (who take care sick asses) Matter! Site falling due load. Here's map: Even though masks likely cotton polyester blends, meaning literally effective t-shirt pulled face. whole point here. Nah, unless dying body fighting producing antibodies, get atleast short time immunity. basically virus live together, like getting infected daily. can't infected already infected, recover first give kind immunity, maybe weeks, maybe months years, enough time recover.  can’t believe people actually upvoted this. everything race? People like take story nothing race make comment like bring cause division. You’re saying reason they’re something skin color. nerve call everyone else racist! Bullshit.

We would watching show car, spaced well apart anyone else, interacting three members household. seems safe enough theory, fact basically every city canceled shows makes think maybe it’s good idea, plus sheer number people area (usually ~15,000) makes nervous.

Look Regan, Schwarzenegger, Sonny Bono...I feel like I’m missing someone important shitty governor Abbott. Lina Hidalgo Turner Houston trying, keep getting overruled Abbott. Also, people don’t realize huge Texas is. Texas 254 counties county judge 😭 like 254 different corona virus responses. Enough ""research"" Thanks. know that. don’t think analogy works. Pedestrians putting entire communities risk walking around. People don’t wear masks literally causing ICU units fill up. don’t like told something. opposite. It’s mind set 5 year old. I'm sure fact checkers getting something wrong could anything *but* plot point. Sorry, guess missed part “in total control.” Thank you, ill check out!  increased demands social security disability people can't work. shortages physically taxing jobs like construction workers, fireman, etc... Oh I'm well aware shit show. see exact attitude caused much worse US country. Ahhh deflection, see quite familiar Well one saying need wear masks public months well. you. thought would want know downvotes since asked. What....the fuck.

Thanks, beginning make sense now. That's terrifying. agree, unfair well managed better irony... early enough administration reduces odds serious complications. don’t think effective enough save old people, deaths even need report understand case. Poor people hit harder everything crises natural disasters They'll pull 1950s Superman excuse say ""They died heat stroke"" problem. media mixed messages political agenda nobody-knows science caused state nobody knows believe. following social distancing mask wearing since thing started, legit point time started think joke crazy everyone else seemed living normally media started pushing hoax.

The real tragedy whole thing blatant political agenda mainstream media way twisted news benefit political side. american people want unadulterated facts related virus media outlets clearly politically driven distorting facts. poor Healthcare workers TEXAS ! guy idiot !

You get that, right? show zero symptoms, five days, yet you’re spreading everyone touches stuff touched stand within six feet minutes breathe air droplets. Like staff stores, bars, person behind line, etc. 

This individual liberties. It’s actions pose danger everyone else, many critical employees trying keep things functioning.

The longer people say screw want, longer last people die. Many countries proven beat virus get back functioning economy people governments right thing. kind audience though. mean Apple one big competitor cool brand. Twitter really around Steve Jobs faceplant on. Tr*um!p's whole brand he's ""mean man."" ""You're fired!"" love that! Tesla different brand cautious. I’m 27. median age patients infected area YOUNGER me. 19-24 age group far highest infection positivity rate. fucking time Donald. China still extremely reactive.

They fucking shut like baker's dozen. almost 50,000 new cases day.

China dug whole ass roads keep people quarantined.

Now, see implemented Back School safety measures shit safer hospital. Everyone's shoes sprayed, temperature checks, mandatory masks, social distancing dividers, thermometers, hand washing stations, time built part school day.

And beautiful mandatory testing upon arrival held results negative, mandatory masks, social distancing measures, cleaning routines.

China's airports fucking cleaner hospital lunch room right now. people dying want stop it. daughter saw doctor two days ago COVID19 testing (daughter sick), asked either (Dallas Texas). said Fox News. know sheep eating like prime hay. bad US is, nowhere near bad China. sit say trump fat racist dumbass won’t disappear next day. However, it’s black white, definitely heading slippery slope. Want know reopenings halted? right here. wapo, open article private window read it. makes safe? bunch people sitting enclosed spaces either masks. going quite time bring that, seeing every state allowed well forgive you. wtf? know onset first symptoms would still 5-14 days virus much deadlier?

What fuck this? like arguing nonsense hypothetical situations?

I time this. didn’t know existed. I’m impressed creativity stupidity. interpreted mean *assume* ready then. plan ready November come February gov scramble Well post pic dick far away. Things may normalish then. Imagine Texas testing rate NY (during peak), would love know incredibly control spread actually gotten thanks incompetent elected officials science-denying masses. cOmMoN SeNsE bro. facts lies. biased hypotheses facts truth. r/moronavirus True, there's already two threads it. Admittedly, lot upvotes either I’m Pittsburgh- everyone wearing mask- except young college aged crowd. go surrounding townships it’s different story. amount young adults apartment building wear masks astounding....I still get weird looks go mail room mask gloves on.... Deaths per cases ALWAYS low point outbreak. new cases growing exponential rate, deaths lag behind weeks. didnt mean imply linear, extrapolate growth rate based past 3 weeks data- correctly give nice j curve. woman actually want called womxn? wish would apply restrictions WHOLE state rather areas.

As much would suck county shut again, agree. county right next two ordered shut down. I'd lying said apprehensive prospect people counties traveling find something everything near shut down.

And certainly help county largely built tourism industry. Oh good one, one laughed Right you. HEB need masks enter people seem take half wear I'm inside. . .

And actually family take seriously thinks hoax another level difficult. would thought global pandemic could political. Closing would still help overall, yeah, would good 3 weeks things continuing get worse... closing 3 weeks systems completely failing mean getting back ""not-failing"" sooner... always help, point failed either way. Trump shifts messaging realizing he’s losing support ratings plummeting - abysmal response pandemic 130,000 people died due constant spreading misinformation. described daughter. also suspect gifted. swear 4 going 14, emotional rational maturity 2 year old. Georgia, thought fine. happened? One month late allow it. /s Sweden may well aspect alone. 

In Ireland, currently [half million patients](http://newslab.ie/ddjucd/irelands-ailing-healthcare-system-more-than-half-a-million-patients-waiting-to-see-a-specialist/) waiting see specialist - population 5 million. 

UK hospital waiting lists [could hit 10 England year.

All takes tiny fraction people die related illnesses caused inability access medical services - highly likely - people died country alone Covid.

One thing pandemic shown current healthcare systems barely fit pupose definitely fit anything might cause strain them. great job masks area. take only, last saw. influx people states though, I'm cautiously optimistic numbers going down. US Mexico always gonna get fucked we're fat. indication ADE animal early stage human trials though. expect problem, least case many places hiring right due covid.

i feel that. lost job late april zero traction. past, raised hand job weeks. eventually get job hell painful. Pretty sure setup next month, say invented masks one would listen brilliant idea. Please feel free elaborate. criteria I've seen specific, based science, logical way deduce cause death. course could completely eliminate conversation still testing capacity issue country. know, 6 months later. 

Tell me, job, company told needed something ASAP, took 6 months produce said thing colleagues produce required work 2 months, would managers reaction be? That's reasonable. Lived WI. confirm people encountered incredibly stupid, entitled, racist. would rather die give bars wear masks. tell wait next Wednesday? havent haircut five months. Like fart wind ever say mad job? Anxious, sure. also angry. fuck federal government?? 85% chance confirmation still infinitely better 0%. He's right though. plague disappeared Europe. Took four hundred years though. Oh god describing five year old. MERS. Moderna vaccine also around awhile clinical trials point (both finished phase 1s prior this) targeting Zika. Russians usually excellent English don’t sink billions dollars something “Hope” works.

you also sink billions dollars going eventually sell cost. 

So information getting? know add up, it? HEB (Texas) already TP paper towels went Monday. No.

She tell people immediately afraid flak she'd get.

Sounds like admit people already talking it.

So feel guilty possibly giving people. cared social standing.

When experts provides testimony court, said experts often backs testimony via evidence. case, providing ""thinking"" rather interpreting evidence hand, sometimes giving tldr research.

On hand, contact say Nature Lancet tell need start publishing expert opinions absent studies? hardly better before. think Alex Jones yahoos read Politico? needs start wearing mask regularly forcefully defend mask ordinances. end madness. one biggest trolls subreddit. joke dingus test sick people, still.

SOURCES: It’s like reading comment 4 moths ago. May ask needed fly? entirely possible...100% people claiming survival fittest never go hospital take medication. Absolute hypocrites God, 6+ months this? know it’s possible, damn. That’s depressing hell. see Denmark across Öresund neighborhood, nobody parts wish travel right now. 
People really shocked brutally Danish state, emergency laws, fines waiting bus infringement civil liberties.
On top fun places probably closed ruined virus, Danish people probably also rude standoffish towards Swedes usual well. 
I think people wish escape goat second wave comes .. yes, Danish tribalism blame others second wave. 

Last hypocrisy traveling thousands, Swedes suffer lot BS , hypocrisy one them.

I wont go likely years, I'm already 3rd year I'm kinda used anyway. yeah, guy. 

Meanwhile tens thousands excess deaths counted. 

In words, nuts. Absolutely nuts. fuck them. trying desperately prop till election day players 

Big time $$ universities arguing 100% excess deaths covid deaths? Aussies Vegemite Relative states safe. Connecticut around 20 120 new cases day. vast majority people self isolate. Also, haven’t see one person without mask indoors. States seeing rising cases opened early, point states *will* reopen. Connecticut getting point allowing indoor seating won’t actually cause increase cases. Herd immunity great strategy vaccine. Don’t give bad name!

There nothing US can’t start see results. dead dead, can’t bring back, drastically reduce transmission thus number new cases starting moment right approach.  structures place maintain life within reasonable lockdown time period would simply done every country implemented month-2 month lockdown universally moved lives without need multi year lockdown. theoretical non theoretical multi year lockdowns necessary sustainable. Please stay away da Yoop, trolls!

Less 200 cases 300k people. We’ve got virus lockdown! 

People actually wear masks grocery stores (about 95% compliance) socially distance beaches, least Marquette.

Lots space spreeeeaaaad out. Woods, lakes, etc. helps us. Can’t speak I’m visiting parents weeks town 2K it’s pretty much exactly like describes. I’m visiting Dallas 60% people taking serious. Feels weird person family wear mask take seriously. lost count number mindless comments TikTok complaining government overreach due shutdown mask ordinances. 

To nobody's surprise, people saw BLM protesters beaten cops thought best response would ""Back blue! [flag emoji] Put animals place!""

I'm ashamed America, especially Texas. Yeah, really didn’t obviously want quote anything obviously like pointing stupid shit instead contributing conversation ok whatever nationwide. Hospitals get funding classifying death covid related. there's absolutely question there's massive undercount. end shortened season? Hate get excited told so, give one month later. It'll feel like double defeat you. I'm little surprised extra 17"" (width average economy-class seat) space one side really make much difference. important thing everyone masked times. much-vaunted HEPA filters, cabin air chance go without first opportunity carry droplet another passenger. Also, HEPA filters utterly useless A/C turned off, typically boarding deplaning, incidentally likely exposed. airlines shut A/C whenever aircraft ground, sometimes even leave takeoff, save fuel reduce mechanical wear. Interestingly, practice leaving HEPA filtration effectively disabled time greatest risk discussed all. northeast restrict incoming visitors out? Thanks! bring back some! miss college YES Texas currently track double number cases little two weeks. happens, 1% Texans tested positive end two weeks. Another two weeks it'll 2%. 4%. seriously track infecting single-digit fractions state. Seriously. 1 10 Texans testing positive October. fucking joke. Don’t even need science this. look cities experienced enough take seriously. Connecticut New Hampshire still green! Go safe! Nah, check out. Far-UVC actually interesting. Seems promising, studies need done course.

That's still cancer-causing light frequency.

I'm gonna go ahead reply response well. inserted say everyone know issue, speaking though *entire working class* struggling, we're said so. Many people still jobs, lots places opening back people getting back work. Anyone ""essential job"" working whole time. millions unemployment part time, unnecessary, worked job that's coming back while. people need find something else survive on, sit around crying government gonna keep paying bills. bayou it’s Trump country. people know stopped caring soon Trump started ignoring it.

Why people scared go COVID? Yeah like Florida southern States covering s*** Indeed. U wear mask u yet sick. Cos u sick u need mask cos u stuck home. 

So u yet tested u sick. U would breath back virus. beginning state less u ""fully"" sick. breath back virus pillow sleep.

Americans ultimately regret allowing government kind control. It’s like running wall playing get concussion first Better yet, stay home! yeah week ending scenario. unfortunate. gonna cancelled.

RemindMe! September 10, 2020 Well Gerald always easy see stead general... Still 10% what's expected. would imply 10000 deaths pneumonia Florida. They're missing deaths 90% them. Stop ""rates 10% what's expected."" Like conspiracy could cover 90% covid deaths They’re killing it! happens elect “strong man” leader. They’re actually strong, crumble pressure every single time. Wow guess common thought. great know may eventually return normal. me, 'chemical' smell/taste certain foods, reminds artificially scented aerosol sprays something.. Anything fried containing vegetable oil seems flavor (probably good thing honest). Also, similar condition, anything containing fragrances (shampoo, soaps, deodorant) smells pretty horrid Makes wonder last 4 months! Let’s add taking taking racist power roles. Oh Halloween extra spooky time around.  worse? Trump administration China? Even answer China little, that's really fucking bad. Divided States fucked Italian restaurant apartment Dallas still outdoor seating. single person social distancing wearing mask (besides waitstaff). 

Are *trying* get sick possibly die? countries hit hard... Sobering view worked Russia years. really excellent scientists institutions. 

However, Manufacturing competency great. mean, read study. tested Sars-cov-2, similar coronaviruses 

It's like, yeah course fire kills everything path effective killing weeds, maybe pesticides might good middle ground instead. killing millions people. Europe's case 30 60 % (keeping mind world lot less populated today). 
It's like walk hands, donate kidney 2 gallons blood sacrifice firstborn unnamed god safe lifes... least outside lowers risk getting  True. again, person wearing mask risks transmission directions increased probability Hell, week ago people still bragging Georgia’s cases still dropping even though reopened. even linked graphs showed exact opposite... Face shields way go GOP rallies! bigger, better! Masks optional! Shop Asian store, 99 Ranch etc, near 100% mask compliance. stopped going TJs Sprouts beach areas many Brahs Karens wearing masks. I’m bit tired people saying something like “120k Americans died this.” know right side argument, it’s 120k RECORDED deaths absolutely closer 400k reality. opinion, noted every stat like recorded deaths nowhere near actual amount. You’re bothered LOL People laughing us. Washington hellbent they're sayinf Boo-urns like education system unbalanced it’s kind impossible judge holistically since quality education different schools varies significantly. New York feel like it’s matter time crisis again. I'd assume becos LA status city. trendy mask.... Fair enough, sorry implying mindset. .... live developed country, USA!

MWAHAHAHAHA [rip ur grandma im It’s pretty difficult emigrate Canada tenacity it. cold man, cold Lol Alabama. Figures. Yalll yallll yalllll yallllllllll pretty strong base imo now. Right one working getting bonus. Condoms, masks gloves help.  original statement made sound like reoccurring phenomenon yet asked there’s one instance extreme case... security guard. It’s messed people suffer accordingly it’s cherry picking. Burlingame ... inside fine, everyone masked. Outside? Maybe really busy (I avoid Burlingame Ave really busy, though). Burlingame Ave dog morning pretty much one mask. empty enough constantly passing others enough people sitting benches (not eating, excuse) without masks sidewalks wide enough give 6' clearance bench. Sometimes really miss living small town. see things like this, remember jackasses dealt middle school, think, ""Nah I'm good staying city 2+ million people."" all, I'm suggesting break rules decency either. Never forget **Trump save lives wearing mask** well. Remember! Remember remember everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

But also, death reports take time come out, also initial spreads outbreaks seem caused younger people deaths delayed virus generation people pass older relatives. know lot, practice know exactly what's going happen, helpful look places already rough guide. publications videos like that. remember woman making video hospital. Warning people effects. used healthy. video saw cough sounded like piece lung. looked really painful.


But media spread seems. Well shit. I'm one unhappy Californian. well too. exactly NHL needs choose Canadian cities Las Fucking Vegas. God hope do.  getting almost comical now. Yup - brother law came fix A/C. go store part paying drove wore masks car since live us. Hope works does, protect mitigate severity illness, scaling producing local international users way economic superpowers expand reach helping hand. death count ""confirmed cases"" vastly undercounted. really know either except retrospect. ""but already made plans..."" Technically... He's probably wrong.

It appear mutate rapidly contagious.

If everyone catches fast enough, it'll run warm vulnerable bodies infect disappear.

But certainly best way handle this. asexual fuck helps! live Houston reach Galveston 20 minutes. It’s battle two anecdotes then. you’re experiencing Miami reflective central Florida 2-3 weeks? week ago, suggested Texas best, 2 weeks topped entire hospital capacity. 1 week go tell, accelerated spread.

Things absolutely going worse Texas New York simple reason enough space people care need it. Even approved fall, approval different distributed administered. agree. wimp now. county live 99% capacity ICU beds. sure, financially speaking country fucked. burden youth come back this. economy cyclical, ups downs, things really throw balance set things back. virus one them. 

From big corporations shutting down, evictions families, truly disaster. truth jobs aren’t opened patronized, people can’t pay rent ultimately can’t pay property taxes takes money away community. system designed Achilles heel, virus unexpected really catch everyone guard. We’ve got long way go. Beyond actually controlling virus aspect pandemic, financial nightmare waiting us. disgrace GA resident here. delay takes TX, FL CA even scratched surface based population difference. least month ahead them. man withdrew us Paris Accord folks heard one ‘real’ person angry it. practically heard one single person even wants travel abroad time. jesus... acts like isnt getting worse people act like causing outbreaks... idk point.

im probably gonna see many comments, weighted positive negative connotations, correlate many new daily/weekly/monthly cases had. said another thread, feel deserves repeating here....have seen commercial NOVA? attract visitors Myrtle Beach? “Myrtle Beach, happiness comes waves.” can’t make shit up. Pure security theater. Ain't pretty normal pattern though? Many users, including me, lurks reddit seldom comment see something makes us think ""shit, actually contribute topic"" question want answered already asked, rarely happens tbh. nearly 3000 cases reported today, cases backdated graphed health department's site. european, wonder: going tell amish? covid affect communities general? privacy! Can't tell anyone employee sick secret /s thing me, I'm pissed off! Cant argue guess. stats well personal stories attesting consequences need become widely spread: Meat good. Good luck. Wish something else say would help. Thank update, stay safe. Headline read, ""Houston Moves COVID-19 Patients Hospitals Houston"" Makes sense community spread...tracking never chance US. watch every day news home country trace flareup usually circulating amount virus population low ( 1 5 percent depending day) exponential growth curve population limited ability comprehend means. People refuse understand get better quickly. July Texas long hard slog don’t blame friends neighbors making plans GTFO next month. frustrating thing rest country people spread far wide. politics people spew disinformation kill hundreds thousands people. mods ethical obligation issues deadly. Rioting died down, gotta repack powder keg. Oh fucks sake... want spiteful asshole say told so, amount shit I'm getting telling friends wear mask, cautious, I'm going hard time sympathizing people opposing this.
I know I'll ultimately better person fuck really want case. idea planning distribution would imagine would phases. Olds first. smaller percentage population, sickly. middle aged. kids. don’t 7 billion doses opening day. Lol. missed point.

That's science. One study significant measure anything.

From one links posted : Kris Ehresmann, state Department Health director infectious disease, said enough results draw firm conclusions impact mass gatherings Minnesota’s coronavirus outbreak.

Confirmation bias powerful. Feel free keep looking information reinforces beliefs want have. think people choosing go know risks. wearing mask saying this? $700m ailout buy 30% equity trucking company worth $70m open legal cases accused defrauding DoD?

Stop trying politicize everything. part problem distracting real problem.

States underreporting deaths. real problem. matter R support. data reported accurately everyone, otherwise fucked already.

And yes, completely understand government politicizing pandemic. mean thing. smart. Wear mask. Social distance. demand better state local governments, regardless letter represent. Yes. Far syringes/needles right now. :(

2) claim start?

3) total income year's period question (which usually 15 months claim 3 months claim)?

4) max income highest quarter year?

With 4 pieces info, calculated. fever extreme fatigue clotting issues. thought would go away still clot much. Pre-covid used bleed like crazy tiny cut bleed unless take blood thinners. Ah, yes, ""I'm baked got C+ macroeconomics"" approach economy.

Money real. backed real, physical things, meaning deeply embedded social contract holds literally society together.  people inherently lazy. one crazy enough drive 30 minutes another county taco sushi unless ""special"" destination spot. Sure live county border big deal, 90% residents trouble worth, especially resurgent rush hour crush freeways. 2 weeks. That's guess. well that's one difference, although beaches opened well beaches crowded. Nobody hopeful deaths. hopeful states pull back re-opening institute lockdowns deaths happen. fact many sub watching cases increase, watching hospitalizations increase similar trajectory weeks later, saying ""but derp deaths"" symptomatic thinking that's repeatedly prevented us reacting thing late.

TL;DR COVID produced deaths instantaneously, (as species) would much better dealing it. delays incredibly helpful preventing humans reacting need to. ask, answer no. close vaccine available? tens millions high-risk people done everything right pandemic, including strict quaranting wearing masks. get virus makes people callous think comment pretty thoughtless. long since we've specific national hardship. People really compliant. There's allery reducing cat food? know trials listed somewhere? couldnt find anything ones referring to. Hilariously North Carolina Board Law Examiners cramming 850 people two rooms end month. Today says hold beer. Friday sitting fresh kegger though. Florida daily report documents read here: 

http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf

If scroll bottom page 2 (where 15.4% listed)

""This percent number people test positive first time divided people tested day, excluding people previously tested positive.""

Whereas states report number new tests + number new cases, thing people calculate new tests / new cases. can't wrap head around doubling things spiral control *right front them.* direct evidence need lock things (or least mandate masks public) basically ignoring numbers skyrocket. Almost outstanding. Recognition outdoors panacea. 

It goes downhill order says documentation required exception. anyone know get population density based inhabited area? Using total area exactly give good idea close people average. Let's say two states, 100 square miles, 2 people.

State #1: person lives 50 square mile plot.

State #2: person lives 100 square foot plot, rest land uninhabited.

Both states population density 0.02 people per square mile, people State #2 living right near confined spaces.

I suspect AZ would still lower density measure method since major cities like Phoenix Tuscon probably much sprawling old urban patterns Boston. might well vegan, that's usual social experience. know onset first symptoms would still 5-14 days virus much deadlier? Got examples diseases behave like that?

Less people mild cases would walking around

Less hospital staff would get infected number people ICU beds would lower  Damn, good know. “but meant like might bought blue recently.”

You might missed part though. :) could blame them? 

Uhhh... Ukrainians denied testing? Europeans may accept sick travelers would like? Literally anyone else cares transparency? case, closing bars restaurants again. Confirmed cases mean much population differences testing quantities. 

The relevant stats hospitalizations positive test rate imo.  Okay, stank-ass. personally effects unfortunately. countries control even NZ still dominates life, even daily press briefings testing rates state border quarantine - nowhere yesterdays news. California 40 million people. Texas 29 million. actually closer thought population wise.

I’m sure focus Texas probably something governor opening case numbers still growing. Total dick move. Never underestimate China Russia. 2016 Russia only. xi DT side. It’s scary actual fuck, read fucking book Thanks! know stupid question wanted double check. They're uncomfortable.

By way, doomers: got back first date. I’m medical school. She’s nurse. People healthcare hooking left right. That’s worried virus. Again, I'm aware.

But every time there's dire prediction Reddit simply extrapolating exponential growth, falls flat face.

There lots talk projected exponential growth COVID-19, [but seen sure hell 200k.

The current forecast 200K, they've certainly wildly wrong wave 1918 epidemic

Since COVID-19 flu, coronavirus, map trajectory based SARS MERS. Neither 2nd wave fortunately faded 8 months. same, COVID-19 mostly gone Oct problems rest life.

99% symptomatic patients recover short long-term complications. problems due severity symptoms co-morbidities. particular COVID-19, true estimate seems low me. They're wrong... Idk guy think they're full it.

Namely there's unprecedented spike Pneumonia attributed deaths would account somewhere 50 100% coronavirus deaths, considering average number Pneumonia deaths seen February normal year. Even everyone states suddenly go shelter place home leave food/emergencies cases would still rise foreseeable future, it’s nature virus takes hold. It’s something like 10 days symptoms start manifesting.

The companies reporting publicly basically small business. Local coffee shop, long post, store closed. Starbucks?

However, part return, they've instituted new rules. still hold meetings Google Meet we're limiting face face interactions. keep office doors closed, locked we're high traffic corridor. common areas stripped fun stuff make sure everyone stays socially distant (kitchen stripped snacks, seating taped off, etc).

Please stay safe, thank hard work, perseverance dedication fellow human great personal risk yourself. county tracking White, Black, Asian, Hispanic Other. I’m sure makes decisions tracking must county level.  don’t blame Americans. real blame lies national leadership didn’t formulate national plan didn’t use spotlight sell country keep overtly scratching hair mutter ""God damned fleas!"" frequently.  clothing store mixed climate area would go business constantly winterwear, right? they'd remember starts get cold stock up.  


Dumb analogy know American exceptionalism thing. According some, nothing learn nobody. Fauci gets much slack. claims work yet countries successfully it. Yes. literally think solution is. Freedumbers. long take symptoms show? bridges 👍 Yes! thought weeks ago. research found majority people got polio either didn’t symptoms mild symptoms. know happened people weren’t lucky... 

I told someone day might start calling virus “new polio” draw attention crippling going on. [Accidents kind #3 leading cause death interesting see final count accidents 2020 compare against. peak “cases time” graph. That’s numbers look like cases backdated based initial symptoms. conveniently don’t reference line “bars, nightclubs, restaurants reopened” (June 1st) “restaurant capacity limits lifted” (June 16th). looking like we'll breach 50k today, like 55-60k Friday. Europe 13k today, joke. 20 others quarantined birthday barbecue became potential vector spread disease.

Who thought party ok? I'm victim blaming considering entire state department varying levels restrictions months, somebody must _approved_ party, no? pretty much airlines said looking FAA provide mandates/guidelines dealing Covid? 

To put perspective - Czech Republic *349* deaths population 10 million.

That 0.000349% population. means ever 100,000 people, 3.5 people died.

The statistical possibility choking sandwich celebrating bridge higher dying C-19. Define excess capacity? always need buffer, think empty rooms, underutilized facilities excess staff compared US? Broadly speaking, much excess capacity - treasuries exactly overflowing coin right now, save money health care broadly returning political topic. 
In Belgium we've hard hit covid, even though numbers bit skewed since count covid deaths broadly countries e.g. inlcude deaths 'likely' contributed COVID. One thing help us though comparatively large ICU capacity - still rushed increase capacity. also stopped 'elective surgery' covid patients totally seperated 'ordinary' patients. think matter capacity system overwhelmed, advance health care system kind reserve resources (if trained staff bottleneck). also deceptive, exponential-like growth appear good like things control peak hits. Lombardy Italy rich advanced region strong health care system, still collapsed.  
I'm sure falls labels 'primary, urgent, emergency etc..' special system place covid would skip going regular/primary doctor instead went directly triage posts, get tested scanned etc. people could sit home situation worsened risk patient etc. would go hospital. Apart also regular emergency circuit ambulance. Exactly, every state rules, states infections thought free clear open up. allowed pockets covid-19 survive come back raging second lockdown measures opened up. states contract tracing, not- what’s point effort lower cases one state infected person another state easily drive start new outbreak? planning try second month. not? Can’t go anywhere anyway. Whatever works not, they'll 2 billion doses it. They'll destroy doesnt work. Ahhh sucks. kinda funny also thinking meeting couple friends soon lol
I may put hold now. Newest death 89 year old female. diabetes hypertension.

She died 5 days hospitalized, 8 days diagnosed.

She died way ICU

On hand, random mass testing Pavas district ruled community transmission 4.5% test came positive. Interns first week emergency intubations, lucky might get one mainly get decide dose Tylenol give floor patients. rusty said. I've never better place life. wife financially stable, I've gotten trying times, although everything perfect, least we're set okay. Buckle down, think strategically worry health well being. can't imagine still going struggles top. Feel lucky good place amoung bad. people hurting bad. back reason recommending masks was... economics, lol. It’s measurement success that’s difficult. time consuming. needs properly balanced enormous ethical concerns. “lol inject proteins” suspiciously absent GCP guidance. 

And wording fine. Thanks though. say admitting President Trump’s response failure. good job wouldn’t say this. wish would play straight. 

On hand, elective surgeries trying protect important bottom line. sister elective surgery postponed three months (just earlier week). constant opioids walk reconstructive surgery ankle. That's know feds let anything actually bad happen companies. economy reality still much fucked. think seen ""bars"" look like. music venues, people dancing close together, breathing heavily etc. strip clubs concert venues. God damn agree Mitch McConnell. Fuck 2020. hope so. government needs keep borders closed keep us americans out. crazy here.  mention bleach discoloring upholstery. wants sued cost replacing car backseat wanted ride airport home? I’ll show mine show yours. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* infected Florida, know ""dumb wanna be"" state  nobody gonna wear face shield unless they're working. Yes enforceable. can't force someone quarantine traveling within USA. That's really motivation, that's indifference. need expend us I'm asking? Invade Quebec! Teach freedom! Oh thank God, completely ignore /s. 40% Americans overweight, huge problem, study done 4 years ago. Pre-existing condition not, young people getting virus. There's reason downplay it. One person completely powerless enough keep safe? explains lot. We're pulling 40k like nothing, even weekends. broad dismissal ignores fact many droplet dispersal YouTube videos created scientists universities. Scientists also interviewed videos. European here. comment sums view US pretty well.
Here nobody wears masks, infection levels low getting lower, nobody demands others wear masks hospital-billing. GO MASS. Build wall around state name New New England Yeah, since 2000. Also, old rule, towns bordering states within 10 miles could sell Sundays could open. grew town barely met 10 mile rule, town like ""go to"" town ppl living closer Boston. didnt hit NH. old rule 12p 6p times. Premature say ending Europe.

1. Fall yet here
2. Cases declining still dependent masks restrictions

Most Europe likely wind much better state, mostly open except bars/clubs/crowds, still heavy restrictions vaccine distributed. Student loans actually discharge death. Companies drag hell prove will. number years life lost wartime death ~50. Accidents like Chernobyl Bhopal may caused reduction individual life expectancy outright lives taken.

By comparison years life lost per covid death quite low, everyone assumes survive lost years life. science extremely limited, however. [the study mentioned AFAIK never passed peer review (it may completely ignoring comorbidities). nobody idea survivors measurable reduction individual life expectancy quality. Eventually get information Lombardy Sweden. work healthcare data analytics access almost every hospital system’s emr. won’t let data faked. Cases tested/found earlier now. March, pretty much admitted hospital get test probably 2 weeks ventilator 2 dead (on death-track scenario). 

Now get test get tickle throat small fever allergies. cool, except we're catching cases 2-3 weeks hospitalization. 3-4 week lagging indicator 6-7 week lagging indicator. 

Also, we've recognized elderly, well truly fucked get it. Every grandma grandpa independent living nursing care locked tight. really dramatic 1:12 1:6 IFR patients pretty much pool. across spectrum deaths we've taken away 3/4 deaths, gone 3% overall fatality rate less 1%. Combine many 50 60 year olds totally cool *not* going bars just-in-case even skew statistics. 

The ""problem"" Covid effects wildly non-uniform. get hard matter 20s 30s 40s, world hurt could looking months years recovery - ever. chance 1:200 1:300? young, sure. seem bad. Certainly bad enough put life hold, right - mean, gotta die someday? Everybody gets flu people die. Except compare death rates young influenza - 20-40 set - get something closer 1:10,000. Covid Ebola, we'd much uniform response people judge 70% chance dying much worse 1:10000 chance. 1:300 1:10000 feels pretty much average person. Y'all, governor trying kill you. Man, idk album recommend, they're really good.

Horse Soldier! Horse Soldier! pretty cool, quite call concept album lot songs deal military history. opener banger.

I really like Hair Eyes Like Highland Steer Things Can't Undone well. Cabin Fever also great. came new album last week that's really good although listened enough times yet.

I guess go release order lol, kind cool way hear growth musician. sure intelligent enough understand this, random stuff exists concept gets patented time Meanwhile, husband seriously considering moving another country, lol. That's completely false. Take probably ask refund whatever fake law degree have. completely agree! I'm central FL little social-distancing mask wearing happening. governor like, ""deal it- gotta make $$$"". government whole also ready over. mortality rate way though Spain press saying cost 2000€. generic guess boat, least, going paid healthcare. Ah country California. eat oatmeal politicians sending us deaths market dip.

And lot news outlets actively downplaying pandemic order convince confuse people safer is. wore shirt pants cover body, everyone complies without second thought. let’s cover germ bacteria infested part bodies hell breaks loose.  Gu  That's fine. see bars closed good faith manner governors Texas Florida particular. right thing wrong reasons. think closing bars people social distancing bars. think closing bars ensure least amount blow back. Thanks man - thanks empathetic. great reddit forum, full people really care. hope make this, alive mostly unscathed. This.  Shame! attend. downvoted you. wanted know. wrong. People downplay virus obesity. pulling 50%+ from? laborforce participation rate 50%. Basically, ages 18 65, 50% people currently jobs. wife went (small) funeral someone came contact tested positive. Funeral Saturday let us know tested positive today.

It’s me, wife 4 month old (4 month old stayed grandparents, didn’t attend funeral).

Anything besides 14 day isolation/quarantine? called pediatrician go get tested tomorrow want to.

How worried be? anxiety newborn, course. They're projecting fall school would session. California starting fresh, bigger surge cases now, really think town untouched 3 4 months? feeling here. I’m terrified year turn like 2016. Considering vast majority infections mild, get something reduces severity point COULD compared flu would say would enough get us crisis Protesters go bathroom? pull mask way take drink water? wear mask incorrectly? mention protest crowds often extremely densely packed, large majority yelling/chanting generates massive levels airborne viral particulates.

You can't attack people spreading virus going beach, pretend massive protests equal greater effect spreading virus. fully support motivations behind protests, protests undoubtedly significant contribution current trend cases, even cases confirmed via testing data. Wow sucks 😥 shit. illegal? need preserved front line health care workers. Instead telling public make own, instead told us didn’t work. motivation expendable. Yikes hope least give answer soon, hard live uncertainty still focus studying.


Good luck LSAT!! unsolicited advice: study hard trust hard work put test day. something learned law school wish knew before. fine! Government needs emphasise cannot family gatherings 10 people. tired seeing 25 members one family get Covid two five die, visiting. 

We need cancel 4th. Sorry dude, partner industry covid hit still work, blows. love bars that's me, def mad respect workers industry. Best luck r/agedlikemilk Man I’ve debates trump lovers everyone I’ve discussed things thin-skinned babies. I’m sure expected really sensitive beliefs opinions get questioned. haven’t explained peak 2 weeks protests. that, you’re one looks like fucking idiot, kiddo, sorry say. Russian bounties US soldiers? 

Teehee Kaepernick though?!?! I’m serious say this. may rebel secede. federal government goddamn broken. 130k Americans dead force something, anything, happen it’s wispy silence sound money counting machines running background

When puts people work months months we’re going see increased unrest. rich would well govern country fashion rather run away bank fast can. money matters countries let matter Funny bring up. don’t think ones US all. 

I still struggling understand people US always thing contracting disease better vaccine side effects less severe ailment stock market would care? read article all? Travelers required quarantine, that’s “restriction” part. Canada, 37 million residents. whats going Texas? worldometers shows nearly 8,000 new cases.....1point3acres shows +4581.....Texas dashboard shows +6975.... Italy use wartime triage. patient likely survive gets treatment. sure news watching, definitely liberal minorities losing shit wearing mask 20 minutes. beautiful Globally, 513K died. put perspective, that's bit entire population Atlanta, GA. Colonel Mustard, say? Even were, like could follow advice ""buy month ago"" lol. think clear. Healthcare provider here...the accuracy comment made cry. 100% take. I’m exhausted, emotionally &amp; physically. started therapy month ago toll taken me. coworker going uncles funeral tomorrow, died COVID. One patients quarantine 5 family members tested positive COVID 2 week period, 2 died result. Another nurse work lost 2 family members COVID. family practice within 10 miles work quarantined CDC every staff member tested positive. morning, go gas station &amp; see 4 people without masks &amp; became mandatory last week. turned around &amp; walked out. I’m exhausted &amp; scared &amp; angry...I cannot imagine healthcare system look like 100k cases/day... KHN investigation found least 35 healthcare workers died Osha received safety complaints workplaces. Yet 21 June, agency quietly closed almost complaints, none led citation fine. 1,300 healthcare-related Covid-19 complaints remain open 275 fatality investigations continuing, according public records.   
  complaint logs, made public, show thousands desperate pleas workers seeking better protective gear hospitals, medical offices nursing homes.... Probably scale human suffering would create would unprecedented modern developed world. Entire industries gone forever, unemployment scale never seen country, mass homelessness, infrastructure collapse, collateral deaths people access health care insurance job, exacerbated fact roof head means put food bellies, etc. mental health implications come along it, sociological/cultural/societal impact comes along that. Basically, cascade failure.

The sad part resources multi-year lockdown really wanted to, would require transformation legislative government level simply time for, collective willpower (currently) put motion immediate future. entire country would restructured accommodate it, we'd agree would essentially amount ""government intervention"" ""handouts"", half country views tyranny dirty word. None happens fast. Death rates declining across country There’s also notion “making money” too. he? Isn’t he? quite sure given moment. breaking records day day

Tired winning yet? No, absolutely still would have. Got it, thanks info really interesting. fucked. Sorry. 40% cases Texas reported last 2 weeks. surprising many died yet. recovered either. [discussed Texas Coronavirus thread. Thanks! appreciate answer. Stay safe ! mean fair keeping stadium shut much easier getting every person flung around state wear mask. can't get everyone wear mask mean try to, crack possible to. plan supporting millions unemployed homeless month? small businesses forced close due spent tons resources trying reopen state guidelines closed again? Nah, everything supportable long essential workers still slaving away deliver Chipotle front door! post billboard somewhere lol trend since March.  Texan here... frustrated position watching happen leaders absolutely nothing. Even sadder neighbors coworkers seem think joke. really hope that’s parents live, they’re highest risk group (over 60, existing medical conditions). Even still allowing family visit them, family don’t trust taking necessary precautions otherwise. Science said would happen happened, yet absolute concrete evidence still enough people. think Covid overtake New York fucked? Yeah, hard ""disagree"" one. friend car accident, girlfriend 12 years (living together 10 years) allowed ICU. Family members only. nurse could let through, could get trouble caught anyone complained. 

Then there's couple common law partners, married. One died, get financial aid provided widows/widowers country. married people get one.

As lawyer friend told me, everything goes well there's difference; get married case something goes wrong.

In countries, acquire rights married couple years cohabitation couple. others, don't. important aware things.

I glad, however, people get married if/when/because want to, external pressure.  That's wondering. worried unreasonable order would get people riled up, seems that's case. put money pot try get COVID. Whoever gets COVID first gets pot. makes sense,"" McKinstry said. ""They're intentionally it. They're taking seriously.""

What fuck Alabama?!? Well, let’s hope there’s enough money pot cover hospital bills. won’t be, let’s hope Speaking hard find, isopropyl alcohol nowhere found. least find tp now, although short-lived, alcohol remains unicorn product. Sounds like extra deaths people wearing masks dying breathing c02 15 minutes grocery store. 

Big Mask covering up. always need definitive proof take precautions. think we'll get accident, people still wear seatbelts. 1.5% running total April June 30, even give last month data isolated April/May data, it’s

171-110=61 positive IgG serology results
11,010-7,270=3740 tests

= 0.8% positive June. Again; I’m saying San Diego county 0.8% positive serology (or 1.5% seen overall since April), that’s tests have. covid activity south county away hospitals though. Although several hundred covid positive patients dozens deaths. It’s gotten worse businesses failed follow reopening guidelines people bothered wear masks. knew viral spread would continue reopening, degree. reality, administration stuck rock hard place. made decision, shit didn’t pan envisioned, are. didn’t stop Lyft driver Monday morning refusing wear mask “constitutional rights.” Understatement day mate Galveston hour Houston. fair, one side ignored it. glad job relocated block live since lockdown started. scares me. things unevitably start get unacceptable governors already late take action turn things around. virus already spread exponentially cases hospitalizations reach astronomical figures. lack creative imagination something like happening.

Warnings enough, states apparently experience horrifying events take virus seriously... try get COVID?

I’m imagining bunch stupid boys trying get stupid girls orgy party claiming it’s actually COVID party. He's modern day Edison. expect 200,000-300,000 deaths 2020 elections. I'm Black. us. Easy fake news spread amongst illiterate population like India. people still believe guy infected HIV spat Coke bottles lol. Numbers didn’t skyrocket everything opened back up. absolutely supportable. What’s graph supposed show us? course testing per thousand people fucking Portugal, greater population. 

Doesn’t change fact many places (especially south) testing hard find, it’s free, lockdowns, couldn’t get test unless hospitalized unless came contact confirmed case (at least, Texas).

Now federal testing closed, we’ll even less.  dad immune (for least months) cannot spread (since recovered) current conduct little less awful sounds. also lonely lost wife denial reason died. Get speak therapist please. DOH limit it, company limits it. Roche, case, decides country gets number kits, clients within country get many kits. anywhere long enough use restroom. Yeah seen data pile evictions comming? act going late many people. Lol exactly say so.

--u/dumdadumdumdumdmmmm 10 month old syndrome, heart defects, already needs breathing treatments. makes mad see parents taking deep breath relief children healthy nothing worry - including sister law keeps wanting us come birthday parties, etc.  ROLLTIDE That’s spirit!   bomb ...are telling Canuck USA might entirely truthful lying?

\*shocked Pikachu face maple syrup\* Appreciate response! 
If government bailout banks car companies, feel like definitely stepped plate helped small businesses too. 

The country trillions dollars debt. never going debt. don’t understand government also using resources house, feed, support displaced affected virus. 

There people’s well beings!! I’m tired sad. could happened? Wait, *with* Georgia's bullshit backdating reporting too? so, holy shit. That's living stupid, unreasoning fear. time closing shit down. time people responsible. Businesses exist whim governments.

I theater three times last couple weeks. number people time including three, three, five. dangerous? evidence somewhere? fucked true Another, really clear indicator we're undercounting increased cardiac arrest. 

Chances surviving cardiac arrest 
6% cardiac arrest occurs outside hospital
24% cardiac arrest occurs April reported cardiac arrest rates New York increased 800%. 

http://www.ptca.org/news/2020/0408_INCREASED_DEATHS_NYC.html here, time, products available us gotten dramatically better. would encourage people least try vegetarian meals. afraid cook, maybe try couple Amy's meals see like them. I'm concerned hospitals get they’re saying they’ll open now, things keep exploding like can’t see happening. regular schools, NFL season, hell NBA NHL supposed resume later month. 

Serious question, university held legally accountable push forward opening turn severe hotspot? college kid forced pay tens thousands year education *and* forced place COVID going huge risk I’d pissed ""Where heart attacks gone?"" Report Sharp Decline Patient Visits Heart Attack, Stroke Cancer Care COVID-19 Pandemic"" Anybody else notice Rob Ford comeback dead comment coronavirus?
I guess typo... Oh no, apple stores closed.... Heaven help us... else spend obscene amounts money mediocre technology... Ahhhhh..... OMFG like also said pretty much police stop anybody stuff supposedly there's statute limitations crime South Carolina degree need take fair share global pool reagents test kits suppliers. also many people process tests. likely combo massive spike overwhelming available resources lack overcome issue. 

Whatever reasn, 15% positivitity appalling horrfying. needs happen Texas asap. Restaurants packed here. I’m speaking whole families, mothers babies strollers eating fucking Torchys. 1 LeBron James? I'm never Facebook, know got from.

Edit: read comment wrong.

Your talking previous vaccination?
Again I'm totally vaccination, many proved safe form immunizing. Live Columbus Ohio. Looks like half people stores open faced. I've complaining work employees wearing masks stupid nose nonsense. that's come heard shit talked know I'm around. Shits gonna get better unless Dewine mandates masks instead suggesting them. high risk individual terrifying. SARS-cov2 defected Brazil waste water months ago. mean virus spreading unnoticed? mean death rate / go undetected. That's fantastic too. grocery store. weeks DEATH get official takes time, sometimes weeks, doctors fill death certificates health officials adjudicate deaths. finally added official state important note take several weeks death records submitted National Center Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, tabulated.

So ""lol"" want, know talking about. Damn Texas, please safe live provide evidence virus spread outdoors? not, provide evidence far virus transmitted people? there's evidence, arguing convenience. Seems poor taste 130,000 people died. bright side potential lower percentage mortality rate, no? know health department signs bathrooms restaurants remind employees legally required wash hands returning work use restroom?

Those things around ages yet I've never heard anybody complaining rights would taken away freedom eat burger prepared guy poop hands. random opinion sub already US centric is, add politics would way worse become national sub. Plus nasty stuff always comes political discussion, prefer keeping politics much possible, subs that. Uber provide anything drivers besides window sticker and, now, limited supply face masks. driver shell $$ partition. think hit depression. misinformation trolls always hit extremes. seem going waves hitting one issue. Today ""shut everything forever"". Tomorrow it'll back ""IFR 0.4%"" it'll back ""death rate increased"". I'm sure numbers, change depending feelings, goal I'd suggest comparing similarly accurate country like Switzerland Denmark, long-range comparisons especially ubiquitous ""Xth worst world"" claims pointless countries report barely quarter real death toll (look excess death graphs Peru Ecuador see particularly egregious example). best bro! Btw im nz ahaha.  Years overload? invected every healthy person 30 next 3 months likely reach 60% without overloading system. Admittedly, that's exactly herd immunity works, see problem letting younger healthier people lead charge building herd immunity. quite obvious outbreak hit school system like deer hit train.
There never ""what if"" plan drawn school b(maybe government, probably hide fallout shelter plan 1960)
Anyhow. know children families boat op.
IMHO safe way provide majority needed services directly. risk child directly interact infected instructor opposite.
The safest course action parents gain necessary skills needed help children. 1k week, kind wear tear car though? Gas, tires, oil, whole nine yards. Consider every mile put car around .57 cents.

""the fixed variable costs operating automobile, including depreciation, insurance, repairs, tires, maintenance, gas, oil."" get information call people sub ""coronadoomers"" ... bad news, want it. suck. Whether health, finances, both, people suffering unless one lucky ones reliable permanent wfh job accumulated wealth. Even lot wfh people miserable different way. long, I'm afraid. seatac raised min wage business owners said would force raise prices 2%.

2% 50% pay bump? I'd pay that.

Labor ever shrinking cost even heavy labor industries. U first honestly haunting American school children still tough US best country world, amount Patriotic propaganda able blind people far US fallen behind first world nations, even Covid. half population still sadly.   I’m guessing meant batik quilting fabric tighter cotton weave first talked NYT article. Also good quilting cotton cheap. LOL older sisters listen you? Mine certainly doesnt. Trust me. dont condone it. qualify unemployment that's job. Hypothetically speaking. news??? even interest patio dining that's that's open Ontario. me, people r/conspiracy generally hate reddit? Definitely getting vibe. PA? I’m thinking nursing idk voted Jill Stein.  What's up, fellow Georgian! easier fool someone rightly convince someone they're fooled. think Covid related still lol Same. Saw 10 pack amazon. look dumb reusable respirator go big go home. like site TBF really sunny Florida... that's good... Nobody would allowed COVID. :( keep wearing masks we’ll alright Absolutely. think time period beginning pandemic binary choice lives livelihood.

It's amazing selfish culture become. concept ""wear mask protect others yourself"" get people culture. I've never ashamed call American. 

The economy always recover, shutdown not, human lives never recovered. It’s crazy see difference approaches different countries. Australia dealing outbreak one state. 250 new cases past days. 36 suburbs locked 30 days. door knocked 54,000 houses test people suburbs contract trace everyone infected. [im going leave You’re thinking federal government’s power limited constitution. Look 10th amendment. Powers granted federal government reserved states. long constitution forbid it, state government make law it. New Jersey. I’d say virtually one stores without mask since mid-March. 10% wear mask covering mouth nose? Yes. ridiculous even despite approach working Someone idea pay relief rest year shut lot shit America point, one cares anymore hysteria run course. think entire country shut down, real, 6 weeks. thing would become manageable like everywhere else  corona love ☺️ US wait, there's more! *Introduce new swine flu pandemic* Who? makes happy. son made 200 cotton masks donated hoping would help. know help lot! US become Anne. fund isolation program resulting reality TV revenues. NH native here, don’t want move time winter, trust me. Unless really like snow freezing cold. feel pain- family SC we’re worried them. It’s good idea, way 2020 going, probably won’t happen. OMG. Cat butthole mouth. never unsee. Almost didn’t want post whole obesity comments come articles. Rand Paul get Coronavirus tell another till week later? 

Fuck guy shithole!  I’ll nearly full bus Montreal take work I’ll one maybe 4 5 people wearing mask, don’t worry Americans, stupid simply shows that, american great movies one top country world doesnt automatically make good everything..they could worse everything too...i guess actually zombie outbreak happened, probably US country affected most..zombie apocalypse probably happened there, rest world especially asia. No, make assumptions joke. Assumptions big part conspiracy theories. Anyone read history shocked people power do...love melodramatic last sentence though. Till get genocide I'm shocked anything people do. awfully weird objection man who's largely known voting everything. politicians that. faster figure out, better Long Thanks Fish!!! Agreed, make sacrifices one way another. short indefinite lockdown (which think untenable) must degree opening up.

If degree opening up, numbers going rise. questions isn’t whether will-they are. 

So good numbers? That’s need know. decided acceptable balance say, total complete quarantine, letting everybody anything want willy nilly?

So yes, saying numbers without context tells nothing. Unless prevent anybody going anywhere, numbers always going baseline.

I dunno, read comment don’t really disagree it, yet seemed disagree I’m sure why. 

Is way phrased way would phrase what? Arizona fucked really least crazy ""conspiracy"" theory ever. Given current administration, sounds completely believable. perfectly honest? 

I again. looks like that. Maaaa, time's Brooons on?! Kinda wrong everyone around here.

Like actually understand mother would upset. truly best follow rules kids faces covered, think denying service wrong. course can't tell kids video.

Needless say, angry response WAY top. ""Discriminated"" certainly correct word using. Videotaping first place posting psycho. get it, worked retail many moons ago couldn’t even imagine age mega Karens, video recording everywhere add corona mix lol. also agree shouldn’t fired, saying move mask pull particular end likely got screwed. 

I still laughed, here’s hoping works get much better job somewhere. Also yes, mother one infuriating idiot I’m willing bet (unfortunately) poor employees probably deal shit multiple times daily US know graduate school attend that's connected medical school waited last minute require mask city forced it. Masks mandatory TTC July 2nd. Saturday though, lot workplaces observing 3rd holiday. That's probably meant guess idea death rate say, 50s? really like jaanuu ones.
Tie bar I’m intrigued worked like that. 

Usually persons nursing already considerate others Thank you. people need go work us mask wearing workers they'll suddenly fine wearing 20 minutes forced pay anything, voluntary. saying idea whats actually going risk everything migrate. 

Got it! People leave house clothed mostly. Dude, I'm fucking 30, agree trying say, patronizing fuck refer young adults millennials kids/children. “Looks cancerous” Mitch? don’t say. call bs one. 9740 4.4% daily jump. governor reported TV 6/30 cases number 5898. number true, that's 60% jump. BS source. That’s intriguing

This LA? Could give approximate date location? figure unit that. wouldn’t surprised. live outside Cleveland neighborhood swarming. neighbors groups house parties usually week, always tons people hanging right top restaurant patios. stopped going walks sidewalks full certain times day.

Edit: oh barely masks. Usually people wearing aren’t correctly.  Phase III ""is better alternatives""

Currently benchmark vaccine (at least US) [50% (to prevent, decrease severity). reasonable starting point would presumably transform pandemic something akin bad flu season Critical political positions minimum requirements include basic college-level science biology courses. call bs one. 9740 4.4% daily jump. governor reported TV 6/30 cases number 5898. number true, that's 60% jump. BS source. People don’t want gaslighted want consistent rules. think there's vaccine yet. Same!! Plus fact tons wealthy world governments scientists examine Oxford’s data began manufacturing risk. American government, British, various European, Indian, etc. That’s fact makes confident vaccine. It’s around two months. I’ve see (anecdotal) neither passenger diver wearing masks. Unless he’s duty shuttles wife around like Driving Miss Daisy. nothing see here. Par course. 

I add this, Vegas, wait times gone minutes 30-60 minted get ride. talking friends drive, sitting may never go back see Covid driving huge risk r/G4SwineFlu I'm talking Florida Department Health providing instrumentation Florida's hospitals. awful small businesses. is. people can’t grow fuck adhere guidelines, specifically mask wearing, choice force stay home. didn’t like this. people think they’re immune it’s “just flu” 130K people dead 2.7M infected numbers going like crazy. It’s terrible small businesses alternative millions die. south stay fucking south New Zealand opened everything zero cases weeks. one harshest lockdowns outside Asia, closed everything except grocery stores pharmacies 5 weeks slow cautious re-opening, built strong testing contact tracing program, restriction people coming (14 day mandatory quarantining plus two tests) mean, depends entirely go south. Unethical laws terrible justification pedophilia that's interesting bold stance make, Sandusky. People losing homes, losing ability feed family. getting treatment need. able afford health insurance.

But hey, atleast survived covid... right? literally cites journal articles used way advertisement.

What sources consider ok? News organizations sell advertising? different. 

Get high horse actually click link read references literature. would disagree lot. Bars core human socializing almost millennium. tried true format point. God hope. see many muncipalities enforcing this. think best bet large majority public band together call people out. LA heart working class city diverse city 10% wealthy stupid Prague too, since one affected areas. fair big uptick localized outbreaks rather across Republic thing.

Here Brno almost like nothing happening. sequence virus they've found? reward countries tanking economy making sure people relatively safe, give place flagrantly violated protocol cases? sounds like argument fuck next pandemic comes ""a vaccine eventually made get since worst hit then"", race bottom counting total COVID infections mortality lower, correct? POTS comes along ME/CFS dysautonomia post-viral fatigue. talk covid gives people ME/CFS [I idea get ridiculous idea like  Tell every western country except USA  town protests end May increase cases outside nursing home. Bars reopened 2 weeks ago seeing huge increase every day.

So either bars something incubation month instead 5-14 days. Incoming twitter meltdown Oompa Loompa 3...2...1... think Houston total. I’m rolling IFR 0.5-1.0% (that includes asymptomatic cases). CDC posted 0.26% potential, nothing based actual numbers. antibody testing we’ve done points falling somewhere range. 

Just students don’t die, doesn’t mean don’t long term health consequences. You’re also ignoring students give professors students give residents community. direct consequences bringing back college towns might one hospital, that’s big problem. 

New normal whether want believe not. couldn’t control outbreak get go, we’ll wearing masks rolling form social distancing vaccine. That’s reality, whether want believe not. Ill give u 2 guesses Yes, that’s good question. 

The Swedish government however called “discrimination” accuses nordics creating “deep wounds” “worry” long wounds stay us Nordic cooperation damaged. various pundits: “I don’t know ever go Denmark “travel expert” thinks Danes don’t get decide Swedish people allowed travel... sound pretty angry me. 

But wether represent broad public unsure about. friends certainly don’t share level anger understand Denmark keeping borders shut general tourism... live echo chambers degree. Well heard Mr. Young sing her. Right. borders group psychosis, pretty astonishing watch. icu capacity.

When space put covid patients space treat normal critical care illnesses (MI, stroke, sepsis, Trauma, etc) Covids choke, drop dead. Vaccinate pigs, stop source. ridiculous wait happen say, told so. something. 

Edit: give meds combat it. OR... something ... Pig Distancing 😄 Musk pulled complete 180 virus. First went made free ventilators hospitals. flipped script said bullshit. assumption 100% pleasing Trump. Got keep Space Force NASA contracts. Trump gets mad, push contracts go elsewhere. think Trump taking seriously, Musk would continued virus.

 However, SpaceX government contractor gets keep working Tesla not. Tesla needs 4 straight quarters profit order get S&amp;P 500 announced he's going barely make every car company going announce big loss. 

His motivations money conspiracy whatever. know happens next Tesla. call shareholders oust CEO actions regarding outbreak vote large bonus successful quarter. doubt happen people absolutely love regardless. Lots things Congress force withholding federal funds. That's got back 21 nationwide drinking age, got (for while) 55 mph national speed limit. States really need highway funds, holding back safety issues big stick. said, states would complied coordinated federal response COVID-19. State governors looking direction CDC. Instead, CDC told ""shut up"" one official tanked stock market late February. much I’d love US actually care it’s citizens, global pandemic isn’t exactly good time tear entire system rebuild. isn’t going happen I’m holding breath. agree. feel bad them... nothing else do. source that? Let rephrase: controlled openings indoor venues goal. Bar restaurant settings, multiple dozens people come night, perfect breeding ground virus.

Controlled spread US must after, seeing right now.

So movie theater 3-5 people problem. bars indoor venue 100+ people. 

I agree though, can't live fear. need responsible smart this. average 500 miles/week usually 
Have fill twice week usually $50-$60 me
Oil change month car amount miles 
Got tires changed unrelated use even using changing every 6 months spent $80 
I’d probably spend $100-$200 maintance reliable Honda Accord 2006 205,000 miles still runs almost like new 
Plus write costs tax season following year don’t even pay much taxes it’s easiest money I’ve ever made Thanks man, work lot older dudes say isn’t good country anymore list comes pretty often. 

As older country fan like? try Gus Clark? must fake, too.

I hope need /s. FYI, least Texas, unemployment longer requires job searches order receive benefits Ignorance Bliss. lot people know rather clueless assuming covid history due reopening. It’s they’re defiant much naivety some. people don’t really research busy living lives. really highlighting need proper leadership. Ok first all, report *just* came shows many states (TX, AZ, CA etc) likely undercounting COVID deaths right now. 

Second off, even they’re not, chirp two weeks cases *and* hospitalizations reaching record highs last weeks? Guess comes next friend, goes Cases Hospitalizations Deaths order. 

Idiots mentalities like 100% reason we’re mess can’t nice things. Outdoor dining well? seems going fine NY.  Thousands Texans getting sick day Lt. Gov says, ""No thank Dr. Fauci.""

When people realize suits give fuck us? They're prioritizing wealth health.  lot professors vulnerable age group.

It would tragedy died probably accumulated decades advanced scientific experience would hard replace. Buy bidets now- never want go back. property? decided it? Powerful white people did, ain't giving social distancing masks slows transmission diseases There’s probably going one approved vaccine, benchmark going 50% efficacy (reduces transmission 50% better rate placebo). I’m hopeful number companies achieve this, single company anywhere near manufacturing capacity required make enough doses whole world. business issue people's behaviors within, wearing masks. Businesses exist whim governments, going close them, need pay operating expenses outside paychecks. 

This living stupid fear; that's is. Yeah, I've already walked away Tesla purchase next car I've sold shares company. think idea sound company lot room growth, erratic person helm they're never going realize actual potential. Feel bad bar owners, good lord nothing less important functioning society bar mean objectively stupid thing do, one “deserves” virus. lady behind grocery store today. wearing masks creeping closer cart. moved front cart loudly told keep distance. said am. sure learned measurements, 2 ft 6.
These freaking people getting nerves. badly want accidentally, ram shopping cart them. Sometimes need step back remember stupidity part non mask, results confrontation put jail. (Especially since everything year upside down.) Texan (I'm FL Man) feel exactly way. makes god damn angry especially things know work slow spread. Like super slow moving car accident powerless over. *lower* Michigan? 

Say yah da U.P. eh?! Texas Medical Center includes hospitals following counties: Austin, Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, Waller. It’s big area. Enter Mothman accomplish what? Protests anything game already rigged hope type thing happen USA...
/s women pay dowries India anymore? curious. population density much higher. Dr. Zijian Chen, medical director new Center Post-Covid Care Mount Sinai Health System

You know much death rate hospitals create centers specifically help recovering disease. matter testing slowing, either supplies politics. problem fact Florida Government everything (considerable) power speed up. Apathy? Ignorance? Denial?

There exactly one reason would accept. Circumstances outside control fighting rectify.

But aren't. arguing dragging feet. Floridians need remember next election cycle. Governor. Mayor's, city councils, fracking home owners associations.

Vote out. Got out. say? Cases nearly doubled starting 2 days chart ends. They've since doubled again.

We know takes 2-14 days infection hospitalization happen, longer still death.

This governor recently pulled back reopening. Within 2 weeks number hospitalizations likely 2-4x now. would likely lead increase deaths ideal conditions, unfortunately oncoming deluge patients happen time hospitals already capacity supplies stretched thin. “almost certainly”? Multiple tests samples used. article huge question mark right now.  dude clearly disabled. BMI 25 puts threshold healthy overweight. barely wear mask guy 400lbs. puts BMI 45 easily. There's way wear one without passing crashing. probably oxygen steering vehicle alone might strenuous even without mask. period thought CDC's February 25th communication single best communication , one best communications, government managed put out. Blunt honest. recent going spread control also really good. undercounting deaths covid, mortality rate higher, lower appears.

Edit: rather, depends whether people ever counted covid positive, recorded covid related deaths. think General rule is. u sick u worry all. Cos u stay inside alone. 

If u yet sick. technically could increase amount virus buildup. 
But u get little ore lot non factor cos u fume way u it. u lay u pillow 8h u fume ure trip shop mask.

:Edit spelling mistake People may like done. Probably done sooner better late never. Yep considering posting definition ghoul here. makes several good points though. would wonder light larger number people going issues bought Covid would like reassess figure person getting sick costing economy $55k? people minor cases Covid truly lost half lung capacity life would suggest number low. agree, lot businesses, either open risk citation go bankrupt stay closed go bankrupt.

They go ""open"" every time. far tell, penalties civil / fines, lose? Thanks article! think doesn’t make much sense though. Batik (it sounds like know this, I’m saying non-sewers) decorative technique gives characteristic result. local fabric shop, often rayon content well. would certainly guess article didn’t specify batik meant batik think there’s reason relevant distinction clarify. fact, go back read carefully, think paragraph list three different things, quilter cotton batik items 1 2 list, same. 

No offense quilting cotton. wish suitable purposes, designs often really attractive. Perhaps it’s cheap absolute terms, it’s certainly cheap relative fabrics including cottons— $5.99 really cheap 9.99 11.99 local shop. thread count also much low end cotton wovens.

Did see article subreddit recently? [Review mask  Interesting mention silks, though seem treat “silk” “chiffon” two necessarily distinct categories.

Bottom line, masks good, though better others, wear damn mask, like sew, it’s fun useful great times like this. situation NJ now? East Bay. incredible different SF versus surrounding counties. Walnut Creek, Lafayette, Concord: everyone socializing friends, neighbors, families mask. Contra Costa county huge increases infected, maybe half people completely gave social distancing. Even worst times month two back, thousands people went shopping, spend hours Target, bringing kids hang Target.  

We seriously screwed Bay Area nothing changes, see state county governments anything half people giving social distancing. Also, kids? gave meeting large groups seeing friends now. virus massively spreads county.  

Only really bad many dying state county governments something.  hip new way altitude training :) Oh tables tuned 1918 pandemic countries allowed police shoot without masks. slightly good news today's totals. plot daily change 7-day rolling average new cases. increasing means every day new cases increasing, increase worse day before. looking possibly formed peak plateau. means expect new cases climb while, could begin decelerate may longer exponential growth. Fingers crossed see difference continue fall.

And it’s even difficult do. That’s really hit home me.....never ashamed call American. Sadly, couldn’t agree more. americans would rather die becoming like canada. fact, already are.. Americans literally squandered 3 months time half baked policies eventually led us back square 1. 

I understand America. guys worried second wave, never really flattened first one. like one continuous wave.  


I think technical term tsunami. fair lot morons here.

Morons everywhere (source: grew somewhere else, living US many years now).

The issues become intolerably bad said morons refuse let go cherished beliefs even beliefs clearly refuted reality.

I pretend offer solutions. someone's *entire worldview* hilariously wrong, fix that? create physicality mental pain go country concert disease? really matters hospitalizations. local hospitals keep demand not, excess mortalities could avoided otherwise? That’s what’s important. healthcare system remaining unstrained everyone given adequate care? Markets collapsed March, bitcoin followed suit. Bitcoin rebounded really goddamn fast though compared traditional money plays. hate bitcoin fuck I'm in.

Edit: wait second, BTC practically tracked SPY. Fuck it, I'm out. *ring around rosie, pocket full posies, ashes, ashes, fall down* wrong he's still wrong. 

COVID tracking project grades Florida data A. I'm really sorry lost friend :( seriously implying Voodoo level breathing exercises?

Do really need 90 page research report tell breathing exercises numerous cultures independently developed thousands years actually benefits? mean sure, would look studies new drugs make sure they're safe breathing exercises? Come on, need study tell breathing deep good. He’s Ron Paul. 100,000 what? Positive test cases? Confirmed dead Americans? 100,000 exactly? Huh, Bay Area? live SF mask wearing near ubiquitous. That’s partly true. anticipation things looking like Texas guessed things ALREADY like weeks weren’t noticing testing yet. Texas still better shape NY blindsided (though course government paying attention last two months shouldn’t that’s another story) It’s really bizarre watching northeast isn’t it? I’m sitting like “uh guys...we flipped fuck shut high hundreds/low thousands per day *still* got screwed. fuck y’all doin there?” wish whole world would follow suit. economy comes crashing July 31st, what? ""too bad, sad"" millions people? least trend data suggests Florida able tests per day time. better believe he'd prefer poors. agree seems likely. 

But happens deaths show rates saw places earlier outbreak? feel like one talking possibility every day 7D avg continues decline outcome becomes likely. Citing study done researchers institution conclusion beneficial institution referencing opposing studies suggesting better theirs. Like **** would believe nonsense. Also mathematical model real study anything, best build hypothesis cant yield real world conclusions.

Phase 3 ignore numbers. avoiding driving Sweden next couple weeks afraid dying covid-19 rational avoiding afraid dying traffic accident. 

Well... Sweden closed foreigners countries around Sweden let people Sweden in. driving even option. maybe extra risk minimal, there's also good reason neighbouring countries hold borders closed. heard mentioned Illinois looks rather bad well.

If look number deaths previous years current showing significant increase.

&amp;#x200B;

Maryland looks high well. 
Mass charts months ago 100% excess according tot charts shared. older generations felt way. 

My mother, 50 btw, called Hitler lockdown.

I grossed told that.

I've also heard Half-Whit, Whitler Whitless. Yeah look people first get tests scarce logic what’s point ?  strangers don’t know name , don’t know look like masks people around keep changing .

“ Christina describe people came contact protests ? “ ... “ 5’8 , white deep voice help? “ 

Zero chance would Help anyway especially huge protests . 

If protestor knew people came
In contact would let know unless lowlife I'm surprised even fit car. headline misleading.

You need wear mask outside home, outdoors car, within 6 feet anybody. stupid question. true, increases minimal nonexistent northern cities largest sustained protests? Yet increases rampaging areas South far fewer protests? pretty clear biggest increases places reopened bars restaurants way soon. given going bumfuck Missouri San Francisco.

That's incredibly dumb though Welp, looks like funerals go soon! Thanks coach says it’s fine makes 32/hr plus benefits im sure It’s fine Given governors actions don’t think cares suffering. Huh? cited news article May Texas’s numbers. Texas’s official data shows fatalities increasing right along Wrong, announced military getting first round...

And yes whole idea using sheets (or tablecloths, curtains...) fabric project, really. This!!! fat face scarf covers ugliness nicely Maybe I'm biased, call people see showing crowded places without masks ""young adults."" always look least 50.  Wait one Chadox vaccine?

I understand sometimes sometimes spokes people health organizations makes short statements example, IMO spokesperson's ""thinking"" rather tldr studies based statements made. words, summaries studies, expert opinions. should. horrendous. remember state first phase (Illinois) like 25 percent positivity something, maybe one 10 people wearing masks.

Scarring lungs def permanent. like liver part human body. doctor friend said believe time permanent scarring that's taking place clear answers. afterward, recipes remake ingredients. Looks like new talking points out. Stop blaming China, start blaming protests.

Even though peaked month ago cities largest protests North East still dropping daily places opened bars early never took lockdown seriously NYC back March April. Coincidentally states happen ""red"".

Funny is.

My town massive protests increase cases outside one nursing home reopened bars restaurants.

Now increasing every day.

It's hilarious see weak logic used many people time. Asshats always best shit people’s heads.  Ah yes, everyone knows successful progressive people never go bars.

That sarcasm, case thought otherwise. one knows animals dying, lab results samples still weeks away, according government

It *could* covid related. likely *could not* be. School starts 4-8 weeks lot places. studies? provide links

I usually respond people splice conversation like did. responded must dubious point, definitive data protests contribute spread. That's laughable current pneumonia deaths Florida year way compared typical year. don’t know it’s purposefully hidden it’s definitely outside realm possibility aren’t testing people died pneumonia covid19 purposely. There's home elderly often walk past I've seen older folks sitting right next outside without mask. know, maybe elderly trouble breathing them. justification Sweden — unlike Denmark close schools, bars, restaurants, cafes, shopping malls, sports clubs pandemic hit — much higher number people testing positive COVID-19.  recent assessment, Denmark's infectious diseases agency, SSI, judged average 67 people Sweden tested positive coronavirus per 100,000 inhabitants preceding week.  long way 20 person per 100,000 threshold Denmark wants countries citizens enter country leisure purposes.

Makes sense, see anyone would angry this. Thanks, mean alot :) long they’re distanced right agree say 100% way now. still wouldn’t risk personally myself, it’s compromise gives people option much safer outing drink we’re seeing crap show indoors right now. 

If could still keep everyone 6 feet apart risk goes way way Well even cases surging see deaths going ever downwards. meant said, definitely looks like. Creep mini rant want get chest.

I went supermarket. Last week pissed 30% people wearing masks. 

This time I'm generous 15%. alarming many people threw common sense away. walking around breathing everyone. heard one b*tch make shady remark people wearing masks. course genius would speak up. 🙄

Being reckless makes numbers rise numbers rise people reckless. Wtf? difficult put mask hour? 

Dumbasses putting everyone risk. /r lady getting Costco instantly pulled chin walked looking around like wanted someone confront her.

tough. cycle soon rain season starts... another extremely worrying move government - seems like using C-19 blanket excuse bring number worrying policies effect everyone, particular - civilized society - provided highest level assistance. Hell, I’m deemed essential all. state first reopen company couldn’t wait follow suit. opened back first day. could’ve stayed while, except shitty DoL would give pathetic fucking claim ever would left without food less two weeks fast track eviction. hate around dozens hundreds people don’t take seriously get right front face masks don’t want homeless without food. typing lunch break.

You stay safe too. live metro Detroit disheartening. We’ve groceries delivered daughters health - I’d go insane someone 🤦🏼‍♀️ Wait..By ""it"" referring mask, right? mask increase amount virus buildup sick?

I think confirming mask increase viral load. Correct I'm wrong. Yes. understand that. 

There idiots would go Antarctica infect people. 

My comparison simply - county live East Coast 8 miles across. drive three counties get work, almost touch two others way border freeway. 

There plenty counties Southeast small, many rural counties 2-3000 residents. Versus LA County millions. 

People may aware different is, they’ve never lived somewhere else. Testing per 1000 adjusted population. people like say that, wonder, think Chevrolet Dodge CEO bought from? Oh right, one gives shit. car CEO. Tesla company done leaps bounds progressing sustainable energy. Ohio back 1000 today. list biggest states, we're starting ramp up.

Almost every study blames indoor human human transmission majority cases. intend anyone live that. want people either die take absolute bottom barrel shit-tier 7.25 hour jobs. people constant fear safety stability might demand subhuman minimum wage. financial violence carried state advantage corporations. Great back-alley emergency appendectomies Dexter style kill rooms too. silver lining Florida test quickly get herd immunity. sources say virus mutations weaker? Either way don’t think people calm either new cases vaccine problem politicians straight lying continuing maintain double standard here. can’t encourage people go protest (like governor did!) turn around demand people celebrate Fourth July, even they’re outside. makes think bars restaurants though? people wearing masks? they're wearing masks protests much closer proximity one another. 

Also think know anything incubation period still. recently said asymptomatic transmission unlikely, heard exact opposite two months ago. could use hermetically sealed helmets air supply like 1920s diver suits hahah Thanks. think chiffon got 100% polyester, same. Nice bra bro fair, even getting virus would better April. They’ve learned lot since even then. crazy breakthrough, still improvements.

The media recently turned study sunspot activity ""scientists predict mini ice age coming imminently"" concluded sunspot activity would decrease 60%. 

""Journalism"" attention grabbing headlines accurate reporting. Yup. RemindMe! 3 weeks

No running away, I’ll 3 weeks :-) actually might know they’re punished lower rating. Hopefully. Please list hospitals overwhelmed recently people left die without ICU ventilator. I'm actually not.

I'll try say one time:

Reff (they use quote included, often R used opposed R0, leads lot confusion, particularly amongst folk fuzzy math, always make point writing Reff R-effective) stay R0 suddenly drop 1 HIT reached.

Discontinuities like rare natural phenomena.

As increasing percentage population infected, assuming immunity least period time considering, Reff declines. Reff sigma shaped. real life might properly thought two sigma curves noisy junction around 1 R axis &amp; around HIT percentage-infected axis.

I probably said ""Reff diverges R0 asymptotically, accelerating towards 1"", would precise. point is, **_absolutely not_** discontinuous. case Reff stays R0 HIT reached drops instantaneously 1. Therefore, effects herd immunity increasingly apparent HIT approached.

Nowhere say this: keep talking like prevent large fractions population infection.

That's misinterpretation said. Thanks links. excess deaths may COVID-19 related certainly indirectly caused COVID-19. Actually school age kids given false narratives misleading journalism social media people trust like friends family often reject things taught classes like science history don’t match came people hold higher schools teachers aren’t respected many students. actual education system isn’t best, it’s worst ineffective doesn’t account many students refuse participate anything. think there’s lot different factors regarding culture young kids many places around country getting many black white messages movies cartoons aimed getting encouraged enough compassionate empathetic others around them.

Easily possible if, say, mild symptoms like coughing still present prevents deterioration. Would still good result, course. worried caravans giving us diseases fact exact opposite Based link, would mean almost assuredly estimates suggest number COVID-19 deaths reported first weeks pandemic captured two-thirds excess deaths US. Potential explanations include delayed reporting COVID-19 deaths misattribution COVID-19 deaths respiratory illnesses (eg, pneumonia) nonrespiratory causes reflecting complications COVID-19 (eg, coagulopathy, myocarditis). excess deaths involved pneumonia influenza underlying causes.  Thousands people still pretty small number planning give vaccine billions people, different. 

There sorts drugs, vaccines, procedures looked fine lab testing turned dangerous small, specific groups people ways tests (especially quick, limited tests like these) could possibly shown, people different one another, health requirements vary much course lifetime. 

A good example drug thalidomide. mid-twentieth century, successfully passed testing showed harmful effects. true, vast majority people, harmful effects. However, people certain narrow window early pregnancy took it, wound giving birth babies arms legs. 

That never came testing, that's relatively small group people (people pregnant, short window specific part pregnancy) simply included testing. 

You can't test drug's effects every single kind person world --- impossible. many. people born without arms legs period drug banned, that's super comforting.

Scientists call difference vitro (""in lab"") vivo (""in wider population."") ALWAYS differences two, always things testing cover. quicker less testing (as case here), bigger differences going be, that's statistics work.

I definitely still getting vaccine, people crazy concerned this. fair, one forcing drivers work Uber, choice know they're signing Actually cases trending back NYC. 270 new cases added today, numbers started creeping back past couple days. Maybe learn use head, sweetie pie. It’s car ride us weekend hotel stay. I’m worried able effectively socially distance. Honestly, reason know part job check coworkers find people sick, tend hear quite stories 2020 America right. wear mask everywhere. agree. Subscribed Anyone want take odds “Karen” used word 2020? put pretty strict meassures 
mandatory masks since beginning.

We almost unaffected disease itself, numbers low. people worried actual experience pandemic. Phase Three: numbers? numbers? hear stories REAL PEOPLE they're itching go back bars Disney World. looked numbers Wikipedia. 159,986 yesterday, 93,206 6/16. that's 66780 cases (42% total) last 2 weeks. numbers increasing rapidly beginning.    


CA - 9700

I’m neutral politics subject, I’m logical. waste time it? can’t contact trace it. people saying China's numbers fake. see hypocritres yelling America's number. Sure statues /s What, Texans exaggerate? /s sound like pessimist. Imagine pessimist.  Yup. Everyone's got fucking agenda side something stupid there's million excuses ""ok"" put lives risk.

It's disgusting ultimately really participate politics, despite fact philosophically I'm clearly closer one side.

If going sit (correctly) tell president strung toes bullshit ""no tests, cases,"" try feed *the exact bullshit* virus infects people disagree use cover ass wind killing grandma every day crowd weeks. That's disgusting. 7 days lag increase cases increase deaths beginning pandemic. understand might longer (basically, testing) it’s 5 clear weeks since spike cases began Florida, there’s corresponding increase deaths. 

On May 28, 7-day moving average cases 659. June 15 1,700 - nearly triple. June 15 two weeks ago, seen deaths triple, increase daily deaths all. 7-day moving average bouncing 30 40 since mid-May. 

I’m saying “where deaths”. 1,000 people died Florida last month. I’m saying it’s 5 weeks since increase cases began, haven’t seen corresponding increase deaths yet. That’s really good news pray holds. Whew, good know poors suffering- real Texans.

Still, I'm proud fellow Bostonians. Way better we've heard people states/citices. Tuition isn’t usually paid yet fall though- it’s July. least experience, tuition isn’t actually paid til closer August, even it’s fully refundable classes start (and often week classes).

I agree risk mitigation, also believe risks far outweigh benefits. difference car crash car crashes aren’t contagious- whereas one super spreader could potentially cause chain reaction thousands infections.

You also figure people age 25 aren’t great assessing risk. brain isn’t even fully formed around age 25, prefrontal cortex, part brain literally deals risk assessment last form. 

I’d also add there’s huge chance financial risk abstaining year- like said, already ways postpone scholarships financial aid without much issue.

Lots illnesses lasting effects yes, although don’t believe young people aware risks play- are, obviously, like said, risk assessment strong skill young people general, it’s literally factor biology. Teenagers general tend deal far injuries like, often poor decision making. injuries, chance full recovery age high, whole doesn’t matter much... highly contagious virus, it’s that’s issue. 

If students kept 100% isolated within students age group, think would bit different- personally still think wouldn’t worth risk, chance severe issue would low, would much akin teenagers making dumb decisions result fully recoverable injuries. there’s way they’re fully isolated, risk grows exponentially. I'm sorry  Canadian pretty odd comes Covid. 

Looking [National surveillance case COVID-19, found one added COVID list suffer “onset (or exacerbation chronic) cough” coupled participating “in mass gathering identified source exposure.” 

A Canadian also branded COVID case “fever (over 38 degrees Celsius)” “close contact confirmed case COVID-19.”

When comes “close contact,” close talking about? 

Not close seems: 

*“…a single laboratory confirmed case COVID-19 \[long-term care home\], resident staff member would trigger outbreak would declared.”* says the[ Ontario Ministry Health’s COVID-19 Outbreak Guidance Long Term Care Homes words, maintenance man senior’s home 800 residents tests positive COVID, 800 residents would meet “close contact” qualifier. 

 Ontario Health’s [Case Definition – Novel Coronavirus confirms this: runny nose “being patient ward facility nosocomial outbreak COVID-19” add Grandma COVID case count. “Facility” could include long-tern care homes, deaths occurred.

So, need one confirmed case COVID residents nursing home become “probable” cases soon show [broad list COVID One COVID red flags includes “decrease blood pressure”??!! 

As nursing homes - holy f\*\*k. 

Back April, many seniors dying, military called assist Quebec Ontario nursing homes. month later Canadian Armed Forces released [a 15-page exposing worse-than-third-world conditions Ontario nursing homes. There’s short list compiles list 19 worst observations made military. stomach it, read. I’m TN cases growing lot areas especially tourist small cities.    
We someone work test positive came back Florida family vacation - whole bunch family also tested positive. RemindMe! 2 weeks We're not.  bit myth vaccines hidden long term side effects. biggest risk first days/risk taking 

Not exactly true well tested vaccines. Antibody dependent enhancement real. it’s important get vaccines properly trials distributing mask looks threatening. worn light blue one. seller responsible all? I’m super worried well. People easily come celebrate Fourth July. mention we’ve ten community outbreaks San Diego past week, five restaurants. People travel. caring elderly father I’ve gotten know lot older people constantly traveling Texas Arizona least month. portion Anti Mask it’s flu type people. honestly feel new “dimming” restrictions slightly helpful. Sounds great less satisfying. Probably not. work one top chemical refining companies world, Louisiana. considered essential, raw products eventually go food medical supplies.

We leaders coronavirus response measures followed step step cdc government recommendations. governor announce phase 1 2 reopening, stood firm policies didn’t relax them. fact, even began requiring masks time going come within close contact others.

Even still, walk daily operating unit people aren’t listening. However, reporting supervisors I’ve watched compliance go maybe 30-40% closer 80%.

But vacuum site. It’s fine good wear mask fear kicked site, mentality don’t doubt rip thing first chance get.

A lot people think numbers fudged, it’s effort get Biden elected. think early know. Hopefully permanent damage. maps/data tracking automatically mark case ""recovered"" finished etc 2 weeks? seems like data sources keep cases ""active"" unless person dies hospital it, 2 weeks person considered done one way another government *has* taken care us. Sorry spend 1200 check stupid shit blowing unemployment looking work. That's problem.

Believe go places sometimes makes angry. people selfish lazy ? survey published Centers Disease Control Prevention found 54% people infected coronavirus unable pinpoint may infected Experts said survey results underscore important point: Community asymptomatic spread alive well, makes contact tracing especially difficult “What you’re seeing community-based spread 20 40% people infected don’t symptoms,” Fauci said. “So standard, classic paradigm identification, isolation, contact tracing doesn’t work matter good don’t know you’re tracing.”

It actually work. need lockdown control reopen safely.

Which happened. explained thread problems logic. chosen listen.

Your article posted disputes FactCheck reporter Angelo Fichera, interviewed Jensen, noted, ""Jensen said think hospitals intentionally misclassifying cases financial reasons. that’s comments widely interpreted paraded social media.""  FactCheck's conclusion: ""Recent legislation pays hospitals higher Medicare rates COVID-19 patients treatment, evidence fraudulent reporting.""  Aultman, member editorial board American Medical Association’s Journal Ethics, told PolitiFact “very unlikely physicians hospitals falsify data motivated money so.” blocked commenting last post I'll follow along like everyone else... ""Man young people crazy, putting us danger like this""... Put mask on...🤔 whatever tell correct 👍🏿 much like Gavin think good move, wish would apply restrictions WHOLE state rather areas. Let people complain ""muh freedom"" want, stricter lockdowns need happen again. can't even imagine spike that's going occur weekend inconsiderate people. even gotten take since mid March. worth risk me. dont reject shit. went without mask joined rally

you put risk, hard expect people protest could get sick.

The reason likely matter, would impossible know exactly got sick sick crowd size... sort worthless data set

Also posting garbage / right wing site like NY Post, proves nothing.

That paper mouth piece Trumps bullshit. really matter people get sick South Carolina's health director looks pissed today press conference link data? thank true idk makes way guys talk satisfying Jane ignorant slut! mean, remove civil, maybe that's focus lie? think general population get vaccinated June 2021 even measures successful. health worker patients first priority? number huge itself?! tests rigged? increase MA. think we’re good control group people overly cautious here, plenty protests, aren’t re-opening quickly. 0 deaths yesterday spikes 2-3 weeks ago would expected one. he's engineered storytelling, Steve Jobs Star Wars, Musk Disney's Star Wars. Yeah it’s really rough situation, feel like going result shift winds it’s made lot inequalities society glaringly obvious lot people lived G-ville almost decade. That's surprising since probably highest concentration educated people north florida. Also home large medical industry players like Shands, north florida regional medical center, VA hospital. 

Your take St. Aug. little surprising since would guessed that, among north florida cities, St. Aug would closely allied places like ville. 

The rest state way less surprising.  

I say general attitude Florida residents ""ill take care - too"" newer phenomenon. think Florida started go rails stand ground law Zimmerman trial. shitty snow birds real vested interest community help either - imagine demographic sentiment increases every year. epidemiologists estimating 60-70% global population infected point? choose live fear end getting sick anyway Take cats groomer washed brushed out. switch food allergy reducing one. Lastly, buy high grade air filter. It’s decreasing aerosolized cat saliva I've read hypothesis elsewhere regarding T-cell immunity conferred prior infections common cold virus, another coronavirus. Hopefully proves true. so, lowers herd immunity threshold. Taxi's much better honesty. types public transports generally shit drivers. solution would fully fund things like bullet trains solar panel public transports *in general* US getting around easier without take car / cab / uber everywhere.  Sounds like something boomer would say :) Why?

Go home! courage , say orange guy Sure, think truly think small group people eating spaced restaurant versus 100s 1000s people standing shoulder shoulder caused increase - disingenuous. telling pharmaceutical company spending tons money produce vaccine may even pan even does, sold cost?

If that's actually case shareholders sue ever-loving SHIT them. First off, leaving house unless absolutely necessary, finding public restrooms problem unless putting ppl risk like lot Americans are... 

But IMO kind baffles allowed public restrooms open. cesspool coronavirus. Fecal urine particles easily spread virus. smart, public restrooms open anywhere, including restaurants. People adults hold get home. 

Of course, smart, restaurants salons open begin vaccine... Students leave campus go jobs go home

That's probably guy responding said ""seal campus"" Thank you. remarkable many ""elected"" idiots responsible states. People getting sick rates 40,000+ daily, somehow fools think real mandates necessary yet. need get? 100,000 cases day someone get head sand something? mean come on! fair kings island tempature checks entrance park required guests wear face masks...that said, I'm sure enforce face mask rule be... No, lock eight years. pretty apparent something's going look meat prices right now. Ouch. wont. we've learned one thing this, majority people proud learn people's mistakes Thanks info! God, cleverness amazes me. agree people don’t wear masks respect social distancing, make excuses behavior. said, one person could handled properly got here. Trump. done job correctly, everyone would wearing masks. blame stupid people stupid-er leader doesn’t lead first place? It’s fault. Period. Yes, people fucking dumb. it’s presidents job enforce best us leave hands dumb fucks country drive golf carts yell White power. wierd government done anything address obvious least lack job performance president. job represent US global scale currently he's failing miserably since we've deemed unworthy entry countries. would like child coming school malnourished filthy would likely family services make visit possibly take child home. Yet leader treating us almost nothings happening. odd makes wonder government even legitimate entity more. thought might care care? Man one thread read article? Students coming back Ithaca regardless online classes not! campus students already signed leases they're claiming they're depressed staying home.

The exact happening college town live in, since many students lost internships got cabin fever home, students typical summer even though classes online. mask game lost.

At point anti-mask nothing say. misremembered; AR fireworks thing. found talks it, basically download app, watch 12 minute show many times want 9 pm midnight (local time) July 4th.

We aren’t debating whether US’s stance masks three months isn’t problematic. Happy carry another thread. ever met someone chubby face skinny body? chubby legs, skinny everything else? Everyone's body comp different judge womans face picture. I'm even saying shes morbidly obese, well could be. certainly fact like OP claiming article mention all. heated gamer moment swine flu mean study's kind b.s. critically ill patient treated steroids? expected showing data already understand disease progression data reporting limitations. deep flaw american social system though.   say mango man one best names ive ever heard. Im using one LMAO Probably best get takeout eat home. agree. yes r&amp;d spending is.function size. Interesting, little specific feel comfortable? facility bunch 3rd parties I’m sure say. working beach area Florida right now, people outside everywhere. Probably majority tourists, place fucking zoo.  look now, strange things happening elsewhere Americas. Brazil's daily death toll appears peaked case toll. Mexico good (relatively) day today too. Peru Chile seem peaking well. Last week's updated NJ revision - initially 750s - NJ deaths update mainly older deaths added deaths week released well.  


If look perspective numbers basically flat week week. yeah, unfortunately. i’m lucky live suburbs easy access lots parks mountains. yeah think we've reached point America give shit anymore. Coronavirus stay vaccine, even then, good luck getting people take it. Scientist agree effective shut downs isolation. shut downs possible social distancing effective. social distancing possible (meaning keeping distance 6ft) masks effective.

That Asia Europe following looks like working. strange reason Americans decided masks work. Maybe explains US reached different result. Congrats USA!! Keep up!!! Bingo! Stealing ip medicines pretty much objectively good though. I'm British Columbia that's sure. miss there. good news. Actually, money trickles up. That's wealthy become wealthy. Read bottom one. Actually, no. aren't. know someone who’s mother pass COVID back April. denial telling everyone thinks it’s hoax hospital killed mom. wish made up. like little kid who's stuck inside threw tantrum friends work get go out, kids fomo. According 
  ""COVID-19 thought spread mainly close contact person-to-person""

While touching things one infection vector, main one. got tested twice. ever accidentally inhaled chlorinated pool water airway? feels kind like that. bit burning sensation lasted minute, main problem, main problem body gets panicky feeling ""this part body never supposed touched."" visceral feeling wrongness, lasted much longer discomfort burning. still lied it, made hopelessly incompetent mistake.

People died result.

Someone needs accountable reporter asked Trump wanted fire Fauci early COVID (maybe back April) Trump responded saying reason actually likes Fauci.

But Trump's rhetoric trying convince country everything returning back normal Fauci saying complete opposite, might change mind. ""tourists"" bring special ""gift"" you, brand new, shiny swine flu China. /S Yes, know study. consider 10 vs 40\* years life lost, comparable disaster two even ignoring Sweden small. much worse them. think right answer middle, can't remove emotional side situation. aunt lost friends 80s, really tragic. friend lost uncle battle cancer. tragic say 85-year-old grandma murdered, body missing. Thinking would die soon anyway comforting. Ideally one would like person go away natural, traumatic way, chance say final goodbye.

So, statistical analysis give expected number years grandma left. personal level, know would days maybe 10-20 years more. emotional trauma generated uncertainty fact get see loved one one last time. enough people indirectly affected, cold analysis longer relevant. Another factor is, pure life expectancy terms, death one 20-year-old equivalent death two 50 year-olds, six 80-year-olds. difficult compare pain 1 vs 2 vs 6 everyone assumes survive lost years life.

Not true. researchers' opinions I've read, universal thing lots uncertainty this. open question. organ damage already confirmed, people already died recovery, know even medium term effects. could know soon thing causes pulmonary fibrosis (this conservative worse case scenario, pulmonary damage already there). We'd know people start dying year two. not, good news, may take decades tracking real death toll would really difficult. I'm sure we'd ever know true impact accuracy. think may become noticeable US unhealthy population, sure places like Sweden.

\*I put 40 countries life expectancy 70s, median age 30s. developed countries life expectancy 80s median age 40s.

Edit: Btw, considering form death, subjective I'd say wars worse virus, even death numbers comparable. one people shot cut agonize, blown pieces, suffocate lose consciousness room hospital. factors age form death important beyond cold statisticcs. Noone cares still lied it, made hopelessly incompetent mistake.

People died result.

Someone needs accountable Sensationalized. say ""research suggests it"", link study, idea research looking at. seen many newspaper articles this, essentially anecdotal hospital workers. seen real science outside small (essentially anecdotal) studies hospital patients. extremely worrisome, since information single important thing would need know judge actions next months, nobody seems interested it.

Hm, well, agree wait see real results. However, listen TWiV? *highly* recommend amazing. One thing that's remarkable many things Dr. Daniel Griffen called early on. recent recap/status update clinical treatments instance super far ahead curve lot: point HCWs end prescient prognostications. Further, many anecdotes social media example r/COVID19positive/ also many Facebook groups wherein people suffereing long term effects give testimony. Sure, may wrong probably true. Also, knew SARS/MERS often caused long term sequelae. 

But! totally agree say ""since information single important thing would need know judge actions next months, nobody seems interested it"". frustrating me. Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) become common COVID vocabulary long ago barely talks let alone *researches* it. However, less contagious Wuhan strain (admittedly science really proven difference, seems overwhelmingly likely). They've harder time eliminating recent outbreak Bergamo strain (though act immediately now) Daegu outbreak.

See, TWiV virologists think claim new strain contagious sensationalized! TBH done research that, experts respect think contagious. interesting much know time consuming would try sort every single thing like this. true S. Korea bit harder time containg new outbreak whatever reason, still managed to. Bizarrely, flu deaths peak winter Florida Arizona US. seen good science explaining this. might simple schools winter, UV light summer.

I seen science either tbh think exists! Thsi fantastic article poorly seasonality understood generally: tbh think guessing right re: COVID. Maybe highly seasonal, maybe all, probably something one *really* knows right now. FWIW leading novel coronavirus expert Christian Drosten least one point supported view summer could bring R 0.5: Mark Lipsitch Harvard thought seasonal really: Honestly sure either updated views, tbh assume probably since good scientists that's good scientists do. 

 speculate we'll see scenario travel uncontained countries allowed, ""quarantine countries"" like Iceland play role intermediary. would fly remain Iceland could guarantee next country coronavirus-free.

Hm interesting idea! would work digital nomads wealthy part though. Norway continuing far right militarizing border seems like possible scenario.

Yikes maybe. *think* non-coronavirus reasons Norway well insulated lurching right right (its current government center right). yeah maybe far right push center right this. think likely. FWIW Denmark left wants closed borders lol center right pushing ""REOPEN NOW"". fascinating. Absolutely. TTI stand for, btw? Never heard acronym before.

Ah stands Test, Trace, Isolate. become pretty popularize,d defined it. Apologies. 

Anyway need log thank interesting conversation! Literally found asshole who's calling hoax, complaining economy, saying virus overrated tested positive today. complained last Monday coughing day, showed rest week. 

I tried calling schedule appointment get tested got denied three symptoms around asshole. use current UTI excuse get fucking test. never said anything N95s.

He said ""masks""

People died result. facts. Yeah, Baker’s done fantastic job since thing started tin foil hat people wear masks government doesn’t ask to? government asks wear masks, refuse wear masks?

That’s like Monty Python sketch. I'm professor I've seen thing. Usually survey conducted trusted group faculty members, questions going back forth endlessly faculty committees. tried once. restaurant required masks seated, staff masks single-use gloves, sanitizer everywhere, used disposable cups, tables distanced, ate rooftop patio, went low traffic time day. everything right. mortal terror whole meal. won’t time soon. ...I idea talking about. manslaughter? least expelled. Going party stupid, going party knowing COVID evil. wants kill himself? SOL? Even horrifying. Yup.

Every day waits, blood hands. need think way make people wear them. Disney sold mandalorian helmets? Would people wear them? 
So... significant difference FoxNews Economist lie different things. think National Mandate months ago would helped. instead ""power"" left st state level, imo caused thing continue long. national shut down, instead letting states roll whatever time frame wanted. came lockdown others going in. made zero sense.

I wanted hijack comment state several states acting separately, federal government chilling back seat, seems awfully similar Confederate Government type.

Edit- may wrong details, basically given explanation ive always understood

Here's wiki case anyone wants reading I’m sure it’s side-effect testing. /s never French pangolin. still lied it, made hopelessly incompetent mistake.

People died result.

Someone needs accountable. saying along. like teenagers whole ""you must wear mask"" mandate thing stupid people make point it.  No. Google lumped whole weekend together. 3 day average sure getting downvoted. clearly Googled ""Colorado covid cases"" get number wrong. Look dates. skips June 26 June 29. states dashboard correct. bribe people wear mask.... Yh Problem NYC hotspot states like Florida etc got relaxed thought affect them. hope people realise one state experiencing spike mean rest country clear let guard  clarify, Florida _already reports_ daily COVID-19 hospitalization. specific, report total hospitalizations every day math get daily. 

The change coming FL break number county level. _excellent_ news need level transparency. wanted clarify. Anyone else death threats masks yet? Man, recommended mask subreddit someone they're absolutely going nuclear me. /Laughs Floridian
// means sobbing they're stupid arrogant? find info predictions made Qwant? sure google for. needed places get hit early mandate masks indoors. Trump politicized we're fucked now. Thanks sharing! Great concert Don’t advice, wanted say really hope everything works well you. Wonder we’ll break 50k daily new cases sometime week. Probably NJ closed non-essential businesses mandate masks. number new cases dropped compared two months ago. live missouri parsons recently made masks mand. Welp. Alot people wearing sooooo. Washington weigh respond Washington’s role COVID-19 first? Sorry sorry. Wear masks please. sorry. sounds like majority country music artists spoke two artists. hate country music vilify whole genre almost seem adhering public health suggestions. Trump sux. He's racist.

Worst president history.

Your point being? though? particularly bad Florida? I'm originally Florida still get it.  Dang sympathy people. live county lockdown months yet like 200 confirmed cases total basically deaths start question hell going on. protests made matters worse. Imagine told stay home news three months station tells OK go protest. natural people get upset say fuck shit. Factory farming destroying antibiotic efficacy send us back Stone Age. problem Houston keeps getting flooded. 3rd word country see face, agree appear overweight. that's see. cant claim shes morbidly obese picture face. cant even see stomach, arms legs. Everyone built differently, could skinny legs, stomach etc. bigger parts. claimed ""She morbidly obese"" proven fact. course, it’s ideal, explaining it’s possible go 100% Alright read article, understand title probably clickbait FUCK STUPID BE.

Stay tuned update read article

Update: ""I think point it'll sort disappear"" - Trump... guys I'm tired this. anything say Try living one states. beyond frustrating. slight addition previous executive order, mandated mask use indoors public places, expands include mandated mask use outdoor settings 6ft+ social distancing can’t maintained. 

Like previous order, “mandatory” enforced state, since includes exemption anyone medical issue mask wearing, specifically says need documentation issue. it’s good messaging, isn’t really “mandatory” sounds.  Oh that'd awesome! Yeah, I'm American live here. March seen suspect time US one hotspots. reality though first 50 cases one Guatemalan brought back Spain, Italy US. deported US. one exception British woman flew LA. Next time look back take huge step direction; usually works without saying anything. Yeah really hard keep cool people straight fools. idea earth I, Esmerelda Foofypants, Queen Seahorse Penises, would ever even single scrap rationality questioned. don’t think that’s answer looking for, true. what's contradicting: eventually economy take big hit, together public health. way see hospitals overrun states let virus run course. Eventually **have** close businesses. 

The question far willing go sacrifice lives economy? Pretend nothing wrong ~~hope goes away~~ fulfill whatever real agenda is. Yeah, people think like this. coming together rationalize countries managed this. division partisan issue US experiencing disappointing. blue towels tested best (according one source) materials certain brands. don’t link anymore. mask 400tc pillowcases, inserts polypropylene dust mite sleeves pillows. wish here. wine box delivered today delivery guy needed open door see 21, wasn’t even wearing mask. get works outdoors, put one you’re asking someone open door foot front you!

Don’t threaten good time  saying wrong crowd. us already know that. makes sense Interesting original headline used correct term ""Latino"" changed. He's talking big months now. waiting for?  San Diegan, hope close beaches reason least weekend water stations shut whatever reason? many false positives? now... case rate exceed MA’s time. least took measures try stop it. Texas zero people work, whereas least resources people. Also, always hindsight. attributing prevention iceberg/flu-like fatality HI 2% NYC infected sounds like total misuse HI. ""nearing HIT"" 2%.

That point making. iceberg/flu-like-fatality theory true, point NY city's reservoir undetected cases would vicinity HI effects apparent stats, yet not.

You keep reading things I've written, misreading misinterpreting them, yelling loudly I'm wrong.

Can stop now? clear math background discussion. know? CA released something today. Guess helped? rich  every one know wants return school. Cornell put guidance saying kids campus epidemiologically better society, according research. know ""few recovered now""? limited Americans... Human condition, worldwide.... 

Some cultures might cognizant type medical issue, trust hangup ""stupid things"" others shake heads at. rest world US infections beyond manageable. biggest challenge many parts world freeing ventilators ICU beds elderly need them. cause deaths lack access beds, drug greatly improve. toilets. Pay attention local health officials Maryland follow guidelines. experts, take advantage expertise. Put decision long possible. There's reasonably good chance gatherings large banned, decision could hands. That's really takes massive outbreak. I'm talking Washington. Dumbass cue mask burning chonker come tell everyone it’s hoax, masks ineffective shit Yes. Contact tracing hard impossible targets resist, expect there's lot of.

And legal process try enforce likely delayed much makes irrelevant. lives bleak can't sit home thoughts feelings. need constant distraction continuous work, consumption served others. really hope sarcastic, nowadays can't sure. Thank  bunch pussies run government excess deaths mostly early pandemic. means include marginal case fatality rate declining even faster. Carolina reported largest daily increase COVID-19 cases Wednesday, adding **1,843** new cases pushing state’s total since March 66,513, according state Department Health Human Services.

10% positive really doubt ability look far ahead. people still touting relatively low death rates compared number cases still insist everything fine. Imagine every priest stepped pulpit declared Jesus loved neighbor therefore 100% masking protect neighbor loved. ...regardless.... Good luck enforcing that. world Cigna Blue Cross going know wear masks consistently correctly? going follow around make sure? Bush administration disaster quote it. ah, well, makes sense. tearing whole system. kind thinking perpetuates exactly result describing: nothing happening good citizens.

The US government managed pass extraordinary assistance times emergency. might extraordinary time *this* generation, US actually faced worse before. We've terrorist attacks, recessions, depressions, wars landed domestic soil, even pandemics - all, we've passed incredible things breakneck speeds address them. thing that's different time around weird complacency throwing bus. look forward podcast every week. 

Link really understands happening us way do. think early stages, people still coming terms pandemic thought pessimistic. he's not. knows we're think let virus destroy way life, clearly wants help save many lives possible.

This week described able visit grandchildren first time long time, teared talking grateful experience. kind rational person really wants help us. He's one following much possible. (Fauci amazing he's tougher position.)

I watched YouTube video Osterholm Oprah Winfrey Show like 2006? Talking exactly we're going now. eerie kind upsetting watch old interviews described exactly early stages pandemic would play out. Netherlands, belgium, basically almost every country europe nobody wears masks since beginning pandemic. control fact declining. encouraging government force masks infront peoples face dont work work specific circumstances. 

Why give basic rights quickly? tiny vicious. sad state conservatism country. can, single male family. 

If home costs less $800 rent bills month even official poverty level. know much average rental cost US is? $1000, utility's that. car payment. good insurance plan. someplace rent. $600 week cut half. still make kids wife. ain't much man. people bring things upon Telling 30 million followers COVID test 50% false positive rate spreading misinformation. 

Don't fucking idiot. Cringe  Yet Americans go crazy China. Lives Matter protests cause uptick covid-19 Lives Matter protests may slowed overall spread coronavirus Denver cities, new study test results show protesters caught Lives Matter protests led spike coronavirus cases, research — Protests — Causing Spikes Coronavirus Totally agree! wouldn’t risk either! unironically believe tbh  stats people follow say takes 3-5 weeks change public behavior see new case numbers, additional 1-3 weeks see change new hospitalization numbers, additional 1-3 weeks see change show deaths. Long story short, 4 weeks since lot states reopened, brace hard July.  gauards caused moved 200 prisoners Chino SQ weeks ago. Quarantined prisoners, let guards hang guards. next week regular guards spreading gen pop quarantined prisoners (who moved due risk Chino). guards taken Susanville...awesome work prison guards. awesome. zoomers care attention, validation internet points. Lol. Well yea, top 5 everyone's list. wife awsome though. Even can't breath she'll work kiss goodnight 😂 Lmao people harping us biggest GDP ignore fact highest amount people living poverty per capita highest wealth inequality, bloated military used bombing brown people countries submission. apart propaganda people brought with, guy. makes wonder, hell Dengue vaccine pass phase III? Everything said wrong. Wow wish state much fun.  shit show directly linked growing cases lower part state. one incident Harper's Lansing spread state. growing case numbers videos packed bars, obvious coming, know when. honestly better unannounced instead resulting tons people rushing bars one last night close. safe know people would bit apprehensive going hospital right like every hospital turning away non COVID-19 related patients.

Even assume excess deaths directly related COVID-19, argument would still suggest COVID-19 people died. 

Either way, 20,000-28,000 excess deaths lot 3 1/2 months. That's almost entire population county grew in. I'm CA bullshit. can't keep closing shit. unsupportable. People going continue get it, relief sight far vaccine. Closing businesses business sectors harm net good effect provide. particular, leave theaters alone. getting back feet someone theaters three times past couple weeks older newer old movies, packed moment. Way respond point. seem irrationally angry, hope find way calm down. Yeah masks? Never seen em entire family, brothers laws(and family) coworker got back florida vacations.


They said nuts ""missing out""...I hope ok dont potentially spread others. 

None wore masks.

Today, coworker walked me, mask around chin started asking means hes sweating, chills trouble breathing thought get tested. asked back 6 feet away put mask on, said needs get tested asap. 

He said ""I'll see feel days""

I want crawl hole. want even fun, type ""experts say"" phone let autocomplete finish rest sentence.

""Experts say government isnt effective force."" ~My phone, 2020

Hes wrong! That's I'm saying, though. course compromise necessary, every situation. That's false dichotomy. every issue 2 legitimate sides worthy compromise middle. world complicated that. Well, I'm sure make profit, they'll give back $79 million government gave them. It’s time. I'm sure enforced. /S



Seriously, masks mandatory inside businesses legally state people still fucking wearing inside police businesses enforcing all. hope works I'm going hold breath. Yes dare people throw around well sourced numbers disagree with. Great idea it’s going followed action. 

But won’t be. least anything significant amount people actually abide by.  Facebook Stans saying, 'People die COVID, they're counting those!!!11'

Of course are, people die AIDS, Leukemia, etc. die things condition weakened them.

The logic like saying, 'No one dies plane crashes, yes, 100 blunt force trauma deaths, could happened crash!' ever used uber, ever. think we’ll good spot. Oxford’s vaccine supposed give year immunity, that’s enough time permanent solution tested produced. Sadly, turning virus something political common Europe... comparison, machine learning system (from Youyang Gu) seems done better forecast systems current new U.S. infections running 200,000 per day rising. Depending assume asymptomatic infections asymptomatic presymptomatic spread, 500,000 per day unreasonable. clearly know talking before, that's hardly surprising. probably personal policy going forward keep doors locked confirm person pulling mask on. even let vehicle unless mask on. way, get belligerent, pull away safely cancel trip safe distance away.  Yeah went comments purely see anyone posted text Remember trump went mask factory refused wear one? put filthy fucking hands masks put back box? girlfriend's dad piece shit human. I'm really trying resist though people shitty stupid but.... damn hard sometimes.  Yes Pennsyltucky masks aren’t common occurence, matter Wolf says.

Sad 99% people wore masks, could really grapple virus. Sweden closed foreigners

It's closed EU citizens. welcome enter long follow current level restrictions there's also good reason

No, that's thing. there's extra risk, reason actually good.I completely understand neighbouring countries closed border, perogative, understand fear, that's fine. statistically, wrong. That's 100million *for planet* bv US.
Frankly think foreign company developing virus refuse sell USA.
We proven deserve nice things. AZ lives around Phoenix, Tuscon, and/or Flagstaff.

If there, pretty fucked. Minus packed van/car rides getting there. meals together facility. Mean Gov. Wolf trying keep residents safe. Please don’t listen. reference ""Yinz""? Cuz I'm cracking description cowboys good everyone else bad *Paging Dr. Barkley, Big Ol' women ICU, Paging Dr. Barkley.* Ok. I'm going block now. nice day. states shut March outbreaks way getting control, yet gotten control. lockdown helped curb things even worse states (besides questionable nursing home decisions may hurt death #'s states.) Georgia stayed open already point getting control, difference - states mentioned closed point. may late stop even closed right (which happened yet) mean $600 SPY calls let ride recession lol Oh definitely is, Mass still one states managed keep cases low continues decline. coincidence also one progressive states incredible healthcare system insures nearly everyone state. Ah, reddit convention sarcasm is:

BuY bEdS

My CoNdOlEnCeS LoSs KaRmA call anyone idiot? It’s insane people downvoted adding context fearmongering. Tells lot mindset people sub. live rural PA, probably like 30% people grocery store wearing masks, one enforces it. also many cases county I'm guessing also effect hopping certain populations. Like, reopens, moves bar crowd, may different people getting earlier. 

But then, infected several people bars, people much likely general population bar/club next weekend. would guess that's it--that people spread crazily, moves superspreader popuation, chance begin growing quickly. 

Or maybe something completely different! Looks better behaved US protests. ""Experts say"" media's favorite weasel word, always check see experts actual credentials are. Yes, right die, I’d suggest exercising caution thou Nobody killing anybody, nobody wants virus, nobody wants spread virus.

You people insane group Karens feed morbid ideology really question adopt kind propaganda brains. right view subject. Peru giving measures economy sinking, government giving last months poor people taking measures literally conglomerating markets streets like care anymore. use measures keep sacrificing economy curve infection. I’ve talking Tesla’s years kids next car going one. I’ll choosing different electric vehicle Musk’s behaviour. care others cannot respect don’t share particular belief. big lefty wish culture accessible. change language lot average person club completely baffled way communicate. think comes good place wanting inclusive non violent, self referential way easy outsiders participate in. look like minefield people want bring team. retarded. assumptions biased towards desired outcome. comparing:

* students coming back Ithaca learning online
* students coming back Ithaca learning person **with enforced testing**

Wow, safer enforced testing. finding! wrong comparison one going back Ithaca online safety protocol 100+ pages severe drawbacks players leaving bubble. I'm cautiously optimistic NBA taken measures limit contact even players bubble daily testing well. might modify somewhat say rich people might hang little bit wait initial deployment wave. could side effects got missed trials, especially faiiirly hasty development. Yup, I'm West Harrisburg think virus never existed spread already control point lockdowns worked okay start safely reopening regardless. let's everyone dig heals 330 million finally agree without compromise. individual person get plague, humanity sure getting deserve. Isn’t 1.5% study quite time ago? imagine would quite bit higher given many cases confirmed Southern California last couple weeks. number show whatever elderly doing, causing increase cases. walking around much better going work, going bars, going nightlife. dont know saying. First day actual quarantine shit started popping mid feb early march xbox live went lol I'm glad LA OC closed. Living LA, OC would default destination anything can't get LA. Ventura, Riverside, San Bernardino, OC. feels natural going south/north east/west. Northern OC becoming viral clusterfuck. San Diego far, hopefully safe LA, beaches closed. problem car accident analogy car crashes absolutely contagious. everything right road, still run risk reckless driver. Nothing publicly risk less. monolith. 

My dads university facing bankruptcy choose furlough even fall semester. everybody attends penn state. 

Those spaces mortgages extremely expensive. problem colleges problem public spaces general. can’t live total isolation year. Assuming teenagers ability risk asses speculation social financial fall speculation. factors states need considering comes rolling public spaces function time. Also actually graduated recently, tuition DUE July. It’s usually paid well that. went Penn State couple years out. know much virus decimating colleges college towns. get much problem socially young adults. incoming freshman can’t safe environment, shouldn’t freshman year person, regardless fun was. Lives can’t brought back. 

For part, people able learn remotely college. Online college exists reason. can’t gauge future experience year week put together. It’s best experience, literally live completely uncertain times. expectations things “normal” anytime soon need drop. normal we’re returning anytime soon. 

I wasn’t talking primary school post. need go back, don’t know best answer there. strictly talking college. Yale doesnt understand one day disappear like miracle theyre wasting time studies. sites do, proofreading dead art. 

Also, like username. timing great sure people already solidified 4th July plans, many loath cancel even restrictions actually put place. That's actually amazing news. Occupying public space traffic way actually good news probably decent business History drown partisan mudslinging. wow stand corrected Yeah, everyone (including Fauci) realized wrong corrected themselves. Yes, everyone wear masks, masks nothing one's health, vitamin D/sunbathing busy helping one's health kinds ways. like Edison century bad. Mask social distancing better either alone. delusional. 

*gestures* Take infirmary! Water wet. fact surprised learn interesting alzheimer's dementia causes death much higher rates 2020 average 2015-2019. suggests mortality rate due COVID-19 older populations even higher current calculations. whether doctors wear attractive clothing credibility online discussion  That’s valid. don’t think it’s universal though. Incorrect. One graphs outcome graphing outcome graphing presupposition.

So instance case protesters, total number protesters one protester might fact could quite low well resulting spike could quite high. Protesters families, take Ubers, eat, go grocery shopping on.

So one day protest, active event behind spike, might involve largefraction protesters becoming sick isolation, could lead large number follow-on cases. Exposure magnifying event, ongoing behavior.

Meanwhile exposures protest extremely limited, would see magnifying effect subsequent general data.

That's whole thing disease, risky behavior, people take risk people exposed person took risk.

This see news reporting cases ""trace back to"" things meat packing plant. number people plant get sick often valid data especially people go plant day day. total number cases traced back plant actually much higher total number cases plant itself.

Meanwhile certain things like beach party church gathering may create super spreader event small, long reaching lasting impact associated contract tracing graph.

More simply put consider patient zero effect. One guy gets sick. He's initial guy get sick. already know total count people getting sick patient zero event one. yet entire pandemic result disease spreads effects spread. could prevented one disease could prevented illnesses follow on.

So going back protester case. Suppose rural county protest 100 people. None protesters sick arrival. Five protesters eat sandwiches donated non-protester happens ill. total penetration group 5%. five protesters go back nearby cities counties. Two weeks later five people become infectious five clusters five separate counties would existed without protest. Four protesters go mega churches different parts state. mega churches completely healthy share communion two weeks later five full mega churches sick. Sick 3% total church attendees. many cases trace back churches separate question many cases trace back protest. total number cases caused protest includes total number cases caused churches.

We learn efficacy transmission exposure anti-transmission tactics taken protest churches.

Modeling disease hard. We're rivals much common. I'd love see source numbers. think everyone needs temper expectations this. Back month ago covid hearing Dr. Rick Bright, basically said aggressive vaccine schedule would still 2 1/2 years away. also explained entire medical supply infrastructure nowhere needs even distribute vaccine. I'm bit confused everyone expecting us vaccines fall, mass scale available everyone still even enough supplies infrastructure test everyone. Bender: *Now that, irony!* Gotcha sad true is.. supposed joke. Didnt go well tho. dont extra beds, get new lounger thats comfy. Life must much easier incredibly stupid. Yes, obviously people live borders. Yet that’s true it’s county, state, country. 

But California 100 *fewer* counties Georgia does. driving one county another isn’t *quite* thing. Harrisburg resident here. It’s quite astounding anyone wearing mask considered sheep. I’m slowly seeing mask usage go stores. know inevitable reaction things spike shut wearing something face hour shop much inconvenience infringes upon freedoms. told I'm Miami that's true either part. park walk takes like 10 minutes south beach. also open 7 days. true county wide. say caused race, said correlated race, also correlated COVID mortality rates. Yep, would prefer taking chances avoid it. Beaches boardwalks packed New Jersey since Memorial Day, cases still going down. don’t think we’re seeing lag phase month, probability virus really doesn’t spread well outdoors. 

Restaurants, bars, whatnot stayed open south, people generally dumber probably accounts cases. Nothing, short vaccine highly effective therapeutics. Trump allies kept touting banning flights China. good buy time. 

But time brought trillions dollars? little. wasted along thousand lives. shame! see mechanism acting people know formed opinion. skeptical government establishment healthy and, might add, dutiful, real conspiracies things disinformation propaganda, many people forget skeptical sources information well, many believe whoever goes grain, contradict mainstream view, look qualifications ulterior motives, drink up, long official source good enough. went grocery store last Sunday half people masks. I'm Texas. see we're fucked. yes, wear mask. Imagine dumb average person is. half population dumber that.  madness. actually got that? son applied got nothing.  pull credit reports ignore medical stuff. Unless need follow care I'd tell em pound sand. Yes one county represents country lol.  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

So lie Exactly Billy Strings AMAZINGLY talented. He’s thrash metal guitar player plays doc Watson level 

Wait, what??? ever record metal albums? I'd love hear that. Strings' incredibly talented. would like suggest alternative framing.

Most spread caused people work everything reopened.

We blame spread stupid people - account little spread - donor class wants hate them.

We systemic problem politicians interested safety, they've reopened prematurely without adequate safety plan.

Most people want reopen work right now. people know virus scary would rather lockdown. They're getting infected work risk infecting family political leaders feeding us wolves.

They're blame.

Any asshat understand terrifying virus confused billion dollar misinformation campaign highlighted political incompetence.

Of course people going confused. CDC reversed majority claims they've made. parents. work.

And everywhere else would normally need look kids.

Elementary school high school (for better worse) giving children somewhere go day. Learning ""daycare"".

If parents need work, without school many trouble. 

It puts lot stress caregivers kinds lose daily schooling. Yeah right! keep getting shocked things expect see. No. nowhere near half. keeping touch relatives friends online coronavirus almost 9 10 us (30 current time) after-effects virus.

Do people effects? Yes nowhere near half. Maybe bare 1%.

My one relative high blood pressure blamed CoVid doctor hospital said ""Wait damned minute, I've years!"" him.

Is serious disease? Yes. serious elderly 60? Yes, want try prevent people getting it.

Does cause extreme after-effects half people get it? blunt period done ""No!""

By way: virus myself. parents died virus (they 69 mother never gotten first place).

So speak subject personal experience. bad it? would call symptoms light severe (no breathing issues) since made unable walk 2 days.

Do after-effects now? No. thing still 'strange' blood pressure mainly due stress dealing parent's deaths problems estate. sounds like lot work. someone else take credit, know true American way Newsom pretty well beginning, think gave pressure reopen crowd, unfortunately. look case counts time, never really flattened curve. Cases going consistently since March. Eva Pharma said Thursday begun producing Remdesivir Favipiravir, two drugs used treatment patients indicated moderate severe cases COVID-19 patients intensive care require oxygen, Favipiravir indicated mild moderate Pharma, generic drugmaker established 1997, said earlier month received licence Gilead Sciences Inc make Remdesivir Egypt distribute 127 countries. lost popular vote. 2.8 million votes.

That’s fair team? happens entire offense team gets it? happens coach gets ends hospital months? happens star player gets permanent lung damage can’t ever play football again?

All ifs possible scenarios matter much protect quarantine themselves. mention that’s thousands people stay away family, friends, loved ones months. Meanwhile people complaining lockdown couldn’t see loved ones like two months, everyone talking much mental health effected without social contact.

Lol, Jesus fact upvoted sub nobody takes seriously. Good thing Trump handled pandemic perfectly China done poorly /s main state specific pages, scroll down. 7 day rolling average line include generally smooths “day reporting” issues. fAKE! Maybe let Darwin drive ship? basically saying wear mask public hearing newscast ends takes mask!!! Yes that's true think mean currently China recommitting lockdowns new cases Correct, (if memory serves) mid April end July, unemployed people entitled normal state unemployment plus additional 600/wk federal government. state Michigan, means get somewhere $750 $962 per week. describing life unemployment like 6 months ago. unemployment 2 months alabama 200 bucks week so. got job. funny poorer southern states brimming people social welfare ""strap boots up"" kind people when, reality, they're ones getting welfare most. amazing ignorant moronic people are. ahh Alabama course! anyone surprised stopped funny everything trash. go live burbs Chicago fiber internet blows True, lot places didn’t many restrictions, quite few. know nothing like European approach, city shut pretty hard (by US standards) - restaurants take only, nonessential business open (that slightly eased bit May), gatherings allowed, etc. June 3, no, good time. Hell, never even got point opening beaches, cities closing them. us eager go back. fair that's exactly people sickness, feel fine enough they're going. US probably never recover this. many dumb people. many die much people unable work serious longterm health issues. hope masks worth mindless animals.  Like saying goes... ""the people meet, like dogs"" what’s alternative? Isn’t fast the”Until death us part” part? mean winning? USA USA USA!   think said article might little old, articles came sub said “the best case scenario October” I’m still rooting end summer least know it’s going work think better bulletproof vest COVID-19 USA. every level there's prohibitive profiteering going completely undermines attempt combating COVID-19. funding engineering COVID-19 sleeper cells across USA made people simply can't afford medical detection treatment. people say every time there's Republican office.

Otherwise, yes, every service sector job pretty hammered right new jobs. Stop. Enabling. Them.

Stop hanging them. need feel consequences morons Lmao insanely ridiculous comment.

The United States excellent example build first world country, PRIME example build first world country.

The United States grew collection settlers powerful country world 100 years - small fraction total existence European Asian countries.

This opinion ""America embarrassment world"" pure propaganda (most likely) Europeans Asians upset United States remains sovereign nation 2020. mean, “left right two sides cracked coin” thing often brought people see insanity government. 

Yet one party actively gay people equality protection, interest healthcare reform outside repealing assistance keeps medical care bankrupting poor people, saw need police reform claims institutional racism isn’t thing, doesn’t believe global warming anthropogenic think need take seriously enough make changes, actively downplaying COVID19 pitting world making us look incompetent, etc. 

The American Left perfect don’t support agree every ideal carry, going back list resting first point (actively fighting gay people), could never consciously support party. 

So yes, they’re flawed one clearly worse fundamental level. Even agreed conservative viewpoints could good conscience support party would indirectly supporting (IMO) immoral rhetoric. mean link u put stats coronavirus (which experts agree correlate highly states reopening) wikipedia protests. None evidence. Dallas. Masks well worn opened shit back weeks ago. everyone threw masks started living like virus magically fucking gone. idiot work basically like ""All bar crawling friends getting covid! hehe!"" rarely wearing mask. Thankfully work different department told entire sales team work home. thought something immunity supposed happen 60% population. don’t think yet. YEEEEEEHAW! Yep. received scathing review Ms. Nope, Nope resident 555 Fuckoff way, Leavenworth WA. Ya know, keep hearing much kids school hurts many ways, yet personally know 8 people home schooled, went college successful now. Hell, I'd argue home schooling helped public schools helped many know.

When comes there's one reason schools want reopen. $. I’m retail busy place dreading day reopen. city mask ordinance yay!!! Safer me.

Except.

Like far many places there’s absolutely enforcement built it.

Posted elsewhere, want drive point home shitty FL leadership citizenry dirty systematically misleading public:

They fired data manager would fudge numbers, using misleading data.

────────

""When went show report card would say county, among things, asked delete report card showed counties, pretty much, ready reopening,"" says. ""And want draw attention that.""

Jones says superior asked open data alter numbers state's coronavirus positivity rating would change 18% 10% — state would appear meet target reopen.

""To me, read like kind political conspiracy higher directive,"" Jones says. ""It seemed like people expected brought results, results support plan written, not, seemed panicked, like figure way make results match plan.""

────────

She says state's dashboard, person tests positive counted positive test once, matter many times test positive. person tests negative counted time test negative coronavirus. Jones says many residents, health care workers, require repeated testing, state's dashboard artificially deflating true positivity rate. ""They're adding total test figures instead total people, makes percent positive extremely low,"" Puts different light happened Chris Benoit. college towns? Seriously, theres foreign leadership reading this, please boycott/embargo trump. really care less downvotes. elderly stay frick home allow young, much less likely problems virus, live lives.

Again, logic flawed. happens young person gets accident needs ICU bed, beds filled older folks? 

Your responses typical lot Americans, selfish ill informed. Epic good revenue cycle meh clinical documentation really depends specialty. People want wear.a mask, may ""pro trump"", 
But certainly pro virus.
The science in, masks save lives, stubbornness harm ones love. probably taste great. Like hate vitriol. Bruh Fauci right. FUCKED. Nearly 50,000 cases day?! Happy end first half 2020, may second half kill us quickly get with... sure. Flattening curve really change area curve. Right confirmed-infection fatality rate 5%. we're confirming 20% infections (possibly much higher) puts infection fatality rate 1%. Suppose half America gets infected. 150M people infected 1% 1.5M deaths. question when. time next year? !RemindMe 12 Months Yeah took second figure out. click bars becomes obvious it’s poorly laid chart overall. shutdown order came down, sent everyone home kept paying them. CARES act passed unemployment increased substantially, put everyone temporary lay-off. Michigan, although fired - would still file themselves, did. Now, we're slowly ramping bringing people back. 49 employees total, we've asked 35 return 9 declined. 5 9 flat said reason, suspect 4 reason (though smartly give one).  mean, point every man himself, risk stay home, arent go out, whatever, America obviously doesnt care. cant beat virus without vaccine.

People say wearing mask lowers oxygen something I'm working 6 hours day factory AC, wear mask day easily. Get working hospitals, medic training all.

It might open eye situation hand. Lol, ""problem solved."" Person walks mask. Employee tells leave put mask. say no. Employee says call police trespassing. say no. Employee calls police. Person shops 30 minutes concerning customers employees. Cops arrive. Customer puts mask on. Problem solved? Well hold there. love music ain’t talking replacing confederate statues Dolly music. She’s done enormous amount charity work including free books every child TN 6. 

I’ve got family around pigeon forge. Dolly Parton saved livelihood responsible basically everyone else’s home town. literally can’t overstate much good done decades active charity work campaigning everything including gay rights decades wasn’t trendy. 

Sorry there’s one Dolly Parton she’s national treasure. Here’s favorite Casey musgraves video, hope makes rant. basically saying stupid understand simple statement fault... Oh my, wonder you‘re assuming Americans think Germans idiots.

The in-crowd southern states wearing mask whatever stupid reason (WHY governors elected mandate beyond me), honestly people around start wearing one, even ""but constitutional right wear one"" people start to. want fit in. People like Trader Joe's Karen go viral people want her, start wearing one. may take little elbow grease south get there, absolutely bit peer pressure. [public persuade 20150614, nothing will.

Either USA greatest country ever existed (no) USA worst shithole planet (no). Try nuance either position people immediately assume hold polar extreme. Instead of, know, looking things shades grey. 

Applies _a lot_ topics, serious ones innocent ones. Perhaps OP post summary key points? tool takes long time load appear work. shows correct COVID-19 infection rates instead raw totals. much better way assessing risk community. way around actually.

Of 10,575 PCR tests, 3 positive nationwide representative coronavirus screening May involving nearly 18,000 people, Béla Merkely, rector Semmelweis University (SE), head clinical epidemiology team, announced press conference results Wednesday.

Béla Merkely described: proportion active infections confirmed PCR test 0.029 percent, estimated number infected people 2421 time study. gave sample, 70 seropositive cases found, based 0.68 percent Hungarian population, 56,439 people, could contracted infection 16 May.

He added 2 3 positive cases hospitalized disease time sampling.

Of ten thousand people, 2.9 active illnesses 68 contracted infection.

Kornélia Mag, Vice-President Central Statistical Office (CSO), said 17,787 people age 14 living private households 489 settlements selected sample.

Of these, ""frame error"" 2315 people, died, moved abroad institution; 3135 people could contacted refused participate study.

The questionnaire part study completed 12,236 people, 1,0,575 people went virus antibody RNA test. also questionnaires tests 10,474 cases. participation rate thus 67.7 percent.

Ervin Berényi, President Clinical Center University Debrecen, said questionnaire asked respondent met person subject quarantine. Based this, 114 10,000 estimated number met quarantined person went disease 66 number seropositive among quarantined contact.

He noted number people infected also high among answer question, may explained fact people reluctant admit may become infected contacts.

Andor Sebestyén, President Clinical Center University Pécs, explained participation rate Veszprém, Nógrád, Szabolcs-Szatmár Békés counties 74.6 per cent Pest county outstanding, exceeding 75 per cent.

He added counties participation around 60 percent, indicates whether Hungarian population curious whether infected.

Describing estimated transinfection data region, number PCR-positive cases 4.9 tens thousands Central Hungary, 2.2 tens thousands Great Plain Northern Hungary, 1.8 tens thousands Transdanubia. estimated number infected people 79 tens thousands Central Hungary, 67 tens Transdanubia 60 tens Great Plain Northern Hungary.

Csaba Lengyel, President Clinical Center University Szeged, said age characteristics: eastern part country elderly mainly infected, Transdanubian central region country young predominant among infected. may due ‘mobile’ group, also crosses border infected, living mainly western central regions.

The number infected people dominated 50, infected significant difference age group, said, adding ""the trend clearly towards older age group.""

The number men women almost same, ie infection rate Hungary affected gender, Csaba Lengyel added.

However, warned infection introduced countries could cause ""outbreak"" time, especially given high number infections neighboring countries, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Albania.

The H-UNCOVER study conducted SE, support Ministry Innovation Technology, leadership SE. ignorant selfish makes sick. 

First idiot downplays everything - gets criticised - fucks every nation could need too.

Yikes, may Corona get point. Less taxes, less spending

It work way. current strategy literally _Borrow Spend_. talking trillions. president wants giant infrastructure bill interest rates low. nearly 20 years internalized _Defecits Matter Anymore_. call _Moddrn Monetary Theory_ really level manipulation financial system would associate tin pot dictators.

The problem defects matter cumulative debt certainly future. early 90s national debt paralyzed political discourse country. happen gonna fucking suck.  people countries currently able keep stock masks without much difficulty. risks exist anytime players visit grocery store, come contact someone has? controlled environment would actually pose less risk. There's actually much higher risk star player getting attending contact someone attended local restaurant/store/etc. country's guidelines continue relax he'd catch bubble thousands isolated.

I'll put another way might easier understand. someone offered $480K+ year go play game, stipulation can't see family 6 months (or opt quarantine you), would consider large sacrifice make? so, could opt team. plenty waiting happily accept offer.

But staff?

The NFL multi-billion dollar industry, issues finding people want get foot door voluntarily quarantining 6 months bubble. like life outside bubble back normal anyway.

""Meanwhile people complaining lockdown couldn’t see loved ones like two months...""

What all? mandatory anyone take job. That's works - there's job specific criteria set compensation, make decision accept NOT. People oil rigs get paid far less, dangerous environments, need away loved ones extended periods time... making career CHOICE. 

""ALL entertainment. drink beer yell tv week. could cancel/postpone season...""

All what? isolating?

So ""you drink beer yell tv"" - people drinking beer yelling tv players paid millions dollars play game living. paid play game entertainment.

But hey, dangers exist. season can't played, everyone's yearly salary also postponed, right? See well goes over. bet they'd still want collect paycheck even though actually ""entertaining"" beer drinkers want yell TVs. Good. guy reelection again? fallout bad. Dying next day means Viral Load Groom spreading high. lot infected might die. Hello, add different perspective: 

I live Scotland day time nation’s leader, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, tv update people coronavirus death numbers. 

She even makes point distinguishing previous day’s numbers possibility numbers incorrect due hospitals care homes consolidated figures. 

It’s strange leaders elsewhere pressured update people figures. surprise due to? empirical proof answer? Wont happen mass wearing masks next 5 years. culture now, based states, need next 5 years Actually, many people paying attention. problem many people relatives, even elderly ones, gotten virus sickened relatives severely.

What people like us often fail realize 99%+ people get virus? 'just another flu'.

It unlucky like mother ones pre-existing conditions like father, died, exception rule here.

Until deal fact third sentence? going get traction making c***'s (you know term want use) religious zealots properly take disease seriously. bone broth tastes marvelous? America blessed politicians know COVID-19 better medical expert. number black men shot police year higher, literally advocating sacrifice thousands name dozen travesties. Tell dead people important social change was. difference police killings COVID deaths gap child's Lego building skyscraper. know people local school, mom friends teach 8th grade seriously looking retiring year online, absolutely stand sitting hours day downtime, take profession barely even time go bathroom classes, working 8 straight hours, make work 2-4 hours, going feel useless depressed. mom pretty depressed online schooling last semester, would hate see go again. blame government choices individual people. YEEEEHAWWUGH *COUGH COUGH COUUUGH* hope forgot /s bizarre probably awfully repeated metaphor going for, five students even write name paper that's alarming enough considered significant Saying hes always right except one time way imply 538 done poor job, poor job 2016. anything highlights exceptional nature election. 
 
This fine example current culture war environment anything perceive remotely negative interpreted critical whole comment dismissed jes' hatin' saying go? Live free or...die. 

Put mask on, people. respectfully apologize appreciate accept that. Understand recognize well remain lighter getting mind positive manor even thereafter removed. Thankful even still. well please beautiful new day. ♡ Question, Italy’s economy that? Great article, comrade /s Wait that’s real quote? thing happen Switzerland. Even still, significant number people states still act self-preservative manner. best guess see 190,000k deaths January 250,000 everything done  former military expected nothing less complete inability cope virus. set ways big fucking laugh considering pretend pride ability adapt changing situations. nephew appointment cancelled twice. runny nose. always runny nose, know he'll get year check up. Well, bet regret now. give hours looks it, people tried defend position, replied good counter points address flaws logic, instead replying, downvote me. 

One person says ""outdoor better indoor"" thats kind strawman. one said indoor better outdoor lol. march 50k people justified simply outdoor better indoor lol. study needed say 50k people marching no/little effect spread. reply, downvotes.

Another person says cause justified. like ok, virus care cause. acknowledge tens thousands people marching significantly increase spread? Literally discussing whether cause justified, point irrelevant pandemic. reply, downvotes. 

Someone else outlined argument, intellectually honest answer - acknowledged marches increase spread, supporters mind cost-benefit point view. first reply highlighted argument supporters maintaining integrity reply. 

Honestly thought sub place discuss, good faith, effects widespread protest curves. I've following guidelines ages now, hardly anyone (online guess) social circle follows them. I've used people saying ""masks matter"", ""I wanted see friends"", ""it's massive cover - hospitals empty"", ""the government enough/doing much"", ""its overreaction bro"", ""it kills old people 99% survive relax paranoid hypochondriac"", nice part online community acknowledges literally global pandemic, kills people, significantly irreversibly changes quality life lots previously healthy people get it. suddenly, community acknowledged this, (correctly) mocked showed concern towards freedom protesters, suddenly COMPLETE 180 support tens thousands people marching together?! absolutely crazy - humans gone completely crazy. thought ones could sensibly look things - appears not. Congratulations, Massachusetts! Seattleite here. Anyone else noticing correlation ability flatten curve educated population? deserve better Americans, really Yes neither things benefit anyone 1% fucking [redacted civility rule] I’m lansing we’re one lucky ones. Us too. Interesting school system (a pretty good one state) initially said online options without doctors note.

But 180 last Friday said would offer family wanted it.

I wonder many people feel way do?

Lots loud “go back normal” folks around here.

Federal Reserve already said safely print much money necessary; national debt money we've largely borrowed myself.

Money money. lockdown means people working, means they're whatever useful things they're paid do.

#Further restrictions consideration border regions

Ohisalo also said government ready consider whether stricter restrictions introduced regions along Swedish border, especially local health authorities consider action necessary.

**Earlier Friday, chief physicians western Finland appealed people avoid making unnecessary visits Sweden, shopping trips, situation improves.**

**During last two weeks, new cases coronavirus reported West Ostrobothnia Hospital District, traced back people making shopping trips Sweden.**

**""If health authorities consider situation bad, get similar messages Department Health Welfare Ministry Social Affairs Health, course, government, consider whether restrictions need introduced,"" Ohisalo said.**

It illustrates clearly Sweden causing harm Finland, article hints at. Yeah, really glad makes looking US stressful. Like looking people city million people people less loose action (going bars restaurants example) see news Texas, 2 6 new cases per day 40 active cases (with enough testing can't find anyone get tested nobody sick). watched game last weekend piped singing cheers boo's. weird could see stands empty. 

When watched last City game silent except players collapsed healthcare system price FREEDOM Anyone wanting free antibodies test currently healthy enough donate blood consider it. blood donation clinics testing covid prior procedure. I’m happy hear it, too, I’d love find projections turn high! That's simply true. firm messaging ""Stay home, save lives, protect NHS"" Boris got Coronavirus. Yeah, next thing know, they'll telling ladies can't bodies!...wait... Yes, can.  surprising all. Deaths rising [27% weeks, ultimately around 2 million people infected around start April. takes ~2 months 27% rate daily spread. developed sad, morbid obsession Coronavirus deaths U.S. today, stand approximately 129,000. None links say virus remains body indefinitely. actually read links? ""it happen me"" heard Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said?? look collateral damage side too. major cities, small cities, hospitals max capacity causing, continue cause, deaths people technically Covid-19 related. Think number type 2 diabetics, people severe heart problems, health issue die simply room people available care them. death rate never accurate. Also non-tipping types. positive rate give fuck anything political agendas.

Some people's political agenda, right now, literally, ""The virus overblown total hoax left asking wear mask totalitarian authoritarianism. need re-open bars malls immediately virus exists let take course.""

If people exist, yeah, probably see protests causing noticeable bump, would appear whatever bump caused completely buried factors causes like agenda. Also gyms full drunk people lowered social inhibition. can't speak I'm sure there's odd gym blurs line. You’re saying it’s small sample size like that’s news something Thanks info. Do... know people Europe already heard Jesus, need mission?

Jesus born Missouri. would believe told ‘just getting paid’ huge lever influence responsible decision? I'm sure California going lockdown August  want take rapid action now

No, *American* take rapid action

No, mean *real* American take action

No, dammit. mean actual real American take

Perfection. comparing H1N1 vaccine? two diseases way similar Ebola. Hugo’s. sadly, jerks said throwing racial insults employees too. Honestly, even children behave better... 9,999  Wow  Sanity reigns Canada. Ummm.... 
Helmets reduce risk death 37%

And reduce risk head injury  Nowhere. completely unscientific. US testing positive test rate 15% said. they're testing 7% positive rate still said. Brazil, nearly 50% positive test rate? Compare projected cases per I'm actually surprised California. 

Nothing surprising. curve flattened well CA even peaked yet new uptick. put things perspective, California become bad New York, would hit 62,000 deaths. hair 6,000.  Fauci already clarified need front line workers healthcare needed masks directed people public go buy masks. cannot definitively state uptick cases places anything bars open. Especially bars 25% capacity. way many factors play.

You're right, better shut safe. over, bet we’re gonna see much reporting fraud Covid death case coding get Medicare reimbursements Schools out, kids bored home, sports parents bored sitting home well.

Yesterday supermarket heard cellphoner complaining listener spend much time around 3 children due school work. Don’t want spend 3 seconds putting mask argue 5 minutes everywhere go spend hours marching masks. reasonable people. mention people constantly talking bars, fill up, louder people talk. can't talk honestly openly risks virus?

Shhhhh..... state actual death rates vote down. :-) 

I tried compare discuss risks different activities life. very, precious people earth capable rational calm evaluating risk stats. saw current pandemic. even standard chart deaths carry around!

Heart Disease: 611,105 people per year

Cancer: 584,881 people per year

Hospital Error: 250,000 people per year - reference: http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/03/476636183/death-certificates-undercount-toll-of-medical-errors

Chronic Respiratory Disease (smoking): 149,205 people per year

Accidents (unintentional injuries): 130,557 people per year

Stroke: 128,978 people per year

Auto Accidents: 33,000 people per year

Gun SUICIDES: 21,175 people per year

Swimming Pool Drownings: 3,536 people per year

Gun accidentals: 700 people per year

Mass shootings: 28 people per year

So Coronavirus taking 200,000 new additional lives per year USA bad, sure. bad heart disease cancer year, trivial small either. try slot chart 99 100 people tar feather insensitive.

One observation: people get little rational enough time passed. try bring statistical chances death first week 9/11 first month pandemic FORGET IT, can’t break fear panic Neanderthal brain fight flight reaction. couple years later first time reach 5% population capable evaluating statistics calmly. races folks..... I'm clean almost like I'm gone. Darwin foundation gonna run awards year... blame lot sites use pop ups intrusive ads break viewer away story.

Hell, computer locked NYTimes once. Never again.. friend mine organizing memorial service recently deceased family member. anyone point guidelines resources organizing memorial services safely time coronavirus? issue that’s vaccination campaigns usually work. general healthy population one want become vaccinated. weak immune deficient higher chance complications vaccines. Herd immunity protects vulnerable people virus cannot spread nearly far population base immunity though either vaccination previous exposure resulting immune response.

The issue covid rushed vaccine world discussing dangerous could past 6 months. regard personally say it’s completely fine want get vaccine reason, complications completely plausible. that’s reason people won’t get vaccinated feel, anti mask rhetoric; good luck injecting shit people won’t put fucking cloth face. going happen. seen many dipshits unironically bought Bill Gates microchipping conspiracy, covid hoax, *it’s less deadly flu bro* people problem. Ignorance, cognitive biases plain completely uninformed issue.  Yeah, could one job provides everything family needed even several kids. Eh. Many parts Insurance good things. Even cremation costs $9,000. people can't afford family die. mention things like Housing Riders. Imagine spouse buy house year two later die. Without things like Housing Rider would booted house odds can't make regular housing payments one income bills care person dies still come. Money person saved going go probate family access deceased's funds pay things right away. $25,000 life insurance pay funeral student loans off. money spent pocket. 

Can people taking care estate cover EVERY piece debt moments notice?  sub first foremost political. spectrum workout program something? kinda called brainwashed coz linked European CDC datasets.....

Worth mentioning many years working hospitals published scientific papers. 

But I’m brainwashed one. Yeah. make sense ok.

Every state information workers wfh regardless rest population doing. governor's orders ensured never officially reach ICU capacity. People dying streets they'll still claim 3% ICU beds available continue elective procedures. calling ""telly"" dead rights evidence natural born American. MAYBE citizen, likely not. call ""telly' US. Everyone complete idiots. Conspiracy fake news, medical community.

This kind shit got Rush LIMPBALLS written it.

Fuckin draft dodger Probably dad. Remindme 4 weeks ! “Take personal responsibility!

Wait, no, me!” TOTALLY WORTH IT! Boomers. real “me” generation POS Rand Paul making asinine comments listening experts. Kinda bad comparison. Italy swamped well could test enough. Texas capturing lot cases Italy was. that's high bar setting xD Ooh interesting, care share link podcast name?  Yeah, would get stereotyped fat americans rely electric carts walmart guns house wearing masks wrongly public freedom giving shit public safety

Who would want kinds people country, _right_? I'm wondering, specifically ""out control"" mean, would look like day day basis? please stop feeding troll. person sub spouting crap. Oh, know that's why. rhetorical question. baffling. people damn stupid? get it. never will. durations human trials cut every phase 3 vaccine trial supposed good understanding disease trying prevent, including things like seasonal exposure prevalence population know yet. trials almost certainly prove safety, adverse effects tend happen early, efficacy duration immunity largely ""dunno, pretty good think"", propose start manufacturing moving phase 3 without even publishing *preliminary* results phases 1 requirement vaccine trial. Normally save fair, although would think trial level scrutiny would published *something* phase 1 trials. said Even data monkey trials peer reviewed read them. They're published.

Published preliminary results. peer reviewed.

All I'm saying want see data. I'm concerned much pressure (political monetary, well desperately wanting help people) science rushed. whom? Certainly black folks. Unless people running Houston's hospitals stupid, non emergency cases gone now. north 30% usual occupancy. cannot definitively state uptick cases places anything bars open. Especially bars 25% capacity. way many factors play.

This anecdotal, scientific. Oooo. Much better! Approved!!! Well hope you’re right, don’t see happening. enough drug Remdesevir even approved Europe year. Thus US doses Europe means produce enough people time. gets nursing homes overwhelm ICUs, you’ll see deaths spike can’t believe opening schools. going play Kenny Loggins 'Highway Danger Zone' approach church? I've always prescribed idea ever asking question, ""Why can't people just...?"" really understand people. free frustrated, change reality. People won't. constraint must work solve problem unless want turn military state.

As strategy, 3 month strict lockdown really accomplish anything country. cannot eliminate virus. Even said R0 dropped 0.5, we'd still easily 15,000+ cases US, probably much R0 dropping 0.5, people it. opened up, would spread again, we'd lost 3 months people's livelihoods relatively little gain.

The better approach titrate spread. state decides 4-5 phase plan slowly works phase. reach phase spread starts increasing exponentially again, back previous phase live phase find vaccine treatment makes increased spread tolerable.

In places like Florida, Texas, California, need reinstate lockdowns lower cases since let get high again. need done places cases already low, like New York, Vermont, Connecticut, Hawaii, West Virginia, etc...

This approach maximizes economic activity, absolutely necessary public health reasons, preventing spread ever going exponential. Lockdowns fantastic tools, need end goal, otherwise mindless suffering. Meanwhile, county's health department taking seriously. got inspected day reopened dining room. boss (the owner) (general manager) walk inspector entire dining room explain procedures implementing employees demonstrate procedures without guidance either us. back house also inspected compliance new COVID standards.

The inspector also made clear that, received complaint, dining room would ordered shut pending another inspection. guys’s thoughts Christmas? year I’m going boyfriend house, hopefully parents don’t invite brother sister house police going stop rioting without fight.  expected failed contain virus? plague ""disappeared"" killing 1/3 (please check numbers I'm sure) Europe's population time. 
Maybe that's ""goal"" - honestly doubt guy think breakfast lunch, knows chemically induced reactions 3 synapses tanning spray Hahahah
This fucking hilarious absurd even start building large scale field hospitals yet? know Abbott mentioned couple months back figured plans put hold since started reopening working virus endemic.

That's easier contact trace end lockdown. area also discovered asymptomatic people lockdown reason.

Returning lockdown several weeks - would much stricture lockdown Wuhan Lombardi demonstrated - would reduce speed virus substantially contact tracing would much effective.

Right now, patients idea gave them, when, where. contact hundreds thousands strangers dozens locations. Reduce number strangers 30 people contain it.

This Wuhan demonstrated forced quarantine facilities. people idea sick hard get tests. they'd grocery runner essential worker.

Another thing that's different regional symptom thing. easier screen COVID-19 questions based regional symptoms. Like diarrhea common symptom. Fever, diarrhea, test. we've got COVID toes one, fever shits another, mild coughing fourth.

Now everyone comes needs tested including car wreck Karen. Get kids house adults get back work, work, work. rich controllers basically asked lose election wallets Might 50k think. barn* nearby, know, fire, fully engulfed, horse got out? 




*United States, clarity. them, replying pretty specific statement. Thanks explanation apologies wasting time, layman knows next nothing medical profession statement seemed jarring me. helped me, much appreciated everything much appreciated! 

Hope goofy soon depends. hospital stipulation “separations” can’t rehired least six months. sure, might able work another hospital, pretty much everyone wasn’t hiring freeze right now. new employees take time train orient.

Plus laid (and nurses around general) intending leave bedside nursing together. Largely due unsafe PPE staffing conditions hospitals way handled all. realized disposable hospital admins refused provide adequate PPE started laying experienced nurses pandemic.

The “experienced” part actually really important. Ideally hospital nice mix experience levels among staff. newer nurses important, everyone starts somewhere, it’s absolutely unsafe many one floor given time. I’ve nurse 5 years, times I’m senior nurse floor 7 nurses less 2 years experience (with 3-4 fresh new grads year). It’s absolutely terrifying super stressful person nurses come help questions. God forbid something major happens. new people 2 year contracts, experienced nurses ones let go. It’s funny “Black Lives Matter” wants save black lives “Bar Lives Matter” wants end bar lives. small town couple thousands true. larger scale, work Sweden. ended yet NYC 20% antibodies (from hard hit community, likely much lower whole city). good strategy small population illusion nation world. That's actually terrifying many wearing masks? comment saw said May 31. sure that’s cleared June.  Bahaha yes great realized didn’t cover pimple make put mask instead. last swine flu pandemic didn't. Well, would argue I'm substituting actual evidence possibilities.

You're citing source raises hypotheticals ""it ***can*** take several weeks"" ""the data shown page ***may*** incomplete"", ""will ***likely*** include ***all*** deaths occurred given time period"". 

Again, New York look terms long actually takes states report deaths. deaths get reported within day two.

Is possible Florida reported huge number deaths? Sure. they're reporting 20-30 deaths day. actually kind crisis talking based case counts, deaths would underreported multiple hundreds percent.

Is possible? Sure. Likely? No. difference understanding possible likely called judgment. Let's make viral week. although april, nyc seeing doubling 4-5 days. Try harder zona. live Virginia went underfunded poor person clinic get tooth removed blood work done day. require everyone take drive antibody test within three days appointment, took hour take test give certificate acknowledging results. schedule well make efficient, time waiting results. live fantasy bro  Like Maine too. It’s either enforced honor system businesses think might lack education personal responsibility. later hasn’t American virtue strive to, unfortunately.  several hospitals city Nashville TN. stay anti mask refuse take seriously see live chopper cams people crowding streets outside hospitals begging get in. then, stick masks ass. place Id comply wear mask would airplane, dont fly time soon. still personally know ONE Corona yet among friends family. 221 FB family, friends, former coworkers, one former classmate 5th grade finally mentioned last week childrens father go hospital Corona. Aside that, many others see death rate eyes, nowhere near high enough want wear mask work outside anywhere.  * Can't exactly argue first point lets act like investors big ass part price labeling
* unlike everyone else sans Brazil others, take seriously/still taking seriously + ill-equipped deal due mistakes (HC system, wage gap, etc). Seriously can't act fool endanger country countries (travel, business, etc) even complete dick saying ""fuck you, got mine"". countries took seriously mean need drug, virus gone away. countries citizens willing take proper precautions part hence rates going stable. anything countries took seriously able get treatment first wasting people refused give shit others breathe damn tube. Fuck Boris UK trials treatment, idk go ""lol fair bc America"" look that. Sure fuck system allowing thing real fuck
* yes please see last 2 points + still justify US hogging treatment stock
* LMAO cannot serious think actually serves correctly. get wrong Trumpsters good trait show FUCK polls, can't act like Trump literally 1) give personal fuck rest world 2) try save wealthiest supporters bc avg american give limbs pay treatment.

TLDR Seriously another American, i'm asking please stop fucking talking said months ago dumb orange Yeah dont leave train still fine think individuals deserve it... also shows people really know looked really closely data decided would worthwhile investment.

You don’t sink billions dollars something “Hope” works. sink “your pretty damn sure it’ll work” good, exemptions:  cannot wear mask due health conditions disability,  age 6,  restaurant patrons eating drinking,  school staff members,  safety employees first responders,  exercising outdoors indoors least 6 feet away others,  religious facility. Yeah mentality culture USA work oneself death always incredibly busy tired soo bizarre. 

People would go crazy wonderfully relaxed lifestyles people developed nations. ""Don't worry babe, need condom. I'll pull out"" method, results unintended babies. facepalm.jpg thought moron said virus going disappear? 

Thousands people infected hour 70 iq dumbass forgotten charge. *are* inconvenience, one blinders can't see that, say disagree restrictions, said *only thing that's effect me*, there's difference. also yet provide literally reason upset I've able keep job this. bad? can't make claims ""logical arguments work you"" everything said far devoid logic all.

Turn Twitter Fox news, read something. vaccine made pfizer also showed promising results [actual CLINICAL (take notes, moderna).

That's saying isn’t flu. isn’t seasonal. Flu changes strains. Maybe someone Fauci (as much like him) make case. live SF, ordering takeout/delivery favorite places want survive. 

My question, help? I've read restaurants make lot money specific items like alcohol soda, desserts, etc....which people get much order delivery. HeAt KiLlS ViRuS lot people still working home, too, indefinitely.

Even though state mostly open now, things quite normal. lot restaurants still limiting indoor seating spacing tables, people still staying home much possible. Hospitals still limiting visitors. people wearing masks. yet we’re still seeing surge. Think bad things could get schools sports start back up? school isn’t even back yet. Overweight obese folks need try intermittent fasting. CA. wear one maintain unable consistently maintain distance six feet individuals memebers household."" brought good idea. Perhaps wear funky nasty smelling cologne, would keep away. truly shocking development. /s reasonable assume today? 

There's little data presented article. (Or others like it.) best, collection patient experiences disease, still progress. 

There's comment says view shared respect scientific consensus. scientific consensus mid-to-long-term impact Covid-19. There's spotty data, nothing close agreement means. anyone know Texas fudging deaths numbers? obvious looking case counts I'm sure they're it. think biggest problem Newsom lot governors face states cant survive huge hits tax revenue. Unlike federal government states can't print money prop businesses and/or keep people home. massive layoffs public sector workforce pretty soon way avoid it. allowing businesses remain open less hard hit areas state softens loss tax revenue.

If feds stepped gave states bailouts California would able extend lockdowns entire state. probably right. fuckwit also waiting see. Pennsylvania too. No, would still expect today :-/ I'm MA, living Nebraska. bad gets, makes happy family there. one Home Depot wearing masks (or anywhere matter), employees either wearing noses complaining customers wear them. Apparently later. title click bait. could thing dental cleaning stuff. also, everyone following social distance order, risk getting disease also reduced start with. waiting couple months get vaccine isn’t big issue. fell courier truck. media real story. reality horrific. Medical wast shit floors horrific won’t last. *Scared Texan noises* feel like time alarmed long passed.... actually fascinating possibly incredibly valuable scientific point view: incredibly rare instance cluster tied outdoor event that's well-documented.

For long time now, know SARS-CoV-2 transmissions much rarer outdoors. still happen. finding whatever factors made particular backyard party dangerous—dangerous enough overcome mitigating factors outdoors—could teach us lot preventing spread COVID-19.

Unfortunately, people involved clammed up, fear jeopardizing rich socialite reps. even count many people got sick! Social media posts related event taken down. seems unlikely party guests would cooperate scientific investigation.

What know:

A photographer sent magazine said people stood far apart mingling.

But people sit together tables multi-course meal.

Ashley, possibly index patient, returned party already happening. may key within hours dinner, began showing symptoms diagnosed shortly thereafter. Others sat table rumored also tested positive return calls declined comment.

So maybe that's key? maybe first onset symptoms someone peak infectiousness? even outdoors can't mitigate fact people around someone like hours, eating drinking close quarters.

And maybe factors come together often, hear outdoor clusters.

But wish could know cluster: I'd like know sure mainly guests table got sick. anything else together, perhaps indoors? Good know even knows compliant people North America believe FREEDOM infect others fucking idiots. Translation: 


**The waiting time surgery increases covid-19**

The waiting time planned operation increased three months since middle March care forced re-prioritize due covid-19. major repercussions operation queues fall, according Gunnar Enlund, deputy controller Sweden's perioperative register.

\- difficult overlook, would think round numbers three months longer waiting time looks like right now. since seen start autumn either, says Gunnar Enlund, chief physician Akademiska hospital deputy registry controller Sweden's perioperative registry.

In mid-March, covid-19 began take care resources, 113,000 people waiting surgery. Three months later - week midsummer - queue grown almost 60 percent - 180,000 people.

**Above all**, orthopedic surgery - knee, foot hip joints postponed. even ear, nose throat problems, gallbladder groin hernia wait.

How long suffer longer waiting times surgery difficult know. Gunnar Enlund again:

\- return normal capacity would still able start reducing queues. Since reduced holidays four three weeks, unpaid holiday debt autumn, plus staff tired exhausted different ways, sick leave number may also increase.

That worries little total capacity look like fall. umm, no, multiple studies. older, within last days. 

But here's thing - I've linked multiple studies. linked none, zero, zip, zilch, nada. 

Do ANY, evidence all? anything look at? give jim bob deliverance counting something, I'll look it. far, INCREDIBLY one-sided, give links studies given evidence support arguments all. I'm saying can't control everything. People going get it, closing select businesses whim government trying show ""doing something"" might prevent people coming in, *definitely* destroy business utterly. already businesses never open people never work again. Damn close sure. docs say this? given name condition? anyone else feel like going get worse again? 
Here bad USA live thought well (we last state lift restrictions) 

We started relaxing restrictions lifted (mostly due travellers) we've huge increase cases point certain postcodes lockdown again

Other states lot better reopening (including opening borders) feeling going get worse even though looks promising (for states)

I know mutated virus deadly (just contagious), yet considering state big rise cases, lot linked travelling surprised did. shit show federal response perspective....smh sure enjoy people suffering Quarantine baking got really popular hot minute spring. Yeast sold place. #SpotTheAltRightSheep long bodies infect keep going. hold breath what? schools going open? They're going be. next month. Pandemic pay ending gonna start pay full year parents stay home kids

My question would school open pro sports? gonna continue play little games shut certain parts society others political points end result same. Beaches shut 4th, hear? Bars closed again. mean silly know think governors want lockdown July 4 holidays sake.

Which literally insane given governors clearly learn Memorial Day.

At rate, even covid dies due lockdowns, idiots think everything's back normal time Labor Day. predict another peak around then, followed yet another shutdown. According Netherlands currently considering amendment patent law allow compulsory licensing remdesivir. also stated various media European countries still sufficient supply. run out, they’ll source elsewhere - likely much lower price. said multiples times, Europe, stop comparing america prices

I wonder paying employees covid tests doubt providing health insurance. would need vaccine order that. right? younger people Florida right now? saying younger people ones infected right florida similar rule Illinois, north enforcing it, us south/central sadly aren't. don't, way shape form, believe economy important people. need re-impose restrictions lockdowns, should. specifically referring question multi-year lockdown work, answer system built handle that. I'm defending said system fact, I'm identifying work without fundamental reform entire country.

Also, economic ramifications lockdown \*very\* different war economy. we're faced would basically throttle production unprecedented amount time. That's happened WWII, transition economy built wartime production. People still jobs, different jobs. That's would happen situation - design - everyone would stay homes.

You know COULD do? Suspend rent mortgage payments months, shut every single thing except basic infrastructure food access, give everyone couple thousand dollars months stayed home (actually stayed home) let infected cases recover spread plummet. for-real, one go anywhere lockdown removing financial stress would typically come along it. 


 would cost us trillions, we've already blown trying failing prop stock market. might put us least place could ride rest contact tracing, mask wearing, physical distancing vaccine arrived. course we're going try anything like that, unfortunately we've built country concepts equated tyranny. also noted 362 dollar amount state Michigan that, state Michigan. many states dollar amount Federal $600 dollars pulled around $100/week. Tell Governor Lt. Governor. implemented half-assed measures blitzed re-opening instead vigilant looking data. Definitely could copied NY's model SMART reopening. significant portion population refuse vaccine. difference make.

Also, importantly, completely made figures. 

Measles *[currently](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt07-measles.html#description)* death rate two three deaths may occur every 1,000 reported measles cases. that's post-vaccine. 

And prior vaccine US 1 every 6,000, 1/12. completely made numbers up. decade 1963 vaccine became available, nearly children got measles time 15 years age. estimated 3 4 million people United States infected year. Also year, among reported cases, estimated 400 500 people died, 48,000 hospitalized, 1,000 suffered encephalitis (swelling brain) measles. www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html   Ohio good first caved Reopen Die mob.

Now bill coming due. Good luck Ohio, beat let go. someone got lots dna points clarify here, look Arizona numbers gobsmackingly high compared peak surge states already surge. roof high. logical mind takes reminds March early April states getting peak numbers reaaaaally hard get test, many many cases went undetected. *true* numbers infected way higher, testing widely available Arizona actually detecting people hidden earlier surge states.

But % positivity states missing cases peak around 15-20-25%. Arizona is. Arizona catching testing proportion cases states March/April. still getting waaaay higher numbers. fucked. fucked. problem. carry shit parents, grandparents, anyone else come contact with. Selfish, reckless, ignorant. God hates us. Smh San Diego checking in. I'm scared AF, going NOWHERE weekend, except pick muthafuckin carnitas joint 1 block away, bring home, get drunk, watch Independence Day.  fatality rate 1%, 88 deaths 8800 cases 3-4 weeks ago. 124 deaths correlating whatever amount new cases 3-4 weeks ago. point making political benefit. Whether using place blame using sway opinion. scientific health crisis. entire country, regardless R, handled horribly. population messed up.

The one thing could helped nationwide order. That's huge mistake. reason order given political reasons. fact lives stake worried politics science problem. Politics never mattered less lifetime, yet every government official America citizen seems focused entirely political implications policy decisions.

Save God damn lives. care letter tout.  Russia helping countries US buying Remdesivir themselves...The world become upside swabs, masks discarded. shut reason mind thought SF South Florida say y’all fine lol HA thought clickbait too? read quote twice because. I've lived multiple states US. currently live Arizona. state motto ""You ain't boss me. want."" Arizonians keen government control, even lockdown, people actually abiding it. much changed since COVID started.

The issue lot cities seen huge influx tourism. town one I'm close border. People states tired lockdown drove Arizona vacation. Da yoopers get still get blasted. Extremely misleading article, also drove LBJ yesterday article makes seem like mad house honestly looked normal, actually emptier usual. think Mexican consulate frantic people get tested LBJ. They’re referring economic activity ticked since stay home orders started lifted. Recessions defined using rate growth GDP, actual value GDP WEREN’T?!?!?!! Goldman Sachs got knew n95 useful. knew pandemic inevitable eventually. Epic fail n95 stockpile supply chain, normal citizens able find shelves now. It’s weird, would thought we’d see spike people peacefully hanging walking together shouting stuff. don’t think true actually. live Arizona. Last looked around, anyone get test now. wait insanely long car neighborhoods, get test. 

I think means is, you’re Arizona you’re sick, high chance indeed COVID-19. high chance common cold, example.

The fact mass testing it’s coming back high terrifying. Thank you. Patrick Henry say thing?  Coronavirus provide latter half...   got numerous grocery stores work. There’s tons signs doors windows saying mask required, big stand sign most. 

But you’ll store director standing door greeting customers greet people without masks like normal say anything. pains me. Isn’t ironic. Remdesevir prophylaxis? Isn’t one really long half life? realized today-

Anti-mask people genuinely believed state governments going nothing hospitals filled started rationing care.

I struggling comprehend level delusion pandemic given us front row seat Darwinism. 1 star report. Lyft made sign wearing mask could book trip. guy driving. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* happening lot places. Texas isn’t unique, overwhelmingly ignorant seems. Plenty ignorant apples spiking bunch though. WHO. outdoor event birthday. (This May stay-at-home order lifted.) Started friend taking separate cars favorite restaurant takeout ate nearby park. spent day driving separate cars see outdoor art -- building murals -- around town.

Then came back place couple friends came sat least 6 feet apart eating meal prepared.

One unexpected note neighbor saw told corona birthday. He's professional singer serenaded Happy Birthday across street. brought piece birthday cake slipped garage door.

No one touched one another. one came house. literally showered finished cooking plating dinner.

And one got sick. five day treatment plan? Sounds like damn vacation fair, mask protects people far wearer. Damn TX went green red one month. Cray. tends happen public lied to.... Oh wish true. even many health experts reluctant speak politically incorrect truth risks protesting one specific cause (a full about-face excoriation tiny Reopen protests weeks difficult betrayal science ""experts"" comprehend, difficult imagine people's concern social distancing would diminished seeing crowds thousands universally *praised* day day risks downplayed, mentioned eventually get results...but goddamit, people need start leading example. People listen avoid listening what’s convenient themselves. It’s amazing people try use things said 2+ months ago ignore stuff experts say today it’s good argument. still much learn virus beginning didn’t want health care workers access masks, it’s pretty simple. virus showing people’s lack compassion others lives/health selfishness. It’s simple tbh wear mask keep others safe quit whining it. [India classified developing specified \*developed\* country  Cool cool cool, point inventing Time Travel seems likely US getting Covid control, I’ll get cracking. can't believe people letting Elon Musk get away behavior. things Uber gets skewered for, like joining Trump's economic panel, treating workers ""poorly"", Musk exactly same. Trump's economic panel continues treat workers like shit. fact, said time time coronavirus nothing, forcing workers keep working threat getting fired.

And yet everyone brushes forgets it. crazy me. numbers wrong unless saying .02% forget name read multiplication taco spot Cali closing time due amount conflicts employees getting customers masks. basically boiled putting employees risk this.

Edit: meant write multilocation I'm happy multiplication tacos  well, historically outbreaks indeed sort disappeared Tear gas every one them. That’s protesters right? stupidity US citizens never ceases amaze me.

Can confirm: live US That's argument UI stimulus check good. 

Unemployment benefits great, like said discourages people looking jobs short term.  protections need put place defend free market.

Monopolisation anti-capitalistic prevented. Seriously. like slasher movie yelling ""DO GO THERE!"" bunch horny teenagers. producing vaccine, producing glass vials, tubing, syringes, etc. get people. numerous articles explaining this, recently last week. Even vaccine fall, physically means transport administer it. No, ME/CFS post viral fatigue. pain symptoms real, cant measured easily even kernel suspicion it’s respiratory virus, masks mandatory it’s discovered otherwise. That’s actually supposed work real life healthcare. live nation imbeciles think don’t want shutdown without serious support, likely isn’t coming.

We saying Plus really make work, we’d need hard lockdown, far fewer essential categories.

Indeed. Yes. W. Africa hardly would call 'the end earth'. would like Cape Good Hope Tierra del Feugo. Maybe Berring Islands. LOL hear lot people talk, he's much...basically tyrannical dictator keeping people beaches. Idiots yet states eerily similar shape. agree Texas Arizona handled much worse. regardless state handles it, ultimately public stop COVID spreading, public states failed. No. US never were. Good. I'm sure I'd go far, thanks lot grooms brides spent months preparing, spent tens thousands dollars, would eat costs whole process cancel. It’s pathetic normal citizens still unable buy n95 better masks anywhere months. Unacceptable. 🖕😷🖕 I'm imagining shriek Hank Hill makes.  LMAO KNOWS dead seen end war New Crowded market, still

Nope kids put jail. long time. Well, wrong. need reopen Disney world, perhaps sea finally reclaim Florida. I'm wishing anything anyone. simply stated Florida may state look seeing consistently accused hiding manipulating data. seem think said Florida bad example, care states ""win"". live Ohio give fuck ""we best state"" measuring stick. want people safe alive. Pretty sure wedding.. pandemic.. groom COVID symptoms wins stupid department wanting wear mask. Great news. Well done, people Malaysia. understand examples personal experience mean lot know many people able whatever reason. families successful mean families could be. People different struggle different reasons. getting downvoted raising hand saying ""I know somebody"" kind argument group whole. NFL team owner cares safety employees Governors care residents. crazy buy rec anyway. easy get medical pays ounce. smoke less ounce year, get medical. Hah, okay. let ask something. 
Is USA better Sweden? 

Doesn’t work way talking exponentially growing fire-like epidemic. Go r/conspiracy sure rather brain lacking make change mind? looking information? misspelled ""people"". lying lying Yet thousands sign willingly deal every year. Funny free works. wife saved life too. holding life. two huge factors put Texas position:

* hit state relatively late. time “COVID hype” died people started thinking isn’t real thing, started spreading rapidly state.
* Texas Texas. It’s collective independent freedom fighters refuse follow *new* laws. 

People inherently hate change. got accustomed laws safety regulations already place (stop signs, seatbelts, etc) bark “FASCISM” new regulations needed. According former ADHS Director Humble, currently executive director Arizona Public Health Association, CSC plan ""essentially mechanism deciding gets care enough go around,"" told KTAR News 92.3 FM's The Mike Broomhead plan would see patients rated scoring system determine prioritized based severity condition. mean, America elected reality tv show host highest office land. Thats retarded u work urself anywhere u want. Lmao nobody says great irony Swedes desperately trying deny problem country racism, going far blaming on”Chinese trolls” lmao, nothing emphasis exactly big problem racism, homophobia anti-semitism really is. pandemic made us interested buying SOs student loans 0% October. we're using starting bonus closing costs emergency funds got sent away work I'll hitting overtime per diem furloughed laid people want come back new terms. I'm serial renter financial personal situation we're completely changed viewpoint buying. 

Stock low area prices still high. we'll find something equal rent little payment. I'm opposite. 3-ply masks provided employer fit well enough keep glasses fogging up. I've tried tricks. We're supposed wear masks wearing cloth masks one's said anything. hot hell, especially since AC worked well years, least see. society keep others putting everyone else danger.


We arrest drunk drivers. arrest idiots shoot guns air.


If want put others danger, stay away rest us. Go hermit island cave somewhere else.


If still insist putting others danger, rest us grow tired sitting jail drunk drivers fools shoot guns air. link work Trump handled amazingly, I'd think would favourable re-election. 👋 hey. I'm teacher unemployed people making right now. Literally best state almost every metric. don’t? Kinda. Remember episode Spongebob he's bus misses stop, drop cliff Rock Bottom? That's Springfield. actually articles showing linked states reopening people hanging indoors close quarters situations. contrast, protests outside open air. makes sense timeline spike hypothesis outside reduces risk spread. way: I've virus. parents died virus. well educated medical issues even though medical degree, could gotten nursing degree wanted it.

Your anecdotal experience make expert all. interact lot doctors lot fucking clueless comes Covid. 

Only time data going give us clear picture mess. said, reason downplay all. People need afraid need adjust lives duration reduce load hospital systems. Guilty Dear Americans, yes baddies. check /r/altcountry ... think find lot music right alley. makes hard? beautiful, thank you. Go it.  r/decreasingly Agreed! They’re young excited knows there’ll safer time coming years, think they’re going it. sure it’s outside I’m thinking they’re smart enough that. Though dinner another story. I've always dreamed could take New England New York country. Could imagine making laws beholden fucking Alabama? totally feel :( LOVE car, started really hatin' Musk. I've seen open cafes fastfoods around area, usually get half tables, position 2 meters apart there's 1 chair per standard size table. take mask sitting wear approaching counter.

Went cafe really heavy furniture pretty much stacked bunch books vases half chairs one would sit them. Oh stfu. Chicago things seem improving, although numbers frustratingly “holding steady,” deaths spread aren’t bad currently. Pritzker done amazing job handling virus state-wide. worry another flare-up inevitable though. It’s like state lines impenetrable forcefields. People travel get sick start again. I’m hoping scientific miracle one vaccine trials proves successful sooner later. Heightened thinking imo ability weigh information, run coarse, set back burner accepting . 

Being able veiw something objectively, balance way say actually impact things around . 

Delusional would watch certain tv news cycle even Alex Jones say , truth, take whatever feed you. saying that. think he's showing self interested is.

There's concrete proof boosting immune system would significant effect. mean good idea regardless boost immune system eat right know could beat immune system that's running x% capacity long genetics good.

I always feel like Joe thinks fans like him, work office jobs hates probably bit overweight eat right. What’s consensus around celebrating 4th? heard little related it. 

Is traveling state justifiable? going beach alright? meeting people multiple different states good idea one uses masks? 

I personally think still risky, easily avoidable. problem waiting see friends, fear think don’t want see given taking virus seriously. Conspiracy culture gone fucking nuts since picked main stream. People say Deep State they're talking way closer New World Order, nobody remembers FEMA death camps NWOs supposedly wanting cull undesirable parts global population, *really* weird main stream theorists inherently trust blatant disinformation agents.

I believe NWOs modern Deep State, really bizarre see old school weirdos right government corrupting public's view reality push agendas. believe Earth 2000 years old. 100%, zero sympathy mAsKs DoNt CaTcH ViRuS would require us be, united... protest spurring spread much ""reopening"" done narrative defend ""reopening"" cost, even human lives whole country issue.

After decades nurses doctors carry surplus patients hospital even operate 100% natural capacity length time.

Add sick staff, staff says fuck im getting sick idiots think it’s scam, lack traveling medical professionals you’re danger. Vermont updated yesterday unless things went south real fast make extra total. However death count rise good. 😢 worry, Italy said FACTUALLY virus ""medically non-existant"" ""weakened"" much virus ""no longer infectious."" Surely ""beat"" virus wrong. saw France24 there's big drama talks lockdown angry citizens. must confused. moron *expandable* high tisk individuals. good news! actually bought sewing machine learning see make face masks! soon... ...Panderin' favorable reelection, ignored. guiding principle administration. already explained link provide proof claim why. expand, main issue lies magnitude claim. engaged hyperbole cannot back up, one become overly hyperbolic.

If toned original claim one closer truth, would backed rhetorical corner. Higher 100% = let's start converting regular beds ICU beds let's assign nurse / doctor patients safely treat / monitor.

Also, gets worse, let's choose get ICU care all, despite desperately needing it.

Here Spain whole country suffered, extra-awful hotspot Madrid situation got nightmarish, fast.

I'm sorry nightmare US getting into. watch afar wish guys best. needs reported masses people see sinks in. interviews people COVID experiencing now, months later. her, lot teachers around US. get roast beef sandwich. remember going Kelly's wayyyyyy back day nana like ""why supposed like this?"" Stay safe Sweden. unfortunately lack national leadership many people took level disinterest COVID protection. karma going come play hope best sooner later co-worker going come spread COVID math fans Hopefully bride groom (making assumption there) find way live stream wedding everyone stay safe share special moment friends! So.....kill infected? cowardly business owners need take fucking stand. Start enforcing mandatory, exceptions. can't shop/patronize business without mask mouth covering kind. refuse leave, removed security police called. Fauci flip flopping every week, sub treats like god beyond me. oh yeah Brasil, India UK killing it... Drink home. Don’t bring Dunkin’ Donuts grocery store. ""pop"" country music good. now. 

Eric Church, Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, etc pretty good artists. sift bullshit there. Medications affect test result, swab look genetic material virus airway, nothing symptoms level mucus.  long, circle-jerking chain idiots. virus go rapid spread spread magically overnight 60%. Every immune person ""dead end"" - imagine maze 20% turns leads dead ends. Remindme! 15 days ""Reply thread""

They're going push date back. native Texan, say Spongebob right one. 

There's many dummies really making depressed. 

Not mention huge influx Californian immigrants, can't tell fellow Texans dumb, new wave dumbness.  lol. santa's coming early year! 

Seriously, though, know they'll find way manipulate this. ""hospitalized 3 days underlying conditions age 40"" somesuchshit.   Good them! deserve free 'Conspiracy mentality' hell obviously idea vaccines developed. ""since March"". really believe someone develop test successful vaccine less 4 months? Welcome harsh reality. middle exponential rise week worry -- next week. Texas set record [7000 new cases that's likely underreported. Earlier week, hospitals worried running beds. gilead 40 drugs pipeline 1 truly profitable drug patent runs next 5 years. rem becoming profitable critical gilead. 
 
Thier r&amp;d equal revenue 2019.

the ""marketing budget"" includes aids awareness prevention campaigns world. 

they programs give drugs patients dont insurance. programs low income people do. 

i think fundamentally dont understand pharmaceutical industry It’s party I’ll die want Good points. expect vaccine ready ""predicted"", I'm sure meant one many would better candidate. hopeful early next year populations start it. uneducated gut feeling says working vaccine wont ready late next year.

Our best defense staying healthy, get sun, take vitamin D, exercise, extend ourselves. pristine genes could now. “Other cities” bit stretch locations Galveston Woodlands. lot kids (and teens) rely school programs everything housing food 8+ hours day. daily breakfasts, public transport, extra-curricular activities, even safe housing. takes significant amount time, money, resources educate youth. parents literally time provide adequate home-schooling; resources provide daily breakfast/lunch and/or clothes; resources (internet/books/calculators, etc.) provide education; parents may mental physical capability providing education. incredibly hard many parents, especially trying ride economic tide pandemic, provide home-schooling next months. Additionally, schools refuge abuse; time meet friends time kids teenagers get away home grow develop own.

It takes village raise child.

I *do not* personally agree re-opening schools fall. think exponential spread virus school much greater risk downsides; address fundamental problem allowed manifest society:

We turned schools glorified day-cares instances, funneled many youth-care programs school system, system '*pause*' were, creates backlog future issues. lacking infrastructure provide adequate care children external school, economic freedom parents take burden upon themselves.

*If* schools open fall, society come together provide assistance less-able families across nation need help. Wether that's monetary relief funds, free book programs, online classes schools/universities, good neighbor bringing young mother next door pie every while. ...how else supposed drink. Im sure called asshole though, definitely happened. everyone clap after? Well current president US helped power Kremlin Russia, bolsanaro aspires like them.
It’s shocking run countries similar ways country music artist start dressing like Hollywood? studies this, said protests spread, people go protests stayed home avoided going out, cancelled effects protest-lead spread. full paper (PDF) interested 

And thousands people protesting actually many, put number perspective, 5.6 million people riding subway New York City every single day numbers took off. regularly search expat sites. Can't leave yet I'm always keeping eye options. Agreed, probably less drop bucket Tesla, I'm cancelling order. can't support treatment employees. America’s entire response pandemic like someone taking giant shit clogging toilet. Instead using plunger taking care problem, try flushing. Maybe water goes little. keep flushing toilet overflows there’s shit water everywhere. think need stop commenting articles... see what's funny, exactly? know people love use exaggerated terms describe responses something, hard time believing get much emotional response seeing gazillionth headline ""group X country accused murdering civilians group Z"". Lol. business, employees refuse return they're enjoying beautiful weather making enough unemployment stay happy.

We'll fight it, backed system is, take practically forever. wrong, people insist lying dangerous covid general population? antifa blm people camp front city hall harassing anyone gets close."
