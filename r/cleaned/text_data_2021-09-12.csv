I disagree decision, think that's data showing. remicade, may actually help her. studying remicade right see used patients severe covid-19. Also heard anyone remicade dying remicade got covid19. I'm situation living life permanent isolation, neither she.

Hey newborns, time vaccines approved 12s, would've old enough, anyway!

At least, that's feels like. Demographywise Sweden common Netherlands Belgium Norway. Denmark would Nordic country worth comparing to. Problematic link.    Cynically refused vaccinate part statistic vaccination rate eventually climb higher 80% (assuming kids vaccinated too)

I'm glad hear shot helped though! I've heard good bad things it. steroid works long term, like nerve block area?  Who's first   saying make sense, people getting infected vaccinated mean hospitalized. lol

Vaccines reduces 85-90% chance hospitalization, forgot?  consent procedure children trials? I‚Äôm genuinely quite curious presented decision made.

Now try guess who's fault. Covid Rapid tests free state. stunned go Outside learn states charging them. selfish one receive vaccine? 

People give shit ""effectiveness"" vaccine. 

At first prevent, reduce. First never able spread virus, still spread virus. 

Take hard look ""effective"" emergency vaccines are. effective 3rd shot? effective subsequent 4th &amp; 5th shot virus continues mutate harbors vaccined bodies. 

Additionally, above, misinformation given government &amp; political pushers, anything negative said vaccines get shunned get banned speaking it.

""Eyeing fourth dose"" bit dramatic. They're securing supplies case needed. that's unusual. EU already purchased 900M doses (more twice total population) top original orders (which already far needed double-dose everyone) months ago. order option 900M doses.

But see headlines saying EU eyeing seventh dose.

While funded government, bill still passes health insurance system, get see cost tests insurance statements cost pack 5 tests CHF 60 (~$65).

However, lately Switzerland decided stop funding free tests vaccinated people (weird choice, OK) soon they'll stop everyone. Antibodies targeting it. common molecule cell membranes general.

Since vaccinated tested eat restaurants testing quick free many didn‚Äôt get vaccinated.

The government pays around 25‚Ç¨ per test done pharmacy (AG Test/ Rapid Test)

In Vienna PCR Test free well, done via Video/WebApp city pays around 15‚Ç¨ per test.

Since vaccine cheaper (without logistics doctors priced in) starting problem majority got vaccinated bet good glas whiskey same. Hardly. People get vaccinated large enough numbers blunt ton. people either get vaccinated, survive infection, both. long run becomes circulating virus unlike myriad influenzas deal annually. lost dogs months lockdown hate it. would loved working home.

It‚Äôs weird. heard standards medical devices rigorous. granted, based watching documentary titled bleeding edge Wow that‚Äôs tough Viet. I‚Äôll reading scene there. kid Pfizer trial....10micrograms per dose. I'm vaccinated Moderna 100 time. kid weighs 10lbs less me.... yes, kid.....but I'm going lie, feel little concerned (not regards death, regarding infection comes that) I'd like kid vaccine dose that's *least* half mine rather 10th.....we basically wear size clothes *shrugs shoulders throws hands up* 
Idk maybe think means something perhaps doesn't.....


I'm thankful got trial. thankful. I'm meaning complaint. Rather, I'm highlighting factual difference, also given new research Moderna protecting much better infection...... even larger discrepancy dosage kids small....


......I'm wondering that, means next year, long run...... discussing back 2020 possible ""bradykinin"" storm; much ACE2 knocked due virus (or case guess also antibodies afterwards targeting ACE2), bradykinin regulation gets whack.  1% blood clot. UK, 1 92000 astrazeneca recipients blood clot, like say, could even less country. [See doctor ASAP get symptoms described e.g. really rare enough worrying useless. great majority unvaccinated folks get infected end hospital. Many never show symptoms continue believing hoax. get sick recover say ""see, told ya, like flu"".

They ignore cross 1M mark dead Americans, still believing stats inflated fake.

People listen experts surprised news. ignore it. Yes 5x 10x (11x death) due smaller chance catching first place. guy replied responding someone vaccinated got Covid anyway, take 5x away left 2x reduction (2.2x death). get infected, vaccines dramatically reduce symptoms likelihood hospitalized. end hospitalized, vaccines dramatically reduce likelihood dying.


Do consider 2x reduction hospitalization dramatic? 0.2x hospitalization death, dramatic too? fact getting downvoted saying truth ridiculous. Get another test and/ speak doctor concerned.   you‚Äôve proven point or?

It's possible infected once, quite literally direct analogy recent forest fire - going see area burn twice season.  mean, health care systems strained even areas high vaccination rates.

It's cruel needlessly destructive force health systems cancel non-emergency surgeries ration care, happening many places effects wide-range people including COVID.

Multiple people died live waiting heart surgeries one dude went cardiac arrest front everyone ER he'd waiting 3 hours treatment.

As long risk health care exists, much cruel allow contagious disease spread without kind community level mitigation Neither you. like y(t) = e^(-kt^2). asking spouse heck churches holding vaccine drives. Surely some, somewhere, right? hope whoever ends caring raising eventually explains parents died, personal choices led result, ans hopefully children learn mistakes.

Yes, possible Covid also possible got sick false positive PCR test. Antigen tests pretty solid symptomatic.

Yep! really tough choice make moment doctors advised always change research! mix vaccine immunity natural immunity covid simply stops risk vast majority people, potentially even reach herd immunity Way many nurses anti vax, it‚Äôs shocking. Yes.  probably dumb still serious question: people think coronavirus big deal, even though hospitals overcrowding COVID patients, even first world countries? agree you, fuckheads don‚Äôt happen (at scale). antivaxxer product billions spent libertarian lobbying propaganda underfund education erode faith government. problem still children aren‚Äôt vaccinated. kids shot much less worried. wasn‚Äôt worried DELTA. 3 months seems like 90 day wait period supposed havr getting covid getting vaxxed Same. mask mandate still live, wear mask indoors. completely agree zero point putting life pause vaccinated.  get vaccinated? college students entire community. fac/staff go home unvaccinated children vulnerable family members. Actually society cracking people knowingly giving sexually transmitted diseases. seen grevious bodily harm 5 year prison sentence. That's virus slow cause harm, immediate preventative interventions, good life expectancy also spread unless unprotected sex.

Maybe also remove restrictions drink driving? still think we'd many daily deaths covid NHS overrun. 

Anyway we'll see pans out. Boardwasters saw around 5000 cases outdoor event national death spike area follow. harm others accepted healthy brush Covid (or think can).

The civil liberties vulnerable go events non existent continue hide away normal life. Absolutely. outdoor crowd stadium could even reducing cases.

This could easily case last season well (for outdoor sports). Though sports bars packed then, people surely house parties replace them. That‚Äôs close enough me. Honestly got son done May, birthday January 2010. He‚Äôs also small kid zero concerns this. Hospitals close overwhelmed Israel.

the unvaccinated get sick die, also vaccinated get hospitalized die, much lower risk.

It seems live indefinely.  sad! happen? It‚Äôs horrible That's tough call they're 6 months past third dose, 50, booster shot much cheaper answer changing life around COVID. is, risk (of catching COVID kids) higher kids risk catching them. 2 November? Wow. Got source. I‚Äôm sorry feel way. agree everybody vaccinated States huge shortage medical professionals including low paid folks clean rooms prepare foods. 

We already seeing hospitals unable function mass exodus staff nurses contract positions, I‚Äôm even sure require vaccinated - Travel nurses let know. 

My hope folks get vaccinated. wife‚Äôs OB January February gave medical journal published reviewed ACOG said recommending pregnant women least second trimester get shot. used data based mRNA vaxxes. wife got March 7 months pregnant. literally already get vaccines last trimester pregnant improve antibody transfer baby. covid vaccine different Oh definitely are.

DM'ed op direct CDC link study, explaining post inaccurate. acting like knob hamming automod action really is.

If curious CDC study 2 days ago talks reduction hospitalization/deaths vaccinated dramatic OP thinks necessarily. virus mutates uses host cells replicate itself. host multiple viruses time virus ‚Äúmiss packages‚Äù something slightly different. Covid virus use humans whole host mammals mutate itself. know sure Mink, Cats several others pass back humans.

Some virus mutations might less dangerous less contagious. Others might way contagious dangerous. problem is, less dangerous ones won‚Äôt keep going. it‚Äôs easy catch them, won‚Äôt keep traveling people.

That‚Äôs we‚Äôre seeing right now. look variants dozens known. ones make contagious ones people catch pass on. dangerous one repackaged even dangerous one, etc. That‚Äôs wave worse one before. contagious strains keep spreading larger percentages population. (mostly) outdoors though. kind thing could (mostly) done safely entire pandemic. Definitely safer watching sports bar. Unfortunately USA healthcare insurances run like car insurance. cost system, expensive insure premiums go up. plus factor insurances charge nothing preventative care. lot areas US unfortunately let healthcare take slide priority tax funded projects. We're seeing fallout now. Even though state relatively okay cases/deaths, hospitals full people transferring overflow hospitals states. Mensos. Puros mensos. Su herencia sus hijos es nada m√°s que dolor tristeza.   Y‚Äôall super salty countries managed keep things open without mass death infection eh? say. recent it'll pretty rough time sore throat all. tonsils pretty important immune function much bacteria anything else. honestly guess, probably make difference. odds happening 40 year old couple pretty insane, first time I've heard couple dying, makes think theres something catch covid increase fatality rate , like get infected covid carrier right time peak load , much worse maybe something variant 2 caught .

She got booster today hope it‚Äôs enough clearly isolating, strong hygiene sanitation protocols, grocery delivery, etc. doesn‚Äôt always cut it. 

She just...doesn‚Äôt go places things anymore (besides doctor occasionally visiting vaccinated sister). That‚Äôs interesting. heard early 2022 5 Scott gotlieb others. Never heard broken farther. 2 year old would happy learn approval new year. us fully vaxxed, parents getting boosters, kid getting vaxx, I‚Äôm done shit. It‚Äôs part life risks low they‚Äôll be. political spiritual point people get infuriates covid isnt going away. It'll endemic, chances eradicating within next decade slim. Long covid bad, people thinking covid going like 2025. People still catching it, catch moderate case many times lung fibrosis causes life long disabilities. people already life long disabilities it. Death smallest majority, survivors majority, nearly 80% sample recent study sort symptoms past 6 months, anywhere headaches still shortness breath. Doubt that, props india getting control atleast. Vaccination rates also tremendous well done India  went mass vaccination site drive thru, probably one day approved 12 &amp; up. already know answer that. never said constitutional right air travel. said personally idea vaccine requirements air travel. Yeah got stampede worth right? /S  constitutional right air travel. mean.. still valid. ...and agree that. Unfortunately truth go on. got second shot 4 days ago. time iv got sore arm tired bit drowsy feeling.  posted update some, may add depending whether people ask it. never expected actually create bibliography stuff reading, since initially good, stuff read back March long buried thousands new articles. Still quite good hospitalisation / death, great infection  Huh funny. legalise abortion then? friend mine (british) lives works city China, keeps abreast happening lives (I know China big place) there‚Äôs nothing going there, far tell. They‚Äôre entire system top bottom designed fail majority people. Trump's style discourse divisive. Hence lack middle ground. people like say always way I'm barely old enough say hasn't. according mass antibody research carried China National Health Commitee early 2021 (or late 2020), thousands samples taken 3 groups (Wuhan, Hubei Province outside Wuhan, provinces outside Hubei), suggests 6x ppl may got infected Covid19 Wuhan comparing reported official number , quite consistent official number cases parts China. It''s common pandemic since I've saw similar/worse antibody research lots countries/regions.

Saying vector vaccines spike mRNA wrong. carry instructions delivery method that's different already said previous comment I'm repeating now. instructions make produce spike either spike ""don't"" it. vaccine delivers finished cultivated spike Novavax one production hell half year now.  True, vaccines free. sure getting voted. main problem America. divided certain % population blindly obeying political leaders tell them.

Just like D's called Trump racist banning travel certain countries. Yet praise Biden it. truly believe anything. oppose whatever party doing. lot American follows along. booked 15 yr old today, Homebush max vax place. First vax two weeks, second jab 3 weeks that.

Alot better thought would be. possible Republic democracy time. democracy. well functioning one. precise rated flawed democracy world democracy index: Thank you! official source somewhere specifically details points brought up? post great summary, I'd rather link people official documentation possible concern come conversation. missing kids dying, covid cause disability, still know long term effects. Ever heard shingles, long term effects chicken pox? see childhood survivors polio walking around? Nope, got limps died 20-30 years less life expectancy. 

The final part important though. need less people ICU, hospitals overrun many places. 

The last one need parent, read articles parents watching kids ventilator. 

1 percent million 10,000. hundreds millions people children. read articles children's hospitals filled.  Driving's preference, well. Unfortunately, everyone always luxury time. recently take two round-trip flights due family deaths. Death duties types occasions cannot skip.

Both deaths due Covid, gatherings small. got lucky time, nobody getting sick - - even though took precautions, still due luck skill.

We, vaccinated, need deserve reasonable access variety relatively safe travel modes. vaccine requirement would go long way toward that, along reasonable accommodations young vaccination. confirms everything? Lol yeah compiled like 20 important ones. get work see find citations, gained info course year, taking notes along way, easy spill without links lol

We're fine, we're putting energy collectively hating couple broke lockdown travel across country holiday home. abused essential service exemption get Auckland airport hour south travel south island. 

But that, strategy working we'll seeing restrictions ease soon. back normality end year. think narziss pointing technically incorrect say mRNA vaccines ""have spike protein"". say result presence spike protein.

It would accurate say current vaccines either spike protein cause produced.  heard there‚Äôs lot rough stuff AU recent data legislation, too. feel bit guilty, car ok-ish, pandemic let go feelings drove nowhere. Every day.

Now always read arguments like: 

* Usually, long term side effects imply long term exposure. E.g. need take medication 10 years medication takes toll organ die medication fucked organ. whatever.
* know vaccines good. never vaccine long term issue. issues showed 3 weeks max. way past that.

Now seem make sense, people usually counter first one with: know that's case absolutely new technology like mRNA vaccines? says get issue 2, 5 20 years now?

and second one with: previous vaccines based different technologies, e.g. protein based ""dead virus"" based. mRNA based.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot people wait protein based vaccines (e.g. novavax) then, two points become valid again.

Indeed. not. connection healthcare reasons nurses inclined doctors say, worked close some. (Former nurse, pro vaccination vaccinated) I'm saying think got problematic attitudes doctors making nurses 

I'm sure follow: saying average work relationship nurses doctors bad nurses simply mistrust doctors' judgement health related issues?

That, itself, would far scarier vaccination hesitance.... Cvs, Walgreens, amazon surcharge added insurance costs company. vaccinated? Pay extra $200. way convince people fence. Don‚Äôt pay get vaccine, pay *not* get vaccine. think governmenta considering trying stay zero community transmission indefinitely.

But makes sense me, already zero community transmission, try keep way get vaccination numbers much can. live Western Australia community transmission economy mental health great result. might think locking entire state couple cases crazy stamp hard fast lock down, seems best outcomes metrics.

As opposed Sydney tried walk line seeing far could go without locking result dealing much turmoil restriction freedoms. Much appreciated. Yup

Just think regular ""free"" tests really probably costing us 10x pay tax money. real accountability there, especially pandemic. significantly immunocompromised individuals vaccinated group models 1 2. would screw data wildly.  doubt article make past peer review. 

Hopefully someone else use dataset compare natural vs vaccine immunity. think proving worked consistent across board maybe dosage potential side effects could vary children vs adults.

That‚Äôs body‚Äôs immune system complex, said, defenses besides antibodies may protect someone getting seriously sick.


I guess question really becomes: want use booster shots limit effectiveness mild disease not?

I assume effectiveness mild disease, mean actually catching covid.

The main point vaccines protect severe/death - ended bonus protected catching covid too. vaccines protect catching covid - opinion boosting people keep protection going. Even country 20-25% people dont seem give fuck protecting anyone. Lets get maximum protection give damn. Nothing stopped NZ Australia procuring vaccines. 

NZ least plenty vaccines now. matter getting jabs arms fast people queue up. already gone peak daily rates US, UK Canada. total 76% eligible population made vaccine appointments, 66% first jab now. Auckland outbreak numbers even higher, close 3% population getting jab day last week. 

The hope NZ hold opening border kids jabbed, would give us much higher vaccination rates Singapore right now. also possibility boosters Q1 2022 provide better protection, Israel experimenting now. NZ Novavax already lined boosters early 2022. 

There doubt big wave Covid border relaxes even little. question long hold off. Delta breaching MIQ every month, probably give elimination end year. high vaccination lets us handle outbreaks short local lockdowns, expect keep borders closed maintain elimination well 2022, perhaps year. total yes, necessarily per post, especially consider people post lot also create costs mean kids kindergardens primary schools entirely own, grownups present? enough drastically reduce efficacy vaccines? sort threshold needs crossed happen?

Unfortunately articles like leave details out, see it.

I still hope government's decisions scrutinized compared New Zealand gold standard over. Huh? makes 1 - Aug 29 - Delta Variant

Of half million sequenced genotyped Delta cases sampled... 1091 fully vaccinated deaths, 536 unvaccinated. So, mostly vaccinated deaths.

That seems wee bit higher 1%, exactly expect imbalance 90-99% vaccinated elderly time, almost young people vaccinated. 

This bad selective data article, hideously outdated. two Moderna shots didn‚Äôt feel thing. times scheduled shot Friday reaction wouldn‚Äôt miss work. times felt fine data pretty accurate due massive study ONS organisations. 

In UK largely back normal, especially England pretty much need masks anywhere anymore, except possibly public transport. 

Deaths following rise cases. Fully vaccinated deaths still extremely low, something lie 1% covid deaths fully vaccinated people.

This lack actions going drive massive wave, like doctors predicting. read details, red (worse) line spiking happens 100% vaccinated people stop wearing masks. current projection assumes everyone keeps using masks much currently, even they're vaccinated. Bronx (or NYC) since pandemic started, assuming Bronx functions similarly low income, majority-minority areas city, mask wearing never much thing there. 
 
After all, taking COVID seriously, gotten vaccinated? Yeah people point India earth people trusting data quality? worry less vaccinated. likely wont get severe illness. still could catch mild symptoms totally asymptomatic, then, smaller tiemframe unvaccinated, still infect others. probably dont want. So, stop spread one still mask up. poor vaccination rates upcoming (or already existing) wave kept place vaccines alone.

I'm curious anyone's employer said anything Biden's mandate. company 100 employees also business w/the feds doubly applies us. far company completely silent bit odd. know number anti-vaxxers team partly wonder they're trying avoid outrage.  Thanks advice! guess I'm worried infecting others family myself, even though everyone also fully vaccinated. makes sense Australia case count low. (and pretty much since around mid 2020) living covid-free. locally transmitted delta case last week. student school, entire school families went 14 days stay home quarantine listed exposure sites anyone also goes quarantine. 1,000 people quarantined home. Everyone else keep living normally. It‚Äôs worked far - last time case count one case got 150 pretty much home quarantine tested positive weren‚Äôt infectious community. (We total 7 covid deaths state 5 million since pandemic started).

I think covid get outs control contact tracing becomes difficult. people ‚Äî STOP BUYING MASKS!‚Äù surgeon general, Jerome M. Adams, said tweet Saturday morning. ‚ÄúThey effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus, health care providers can‚Äôt get care sick patients, puts communities risk!‚Äù""

This exactly talking about. Letting hysteric population without adequate knowledge deplete mask stocks gouged prices healthcare workers cannot access definitely detrimental public evidence wearing masks healthy people protect them,‚Äù

This definitely correct time, statement something indicates incompetence. basic principles evidence based medicine dictate nothing administered without conclusive evidence works specific setting context use, absence highly probable large net benefit, definitely case early wear incorrectly, increase risk infection they‚Äôre touching face often.‚Äù

This still true, however large body evidence conclusively indicate *public usage masks* beneficial regardless this.

All quotes posted prove known (obvious) protection masks COVID. know public usage beneficial public health standpoint.  many wastewater treatment plants equipped collecting preserving specimens regular basis? UK slope somewhat troubling, considering vaccination rate.

I trust data countries, certainly US. Oh Jesus laughed hard know have. Take shocked pleased slightly ashamed upvote think everyone mask help quash pandemic, vaccinated people worry overly much themselves. flu appears quite bit dangerous Covid fully vaccinated people. hope mind asking wife okay? not. choose get vaccinated, believe imposing choice others. make zero sense? 


I smoke cigarettes either, also care people do. Cannot fix stupid. fire stupid‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúNothing see hear. Move along‚Äù‚Ä¶ wish negative things him.... I'd recommend N95s etc surgical. surgical better primitive fabrics, thats german health comittee recommends. would buy N95s, go around dollar. Specially crowded areas indoors id wear them. Pfizer protects well severe illness. Often hear numbers around 90% depending severity infection look at. probably wouldnt care much get mild infection. said health experts advice vaccinated challenge infection anyways. endemic character covid, fact never go away, lead everyone coming contact virus sooner later. vaccination significantly reduce risk far understand statements experts. required law, school nurses, administrators school staff continue address positive, presumptive confirmed cases COVID-19. students staff positive COVID-19 test symptoms, return school work immediately.

I‚Äôm confused means. 

Does mean, example, possibility exposure negative test person return school? 

Or mean regardless exposure, test quarantine necessary? Good question wish understood enough answer. Maybe someone know chime in. really. allows numbers go normalcy return. 
Next step reduce testing start accept covid friend /s One fatal flaw, they're actually anti-social almost assuredly spreading it. I'm fully vaccinated still worried delta variant wear mask? There's mask mandate live even I'm quite worried would wear one anyway fear irrational? I'm fully vaccinated worry less? I'll admit since I've fully vaccinated I've changed behavior terms social distancing masks. That‚Äôs really conflicting statement makes zero sense.  believe read paper linked. there's separation needed, Lancet peer reviewed journals reject papers submitted CDC prevent dissemination politically motivated propaganda. interesting PCR testing usually free, rapid antigen testing latter done home much less labor involved. It‚Äôs hilarious terrified everyone left DeSantis know would absolutely demolish Harris 2024. bad stuck ;) live Australia people know able get long waiting lists. 1st world nation imagine bad 3rd world never either would trust experience someone has. feel misleading. Hospital staff go around putting everyone bed. need there, go home, whether patient wants go home not. know it‚Äôs healthy neither junk food eat. 

Part motivation try understand though it‚Äôs bad. They‚Äôre using Moderna now. ...You're talking papers, think he's easy target visible was, especially early on. easy latch narrative Fauci covid authoritarian. ... strange thing take offense to.

Science folks, understanding right? Ah, thank clarifying. makes perfect sense. link lot valid data although it‚Äôs labeled financial projection sorts; should‚Äôve asked clarify instead presuming worst. Sorry that. can't states vaccinated ones unvaccinated. even government president money. California New York providing school lunches kids Texas, Florida, Mississippi. get point. NJ NY, 62.7% fully vaccinated.

No one get 85% vaccine approved kids. much population 12 years old. DeSantis' 'Dr. Birx moment.  sat next Trump's podium offered clarification claim cleaners light could injected body. DeSantis look looked speaker, looked look concern puzzlement, looked speaker like wanted say something...but didn't. Behind official state seal podium, let statement stand.  citizens advised, apparently, non-scientist citizens random, guess?  embarrassing. people need protect themselves. nothing else say.

Hospitals fine everywhere except publicized locations. Get it. horrible thing pretend is.

You spreading false information. data completely based edge cases extreme possibilities. Please review CDC information: either troll overly fearful. Either way, done responding block now. cancer often comes back years later. covid dont that

Uhhh... definitely catch covid once. Don‚Äôt listen him, even delta way ALWAYS getting people vaccinated getting vaccine gradually gaining immunity virus manageable endemic like flu. you‚Äôre vaccinated whatever want. don‚Äôt know anybody still social distancing bubble bullshit. That‚Äôs long, long, long gone. given link data tracker shows timeline comparing covid 25 diseases life threatening conditions. me, showed insidious lethal covid really is.

I though, hate it. clinical study, what's going real world. Moderna applying get booster shot approved. third shots going arms right immunocompromised people first. CDC failing America refusing act updated data swiftly. 

FDA too. waiting Friday meeting discuss boosters? additional data planned come then. reminds 2008 financial system imploding day first Federal Reserve like ""our next regularly scheduled meeting 3 weeks, we'll look then"". Eventually realized needed start acting day day basis emergency waiting meetings calendared months ago made zero sense. slow rollout vaccines developing world results another variant, like hoarding syringes India gave us Delta, giving boosters US UK could actually end costing American/British lives. That's rub is. [ prepared offer booster shots Americans beginning week September 20 starting 8 months individual‚Äôs second meeting scheduled 17th announcement 20th? get scrapped? called made typo. supposed yo decimal point 1 3  words, end Covid-19 pandemic. fever increased intensity dose. got third shot first day available, kept bed 16 hours straight, fun. couple weeks since, though course worth it. Im pretty sure manipulating data including waiting report death death certificate printed rather time death. Sounds like Bush 9/11. OK, see. said, 0.01% seems miraculously low, maybe due lack completeness data. think 0.5-1% population might sick peak southern states. Maybe 1/10 states extremely well. 3% seems like could high side random clusters cases towns, even schools. Similar thing happened aunt. chemo, fell broke hip, continue treatment often needed surgery hip. Cancer spread like wildfire treatment frequency spread passed away month ago now.

Anyways, got first dose March, tested positive COVID three days later, got better got second dose time April. I'm person know got COVID doses.


My psoriasis got really really bad months back, went back injections. advised get third booster 3 weeks ago.


So.... 3 vaccine doses COVID within past 6 months. suppressed immune system studies coming together effectiveness vaccine immunosuppressants. I'm worried getting (or dying guess), sick last time (103-104 fever) despite functioning immune system time.


Just much uncertainty. understandable, hoping little clarity.  RemindMe! 5 hours certainly got back March.

""When get COVID-19 vaccine booster?
Not immediately. goal people start receiving COVID-19 booster shot beginning fall, individuals eligible starting 8 months received second dose mRNA vaccine (either Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna). subject authorization U.S. Food Drug Administration recommendation CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee Immunization Practices (ACIP).

 * FDA pull together coherent justification authorize boosters subset population

 * CDC ACIP schedule snap meeting discuss recommending them.

In study linked described condition spike protein. Even serological tests. identified non infectious route vitro supported vivo studies

They also used Sera show protein present seroconverted blood, used pericytes individuals though would different 5-10 days post infection, already infected ACE2 entry pathway. point mechanism pericyte damage caused release interleukins cytokines, vivo disease model would free floating Sera would already causing apoptosis heart, especially pericytes infected ACE2.

They also normalized spike concentration data age, instead would better used weighted normalization based national median age infection, median age cardiac failure due covid inflammation.

The thing, one variable admit discussion section inability properly distinguish Spike without structures sero samples. would ~JUST~ spike vivo. vitro study suggest proposal binding occur recombinant cells though using homemade spike, support citation likely using S1 subunit would closed conformation. definitely good new information. 

So pointed faults initial understanding, lot read still supports stuff I've read. Since study super super limited scope, implication pericyte inflammation specifically mediated cd147 entry points bit misleading lack variables accounted for, supported specific scope. 

This less Clear implications covid infection, implications outside coivd infection lasting heart inflammation virus cleared, given soluble protein concentrations lower replicating virus would present likely cause inflammation cases.

It works like, see breach law, make case. case gets scheduled there's time it. 

I really understand? countries always laws get broken constantly every day lot people - like speed limits trafic. 

Why suddenly impossible make laws more? think argument, could also claim impossible make laws speed limits ""because we'd need millions judges monitor every single car."" obviously possible, right?

A law saying false things would work like speed limits work countries guess. lot people would get away breaking it, habitual breaker would get fine while.

It also depends law made. Maybe say ""you're allowed say false things claim mainstream scientific view."" would allowed say ""I scientific basis think that..."" Probably could never illegal.

It‚Äôs hard get infuriated them, like lose respect people fast shit. nice! thanks! criminalization HIV mistake society, least recent years, increasingly recognizing that. 

Anyways, don‚Äôt mistake concerns anti vax. vaccinated, think everyone else do. board ‚Äúany policy name public safety‚Äù increasingly appears route going. social end pandemic's hit us weeks ago. authors medical doctors paper covers analysis studies study.

1. vaccinated
2. practice similar risk mitigation family - wearing high quality masks public indoor spaces, dining inside restaurants, attending crowded indoor events.

I think saying us spike protein blood that's lot like spikes COVID. mean we've gotten recently, mean, like probably hundreds years humans protein blood. happens doppleganger COVID's spike. get mistaken twins time run grocery store.

We also anti-spike protein blood causes swelling.

Before COVID, body balance, non-COVID friendly spike proteins would interact friendly anti-spike proteins throughout body change something else make area swell. would suppress anti-spike proteins everywhere swelling.

When catch COVID, immune system identifies anyone wearing spikes ""bad person"" orders executed. people, one two things happening: 1) immune system executes ton friendly spikes, too, 2) blood getting enough new friendly spike replacements COVID control. throws balance allows friendly anti-spikes go bananas, least areas. causes lots swelling, think triggers another immune system response. appears mechanism causing long-term COVID.

The article doesnt say this, people defeat COVID fairly easily must something different. maybe protecting friendly spikes, replenishing well keep blood balance, immune system undergoes shift post-infection stop attacking friendly spikes. maybe something else complicated. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

There's ""% eligible people vaccination shot"" there's ""total number people vaccination shot"". worth tracking, case, there's 13ish million Californians either can't get vaccination (kids almost entirely) chosen vaccinated. purposes times looked at. 

The total population Mississippi 3ish million. percentages different, that's less relevant number someone San Francisco picks Mississippi location set problems unmasked, unvaccinated people create. There's lot California maybe SFO area (almost 8 million population).

To use horror movie metaphor: calls coming everywhere, especially inside home someone living California. describing trend, unalienable fact. still correlated even exceptions exist. immune-compromised 3rd dose Moderna accordance w/ doctor's recommendation.  

I provide doctor's note pharmacy administering dose, experience checking.  Could city/state?

I mixed feelings receiving 3rd dose countries begging 1st. However, one ""high risk"" people efficacy rate would ""normal"" person.  

AND given spread Delta along unvaccinated running around like Typhoid Marys/Harrys, feel better little protection.   someone situation, would think flu also life threatening item. Hopefully, years, reduce seasonal thing she'll able operate flu. think get boosters case help all. FWIW, exposed Covid house twice antibodies. I'm sure tests perfect. I've searched searched can't find first two articles saw in. find NYPost article lays similar timeline: Pfizer submitting data 2-4 year olds FDA early October. tried link it, comment automatically removed due source.

The 6 months-2 years approval usually estimated late 2021/early 2022. 

 I've seen several articles lump two youngest cohorts together say approval 6 months expected next year. think timelines accurate ones break 6m-2 2-4 groups apart.  crime knowingly give someone HIV. nature rights viruses depends transmitted harder prove source.

 right people knowingly Covid spread around largely without consequence. think focus rights people mass scale rather protect potentially vulnerable victims get virus. many vulnerable people still dying virus despite vaccinated, whereas HIV death sentence anymore.

Smoking banned inside venues protect public health. Covid million times harmful spreads rapidly clubbers people watching EUROs go home give families. Second hand smoke doesnt keep replicating spreading.

We flew, vaccinated work home. never took test since planned quarantine anyway 2 weeks home wondered it.   Yep, feel pain commend what's right you, also what's right community (and seriously...the country &amp; human race). know sounds extremely dramatic that's taking precautions... care vulnerable/immunocompromised, open economy including supply lines still struggling (based grocery store visit today), cut odds another variant pop fucks us even Delta. thank doing. ok, let know goes! Since state. greatly excited this. hate wait pediatricians office sick kids running around flu shot. No, many not, quackers, sure. Nope, CDC doesn‚Äôt want cause panic. There‚Äôs reason get vaccinated flu; kills 30k year. They‚Äôre part way out. won‚Äôt get us herd immunity vaccines, ough helps Many medical establishment administering ivermectin fight covid. loss Oh makes sense. dunno, says ‚Äúnationwide‚Äù, we‚Äôll see. 

The appointment next Friday. peds office doesn‚Äôt vaccines yet long weekend coming (Preschool closed following Monday). thought might fever something extra day get would good. Plus, playing Preschool, fever 24 hours, don‚Äôt want keep home fever flu shot end get COVID test protocol. Hopefully they'll start losing jobs. surprised. Florida. Recently found sister antivax. Says baby can't get vaccine can't. works daycare. None siblings vaccinated either. Even worse live home (early 60s parents).

Thankfully parents onboard vaccines vaccinated now. Hehehe girl joking earlier horse wormer people. actually friend offer find us some. Needless say laughed phone. May bea friend now. Oh well.  necessarily year. probably next 5 years. think better classification mild would ""If seek medical help"". sure that's classification use. false positive PCR common? know false negatives positive? Thanks.  wonder many would hospital cases overwhelmed system. Seems like putting billboards saying many people who've answered surveys ""I'm never getting vaccinated"" going die. able make decent estimate, right? every city filled billboards saying, ""We know 17,142 people going die Atlanta covid. Almost could prevent two simple injections. #covidroulette"" would surely see improvement, right? first vaccine booster get? essentially whole dose? Personally think Biden decided 8mo said 6mo would millions people ‚Äúpast due‚Äù already isn‚Äôt enough vaccine supply staff handle it. leadership mismanaged since nearly two years I‚Äôve yet see anything makes think still won‚Äôt fumbling along next year two. best vaccinating. Grab pulse oximeter safe. swift uneventful recovery. Also, avoid horse paste. Sounds right. conservative see things make angry. fully vaccinated. totally fine losing jobs, places losing employees, get vaccine. ones bitching months tell people go back work. Hey, f--- heads! vaxxed working!  98% asymptomatic mild (not asymptomatic)

as long didn‚Äôt end hospitalized, it‚Äôs deemed mild. Even you‚Äôre bed ridden 3 weeks. wonder fall compared nations rank similarly regards education healthcare affordability? We're way behind considering wealth, making unattainable significant percentage population, IDK we're surprised would start look for/trust alternative learning sources &amp; remedies. wife got second shot close month ago trying conceive. Even though excuse, almost every single person life vehemently getting Vax. Almost every time go work coworkers boss would talking every person getting vaccine getting sick, stories people knew left paralyzed getting it. wife's parents Nurses, telling us constantly get Vax trying kids. finally decided secret, guess I'm trying say see people get caught everything everyone around saying, instead making best decision yourself. Fuck, yeah. different state state. Seems like they're trying figure going effective start boosters I'd imagine. Oh completely agree. would never baby outside medical facility myself. also huge problem doctors jumping c section woman much sneezes labor use medication advance labor along hospitals schedule instead otherwise healthy, normal timeline  know country literally everything wants kill them. It‚Äôs nice know Australians ain‚Äôt fucking around virus getting vaccinated. think means don‚Äôt enough people anymore You‚Äôre wrong, especially it‚Äôs marketed mRNA. Honestly I'm really sure they're waiting for, here! They're supposed debate sometime week Pfizer booster. agree completely. going come contact Delta point, goal vaccinated first. Awe!! sad. ANYWAYS....... misinformation turned away. Especially infertility claim (which BS).  Seriously. I‚Äôm saying masks don‚Äôt effect, act like they‚Äôre even remotely effective vaccines absurd yet people actually think that. Yep. cousin nurse would get shot pregnancy. think husband, wouldn‚Äôt let take anti-anxiety depressions meds either‚Ä¶ still won‚Äôt breastfeeding.

Three include fact opinion articles aren‚Äôt allowed. Four consider changed title and/or underlying ‚Äúarticle‚Äù clickbait. 

You‚Äôre roll OP. comparing makes absolutely sense 
 
Quite opposite, comparing Sweden primarily Nordic countries makes sense. 
 compare Czechia Slovakia, Hungary, Poland? 
 
There similar countries Balkans + Austria Germany. 
Sweden Nordic countries different countries. I've thinking more. think right. Yeah I'm definitely keeping eye that. got final Pfizer shot near end March. I'm hoping figure something concrete sometime soon. Man, fence this. see sides. would nice milestones hit could start backing mask wearing, however, think would quickly turn hard dates masking would stop. still need able flexibility add mask mandates necessary. 
 
Overall, messaging great consistent. mask mandates wouldn‚Äôt become politicized first place, would much easier. much important get doses people around world access give people boosters  biggest issue vaccine uptake. everybody vaccinated, Delta would blip radar, anti-vaxxers hospital vaccinated people either infected nearly sick, need people take fucking shot hospitals overwhelmed.  NOOOOO people still want doom severe breakthrough cases say need wear masks social distance forever, even possibly lock again. course - here, happy *some* protection hoping boosters come soon. Good luck! like healthcare system compared rest civilized world. Wow, that's awful. can't imagine ""hope best call run problems"" comes labor &amp; delivery. woke first day finals week freshman year. take physics final hallucinating DayQuil. great resource, thanks posting ‚Äúfact check‚Äù something isn‚Äôt consensus though? year ago lab leak theory considered misinformation, government saying it‚Äôs possible theory. decides factual not, especially truth isn‚Äôt known? That‚Äôs issue idea. Every single person planet bias toward viewpoint one way another.  feel like they're going shots pediatrician offices records kids. That's best way imo.

My kid turns 5 November. made appt 5 yr well check I'm praying get first shot (she's waiting looooong time) Guess might die then. Covid care afternoon/evening, parents get close contact exposure letter written legalese cannot understand.
 following day, anywhere quarter half class COVID scare. continue several days get test. test positive, go back Step One.

At kid‚Äôs school Alabama parents literally told nothing another student class tests positive. Alabama Department Public Health made contact tracing optional leaves school itself. aren‚Äôt even bothering.

I ask kid every day pickup rundown absent, etc. that‚Äôs way get info all. anything Singapore still ""zero covid"" camp indefinitely, people pissed government roadmap easing restrictions Amen currently that? Cuz new deaths number crashing right shouldn't. end day really matter much, would arguing underreporting tens thousands cases US numbers would underreporting tens millions cases due scale outbreaks. experience first 2 rounds vaccines (wife/me, later almost 12 yo)... folks giving vaccines paying much attention bureaucratic rules. arm, shot.

The nurse giving wife shot basically begged get one, ahead technical place line, throwing away unused doses every week.

As soon proven safe kids, we'll find shot somewhere 10yo curious much jump vax numbers could attributed people getting 3rd doses (either legitimately falsifying information). I'm rural NC think bingo Yeah, person spreads facilitate. 

In cases anyone injured result charge like conspiracy negligence, encouraging self harm something like that. call manslaughter leads death. Big true. think right. Add already depressingly long list things U.S. last among world's wealthiest democracies.  agree you, fair, people worried sub-clinical cardiac damage might add time people get boosters -- cMRIs expensive we're generally able detect kind silent damage otherwise. 

To clear, thread explained damage going happen vaccine, vaccine mRNA can't bind cells. quick search shows CDC strongly recommending infected covid get vaccinated. searches found multiple research articles supporting this. doctor agenda ignoring CDC recommendations spinning story pretending agenda CDC support. mandatory countries? refer previous post. think form proof would helpful. think would help travel, especially international travel.   posters point. Women avoid putting LOTS things bodies pregnant protect unborn child normally would have. 

The trials actively include pregnant women, CDC left recommendation ‚Äúwomen decide doctors‚Äù tough spot put women. feel like almost inevitable everyone. I'm fence ""proof"" argument. Leaning towards required.
When CDC said masks longer required, unvaxed still mask via ""honor system"" still mess 
By removing passport,they basically threw hands air solely reliant maximum vaccinated. people vaccinated earlier stages, need boosters soon Fauci said much last week believe. I've definitely considered it. surprised administrators strict requiring proof age little ones - even requiring go pediatrician get shot. pregnant, well pandemic, female family friends (a pregnant time well), questioning getting Tdap influenza vaccinations; claimed ever told needed vaccines intentions getting vaccinated. surprisingly, also people currently vaccinated COVID.

It's great access tests, wish Canada, would game-changer.  
Your Mom's boss!    COVID sense taste smell still isnt year later. It‚Äôs much better used though, everything used smell like rotting garbage something. certain foods smell weird 74% total population state least 1 dose, 66% total population fully vaccinated. Considering 0-12 still can't get that's pretty good rate among eligible population. aunt *terrified* happen unvaccinated son DIL three young kids. afraid take care kids length time one parents get sick, let alone raise help raise one parents die. I'm provax, doubt last words. me, would something towards kids. since ""load"" people likely survive gain immunity naturally - hence herd immunity.

See above. Also Polio hardly fair comparison Covid. catch disease young enough healthy 99.9% chance surivial without long lasting effects. Studies shown infection + vaccination better preventing reinfection simply infected.

Infection provide something though. breakthrough infections running 40% say...

That people received 1 doses July. double dosed spread going happen matter what, even everyone vaccinated

But given unvaccinated people spread contract - would obviously improvement public health keep away. quit CNA work pays almost minimum wage even pandemic. saw news nursing homes evacuated nobody showed work. people run nursing homes hyper focused getting cheap labor even attempt use volunteers street help care residents. disgusting.

and I'm getting covid nine dollars hour bringing home kids. We‚Äôre conditioned panic case numbers think comes point doesn‚Äôt tell story pre-vaccine. Eliminating Covid never going happen vaccines turn public health crisis head cold, that‚Äôs finish line. restrictions:

All make sense curbing spread inside country. travel restrictions prevent new strains arriving Israel.  
I wish travel restrictions here. There's like 10,000 news stories. Problem denial people cultists, care anything.  Even worse respect others willing wear mask. got dirty stare grocery store beginning pandemic mask face shield. woman went way make know glaring me. clearly angry me.   actual headline says ""could reveal"", ""can reveal"", less definitive. goes say, ""the test identified quarter people got worse."" mention many false positives. Sounds pretty useless. You‚Äôre kidding right? think people didn‚Äôt get vaccinated life insurance?!? NFW  What's sad many Americans fail realize countries virus control.

And Americans still scream ""freedom"" idea real persecution is. medical doctor's opinion irrelevant lockdowns vaccine mandates? think least one leader past year really would liked declare particular viewpoint officially untrue. unvaccinated people previously infection? Previous asymptomatic infection? Previous mild infection? Previous severe infection? long ago? maybe still dragon (referring Shrek course) ones bad enough symptoms like outlier  turning away? need educated held accountable. ""I cannot driveth fifty-five. Thus sayeth Saint Hagar."" depressing HCA story. CIA didn‚Äôt us favors using fake polio vaccine campaign front spying.  wish this.

Based states experiencing Covid retraction except Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Maine, Ohio. those, Ohio seem peak soon. model shows cases decreasing state, average takes week real world testing peaks. give time see peak state yet.

In adition, seeing *all time low rates transmission* here: California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Texas, Washington

Transmission nearing time low (within 0.1) here: Arizona, Arkansas, D.C., Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming

Based *extremely* low rates transmission, hope stage pandemic.

 know commenter talking about, natural immunity 6x greater. heard that.

So kinds factors, immunity B cells measured antibody tests. 

They conclude vaccines much better natural immunity known quantity, even thouh wearing off, waning greater natural infection. course,they want suggest anyone remain unvaccinated get natural infection. People can't rely infected last year, may mild infection, case immunity would wearing now. 

The whole subject quite complex. know best thing get vaccinated.

It's corporately socialist country world. Vaccines 80% keep R0 1.

The unvaccinated remaining UK enough overwhelm hospitals. That's 13 million people remaining top people end ICU fully vaccinated definitely still happening. 

If R0 1, going problems, reason ends earlier waves restrictions implemented. 

Alberta (Canada) vaccinated well UK right now, almost restrictions, hospitals currently operating maximum capacity, non-essential surgeries cancelled shift staff dealing Corona cases. Cases still climbing, re-implement mask mandates.

Japan initially struggled get Covid-19 vaccination program full gear, has, percentage population received least one dose edged past level achieved United States ‚Äî leaving Americans last category among world‚Äôs seven wealthiest large democracies.

The turning point came Thursday, World Data, project University Oxford England, reported 62.16 percent Japanese people least partially vaccinated, compared 61.94 percent Americans.

For moment, United States retains slightly larger percentage fully vaccinated people Japan, 52.76 percent compared 50.04 percent, according World Data, ranking sixth Group 7 nations, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy. United States appears certain fall last place among Group 7 nations shortly, given rapid pace achieving full vaccinations Japan extremely slow rate United States.

Between July 24 Sept. 9, full vaccination rate United States grew around 4 percent, period Japan lifted level 25 percent, jump doubled size fully vaccinated population. Using doses made Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca, Japan administering million vaccine doses per day, 300,000 U.S. average, even though U.S. population 2.6 times size Japan‚Äôs.

In Japan, new cases fallen sharply peak 23,083 Aug. 25 11,347 Friday, though Japan confront dramatic rise new cases July August, coinciding Olympics. United States, cases spiked starting early July.

Canada leads G7 countries vaccination rates, almost three-quarters population least partially vaccinated Thursday, according World Data. France, Italy Britain follow, percentages 70 73. Germany‚Äôs rate ahead Japan‚Äôs, around 65 percent.

I think posts deleted moderators speaks itself. I‚Äôm finished here. vaccinated? you? so, would worry. I've seen 80-something in-laws 5 times since vaccinated.

Kids infinitesimal risk getting sick kind day care preschool situation they'll probably exposed anyway. got 2020. put June year. Miss lot. could literally written message. idea helped, mother got 3rd pfizer shot couple weeks ago. May worth try.  mask keep social distancing. may suck now, gonna suck lot people die Covid. wish ~~Redskins~~ WFT still suck.  would go worry. Statistically 2 year old infinitesimal risk getting sick, vaccinated. I'd cautious like around unvaccinated grandparents something.

Note areas, even recommending vaccinating kids risk low benefit vaccine low. UK recently decided age 12-15.  wife serious side effects J&amp;J including high fever, side effects lasted 36 hours button abruptly subsided. 2 kids absolutely side effects Pfizer. However, son recently got MMR booster ran 103F fever 2 days.

Almost everyone heard side effects stop within 48 hours. get anti-reflective coating, scratch-proof coating like price?  mean it‚Äôs pretty free NYC. I‚Äôve getting covid tested average twice month since last august. I‚Äôve paid 0 dollars since covid tests covered full insurance company. 

Isn‚Äôt true around US insurance must cover covid testing full? article delta affects data trending way week. think approaching herd immunity looks like... declining waves breakouts.

And makes sense. forget waves cases leave behind immunity. Definitely preferred option spreading immunity happen. every reported case 4-5 others.

Florida gets bad rap (deservedly so) actually average vaccination rates, 65%, 18th among US states. plus lax policies, schools open, etc must mean large majority population immune. Covid passes (which includes negative test) going work 60% vaccination coverage young people. know we're allowing unvaccinated people use pass breakthrough infections pretty much guaranteed delta. ...Is headline make clinical trial Covid-19 vaccine children sound menacing really is? resistant Delta? gyn wife first pregnancy checked sorts boxes maternal pass, freely use/do several diagnosis things regularly could charge health insurance (Germany, private insurance). never even told us checked boxes behaved amount testing normal. Ofc found never went back him, stuff like sadly pretty common. Beat it.   fact, way test conducted, uncommon. searches two parts viral rna found. If, example, false positive chance 1%, odds false positive test would 0.01*0.01 = 0.0001, almost nothing. hand would need high viral load positive antigen test. blood clot risk like 0.001%, 1%, doctors know recognize it, rarely fatal. worried call doctor infinitesimal risk. understand creates inequity right now

So you‚Äôre okay providing inequity Black Americans because‚Ä¶ again?  atheist think might actually end good thing say report one. numbers important. Two doses tells people already vaccinated one doses tells people likely vaccinated 3 weeks(depending amount time country leaves doses).

One dose still tells who's board vaccination. selfish people cheat test results? vaccines come vial? 

Pfizer 0.3ml AZ 0.5 ml terms dosing -- think need different needles, would they? Needle size ideally selected ft patient, depending BMI, intramuscular injection needs go layer fat get muscle.

When got vaccinated Pfizer, specifically asked type needle using different second shot vs first. nurse said run first type needle. think needle came vaccine, think using whatever needles made logical sense. Ah, ok, thank info. That's actually quite reassuring plans, although wonder whether government pull back create large restrictions (and if) virus ends spreading quite bit travel opens back up. can't imagine amazing prevention implement lockdowns time ends large outbreak. Looks like need Boosters person lived worked projects South Bronx Harlem decade, understand creates inequity right now, understand Black Americans good reason suspicious deny vaccine. people religion also vaccinated well. horrifying inequity, we're point everyone needs walk local Duane Reade protect themselves, families community free. 

I believe matters whether concert, air travel, school even restaurant...people need recognize vaccinated, eventually get Covid likely give Covid others. I've heard 2-5 age group could authorized weeks 5-11 age group. I've got fingers crossed November. good point really wish level testing reported along cases clearly testing cases find, vice versa. people self-select i.e. volunteer testing probably based see news. testing leads cases leads testing. article originally PTI.

First one, vaccine doesn‚Äôt stick around body long term, gets filtered leaves body. there‚Äôs continued exposure, did, didn‚Äôt need second booster shot. quite intense chest pains starting 2 days first Pfizer shot. Required ER visit day 10 pain spread neck back. ECG, ultrasound, x-ray bloods (troponin) came back normal. medical history, fit, 34, male, meds.

I imagine think need wear mask inside anymore fuck can't get vaccine.  Sure, lots people bring health problems. crisis standards care never reached western medicine way Idaho. think antivaxers punished, vaxxed people likely survive (generally) even cases unvaxxed likely live, receive healthcare that's directive works. yes, people self-inflicted health problems also eliminated ICU rationing due sheer volume patients. built huge hospital 6 days, brought 30,000 medical workers Wuhan. ignoring too. day learned that, late January 2020, woke thought, Whoa, epidemic something better pay attention immediately.

That's crazy me. around every 7-8 years. Yes read exact opposite.

Yeah apparently lot people ZERO critical thinking skills ability make anything resembling sound value-based judgement, wandering around among us living lives. understand huge problem disinformation, point brain capable anything beyond responding stimulus purely animalistic level, choice (and analysis risks) fucking obvious.

I'm denying possibility, I'll believe I've read paper.

By way, never heard TWIV Google it.

US one countries planet could walk places without appointment get vaccine. countries often months long waiting lists get one. delivery rate curve big part this.

Out 46k vaccinated cases, 3k hospitalized

These numbers period delta ramping prevalence. probably actually worse mostly delta scenario like UK experiencing. 

The interesting thing saying reduced hospitalization vaccinated persons shown numbers, vaccinated unvaccinated 6% people confirmed COVID case hospitalized. Obviously far less cases vaccinated people, they're still catching quite regularly. 

In UK, 6% unvaccinated (at 80% Vaccination) means 6% 13 million, shy 800k people unvaccinated hospitalized. 

If 6% applies vaccinated people catch it, means 6% total population hospitalized, would 3 million people hospitalized . Even assume 10% vaccinated people catch it, that's another 100k fully vaccinated people ending hospital. 

You've already 500k people hospitalized COVID last year half, stressed system significantly cancelled lots routine medical work. bare minimum, potentially 2-3 million people vaccinated people start catching larger numbers due waning personal protection choices vaccine effectiveness drop off.

FluMist though, wanted nasal spray instead shot, Walgreens doesn‚Äôt it.  know are, I've seen enough comments Reddit, still wonder loud minority. There's difference miscarriage (before 20 weeks pregnant) stillbirth/fetal death (after 20 weeks). may *both* increases miscarriage covid, fetal death covid, body reacts differently different points pregnancy important clear. 

Typically miscarriage happens prior 12 weeks, rate approximately 20% known pregnancies. Rates miscarriage vaccine line this. often misquoted part vaccine study ""20% vaccinated pregnant woman miscarried"" yes - 20% control group miscarried. 

Typically 20 weeks stresses women's body increases (although first 12 weeks nausea intense) changes mother's body supports larger larger fetus. Maternal death skyrocketing well. 

While viability increases every week possible fetus live outside mother sometime around 24 weeks. fetal deaths able diagnosed, miscarriage however often diagnosed sometimes spontaneous, damn common even investigate miscarry unless 3 more. 

Either way, covid outcomes far worse possible complications vaccinated baby mother.

I got Vibrio eating raw oyster years back nasty stomach issue landed ER. dont recall exact numbers ER tried charge 6000 dollars something similar literally bag fluid pain pill. Insurance said no, paid around 600 instead (which still insane)

That's train animals small children, giving treat order teach right thing. freeeeee-damned.  Near area sluggish 39.99%.  City held sweepstakes, gave away tons free merch, gift cards cash. moved needle. fun $30000 deductible ;) 

(I actually live States, thank goodness, passing knowledge health insurance works there. assume $30k deductible reasonably high rate) Canada announced mandatory proof full vaccination domestic air train travel couple weeks ago (not sure place yet travelling). even option negative test instead. it. Breakthrough cases 1 10,000 mandatory testing vaccinated people colossal waste time. People understand statistics. deluded mind, think saveing people shot percentage reduced.. bit case raw number?
 
1% today might actually raw number compared 2% July total cases much higher today.. might actually gaining..

He's waiting see 'what happens people' year two vaccine (he's mentioned conspiracy type stuff before) that's gotten vaccine.

We fairly civil otherwise. I've seen older men (50+), stay home moms spend day reading conspiracy theories facebook.

But group younger cousins think unnecessary too, dont view conspiracy, dont think they'll get Covid bad. people least may get vax jobs require them. Smh bogus articles counting beginning year ""... access vaccine, long time world vaccinated""

All reason get vaccinated so. However talking can't medically get vaccinated, talking individuals refuse get vaccine based nothing superstition, anti-social behavioral traits, steeped conspiratorial thinking, yes acting immaturely. 

Those individuals responsible increase deaths infections, physicians hospitals across country attest. vast vast majority dying unvaccinated. enough vaccine countries United States effectively end pandemic. longer hold outs last, likely see variants, worse delta, still chance one could immerge. 

So far nothing convinced skeptical vaccine. watched family members suffer die still refuse vaccinated. Others taunted lost loved ones turned advocating vaccinations. behavior described, insult refer behavior honest amounted to. 

The bottom line reasonable logical reason resist vaccinations healthy individual. would call someone refuses listen doctors, refuses listen facts, continual peddles conspiracy theories, devoted life study treatment disease? ""ignorant"" accurate description.

It looks though USA get good deal immunity via suffering via science. may sterlizing immunity come people two three shots plus exposure, series shot, idea moment. may get shots seasonally endemic. global socialism; necessary save us capitalist/corporatist fuckery would cost millions lives put hold order people.

Swedens situation different Denmark - case numbers increased 3x past month. also tend test children mild symptoms. age group highest infection rate steepest rise neighbouring countries. country Europe doesn‚Äôt vaccinate 12-15 year olds. interesting see happens lift restrictions weeks. provincial healthcare body mandated vaccines employees contract workers. largest employer province, including nurses. 

I saw nurses union put statement would represent nurses terminated ‚Äúdiscriminatory religious belief illness/disability‚Äù also said effectively vaccines work, get vaccinated unless exemption like actually applies. see plays nurses terminated. 

Also wonder vaccinated nurses file grievances exposed unsafe working environment unvaccinated nurses? fear happen get mandatory testing - administration see raw cases high (when vaccine isn‚Äôt meant prevent infection), overreact, go remote. reminds CDC said wear masks, masking shortages HCW...

I agree vax global issue national approach open borders short sighted best. 

However, Equity perceived public confidence past messaging benchmark science. likely. people writing dictionaries know they're descriptivist.

The people CITING dictionaries they're prescriptivist (because else would need refer authority word?). Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

If cases surge region, people start acting differently, taking personal precautions. Often comes hand hand government regulations well, always. 

They're called waves reason, cases spike, people change behavior, cases drop, people relax behavior, cases spike, repeat. 

The problem come vaccinated people change behavior response spike, create much larger spike unvaccinated. one reasons we're seeing health authorities implement vaccine passport systems many places. worldwide, production capacity still match demand. So, although amount vaccines ""fixed"", still insufficient. would say two things simultaneously true:

1. young vaccinated person, actual risk serious complications COVID-19 non-zero low, even international travel going somewhere high case count. really looking forward trip looking honest risk assessment whether safe go way dangerous risk, answer pretty safe go. (If living elderly person someone else might vulnerable, might change assessment.)
2. two extremely low risk tolerance feel extremely anxious unsafe this, make enjoyable trip, feel bad canceling maybe eating cost that's two feel like need do. HHS Data comes Hospitals direct reports federal government provides good look data ""vetted"" buy Florida health department. Current Adult hospitalizations 11,379 17,000 couple weeks ago. daily admission numbers also down. Average length hospital stay remined consistent last several months around 6 days. take today's admissions multiply 6 get around 8,200. another indicator hospitalizations trending down. Note Kentucky looks particularly bad using metric current daily admission support total hospitalized rate 71% currently at. could get ugly there.

The Hospitals also report deaths daily. Caveat would deaths yet vetted due Covid numbers would also pick people died home. 7 day average Covid deaths reported hospitals peaked last week around 280 per day. last four days saw deaths reported 223, 240, 220, 236. slowly trending still way high. Based deaths last month ramped likely see average around 200 deaths per day next month Florida. add additional 6,000 deaths state increasing total deaths 12% one month. 

For reference note Florida hospitals reported 18 Covid Deaths July 1, 81 August 1st, 274 September 1st. Florida passed peak death curve unfortunately many deaths come death levels back July 1 levels. would guess back July levels early November assuming another wave begun then. main point vaccines protect severe/death - ended bonus protected catching covid too.

No, Primary endpoints efficacy symptomatic infection adverse events (safety). Efficacy severe Covid-19 secondary endpoint.

This applies AstraZeneca: also true jobs. retirements? Oklahoma- sick called lives matter idiots ! lives matter - get vaccine ? Around 70% deaths double vaccinated period detailed last Public Health England covid surveillance report.

Since many people UK vaccinated especially older age groups, actually mean vaccines preventing death, nowhere near efficacy statistic article would believe. bad can't put vaccine drinking water. Oh well. Problem solve soon enough, lot states much competitive next election.

When got vaccine weepy. I'm crier.  wait y‚Äôall see Omega variant
- God  1st shot nothing soreness, 2nd shot little sick tired jacked tylenol advil wasn‚Äôt miserable, 3rd shot much like first. (3x pfizer, booster 5 months) part specifically referring to? Something like 5 billion doses given worldwide. Every person know says stuff like smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol, constantly fill body terrible junk crap consistently. seems SARS2 established niche lifecycle 1 - 2 week period suppresses immune signaling innate immune response enough proliferate spread gets overwhelmed active immune system infection ends. (Obviously everyone, most). seems rely early immune suppression/very efficient transmission/very efficient cell entry rapid proliferation classic escape antibodies prolonged infection. several variants better antibody escape Delta, fizzled. Escape adaptive immune system doesn‚Äôt seem potent selection factor virus. Hello, nice eat you. original vaccine waning, would wager boosters would last longer well. know there‚Äôs constant data coming new things learned time goes on, it‚Äôs frustrating seeing conflicting things (like vaccine waning anywhere 5-8 months) wondering accurate especially headlines click baiting maybe findings posted prematurely. window selfishness. 99% population vaccinated much different 100%. young illness rarely fatal. looking weeks discomfort unlikely months long covid. shots day discomfort. 

If really care anyone else would care elderly vulnerable dying? Probably would still want employ us. genuinely psychopathic person healthy/young would still encourage everyone else get vaccine. like ""if zombies chase us tripping you"". I‚Äôm right across border husband putting house sale don‚Äôt feel comfortable anymore. 14 years longer ‚Äúfit‚Äù are. Turns neighbors don‚Äôt actually look other. time insisted otherwise. lied. wouldn‚Äôt surprise FDA comes saying boosters immunocompromised general public. need get 12 vaccine approved sooner later though. agree need start thinking countries getting vaccinated. everything want US world good vaccination clip virus highs lows. hate one dose reporting now. care one dose. want know percentage fully vaccinated.  it‚Äôs safe give kids Easy solution: fire unvaxxed. thing everyone ignoring spread. 40% population got boosters, boosters reduced spread 10%, 4% reduction spread overall. unintuitively, 4% reduction spread could actually result cutting cases, hospitalizations, deaths quarter. Boosters could easily difference full hospitals almost full hospitals. interesting point fair, flights would consider Europe country country, within Schengen area.  trusting science believe experts. doctor, scientist, epidemiologist data supports boosters fine that. believe data needs shown people like diabetic, heart disease, high blood pressure, etc. determine get benefit booster shots. Currently boosters immunocompromised others comorbidities. would help provide reassurance people like vaxed Dec-March. I'm introvert, homebody, since became fully vaccinated, I've going restaurants, spending time coworkers, went Yankees game, enjoying more. definitely boosted mental health, great, definitely feel comfortable safer still masking up. state also one highest vaccination rates, feel comfortable going out.   I‚Äôm Yankees fan true believer? /s actually read paper? argument ""people getting first shots important"". scientific data. scientific data coming Israel successfully fucking delta booster. start quarantine dad got quick test hospital went quarantine ended day two later went take actual one came back positive, mean time quarantine nobody went take test bc dad drive don‚Äôt see wouldn‚Äôt tap another letter continue iteration. So, Alpha Alpha, Alpha Beta, Alpha Gamma, etc. really doesn‚Äôt require lot thought put concept. happens run Greek letters?

Hopefully Biden ""mandate"" make difference. black white, will-reinfect cant-reinfect. reduction, complete cancellation. Delta also can-but-doesn't-always reinfect OG covid survivors. Yep. Thankfully they're already allowed. Full authorization meant doctors write prescriptions boosters, among things. Yes, that's scientific term used immune response that's aggressive successful pathogen chance take hold, infect reproduce uninhibited. Misspelling comments TIGHT. Oh no! Hope birthday fast approaching. panic needed point. Study vitro. Vaccines still work. Delta remain dominant. Keep masking distance, also protect influenza common cold beginning soon. all: get vaccinated. thought single layer stretchy buffs bad enough; fishnets, got kidding me. Blake: ""At current moment, hospitalizations cases decline."" vaccines amazing yet another example deceptive headline. second half last year vaccinated people made 0% deaths! relevant information vaccinated vs unvaccinated risks, absolute numbers. really think need donating doses using boosters.  Like what? surges seen measures loosened naturally dropped stabilized after, prompting even relaxation feels dirty cheering insurance companies, instance fully support them. Folks got 3rd shot Pfizer/Moderna, comparable side effects #3 opposed first 2? 2nd shot Pfizer super lethargic, little feverish, bad headache 2 days considering 3rd soon what's considered autoimmune disease. really sucks must relief support. Exactly. statement vaccine hesitancy, current protection. wife invited bachelorette party Jamaica coming soon. Jamaica CDC level 3 travel advisory reluctantly agreed it, level 4 wants cancel. Canceling would mean another girl able go (its booked pairs place they're staying, dont ask involved booking trip) would mean pay half booking. guys think? Worth eating cost, would feel comfortable going fully vaccinated younger person. 

We're leaning toward canceling, curious hear anyone else thinks. ""Level 4"" sounds scary but, *a lot* places level 4, including US. maybe we're overreacting two fold increase Delta lower Delta vs original, quite bit iirc. that's true probably can't escape boosters memory system ramps production. Wasn‚Äôt story immune compromised patient England Alpha started? Maybe debunked.

Edit: here‚Äôs one story Science dec 2020, [U.K. variant puts spotlight immunocompromised patients' role COVID-19 pandemic weakened immune system may give virus chance evolve rapidly, scientists don‚Äôt know anything known. I'm sure conclusion new @TheLancet viewpoint international panel boosters: ""To date, none studies provided evidence substantially declining protection severe disease."" change w/ week's @NEJM Israel report, Pfizerüíâ, age Spokane WA gets drinking water underground aquifer, large extends state border. Years ago Idaho decided build train refueling station right side aquifer. ""Don't that,"" Spokane WA said. ""If leaks pollute drinking water.""

But Idaho built anyway caring neighbor (or environment) wimps. Within six months train refueling station polluting aquifer.

And that, metaphorically well literally, like live next Idaho. 2019-2020 flu season, 195 kids died according normal year, kids schools, masks, etc. 

In 2020-2021 flu season, March 1 child died flu (same article). Keeping kids school, masking, social distancing, etc reduced risk flu much. 

In last year half, 400+ kids died Covid. That's even though schools closed, kids wearing masks, parents offices, people traveling, etc. mostly Delta, transmissible original strain. Yes, 400 small number, relatively. Yes, probably children die normal year school buses swimming pools (I look up, taking word it). 400 time taking great measures mitigate risk. 

Now stopping lot measures. Parents back offices, kids back schools, much less effort going towards masking distancing. parents teachers vaccinated, helps little, many facing Delta, spreads easily. circumstances vastly different. would expect risk remain same? say enough information know happen, true, cuts ways. know next year going look like terms child deaths, sitting sure looks like society care.  sure this. understand people working public settings getting fired refusing vaccinated. issues insurance companies pulling benefits people‚Äôs behavior (raising rates different, though). would enormous repercussions insurance companies could rule behavior choices profits denying coverage. would line be: smoking? Drinking? Eating meat? eating meat? point don‚Äôt care anymore.

Third dose = similar first teensy bit worse. Armpit still sore week swollen glands, really worst symptom. Yeah, boosters basically way already safe people make sure stay safe stop spread even little bit more.

For people's personal health, boosters likely needed.

Over protect willing let cards fall may everyone else seems current policy. 80% coverage nearly enough herd immunity Delta

There‚Äôs scientific basis belief, it‚Äôs panic. direct evidence delta transmissible begin with. It‚Äôs fit, precisely determined. Maybe 95% would be

This would mean it‚Äôs much transmissible measles. really think clue reasonable concern. mention fact Delta happy infect spread vaccinated people reasonably high numbers too

So we're still good. Yeah, difficult debate poor countries vaccination fear might get variant that's vaccine resistant, even moreso Delta efforts definitely want that.  I'd say decent definition plotting performance comparable developed areas, finding average, noticing it? average opinion.

Too many shipping issues getting exacerbated currently flawless rollout future vaccine. Depends type mask. Medical nk95/ffp2 protect others spreading it. Rather stick these. rather primitive fabric masks, used wear early months pandemic seem rather prevented spreading offer less protection others aswell. looked ICU numbers? overwhelming enough, people need continue things (Masking, distancing, etc.) order keep control.

Who's saying otherwise? I'm not.

I'm pointing using initial R value cases surge paint whole picture. R value invariably drops even little measures place ICU rates remain manageable. That's endemic COVID like people get used higher numbers, especially since vast majority infections mild symptomatic. Well possible everyone different definition ""below average"" means.

Second: called work fine.

Third: sore arm 3 days. lethargic. fever anything. 

All Pfizer/BNT. Third dose 10+ months second. Oh god that‚Äôs terrible. wish best üíú Pretty much, seeing bad people covid without chemo, imagine bad him. Looking current state medical professionals, teachers workers *thanked*: believe US probably needs figure ethics mean, making use bunch vaccines going waste anyway unethical‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs need wait fda approval (emergency full).

I'm glad dodged bullet hahaha Yes. enough data enable CDC recommendation would. recommendation means: better risk tiny chance mild myocarditis risk infection, comes also risk myocarditis severe vaccine related. cant understand mentioned two doctors, theres probably reason they're board CDC vaccine experts. personally experiences general practitioners giving wrong, bad vaccine advises. Lucky Idaho. near civilized states they'd fucked. Mend also mean repair, ""on mend"" mean ""you're repaired"". Apply health, means body recovering. That's Harambes said. feel like way many people understand difference fear caution. isn‚Äôt clear data need one Moderna, I‚Äôm going ama, that‚Äôs fucking stupid, I‚Äôll wait FDA approves booster shot Moderna. paid occasional memes :')

But gotten pretty fire memes, nice  find country. [our world data Turns it‚Äôs 5.71billion doses worldwide. show data booster appropriateness actually. said let's answer question whether boosters appropriate providing data showing vaccines effective. Look piece media coverage. Imagine unlimited shots, wanting wear mask 

Inject whatever, dare wear paper face!!! Interesting choice username - 2 hash functions... Link? Damn, hope getting paid well  First world country streets.

Third world country behind sheets. vaccine AstraZeneca. gap doses huge. I‚Äôm still waiting second one. felt like shit first time lol. hope second better. ""One source familiar proceedings said Reyes‚Äô office agreed slash transparency requirement became clear late August bill would move forward California Chamber Commerce opposed it.""

Do special power, enough sell-outs block it? state immune system qualified booster (Moderna) side effects, strangely, hit like Delta wave hitting ton places: swiftly worse second dose far sooner (12 hours opposed 2 days).

Didn‚Äôt feel anything first dose; second dose laid out. I‚Äôd endure catching COVID. guess rephrase then... There's damn good chance vote homeless. Clinics legislated hard reach locations timeline absurdly short.

It's like technically black people equal everything guaranteed weren't.

So yes ""legal"" also charged murder(in ideal world). like sued whatever. feel like hard say something's legal law also says punished exercising legal right. 38F here. getting booster soon it‚Äôs available me. son 3. congenital heart defect. cardiologist concerned myocarditis heart patients people children good general health. 

From I‚Äôve learned, myocarditis risk seems small risk younger males (age group 20 younger). state brought us Prop 65. Ridiculous I'm Columbus less half people live vaccinated. embarrassment.

Also, city fucking loves Jackets, crazy dumbass would lose job something trivial. Haha mean didn‚Äôt get meant wasn‚Äôt clear - time gone strange since March 2020 (both slowly fast) strange saying Friday two weeks ago! ü§™ Exactly. Also use little better marketing. Really getting total dose appropriate Delta, really true booster.  Thank you. Tried getting toddlers eat can't taste anything? two positive adults house two negative teens? eleven cases extended family, nine breakthrough cases. 

Vaxx + mask + distance + STFH. Curbside everything. know contact tracing church good you. church Internet service find better church. Family gatherings good you. Learn use video conferencing. Sports events good you. Buy big screen TV. Bars &amp; restaurants good you. STFH learn cook curbside pickup (no, takeout good enough). Schools looking real good. 

Yes, yes, long time. Yes, yes, tired. Suck buttercup. think residents London tired bombings WWII? Life real. blue ribbons.  pose risk others...what expecting? drink sides planet Friday covid ends  anyone know anti-vax mask crowd hang Reddit? Sometimes like read stuff piss off. find far-right party pretty fringe, getting 1.6% popular vote 2019. However, three (four count Green) major candidates strongly type hospital protest, even [Conservative party Floriberta forget one parties openly anti vaxx anti mask. thankfully 8% vote. Feels like 90% open idiocy country though. IKR? gave volunteering kids local children's hospital's vaccine trials. Like, emailing weekly, never replied back.  Yup. That's idea. ready comes knocking! something primary care provider do? see new pulmonologist week know medical history I'd like ask script.  google author, podcast Rand Paul. says all. Russia records 790-800 deaths consistently 3 months now. went 800 twice. Data manipulated.  mean IgA? 

Yeah predict COVID become low level endemic problem later (i.e. everyone's exposed enough longer huge concern) live attenuated nasal mists times year might order. may?  unreasonable

It's not, however literally throwing doses away US there's way doses going go countries focused here. choice boosters US/Europe vs first shots countries, boosters US/Europe throwing doses garbage. I'll take boosters. it. media failed us. politicians failed us.

The problem people take mistrust put doctors scientists. Yes, institutions failed us past part they‚Äôve extremely reliable. nobody told experts would choose leave cold months later??? understand changing conditions data virus itself, voluntary decision support J&amp;J level close vaccines, became less ""popular"". Using boosters UK would make little sense since UK operated different dosing schedule, rely completely Pfizer, seeing similar hospitalization results. 

There good evidence vaccines seeing strong drop efficacy like Pfizer, real reason vaccines need boosters soon. truth Israel important data point, relinance Pfizer may proved undoing. Israel 60% population fully vaccinated (plus percent recovered + percent one dose).

Yet number cases stable severe cases.

Few restrictions vaccinated individuals (indoor mask mandate).

So 80% fully vaccinated seems enough get back normal. Well since lost one parents last year due covid I'm still feeling pretty depressed even fully vaccinated.     Generally speaking theory south's numbers high summer people inside AC hot north people spend time outside compared winter. north's numbers higher fall/winter people inside cold south people head outside fall. Obviously low vaccinations south playing huge role regions spike different times. 

Now school starting NY weather getting colder sending people indoors going face problems last year. Yes lot vaccinated people still millions unvaccinated New Yorkers. wont bad last year think see spike lower numbers we're seeing now. Nowhere near FL levels instance think we're woods yet. [Poe's  3rd Moderna came 6mo 2nd shot. kicked ass 2-3 days still bad. Lots chills, sweats, inability sleep times lots exhaustion times. Thanks edited it. Someone bragging yesterday one wearing masks wake county. No, sorry, not. imposition actually vulnerable unreasonably scared insist 300 million people adhere risk tolerances. response entire covid problem. think see response over. truly vulnerable, sorry. Either way, need take precautions protect yourself.

Please stop spreading misinformation risks covid. Players different story union, coaches leverage really expect fired refuse vaccinate point.   Test 3-5 days exposure you‚Äôre good go. sounds like you‚Äôll fine pretty low risk situation. 

And don‚Äôt livid, kids can‚Äôt help it. can‚Äôt vaccinated kids go school pretty unsafe conditions days comes Covid.  Exactly. boosters needed idiots never got shots. Seems like common sense. Got reduce intelligent population much possibly morons die. get it. saw 75 percent adults 1 shot ore more. Bur yeah places like
Idaho, whereni live, oklahoma. dunno
Its good. Cells bad. uncle lives cell. ten foot twelve read boring, old magazine everyday. end. Everybody's waiting OSHA regulation attached deadlines, come yet. need wade shit storm gets here. Dude..  Seems like like realistic dangers Covid, also recognize won‚Äôt horrible forever. Vaccines work. People adapt. know, winter final rough spot get this. recall technician giving vaccine commenting Pfizer popular area Moderna way less common; start defrosting vaccine finished filling paperwork. 

I think waited 25-30 minutes vaccine defrost... Probably long enough idk   fear, absolutely.

The idea global pandemic crush like bug there's absolutely nothing stay 100% safe fundamentally terrifying.

But vaccine actually microchip delivery system deaths fake, that's comforting. safe. get chipped

Or cure disease available local farm supply store, that's comforting too. safe, get cure you. orders magnitude common covid itself.

I think they're little dishonest implying anything millions one chance booster shot worse breakthrough infection; also neglected mention Israel keeping track booster side effects found significant risk, placing lower bound frequently could occur.

Granted step outside evidence mRNA vaccines, vaccine types that's probably valid concern. probably fine. J&amp;J vaccine targeted similar way. instructs cells produce spike protein (as mRNA vaccines) using different vector: disarmed adenovirus. nothing like actual COVID-19 infection. I'm immunologist, think even inactivated virus vaccines would cause issue, use adjuvants (alum, CpG, etc) boost immune system's response. Okay?

If people would get vaccinated mess.


If unvaxxed, fault. widely available months US Lol  It‚Äôs small campus. student 90s think city pop 1M, even bigger.  Yes Moderna. fully vaccinated since April 2 That's assuming get infected show symptoms chances even less. According CDC (assuming came close contact someone COVID-19 get tested 3-5 days date exposure wear mask public indoor settings 14 days exposure negative test result.

You totally fine trip.

**Edit:** Yeah cancer often comes back years later. covid dont Yep. understand India stopping exports since healthcare capacity developed world absolutely massive outbreak.

But EU never stopped exporting, US could easily done same. Instead decided immediately ship vaccines every little pharmacy bumfuck Montana without even considering whether people actually even going want them.  OK, big problem bat- classification mild asymptomatic O2 levels. Low O2 reason hospitalized covid ignores blood clots, dehydration, complications diabetes brought covid infection, heart kidney issues.

Furthermore, high risk hospitalized seek antibody therapies need delivered intravenously, still using hospital resources.

Lastly, covid positive patient, even admitted reasons, still poses strain hospital resources require closer monitoring must kept isolated non covid patients may higher risk covid infected.

The article seems trying make sound like high hospitalizations non issue low O2 levels, ignores still straining medical resources hospitals. People admitted reason patients require varying degrees medical care. already numbers track severe cases- general hospitalizations ICU number patients intubated.  vaccinated? came like frustrated mother law get sick die covid. know probably mean way, made laugh Quit poisoning well. nothing liberal progressive ideals. shit hit hard whilst chemo fucking immunse system.    Well I'm married husband vaccinated, kinda thing. unacceptable strongly destroys faith ""the experts"". feel J&amp;J right choice given circumstances back then, known sad support would now, would never gotten it.

But experts recommended data available time. like think right choice then. made decision then-available information would trust experts now? ""That's tumour, that's head."" clinic went wrong. Moderna's booster half dosage first two.  data comes 344 volunteers got additional dose vaccine part clinical study. Antibodies waned six months vaccination, company said, third shot boosted antibodies even higher point seen initial shots, **even though booster half original dose**. increased protection ""achieved across age groups, notably older adults (ages 65 above),"" company said.  Well, really, given many people ask questions like daily threads, disingenuous ""question threads"" antivax subreddits (have look comment history one).

The question usually ""Given evolution, come viruses mutate become resistant vaccines right away?""

And link studies like  CDC recommends it, means scientific evidence support idea benefit outweigh risks. Whatever myocarditis risk carefully quantified review numbers choose to. point, absolutely. I'm stoked seemed beat cancer COVID? Guy's American treasure. oil, there's timber precious metals. Get it. Florida doesn‚Äôt release daily death numbers anymore Israel world class experts health authority too. can't compare choosing world class expert making better case listening fringe lunatics. 

Then look precise arguments made. They're saying ""there's benefit"", they're saying ""the benefit enough justify ethical issue""... that's pure opinion, scientific fact. think 90-95% effectiveness severe disease *does* justify booster disagree ethical case refusal, that's contradicting scientific facts like antivaxxers.  brilliant. put bags back forget take store me, never really thought use cart literally bag getting everything ü§Ø Israeli here. 22 year old, got second dose around January 3rd two weeks ago. second dose felt bad, mostly chills muscle aches, sore arm too. 3rd symptoms fever too, went away day. worth it. Franklin County‚Äôs population ~1.3M. 
OSU staff students ~100,000. 

So ~7% population. actually higher expected. Many people choice staying home. They're forced work public people wear masks, distance, engage manner activities high likelihood contracting spreading disease. absolutely imposition risk someone else. Whether see that.

Now, understand frustration desire normalcy that's entire post I'm sure understand response. understand people followed rules 18 months starting engage again. honest. imposition risk onto others. That's fact. Oh! Pick kid please! download whatever tracking app! I‚Äôm taking it. want protection holidays. not. tried get one today told dosage. puts (phonetic) 'dense' 'presidency' nice work public school NYC everyone must vaccinated lose position.  combination people overly worried, mixed messages CDC officials. Fauci wore one mask got vaccinated, started wearing two masks. send confusing message. Truth vaccinated well protected safe lot people get message.

Then hear comments ""viral load"" vaccinated people ""can"" still spread virus, starts sound people like vaccines anything all. essentially casts doubt understandably makes many people worry. would officials undercutting credibility vaccines? feel like dichotomy terrible vaccination rates plus ""lets ignore surge nothing stop it"" plus ""hey whats going fall super spread this"". 

SIGH. I've long suspected number Ride Die anti-vax types less expected. People talk big game ""Patriot Dads 4 Freedom"" Facebook Groups pain comes via fines/risk losing job suddenly tough guy act online starts looking lot dumber. 20 likes meme repost bros online pay bills.   cares? choice. Take free vaccine pay regularly months tests get infected sooner later. paid 150 pair son supposed wear doesn‚Äôt.  though got decent price!!  I‚Äôll try zenni next pair parents got tested 2 week isolation today test came positive ofc, shouldve tested didn't.


And doctor said quarantine another 10 days 


And school hour, think said anything since get tested I've feeling normal week LOL @ people think rights airplane. Sit yo ass down. privilege fly, pilot command's aircraft. kicked plane, tough shit. I‚Äôm really glad many people visual learners seems lacking anti-vaxxers can‚Äôt even interpret bar graphs. [Not  Kids infinitesimal risk virus, point areas even recommending vaccinating them, like UK recently decided vaccinate age 12-15 unless serious health conditions. Younger kids even less risk.

Your unvaccinated friends buttheads kid tiny risk, main risk would kid got hung around unvaccinated grandparents something. understanding dosing size/weight dependant, rather younger children's immune systems much responsive. insane thing this, intelligent/educated country, person gave shit themself would still get vaccine. twitter thread shows breakdown cases state strain, showing Delta wave dominant almost everywhere including $14 kit comes 2 test. purchased 4 local store. fucking vaccine

So, bottom line, you‚Äôre okay denying 72% Black Americans NYC ability air travel ‚Äúget fucking vaccine.‚Äù? 

Simple question. see vaccines effective known variants including delta. Exactly! worked drank days got 2 shots never issue.

You're overthinking it. get shot. fine. least decent vaccines live administering deactivated virus vaccines instead MRNA ones. I'm thinking behavior, lack thereof, bode well behaviors lifestyle changes needed citizens related future crises man-made climate change. 700k day ""screeching halt""?  Still completely mind boggling vaccines mandated health care workers day one. Black Americans withheld medical treatment Tuskegee. case now. Noone withholding vaccines Black Americans. far understand reproduction number R number individuals infected individuals infect. number infected individuals grow exponentially. (as long R constant)

The basic reproduction number R0 reproduction number population natural immunity vaccinated individuals. Note R0 independent number vaccinated people. vaccinate enough people end situation R&lt;1 whereas 1. Tuskegee, ""Tuskgee"".
2. assume know race apparent ""privilege"".
3. Get fucking vaccine eventually get sick get others sick. pretty simple dude. home Relax. commenting shitty healthcare system is, trying insult anyone else. pretty obvious. Stop trying create drama none. trials kids 12. Walmart $14 dollars. picked 4 them. every right pissed off. think saying something playing currently. see reports ""30% cases among vaccinated"" etc.

So think it. Say breakthrough cases 1 10,000 10 times likely get unvaccinated, 1 1,000. Say population 75% vaccinated. ratio unvaccinated vaccinated cases 4:1. even though vaccinated people protected, them, significant number cases.

Or look another way, vaccinated population US 180 million, breakthrough rate 1 10,000 that's still 18,000 cases. give 1 million vaccinations day, statistically 100 still get virus. Even virus far common among unvaccinated, still present among vaccinated.

But another variable transmission far higher among unvaccinated. 25% population enough unvaccinated people keep virus alive spreading really driving cases. cut fewer cases anyone has. get something like 10% think game over. Yes, mention thought. dad got third shot psoriasis arthritis. Even though boosters officially start later month, lot places third shot completely books doctor's note. might something look into!  exit plan get highly vaccinated population open terms. Nobody really believed COVID zero sustainable forever smaller, isolated countries like NZ Australia opportunities Europe America's that's pursued. Australia hand forced bit sooner expected Delta strain.

I'm aware that's plan - I'm saying Delta gone window. Trying constantly get zero silly. Australia appear realized controlled reopening borders etc sensible, especially since there's breakthrough infections anyway. Cases simply come back point. i'm pretty sure glasses expensive worldwide.

i'm netherlands current glasses 500 eur. think specialized pair is, fitting pretty much perfectly one person one person only. else might cost like 10 bucks pharmacist Oh they're way past that, *love* Remdesivier. Considering COVID literally kill you, seems like quite risk think comes huge place privilege okay hindering Black American‚Äôs ability travel, historically, Black Americans unethically tested (by CDC). 

See: [Tuskgee Syphilis think Black Americans smart enough make decisions bodies, agree? Ask doctor work colleague recently died Covid contacting trip Mexico. wife sending constant update status. sounded horrific wouldn‚Äôt wish anyone. anti-vax people idea they‚Äôre store get severe case. Keep mind guy 45 years old pre-existing condition hypertension. 

Step step breakdown progression understand it. 

Started usual symptoms feeling flu-ish, began mild breathing problems went hospital, spent couple days like doctors monitoring him. Breathing issues began worsen given oxygen, eventually took experimental medication didn‚Äôt help also caused blood clot leg. condition worsened intubated, days later kidneys began fail put dialysis. put life support day later body shut drs couldn‚Äôt revive CPR. 

My uncle also passed away month ago basically progression able revive three times. third time dad made call stop trying dr said he‚Äôs basically going living life support major brain damage continue. wasn‚Äôt even anti-vax, lazy go it. mean, number kids suffering damn idiotic parents aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated! whole generation orphans didn‚Äôt happen. Smfh! Yes, different state state give children vaccinations. **Sep. 13, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Which messed up. sure combat mentality.  got sick recovered alpha variant via natural immunity. body fully succeptical Delta due antigenetic drift? 

Where mRNA vaccine provide protection via active binding sites unique virus lineage aka variants share characteristic?

I get *any parents*, reading article, prioritize FaceBook posts party affiliation children.  sure eligible? California‚Äôs population 39.5M. means 1/3 californians vaccinated. around 7 million kids 13 under. means there‚Äôs 5 million eligible population. means 26/32 = 80%+ eligible population least 1 dose. Yea still need cover rest 20%, compared missisipi, doesnt much population, relatively california much better.

But ya OP help encouraging people get vaxxed

Note: use 13 number thats stats find number kids california Yeah I‚Äôm sure places like am, NC, enforce vaccine mandates soon, already big corporations like Walmart. However, places like Texas Florida going harder governors don‚Äôt care. may tell something different show - hope not! told 3 made appointment, asked FluMist. live near Palm Springs vaccine rate low it‚Äôs Trump land, got mine wife got newborn, don‚Äôt go anywhere weekends, work can‚Äôt afford live one income son daycare it‚Äôs scary many don‚Äôt take seriously don‚Äôt know do.

Eventually, Pfizer Moderna could even different number shots series.

Unfortunately supposed littlest one came home school it. hypocritically post Facebook masks social distancing, pictures show masks kids eating birthday cake elbow elbow picnic tables.

Singapore tighter restrictions world despite one highest vaccination rates planet. (Six vaccinated individuals can't dine together? Really?) Even among elderly (depending define that), 70 75%, remainder presumably voluntarily choosing take it.

It's obvious Singapore's extremely low risk tolerance, rightly wrongly, huge factor maintaining restrictions. that's hope even mandatory vaccination would lead much (weren't two-thirds 80% original targets?). idea think thousands deaths materialize from, starting total death toll 58, mindset commonplace, Singapore long way go truly accepting COVID endemic.  need proven effective oral antivirus medicine approved available soon, likely end year.

That full length spike protein necessarily stabilized. binding requires lot mechanics. spikes expressed start closed conformation like others. regularly injecting people wild spike protein, can't say sure could even unfold attach receptors.

And even did, caring protecting others mandate called religion.

Or religion based selfish inflicting pain others.

What hypocritical piece shit reason get vaccinated.

Youre good person religious think using religion means keep harming others infecting covid thing.  üòÅ hope correct. I'm tired anti vax coworkers. It‚Äôs pretty state people are‚Ä¶different anyone clarify exactly anti-vaxers concerned about, death, stillbirths, sick small kids, devastated economy, shit show lives become.....are happy content things way? gotta say nonplussed behavior. political? Religious? Mass stupidity? Percentage, then. hope written pollyanna. Well, don‚Äôt know families, 2-4 group, daughter 2 cousins also 2-4; parents going get kids vaccinated soon available. bad wasn‚Äôt news group article. Yep. Several countries South America record cases low too. Mostly vaccination + previous natural infection. don‚Äôt want get shot beliefs ‚Äî sure whatever. kids‚Ä¶you taking shot them. two sides gish-gallop misinformation. grab bad information run it, simply overwhelmed give up. disagree here. rise delta, FDA approval, recent pressures nice spike vaccinations. vast majority people follow get second shot well. state (Maryland great vaccination record) difference first second shot 1.2%, nearly recent first shot people. That‚Äôs really good tip. Thank you. testing opt-out healthcare providers understand. mandate? Allowing anyone want one get tested week toothless. reading article, would disagree. OP‚Äôs experience seems unpleasant extreme, I‚Äôm okay giving *another* year experiences order save days potential unpleasantness. 

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, would participate public gatherings even knew sure would experience breakthrough infection. don‚Äôt believe cost avoiding breakthrough infections worth longer. never life insurance :( hope become little normal man, anxiety skyrocket since damn virus believe comment reference diversion resources attention.  hedged over... 'You've got freedoms, got keep freedoms'. Giving everyone wants one helpful.

Also guarantee never says again, booed supporters probably biggest hit ego ever taken. It‚Äôs frustrating, look mess last year one would believe vaccine imminent made plans... vaccine zero plans roll out, state federal level. People need prepared. definitely want real date, keep mind says end October likely end October.  law says healthcare providers health authorities lab charge max. 48 EUR PCR-test. I‚Äôm young, I‚Äôm old either. Unvaccinated people age group rarely dying. Two shots eliminated nearly deaths 60 neck woods.

Make three things.  contagious, drain society. reason smokers higher premiums non-smokers. public private corporations must strict UNVACCINATED people help stop spread deadly virus COVID-19 variants. Lots lots unvaccinated people ended intensive care units dead. insane people would that. company informal poll many, many employees across globe heard ton guffawing it. I'm taking less wild guess we'll mandated get vaccinated I'm curious many blowhards walk away.

Having family that's sick variety fun conditions Covid, tend trust doctors/science kind stuff I've seen quality life improve 30 fold kind stuff. Even hadn't, I'm sure shit throwing away career pay it. rise Columbia?  vaccinated right? another person's status affect effectiveness vaccine?

(Simply asking due vaccinated indicated people possible carriers virus)  really want open box? Anyone participates sports outdoor activities another premium added well. There's 7 billion people world. 110 million doses drop ocean. Vaccine donations going solve this. need open source vaccines get factories India, Bangladesh South America pumping millions doses per day. even them, give away conventional type vaccines keep hoarding mRNA ones want.

Now time protecting big pharma profits.  someone get guy haircut?  would deadly spread far. Look Ebola MERS, deadly, relatively rare epidemic/pandemic threat.

COVID especially deadly sweet spot infectiousness deadliness. deadly enough gets limited spread infectious enough spread around quickly. know people land hospitals people immunocompromised way another (obesity, illnesses, etc.). 

Just whatever lower risk. Vaccines help lot course, they're bandaid measure. overweight, drop weight. Eat healthy food. Exercise. Sleep well. Give immune system head start.  Thanks recommendation. listen two episodes last night excellent.

With delta variant infectious, quite possible we'll need booster shoots and/or infection-gained immunity addition regular vaccine schedule pandemic over. Perhaps annual vaccine well Covid becomes endemic. 

My concern claims natural immunity superior edges territory anti-vaxx rhetoric. (I'm also convinced actually true, like said, lot nuances comparison.) easily imagine vaccine-hesitant individuals using claim argument avoid vaccination embrace possibility exposure instead (e.g. ""why would get vaccine natural immunity better?"") claim they've already exposed therefore need vaccinated they're already protected. 

The latter common argument vaccination hear native Bulgaria (the least vaccinated country EU). Everyone vaguely claims already Covid-19, even never experienced characteristic symptoms, claim already protected. course, even true, vaccination would improve immunity, everyone interested kinds subtleties. claim natural immunity superior could easily become rallying cry many anti-vaxxers starts circulate general public, claim worth scrutinizing carefully. honestly insane much misinformation driven country divide public health crisis affecting ENTIRE GLOBE. I'm sick seeing ""The Democrats make virus last forever agenda Bill Gates and..""

Given limited supply, even complete information handled Alpha, still would went 2dose series imo. think wrong decision, decision made lack information sake getting vaccines fast possible, limited testing various dosing scheduling. Ohio get many **free** rapid tests want public library. students school continuing push mandatory testing regardless vax status, keep mind vaccine mandate ~99% vaccinated, mask requirement. Yesterday posted mandatory testing, know severity cases reported (as vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent infection reduces severity cases), got downvoted that. We‚Äôve heard long time important metrics post-vaccination hospitalizations deaths, raw cases. yet another post testing today, someone got downvoted oblivion suggesting vaccine largely prevents serious outcomes, longer major threat vaccinated. response people saying like still don‚Äôt want spread family, etc, even vaccine, go around spreading virus could stay home? question that‚Äôs asked many times is, vaccine can‚Äôt get us back normal life, will? always accept certain level risk lives.

I guess point tho, covid situation really bad rn Delta variant, hospitals getting overwhelmed parts country, there‚Äôs still need vigilance. However, almost seems like totally negated point vaccine acting like it‚Äôs March 2020. add, following restrictions closely since virus hit, got vaccinated soon can, 100% support vaccine mandates get us back normal.

Honestly I‚Äôm afraid people get us back remote again. Mandatory testing probably produce lot cases, point vaccine prevent infection. I‚Äôm afraid admin/professors freak high case count, prematurely go remote.  *Nobody* coerces Andy helping society. even cost helping family.

Western countries US specifically exporting hundreds millions doses. Moderna tried Beta specific boosters slightly effective another shot original. difference small decided worth use updated version vaccine. think Delta, confusion last time discussed someone.

Just sayin' .... Probably decent amount. Using NYC example, Bronx one hardest hit areas covid, lowest vaccination rate. Natural immunity explanation Delta wasn‚Äôt big deal here. Nothing ethical whore. like people slide ethics around ""feel good"" reasons. can't trust them. all. complete nonsense? I'm sure following post. I'm saying people appealing religion justify refusing vaccines insulting religion, justify appeal.

Why, racism nationalism, tolls countless tens millions slaughtered since 1800, ideological heirs religion world historical portfolio man's inhumanity man. insist.  anyone explain treatments are? 

If spectre long covid solved research (eventually), treatment vaccine good job keeping people hospital (with boosters needed), that's pandemic would end personally (of course I'd still wear masks needed, etc.). parent two kids 5, mentally exhausted messaging... dangerous, get vaccinated asap, unvaccinated definitely going catch it... give tools protect kids another 6 months. meantime, come back office even though job done well home. covid chance making immune system attack things need, case, Ace2 enzyme. covid triggers immune response, immune response goes hard ends creating autoantibodies attack ace2 enzyme. long covid might auto immune disorder caused sars2 infection.

I‚Äôm vaxxed, kid, emergencies right can‚Äôt get treated. Scary. Covid makes antibodies, specific antibodies make harder certain thing job, allows something else increase, leaving constant inflammatory state. I'm exact - I've number times 6-12 hours feeling like cold, fine. spleen, get cold messes lungs least week, sometimes much 3 months. None times lung problems.

Then, last week got sick stayed sick, rest family. tested negative covid, like normal, days later started breathing problems. reinforces probably covid least since times. can't 10s think. pediatrician can. Hopefully make exception covid vaccines.  covid results antibodies bind ACE2, leaving less ACE2 free thing body. Without necessary ACE2 would normally need place balance Ang II (which ACE2 would convert something else), end inflammation body potentially leading long covid. 

That probably help much, here's shorter version: system body related controlling blood pressure bodily function via ACE2/AngII. covid created antibodies mess system, leading inflammation potentially long covid.

I'm expert someone feel free correct me. really really hesitant covid zero long (I‚Äôm 100% sure we‚Äôre page *think* are.)

But work place 900k visitors per year, many unmasked young kids, far many mask-removing adults.

If took test positive result would Much careful. N95 instead multi layer cloth mask, leave building eat outside, desperately try get permission work home part week on. Update medical directives, depressing is.

If parents positive, I‚Äôd grocery runs, rescheduling doc appointments first patient in, etc.

Re: herd immunity. Delta appeared would likely right. delta spreading regardless vaccine/natural immunity regardless. beast virus. HIV kill fast. Especially now.

So answer original question: maybe? probably without changing rest characteristics. COVID outlier since long asymptomatic transmission period, compared viruses? Lol, there's nothing wrong wanting work study comfort home people may secretly relieved. Socially there‚Äôs pressure object, may glad excuse relent. refuse believe point pandemic uninformed.

Exactly. arbitrary it‚Äôs even worse kids cluster less 3 ft apart. antibody- resistant, could recently- recovered delta survivors potentially catch mu also? 

The concern that, one known variant that's antibody- resistant, may others, might become virulent, fatal younger individuals (especially re-infection cases), could render existing vaccines virtually completely ineffective, necessitating boosters new vaccines. long covid happens in, say, 10% unvaccinated people, vaccines essentially cut number half.

So it‚Äôs actually *substantially* less likely, fwiw.  That's donations, exports. US exported fraction EU China Columbia. continually, day, every day. random people media, political leaders, even science/medical leaders. People fail draw distinction vaccinated unvaccinated risk vaccinated people ""can"" spread virus.

I reading article UFO's government documents released earlier year. One article said people disappointed actual evidence aliens documents ""can't rule out"".

The CDC evidence vaccinated people become infected spread virus, ""can't rule out"".

Hmmm... people comment section don‚Äôt sound different ivermectin crowd. Covid-21 get everyone get vaccinated, would see uprise variant delta? I‚Äôm wondering that‚Äôd create new huge wave this. Totally agree

My point given everyone get though (at least vaccinated people might not) people work medical field faith medicine. Thats like programmer doesn‚Äôt believe math.  Yes, see magical change spike protines anything gets less deadly spreeds viruses do. ifs without evidence useless dangerous. news keeps pushing variants dangerous, sells clicks. children vaccinated . already 70% vaccinated 94% vulnerable. rest, thier problem now. sure. variant escape previous immunity edge people immunity.

These stats reinforced numbers released CDC, Israel, certain states Oklahoma Virginia, etc. track breakthrough infections.  really hope so.  Oh totally. know Gamble said want mandates, earlier year Delta obviously still running show. language sound strong though, can't imagine y'all's leadership make much stink, especially since federal requirement link that? personal circle friends LOT cases that.

Please God let case list accurate. counts Auckland lockdown 12 August 2020 7 October 2020. actually lockdown 12 August 30 August. Auckland Level 2 7 October Level 2 even close lockdown. Everything open, masks even required, work home stay home requirements, full travel freedom. relaxed standard level restrictions much Europe US now. 

So 199 days really incorrect. Auckland actually 107 days true lockdown today, minimum 22 go current lockdown. say respectfully. Almost 2 years ago meant quarantine order eliminate virus. commit quarantine, everywhere earth played different rules elimination became impossible started pretending elimination never goal. instead suppression control virus, stay isolated adopt protective measures, without official support without mandates ensure actually happens. Instead ""personal responsibility"" knowing it.

I'm complaining calls isolation protective measures, necessary public health everyone done things would better. cost this, lack social connection bad exercising. Plus hard exercise tiny apartment. single start pandemic following guidelines means still single much alone alone 18 months. 

Summer 2020 saw reductions cases people started ""returning normal"" states went advice control disease. Then, predictably autumn-winter devastation happened hundreds thousands died short period time. restrictions put back places, countries went back quarantine, entire regions totally full hospitals seemed like things going keep getting worse. 

Then vaccines came rollout faster expected still took months months. prematurely people got vaccine told could return normal, weeks later told return normal virus (predictably) changed several steps back were. talking boosters world still even vaccinated, talking vaccine hesitancy half people US decided want pandemic control enough acute phase end, seems like things still get worse get better.

Media health professionals much touted 90+% efficacy death, people thought vaccine would mean safe. long covid happen people even asymptomatic, Delta cut half ability prevent asymptomatic infection based early sparse data. Protective measures protect community rather yourself, knowing covid potentially vector means still isolating taking measures despite vaccine.

People upset unhappy getting yo-yoed around, public messaging changing over. inconsistent ever changing official guidance, rules, laws. Many people done everything supposed despite significant mental emotional cost so, repeatedly told would help end pandemic get things good place. things getting worse, follow rules pretending everything since may 2020. unless get severe covid long covid lives actually better it.

So yes, want vaccine real tool control over, protect completely stop making daily sacrifices. course do. human. asked lot people last 18 months, given anything return. ones given they've asked suffered ignored call. want something stable want something control over. feel incredibly helpless. would challenge mechanism effect. enough say ""We know."" also know moon crash earth, someone's going worry happening, probably able say what's going cause it.

In H√† N·ªôi, T·ªëng Vi·ªát D≈©ng, deputy director Urban Industrial Environment 13 Joint Stock Company, said company provided enough protective equipment environmental workers ensure safety. 
 
The company also constantly disseminated regulations pandemic prevention control, said. 
 
L√™ Th·ªã Linh, environmental worker company, said always equipped protective clothing job. Linh added already received one dose COVID-19 vaccine. 
 
In HCM City, Hu·ª≥nh Minh Nh·ª±t, director HCM City Urban Environment Company Limited, said company equipped personal protective equipment also instructed environmental workers obey regulations anti-pandemic prevention location collect waste. 
 
The company allocated 300 environmental workers collect waste lockdown areas three shifts daily, said. 
 
The environmental workers work hard ensure waste would transported treatment areas order minimise risk cross infection lockdown areas, said. 
 
However, amount waste large collection sites far away other, put great pressure environmental workers, said. 
 
Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªÅn, chairman Board Directors B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Water Supply Sewerage Environment Ltd., said company‚Äôs waste treatment branch 800 employees. 
 
Thi·ªÅn said waste transported company would treated specialised machines automatic disinfecting burning system. 
 
The dangerous stage workers collect waste lockdown quarantined areas, added. Therefore, company provided protective clothing environmental workers ensure safety waste collection. 
 
The company also periodically conducted COVID tests environmental workers. 
 
The company applied ""three on-site"" model, involves eating, sleeping, working without leaving aims keep operation production going meeting COVID-19 control prevention measures. 
 
Under model, company arranges accommodation environmental workers company. accommodation disinfected three times daily ensure safety. 
 
Ph√πng Ch√≠ S·ªπ, director Environmental Technology Centre, said environmental workers directly collected waste areas COVID-19 patients lived treated, played important role controlling preventing spread pandemic. 
 
So, needed classified frontline group given priority vaccination, said. 
 
S·ªπ also said waste areas cases COVID-19 infection well lockdown quarantined areas carefully sorted reduce pressure environmental workers treatment plants. 
 
Nguy·ªÖn Th∆∞·ª£ng Hi·ªÅn, deputy head Vi·ªát Nam Environment Administration Ministry Natural Resources Environment, said environmental workers collect transport waste daily. 
 
They very-high risk group COVID-19 infection, said. 
 
Therefore, ministry already proposed Government environmental workers given priority vaccination well regular tests ensure safety. 
 
More waste discharged 
 
In H√† N·ªôi, total amount waste increased 30 per cent, equal 7.5 tonnes per day, compared pre-pandemic levels. 
 
The company sharply increased frequency waste collection quarantined lockdown areas. 
 
The company‚Äôs waste treatment factory operates eight hours daily instead five before. waste transported factory treatment following route avoids going residential areas minimise spread pandemic. 
 
In HCM City, local Natural Resources Environment Department said amount waste discharged field hospitals quarantined areas 78 tonnes daily. 
 
In B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province, amount waste discharged field hospitals quarantined areas 70 tonnes daily. 
 
In response situation, environment ministry cooperated Ministry Health issue technical guidelines instruct localities treat waste related SARS-CoV-2 right pandemic hit country. waste treated hazardous. 
 
In July, ministry continued sending document 4119/BTNMT-TCMT ask localities nationwide strengthen measures deal waste related COVID-19.

""Idk safe"" (yet trials started year ago there's millions vaxxed) ""I'm young die COVID"", etc, etc. tiring. People interact high risk people also getting boosters. countries tests paid tax payers instead consumers.  H√Ä N·ªòI ‚Äî Ministry Health held online training conference Monday project enhance supply use medical oxygen facilities treating COVID-19 patients. 
 
The conference saw participation 1,000 locations 63 provinces cities.  
 
The conference aims prepare, respond proactively, promptly effectively terms medical oxygen emergencies treatment COVID-19 patients. 
 
Speaking conference, Deputy Minister Health Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Thu·∫•n emphasised investing medical oxygen supply system would investment long term.  
 
""The investment, expansion production scale, supply network technical infrastructure medical oxygen medical examination treatment facilities COVID-19 pandemic also future,"" said. 
 
In southern provinces cities, number new cases COVID-19 along current number cases need medical treatment diseases resulted increasing demand medical oxygen. percentage COVID-19 patients need oxygen ranging mild levels oxygen masks, oxygen therapy glasses high flow oxygen severe levels non-invasive invasive ventilation, ECMO, accounting 9.5 per cent total cases. 
 
According Nguy·ªÖn Minh Tu·∫•n, Director Department Medical Equipment Construction, Ministry Health, Vi·ªát Nam, supply capacity oxygen across country 1,200 tonnes liquid oxygen per day increased 50 per cent 100 per cent needed.  
 
Regarding status medical oxygen technical infrastructure medical facilities, basically meets routine medical care, still limitations number COVID-19 patients increases.  
 
In fact, many medical facilities district level central oxygen system; lack oxygen containers (such bottles, flasks, tanks); back number containers rotated, used support home treatment emergency transportation. Establishments remote areas often difficulty accessing oxygen supplies, ability coordinate mobilise oxygen prompt intensive situations like natural disasters (storms, floods, power outages, etc.) pandemic.  
 
To increase production, supply ensure medical oxygen treatment COVID-19 patients, September 7, 2021, Minister Health issued Decision No. 4308/QD-BYT strengthening capacity supply medical oxygen facilities treating COVID-19 patients. main objective project guide localities proactively develop plans organise close connection supply demand order exploit resources producing medical oxygen country; prepare medical oxygen infrastructure treat COVID-19 patients according different pandemic scenarios. 
 
Deputy Minister Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Thu·∫•n pointed four groups solutions provinces cities need conduct urgently. 
 
First, reviewing evaluating current status medical oxygen technical infrastructure medical facilities levels developing plan, based guidance Ministry Health medical oxygen demand levels, improve technical infrastructure medical oxygen systems facilities treating COVID-19 patients. 
 
Secondly, localities assess ability produce oxygen, network oxygen suppliers, plan expand scale oxygen production supply ensure demand met. 
 
Thirdly, provinces cities implement effective connection coordination among stakeholders: producers, suppliers, transporters users oxygen ensure emergency needs met without interruption various situations.  
 
The deputy minister requested localities assign vice chairman people's committees head department, leader Department Health acting deputy permanent member unit charge medical oxygen coordination. Localities also strengthen application management coordination medical oxygen, time properly control price medical oxygen locality ensure price barrier demand oxygen increases. 
 
Localities asked continue implement motto ""four spot"", proactively prepare, ready promptly respond medical oxygen needs emergencies COVID-19 treatment: planning procurement medical oxygen containers necessary supplies equipment; simultaneously, continuously expanding training doctors, nurses, medical staff levels medical oxygen therapies treatment suitable levels. ‚Äî VNS that's Binax test, aware tests 36h series considered ""one"" test. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

 we'll never fade away   said incredibly well. right, many done everything asked tired yo-yo, refuse anything seemingly rewarded behaviour (and/or behaviour causing us take three steps back every one step forward). People given lot want answer give light end tunnel. Vaccines played way.

I also think pandemic highlighted media public can‚Äôt hear certain statistics trusted understand them. 90%+ efficacy example mRNA vaccines also wide ranging confidence interval, tested optimum conditions low-transmission time without variants. feel honest limitations leads people distrusting vaccine (calling ‚Äúleaky vaccine‚Äù, pointing breakthroughs). Instead messaging could it‚Äôs perfect, vaccines are, it‚Äôs one thing many things need move forward protect selves others.  Oh, that‚Äôs preexisting conditions.

Well that's true, polio high rate mutation. introduced major campaign vaccinate everyone short order, we've done quite lot disseminate vaccines everywhere.

Hi, unvaccinated persons touching newborn infant, please. 80% effectiveness what? Detectible infection symptomatic infection? Idk, fact is, article click bait fuck, read it, vitro data. don‚Äôt vivo, claim antibody evasion can‚Äôt truly estimated till actual human data. also dismissed Mayo Clinic study wide CI, however IMO true value near upper end CI severe disease *still* justifies booster, also made mention several different data sources also got numbers 80-90% severe disease July, recent CDC cited study larger dropoff elderly showing severe disease effectiveness 70s.

They also make dubious argument know long additional protection last, might short. That's likely good reason.

They cite ethical argument without quantifying benefit; single additional shot 100m elderly high risk Americans mere 1 month current production levels Pfizer Moderna alone, assuming announced targets schedule. That's massive benefit globe justifying harm here.

Tl;dr letter inappropriately dismisses ignores science justifying booster motivated reasoning justify perception ethical position. know think going accomplish. Holy, meant? reach communities color low % vaccinated?

I live predominately Spanish-speaking neighborhood NYC. Something like half people born outside US. relatively low-income community, kind insular. neighborhood also features lowest vaccination rates Manhattan.

A times past weeks I've noticed giant vaccination bus parked major street said neighborhood (with attendant ""post-vaccination monitoring"" bus right behind it). time saw it, long lines people patiently waiting get shot. evident tons people walking impulsively decided get vaccinated. Spanish-speaking nurses surely helped.

What tells communities, way reach is: actually try reach them. Bring vaccine right them. Speak language. Make vaccination *easy*. Make clear free. help people actively anti-vaccine, communities like neighborhood, help make little extra effort. Reinforced already believed I‚Äôve doing. 

Vaccinated status doesn‚Äôt mean forgo masks, social distancing, definitely means won‚Äôt traveling 

I wait. It‚Äôs worth me. 100% empty stands  Hello, nice meet you. enough ‚Äúin vivo‚Äù need scientific based double blind study accurately say, antibody escape. fact scientific data. article vitro. vitro data also caused issues ppl thinking ivermectin works Covid get vivo data, showed didn‚Äôt. that‚Äôs vivo data works Good thing antivaxxers keeping Delta going? people would go CDC's website info, they'd find recommend folks moderately severely immunocompromised. Also, science change. dense obtuse critical institutions change minds. incredibly GOOD thing this! want give us informed recommendations. 
they cite CDC data reasons, arguably good.

 
here, lets take look CDC data tells us:

  
oh, tells us CDC tells vaccine reduces risk hospitalization 10X!!!! actually reduces chance infected 5x, end infected, merely reduces chance hospitalization 2x.  65, risk hospitalization INFECTED goes 20% 10%. real, verified everywhere data available.

 
these data rapists simply inflating protection severe disease justify letting grandma die save people we're probably going drone strike eventually anyways.

 
these experts obviously HATE Americans, especially elderly. they've decided want increase chance infected, therefor probability ending severe disease, want save third world. parents PCR 14 days original PCR? assume you‚Äôre UK, guidance another PCR 90 days (unless showing new symptoms). due sensitivity test still showing virus shed, even longer contagious. entire US economy greatly influenced insurance. Capitalism maximizing profit. Actuarial methods don‚Äôt care politics, religion, etc. end, it‚Äôs numbers game. BTW, stay away sports book folks, see economic slaughter coming. yes, please move upwards sake. know what's store stay put alternative significantly better life qualitatively speaking. date article February. data indicates protection wanes significantly. Isn‚Äôt worth noting even get vaccine aren‚Äôt fully immunized weeks also contributing variants. People always find minority hate on, isn‚Äôt whole picture. 

If people actually isolated bit got vaccinated it‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt able adapt fast. Babies would good cause. put dime? No, true. case NZ example gives number days lockdown regions outside Auckland. count include time rest NZ Level 2. rest NZ Level 2 12 August 21 September 2020 still Level 2 right now. none counted lockdown. list clearly inconsistent. can't count Level 2 lockdown Auckland, rest NZ. 

The list says Massachusetts 41 days lockdown, exiting 4 May 2020. time full stay home order place include months afterwards indoor capacity limits, mask mandates closed schools stricter NZ Level 2. counted lockdown Massachusetts, counted Auckland? 

The list totally inconsistent comparing jurisdictions. count jurisdictions even within NZ lockdown stay home order place. count Queensland South Australia lockdowns right either, capacity limits mask mandates place stricter NZ Level 2. Confronted assurances, I'll bow head shame. little could find incubation period normally 4-14 days, 45 days showing symptoms. mutates bit towards 45 days variant super lethal, problematic. likely not, due viruses spread. Typically systemic respiratory vaccines provide little protection nasal viral shedding, requires mucosal IgA response - vaccines generate. 

This core problem, also Delta got popular. Vaccinated carry spread virus nasally, get significantly sick part. variants replicate aggressively means vaccinated difficulty spreading. Florida seems turn last major wave. timing seems fairly consistent experienced last year. Here‚Äôs hoping things better us state going forward. feel like they're weighing logistics perceptive impact protection.

I challenge assumption. efficacy pediatric trials based antibody studies, real world infection rates like adult trials. quite reasonably results weeks.  Yes, love God people need stop making fear inducing headlines try stop making people damn afraid variants. It‚Äôs kind shit bring vaccine hesitancy vaccine skepticism lot things. ""data rapists"" gave chuckle. crass vividly descriptive phrase. Everyone needs star personal saga, everyone else see.

Good grief. evades antibodies, matter Delta rapidly spreading? Mu still infect persons before, during, Delta infection.  problem. hope things better since then? mask: check.
Entitled finger wagging: check.
Aggressive body language: check.
Arguments make sense: check.
Incoherent screaming: check. need emphasize - 26% unvaccinated minority. get much detail. male employee threaten another person work female something small. said quote ""I hope something bad happens fucking children"" know happend spoke 6 years ago this? got trouble. sign zero tolerance policy form, got moved another area I. got punished overhearing it. understand completely saying. trust I've always tried advocate others. could be, governor confident know Dr. Fauci scam... /s they're symptoms they're going spreading high risk people, mission accomplished.

Those high risk individuals vaccinated though, Canada 90% people aged 70 vaccinated, 80% people 50 up: get vaccination coverage among younger people, longer becomes threat. need get hospitals overwhelmed unvaccinated.

An 85% reduction real world risk phenomenal, drive coverage rate higher certainly ""mission accomplished""  zero bearing whether likely incur higher medical expenses though. We're talking individual insurance rates here, society at-large. think big difference. Ivermectin simply proven anything help COVID-19 infection. hand, available data shown booster shots increase protection getting infected virus. research publication dispute argue since protection severe disease still good, boosters needed. Anecdotally many people (myself included) know fully vaccinated people got breakthrough infection ""mild"" far people would describe many cases suffer long covid. believe understandable want go similar experience would want option boost immunity ""mild"" infection, even short term. Researches completely ignoring long term effects breakthrough infections help. waste-water monitoring basically like group test whole community. take sewer water, test covid know quickly people upstream covid Agree. I've following numbers since beginning thing US exceptionally well considering become political.

Here's breakdown age group (from 9/12)

|Age Group|% least one dose|
|:-|:-|
|12 15|51.8%|
|16 17|59.8%|
|18 29|60.3%|
|30 39|67.9%|
|40 49|73.7%|
|50 64|81.6%|
|65 74|95.1%|
|75 older|89.8%| think ok someone get vaccine get sick take bed hospital promised surgery patient 3 weeks ago ,not patient 6 10 patients lost bed stupid idiot decided get vaccine got sick maybe die 3 weeks so, math . part cure, problem period !!!!!  Really, almost like implemented measures vaccines (both government ordered, precautions taken individuals) order control situation. people dumb holy cow. elaborate waste water monitoring?

Some municipal waste water systems regularly sample wastewater streams evidence COVID (and probably diseases). part surveillance. One example [MWRA](http://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm). spikes July/August probably caused Delta variant. getting ""slightly"" better past weeks, at, else go Covid crossed animals (but significant mutations noted). would assume (And clearly state *no* expertise) significant mutations crossing zoonotic barriers could mean can't cross back humans.

But importantly population density. humans far, far largest social species mingles dense populations (And carries covid, let's talk ants). Every transmission offers opportunities mutations certainly still contractable humans. 

Unless wanna talk animal vaccines covid. important thing still convincing people get vaccinated. Everything else secondary. Even every mutation small minute chance see breakthrough mutations (breakthrough vaccine).

Again state lack expertise. feel free correct me. imagine. want work dirty people.  [archive link anyone trouble accessing article appreciate R0 1, means exponential growth. Reducing even factor 100 vaccinated population still leaves 13 million unvaccinated UK 80% vaccination, 65 million unvaccinated US rate. numbers unvaccinated enough overwhelm hospital systems. 

The reasons spread going full speed populations restrictions safety measures(both government imposed, ones people take themselves)

If measures drop off, rip unvaccinated population mere months overwhelm system. wouldnt make sense caught somewhere else 14 days quarantine over? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, .... reason viruses spread presymptomatically. time contagious, ill - ill, mixing society many opportunities pass virus. extreme example Ebola, get ill quickly transmission limited. obviously there's normally evolutionary pressure viruses make ill, increases opportunities passed on.

However, Coronavirus avoids transmissible presymptomatic phase. time get symptoms fall ill, virus done spreading, there's longer evolutionary pressure towards less severe disease. Username checks article cited state official saying wasn‚Äôt shortage. get federal rep say wasn‚Äôt read. reason think would be. Good question, interesting enough opposite affect thought. ACE converts angiotensinogen angiotensin (which binds specific receptors increase blood pressure) idea blocking action logical think would protect patients hypertension caused disease. found actually opposite.

ACE2 responsible breaking angiotensin, longer active, thus longer increasing BP. there's Angiotensin bind, leaves many free infected viruses. found using ACE inhibitors specifically covid treatment bad idea cus sped infection process. 

That said, different take regularly control existing hypertension. never good idea go meds, even case disease help compensate bit, receptor profile different healthy patient got hospitalized. go them, blood pressure would raise would double affect disease. case polycystic kidney disease would put higher risk, likely meds. something physicians take account treating covid patients.  Deaths death reporting, lag infections hospital admittances. fallout recent spike. believe New Mexico got wall using. Anecdotal evidence far suggests less transmissable. Given majority transmission happening among unvaxxed, makes sense leading strain would transmissable. got ant-vaxxers vax up, mu might become dominant, many people would vaxxed likely much less concern. Delta around long time, staying goods deadly. Little thinks he's Moron Whisperer, he's actually part crowd. Never going opportunity like again. many stupid people destroying careers nothing, let pass by. Good luck. Yup. mom quadruple bypass surgery fall 2019 (age 48). spent entirety 2020 early mid 2021 worried death would happen caught COVID. fully vaxxed too, relief.  Deep there's fear COVID, certain circles anti-vaxx gives bravado / street cred. think lots people relieved get vaxx blame employer / government secretly relieved safer now.

In fact know people admitted much me. Viruses evolve like that. Viruses mutate randomly.  sure did, another poor picked upon monster wanted force everyone live way wants, ‚Äúwhatabout Biden Marshall law 30 days in‚Äù doesn‚Äôt happen ‚Äúwhatabout take guns‚Äù doesn‚Äôt happen‚Ä¶.. although keep yall queda shit may taken away they‚Äôre felons lol Sterilizing?

Oh God comment made see red.  like one

""An individual's freedom refuse vaccine nothing compared humanity's freedom live without threat eternal plague"" Say attack things body, always competition things attack thing 80% coverage nearly enough herd immunity Delta, that's quite literally point article. Doctors saying since started getting details Delta transmissibility. Maybe 95% would be, 80 means 1 5 people unvaccinated leaves plenty pathways. mention fact Delta happy infect spread vaccinated people reasonably high numbers too. wish way communicate anti maskers *Proceeds hyperventilate uncontrollably* viruses' perspective, matter person gets sick not: whether infect spread (symptoms like coughing sneezing method spread, seems covid spreads fine breathing necessarily need method spreading). controlled studies regular testing provide good evidence this. 5-6 months, seems Pfizer even reduce risk infection half even less preventing transmission. virus's perspective, people little immunity. Delta (a highly transmissible variant little immune escape) going spread much Mu (a normally transmissible variant higher immune escape). 

&amp;#x200B;

Unrelated context conversation: they're symptoms they're going spreading high risk people, mission accomplished. people complain ones complained lockdowns.  I‚Äôm glad hear you‚Äôre getting help now. like world better :) Sounds like Alberta haha Yep. used CDC estimates calculation. arguing points I'm making. northeast ok, significant greatly reduced amount mostly vaccinated elderly people die.

And, referred orignal post, cases stay low there, low UK now, even almost identical vaccinate uptake say, New England. part breakthrough infections, fact clearly ""rare."" number children young adults hospitals (and ICUs) US contradicts assumption. 

Delta Alpha Original Strain comes younger demographics. Yeah well, soon kids get vaccine I'll considered social end reached, there's still risk I'm comfortable considered over. amazing numbers! 

why every article ridiculing US? I've straight deleted blocked simply asking questions this. I'm vaccinated wear mask everywhere go, also fully believe everything tell us Covid. second ask challenging question regarding vaccine, downvotes oblivion post removal. think everyone fearing much virus. usernames, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching weirdest David Attenborough documentary ever. rating world's #1 prepared pandemic 2019, pretty sad US CDC seemed way heads Covid, pioneered absolutely nothing responding virus. China, South Korea, countries quickly rolled lot creative effective techniques. mass testing drive-through testing centers. Pooled testing. China find cases somewhere test province millions people basically weekend. Politics root guidance policy requires this. Mu strain predominant Colombia last months. little Delta. US there's nothing stopping getting one. Whether immunocompromised honor system, vast majority pharmacies asking questions, extremely demanding kind proof. find frustrating, feels like significant disconnect scientific theory real world needs. Yes, vaccine intended protect serious disease death, stopping spread priority statistically spread even among vaccinated small percentage turns larger number people. mention, seeing immense burden healthcare systems.

IIRC, also FDA officials extremely u happy FDA asked hurry. shows much disconnect theFDA severity situation. think hospitalization percentage works way think does. ""if catch it, much less likely hospitalized""

It's ""if vaccinated, much less likely hospitalized someone unvaccinated""

Those quite distinct, first one assumes already caught it, later includes chances catching first place. 

If catch though (a breakthrough case) essentially likely hospitalized per case basis. hearing doctors travel nurses different states. buried one pregnant woman. far unvaccinated. Often leaving kids behind.  Cummerbund Bandersnatch think thinking rabies tends mutate much bc relatively hard get high lethality hosts spread it. per CDC 1960 2018 127 cases rabies humans US. Whereas rough 13 million ppl HIV US 2019 34800 new cases. HIV way transmissible. strains rabies associated animal vectors human specfic rabies virus. HIV-1 snd HIV-2 humans.


Flu Covid easy spread often dont kill hosts fast spread around quickly many hosts. public health stand point potential much dangerous impact population.

Let know im wrong that's mean. Cos may misinterpreting you. experience virus analogies. *bites arm clean off* Bill de Blasio New York remained resolute school year proceed normally, albeit safety measures place. still possible significant in-school transmission fall could force many school buildings ‚Äî even entire system, virus case numbers rise substantially ‚Äî shut schools saw remarkably low virus transmission buildings last year, schools significantly reduced capacity. Even transmission rate 0.03 percent end last year, quarantines still regular year, least level disruption inevitable, city‚Äôs newly announced quarantine policy almost certain lead frequent short-term classroom elementary schools, children still young vaccinated, one positive case classroom prompt 10-day quarantine, switch remote learning, entire middle high schools, unvaccinated students quarantine exposed someone virus, meaning unvaccinated students could much different school year vaccinated classmates. 60 percent New York City children eligible vaccine received least one dose, city know many children attend public city‚Äôs quarantine protocol conservative Centers Disease Control Prevention recommends, New York‚Äôs school testing plan modest C.D.C. calls for, alarming parents public health random sample 10 percent unvaccinated students tested school every week; city testing 20 percent people school buildings weekly end last year. Experts said city‚Äôs current testing plan almost certainly small scope stop many outbreaks York gone districts country implementing full vaccine mandate educators, along adults work school buildings. mayor said believes mandate, along increasing vaccination rates eligible students, help keep schools safe year last year. think problem is, forums (and real life) full people saying, ""You're crazy, covid flu, kids fine, get back work stop living fear!"" true helpful. comment sounds lot like that. intention, appreciate thought.  Someone something learnt Plague Inc. live college town see attending games, I‚Äôm trying feel upset events. I‚Äôve diligent throughout pandemic, pandora box. Maybe need like people going normal life. 
I‚Äôm still hesitant it, it‚Äôs choice‚Ä¶just like it‚Äôs go games. Indoor gatherings may likely causing spread‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know.

Anyway, musings.  ...care vulnerable/immunocompromised,..

Caring important. 

Still need point breeding vaccine resistant strains. Sure, make vaccines new strains everyone get multiple vaccines. think right force that?

Also need point everyone aging. Everyone eventually becomes immune compromised. life expectancy entire population drops strategy stopping epidemics. 

The anti-vaxxers irrational ignorant. USA spends 18% GDP health care. 9 weeks work per year. want callous let vulnerable suffer and/or die could eliminate spending. Something else occurring. Maybe take HR? fucking nightmare woman work ghouls. they're actually bordering harassment really need speak culture racism misogyny grow fester. Set example daughter. One thing would concerned if, since Delta transmissible, result, cases arise, masks longer worn significant percentages, could matter time Mu comes across someone delta, antigenic shift occurs wrong way delta transmissibility Mu antibody avoidance. It‚Äôs obviously complex whether happen, based high transmissibility mechanisms antibody avoidance mechanisms whether antagonistic nature eachother. ‚ÄúCheckmate, Covid! I‚Äôm already dead inside!‚Äù There's distinct difference there's widespread disagreement experts world class health agencies they're making ethical sociological arguments unsettled data, tiny fringe completely non-credible people conspiracy theories data false.

Antivaxxers thrive false equivalencies like this. Looking US vs UK reaction vaccines, UK voluntary apolitical vs US political starting forced...

I think vaccine passports counter productive fuel conspiracy theories.

I got NHS vaxx card ready need I'm vaccinated, way convince people.

Democrats need really tone virtue signalling, panic apparently giant parties (thanks Obama). 

Even Fox News appears pro vaxx Trump bragging vaccines last year, really seems like one side (Democrats) making vaccines political weapon.  Polio never spread way Coronavirus has, even original strain.

Vaccines enough kill form social distancing measures maintained. enter country traveling internationally. Idaho, Gov. Brad Little‚Äôs office said available interview, indicated recent weeks plans restore virus restrictions, **even hospitals entered dangerous territory**, saying wanted residents ‚Äúto choose right thing get vaccinated.‚Äù issued statement Friday saying exploring legal action halt mandate President Biden require millions people get vaccinated.

What. A. Tool.

At almost two years pandemic 40% vaccination rate - one going ""choose right thing"". I've heard anything COVID-19 crossing humans species, mutating, back humans. f seen report, please pass along link. IMO unless person died ongoing infection they're counted current estimates. Anything else would hard prove causal link vs pure chance genetics, etc. 

I read quote doctor one time I'm paraphrasing remember exactly, basically said ""if everyone came primary care doctor waved hand arm, nothing else wave hand let go, statistically know X% heart attack next year, Y% cancer, Z% have...and on. arm wave anything? There's many factors play really determine root cause especially age goes up. 

Bodies weird way unfortunately. healthy young adult get cancer? overweight smoker live 80? know lot medicine learned much last 100 years, going controversial, there's still lot know think general public overestimates capabilities modern medicine. Aldi Costco say hello. still mostly unvaccinated people getting sick, see stats above. That's unlikely. Delta's incubation time even shorter prior variants, ~3.7 days. Antibodies vaccinated people ramp much faster unvaccinated people, meaning virus get jump quickly, get sick.

The cases related. high-transmission area, people public spaces regularly, crazy several people get covid 1.5 months. even India. Europe seeing Delta surge time (UK especially) we're always 6 weeks behind them. 

The US tried PR exercise order try persuade anti-vaxxers get vaccine. ""Get vaccinated take mask!"" Psych 101 student could tell bonehead move.  vaccination rate high high enough. 62.7% population fully vaccinated.

For asking, still mostly unvaccinated people getting sick - per Governor's Facebook August 23rd ‚Äì August 29th, fully vaccinated individuals accounted for: 2,602 positive tests (Statewide Total: 12,051) 35 COVID-related hospitalizations (Statewide Total: 945) 0 COVID-related deaths (Statewide Total: 80)   defense rollback: there's huge overlap people chose get vaccinate never wearing masks first place. 
 
  
The group concern coming lying chose vaccinated still wearing mask anyway, I'm sure that's particularly sizable chunk people. might name djsjjs
The limited group people hang deal social limitations involved trying keep covid life. 

Pandemic pod???? Idunno! table titled ""Percent Vaccine Breakthrough Cases among Fully Vaccinated OK Residents"".

Yes, 0.42%, 1 238, 1 10,000.

And counts everyone got tested it, know everyone. also counts everyone fully vaccinated, recently fully vaccinated many opportunities contract covid breakthrough case. can‚Äôt vaccine resistant Delta level infectious time I'd say probably beneficial immunocompromised people get third shot since 2 doses probably worked well rest us. wonder though rest like fairly healthy young. stand corrected! going back point.

You can't fix stupid even Florida can't shoot it. 3 ""tests"". mentioned elsewhere thread, 2-pack 1 test. vaccinated timeframe emmit viruses shorten, longer. Delta hand seems increase virus amount. almost impossible tell got whom. seems possible though people infected different occassions. Hope get healthy asap. state (Maryland great vaccination record) difference first second shot 1.2%, nearly recent first shot people.

Maryland average vaccination record compared developed world. USA quite good, remarkable. 8/50?

I see 7% difference Maryland, similarly vaccinated states? missing something? gap existed throughout closing. Well, Oxhams Razor, cant sure, always consider easiest, probable option, which, Pandemic, Pcr test high prevalence covid next prevalence flu always covid... ""Covid pod"", may wrong. Yeah wouldn‚Äôt that, we‚Äôd eat cost. think she‚Äôs coming around going  think I'd pick cancer covid. good evidence support boosters general population time. 100% push vaccine companies. category 10% improvement meaningful (e.g. highly susceptible individuals) justify getting boost every 6 months, everyone else, protection provided memory cells durable sufficient, even variants. research needed regarding probably bad paranoid people assuming. Previously business ignored corona restrictions. warning several forcibly completely closed two week period. 

There cases businesses broke rules closed down, general enforcement seemingly working quite well far. Yeah dad actually got covid July mother massive emergency episode clots currently  Yup soon kids get end restrictions, except vaccine restrictions follow. version mine. want medical records decide me? take decide you? everloving fuck?

Sincerely, 

A Californian  came ask :D
As mum offered one today, next weeks thursday. know americans 3rd shot, here, germany even rare scenario. highest comittee vaccination (STIKO) yet recommended 3rd one, off-label-use, since works elderly home, initial immuniztion january, seems resonable take offer.

A friend mine immunocompromised, got 3rd one weeks ago didnt report severe reactions. Sooner later expect everyone getting 3rd shot anyways.   Personally I‚Äôd go, everyone‚Äôs risk tolerance different. wouldn‚Äôt blame didn‚Äôt want to. However, it‚Äôd pretty awful cancel kick girl still wants go. You‚Äôd suck still pay. Well, think need using boosters well donating - parents old immune compromised.

At point may well shift 30% southern states supplies vaccine outside US it‚Äôs needed desperately wanted expire. God knows antivaxxers kids state aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated time soon despite trend lines.

If said booster me, gave away overseas I‚Äôd deal, common comorbidity weight, mask take precautions can. Though work close contact 2-3,000 people per day, there‚Äôs much do.

But want vulnerable parents protected booster makes difference. adults vaccinated, means even get get severe disease. Even wore masks limited accomplish close many kids anyways. I'd never force kids wear mask entire schoolday one handful adults vaccinated anyway... That's bonkers. Hopefully that's actually trying argue lol believe big chains will. starbucks worked 100 employees singlestone certainly 100 locations country.  One thing keep mind...is average twitter user going make thread ""hey get breakthrough week"". thread like get retweets allows see it. 

twitter always amplifies unusual eventful. got j&amp;j april.
I‚Äôve direct exposure covid didn‚Äôt get sick test positive. It‚Äôs perfect vaccine it‚Äôs horrible everyone says. know, reality really strange thing sometimes... No, guys wear condoms either. highly speculative, possibility IMO excluded:

I surprised done bad player. Maybe even foreign intelligence sevice country looks like failed people veing compar Nee Zealand.  assuming fixed amount vaccines

This irks - discussions vaccine shortages seem focused around limiting use vaccines rather increasing ability manufacture more.  Monday always worst day reporting. best ignore single day numbers instead look average previous 7 days. states nurses 4 year degree get certified full registered nurse? Exactly. Mina point wrt rapid tests. They're public health tool intended slow transmission accurate diagnostic tool. also detect exactly person contagious essential stop transmission. news reports (detailed articles) 6 weeks. Supposedly rare, many young men complain chest pain. Well enjoy unemployed terminated well, terminated due something control (like budget cuts) due actions. look good prospective employer. agree. used like type subs, unfortunately, they've overran crazy conspiracy theorists.   kick someone covid pod bc refuses get vaxxed. time. Immunosuppressed people high risk people. great, god knows malpractice cracks conducted!!! investigation deaths held whilst individuals shift access patients. Personally I'm getting booster unvaccinated child school gets COVID want able separate rest family take care without worrying getting sick myself. agree fully. saying previous case rates aren‚Äôt factor. NYC one first areas businesses requiring things like proof negative tests well. countries would enough jabs themselves, yes. since receiving quantities...  look Portugal, 88% first dose recent infection 80% complete vaccination cases dropping fast restrictions slowly coming off. positive real world data Ivermectin. However, positive data Israel third doses. even prepping fourth doses future. Coming someone knows many people Florida, simply care. older people even minorities believe lies easily believe happening. Whoa that‚Äôs coolest possible graduate programs. May trouble book rec‚Äôs?  I'm saying people incorrectly blame capitalism say ""it's America"" defeatist way without trying identify root causes. problem overzealous regulations slowing innovation preventing competition lowering prices. Floridian would love Faucied  win  get vaccinated, even pregnant.

ESPECIALLY pregnant. antibodies get passed newborn, meaning least theory nominal resistance. Americans get 3 months maternity, there's good chance kid daycare 6 month mark (theoretically) could get vaccine. really want kill students? make Biden look bad? Good points!  Vaccine requirements better mask mandates. go crowded bar requires proof vaccine, I‚Äôm safe. go grocery store 90% people wearing shitty mask incorrectly, knows. 

I say someone got covid March wearing mask. NYC got hit hard winter despite mask use, thing helped vaccines vaccine requirements.   That‚Äôd ideal, perhaps poorer countries means storing mRNA vaccines? Patient zero??  Governor Grim Reaper This. I‚Äôm fucking getting booster way can. I‚Äôm sick death CDC FDA twiddling thumbs public health measures figure best messaging Facebook skeptics crowd. state peaked 40% vaxxed it‚Äôs going budge number. Right they‚Äôre tossing thousands jabs. feel like conversation needs change ""why vaccinated"" ""please make sure affairs order."" know anti-vaxxer life, next time start ranting, ask will, life insurance, end life wishes recorded. take care kids?  faced vent, want? disability insurance survive hospital weeks, unable work extensive periods, possibly never again? true ""personal responsibility"" looks like.  person can't face types questions actually ready COVID call bluff. lol.. doubt think that.  thankful utter idiot charge making call. Exactly. doesn‚Äôt seem nearly transmissible Delta thus never gain much ground. peaked July 2% positive tests, it‚Äôs well 1% :D missing important part polio attacked central nervous system. Fat unhealthy people always prone. Look Duke University they're like 98% vaxxed testing EVERYONE weekly. Last saw, majority breakthrough cases asymptomatic. long buys drinks first, whatever. 

Let's ride roller-coaster way down. Someone recently explained way. gone overboard sea many lifejackets go around. prioritize people yet receive one give people want replace slightly worn lifejackets?  


If both, great. no, better EVERYONE get first doses virgin populations consider boosters. wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs explanation, definitely explanation. Areas like NYC also pretty accepting mask wearing compared areas hit hard delta. officially recommended even authorized yet US. know married couple already gotten booster, one severely immune compromised. questions asked went pharmacy ask it. possible longer incubation period either due delta, vaccination status. string covid cases past 1.5 months circle, fully vaccinated. way related unusually long incubation period (14-21 days).  max 401k? Never heard HSA employer match. Even 6:1 401k employer match immediate 17% return. can't beat that. social media world work world two different extremes. I'm surrounded antivaxxers work, see tons calls go back full-on lockdown online. definitely empathetic latter group obviously extremes exhausting seem miss reality could stop hospitalizations even greater number deaths vaccinating every adult. worries! appreciate information, posted here. know missed something something planned future.

Now know FDA meeting Friday, make full decision then. keep news, get draining sometimes... Holy shit, 3-week-old baby still doesn‚Äôt name. 

That might one saddest things I‚Äôve ever read. law requiring it.

Congress could pass law today decided to, chooses to. Vaccine mandates instead coming workplace safety authority OSHA Department Labor, since migrants jobs (yet), covered. Jesus fuck people!!!!!

A coworker mine pregnant vaccinated (pregnant first, double jabbed) spoken Drs decided want catch covid pregnant! think made right choice!

She still pregnant, know unborn baby doing, seems ok, getting regular tests, see Simple answer I'll get get, I'll keep following research get choice I'll decide based latest data. supposed part mitigate risk. anti-vaxxer basically high-risk hobby now.   really Apparently answer [no, Reddit doesn‚Äôt care subreddits spread antivax fuckin guy Ii88 Thank kind thoughts. Four still struggling long-term effects, two actively sick, one heading hospital. Mu Eta? *Technical Report* points dated 1 Sep 2021, date formatting landing page poor choice. Reality policy slow general. always reactionary rather proactive US... See: climate change. Wish wasn't, :/

It's also worth noting CDC/FDA control executive branch... Take worth. Every time log onto Twitter see thread along lines ""I got supposedly-mild breakthrough case another vaccinated person miserably sick week, please careful."" Lack data makes difficult, reality seems majority breakthrough cases truly mild/asymptomatic. 

Considering 1. vaccinated 2. unmasked small groups vaccinated people still careful half US being, I'm afraid hearing awful breakthroughs making already-cautious afraid (""I'm gonna suffer matter what"") careless careless (""even vaccinated masked people get it, bother""). Oh I‚Äôm trying influence decision it‚Äôs medical care team pointing think don‚Äôt absolute FDA yet. Exactly. Afaik effect booster shots fully vaccinated individuals belong risk group less completely negligble, significantly help beyond preventing mildest cases learned playing Plague Inc. 8877‚Å∑I 8777688 remember getting vaccine production current levels quickly took Manhattan Project level work, especially mRNA vaccines. USA European countries vaccine spare, countries still short. 

An updated Covid vaccine would *substantially* better current version worth shutting production lines switch new vaccine. Unpopular opinion - try protect refuse effective tool have. can't isolate prevent walking around freely?

Say someone radioactively contaminated bathing/drinking pipeline supplied evil corporation dumps toxic wastes water system. knowingly (or refuse accept fact contaminated) go public, spreading contamination. public threat? get whatever want name ""freedom""? think case people hazmat suits would escort said person facility longer threat public health standpoint.

Where draw line public threat vs selfishness? thing make possibly think less dumb little delta

It dumb people lie, EVERYONE stopped wearing masks. dumb national RealID compliant vaccine credential. dumb ask $12/hr grocery workers enforce mask policies let sworn police officers decide laws enforce not. Hey thanks article!

We still week cancel appointment. guess I'll see general consensus Friday FDA meets go there.  Saying anything tragic still understatement.

Neither one people old 'compromised' claim that's reason they've died coronavirus.

As much part hates make example tragedy, think needs done: prime example **irresponsible** get vaccinated COVID, what's going happen five kids parents anymore? COVID destroyed entire family, could prevented. articles interview different family member, sounds like vaccinated. Macias 32 weeks pregnant ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù recovery hospitalized first weekend August, Serey said. But, said, expecting mother intubated never met daughter gave birth via Cesarean section Aug. 18. Daniel Macias met fifth child briefly intubated three days 3-week-old daughter remains unnamed  Yep. Everyone gets make choices level risk willing take I'm trying judge people vaccinated reasonable whose tolerance higher mine. (I admit judge people vaccinated taking precautions all; maybe makes hypocrite.) 

It sure feel like folks extending courtesy us lower tolerance. I'm careful must irrational person driven crazy media. fines. fines. strong survive‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm scared devils. Bring it!!!  asked retire supporting science. *liberating would shocking was. 30s. wasn‚Äôt nerve block. injected kind steroid multiple sections much could handle quieted much that, don‚Äôt know steroid(s) anything. awhile i‚Äôll get small flares nothing like then. pain management clinic btw maybe that‚Äôs someplace look into. might ideas could going solutions. know dreadful chronic pain is. hang there!  reliable source variants starting -19 descriptions, stats/figures contagiousness, happened died out? Curious see delta ended one that's worrysome. advice different friends family tell want avoid breakthrough case like mine: leave vaccine. Wear masks, stay away big gatherings unvaccinated people, cut travel, least things calm down.

Common sense advice. family definitely that.

Apparently even ""mild"" case covid still uncomfortable dangerous. interesting humans equate illness dirtiness.

That's also many us end getting virus. hang friends assume ""dirty.""    got combo, depression anxiety attacks true nationally anyone data low vax, high red areas? kind places blue young people often higher vaccinated average older would somewhat less vaccinated, right? maybe? guys pronounce ""moo"" ""myu""? heard pronounced ways. Lol, agreed.

Also GenX. Also bitter. create ‚Äústudy‚Äù inviting 5 million kids vaccinated track results.  everyone decide want take risk.  I‚Äôve trying get family studies since start.  know... puked... rapid tested said comment, wasn‚Äôt reference booster immunity, original vaccine dose. never said thought concrete trumped studies, point expressing frustration seeing vastly different headlines within moments other. It‚Äôs pretty damn unreasonable we‚Äôre middle pandemic children dying this. Meanwhile, vaccines proven safe effective. yes unreasonable now. absolutely downvoted you. still won‚Äôt know better experts two years now. **HUUUUUGE** talking point anti-vaxxers. According vaccine must 100% effective 0% effective. I'm gonna getcha! Vaccinating 20% population within 6 weeks, damn  usually anti-hero action movies finds happens fuck around? Honestly, I'd really like know secret conspiracy kill elderly, minorities others. goal make people upset mass death fear vote republican? somehow profiting mass death big lie? Please educate me, seems suspicious AF rate. Invading countries deliver freedom bombs?

Giving freedom natural resources? sad great job traveling unvaccinated dumbasses. know left death wake.  Individuals embrace one conspiracy theory likely embrace others.

It's occurred vaccine mandate easy way target extremists. may good thing many companies (particularly government employees) people really quit.  haven‚Äôt paid anything kidding. shit worth worrying *before* COVID.

UNION COUNTY, N.C. ‚Äî Union County Public School Board voted Monday morning end COVID-19 contact tracing quarantining non-positive students staff.

That means students go school even come close contact someone COVID positive. people stay home tested positive symptoms.

The decision effective immediately.

Union County schools require masks students staff.

The Union County Board Education met emergency session Monday morning, COVID-19 protocols main focus. Later Monday, school district issued following statement:

‚ÄúAt Sept. 13 Special Called meeting, Union County Board Education voted effective immediately, halt staff responsibilities regarding contact tracing quarantining students staff, except required law. statutory authority managing contact tracing quarantining Union County Public Health.

‚ÄúAs required law, school nurses, administrators school staff continue address positive, presumptive confirmed cases COVID-19. students staff positive COVID-19 test symptoms, return school work immediately.

‚ÄúIf students employees following symptoms: fever chills, sore throat, cough, shortness breath difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle body aches, new loss taste smell, sore throat, congestion runny nose, nausea, diarrhea vomiting, headache, stay home, stay away others call health care provider.

‚ÄúStudents employees isolated due positive case COVID-19 symptoms, report school work completed 10 days isolation, symptoms improved fever free 24 hours without fever-reducing medication.

‚ÄúFace coverings still optional students staff Union County Public Schools.‚Äù

Union County Public Health Director Dennis Joyner sent letter Friday county school district COVID-19 recommendations. letter sent cases number students staff members quarantined continue rise Union County.

**As Friday, 479 students employees tested positive virus, 7,285 quarantine.**

**Union County Schools one five districts North Carolina masks optional.** letter Joyner, advised masks required. also said 14-day quarantine best option help prevent spread COVID-19.

‚ÄúWithout universal mask requirement Union County public schools, 14-day quarantine period remains best option provide protection student, teachers, staff members community,‚Äù letter view full letter, click here.

Many parents favor choice believe COVID-19 rarely harms children. Dr. Benny Joyner, vice chair safety Department Pediatrics UNC Children‚Äôs hospital, said wrong.

‚ÄúI would say need come ICU. I‚Äôve got six, five, critically ill pediatric COVID patients. Two breathing tubes inserted basically breathe them. Two infants,‚Äù said.

‚ÄúWhat would say, delta variant really made respiratory phase illness much prominent before,‚Äù Joyner said. ‚ÄúWe young men women struggling, gasping breathe, unable complete sentences. little babies breathing machines heavily sedated COVID -- it‚Äôs challenge.‚Äù

**The school board heard many parents issue but, far, freedom choose side out.**

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important everyone able tell kids wear can‚Äôt wear,‚Äù parent Eric McCorkle said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad get place society little bit taken away, time little bit little bit know it, it‚Äôs whole lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo keep everybody safe, mandatory wear masks,‚Äù parent Samira Maske said. evidence surface transmission incredibly low. need breathe in, eat it. 

Sanitation still good. concern originally thought. ""When Idaho sends people, they're sending best. They're bringing sickness. They're bringing death. They're anti-vaxxers. some, assume, good people."" 

/s Fact is: first world nation, could much easier lockdown compared people poorer parts world. Distribution developed world first might make sense reducing global death toll good news super antibodies likely worry getting future. mean, test positivity? percentage school population gotten sick? positivity probably depend whether screening tests done, participation rate -- higher screening participation likely push positivity rate uninfected people participating tests. Otherwise, people already expressing symptoms worried exposure.  wondering many certain competed delta. resistant antibodies, resistance mitigating effects competition. Insane  may consolation. I‚Äôve nearsighted glasses since 12. I‚Äôm 50 still don‚Äôt need reading glasses. Can‚Äôt read street sign without glasses read menu, book, phone screen, etc like boss! still much obsession Dr. Fauci among anti-vax/mask community? guy makes like one public statement week nowadays mostly encouraging people get vaccinated stuff. idea think he's champion ""new normal"" there's literally *Zero Covid* internet communities dedicated harassing pro-vaxxers support masks lockdowns enough. Fauci easily moderate hypothetical Covid sentiment spectrum. shows much people actually pay attention. care happens family they're dead dying. they're thinking personally surely fine, even get Covid, consider protecting others - fear nasty vaccine. Life insurance takes account issuing policy think right. know, large noisy minority, I'm getting really tired permitted decide things go everyone. That's back sweeping vaccine mandates.  hospitals look like there? guess I'm saying since NJ high vax rate positive cases actually resulting severe cases lots mild cases vax takes care business?   thought conservatives wanted less government oversight local community centered decisions seems completely opposite values. looked UK chart recently? Cases drop hard last wave previously, they're still well wave 1 peak numbers they've climbing month. Despite fact vaccination rates going up. 

My whole argument article, Vaccinations enough, people need continue things (Masking, distancing, etc.) order keep control.  ""stunningly stupid"" right. believe impact spike finally coming Florida. CDC said vaccinated unmask, everyone did. Even though 50% shots. came Governor took away local governments' ability institute/enforce mitigation measures. Today even threatened fine local governments require vaccines workers. There's going back point. Yeah, man. It‚Äôs getting OLD. 

I background public health even ‚Äúpro-science‚Äù posts twisted warped now. 

I strongly suggest pretty much never taking headline article face value journalists idea interpret data.  Well madness. straight need stop treating anti-vaxxers/maskers COVID. Let die home.  parents vaccinated? everyone cluster vaccinated taken lot potential issues table. eliminated danger, done almost much can.

If wanted even 'protection' maybe discuss booster primary care physician. mean Biden admins plan start rollout boosters 20th month? 3rd shot Pfizer last week. #1 #2 terms effects. 
shot 1, bad, arm soreness, fatigue day next day, 5pm so. 
shot 2, arm soreness, fatigue 5pm day 1, day 2 fatigue set 9:30am, day 3 fatigue less, reminded feeling get sick body still recovering, feeling better. 
shot 3, evening fatigue days 1 2 only, although 45 min nap helped days, day 3 similar shot #2 far feeling like recovering. mutations crossing zoonotic barriers could mean can't cross back humans.

Not necessarily.

The reason well suited infecting wide variety animals infects cells ACE2 Receptors. mammals, birds, even reptiles amphibians cells. long virus still invades cells ACE2 receptor, spread back humans animals. danger wild even domesticated animals also infected unknown quantity coronaviruses may give SARS-2 new genes causing serious illness animal hosts, greatly increase severity illness humans. 

We've seen similar things happen viruses before. ""My cancer remission ‚Äî 9x12 mass shrunk size marble...""

The Dude abides. Glad hear he's mend. Well, considering [over 96% Doctors U.S. vaccinated something bad occur, screwed almost PHYSICIANS U.S. VIOLENTLY ILL EVEN DEAD TOO.

It sound like bright argument people think does. ""Good thing get vaccine, since I'm okay. Hope get sick need type surgery near even far future!"" I'm sure, I'd shocked discussed right circles. seems fairly likely run even laywoman.

The hurricanes make bit sense start year seldom need backup list. something really takes long time plan. wait couple left decide name next, especially premade list like Hebrew Alphabet. asymptomatic transmission period

Can give additional information this? impression asymptomatic transmission observed, sounds like might talking presymptomatic (or mean thing, know).

This hotly discussed item friend group, I'm side ""simply symptomatic give pass whatever"" still spreading.

Source 'against' Asmpytomatic Spread: cluster COVID-19 cases, little transmission occurred asymptomatic case-patients. Presymptomatic transmission frequent symptomatic transmission. serial interval short; short intervals fact detect laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 transmission asymptomatic case-patients line multiple studies (9‚Äì11). However, Oran et al. speculated asymptomatic cases contribute rapid progression pandemic (12). studies may prone misclassify presymptomatic cases asymptomatic, leading heterogeneous reporting SAR asymptomatic cases, different case definitions differential duration follow-up. study used sensitive case definition symptomatic cases require specific symptoms (e.g. fever) present. Also, timing study would enabled detection late onset symptoms, gives us confidence classification exposure groups.

This directly CDC...

WHO hand (for asymptomatic spread) people without symptoms transmit Yes, infected people transmit virus symptoms don‚Äôt symptoms. important people infected identified testing, isolated, and, depending severity disease, receive medical care. Even people confirmed COVID-19 symptoms isolated limit contact others. measures break chains always important stay least 1 metre others, cover mouth cough sneeze bent elbow tissue, clean hands regularly, stay home become unwell asked. areas widespread transmission, also important people wear fabric mask physical distancing control measures cannot implemented.

Really interested additional studies. issues insurance companies pulling benefits people‚Äôs behavior

What exactly think insurance companies do? like major plot point movie Along Came Polly. Ok risk group? 40% Americans obese seems next-biggest risk factor age immunosuppression. cutoff? Yes. would 100% go.

You're vaccinated (and likely boosters Christmas too), 2 years... me, would worth missing family time. Planes airports likely stay mask mandates sometime 2022 earliest foolproof, helpful especially combined vaccine.

Additionally, think things going look different holidays terms case counts - Delta can't surge indefinitely.

My husband live far families too, missed year half family time. got vaccinated, decided going miss more. Everyone's risk analysis looks different, landed side seeing family acceptable risk (I note family vaccinated). Probably, always... initial doses Pfizer. booster repeat shot Pfizer vaccine. understanding mRNA technology they're using covid vaccine going useful potential cancer vaccines well. Here's hoping... Careful, man, there's beverage here! Oh man.

Mine bought plane tickets thanksgiving week crowded city. say they‚Äôre careful, really aren‚Äôt.

Aside ridiculously crowded public workplace, probably exposed 15x many people given week.

They‚Äôre high risk qualified booster late September, want get - anyone actually administering it. good cases falling. ridiculous *once again* whole time cases going up, people would ask ""where's deaths"" mock point deaths peak month cases do. confusion county-level officials outbreak data make available requested. bill meant address that, ~~last minute push~~ last minute push Chamber Commerce stripped away part bill allows public view outbreak data. Getting better... case said he's remission appears he's completely COVID figured that. matches I'm seeing local hospital system live Georgia. Hospitalization 89% unvaccinated local system today ( bounces around 89%-92% mostly depending day ). anyone comparable August maybe September data like this?   It‚Äôs area rug? That's eligible too. Rituxan put list. wonder everyone biologics similar symptoms. Florida resident here. absolutely infuriating. old classmate mine passed away last night Covid. 40 years old. Also lost extended family member early 50s last week. lost count deaths small hometown past two months. insane. Despite that, large number people still staunch antivaxxers. mind boggles. Lately? millions formerly remote workers returning, many whose views vaccine measures reinforced months associating like-minded acquaintances, apt less adaptable open-minded.‚Äù

Yeah sorry, I‚Äôm never going ‚Äúadaptable open-minded‚Äù antimaskers antivaxers materially helping make pandemic worse. speculative reasoning seems like rationale *actual* reason, mentioned scientists paper conspicuously left NBC's report.

[CNN's article elaborate important conclusion. limited supply vaccines save lives made available people appreciable risk serious disease yet received vaccine. Even gain ultimately obtained boosting, outweigh benefits providing initial protection unvaccinated,"" scientists write. ""If vaccines deployed would good, could hasten end pandemic inhibiting evolution variants.""

Which unreasonable; waste limited vaccine supply use may may actually make difference, could using supply make inoculation widespread altogether build herd immunity--something definitely know impactful long run. It‚Äôs actually 0.5% full vaxxed -

Just 256 deaths (0.5%) people fully vaccinated first positive PCR test least 14 days second dose  Every time see something dude, think ""can't get lower that."" almost immediately proves wrong.  looks like someone who's afraid needles. GPA, asking. Similar treatment, switched Rituxan years ago really tamed it. Granulomatosis sucks, matter variety. 

Stay well! Boris Johnson‚Äôs appearance public persona deliberate choices. wants percieved bumbling, shabby aristocrat. Eh, hope it‚Äôs worth it. Anyway, congrats AHL coach getting shot now. üëç   chemo kill immune system though? would figure virus pretty bad chemo. Sure, schools aren‚Äôt either. least kid‚Äôs school. vaccines hep B, prevents liver cancer, HPV, prevents cervical cancer. But, yeah, 2.  mend now.

You're second comment saying post. ""on mend"" means""? Never heard before.  understand you‚Äôre coming from. I‚Äôm sure looked not. city 5 million people it‚Äôs possible contact though. guess it‚Äôs hard know sure without information. No, you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm conflicted it, tell negated within paragraph. 

I‚Äôm laughing idiots far likely die idiocy, sadly behavior going screw everyone else needs care *because will* go hospital get sick. 

I vaccinated, wear mask, advocate those. 

It‚Äôs sad world live in, unfortunately innocent suffer selfishness people. college setting students live dormitories, building-granularity wastewater testing followed targeted testing students dorms virus detected would much efficient &amp; less intrusive.

my understanding colleges quite successfully tamp spread. Yes. get booster. deliberately obtuse. still crickets j&amp;j, one vaccine likely would benefit booster. Wish would transparent preliminary data. feel like sitting duck waiting unknowingly infect family went got first vaccine could back March. art understatement practiced Sweden? say I'm feeling bit off, usually means I'm full-blown cold fever prove it.   also assume took physically create vaccine doses compared manufacturing automation now.

So laughing it? idiots dying important innocent surviving? see saying, getting vaccinated one-time(2 shots) instance. Everything mention behaviors lifestyle choices. see difference ok it. work local government get see statistics least county ratio vaccinated unvaccinated Covid deaths 1:132. Goal what? Goal many possible. Definitely possible. Viruses exchange genetic material co-infection. Would extremely unlikely, it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs lack willing participants attempt almost big cock


Sorry, Get / robots push even line jobs...manager bots still ways way... thoughts measles polio vaccine mandates? Seems reasonable nuanced view.

I expect 3rd dose Pfizer's vaccine wild-type offer much absolute additional protection either hospitalization death. continuing high-quality masking better.

But elderly immunocompromised, there's perhaps real benefit rises noise. long governments (even US) footing bill hospitalization, there's probably age comorbidity threshold total projected costs lower boosters. Israel, 3rd shots initially rolled 60.

I've disappointed we're seeing announced phase III trials vaccines dominant strains, like Delta. Easy adaptation new strains supposedly one benefits mRNA vaccines, another provoke immune responses adenovirus vectors could impede boosters. we're going live indefinitely virus sloshing population (due opposition many NPIs), I'd really like booster reflect current dominant strain (s), whatever immune evading future variant likely arise genetic background. states given reporting numbers covid cases even deaths? looking around can't seem find them. Yeah ‚Äústuck guns‚Äù.  need code register third dose though. definitely gave sense relief, however still worry kids 12 can't vaccinated yet. think people immunocompromised. mother got third dose doctor. 

The person I‚Äôm replying seems like see not, wanted wedding. idea Right, benefit data supports that. bring children nothing boosters. Bad take.. unvaccinated filling hospital ER's. millions riders wearing helmets same, people would angry way.

Fox News pro vax. Lol what? company requires masks management needs grow pair. benefit isn‚Äôt actually there, barely marginal, may recommend 250,000,000 American adults get another shot. course politics involved, pandemic. 

Also, far safety, there‚Äôs reason test things. Particularly children, want make sure vaccines extremely safe worth balancing relatively low risk associated covid children. Yup, cousin spouts chance dying vaccine high 1 million okay 1 100 chance dying covid. People don‚Äôt get basic math it‚Äôs sad. able tell sarcasm way comment written flair? Recommending *third dose* immunocompromised folks ([which isn‚Äôt technically booster, seems caused confusion/opportunism non-immunocompromised ‚Äúdo need booster?‚Äù crowd. 

From article: one knows exactly many booster bandits there. CDC estimated 1 million Americans got unauthorized third shot recommendations immunocompromised people came month ago. Since then, agency counted nearly 1.8 million people gotten ‚Äúadditional‚Äù shot, **but told there‚Äôs virtually way know many actually went folks qualifying immune conditions, patients say they‚Äôre immunocompromised get jab**. There‚Äôs also virtually way know many reported first doses actually illegitimate third shots. guess right. beliefs come emotional place, thats overwhelming discussion facts often ends escalating.

Give booster. Give safe vaccine kids. hydroxychloroquine ivermectin bleach drinking fucks want keep putting rest us risk fuck 'em. Kiwi‚Äôs thread.
How holding think Auckland would go another 4 weeks without seeing protests? really want avoid getting first strain virus. Right virus chewing population still lot completely immune-naive ""susceptible"" people it. fraction population susceptible drops though virus necessarily needs optimize transmission (which also increases virulence/lethality). similar 1918 H1N1 pandemic got worse time went came pandemic strain.

Eventually though near enough 100% people vaccinated recovered, game change virus, better try achieve immune escape. come cost fitness/transmissiblity/virulence collection mutations produce enough immune evation start epidemics recovered people likely longer able optimal transmission. sort see immune evasive strains like mu, they're outcompeted delta far. similar 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain eventually became seasonal influenza (spreading every year 1957 displaced H2N2).

So point avoid getting infected delta give another year two, endemic strains carry less risk going forwards. may also better answers immune compromised.  It‚Äôs almost vaccine works. Who‚Äôd thought?!? /s  Sadly, read justification antivax views. horrible uninformed take...   endemic

Both staunchly antivax. healthy sister asking recommendations ""the best vaccine."" race bottom guy. He's trying out- Trump Trump? Well yea,  Whaaaat? mean ""progressive"" sub *regressive* views science? still disagree even reading Jacob vs Mass right rest solely states one health department. Even bill passed think would get struck courts. 

I‚Äôd love hear constitutional law experts? I‚Äôm sure could try something commerce clause think that‚Äôs OSHA doing. facetious, bc *there many deer here.* thanks adding knowledge today! 1. vaccine ever kind impact far out.

2. year. Trials going last year. people part dropping dead suffering debilitating medical effects? Florida, look, know make fun lot, please take care this? agree mostly. vaccinated interacting immune compromised people, care ability transmit. terms fully healthy vaccinated people isolation, fully agree you.

This think boosters made available want them. person extra concerned infection transmission, able get boosters circulating antibodies rather strictly B/T cell immunity. you‚Äôre chomp üëç Yeah can't imagine anyone could claim unemployment left due foolishness. haven‚Äôt seen rapid testing free. requirement weekly testing can‚Äôt really free tests take 5 days results. Shocking!! wait.....what's word I'm thinking of....oh yeah extremely predictable. He's got money Regeneron antibody treatment (ALSO EUA), one things help chosen vaccinate.  thought afraid covid pandemic already going almost 2 years now. kind timescale we‚Äôre this. Thinking short term led us are, going back forth shit. want end this, need COMMIT solutions. worth, totally anecdotal know. work seriously conservative industry maybe 70% vaxxed recently final uber-conservatives' country clubs mandated get shot. We're two holdouts, mid 20's, super fit hyper-Vegan-lifestyle type people. One got COVID last week.  
Given rate unvaccinated idiots dying vs vaccinated people, I‚Äôm personally laughing behind mask every time see unmasked person. 

I want congregate large groups, want unmasked, want take Ivermectin large quantities, would willing help pay it. 

At point, they‚Äôre self-selecting gene pool. 

All want return enforceable pledge go hospitals they‚Äôre dying. they‚Äôll never give that‚Ä¶..so sick injured unable get care Covidiots overwhelm healthcare system yet again. What's everyone's current opinion US holidays coming up? I'm debating whether see parents Christmas. However I'd flying way across country feel pretty anxious it. I'm vaccinated, however higher risk blood clots would higher risk normal (but think I'm deemed ""high risk"").

I'd love see parents holidays 2 years since last saw them, mother recently really awful hospital scare. just....I know. Sad preventable. Quick note - family member works delivery large hospital - far staff vaccinated - however, gather, 1 10 women come positive COVID those, something like 1/2 lose child. know unscientific second hand account, frustration real.

That said, saves lives, suppose leave may better option. feel bad staff pick up.

On flip side, city offering INSANE money traveling nurses, think heard something like $8k $12k WEEK help bridge gulf availability demand, still enough staff. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I'm covered unvaccinated thing far I'm concerned. talking variant, Covid soo retry different got first dose Delta starting spread like wildfire country, always knew one give much protection, definitely felt safer relaxed second dose. Emboldened even. Even rode train, first time since January 2020. Little different got AZ first. onset side effects fast, within 5-6 hours. fever, chills, uncontrollable shakes, nausea, muscle fatigue several hours. Next morning felt like crap stayed home work. Felt muscle soreness, nausea, overall body fatigue later afternoon fine. Pfizer second shot. Felt tired body fatigued next day (like overextended run something ran empty), nauseous off. Pfizer third shot past Friday. First time three arm felt really sore (like punched hard arm). Saturday felt muscle fatigue (especially legs), tired even want go kitchen water tired, splitting headache. Felt less tired Sunday headache stuck around. Today feel fine. third shot overall much better experience 1 &amp; 2 though! How, without home address? First 2 Pfizer shots got mild headache days. got 3rd shot last week arm sore low-grade fever 24 hours felt achy fluish. day 2 pretty much back normal. I'm vaccinated union steward office. We're 65% vaccinated shift that's affectionately known ""The Fox News Hour"". almost entirely unvaccinated shift, also shift outbreak last year, owners one two COVID deaths agency record.

I constantly deal people part crew wearing masks, complaining do, nearly every week bugging about, ""what's union going mandate comes down?"" Like union able anything mandate comes down.

They living proof what's wrong country; conspiracy theory laden, irrational extreme, completely unapproachable regarding compromises. I'm ears strategies, BTW... AMA: 
   getting flu shot every 12 months, what's difference? Realistically speaking, follow recommended schedule vaccines course life probably getting one every 6-12 months anyway. Nope. contagious Delta. Yeah, problem COVID misinformation, distrust government existed way before. Though even trust government quite obvious vaccines safe. Either way, guess also true least mandate cave take vax keep job. there's also much else government it, I'm afraid accepted never get matter government anyone does. implying agree me? science: mom got #3 Moderna past weekend Saturday. SLE lupus achondroplasia. 

Despite taking acetaminophen hour beforehand, ran high fever 5-6 hours later, another low fever 24 hours later. arm extremely sore tender still. tired, too. 

Her arm big, red circle looks like raised spider bite injection site. circle become less red spread rest arm since injection.

She walk-in pharmacy thinks probably defrost serum completely. 

While intense fevers previous shots, reaction injection site new. 

Otherwise, good spirits fever free. 

She wants alive see grandbabies grow up. Why? Okay year? people always wondering often need take vaccine? say something, mean imply it.  There's great thing called lying personal gain. Republican Governors lately. friend mine said third worse second deaths happen weekend go back several days.

Seems like misleading headline ethical dilemma sitting unused US pharmacies. never going help countries. remember covid way out, almost 2 years later... enough data conclusively say booster helpful populations already two doses. However *tremendous* amount data shows helpful two shots current variants. 

Reducing overall global infections help new variants created. Lancet article states distributing vaccines currently allocated United States (third dose) populations zero doses efficient epidemiological strategy combatting virus.

Well, want firm date want soonest date? Israel looking evidence national health system, specifically info vaccine effectiveness corresponds time vaccination. study would explain conclusions, literally looking data directly health system. 

Other countries, part, releasing information broken way. similar report found UK, covered 4 months post vax. Israel, least August reporting, reported major decline effectiveness happened right around 4 months. 

From Israel's perspective, though, health data shows vaccines less 80% percent effective hospitalization (as discussed Fauci Andy Slavitt podcast last week), would irresponsible government issue boosters people. government consider same, given can't really track info here.

Catching covid crisis some.

This one angle *very* complex picture. Probably every response get comment correct, even conflict. human mind yield single explanation. get enough angles see from, enough lenses look through, start feel works. me, people feel damaged, deeply insecure, terrified, yet still trying best. means hospitals constantly staying currently limits ability help people, that's really acceptable outcome. Especially ridiculous spending massive burnout trained personnel happening.

Suddenly creating tens thousands full time healthcare jobs specifically deal realistic solution either, least short term.

Vaccine mandates enforcement way forward *should* lead end. People going get third shot original vaccine government approves boosters.

But US government's plan *is* use same, original vaccine booster. Pfizer also developing different vaccine targets new variants, approved yet, government's plan use new vaccine. I'm curious spent money resources booster shot instead vaccine kids. I'm sure reasons, still....We sent unvaccinated kids school. feel like disaster looming ahead. homeschool last year worst thing ever done entire lif. hope come vaccine kids soon keep school going.

Interesting. Citation please? struggling trying reconcile Israel's rather poor performance UK's excellent performance sounds like good reason. Gooootcha  fully vaccinated worrying booster shot neither CDC FDA currently recommend? think overly worrying quite lot unless extreme high risk condition. could probably invade. bet oil, there's one way find out! US, recommended time shots was/is 3 weeks. Israel, might OK reference point sense. got Xeon! get? He's vaccinated lol

Is daily beast reliable source? Sounds dumb lol millimeters 9x12 would already size marble makes think 9x12 centimeters start. doubt imperial units 9x12 meters right out. Actual paper here: couple notes:  

1) Boosters appropriate ""general population"", high risk groups warrant investigation. 


2) Given limited supply doses, better public health increase initial doses moving boosters, already excellent protection serious disease offered initial doses. that's it? boosters all, even elderly high risk people??? Thank you! came close work December late March. He's 95% back old self, got vaccinated together end March too. worries catching giving parents?

If latter get antigen tests test run trip get there. Awesome hear. Everyone household visits must vaccinated, toddler cannot vaccinated yet. Every pediatric hospital area overwhelmed right now. Whether ""deadly"" not, feel like spending night days facility considering long-term effects daughter may get. vaccine ever stopped testing positive covid. Educate yourself. American healthcare hybrid of:

\- caring professionals job

\- insurance companies hospitals/clinics shuffling cards like magicians robbing us blind Vaccination give 3-30x additional protection, yes, 30 children kindergarden room school class get 30x viral load. boosters approved all, US government would need buy extra doses labs. current surplus enough cover 150+ million boosters.

Edit: clear. agree boosting inmunocompromised. agree boosters eligible. Also, lack boosters main factor driving saturation health care system, unvaccinated main culprits that. Yes  Hate break 25 average *daily new* cases Vermont. Active cases Vermont like 500 per hundred thousand. CDC estimates 4 unreported cases per reported case. 

Vermont getting hit less hard delta variant. National average peaked around 50/100k new cases per day wave. Florida peaked 100/100k. Vermont 1.6 vaccine doses per person vs national average 1.4 doses.  extra 1/10 people getting taking step cuts peak half step pretty good one take. loser. Sounds like FOIA request waiting happen. Israel get third dose able go movies importantly my. case enter college.
so im going get third one evendo second one made weak weeks. personal experience, yes. Glad made - paranoid AF I'd catch covid chemo.

Fortunately cancer sufferers, chemotherapy really come long way tends far less total suckage used to. Lymphoma one harsh ones - [Harvey documented much sucked [Our Cancer 30+ years ago. oncologist familiar comic and, aside cancer much less rough one treat, reported someone cancer today would much easier time. Yay science! Good point definitely need recognize get *a lot* worse school opens head holidays. time saying ""Oh, well, still 75-90% severe disease, let's see happens months.""... No, numbers enough seniors/high risk/frontline get *now*, everyone else probably thanksgiving. CMs That's true. combined flu/Covid shot would make sense. currently unclear whether law 100 location company. There's also question remote workers (which sounds like entire company moment) need comply. various studies 10-88% people contracted covid organ damage and/or long term disability. one study young patients mild symptoms 70% seems data points 40% average number groups. data vaccination helps assume doesn't.

I'm concerned about, example, developing neurological disability ruined lungs next 50 years dying, personally. die, suspect I'll much say feel subject. I'm suddenly unable things every day devastating me.

When someone ""accepting risk"" they're imposing risk without consent. remember movie Thank Smoking main character explaining win argument. make opponent lose.

I feel antivax movement see Fauci opponent must portray losing every time speaks. He's living rent free heads seek every opportunity attack him. make covid-19 state protections endangered virus species already. Hell, make Florida Mascot already. hell going ama mean? relatively young healthy intention getting booster unless required. I'd much rather someone else get first shot get third. scientifically medically proven need except people high risk groups. unvaccinated workers worked company office would everything power get fired. course we‚Äôre bitter. We‚Äôre either ignored altogether lumped boomers. Latter worse former.  shots sent low income countries shots used boosters right now. people don‚Äôt get boosters, shots get tossed.

It‚Äôs simple chucking un-used vials vaccine mail.

The US healthcare system completely overrun. people don‚Äôt get time work. mild case covid one doesn‚Äôt put hospital- many, leaves people sick weeks. people can‚Äôt afford take weeks work.

And there‚Äôs millions upon millions people immunocompromised, well people around them. hospitals overrun, avoiding infection entirely necessary people high risk, well live them. formal definition proof ""immunocompromised."" say are... two aunts early 70s refuse get vaccinated, somehow. even month ago lost aunt (not due covid). I'm afraid lose 2 aunts aswell.  
Then dad step sis, he's kidney transplant patient. tested blood almost antibodies even tho double vaxxed. man fragile, wise.
I'm afraid I'll lose too. due wisdom, I'm sure he'll last 3.

I'll make sure enjoy time best capabilities. course did...that's next level social distancing. fuck given advice take 3 weeks then?

Where data supporting 12 week interval better 3 weeks? anyone logically explain would protest front hospital? BS. throwing away. someone wants get one, let them. bandit taking something would thrown away otherwise.  Reminder 7DA cases might *appear* sharply rise today we're one week past Labor day. got second moderna shot end March. vaccine still providing protection effectiveness worn off? Sorry, little confused. explain further? literally thing.   cancer treatment last year let tell you, get COVID it‚Äôs going worse normal due immune system shot. I‚Äôve COVID treatment worse. I‚Äôm also 36 probably hit differently.  song-and-dance routine American health insurance great?

Hospital: ""Hey insurance, aspirin administration like $2000 us"".

Insurance: ""No bet like $500""

Hospital: ""Yeah mean $500""

Insurance: ""Cool, let's charge patient half amount"".

Patient: ""Wow expensive. **Good thing health insurance!**""  mean refusing vaccine one thing, refusing tested? That's even ridiculous. imagine someone showing workplace people showing symptoms refusing get tested? might get arrested.

If ""go for"" either vaccine testing might ""go for"" pay check either. takes build hospital ""State"" polite term selfishness wear mask indoors crowded outdoors 90% adults vaccinated.

I feel safe confident get infected I'll okay wear mask reduce chances spread others might lucky. I‚Äôm glad beat it! hope never suffers again. arguing whether right wrong. saying socially over. Individuals choose take increased precautions, majority hasn‚Äôt far won‚Äôt. ""Competing"" guess terminology only; that's humans keeping score proportion infections we've keep tally sequencing labs. we've sequenced past weeks, Delta holding steady near 99% Mu 0.1% decreasing (it 3.7% mid-June). Mu news right we've learned new knew nothing. Delta really thought less lethal strains, either pretty close tad higher last saw reported. yeah think people Delta antibodies probably slow variants getting footing. that's say ""let rip"" strategy way good plan, lol.

If asking Delta viral particle Mu viral particle literally compete, like let Delta patient Mu patient cough directly mouth, I'm sure would happen. one, other, would take hold me; I'm sure! Morbidly curious thought experiment, wonder virologist answered somewhere. able that? Biden mandated govt employees. Newsflash dipshit! say supercedes yours! Virginia data infection per 100,000"" 411, 1436 3493 vaccinated, partially vaccinated unvaccinated, respectively.

As point number cases found also depends amount testing, test lot tend find less severe cases (rather someone showing sick). OK, 6% cases led hospitalizations probably lot mild cases. true. Anecdotal evidence, got breakthrough Delta 1 month ago, kids never got it. vaccine job protected them.  wanna hear joke?

people getting vaccine. That‚Äôs people literally calling about. 100% used 911 dispatcher made ~$19/hr. can't believe amount stress I'd shifts things deal with. make like twice biggest worry what's dinner. Life's fucked man. certainly make pandemic over. fact, making opposite happen vaccinated really care (when) get covid continuing live hiding viable. wish everyone would get vaccinated support measures get many vaccinated possible. time, believe making choice accepting risk, refuse let decision affect choice return normal life.

As society, need stop worrying transmission. vaccinated young, mostly non issue. 4th dose ascend beyond corona, longer affected puny virus. 5th dose, see vira air, they‚Äôre everywhere‚Ä¶ must destroyed. 6th dose, elimate vira aura presence.

Anyway

Stay well, Dude.  neither!! vaccinated men. men matter...  got 5G. terrible phone reception shot. great, though toaster burning toast. think jealous. I'm aghast dumpster fire job Florida government also like misled. article says ""Those deaths happen weekend go back several days."" please amend post. cure worse disease

Got science back bold statement?  really longer care. know several people covid recovered lasting effects. credible studies I've seen show 90% lasting symptoms clear 2 weeks.

I'm imposing risk you. socially distance, wear mask, stay home anything else makes feel safer better. tell do. recommended mitigations 15 months viable way relatively safe. good enough. mean, yes. staying current job likely better alternative. Little instituted mask mandates would either lose next primary immediately recalled, putting someone charge would would even worse. Meanwhile general public wouldn‚Äôt follow mandates anyway. trying keep job least make impact. get $10 pharmacy. article says that's much claims daily testing would hit obscene numbers (which, yeah would daily overkill) conclusion based incomplete analysis available data vague thresholds ""highly effective"" means.

For everyone, effectiveness severe disease, month July delta dominant many reached 5-6 months, protection varied 73% 90%. seniors, lower. mention lower number findings, Mayo Clinic study could criticize wide CI, mention CDC cited paper seniors. clear definition ""highly effective"" subject disagreement representative totality data.

At *bare minimum*, there's adequate justification need benefit boosters elderly, high risk, healthcare workers. Many people advised take vaccines reduced immune response due cancer illnesses. Aside hospital workers, may understand infection protocol also can‚Äôt really social distance known Covid patients. One important implications study, experts say, introduction vaccines strongly correlates greater share COVID hospital patients mild asymptomatic disease. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs underreported well vaccine makes life better, much less sick likely be, less sick even hospitalized,‚Äù Snyder said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gem study.‚Äù come post conspiracy sub, absolutely right.  boosters young, healthy people aren‚Äôt approved reason.

Because politics social equity. already determined booster gain outweighs risk. Lol got owned wonder accurate number given lots people getting unofficial boosters.  Dude, get vaccinated. Good Ok. wondering maybe ""on mend"" regional unaware.

It means someone process healing they're serious risky part injury illness waiting body finish healing. mention battle COVID probably made worse fact weak immune system *due cancer treatment*. Obviously COVID actually straight-up worse cancer. Virtually one fighting COVID without cancer would say ""Man, sure wish cancer instead COVID right now"". longer interval gives better response pfizer, too, especially Delta. later finding. \[Morgan Freeman Voice\] 
I know turned Andy suspect died COVID. speak much felt Andy gotten COVID shot since make it, family would gotten death benefit money. $500K get much prison lot trouble. However, family, stay alive start new life. 
We'll always miss Andy. truth Absolutely livid right now. Supposed go hiking trip days near kid tested positive Saturday. never touched kid even really close (I'd confidently say 6 feet apart entire time never touched anything would've)

What's general timeline? Like home tests....at point would unlikely got flying Thursday around kid Saturday evening cutting close? depression like: DOUBT  I'm annoyed Moderna Cove (phase 3) study, got shots 13 months ago. hear sites throwing away millions doses antivaxxer activism, can't get one? * First shot Moderna soreness arm 2 days. 
* Second shot gave 101 degree fever, sweats, chills, body ache started 12 hours shot, ended another 12 hours. came went extremely fast .
* Third shot much like second lasted 12 hours, everything lessened. fever got 100, generally high 99s. generally tired. feel sick, generally shitty. hahaha

came say   getting vaccinated would make safer. Possibly marginally kind unknown. You‚Äôre 100% correct. subway line take comes Bronx, mask adherence abysmal. Vaccinated people UES likely wear mask unvaccinated people Bronx Brooklyn. 

The difference poor democrats don‚Äôt get vaccine don‚Äôt scream social media like poor republicans do, even though believing similar conspiracy theories. think people hearing option getting tested instead. quit job they're going go find another company either less 100 employees willing flaunt rules.

And large company flaunting rules outbreak people get virus feel workspace unsafe file lawsuit, it'll even bigger problem them. Companies resisted kinds workplace safety measures years. end simple two large steps: 

1) Vaccine approval kids 
2) Vaccine passport 
3) Enforcement 2 

1 happen, #2/3 done shittily everywhere except SF NY odds done widescale outside low. vaccines first approved, lot data comparing different intervals. vaccines approved based 3/4 week (pfizer/moderna) interval. largely speed approval, ""perfect"" interval.

Once data came (well regular population US could get vaccinated), agile countries changed interval 10 12 weeks. two great effects: (1) Better immunity recipient, (2) Allowed supply go towards first shots people ASAP. First doses first (FDF) gets people ~70%+ immunity protection severe illness, bumping another 20-30% second shot.

I got 2nd shot 12 weeks side effects. 3 week interval likely cause extreme immune reaction too, thus also cause myocarditis (relatively minor) side effects we're seeing vaccination.

The CDC failing America refusing act updated data swiftly. Thousands died CDC afraid take action consistently punts ""well, original studies done, keep it"". You‚Äôre downvoted lot cancers kill don‚Äôt make feel anything it‚Äôs late.   fair point. shorthanded healthy, many moderately obese people considered otherwise healthy, COVID fully concede obesity huge risk factor one warrants second/third dose. lancet study really opened eyes this:   potential, yet extremely unlikely risk? Myocarditis also risk breakthrough infections. 

Their point risk reasoning behind advice, it‚Äôs ridiculous. vaccines risk. Extremely rare side effects largely temporary people effected enough reason. hospital system become ""COVID patient system"" people requiring healthcare reason denied, often deadly consequences.

Too much ""moving on"" addressing pandemic turn pandemic COVID, pandemic every treatable illness, disease, emergency. country many idiots. keep nonsense? absolutely crushed flu last season extra sanitation. cases even figure effective vaccine was. Yeah symptoms - mild - lasted month. loss taste annoying SOB kinda sucky, lingers.  dad got third shot cancer getting radiation soon. 63M. 

Sore arm, nothing else. like shots. ""Those without vaccine, whatever reason, could feel ostracized, experts say"" 

That's... supposed work, kind messed headline that? making kind guide antivax, sorry them?

(Yes, read article, complain misleading headlines quotes creates doubt vaccines, encouraging them) Right. They're screaming headlines third world countries need first seem bury boosters certainly make difference. Thank service :) God that's awful! I'm surprised hear one best aquifers nation taken granted. wish comfortable moving back tap water alone. Working 

Yeah made mad confused well 

Like go protest government office something rather stopping health care workers helping people work big company mandating vaccine. already ~85% vaccination rate site work at, though I'm still WFH. small vocal minority angry planning quitting. policy fully vaxxed mid-November fired.

*Editing say mention specifically due federal mandate, zero problem mandating vaccines Delta here. reason ripping unvaccinated south leaving densest population unscathed vaccines prior immunity. 

This thing contagious fuck. It‚Äôs suddenly going contagious NYC month now, especially given companies/state agencies requiring vaccines. borders magical thinking believe boosters help breakthroughs, Israel data showing obvious outcome fact actual outcome.

If want make argument boosters, fine, making fantastically unlikely claims bordering magic. need adhere [Swiss Cheese instead depending entirely perfect single intervention method.

CDC's removal mask recommendations vaccinated persons among worst decisions managing pandemic far. Jeff Bridges cancer?!?!?! got Pfizer first second shots, got Moderna booster 4.5 months 2nd Pfizer.

I side effects first Pfizer shot.

I chills, body aches, fever less 24 hours second Pfizer shot. 

The Moderna shot gave chills body aches (but fever) less 24 hours. week ago would said 80. new ruling - 85+ seem realistic . There‚Äôs like 10% would burned alive taking vaccine would approaching upper limit tumor fucking decimeter!? Punish what? look New York Times different perspective. 

The amount new cases Vermont 180 reported September 12

It seven day average 26 per hundred thousand people much higher New York City seven day period 16. 

Just read Times. wish ill Vermont one highest vaccinated states deserve credit it. go ‚Äúchoose places track‚Äù see difference say Vermont New York City New York state overall 23 per hundred thousand 

I simply wondering higher seven day average vaccinated. I‚Äôm making accusations wondering Well, unvaccinated people taking away freedoms vaccinated? everyone's freedoms count? [Pew J&amp;J? I‚Äôve seen next nothing efficacy booster shots them.  We've several people get breakthrough infections workplace. Zero ended hospital. Compare vaccines, end there. lasting symptoms seems dissipated lingered months infected. Again, workplace, one breakthrough infection reported anything beyond mild flu cold symptoms. great harm reduction. They're also getting vaccinated more.

Guess people want covid! mean WV. knew something good last long. Go away kook Bananas obviously.

Seriously though glad he's better. mom cancer we've tried b careful since know effective vaccination stories like I'm scared get sick. know would make even vaccination, know? excellent example selection bias. people got actual mild breakthrough case take time tweet never hear them. horror!

And not? ""too much work me"" i'll get sick help transmit virus""?  I‚Äôd like see counter protest someone dumping cots body bags. leaving. saw. Thanks! vaccinated looking forward normal holiday season.  Yep. take matters hands. also tells awful lot employability. I'm saying unemployment something taken lightly, people skills *truely* transferable worried are.

It's certainly interesting watch.  make sound reasonable downplaying strength degree evidence much effectiveness dropped July. 

They make mention several data sources back Mayo Clinic number complain wide CI. make mention CDC cited study showing elderly significantly rosier studies.

And significantly, keep using extremely vague language never mention level effectiveness mean say 'data shows still highly effective'. cited available data, gave numbers... conclusion would *far* weaker, especially even attempt quantify benefit... given current production levels, withheld boosters, much faster could world get vaccinated? US, Pfizer Moderna productions numbers answer month less, exports alone. 

Their misrepresentations, strongly everyone going disagree, already fueling antivax ivermectin lunatics, want pretend disagreement comparable disagree... **it's not**. Numerous credible authorities disagreeing here, fringe wackadoos. Well one well recognized spokespeople distinction working closely two administrations.

And says things are, opinion, response-worthy. Like randomly starting wear two masks ""common sense"", using different numbers herd immunity different times depending talking to. think heart right place he's inconsistent mixed like everyone else trying provide guidance. person responded seemed think reasoning behind advice didn‚Äôt include potential risks all, even though it‚Äôs clearly stated. free vaccines widely available months. Anyone vaccinated done willingly. 

Protect protected first. vaccines run anti-vax whack job chance reconsider, well that‚Äôs bad; it‚Äôs them. I‚Äôm sick health ruled lowest common denominator. someone got J&amp;J, concur Israeli data (at point, millions booster shots administered) shows vast majority (~80%) worse side effects 2nd dose. 

Personally, pretty intense side effects doses, 3rd dose closer 1st.

Extremely happy gotten booster. Israeli data shows boosts protection **11x** brings efficacy vaccine back 95% Delta. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That‚Äôs true, almost data go things comes kids. I‚Äôm downvoted oblivion, remains true injury rate young children low need large sample size vaccines determine whether vaccine giving greater benefit minuscule risks posed vaccine itself. 

The UK far declined approve vaccines lower age groups exactly reason:

‚ÄúBut children low risk virus, JCVI decided vaccination would offer ""marginal gain"" and, therefore, ""insufficient"" evidence offer mass vaccination age group.‚Äù yes everything fine? go pharmacy adjust age? kiddo Oct 2010, respiratory condition size large 12 year old somI definitely considered this.  Well that's felt getting J&amp;J vaccine itself.  This!

Especially since Israeli data shows need 50 population. Even 50 70 population, Plus never mention hospital staff stubborn ones. know play important role stop operations, LVNs? Obstetrician? Neonatal surgeon? Receptionist? Uhhhhh simplify bit non-scientists? I'm suggesting cut everything lockdown one year. Playing safe though may still get benefits. treatments cures disease way, like vaccines way last year. available cures would ease much stress, even getting breakthrough infection gets even manageable. E.g. antivirals, easy-to-administer monoclonal antibodies.  Seriously, wife, Davy Macias, 37, labor delivery nurse, died Aug. 26, days **after giving birth ventilator**, McClatchy News reported. Neither vaccinated coronavirus.  newborn baby girl named family hoped Daniel Macias, fell ill days wife, would recover name her, KTLA reported.

The mom never got chance kiss little girl. even name. fucked that? easier someone lie say religious objection find doctor lie say medical exception. Especially locality accepting chiropractor notes someone medically unable get vaccine. problem! Honestly today's flood responses made optimistic. normally get good reception stuff. data shows need 3rd dose 50 population. 50 70, debatable. It'd definitely help 70+ I'm 99.999% sure doctor told get vaccine. ignored doctor's advice.

Most counties area ~60%+ fully vaccinated, lots stuff permanently moved outdoors (outdoor dining everywhere, ordering coffee walk window instead going in, etc), places know importance ventilation you‚Äôll see lots doors/windows propped open go places.

You correct, FDA dropped ball that. wanted kids clinical trials told Pfizer Moderna way back getting started. nation half extreme view individualism sense community common good Wild West frontier ""anything goes"" lifestyle seen golden era, news always going like this.

Back like 50% staff refusing get vaccinated wear mask. mental health deteriorated  like virus get you, depression anxiety will. really reputation, slogan.  need specific dates, give us frequent updates progress. chances killing someone like post vaccination really quite small. combine data points another source read recently suggests risk would reduced factor 10 booster, takes odds .0005 .00005, I'm particularly concerned.

This looking data population standpoint always transfer well individuals. would certainly feel effects step change like among millions. little old trying figure do? case compelling, personally feel would better served waiting data spacing studies even possibly mixed vaccine regimens. windows open security concerns sad reality American schools. reason selfish, reason shunned criticizing it, would rather criticize listen virologists medical professionals who‚Äôve spent years lives dedicated helping saving people. might perfect reducing spread make you, oh don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt *die.* dying sounds pretty great me.  Seems like people previous infection similarly protected death hospitalization delta variant pretty well protected infection. 

But example sister works hospital. get TDAP, flu, shots. accept positive flu test lieu getting vaccinated that, see COVID would different. 

Also LOT people swear COVID never got tested. Usually think December 2019-March 2020 highly unlikely happens season everyone gets colds anyways. sure 12-17 age group approximately 10% adults (over 18) Covid without receiving vaccines. used CDC data come number.  type 2 diabetes lol. Anything victim guess. save energy holding caps key type mu I‚Äôve decided pay much attention Israel covid/vaccine developments. seem largely outlier everything, refusal release meaningful data anyone outside company profits giving many doses possible leaves little skeptical. Covid could recur, offers short term immunity, Coronaviruses. beginning last year hopium belief like measles getting forever immunity.  it‚Äôs antibody resistant, feel that‚Äôs far overstatement, bodies immune system still recognizes it, still attack it, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs novel stage anymore one ever said masks ineffective COVID. However, indeed time *widespread* *mask* *usage* detrimental public health perspective (because PPE shortage, masks exclusive healthcare workers).

There backpedaling. would like see breakdown long-haul COVID results country.   
   
Reason Americans need work sickness ""tough out"". see HCA awards people keep trying chores or, God forbid, go outside house.   
   
Compare to, say Sweden, accommodating work home cognizant resting sick. friends go ""were feeling bit off"". 

It may nothing, considering anything beyond resting puts least minimal strain lungs, could create issues. Mine 60‚Äôs - enough risks doc approved 3rd Moderna shot late month, six months last dose.

They sign form stating they‚Äôre high risk category get shot.  Enlighten darling Depends. HIV falls category still us. idea. Still far less screwed morons haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine. It‚Äôs vira vector vaccine ao uses weak adenovirus make cells create specific proteins virus trains immune system knock out.

You‚Äôll fine likely. comment essentially correct. behavior refuse get vaccine manifestly poor. yet see interview anti-mask anti-vax individuals quickly devolve ""my freedom"" ""those pushing mandates dangerous"" ""vaccines conspiracy.""

The vaccines safe, mandates vaccination, masking, effective treatments defeated deadly dangerous pandemics, practiced centuries. 

While know one post anger unvaccinated, objective fact behavior lead many becoming sick, yes many dying. data covid survives increased impotance rates That's wrong. Excess food health risk itself. athletes need thousands calories average person training/etc; conflating eating lot obesity. Obesity certainly caused eating much, many factors go obesity.

I agree people need make better choices comes eating. that's complex issue making be. eat clean/work out, I'm leaner probably 90% people planet, luxury that. expect people knowledge interest following similar diets, especially behemoth corporate marketing decades sophistication fight everywhere turn, television advertising, nutritional (mis)information, simply buying food grocery store. way advertising physical placement items shelves planned hijack programming human brain, easy ""well buy healthier food!"" people perhaps is, others best, view quite reductive.

That said, yes, people US unhealthy. mean insurance premiums go them? No, healthcare system US broken/dum af easily parsed ""fat people take care pay more"". Mu antibody resistant, it‚Äôs really competition‚Ä¶? widespread loathing nurses doctors don‚Äôt value opinions? think found problem. wear different brand googled around best price. ordered totally satisfied. ordered January 15% free shipping, got year's worth something like $115 instead 300 locally. 

I bet run special every year, also get $15 deals offered regularly want say good new-customer discount well. answered email really quick nice too. almost 2 years invest expanding healthcare hospitals. overrun almost choice now. Natural selection probably favor situation. virus kills faster infects ""burn out"" would ineffective spreading.

I've gone two flights year. multiple signs messages airlines/airports provide ahead time. Delta even 3 point questionnaire covid guidelines precautions. 

In reality, man given plenty context clues warnings even boarding. would terrible detective. Ya. max even 401(k). It‚Äôs bad people aren‚Äôt able it. understand it. It‚Äôs bit bummer insurance reps tell difference insurance policies aren‚Äôt allowed give ‚Äútax advice‚Äù (unless happen also tax advisors) people rarely get whole picture explained enrollment time. things equal, deadly, infected much chance spread virus dies runs hosts.

Edit: guess also assumes would get much sick two week. get vaccine now?! Please tell planning to. bribe though? Many states tried literal bribes limited success. punishment avoidance. Yeah, it‚Äôs resistant antibodies, don‚Äôt see would out-compete Delta. think people getting seriously ill and/or dying scaring people straight (at least anecdotally life), sadly taking seeing close personal people realize.

WELL, DUH. trolling common sense. vaccine go life done point. ever gave shit people

Completely untrue, it‚Äôs clear never still don‚Äôt. point arguing you.   point brought university‚Äôs last covid briefing - surveillance testing worth effort age vaccines Delta variant. Bc Delta spreads fast, negative test could end providing false sense reassurance person around them. funny time spent watching nutjob video, could watched 10 min video like ICU nurse covid. Australia third option seems likely - caught quarantine.

It's lines authorities reveal when, man caught virus, incubation period longer 21 days highly unusual.

And something authorities likely know fairly definitively, assuming screen genomics incoming cases.  Covaxin Oxford Here's one . VAX ,no job, hospital ,no doctor,no school come around me,I'll knock ass out. rights end ,when interfere mine. wear damn mask,they've wearing mask china years dirty air. want use religion read lev. 13,I think verses 48 49. yeah, Delta higher R (around 6)
 
worst case scenario is, Delta already burn out, immunity recovered Delta partially neutralize Mu variant.. Mu would dominant variant..
 
now let's look back July.. said Mu 2% prevalence July.. 12 July, 7 days average Covid case USA around 30k cases day..
 
compare 12 September 7 days average around 150k
 
2% 30k 600 
1% 150k 1500
 
Delta outcompete Mu variant, exactly crush it..
 
and Rt higher 1 hate use meaningless modifiers like within two weeks announcement, we‚Äôve seen nearly 20%, one-fifth, 20,000 decide get vaccine,‚Äù 

So 4000. 91,000. 

4.4 percent.  

Big f-g deal /s

Not ‚Äúhuge‚Äù. Oh no.   seems like really firm date like... day they're approving happen know whose expense regular testing occur? think battlegrounds drawn around ""severe disease"". humble opinion, think battle scientists administration quite unfair people. thorough credible CDC lead studies long COVID vaccinated end hospital. AFAIK can't even define constitutes long COVID. know random studies there, different conclusions, plenty anecdotal evidence place. want accept chance getting COVID (when boosters clearly available) convince **my** best interest. someone tell story? I'm Europe, access article. Thank advance! would know since schedule test work day, rapid tests free available pharmacies Switzerland, though believe 5x kit per person per month limit mean...this we're headed US, can't find fault really. 

We reach point accept going live long term, focus energy political capital pushing vaccines everyone. Mask mandates, travel restrictions, distancing vaccinated nothing stop spread (only delay inevitability) eats huge amount attention media, making push vaccines difficult focus on. 

Has anyone noticed flurry articles past week saying basically thing, need realign expectations ""control"" pandemic means? Even Surgeon General quoted week saying end Covid ""doesn't mean cases.""

The line ""*when*"" get point debate, think we've crossed threshold ""*if*"" heading it. I‚Äôd give advantage  probably teaches religious studies ancient worlds According NHTSA, schoolchildren likely killed bus ride school COVID. 

I don‚Äôt blame anyone worried. media scaring crap people stuff. Fortunately seems like university‚Äôs administration taken stance, accepting covid stay need coexist without like locking forever. I‚Äôm honestly surprised this, restrictive throughout past year - even cancelled commencement plenty ways safely outside. hope even university implements mandatory testing, administration professors know raw cases best metric vaccine almost everyone‚Äôs gotten it, won‚Äôt overreact case counts. No, it‚Äôs part image. Effective yes, ‚Äúas effective‚Äù vs alpha, no. wasn‚Äôt point Agreed. Case numbers rely testing reporting, it‚Äôs easy under-test many people using home tests likely self-reporting. Hospitalizations better metric. also find waste water monitoring data interesting. think people still think cases going UK since early summer decline aware surged (excluding last 5 days dip So, going donated poorer countries? Thanks fucking hospitals, potato-heads. bought 4 tests 100 bucks. THANKS CAPITALISM  Well, generally, athletes shouldn‚Äôt try train hard *while actively sick*, regardless whether it‚Äôs covid. 

*That said*, didn‚Äôt know nearly much longterm recovery last June/July/August, especially young people. lot scientists busy studying importance physical activity time states/cities ‚Äúsafer home‚Äù guidelines people working home, fwiw. 

For example, even current sport guidelines still emphasize avoiding training unwell, [but say little nothing avoiding sport ‚Äúweeks‚Äù understand confusion. see U.S democracy oligarchy therefore bad.

Oh definitely want know me, thus post.  think 2doses provides enough resistance Delta infection/transmission even match Delta's extra transmissibility, surprise places 90%+ 2/3rds vaccinated still seeing Delta.

We're still seeing 80%+ effectiveness two doses Canada, issue getting remaining 15-20% vaccinated.  I'm relying complete data set, rather abortion one USA, near complete, broken down, virtually serological testing, variant testing, biased cdc policy.

You deluding yourself. There's evidence az massively different terms sterilizing immunity Pfizer moderna, especially time. widely used vaccines uk here. addition, strategy irrelevant, given data broken partial immunity.

The main difference UK USA right USA lot unvaccinated people, ton unvaccinated elderly. making usa's severe results worse, especially south Midwest.

If Northeast testing way, it'd similar results, states release percentages vaccination rate haphazardly. popular distributed statistics taken entire population denominator, ludicrous.

Boosters *might* wane there's good reasons believe might last longer started can't much data yet. alone never enough mathematically end pandemic. 

I reacting statement above, interpreting 'vaccines alone never ended pandemic', Polio would direct rebuttal. side effects taking vaccine every 6 months though? Probably need study well husband needs cardiac MRI see damage heart, already rescheduled due staffing issues. hospital done border Idaho (we MRI machine capable type MRI live). Frustrating say least. can‚Äôt believe anyone works public wouldn‚Äôt get vaccine. Insane. UK started **June 2020** (and blew mind feel like we're second stage hitting unvaccinated getting us herd immunity phase.. I'm point lets open everything up. chose get vaccinated that's issue hospital full show up, well sorry. Numbers peaking slacking live social precautions, many people already.   addressed article itself.

""Last week, Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI) said children would receive **only marginal health benefits mass vaccination campaign consider potential benefits children‚Äôs education.""** Polio mutates, infection vaccination give lifetime immunity variants. look like sort lifetime immunity covid cards.  Anything causes lasting damage, overloads hospitals, kills people mild. Also, 2 doses prevent like half cases. like 25% risk. 3 doses prevent 90% cases, so... Pfizer. gotten Moderna, currently understand data, might wait November December. 

Regardless continue follow data. Google Scholar deep dives friend. know reddit taking complaints subs peddling misinformation anti-vaccine messages? ran across one today don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs anything it.  Well somebody Pfizer probably happy. mean, even career change isn‚Äôt going help much‚Ä¶ lot decent jobs require vaccines now‚Ä¶. comments here... happened ""Trust science. Listen experts.""? ACE inhibitors affect this? I‚Äôm one due high blood pressure polycystic kidney disease. sounds like mostly sake saying we're okay get sick take resources. 

Which usually fine, I'm sure agree covid overall affects many systems. 

So pros cons sorts decisions.  they're calling ""highly effective"" 73-90% number data sources, CDC cited large study finding lower end elderly end July.

That's high booster elderly minimum justified. Booster shots save lives regular people. That's whole point conclusion. Protection severe illness remains strong protection mild disease waning. Boosters would increase latter. Side note: cotton ball diet right intentionally consuming tape worms. Cotton wearing eating. *Stick chia water.*  used like ""the freedom first (or spit) ends bridge nose"" lot think impinge anyone else's freedom want.

Context matters. Late reply, one crediting chance. really need discuss countries like US Brazil *didn't* accomplish this? mystery yet explored? 

If think something Ireland ""did right"" beyond responsible citizens, please share. - ""chance"". informed unified citizenry acting public good benefit all. really hard idea, hard accomplish. countries found reasons try. think that's makes possible deadliness go either way -- spread Covid happens well people feel sickest, die. little selection pressure virulence. Genuine question: wonder contacts lab-confirmed actually linked? Cuz otherwise could case correlation equal causation: two infected people brushing past other, actually got infections elsewhere independently, likely asymptomatic individuals. covid long asymptomatic transmission period. spends two weeks silently spreading flipping murder switch, well... guess following typical Plague Inc playbook, lol. remove peoples rights round em ready. Stupid Americans. look uk slope try This! need vaccinate world first variants arise highly unvaccinated areas. 

The vaccines amazing job keeping hospitalisations deaths low. said everyone able get vaccine wanted to, covid would major issue anymore instead become another flu heard anything regarding that, 90% eligible adults vaccinated, see little reason that... 1. people much it...some lazy said ""waiting""
2. people can't afford lose $10 month, much less $200.

But whatever gets people vaccinated good thing I‚Äôm aware, instance think it‚Äòs unlikely courts would strike down. Again, constitutional lawyer, based understand, falls within realm they‚Äôre legally able do. Thanks saving legwork! two jabs objections boosters. I'm getting every 6 months rest life though. No, no-one saying immunocompromised get boosters. general public. vaccines generally easy get Australia yet? it‚Äôs possible could become contagious less dangerous, right cannot predict chaos theory. living quite well, actually. Every day breath undamaged lungs blessing. wish blessing loved ones Jesus name amen. I‚Äôve preparing decades!  Cyrus Shahpar's in: +590K doses reported admin yesterday's total, incl. 264K newly vacc &amp; 40K add'l doses. One year ago survey indicated \~51% adults would probably/definitely get vaccinated. Today adults 1+ dose! go ‚¨ÜÔ∏èto beat Delta variant. üá∫üá∏

Only 590k new doses today...I get might weekend numbers, feel like daily vaccine numbers going back down. Maybe I'm jumping gun, really hope mean recent vaccination spike peaked...

However, second point makes feel bit optimistic. Although still got ways go getting vaccination rate up, situation better anticipated year ago. Really helps put things perspective. Uh, didn't.

We assume 1/3 also vaccinated. 10% number infected NEVER received vaccine. Thank clarification thought so. No, despite looking stylish, utterly terrible mask neither filters inhaled breath (which comes open area chin) exhaled breath (which goes everywhere especially 1-way exhalation valve). thing would work droplet splash (like sneeze guard buffet). Covid carried small respiratory droplets aerosols, would stopped mask. places mask mandate, anybody paying attention, allow suitable mask. me. feel kind caught middle. got Pfizer shots April. dont want unfairly take booster time two important people life high-risk feel like even vaxxed can't really interact confidently.  Quite easily. think 0.5% chance dying Covid, therefore see 1.2% believe vaccinated higher chance dying. understand scale shift, argue there's 1.2% death rate poked.  know?

A lot less hoped evidently. yes is? Huh wonder why? Yep I‚Äôve heard maybe final serous Covid wave. Let‚Äôs really hope is! keep wishing.  flabbergasted! üòÜ He‚Äôs expecting federal courts vacate OSHA mandate. big ""eat dinner starving kids elsewhere nothing"". going package dinner sent starving kids.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve heard reports people serious illnesses like heart attack treated. go ER something currently life threatening might waiting awhile compared somebody covid. many hospitals put holds elective surgeries procedures pandemic. Pretty par course I'm sure many excuses getting vaccine... covid got them.

Conspiracy theories seen accepted fact reality called insanity.  get vaccinated don‚Äôt to. It‚Äôs part requirement visit stay here. said, vaccines required get visa. Well, one reliable current rate essentially useless. Second, countries Europe tests extremely expensive. 

Also, take home tests administered professional nothing. obvious. production works vaccines, could *very likely* individual batches updated version using equipment without ""shutting production lines"". 

My bet want deal regulatory stuff backlash irrational antivaxers. really DeathSatan. CDC recognizes severe immediate allergic reactions vaccine ingredients vaccine contraindication recommend vaccine everyone else. course, decision make consultation doctor.  That's subversion. Identify subversion remarkably easy prove.

The problem much proving dealing power dynamic sustains disinformation propaganda. need government intervention afraid call bluffs clamp disinformation campaigns. long truth objective, misleading little stand on. we're going painful process...whether future generations. pregnant question get vaccine. Like one guy said ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt heard anyone dying vaccine know people died Covid.‚Äù think people ‚Äúit won‚Äôt happen me‚Äùattitude taking vaccine, shown time time again, young, healthy adults dying virus.  asteroid hits Earth, COVID goes extinct? :)

Anything happen, maybe I'm optimist, think would quickly come vaccines new variants (and, luck, come better treatment options too).  Paywalled: sad. tired seeing stories. Neither vaccinated.

Bill Gates discussed earlier year. Fact is, whether agree not, never change really relevant discussion. I‚Äôm hoping end year. may end disappointing myself, though. Consider yet know deadly current Covid variants long-term. news focuses death count, neglects story many Covid survivors discharged ICU face permanent disability due organ damage, lung scarring, and/or brain damage due hypoxia. 

The five-year death rate Covid complications may quite bit higher rate people die first contract it. science boosters work, vaccinating someone vaccinated works even better reduce total numbers death. policy decision whether makes sense send doses people vaccinated used boosters, send vaccinate people dose.

Policy questions thornier, different ways weigh factors traded off. Funny people wear condom avoid getting non life threating disease, wear mask public. Actually, federal government could absolutely decide require vaccination every eligible man, woman, child country, penalized harsh fine various restrictions movement. would simply take act Congress President's signature.

How long stay peak groups, long overall, whats area curve?

Sadly enough info tracking yet, little bit see showed much shorter time near peak vaccinated people, much quicker dropoff.  This. county live Georgia 27% completely vaccinated.  COVID-19 deaths also inflated.

The presented number get deaths involving Covid-19. (Example: Someone covid-19 dies car crash Covid-19 death counter +1)

In Bavaria 88% deaths due Covid-19 - 12% deaths involved Covid-19 (date report dd.mm.yyyy - 20.11.2020)

Italy similar report: 89% due Covid-19 - 11% involved Covid-19 (date report dd.mm.yyyy - 16.07.2020)

We currently around 4550000 deaths involving Covid-19 around ~4.1 million deaths due Covid-19. United States federal government enforce vaccine mandate force people vaccinate. Biden mandating work place safety org federal purse strings entirely different matter. 

Nothing political limits federal power. Can‚Äôt vaccine stupidity.  thought vaccinating got here?

Let stores mandate masking go grocery shopping without high risk exposure, etc.  variant (or likely will) completely neutralized natural antibodies, sometimes previous infected person's antibodies decline quickly always know why, people like may completely unprotected. keep antibodies, though, believe* infected [variant closer new one, better protected behave attach cells similarly body already seen prior infection.

There tons variants existence right many super similar quite gotten every number lottery ticket right earned VOI, VOC, VOHC designation. huge evolutionary balancing act determines whether one transmissible severe evasive. kills incapacitates right away probably walking coughing among community high spread, super mild hosts quietly spreading around kill many them. IMO Delta still big-bad right now. Mu interesting worth watching, still classified VOI WHO.

*I'm covid-news-nerd, covid-scientist can‚Äôt vaccinate stupidity stupid advice start small. get house brief walks. vax/mask/ outside, safest activity do. it'll good mental health.  English speaking world global internet. Australians make 7 8% much stupid bullshit Americans. Australians travel pick additional dumb ideas outside English speaking world walkabout. Americans adopt dumbest ideas idea originated. Bad ideas amplify American echo chambers awhile become big enough gain global recognition. Much less delta spike seems rage burn quickly. look chart India, slope going slope going up. Delta rages couple months, hits everybody once, calms couple months.

Just time Mu. anti maskers anti vaxxers 40 70.

This one myths die. Every reddit thread vaccines posts blaming ""boomers"". US, boomers vaccinated high rates, falls younger  65-74: 79% doses, 89% one dose
  50-64: 66% doses, 75% one dose
  40-49: 56% doses, 66% one dose
  25-39: 47% doses, 57% one dose
  18-24: 44% doses, 54% one dose
  16-17: 42% doses, 52% one dose
  12-15: 33% doses, 45% one dose

The problem *young* people, *old* people. He's trying president attracting TFG's base. anticipates '24 nom.   ...the article written two weeks ago, use date format Europe. Everything done win votes far right base '24 republican primary. Trying win thing he's trying do, Florida Floridians matter.  aim Pfizer booster try get Moderns mix &amp; match I'm sorry. people think vaccines available. get angry unvaccinated people take precautions. think people say happy home mean never step foot door. 1st shot nothing. 2nd shot nothing. 3rd. shot, 100 degree fever aches went away evening.  Gotta fear monger get sweet ad revenue first though No, Estonia. -mere toponym Estonia hydronym last time 12000 years ago, Billingen catastrophy. Nice meat you. *chomp* think schools open think wife dirty. she‚Äôs vaccinated paid testing paid for. Yes. unvaccinated sister law planning flying Florida unvaccinated 20 year old kids next week. stupidity astounding. people effectively protecting vaccinated people point keeping Delta alive.

A person infected two different strains simultaneously, no, unvaccinated nothing help. Actually, maskless behavior exhibited unvaccinated, makes scenario much plausible. vaccination rate 80%, R0 still 1, matter 7 ICU cases today, going 1000 couple months that's works.

This argument. realize Singaporeans likely ones taking precautions even restrictions lifted, right?

Also, argument literally untrue. Look UK Denmark - somehow think Singapore follow different trajectory despite similar higher vaccination rates? Thank God cannabis! Good hear others agree this. frustrating think May talking mask rollbacks, implemented June literally July started see problems approach due Delta. still many places brought back. local govts. foot already shot multiple times. anyone really think booster numbers going anywhere near number people already gotten vaccinated? dithering, shaming mandate threatening likely created whole new population anti-boosters - people vaxxed first time sick mixed messages, incorrect information elitist shaming gone last months. Seniors high risk people getting boosters probably close first second round numbers. Younger age groups probably resist boosters much higher rate see current mix populations getting vaccinated. Instructions unclear- got 3rd shot. Based things I‚Äôm seeing FDA reasons lack requirements guidance 3rd needed. Apparently fact White House got head caused two FDA approval folks retire 

Here great article linking Lancet data Same. well (probably) much less chance spreading others least 6 months. 

Give booster now.  Huh? worst state Mississippi currently 57% 12 one shot. dumb oh c'mon Atlantic

this stupid  cuz milk insurance UGHHH like paying $600 month crap countries free cheaper stuff part problem Britain enough vaccines under-40 demographic? Well really hard scientific case it, except certain people high risk scientists say case COVID-19 vaccine boosters point weak. might necessary people, could divert much-needed doses away others. 4 August, World Health Organization called moratorium boosters least end September. ‚ÄúWasting resources boosters already protected severe disease really make much sense,‚Äù says Laith Jamal Abu-Raddad, infectious-disease epidemiologist Weill Cornell Medicine‚ÄîQatar Doha. ‚ÄúDown line, probably, would need think it. really, don‚Äôt strong arguments right now.‚Äù may unclear description. mean case rate.

And mean one largest public school systems country. 200,000 students/teachers/staff. question whether want unprotected / limitation regarding go another 9 weeks.

Though 12 weeks could better long term, means whole vaccination progress would delayed least another 9 weeks, could means cases / deaths beginning year. There's one responses. can't imagine frustration county. Mine 56% I'm still mad us. defrost completely - sucks. someone walk first thing morning way covid appointments starting, turn way Moderna defrosted ready, tell we're happy give it, wait defrost. 100% people far fine wait. Maybe poorly managed defrosted supply going day punish someone trying stay healthy :( Exactly. worth largely-avoidable risk. mean good question people probably ask question least think demanding everyone wear masks.

The original idea prevent droplets leaving mouth nose getting people, like protecting people you. people think loose, paper mask goes face big gaps around protect airborne pathogen probably realistic. 99% masks people wear useless regard, especially keep taking off. real close-fitting medical mask would provide kind protection people doing. ever wondered climate change going ravage first look places insurance companies (without massive federal guarantees) stopped providing coverage. reason deny happening, plan reality it. That‚Äôs great! recovered fairly quickly! We're definitely movie, right? insane. much deadly.  Lots sick dying kids. many adults, still.  entire job use best available data forecast specific trends future. insurance companies hedge bets trends provide level coverage hopefully bankrupt them. There‚Äôs narrative pushed. Sorry getting much hate comment. friend bad reaction first Pfizer shot, medically cleared get J&amp;J second shot time later. concerns, that's something could look into. know live, doctor, could ask doctor one public vaccine tents neighborhood anyway, see recommend someone medical history. Usually they're busy gotten much weirder questions. Yeah don‚Äôt get it, feel subs filled introverts. I‚Äôve florida June, went Hawaii honey moon. I‚Äôve accepted I‚Äôll get Covid eventually, I‚Äôm okay it, vaccine highly effective severe hospitalization. get Covid it‚Äôll probably onky last days. I‚Äôm okay this, cuz I‚Äôm tired all. work company that‚Äôs large federal contractor well. Got email Friday saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre looking need update you‚Äù. We‚Äôll see happens! large portion people fully vaccinated won‚Äôt get booster time soon, approval not. large number Americans probably wouldn‚Äôt. US already excess shots stored. majority would likely cover boosters.

It‚Äôs reason health system overloaded, antivaxxers are, boosters slightly important. even mild covid sick weeks upon weeks, people need much protection get. It‚Äôs like people afford time work long.

There‚Äôs also fact lowering overall community transmission important- people won‚Äôt get vaccinated, less people able spread help healthcare system long run. Especially given Americans lack affordable healthcare all- long covid still possible breakthrough infections. That‚Äôs risk Americans afford take. submission linking msn.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* source information. time internet social media people consumed information professionally edited i.e. TV, newspaper, etc. biased way crackpot theories weeded out.

Today idiot crazy idea get thousands followers, figures way say things generate passionate response people he'll get even more. make lie whole cloth people start take fact.

Then people start distrust mainstream/reputable media crackpot becomes source information, gravitate towards friends family live misinformation bubble.

In terms emotions think lot driven politics, ""us vs. them"", preconceived biases, thinking getting inside scoop ""really"" running things. Conspiracy theories like Illuminati alien civilizations around since forever, social media given voice never had. seems expensive. get at-home tests?

We 3 year old daycare relate. 

We bunch quick antigen tests give gets sick. particularly want \*that\* family sent kid daycare COVID gulp tylenol. sick 50% time something other. point gotta go back, Papa making money watching Paw Patrol home. 

I wish everyone would get stupid vaccinations. Mee?! That's strange, I've never heard pronounced way.

Yeah know Greek letter math classes. area alternating hospitals public schools (mask mandates). They've literally judge order stop disrupting schools, still going anyway.

And course police largely far-right operating bad faith much them.   count include OSU students/faculty required? would significant chunk right there. Would consider statistic equally valid isolation statistic (since it‚Äôs precisely statistic) ‚Äî i.e. particularly valid isolation.  might delay cancel plans, they've reviewed Lancet data. might not. something else. got Moderna booster 2 Pfizer shots. Moderna reaction slightly less intense peak, lasted 1.5x long. abnormally strong reactions both. 

My mother got 3 Moderna shots, 3rd 2nd, bed day.

Her partner got 4 shots Pfizer side effects them. high risk parents lie get booster people unless approve boosters risk people. I'm obtuse. know businesses full covid.....that way avoid them. good lord wont going cali texas lol White privilege recognized health physical issues expectations. non English speaking country. still protection getting vaccine. every front line provider. need code cm....  also anti-mask think she'll go testing either. trying make personal point, care enough conversation her. doctors want start would likely help improve quality life.

But didn‚Äôt know whether laugh cry told there‚Äôs way I‚Äôd ever start covid. attitude people toward anyone that‚Äôs vulnerable.

Edit: wish luck getting vaccine. Don‚Äôt get waiting. vigilant get vaccine, bring lot relief.  Yes, ***third doses*** still priority moment. They‚Äôre highly recommended currently available immunocompromosed folks. 

Similarly, current data ***boosters*** also supports providing point, scientists working hard determine they‚Äôd useful. disagree point practice also think boosters hill cure worse disease. 

Exposure fine long spread pretty limited honestly babying anti-vax crowd stop. Whe. Triage needed others need care relegated otherwise back normal. booster vaccine helps prevent vaccinated becoming ill see purpose that. Especially systems covid hits. Yeah, uncle got breakthrough case months ago. 

He basically laid ass two weeks, beyond miserable. Took month taste smell come back, cough go away. still trouble breathing weeks. He‚Äôs finally back normal least. considered ‚Äúmild‚Äù case too.

Not able work, exercise, basically function weeks something do. probably won‚Äôt end hospital doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going gamble sick weeks. Kind like company mission statement. 

It meant something owner once, probably. that's it.  Jeff good news bad news‚Ä¶ 

So COVID. That‚Äôs bad news‚Ä¶ 

The GOOD news I‚Äôm hindsight make cancer feel like piece cake. 

Also Stick underrated sport movie. There's actual large really venomous species spiders sometimes pop crates tropical fruits grocery stores. forgot called though. Keep mind, risk inflammation teenage boys vaccine drastically lower risk inflammation natural COVID19 infection. course determining risk personal choice part data pretty clear. need specify Bronx lowest vaccination rate **in NYC.** stands, 60% population Bronx least one shot. live, Manhattan, we're 78%. We're still good overall pretty much everyone still masks up. Plus vaccination requirements indoor activities like dining such. Delta much issue here. one wants repeat Spring last year. tell option getting tested 1-2x per week also. need make major personal point it. She‚Äôs actually double vaccinated don‚Äôt know coming from. lives north east, she‚Äôs young healthy, she‚Äôs afraid covid. see side however, mom higher risk live Florida we‚Äôre asking little compromise keep us safe visits she‚Äôs fighting us hard get vaccine might provoke much immune reaction useful. means really careful around anyone likely infected. worst part unvaccinated die leave say 2 4 kids without parent, likely life insurance. Raising kids expensive especially leave behind 4 kids. got pay mortgage breadwinner usually male gone forever, screwed. Gofundme much last 18 years expenses. thing single parents file Social Security benefits children. Depending many kids, parent gets essentially child support even though small child turns 18. know socialism. That's really safety net people have. work government contractor far we've told provided finalized implementation details. guess company dark they're supposed validate employees vaccination status. employers (outside clinical healthcare), whole new ballgame. one times lives, oligarchs' interest keeping us productively working converges interest avoid hospitalization, lasting health damage, death. mean? Agreed. 10yo asthma, still want vaccine go proper approval channels. would complete disaster got approved safety markers missed. Also run risk catching covid waiting long lines get tested places. 6-10 hours estimated time local urgent cares. Free testing program denmark, one cost like 200 250 kr like 40 dollars, cheap notice inform comment may give cancer. Ugh. Fucking get vaxxed already. even 100 bucks PER SHOT. govt.  it‚Äôs worth mixed mRNA traditional shots Germany (don‚Äôt know reliable source however, getting dose AstraZeneca vaccine, adenovirus vaccine, followed mRNA vaccine. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, example, got Moderna vaccine receiving AstraZeneca vaccine. ""It's almost matter routine Germany,"" says Dr. Schaffner.  Jason Bourne making shit up?  Florida also deliberately delaying posting data I'm sure know sure case. I‚Äôm youngish healthy, I‚Äôm actively looking booster shot, becomes formally recommended required, get it. 

I feel like willingly vaccinated people position. it, looking unless particular health issues. tumor really tied invalid cell replication together.   it‚Äôs just, like, opinion man. statement *way* reasonable level-headed Reddit.   Depends kind chemo. target cancers, different ways. Generally, someone anti-androgens prostate cancer isn‚Äôt considered immunosuppressed. intended symptomatic individuals. 

I 3 boxes ordered online $22 piece CVS. 

We touchy toddler home, nasal swabbing tantamount medieval torture. much easier home drive-thru testing lane. Less scene. NZ aren‚Äôt testing enough trend covid detecting mean anything. Fair enough! Why? went concert last week 4,000 attendees. went crowded bar afterwards. required proof vaccination. 

This going last fall/winter. terms individual infection, no, big deal. However Delta highly contagious becomes numbers game. infections = severe disease death. 


Not mention Delta, transmission young kids adults quite rare. pretty common. Believe me, shot becomes available, 10yo getting it. Yes, there‚Äôs difference paying extra risk you‚Äôre knowingly taking company refusing insure all. I‚Äôm afraid slippery slope. Say, you‚Äôre nurse. me, that‚Äôs simple. you‚Äôre vaccinated, shouldn‚Äôt job. So, fire person. people could easily spread virus work environment. Fire give job someone worthy it. instead take benefits away? open gates manipulating people‚Äôs behavior good people, profits insurance companies. weak privacy laws, know life controlled Aetna/CVS.   jail cell 6x9 right? 3 larger dimensions jail cell. I've always referred ""covid bubble"".  agressively lately.  gonna FloridaMan FloridaMenLess. Yeah teach rich suburban school. kind good lacrosse team 97% college readiness rate. literally neighborhood, commercial center, million dollar homes. several schools saw tragedy similarly posh suburban. like school extra secure metal detectors etc. used open campus years ago started fenced etc. think part problem United States comes fact people lost trust American institutions held high regard. *no one* trusted voice, *anyone* trusted voice. Fool agree completely. really pay much attention covid point. wish people would same. find stubborn people Reddit. finding spending time away bat area reddit actually best solution. Normally noted centimeters. tumors measured 9x12 inches would death sentence. crowd may confused, science not. [Boosters raise immunity course, we're running phase 3 trials real-world data hopelessly confounded, waiting actual efficacy numbers gonna bad time. No, don‚Äôt. Exactly. Here's quote:
*""My dance Covid makes cancer look like piece cake,"" added.* walk in. aren‚Äôt actually asking needing proof immunocompromised. pharmacies don‚Äôt care aren‚Äôt anyways- excess doses, you‚Äôd like booster, they‚Äôll give you. God, drink enough either sides planet it‚Äôs suddenly Friday Covid ends?!"
