0,2020-09-23," No. It’s 98-99% covid. covid numbers probably less accurate. excess deaths attributed drug overdoses, suicides, missed treatment, Alzheimer’s stress related deaths. Also remember lot people died covid would died flu year anyways. “the type socialism” 

oh yeah forgot brand socialism sanctions guess Oklahoma OK. person says everyone jump brooklyn bridge, also, get hurt, feel bad laughing idiot? effective vaccine fall 2021, lucky. vaccine issue get complicated soon, drag long time. end people governments give measures people catch eventually. Lol Life without kids easy mode. saying. today's U.S. choose kids, bring lot hardship yourselves. spent 10 trillion year. Divide 330 million see much could actually applied thing. FYI - dude told Missourians open schools HARD. said get it, will, still open schools. Yeah, guy. government allow people infected virus test vaccine. mean lost count many kids I’ll see morning homeroom they’re pulled consequently quarantined fifth hour. Last week gave test three kids pulled different class periods siblings high school tested positive parents still sending siblings middle elementary schools. 32 team 125 kids quarantined they’re talking making remote option kids (not part 125 number) come back person quarter unless doctors note. know get it, I’m hoping someone l love doesn’t die. many counties, especially conservative Central Valley, refused adhere mask shutdown mandates. looked houses Fresno area May, went towns stores restaurants still open nobody wore masks. one person get face mask. simply told know COVID intention getting sick, maybe killing him. backed away muttering virus hoax, left. People like live US. get one Pool Boys popular now? counting! gonna make number really great greatest numbers ever recorded Trust know talking about. Well, consider lucky admin supports that. 

We mask mandate state. school gave parents 5 options opt child wearing mask required dr note. also decided mask mandate lifted, won’t requiring masks anyone. 
The governor stripped executive powers republican legislatures took office. it’s 30-60 day thing it’s unknown that. Jim Bunning, Paul's predecessor, probably worst. Ya'll need socialistic democracy... democrazy.

I agree, we're get fascist autocracy. country finished. follow damn train cj  Opinion != Action. 


People free *believe* whatever want, *actions* affect others consequences. interesting, get flu shot every year, years arm hurts day, sometimes enough bother working, whereas years get pain injection. think lot person giving injection. US barbaric society. thousands reinfections, unconfirmed, confirming tricky. know two cases myself, high-risk, high-exposure jobs. FYI - dude told Missourians open schools HARD. said get it, will, still open schools. Yeah, guy. us read news Europe.

Then know Swedes produced lot deaths even excuses.

Our excess mortality far actually average past 5 neighbors greatly outperformed you.

It's race competition. glad Nordic siblings managed get away deaths, them. (And yes, lock down.)

Except actually learning us experts praising us. fuck places admit that, we're delusional, comes controlling spread pandemic general, pretty decent job, graphs lie. (and besides weeks Denmark, really lockdown us, I'm still waiting provide measures took differently actually significant effect). grateful Fauci draw attention it. Trump also found Dr. Scott Atlas. He's radiologist, plays epidemiologist TrumpLand.  true though. Hospitalizations positivity ticked recent days. really expect anything else? ...or parents.  docs.google.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, figured homie. *\[schadenfreude intensifies\]* I’m sure didn’t realize meant puppet replace Fauci. didn’t play along well enough, found new puppet Atlas. Atlas doesn’t work out, it’s going Dr Drew, Dr Oz, Dr Phil. sickos downvoting posts, why? Disagree. drug essentially performed similar Remdesivir n pill form instead IV. prescribed doctor people take something enter hospital. would first treatment kind good news. I'm going back month. First time mask drops nose I'm kicking kid enroll remote school. Staff supposedly get fired wearing improperly. supposedly plexiglass around desk. I'm glad district/principal taking seriously. month ago 420 new cases per day per million population. We're half that. know level safe suspect around 20 new cases per day per million population. anywhere close time go face face. No, isn't. Legal terms meaning. hell pay there's one hold responsible. schools can't open. Wikipedia discussion whole thing also suggests got pissed ABO newly requiring (i.e., new policy became board certified) expensive recertification every 10 years, NBO attempt something would less onerous. unethical group kids main group though, point, lot clearer looking back yeah minor issue point  catchy song: ""Corona, Corona""...... Raise hand surprised honestly funniest thing I’ve read year... sums what’s happening country... kind want gtfo.. much American pride... it’s shitter  fatalities. don’t know long term implications all. while, businesses raking literal billions. ~~lovely~~ shitty country live :/ pairs well Trump ad baseball game tonight. Welcome year long Zoom hell kids! Sigh...ok I’ll fuck wife message telling people vote considered political? Chicken egg.

Atlas influencing things, he's validate preconceived positions. incredibly viral disease prior march 2020 (in last 1-2 years) without vaccine killing infecting like covid is. Golf clap disagreed us, he's killing others politics. One side believes science data side believes conspiracy theories ""gut feelings"", reconciliation possible.  literally 2 Americas, one virus exists ever present danger another virus hoax solely designed political actors hurt administration. I'm tired shithole country. Y'all think switzerland taking refugees? truly believe American politicians actually culling population broad daylight. guess popular opinion. Whatever. trust government. country. doubt would interested speaking Russian potato. guess it’s news you’re watching? They’ve talking COVID recovery POTS syndrome USA news. really vague story brother 30, preexisting conditions, perfectly healthy. works inside people’s homes installing security systems. One day decided ask home owner would okay take mask hot it’s Texas figured said alright it’s good. wrapping owner comes mentions got covid.. great. Within 2 weeks fever started dizzy spells. got Covid test came positive. wife got Hydroxychloroquine brother thought would help (he’s super trump think thought miracle drug) took medication didn’t help. remained ill weeks. feeling better returned hospital dizzy spells going away shakes hands. doctor told 1 3 experiencing type long term effects covid brothers case he’s neurological issue now. cure him, there’s medication gave feel better. currently cannot drive car without feeling faint. weird interesting trigger also music. said listens music begins feel like it’s much start feel like he’s going pass out. don’t believe people lives forever changed downvotes know are.

Exactly this. Imagine gaining minor infamy bs-ing sub respiratory illness immediately collapsing cringe.

It's whole personality some. I'm waiting day aliens come wipe us out. Humans deserve live planet.  It’s nobody state knows wear it. “Wait, mean cover whole nose?” *Yes do, fucking idiot.* still vote lieutenant governor easily (53% 42%).

For know, original governor (we might better now): OK. asserting considered unethical “do trials anyone 18”. article explains, considered unethical conduct trials children; it’s determine if, dose, vaccines medicines appropriate children. probably 98% - 99% covid. Hence referred ""excess deaths"". wait till flu season... Lol, wtf? plainly wrong. Go look CDC site now. CDC added week excess deaths August 29 shot well expected death toll. even objective argument made here. flat wrong. see CDC site. delay reporting misrepresentated. Well need find another way pandemic say Dunning-Krugered stepped specialty.  think typically happens likely get it, do. immune longer spread it. Positivity rates go down. lot people still working, schools still mostly distance learning. herd immunity right yet. returned pre pandemic living across nation, outbreaks would widespread. infuriating part job hearing people talk Hygiene Theater great people take masks work they’re close anybody. work school. People fallen Hygiene Theater. thing social safety net tin common socialism first two syllables. please stop using far right's erroneous delusion terms describe reasonable policy issues? He’s saying op obsessed reinfection rarely happens, true far Kids never danger pandemic honestly, parents teachers access vaccine, would wait vaccinating kiddos virus isnt deadly enough realize safety != efficacy?

I inject normal saline, nearly 100% safe 0% effective vaccinating coronavirus.

safety minimal benchmark pharmaceutical achieving. otherwise still viable option. graduated HS 1991 absolutely right.

I don’t know what’s worse, feeling case weren’t old enough understand full implications time, adult knowing full well implications.

Don’t ask think little kids climate change days. Even HS kids like, “How supposed retire?” I’m thinking, retire? Let’s see live see 40. Came point out. Choice often work maintain precarious paycheck paycheck reality keep family alive roll dice kid mates okay...or risk (if even choice taking work all, many many many workers dont get PTO sick days rely daily temperment bosses).

I missed one day work last month fucked entire budget month put behind 8ball one, ripples sons bday Christmas behind it. 22% isn’t herd immunity, we’ve seen NYC (which since April), it’s enough herd resistance make virus inconsequential. They’ve reopened people flooding parks streets busy activity, yet cases remain ridiculously low. someone living city tell aren’t anything magical social distancing wise rest country isn’t. anything we’re apathetic virus ever. difference already spiked. Technically, voted Lt Gov. understand getting at, voted job got now.

To dismay many Missouri resident (myself included). Yes sucks needs changed. Nonetheless

#**DON'T SEND LITTLE SEMEN-EGG FUSION SCHOOL SICK , WELL EVER, ESPECIALLY PANDEMIC**

Lose days salary eat beans rice next two weeks to, spread virus. don’t either. want see millions adults tolerate vaccine start giving children. Technically, voted Lt Gov. understand getting at, voted job got now.

To dismay many Missouri resident (myself included).  HA HA dumb ass sensible laws paid sick leave, happen.

The parents necessarily bad people, could trying hang job make next paycheck. Ah right. ""Big boy"" jobs require risk others lives afford basic things provided citizens countries around world. solved problems! 3 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday. TLDR: 7 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 20 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Translation:

From National Health Commission China, yesterday 23/09/2020 00:00 - 24:00 , 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 7 new confirmed cases COVID-19, imported (Liaoning 2, Shanghai 2, Jiangsu 1, Guangdong 1, Shaanxi 1) . new deaths, new suspected cases.

Let bodies Footnote - Trumps superspreader events Missouri resident say . . . Good. terrible response! course getting COVID doesn’t guarantee die, possibility, however small, could happen. anyone subjected chances don’t give damn? Behavior like irresponsible, anti social, criminal! Fuck wrong society people think okay this? drunk driving car doesn’t mean cause accident, valid excuse it? society throw bone tell it’s cool worry it? No, won’t! won’t it’s unbelievably dangerous! potential damage spreading COVID might cause immeasurable. Dozens dozens, even hundreds potentially could die someone doesn’t give damn. way schools reopen year shit continues needless say suffer Unlikely symptoms immediately. state country rn sad

People cannot afford stay home/keep kids home end spreading virus more. mention anti masker fiasco Everytime see two bit ophthalmologist talk, yearn guy French Canadian name start beefing yard waste.

This fair fight Paul goes pretty much anyone, never mind someone like fauci.

Fauci fed lunch, again. It’s crazy. best example states reporting cases. posts get upvoted ones reporting large increases state levels declines never see daily case count posts state. Ya hate see sucks morons like Paul get bask illusion belong conversation, Rand Paul's opinion important Fauci's. America one biggest hypocrites family values based society. none norms values family. always have.

It doesnt help illness shares symptoms every common illness known man. 
 district sending kids home two weeks go nurse headache. 

The problem doctors blowing off. Sent kiddo dr congested coughing nonstop diagnosis ""sinus infection"". didnt even test covid. Society also help people don’t want help themselves. build rehab mental health centers won’t. someone doesn’t want help, seek out. force help them, won’t take seriously. CDC known best world. truly extraordinary made early mistakes obviously became compromised. You’re right. looking numbers posted sun- tues week, hadnt compared today’s. They’re 4x testing, 7x. keep getting better keep getting worse testing. posted new cases though sure running fraction tests.


*California* |Sunday-Tuesday week **460,187 tests - 10,189 new positives reported**

*Texas*    | Sunday-Tuesday week **104,858 tests - 30,319 new positives reported**

Source : covidtrackingproject.com Glad liked it! Another mind proves wisdom natural selection. California Texas nearly identical total deaths going back least two months. California's population 39 million substantially larger 29 million Texas. California 25th place deaths per capita states (DC state) Texas 17th. PCR test indicate active infection. simply detects RNA. viral tests confirm active infection. Home Nard Dog disability paid regular wage like 70%? think step 1 GOP's solution fix Medicare SS. ""ok, buddy"" civil discourse. SomeBAHdy make money ;) religion business. actually petty close bottom.

Well, shit comes from. Canada use 45 amplifications cycles determine positive? PCR tests use 25-30, using 35 USA criticized overly sensitive. 45, could probably banana test positive.  Yeah wipe everything case. fact, one new study found half COVID patients failed report close contacts testing positive. 

Saved click. “Respectfully” Come Kentucky, get shit together vote nuts office. herd immunity threshold calculated based R0. I'm sure get complex [this covers basic math. virus R0 18 higher herd immunity threshold one R0 3. 80%, R0 5. might fairly rare new virus much higher basic reproduction number 5, that's statistical guess. 

The basic idea herd immunity enough people immune lower current reproduction number, R, 1, less people every generation infected disease die out. depends heavily contagious virus initially there's initial resistance infection population. That's R0 captures--the initial reproduction number anyone infected taking particular precautions. failed report close contacts testing positive. (Clicked you) quote Barry Goldwater:

""Mark word, preachers get control [Republican] party, they're sure trying so, going terrible damn problem. Frankly, people frighten me. Politics governing demand compromise. Christians believe acting name God, can't compromise. know, I've tried deal them.”

Fuck failed country. Dr. Jan Itor According Texas tested 214,000 people per million California tested 350,000 per million. gap, definitely 7 times. Testing US actually quite even. difference top (Rhode Island, 667,000) bottom (Colorado, 147,000) states even 4:1. NYC close million people 65. even close. pillow You’d think tuition expensive parents high paid professional jobs. parent question banker something. could stayed home lol ignore people. Many want excuse stay holed room playing video games another year. It’s Wednesday 1. competition.
2. Sweden's economy mostly export-based. locked down, economy would worse, better. ""Parents need childcare keep jobs."" exactly mean? federal administration botched testing let spread silently vulnerable populations. California beat Texas days. We’re number one, we’re number one. 
I’d rather weren’t course 

As today it’s climbed 15,204. Doctors hate it!

Aren't tabloid headlines fun? balls men:

1. Paul = none.  
2. Faucci = biggest recent US history.

Fact. Rand, doctor telling fauci, doctor look science data doctor medical field 40 plus years =\ it’s like amateur fighting professional 6 time champion,
Not even match. NY allowed gyms reopen masks times, gym anyone near rule. I’d love read recommendations though, remember reading might make things little harder nothing dangerous. Anecdotally, I’ve work running cycling long distance well many people know without issues. 

If gym didn’t rule I’d avoid it, rule limited capacity makes feel better going back gets colder. Exactly. like water. drink water. there's lot water I'd never drink.  We’re talking guy thought could stop airborne virus shutting airports, right? default state Americans; know. With, like.... aid programs publicly beneficial usage tax dollars? Whats even worse stupid Pauls base is. Right spewing said cant grasp basics science. Rand knows continues pattern. Overall population also quarter today meaning people likely spread average theory probably would spread slower. think difficult argue 40x many would died one quarter population.

I mind people speculating, least state assumptions making come number. seems like 40 million completely pulled nowhere.  fair Rand Paul also graduated med school even right wing douche  yet defunded constantly fucked reason :( Sweet. He'll turn cheek call dibs! Numbers Texas found (scroll bar getting 3,000-4,000 cases day, peak 10,000. Numbers seemed flattened current levels though. Deaths likewise fallen 250 per day late July / early August 100 per day now.

Texas California take second third place total deaths end next week. True, also love dirt cheap child care legitimate virus, body reject it. Beer? drink many beers immune hurt? OK I'm thanks dokker! feel like it’s proper etiquette wear mask out. Kinda says give fuck fellow community members. 

Just $.02. DM youre aircraft maintenance. daughter second grade came home today sneezing, congested, small dry cough. wear masks everywhere, got bit nervous. fever yet. allergies. one else cold; sister also goes school.

At point consider getting tested? still answer question. going anything not? Medicinal meth? Uhh I'm in? Went gym yesterday evening, joke first time going outside since March (to actually stuff). Woke morning sore throat today. hyper paranoid could really unlucky? forbidden truth. must unknow immediately. got dibs left cheek. shut school parents' gotta take work anyway, parents. disagree all. definitely worse peak. Hopefully things keep improving us California. Man would nice leadership like usa he’s ophthalmologist!

Were thinking better say save PPE doctors nurses handle mistrust later would bring initial spread down?

Also, everyone saying begining nothing worry about, obvious even airborne virus? Trump briefed early February. believe governments too. concpiracy theorist, happened. Stop spending time waffle house, whore... Well know infected kids become super spreaders, especially parents grandparents. care getting parents grandparents sick - something unphases current president - could let kids go school, get sick, make teachers teach virtually (although work well younger kids, eg elementary preschool). want understand Sweden higher deaths Nordic countries, [watch I'd rather take Chinese vaccine USA big pharma profit vaxx.

I'm going take wild guess assume user talking probably socialise much begin with. they're really going understand people socialise part lifestyle.

It's common trend Reddit. Reddit everything pretty much anti-Trump, pro-lockdown, mindless consumerism real world far average people. trust? anything considered trashy relative administration give autism? /s There’s reason assume wouldn’t alleviate time, myocardial inflammation often it’s caused every virus existence. There’s reason assume different. Numba Forced sterilization people US concentration camps response Uighur concentration camps response China vaccine COVID?

It's called aboutism-ception hypocrisy US neo-Nazi right. compare 1910. travel 2020.? Really? are. months long process normal circumstances. likely move month. everyone god damn sucker reddit testing Germany, France, Italy? bought n95s (not kn95 actual n95s) Hong Kong fda approved. Innonix makes them. FDA even gave category mask deactivates bacteria virus surface minute (good case tpuch front mask accident)

Problem ike $10 pop one day use only. Hospitals profit wont buy instead get shittiest cheapest mask buy tell reuse it.. worked hospital Id 100% use innonix respokares...but $10 pop bit steep 5 mins grocery store LUIGI Right, forgot people never traveled 1910, mean could without things like cars trains, right? yes, brother-in-law see huge difference Italy come France live (then schools reopened precautions like France maybe rot like say completely silly), behavior mayors local authorities.

Yesterday late decisions government, mayors Paris Marseille tweeted level ""I'm fifteen"" (I want comment that). Italy mayors prefects etc still live (also Facebook) convincing citizens follow indications health authorities ways answer questions.

There also mayors raised controversy smashed mass media authorities threatened cut funds. sure downvoted. Especially younger ones ""552 volunteers aged 3 17 years"" unable consent yet reached minimum age consent. NYCer. group 10 (observed Midtown), 8 wearing masks 5 wearing correctly, would bet significantly higher rate anywhere else US. 

Huge portion workforce longer come office. Check local health authority. Mine says something along lines sex something don’t want discourage even it’s people outside bubble, want people make sure neither partner symptoms consider refraining kissing (which silly ask, they’re telling us can’t it). 

But yeah. Check health authority.  Hey talk shit montana... wait nobody taking virus serious... may point sir tomato tomato Somehow fuckin comedian night show host tells , pink fly, Friday funeral jumped top apartment complex.

I see you’ve given randomly generating sentences now. Thanks taking defeat well, good night baby &lt;3 Stick peepers, Rand. stupidity shows often enough. love irony. That's hypothetical outer limit bunch stuff can't happen like 100% saturation, vaccine, organic resistance. get high.

But yeah, bad. knew China quarantined billion people once. Wisconsin country? incredibly pointless comparisons. Germany literally different nation -- WW2 Nazi Germany reformed Federal Republic Germany German Democratic Republic.

And yes, African nations exploited taking debt China, ends China grabbing ports whatnot financed, end 38 million Africans displaced thanks America bombing hell. cruising? Shut.the.fuck.up. 

Really guys? Ain't got rid yet baby! Throw something else! said Paul less authoritative he's eye specialist, said Bill gates authoritative, though Gates kind MD. What? Rand Paul science back said? Really? listening medical practitioners again? Even take consideration, still got 5 yrs current social distancing get herd immunity. $21T economy based consumer spending leveraged financial markets can't survive months, much less several years.

Computations:

Take true mortality rate - 0.65%\*\* - multiply 100 divided number U.S. Covid-19 deaths, best estimate true number infected persons U.S.:  30.9 million

Apply number deaths month ago see 3.7 million infections per month. Divide US population (\~350 million) get 93 months 7.8 years social distancing entire population infected. really care herd immunity 70% (245 million Americans), 65 months 5.4 years social distancing required.

\*\*South Korea exhaustive testing early pandemic, also one best healthcare systems world. data showed mortality rate live Vermont like whole time, Fauci gave us highest praise, what's going rest country oh bb doin? mean hold China accountable it...and US negligent. knew January shrugged off. would’ve shut borders, rest world follows, whole different place. little thing called travel another little thing called Tedros saying ok long. Check numbers people travelling since January WWI theory people moving around falls straight away. Jesus. 2 million dead. Rand Paul’s douche ICU won’t change mind all. Hate say death may even change mind either big brother invading mah privacy!! it’s Reddit likes lol. None okay. one gathering like it’s good it’s something someone else believes in. pretty common. heard parents say allow underage drinking drink control get college. sure good idea not, however ask Africans currently exploited China opinions nah? D.u.h. Yeah probably doesn’t suit narrative doom gloom sub don’t wish die does, definitely won’t upset may feel joy irony. heard NPR 90% NY skyscrapers empty rn one working Absolutely. Inside masks? 20 minutes would low chance getting it. answer sure similar anecdote. caught early. Full symptoms. Wife didn’t symptoms. got antibody tests. tested positive, negative. clue came without catching it. zero social distancing mask wearing caught February nobody knew community transmission happening. writes headlines?

Cmon, really, Bird tested positive singing click bait nature lovers. need pay journalists more. Isnt dead. Nice whataboutism People rioting,looting, buring buildings 3 months one cared that. fact practically encouraged.

But trick treating problem? meant right now. per capita. Vietnam authoritarian government, definitely yes. dictatorship, meh, really depends dictatorship means. 1 party, party strictly mean follow old ideologies. means you, certain degree, politics. party become politics itself. believe multi-party system required separation power satisfied. said, party, power separation called ""wings"" keep others check. Testing usually falls 10,000. Testing rate sitting 9-10% weeks. Every then, creeps 10%. Opening like this, wouldn’t surprising numbers rise bit soon after. What’s point? mother always said can't say anything nice, say anything all. 

But damn sore biting cheek days. kidding. New Hampshire looks like great place live work. one ""conservative"" places north east right? comments virus ""slowing down"" cases climb deaths? herd immunity Spain? FlU No, really? shocker. Universities play game.

They call ""messaging campaign"" Resorts open Arizona! Come down! Full flights last couple months everything open again! Nothing compared bush administration sounds right. people Chinese family members. would add Serbia, weapon called ""usrana motka"" free translation ""shitty poll stick"", used expression show much someone pissed off. means want beat crap you, shit stick prior beating. 

There go, would ask usrana motka Serbia. Brothers, sisters, everybody sing Dr. Fauci ignorantly following proceedings. Sen Rand Paul listening hearing clearly. Dr. Fauci answer question. hundred people allowed practice faith, thousand people allowed protest. simple!
Sen. Paul wanted specific answer, Dr. Fauci playing game would expect Mafia witness. Psst... google ""stop spread"" see authoritative sites come up. **technically** gas called steam vapor solid called ice. **technically** water actually wet since steam ice wet.

\-Practicing make frontpage /r/iamverysmart back. He's dead! Windows, Bill. wish could downvote twice. understand basic epidemiological terms. No, made responsible Death, us conscience. don’t think issue requires lying about. fuck viral outbreak become politicized?? It’s least political thing world. Even entertaining type talk moronic. laughed room would. greedy? never gave money? Money.

And anyone pretends something 'unethical' stood gain millions, army people standing behind coming reasons ok - plain kidding themselves. (Not directed you) No, idiots wearing masks, freedom bs travel worse 1918. population much bigger now. Honestly, see point even, great spreading virus. Yea US freedom speech claim covid hoax masks help. There's much freedom president get away telling people drink bleach without consequences. Freedom ftw!!! politics use be, wittier. airport slots

Airport slots would arrival departure airports. case returning back airport. flight code may same. Yeah, that's triple practice means R0 cant go 1 specific geographic area exponential growth wont occur.

Sweden shut borders non-EU residents. one enter EU Sweden. still work home recommendations strict social distancing guidelines.

Why think restrictions despite 'herd immunity' mean ""couldnt worked US""? course could have.

The success Sweden's, certainly Nordic countries post-lockdown, strategy relies socially responsible cohesive population. think we've seen enough president know that's case. first thought! Rand saying bull shit, obviously since started

Let's compare mask/indoor business compliance NY home state, lol difference education camps China created extremist terrorists literally butchering people streets murdering Chinese citizens Muslims share twisted beliefs. US sterilizing immigrant women skin different color. Learn difference. Belgium eases measures now, long hospitalizations numbers rise. lot infected, lot test made days... yesterday, 505 person hospital bed due Covid19, 94 among special care. that's roughly 1 100.000. comparing different countries. can't *just* compare Sweden neighbours, that's ridiculous. People keep bringing 13th deaths world, that's misleading. That's all. 


5th September, Excess 266900, Covid 188349, Gap 78500, gives 30% missed cases. concur! didnt vote time around certainly appreciate leadership throughout mess 😫

Stay safe! might want read outcomes spectacular feats took on. Success would type windows open every day I’m ventilating apartment. live top floor I’m walking downstairs open windows stairwell 😂 I’m sure neighbors must think hell always opening windows 😂
I’m super careful disinfectant that’s use diluted diluted water mixed washing liquid create chlorine gas. rinse cold water.
Clorox truly effective cold water many people know this.
But you’re Germany read current guidelines ECDC live EU covered rules Germany recommend usage disinfectants. Chlorine, alcohol gel 60% soap effective way disarming virus.
Soap I’m sure know breaks outer layer corona cell therefore renders cell useless. It’s deactivating actual virus safest way possible. Honestly, Chinese perspective, kind weird. immune longer spread it. 

I've listening Week Virology, tell, expect vaccine decrease symptoms virus, even people vaccinated still able catch spread it. Yes, capital punishment selling substances people use recreationally insane. law mean law good.

So defending death penalty? Seriously? No, percentage needed herd immunity dependent lot different factors, hars calculate. also important note percentage probably lower immunity gained natural spread, spreads heterogenously population. spread random (as opposed e.g. immunity vaccination), contact people likely spread further, gain immunity fast.

And also different lot countries/populations due cultural, socioeconomic differences. degree immunity helps keep spread down, combined restrictions even less immunity needed control virus.

So point suggested number, especially laymen especially taking things account, pure speculation. matter 20% 70% blurted out.

With said, think actively pursuing herd immunity infection stupid idea. Oh no







Anyway scary (Typed 16.000€ Swiss made Rolex GMT Master-II BLRO left wrist) Back Netscape Navigator? got China confused Taiwan. Taiwan one open competitive ( even vicious) news media environment world , several main stream outlets itching tore current administration given half chance. notable local case going , would reported already. would way keep news Clearly know nothing Rand Paul literally doctor People would rather defend drug dealers. brainwashing horrifying. Brotherhood Nod? never lockdown March started watching documentaries Spanish flu surprisingly even symptoms similar.
So non scientist (I failed science high school) discussed friends didn’t believe me. saying similar waves like Spanish flu long drawn process.
What found sad interesting anti maskers 1918 forced Governments end lockdowns quarantines early caused second wave kill millions.
So many millions don’t know true figure many Governments actually hid numbers due First World War happening didn’t want risk dealing huge wave public outrage deaths war deaths home pandemic.

Sadly seem going way second wave like Spanish Flu ( didn’t originate Spain flu) first third waves far less comparison second presume many Governments looking current science plus history behaviour last major international pandemic caused millions deaths worldwide 1918/1919 area mask usage definitely lot 13% period time, area one six pulled this.

This part little weird perceived 36% chance getting seriously ill COVID-19 23% chance dying it, 2 1%, respectively, survey researchers say although individual risk difficult calculate differences people's choices social distance, wear protection pre-existing conditions, overestimation COVID-19 risks.

I guess result nonstop media fear spam. 36% chance severe illness 23% chance death straight multiple orders magnitude average person leaving house morning. intending get vaccine decreased 54 46% first second survey.

Pretty unfortunate there. People getting less confident vaccine time, really confident leaders fucking badly. watch either. One problem comparing deaths cases, depends much testing. test more, find cases. spring general lack testing. 


E.g. look Spain's number tests: 


Spain testing 8-10 times April. might 1 1 relation sure depending number tests. +10k cases Spain today compare +10k new cases April. 


That said. still deaths vs cases curves might match correct number tests, believe less deaths per cases spring. (Better prepared, better PPE, better knowedge, etc, etc). Oh boy!

Let's start little blip bottom experts think coronavirus still much likely spread person person via respiratory droplets rather via aerosolized particles touching shared surfaces.

Drug dealers deserve death That's worrisome hear. seems like america behind general  admit, sounds diplomatic. I'll start using that. 

Kind like ""out politeness disagree statement"" (used Polish language) thing note doctors learn thing. get basics go specialties.

Notice: one discussing salient point prior immunity coronavirus. 

Not one.

Point made. Kentucky worst state? Yes thankfully! could disaster. Imagine would happened. Nah, it’s going like Homefront, except instead fighting North Korea, it’ll fighting regime brought Trump backing Russia. 

Sadly, likely since Trump Putin would happy nuke country offers help resistance, doubt country would openly risk ending world struggles within third world country. 581 vs 623 still much different. people get name calling adversaries get butt hurt turned around them. would loudly clutch pearls. r/inflamedloins

r/inflamedlions get bored developing software something? never shuts Covid believe random Redditor, experts experience knowledge situation.  article describes 22 people working now, examples describe. It’s sobering. kind leaders Spain? lowest I've seen 3 months longest years thing government even common people know country wont last long virus way us imposed strict measures combat it. Even biggest hospitals cant compared hospital ship New York. dont anything similar state hospitals, even giant malls big. pandemic managed spread everywhere Vietnam like US, toasted.

At first, thought virus trivial announced hundred Chinese infected. then, announced China lock Wuhan, literally jumped chair called parents stock masks, sanitizers gloves. know China ""do"" thing, know absolutely insane China lock whole city like that. something dramatically cant keep control.   mean- hometown less 50 cases opened school four weeks ago. % positive floated around 3%, 0% first week school. 

Since then, % positive 15%, 18%, 23% total cases gone well 100. 

It obviously spreads schools lol. Thanks sharing. scratches surface many workers entertainment industry currently work, including myself. Think touring industry. Nick Cave tour would employed hundreds. lot people don’t realize much work goes national tour. 

Everything bus driver, riggers, stage production, catering, ticketing, promotions. devastated.

I'm really happy Swedish Public Health Agency higher standard evidence recommending population wide action have. None articles even brought displacement effects mask wearing people would otherwise stay home might erroneously start going masks on. one simplest levels deepened analysis move *""Does masks lower droplet rate?""* *""Is good policy entire population nation?""*. Canada needs take virus seriously think im defending US? Stop gulping propaganda start think bit. I’ve seen thought least 3 months. need top class called doctor So, explain comment? live one largest metropolitan areas world.

But yeah, that’s totally worse millions men world living squalor months end sending back came from, whilst making virtually effort contain pandemic don’t want show hand opposition. ORANGE! know missed Fauci said could possible catch NCOV-2 eye due ACE2 receptors. certain said possible.

So COVID eye might actually thing. Orange red. efforts help others stealing corrupt asses. Italy distance learning either. US serious contact tracing given positivity rates, yet numbers stationary US shooting Spain. I'm opposed someone this, highlight real issue medical community.

Currently medical community made people must certain way. doctor agree community 99.9% current status quo disagree couple key areas, remove license going standards. means medical community could possibly wrong nothing anyone it. Fortunately seems rare.

However become wrong something stick guns it, we'd screwed.

One area improvement - local family care. Often people overeducated compared role. could potentially reduce costs medical work significantly cheaper first layer care. role normally treat simple ailments direct proper professionals. ""looks like arm broken. Get xray I'll give cast."" ""Your son ear infection. take day bottle gone."" ""You've got problem skin could number things. better speaking dermatologist. office recommend number local options.""

In opinion need alternatively certified medical professionals allows people explore alternatives care smaller scale believe would allow fluid changes medical care. New certification processes different recognized board organization would one way this. Margins slim. Chains would fire staff cover hiring multiple new employees per store No. Already sick it, soon vaccins wide spread Ill breathing air thats cold smelling breath again. Lets clear major issue CO2 emissions never suffocation slap?!  Wages dropped countless lives could saved. 

Seems like good trade off, money. Nope lethality. speak jive. Anecdotal, live south I've absolutely surprised number people complying mask mandates. definitely see people wearing masks, pretty much since mandates started, people stores visit on. working whole life public health pretty good idea. Otherwise incompetent cant assume another institution incompetent. are, compare Region Stockholm Region Skåne example, measures taken way sooner Skåne (so far) resulted death / million comparable Denmark. is, COVID-19. lousy leadership. exchange could see Fauci wanted let Loose Randy. much fuel burn Sunday drive vs much fuel fully loaded A380 burn flying 7 hours?

Don’t look me, part, look fearless leader instead. Peace!”. Yes, I’m petty. Read stop. trials even done yet, stop guessing. Actually time place friends Spain tell me, population get it. super-high mask usage throw huge parties evenings without mask.

I think significant difference aspect.

I think absolute lack contact tracing. matter 80-90% people wear masks stupid shit like that. contact tracing spread slower masks eventually get control like we're seeing.

that’s stark reality, humans morons.  I'm idiot missed first read word search ""12 months"" ""acquired"" still missed it. somehow click wrong article? Anyway, sorry. bad. Notify schools health department noted above. OP recognizes proper actions take, seriously doubt either them. 7 day average new cases Sweden rising quite bit higher neighbors Norway+Finland (who combined pop Sweden).

I never believed Sweden already achieved herd immunity, argued, holding open-minded hope possibility since case counts initially remaining low even mainland Europe soared again. evidence pretty solidly refuted now.  I'm expert, I'm guessing epidemiology 101. claim wearing face masks prevent transmission coronaviruses wearing face masks

You claimed Sweden would less cases public health agency recommended wearing face masks. want concede point make new claim that's fine. don't, claim entails evidence proving masks work intended, operating context culture, group psychology etc noticeable refuted evidence asking study done entire population Sweden

I not. I've asked studies performed population *scale* real *In sociology, population refers collection humans. Demography social science entails statistical study populations. Population, simpler terms, number people city town, region, country world; population usually determined process called census (a process collecting, analyzing, compiling publishing doesn’t 100% calculated perfectly.

Of course not, public agency democratic society legitimately take actions evidence-based. massive responsibility can't gamble degree public health entire nation. *you*, expertise within relevant scientific fields, can't imagine difference masks effect individual scale population scale, mean differences. aware ""emergent properties"", We’ve shown better alternative

Have we, reasons could possibly imagine masks behave differently mass scale?

The masks obviously behave differently. That's questioned. effects mask *usage* differ single individual lab setting nation wide population every-day life.

I guess misery loves company true saying indeed. sure guidance reading, numerous exceptions mask wearing guidelines. maintain 6' separation, need wear mask. required wear mask dining. Infants toddlers 2 required wear masks. others.

In case, setup designed enforce 6' distance speaker others room time speaking could SAFELY remove masks heard clearly.

But, go ahead keep strawman-ing safety guidelines political purposes, I'm finished feeding troll. Ah yes Greg Abboitoir opening 75% capacity definitely “genius” move. pair state lawmakers quarantined one tested positive COVID-19 another one's spouse did, announced Thursday.

State Sen. Katrina Shealy, Lexington Republican, said husband James illness. Shealy, 65, could immediately reached comment. 

""I humbly ask prayers, **my husband tested positive Coronavirus experiencing pleasant affects illness**,"" Shealy, 65, wrote. 

Also Thursday, state Rep. Brandon Newton, R-Lancaster, said social media platform wife, Allison, contracted illness 26-year-old lawmaker also ""experiencing symptoms."" kind objectivity conveniently ignore fact NY hindsight.

NY's case 1-2 weeks behind Italy, true first-hand warning world, FL TX two months get right. right one thing - newer *said* ""herd immunity"" strategy.

But *any* strategy involve taking active measures halt spread infection *by default* ""herd immunity"" strategy.

Sweden intentionally allowed COVID-19 keep spreading population. even expressly said goal *slow* spread (implying *stopping* goal). spread stopped continue herd immunity reached. That's simple fact.

Nations chose everything could *stop* spread COVID-19 (successfully not) relying herd immunity end epidemic, Sweden - whether admit not. is. like things get better. Like could help improve confidence vaccine. Also could stop govenors stupid stuff like mass gatherings. even then, feel like much done improve covid situation point late January inauguration happens. angry trump choose act knew January February. literally agree, agree college students 18-21 love party generally selfish people? Cos they're people used party partying right now.

All said immature college student probably would partied? really dont think that's ridiculous statement make lol, confusing cant wrap head around it. Brad Pitt's character harbinger doom movie, brought death destruction every place went to. Yes that’s said “FaLsE” Better closing sending little vectors home older relatives. 

You keep students campus, still online classes. two things mutually exclusive. Literally (Max Brooks book only). understand someone already exposed day day job school. seeing friends hardly big risk, especially mitigation. benefits boosting mental health.

But get it, good anti social drones like you. global economy destroyed, disproportionately negatively impacts young people. 

We’ve encouraged forced social distance, disproportionately impacts young people generally social creatures, still stage life socialization incredibly important formative (I don’t know anyone would find husband wife 2020). 

All effort suppress virus poses danger them. 

The cost mitigation borne primarily young, benefits mitigation borne primarily old. Casting young people, basically taken chin without complaint, villains story, demented. Herman cocococaine kind thing basically nothing training dog. dog could 100% accurate lab setting that's never going hold reality. Police dogs experience thing; handler always fucks up, either basically untraining dog failing recognize signals. China, Sweden,Spain,UK, Netherlands, wonder comments like here? Oh God, basically World War Z Max Brooks. lot districts, abundance precaution, let back without negative test 24 hours symptoms ten school days (two weeks) 24 hours symptoms.

So go get tested get back early, lot places, still taking forever get test results back. mention student would also need 24 hours without symptoms, without negative test. Listen one loves staying house year. one loves going school computer seeing others going eat. reason we’re we’re trying stop pandemic that’s sweeping across country. 

So whether it’s movies restaurants college parties, doesn’t matter. either don’t help keep everyone safe you’re selfish. course anything *could* happen. speculating method spread (now shifted theories) proven major source spread (outdoors non-congested areas).

The problem theory adjusting logic match it. Rather looking evidence drawing theory based (which effectiveness masks evident, aside laboratory testing direct).

You're science backwards.  worries, saw post Ortodox Jews spreading too. start headlines ""Humans spread it"". False. Ah Boris! reported /u/nythro kremlin yet, I. seem getting nosey. know 200,000 people dead right? Oh, it’s 6% dumb ass. mistake long stay safe healthy feel good! I'll still argue sample 140.000 tests pr week pretty big sample. 

So I'll cut slack argument, believe bias big enough invalidate simplistic extrapolation. Sure, upper limit, mean ""0"" anywhere near number extra positive tests Sweden would experience level testing. ""extraordinary"" claim infection rate exponential. simple maths rate. He's also DC since Regan era, so... Ok go work it. don’t see friends... mean need keep going fuck Newsmax blacklisted CNN is? agree you. I’m science teacher crazy antivax grandparents- certainly don’t trust administration vaccine. 

Cite rules guidelines want, it’s made clear don’t mean anything administration. Another virus eh... sounds awful lot like MULTIBALL MULTIBALL 100% compared what? gold standard Covid test measure tests against. PCR tests false positive false negative rates. lmao feel like i've even read exact comment thread reddit before. Good lol TFW virus unit testing There’s way identify K95 masks vs another filter type. would able identify valve, nothing mask rating. Valves real issue.

No mention k95.

There’s zero chance you’d get banned. fact think would makes think you’re equipped deal non confrontational way. said, it’s probably best wear mask don’t take issue get plane. worth second thought, are. It’s probably email got bought ticket.  True, fullon meltdonw, gotten arguments people wear masks proceed stand close employees talking them. ""Dude, believe wearing masks least respectful people share beliefs stay distanced."" never ends well. [Come man, need It’s literally insane anyone could look bad news. *share* overall cases skewing younger, means death rate cases lower, possibly much lower. There’s guarantee stay way, 100 infections, it’s better 90 30 50 30. P Asset, first paragraph quite correct. You’re right — always it’s wrong-doers headlines, meanwhile majority kids trying safely go class finish education parents paying dearly for. Thanks reminding that. nothing sweden, sweden accidentally found attached GOP propaganda, roundabout argument whatever hell US ""right"", Sweden. Even though two countries could hardly different.

No one wants see Sweden suffer, *do* want bots/trolls/propagandists shut bit. feel one relieved latter, whilst concerned former, although truth think Sweden handle well anyone here. They're well lead, told, many say. economy grind halt every summer? Parents leave kids home Everything closed trusted wear masks? I'm saying necessarily disagree this, listen arguments make mind. use tools disposal, including credibility logic come conclusion, still listen side. argument genuinely wrong, right people propagating misinformation, person internet google search assume know talking subject. misinformation extremely high hard parse subject, due new everything can't prove everything subject due many peculiarities involved. make educated guess it, based looking whatever data gather whether believe not, people sides doing. letting bias poison view it, people reasonable. kind restrictions living under? obviously US ppl going lives. Even hot zone Los Angeles real things closed commercial office spaces, indoor dining, bars, gyms &amp; sporting/entertainment/convention venues. Even outdoor amusement parks re-opening holidays. concerned weather change cause people stay indoors longer periods time

Well thats preferable freezing outside generally. 11 go. That’s right! disagree Russian agents! code name Boris. Big trouble USA cause reality TV gameshow host wants king watched TV station fluffing ass. Almost anything preventable restrict things enough. Imagine car crash fatalities we'd made speed limit 15. know virus works?

it needs host breed spread. get people together get outbreaks. pretty simple Thank much! admittedly didn’t read article, question wondering every time mentioned- I’d never understood it. One pleb less.  know. explaining OC article means headline. keep seeing much back forth Sweden can't keep straight anymore. They're anywhere near bad must something better us. friendly reminder lot states started reopening early/mid May, see big spike cases mid/late June. 

I would love us find schools spreading virus, know wouldn't. Based data? gf's school district multiple confirmed cases state-level dashboard still says district zero. Even window units. could still spreading air/sewage “Bad faith argument” seems go retort nothing substance offer. go work?

For people need work get thing called money. useful enjoy roof head hard. Also zoom friends, FaceTime, call lol like spare me

Neither replacement human contact socialising. article mentions dogs virus entry point cells (ACE2) humans do. still get it, extremely rare. Again, somebody loves/loved party, understand I'm coming from, somebody like party, relate see moron. Perspective. Yeah... People keep saying ""we vote him"" but, like, voted next line governor even like President VP ticket, literally \*did\* vote him. like ousted grietens pointed first guy walking made gov. tastes like burning/s Sure Trump awful. Can’t think governors worse cuomo. Everyone calls desantis, objective look data shows Florida’s economy much better shape far lower deaths per capita. I’m still going get hundreds downvotes saying Every single one preventable. already some. Also unusually low death count 2019, indicates they’d expected excess death year regardless. Iran never got past first wave is/was term really play since 30s though. Yet another lie, vile repugnant claim that. Reported harassment. is.

Lmao can't take phrase seriously anymore triggers laughter placebo effect political statement.

This gist it, pretty much. They're comfort blanket people feel safe whatever became political statement. Meanwhile many Nordic countries even outside sweden fine mandated masks. states without mask mandates managed okay, states managed badly. got political, needed happen. Ask doc cotton stop microscopic virus

That's reason i'm it. careful (ie kids supposed temporarily quarantined get results back going bars partying) one outcomes consign epidemiology modelers back dusty basements, forever grateful. build models living record performance I’d unemployed long time ago.

So support use empirical data model, country size UK experienced cases level. don’t think it’s unreasonable say “We make exponential graph Excel - something scale happened IRL?” Except fought two wars, occupied countries decade, ran offshore prison questionable constitutionally, created new government agencies passed incredibly intrusive legislation days worth Covid deaths. people die week last twenty years terrorist attacks. difference average person inconvenienced. Hardly, correcting you, dark time misinformation critical. People done hiding this. People stop caring facing situations can't pay bills feed family see virus really kills really old people people really bad pre-existing conditions. Many survived long term damage seems wrong. 

This restriction related immutable characteristic person, behavior. done before? closest comes might travel restrictions, even related one born, someone *is*. 

Restrictions limited behaviors: gatherings X, standing close, wearing mask, etc. 

We generally don’t single people age, race, gender, etc. good reasons. don’t like direction. 

For it’s worth, I’m 40 something. age group. Political Stunt Never wife happier kids! Nope.

You went plane pandemic. There's decent chance it.  This. takes several life cycles infection judge happening. schools opened, 3-4 weeks ago Yup. people oh population density look SF compared states. Wow. people looked post history combined makes look fairly shitty incredibly hypocritical.

But hey, least got bunch upvotes, right?  precision vs recall

This question. [They used 14 half positive half negative. far tell trained dogs using *same set samples* used test dogs.

How know dogs discriminating based coronavirus characteristic 14 individuals recognized training? 

For example, showed portraits 14 people thousands times gave reward every time picked one happened COVID-19 positive could get 100% accuracy, too. mean I'd good screening random people airport.

[Here's direct link sample Hot dog water Opening schools viable tips scales pushes Rt significantly 1. paywall didn’t answer question Criminals tried hide data stay rich. shouldve done 2 weeks ago. sad face France 10k cases per day still lax 2 key points:


1. obvious: None cities reached herd immunity.
2. recommend shelter place specific age groups. Sounds like ""protect old"" people right? Nope, places unusually large elderly population, find sheltering people 20-60 greater effect young old basic social distancing. Really? ride roller coaster home? photography home? smelling it. getting fecal matter. cloth masks effective would wearing hospitals. matter fact.. specifically told wear written caught wearing them. mask stops droplets. sneeze. often sneezing? doesn’t stop breath virus is. support science willing admit this. people actually stupid. friggin choir practice. give up. Sewage testing use months many places already. used target individuals rather find disease spreading localities unknowingly. Therefore useful situations there's lot infections.

Sewage analysis old tactic used track e.g. polio earlier. country flu season means really measures place. Seasonal Flu low R0 countries like Australia New Zealand managed like 100 times less flu deaths usual 2020 winter. seem like big restrictions me. Europe things open months, minus big venues. small number means nothing, important p value looks fine.  see ton people thread backing opinions statistics. Look first thread ""best."" may right, may wrong, they're giving here. look either drug pharmacology reference, mention blood clots heart problems. Typically, controls samples, patients. tests false positives false negatives, issue sorting clinical samples control patients +/- COVID using PCR tests.

Different group, sort thing going on: That's problem. lucky parents money send school even university.

So I'm privileged enough understand *some* basic science. 

But here, talking providing ""education"" people use Facebook sundown sunset bawl taking vaccine ""the government use spy me"". I'm assuming good chunk simply finish high school. feel best family. People going shame shit this. decision end day. fuck going prevent spread Covid attending college party? (Hint: answer not, “Wear mask”.) one giant never ending wave. Exactly. news always like 9000000000000000 new cases today think ""How many asymptomatic, many mild symptoms many hospitalized deadly"" You’ve got fight! right! party! dope. suppose depends live? state (Utah) seeing record high daily case increases spiking hospitalization numbers. Labor Day 2 weeks ago. definitely related dip Labor Day testing point. poster pointed college towns seeing spikes. least Utah, college students driving spike. got used wearing work.

The BS excuses hear wearing blows away. people sub represent smallest sliver population still want ruin whole country lockdown .0006 population died this. 

I’m staying home you’re scared vulnerable meantime rest us getting back lives. is. I’m healthcare. It’s frustrating arguing people don’t know talking parrot hear tv. want proof.

Anyone insight politics this? disagree decision. argument making. saying ""we restrict risk group"" explaining work. fault. They're unwittingly racist clue. vaccine approved europe really really hard FDA allow it. comparison valid! common cold killed frequency maybe would point, don’t faulty comparison. disease left uncheck KILL PEOPLE might kill small number people. 

You mentioned dogging questions can’t come way refute them. see dodged question, interesting! I’ll ask apparently hypocrite, gives right endanger health? Or, fuck rights trump (pun intended) mine? still symptoms? best negative test go around anyone resume normal activity. yeah opposite. PCR tests super good detecting virus- they’re even good detecting inactive virus particles (this virus seems shed lot those), also contribute false positives later stages disease.

This biggest false negative issue PCR tests, far know, simply enough testing done. get infected Tuesday, tested Wednesday don’t get results back Monday, it’s likely year say you’re negative, fact positive spreading everywhere!

But get infected Tuesday, tested lower-sensitivity cheaper faster test Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, you’ll probably show positive Thursday Friday thus much less likely spread virus. bit offtopic, think water wet. towel shower not. water towel that's wet. ""Basic science"" used tell us earth flat. 

Try keep up, please. live frustrating. said shut weeks flatten curve overload hospitals. virus extinct old wives tale. like outside, like things. hate cooped house hardly options besides parks.

Even they’ve multiple waves still, despite efforts, it’s likely they’ll more. Even New Zealand, country supposedly “eradicated” virus (according 90% people sub), still dealing it. end this. downvoted hard? pretty much hiding far... deeply hurtful abusive completely uncalled for. correcting makes angry need take breath. Well, one thing winning. living second wave. could say that's victory. People say masks work, wear mask. Thank contribution campaign el presidente. imagine much toilet paper stockpiled That's good question. disagree decision well, reasoning really questionable. disagree it, taking ""let people protect themselves"" view it, view ""lets help keep people higher risk safe.""

I completely disagree. cases spiking among certain race ethnic group would ok restrict group gathering? different? History happening watch. need keep healthy take care eachother long enough experts figure way out.  Could vaccine treatment something keeps virus infecting us first place, whatever take forever. know past 8 months felt like forever, people sick dead much longer. keeps getting pushed back back back back. live NYC we've 20 less deaths basically since July day 2 weeks ago Malls opened indoor dining open Sept 30th need temperature screening that.

&amp;#x200B;

The virus going away idk people want. said flatten curve. say stay shut coronavirus extinct. Thank you! useful! believe we’re moving towards rapid testing approach Germany October.

My understanding PCR-tests actually kind likely false negatives unlikely false positives - definition “parts virus discovered” “person may infect another people”. thank making distinction clear! ""Adults 22 behaving reasonably.""

Really? That's strange, know lot adults 22, every single one behaving far reasonably. even know young adults age range 19-21, act interns employment, somehow somehow manage responsible, understand important. 

We couple choices here, folks. target restrictions based current data, shut portion population, use scorched earth approach shut everyone. Although personally think point, going fall, strict, nationwide, several week lockdown would make sense, people keep screaming ""the economy."" best minimize transmission avoiding wholesale shutdown? user banned already? mods useless? Yeah even conflict interest look good. difficult situation really I'd imagine lot people worked industry shares pharmaceuticals. Especially president R&amp;D GSK surprised get partially paid shares. suppose advising virus etc conflict interest role deciding vaccine used would conflict interest. 

Either way looks terrible public personally blame him.  Driving crazy. technical word describe “r” “n” visually merge form “m”? tribalism. reason logic applied there. province digging deeper hole. economy diversification, polluted digs sites abandoned companies refuse clean up. good stuff.

And remember polite political discourse two way street. Oh support people forced anything. look comment history see I'm thrilled severe punishments partying college. think young people take low risk death reason disregard safety others. Even keep personally separated elderly virus travel multiple generations young people eventually get there.

My username supposed reference BTW. former roommate used wifi password reason thought cute. needed, fucking scary embarrassing. exactly America's geopolitical foes want--states distrustful one another federal government. Yeah that's pretty accurate would add we're meek B student. We're afraid assertive taking harsh actions could've helped virus contagiousness anything? sound like you’ve inducted capitalist cult. 

All need tiny hut garden live. Anything you’re putting lives danger. 

It’s capitalism made think wants worth lives others. cast off, you’re adding problem. highly evolved country like US make sweeping policy changes based *someone thinks true*. study using controlled scientific methods, wait findings analyzed published study, wait studies peer reviewed. 

Then ignore results studies based people think true pundit told so. expected. ban gathering x people alcohol consumed general. fair create laws try curb behavior endangers community. bullshit make laws apply subsets citizenry. 35 year old drinking party 20 year old drinking party exact risks regard covid. rich. That’s crazy. 

Thought I’d now. thought teachers' unions would delayed opening weeks. Good point. Since antibodies produced B cells covid specific t-cells responsible immune response thought would correlate better other. 

And better testing antibody directly? certainly expensive. I've read, cells tend less specific cross react similar coronaviruses. might helpful global population naïve SARS-CoV-2 initially though, however, remains determined. Either way, would apply populations, right? Sweden. 

T cells persistent good long-term studies immunity. antibodies deplete within ~6 months covid spreading. fact, short term antibodies higher tcells. See fig 1B. 

In either case, antibodies T-cell estimations significantly herd immunity levels. cell measurements tell optimistic story. find similar measurements populations.  Australia right idea limiting gatherings two people, curfew, limiting going hour.  Cram 'em let 'em catch it, say! 

/s obviously monster predisent would say that. idea isolating much longer going cause pain virus will, least many.

Well us might well die lifelong health issues thank brief consideration. lesson approach destined learn entirely unnecessary. vaccine comes Biden elected FDA guidelines, would take it? Dude getting ridiculous. State bankrupt, yet wants take every job federal government (or should) have. intro stats problem.

Any test 100% accuracy mind false positives. tested March husband tested recently, free. ask insurance info. 

Biggest issue waiting 2-4 days results.  heard septic system testing accurate up-to-date testing numbers, sanitation workers state officials get see data. could virus get wors... 😧😨 Average spending per student US $11K. Twenty states spend average, $20,000 per student teachers still buy supplies classes. Administrators part problem too. I'm still cleaning every damn thing bring house. Even though experts said apparently cool to, I'm struggling ease up. umpteenth time last night saw dude rip mask chin cough grocery shelves front him. that, people ignoring ""mask required"" signs stores refuse actually enforce altogether. come across every single time end somewhere someone always hacking lung. hard assume inconsiderate idiot probably left sick-juice whatever I'm buying, dammit.

Affording delivery everything got little difficult unfortunately, I'm always able let things chill days. Thus, I'm still left feeling like wipe everything down. germaphobe anyway really high gear now. alone this? Great, 1.3 million worthless pieces trash pollute planet. cracoCAINE don’t language skills make total sense this, point year isn’t over. 100% Pretty sure could close 100% accuracy guessing It’s gamble waking every morning bud. Good luck getting life outlook. Due coronavirus restrictions. Fathers aren’t allowed attend birth labour established, told leave baby born. Leaves mother labour look baby without support partner. apart using copper make brass knuckles think going help fight anything. Nail salons, restaurants, casino open city, schools playgrounds closed.

Priorities. makes sense open schools restrictions, capitalists want workers work make money home taking care kids, another invisible enemy end sight control masses like terrorism war drugs Maybe we’ll vaccine that’s effective widely distributed soon. really really hope so. that’s case retrospect Sweden probably take wrong path. think it’s honestly unlikely vaccine going great, least first one, we’re going dealing while, probably least rest next year. definitely hope I’m wrong. 

To save two dozen lives stop probably 2000-5000 infections, don’t think many clusters lead many cases. Whatever case numbers may be, Sweden hardly deaths months. 

“Needlessly sacrificed” there’s huge cost lockdowns don’t forget. Drug overdoses, suicides, missed cancer screenings, increased crime due economic downturn, etc etc adds up. I’m saying less COVID (except developing world, lockdown deaths absolute certainty exceed COVID deaths going increasingly vulnerable famine, tuberculosis, many things), needs accounted for. Apparently happened Spanish flu. Neurological symptoms people infected virus range severe, lack oxygen brain, mild, loss latter symptom may cause concern, indicate something happening beneath surface, Florey Institute researcher Leah Beauchamp explained, acute inflammation olfactory system, responsible Inflammation plays major role development neurodegenerative disease.

Please downvote post bad news. valid point, point anti-maskers, people peculiar political persuasion, adopt order keep getting people sick ""living life normally"". want get people sick, usually, like regular people want stay isolated. highly-contagious sometimes fatal virus bizarre unknown side-effects including lifetime organ damage across age groups care either. thrives transmitted, us pulling direction. They're saying sensitive promote spread. People dying etc.

When say there's going 2nd wave, that's think there's herd immunity. Thank diagnosis Dr Freud. Yeah, nothing book about. fun movie, want see movie book. [Here's rt.live's CA not.upvoted Yeah false it’s proven many times masks inhibit ability breath. Also dirty mask? Fucking wash dolt. 

Just admit you’re selfish prick don’t want put one on. Best boys rescue anything dogs can't doodoo? That's fair. different risk-levels, that's fine.

Just important give context. persistent lack ended people 20s 30s thinking they've got risk dying Covid 100x higher reality. probably combination people indoors also colder/dryer air allowing aerosols small droplets dehydrate quickly allowing virus remain airborne longer. Heaters also dry hell air used more.  still opening schools? Riiiight...or know...till thousands infected every day. Americans cant bothered protect countrymen. Yalls patriotism ends flying flag crying someone kneels anthem.

Edit:words  absolutely rocker think reached community spread could've hid bunkers (which nobody fucking has) waited out. many things require human interaction. News flash bud, could that, deal flu every single year. that's anything actually works. Wake real world, way fantasy lalaland. Nobody merit thinks could STOPPED spread.  People literally saying exact shit back June. Cases rise, hospitalization levels fine big deal right?

Then sure enough, hospitalizations started going too. Followed deaths

Seems foolish assume headed back trajectory  Effects dexamethasone modest. Reducing risk death icu cases 40% 29%. Remdesivir date failed offer increased survival rate reduced time people make stay hospital. Guidelines NIV vs. Intubation changed bit, drastically. possible benefit still quantified. Treatment got little bit better, far away game-changer.
I fear idea slim percentage severe cases progress icu-level disease die wishful thinking. I’m supporting anyway, find almost everything China morally repugnant.

However society basically back version normal. That’s meant it.

If stamp fuck monitor it, country return normal. Europe done, get multiple spikes normal lockdowns. US did, spike never ends it’s chaos.

Australia NZ done extremely well. it’s always selfish idiot breaking rules fucks everyone. everyone else acts dictates fucked gets. actually double standard exceptions rules. honest, big reason lot people taking seriously. Student parties American universities allowed, they're completely mask-less drunken . . y'know parties used - people getting COVID telling anyone getting tested ""dont' want university shut down"". (an actual scenario quote btw)

So, that's . . . that's is. we're going another . . year? long take everyone wise up? makes wonder dog would act differently around covid. stories dog owners getting checked doctors simply dog kept sniffing parts body, learn diagnosis dog sniffing cancer. Nursing home criminal negligence boosted numbers heavily. Additionally, dying “with” covid doesn’t always mean “from” covid. see RO article. IIRC something like .98 couple weeks ago 1.02 recently, since can't find source can't sure. recall us ever ""well below"" one. read search results times, actively searching month January. 

We posting search results sub google February, posted results 7 months ago. People can’t bothered doesn’t affect (those high risk groups)


They bare minimum said “I tried best”. 

Humans extremely selfish.  Alcohol! fun need activity. talking Zoom get weird awkward. Jackbox games Zoom friends week. We've also done ""homebrew"" pub trivia competitions. Using statistics provided, that's almost 10%. One ten deaths *completely preventable* reason. yet. Further, figures even take account long-term health effects survive. may find frightening tragic; many us do. Damn sounds slow, got mine day NZ pretty simple work 0.6% people virus die, need get say 50% population ill herd immunity kick in, paying 0.3% population get it.

If herd immunity happens 75% costs 0.45% population on. Online programs elementary aged kids never going developmentally appropriate.

It’s waste time resources. Ever since came quarantine june, yeah. really dropped ball  bitter shallow transparent. April 2022 baby! people deal covid conspiracy theorists work environment? 
I’m delivery driver. Deliveries take good 10-15 mins conversation customers normal often fairly lengthy.
Today, blue, customer started talking believes isn’t virus it’s designed control population, blah blah blah.

Has anyone else experienced similar? respond? Look another person reddit think they’re medical professional. know there’s long term affects covid? Lol /u/stophavinganopinion deleted comment also shit load ACE-2 receptor testicles, women obviously have. wonder men receptor anything it. think also take nose swab, make sure dog right started tests airport environment.

Somehow thought staff swabs nose dogs make sure dogs' noses get right.

Yes, understand trying say. hear 100%. quarantined pretty hard working home roughly three months. Turned many opportunities hang people terrified even pass someone hall apartment.

Now I’m back work, friend hang week although adhere pretty strongly safety precautions I’m afraid go store grab groceries even sit outdoor patio somewhere drinks food. I’m 26 year old decent health, think healthier take calculated risks maintain normalcy mental health opposed total shut in.  Downvotes what? numbers. studies shown prevalence types long term effects greater illness. Look, get reddit especially r/coronavirus want hear I've assessed risks come decision. wear mask distance whenever possible live life normally otherwise. lift 6x week run 3x week able weights bought quarantine racks weights much higher quality gym feel much happier able so. plenty people advocating disease gone, effectively forever. Poland quickly looks way.

I looking Netherlands right now. year basically loss learning anyway.

It’s nice you’re fine this, parents aren’t going accept kids losing whole year learning. Schools completely failing kids right now. learn shit ""online school?"" must going. teaching chemistry know students learning. talking learn shit, even talks way?! Installed it, simple, runs background, noticeable impact battery life. Love QR code feature well, makes much easier use system venues rather different websites every time. Hopefully it'll help bit! reinfection possible ""immune"" written ""immune*"".

We supposed civil remember. user's evidence swedes socially responsible others? Deaths lagging indicator, often long 1 month. wants protect superspreaders, low-risk 

uhhh Herd Immunity best. Well fact parents children receive shit end stick incompetence vile. Anyone know enough know can't choose get sick. tight situation I'm sure, seems get worst it. American leaders valued education military spending problem funding, we'd smarter citizens. opinion. Thanks providing link, good one keep eye on. It’s interesting point, 2/3 reinfections people 50 years old, half reinfections resulted serious illness second time. Obviously statistically significant point I’m glad someone’s tracking data. stupid logic. diseases classified 100% safe 100% lethal categories. Coronavirus lethal, especially specific communities (elderly immunocompromised), fact kill people make safe. ""not deadly"" view mean sending schoolchildren dangerous, infectious situations. diseases, deadly not, need tests see it. That's testing works. saying different include excess deaths? Specifically, here's graph article linked:  

If anything article confirms even including excess deaths, drastic difference Sweden's losses neighbors confirmed. clearly see Sweden vs. Norway Denmark. Finland included article, I've seen reports indicating Finland counted Covid-19 deaths ~10x (which would needed change main point here). source, I'd love see it. 

Edit: spelling news : water wet. news : water wet. deaths spiking *now* mean spike *later*.

A months ago, many U.S. states, including California, Texas, Arizona, seeing alarming spike cases. initial bouts reluctance, made right choice reversed reopening measures. California even went far ordering second lockdown, still lifted (rightfully so, still seeing high numbers cases deaths day, that's another story...)

Many skeptics understandably angered. wish see ""their"" movements end lockdowns return normal soon possible come sudden end. threw us wack absurd excuses disguised logical fallacies, ""herd immunity"" ""shifting goalposts"", order justify keeping states open, defiance common public health consensus places *should* reverse reopening numbers longer favor. Among excuses idea deaths rising virus already swept vulnerable population. This, reasoned, *all* places saw second surges *cases* *not* see equivalent surges *deaths*. jeered news articles political statements falsely predicted rising deaths certain timeframe, ""two weeks"".

Eventually, however, deaths *did* spike. *all three states mentioned*, surge deaths arrived *exactly* projected; mistake date. surge come, skeptics aghast, loss words. first, found *unable* explain away increase COVID deaths, even trouble thinking do. so, haughtily degraded platforms, desperately resorting various different sorts conspiracy bullshit (as dogma *weren't* conspiratorial *enough* already). insisted official statistics state government briefings websites artificially inflated retroactively listing deaths discovered fallen previous days. Others claimed death surge nothing *illusion* caused increased testing availability. Fortunately us, skeptics' arguments convincing, largely mocked sane people, including virtually governments.

Remember: matter convincing may sound you, types arguments **false**. ***Do listen them, accept fact!*** so, propagating ***misinformation***!!  stupid logic. diseases classified 100% safe 100% lethal categories. Coronavirus lethal, especially specific communities (elderly immunocompromised), fact kill people make safe. ""not deadly"" view mean sending schoolchildren dangerous, infectious situations. diseases, deadly not, need tests see it, dumbass. That's testing works. know many people could go doctor money? It’s fucking insane. knew would happen. many parents can't afford even punished taking work? grandfather getting regular medication Canada alive. got seized least once, even loss much cheaper. stupid logic. diseases classified 100% safe 100% lethal categories. Coronavirus lethal, especially specific communities (elderly immunocompromised), fact kill people make safe. ""not deadly"" view mean sending schoolchildren dangerous, infectious situations. diseases, deadly not, need tests see it, dumbass. That's testing works. however New York cannot used example 

dude literally told use NYC instead look Finland, Denmark Norway

as RP Fauci said, directly comparable USA ways. ""they did"" ""their outcomes"" directly relatable failed control Corona sees huge surge deaths due listening Fauci 

now _that_ sounds like agenda :) lol.

FFS dude - get BEST data BEST people (including Dr Fauci ONE them) make best decision time

that's do.  adjust necessary.  use DATA. Use experts. Use reason. use feelings politics, suck.

It's interesting bring mask thing, reading evidence judged ‘low certainty’, analysis found significant advantage N95 medical masks [11]. premature draw firm conclusions, results suggest contribution fine aerosolized particles infectious spread viral respiratory disease may limited.""

You're absolutely 💯 right failure leadership local, state, federal governments... shit show. offended? Ouch prosecuted. Personally I'll still wear flu season maybe spring allergies get really bad I've found wearing mask helps allergies otherwise I'm able get vaccine (assuming, course, works properly,) rest family is, I'll stop wearing mask regularly.

Good luck then. say I’m sorry. really feel teachers ever. unusual incident, don’t think there’s hard evidence suggest White House made CDC retract statement. That’s pure speculation.

Edit: Biomedical applications 
Quantitative proteomics distinct applications medical field. Especially fields drug biomarker discovery. LC-MS/MS techniques started take traditional methods like western blot ELISA due cumbersome nature labeling different separating proteins using methods global analysis protein quantification. Mass spectrometry methods sensitive difference protein structure like post-translational modification thus quantify differing modifications proteins. Quantitative proteomics circumvent issues, needing sequence information performed. Disadvantages, however, sensitivity analysis time must kept Drug discovery 
Quantitative proteomics largest applications protein target identification, protein target validation, toxicity profiling drug discovery.[21] Drug discovery used investigate protein-protein interaction and, recently, drug-small molecule interactions. Thus, shown great promise monitoring side-effects small drug-like molecules understanding efficacy therapeutic effect one drug target another.[22][23] One typical methodologies absolute protein quantification drug discovery use LC-MS/MS multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). mass spectrometry typically done triple quadrupole MS.[21] Google that.

I double check August 5th peak smaller spikes 8th 15th, overall seem right, admit numberwise mistaken.

But lower testing capacity during/after obon? What's daily average tests now? Uh, that’s kids learning home?  per capita? source that?

But surprised spectrum def gone states Viruses don’t sentience. sound like idiot.  eh thing seen california Alright! talking China Russia here. 


Sure missed cases, maybe like 20-30% cases, early hard hit states du lack tests. 


Russia instance reported less 6000 cases 30000 excess death. July alone. Areas Russia like 20 times excess deaths reported Covid-19 deaths. 


There ""number EXTREMELY suspect"". US. Backstreet's back, alright! shameful rand Paul doctor yet he's spreading anti science information. Yeah feel like schools high infection areas actually reopened so.... Skewed data? wife COVID too. 2nd Parson tested wife, Teresa, tested positive earlier day.

Yep, even posted soundbytes twitter luckily none replies fall  one time someone GOP okay using scandinavia example Sweden population inclined follow social distancing guidelines still seeing triple digit cases. sure kind herd immunity referring to. 

Also, idea could worked US many unwilling wear masks follow social distancing hilarious. Yes official narrative west. Note CDC guidelines hospitalized patients, proponents talk early stage treatment (so hospitalisation). Asian countries kept using however. Western scientific research stopped Lancet paper later retracted could guarantee validity data (in words: fabricated data). RCTs early-stage treatment say work search many state work, also scientists state jury still cancellation.

Forced normalcy still doesn’t feel normal, it. anything, kids aware adults. something different one Halloween isn’t like missing graduation, yet happened. yes, thing. forced normalcy COVID19 spreading most. someone living Madrid, know good news. think even true , since army going enforce laws crazy regional premier wants, assist tracking desinfection. 

Enforcement law mission police. Local police town (co-paid regional government municipal government) pretty much disappeared since pandemic begun. National police (dependent central government) much better. Yesterday TV showed local police Madrid city making controls buses stopping delivery workers. Maybe need engforce measures army, police fucking job instead wasting time power shows. Idiot savant r/angryupvote Centers Disease Control Prevention World Health Organization slow move away early guidance surface disinfection, towards clearer guidance preventing airborne transmission.

Smart astrophysicist somewhat moronic comes sciences attempts speak authority without understanding. Taiwan keeps 0 long time exports cases countries. guess super infection airport. fair, point 100% America genuine joke... agree, Swedish response also ""left"". 

They didnt refuse lockdown save economy. Swedish Public Health agency responsible economy, dont care economy. however responsible public health broad sense, focus coronavirus. example reason didnt shut schools lack education serious consequences long run society individual children. Increasing inequalities, child abuse, asocial behavior, decreased mental health, increased wealth gap etc.

They also used leftist methods fight virus. could locked people homes would much much cheaper, atleast short run. 

For example april highest number people ever (twice high 2019) staying home getting paid take care sick children. children sicker, guidelines says stay home slightest symtoms. Similarly government made get paid stay home youre sick before. Riskgroups gets paid stay home etc. fantasy homeless people fell hard times that, fantasy

That actually common misconception. Quoting know research Canada United States many Canadians may homelessness one time another, usually lasts short time. Many get homeless experience provisionally accommodated, is, staying friends Even consider ‘emergency sheltered’ population, majority homeless short time. reported State Homelessness Canada: 2013, **median length stay emergency shelter approximately 50 days**, people homeless less month (24-29% stay one night) generally manage leave homelessness own, usually little support (Segaert, 2012). group, considered **transitionally homeless, makes 88-94%** homeless population (Aubry al., 2013) people homelessness usually one-time smaller significant percentage population, homelessness considered problem. People considered episodically homeless (3-11% population) move homelessness, continually homeless year may experienced several previous three years. includes 6,000 22,000 individuals annually Chronically homeless refers individuals long time, potentially years. Interestingly, number homeless people Canada, percentage homeless population 2-4% considerably lower United States mental illness substance abuse

It's actually clear mental illness &amp; substance abuse cause consequence, actually. Making education affordable would good start Beady-eyed crusty boomer shitbitches gtfo Imagine family member poor soul lost.

Imagine watching mother father slowly succumb awful virus, hear death described ""a hiccup"".

I'd burn damn school assholes responsible locked inside. depravity heartless shitstains enraging. I’m epidemiologist. Italian living Netherlands see huge difference people's mentality. NL one wearing masks, cowboy mentality since beginning, claiming ""no panic"" mentality even putting italian approach stupid. Renaming lockdown ""intelligent lockdown"" almost constrast lockdowns underlying sense superiority virus affect them. Rutte trying manage outbreak ridicolous measures like asking people stadium stop chanting. yesterday's news dutch youtube influencer launchedba campaign agains antincorona measures ""people tired"". Except lie. alone thinking 20%.

Disregard whether 20% needed not, fact Rand Paul alone thinking 20% needed.

So Fauci outright lied hyperbole. It’s spreadable. He’ll fine. probably goes right heads they're morons. nazis got power. Trump trying keep. Fuck flowers. Also many Chinese men named Richard.

Source: Chinese. flu, mostly excess deaths (and statistical measures). Coronavirus, actually tested. actually underestimate Coronavirus (vs flu). article means nothing .whats control using based . Pure nonsense complaining Swedens day day update delays (think 95% reported within 10 days), Spain months behind still. Maybe businesses super useful pandemic lockdown? new cases new deaths per day numbers. Back early May numbers,  Back July numbers. call limiting size gatherings closing schools lockdown strategy Sweden long lockdown. already this. 

And lockdown strategy means shifting anything.

This headline perfect example contradiction.

Does every foreign newspaper people payroll making shit up? get it. Rand Paula asswipe worked Congress-only gym along attending meetings infected symptoms?

Rand Paul, Paul Rand, Ron Paul, Paul Ryan, Ryan Reince Priebus Collosus Fuckus. Can't keep track names behave fuckwad manner. mostly correct entirely. Testing FL 60% peak July, cases almost 80%. disparity reflected ~8% drop percent positivity they've period time.  

So basically death rate suggests decline disease nearly large looks, exist all. No, dumb griefer watched couple Tim Eric skits said ""I that"" started posting Reddit visibility likely ""Yes, still him"".

“It would go away without vaccine?” asked.

“Sure, period time,” Trump replied. “Sure, time goes away — ”

“And many deaths,” Stephanopoulos added.

Trump didn’t deny that.

No? point certification one point make kind authority matter. current certification makes authority. abuse authority, certifying organization remove invalidate certification.

I saying Rand Paul anti-vax.

That said, make comments time time imply favor vaccinations. call anti-vax Sounds strange considering live Orange County (CA) area pretty good mask wearing since recommended CDC. Even small brief period masks longer required, people still wearing them. There’s huge correlation blue areas OC mask compliance vs red areas (*ahem* yorba linda). Stop eating goddamn cocaine! Statistically that’s unlikely first place. chances surviving still 99.96% fucking moron. funny people like try tell I’m wrong Relations scientific evidence don’t even know is, Wouldn’t surprised you’ve never read CDC scientific report back back before. Yeah act like have. It’s laughable best. knew anything science would shut dumb mouth. think Covid deadly someone television said so. actually read scientist say? Scientists studying actually data support said choose ignore it? sad. You’re ruining America hate that’s truth. ignorance destroying everything family works hard for. favor read CDC scientific reports don’t get news guy takes advantage viewership income.

Eat rich shutdowns gällivare strange sounds, fires likely helped contribute low numbers. Second wave US would disastrous, baseline number way high. What’s RIP bit?  hold Bill Gates relatively high regard, Microsoft notorious monopolist 90s early 2000s. Crushing competitors dubious trade practises, patent bullying enforcing closed standards users order exclude competition. actually fined several billions stuff (among others) EU.

The situation slightly different days, lots respect Bill Gates (letting discussion billionaires existing middle here), right Microsoft exactly known nicest company there.  Barcelona calling Rand Paul anti vaxxer? Damn, burn end... loins inflamed Get Basically, infectious virus mutates less severe becomes. It’s evolution based replicating much possible killing it’s hosts. majority cases, test increased sensitivity detects person -recovering- covid think test job. 

There diagnostic value less-sensitive test detects someone recently infected still battling disease itself. someone shows hospital signs illness, helpful use test determine current active symptoms due covid. case got covid 4 weeks ago, recovered, currently suffering something else, positive covid test could cause confusion.

However, concerns 'falsely' detecting covid people trying misinform.  every anti-vaxxer got M.D. one point doctor.

There reason professionals re-certify. always worthy certification. actually Covid, tested positive missed work everything (it way less severe flu I’ll tell experience). Also like said family member died. 94 lung cancer, smoked every day, Asthma diabetes obesity Covid lung cancer. I’m sad lost grandmother certainly don’t think Covid killed 94-year-old woman underlying conditions. science CDC told us majority people dying people like grandmother old well age average life expectancy 2.6 underlying conditions average. Covid dangerous television tells is. I’m sure get everything know world television box. you’re fucking moron. Also,I survived survival rate people age 99.96% survival rate yeah survived like anybody else age. LOL fucking idiot. People want Sweden wrong badly...

Or really want us right even though country absolutely nothing like ours.

It's weird sitting seeing country used propaganda sides. wouldnt know everytime speaks canada starts french.... Rand Paul useless rat motherfucker, he's disgrace father Luckily, seem case ADE. Prevailing hypothesis low initial viral dose first infection cause patient seroconvert, higher initial viral dose second infection breaks innate immune system thus require adaptive immune response curtail. Best way explain US person similar Obama many ways. tl;dr course. Everyone understands. I’m always date vaccinations, flu shots, etc US government way currently would hard time trusting fast tracked vaccine. CDC can’t even figure believe it’s air born literally scientist writing reinfection papers saying. Basically low initial viral dose fought innate immune system, therefore people seroconvert, especially mucosal antibodies seem important sterilizing immunity.

The second case higher initial viral dose makes past innate immune system.

There sign ADE reinfections. something worried about. This, something keep eye on, something obsess worry over. death penalty drug dealers Asia. 

No death penalty dealers Americas Europe, sell people drugs tens thousands die drugs.  Maybe get covid see survive 😂 15? MAX I’ve ever “offered” stateside 5 days less half pay better able prove dying. jobs I’ve worked, particularly low wage jobs max like 3 unpaid call-outs would start getting write ups. could country force 7 days I’d ecstatic though I’m gonna hold breath. Yeah, there's way could possibly come back ever... Also would strengthen geopolitical position even Surely governments responsibility form. Nope fine way shrug somehow watch see. seems like getting vaccine ""political correct"" direction subreddit, know forums like echo chamber, minor voices get supressed getting downvoted. 

Everyone completely selfless, whether admit not. 

I afraid say agree you, anything pandemic taught personally, skeptical everything, even health authorities. Remember beginning masks recommeded? Well that's straight lie reason say general public enough N95s. Could immunity, genetic cross-immunity coronaviruses asymptomatic case had, could luck draw. Household attack rates average around 20%, even feels like sure get living together, that's case. Right went heavy lockdown first got worse worse worse got worst people going die died got better. That’s exactly point. look stupid presenting facts you? lost family member Covid don’t blame government don’t blame anything blame Covid virus one control over. soggy mask design sawdust says box never designed viruses way. government government mandated mask tails, technically could put wet used shit covered underwear face would allow walk supermarket buy food. sound like science you? hope isn’t. think best way control handle situation rip Band-Aid slowly we’ve seen personal experience scientific documents allowing virus it’s thing disappear faster rather allowing pockets continue survive there. 1. They'd quite like reopen borders point future, without prohibitive quarantines;
2. Even zero community cases now, rare case could incubate beyond quarantine period, someone could enter illegally, could animal-human transmission, potentially even disease could transmitted frozen food, etc. outbreak via method caught, they're virtually back square one;
3. Developing selling vaccine developing world great way project soft power, especially west preoccupied protecting population first.

So yeah, apart three compelling reasons... would need it? opinion this:

We organisation elder care little medical training among staff management. people making correct decisions regarding infectious decease going work well. 

The organisation elder care normal health care, staff management properly trained.

As population nursing homes old weak cannot live homes anymore, considered healthy. Instead considered sick care health professionals. Well, makes mess. don’t recommend throwing spaghetti wall. Ditto Mac Cheese, dishes, honey, maple syrup. SINCLAIR, Upton, born 1878, American novelist social reformer:  
""It difficult get man understand something salary depends upon understanding it."" COVID-19 cases spiked recent days, average 1123 new cases reported daily past week Likewise live here, people government even got around saying wear masks amount mask wearers increasing handwashing stations outside shops already started.

Like **elect** fucking unqualified **idiot** **POTUS** so? loved uneducated though. UK ITALY SPAIN MEXICO BELGIUM guess u find data ambiguousthan comparing Usa Sweden ;) Nah, gotta much games possible close pubs altogether hit us another lockdown, unfortunately unrealistic all. royally screwed. 

Others know odds, go inside well... I'm guessing US, attitude definitely reason we've much trouble. Even children experience fewer bad outcomes virus, probably spread virus easily adults given way children interact world. lots children sick likely spread virus individuals experience much worse outcomes even individuals thought healthy.

Plus whole getting tired coworkers fucking around virtual learning...I've worked two different jobs since pandemic began interacted parents struggling. times like supposed come together help one another. boss jobs significant issues trying attend kids, I'm still fine patient them. whole fucking world dealing something we've never experienced course issues distance learning figure out. 4 years progress! data skewed, due lack testing, lacking f2f many districts, lack reporting. guy called temporary covid travel ban ""xenophobic"" later said done soon enough. He's shit case count studies flawed way, ifr higher estimating...my personal expectation. FINALLY!! trump fans... that's different story. gullible get whole idea. Sweden better UK,SPAIN, BELGIUM, NEW YORK, Italy Mexico... name can't read article, however title, 5% (of total population) vaccine side effects much 1% (of infected people subset total population) virus kills. news today 6 millionth mask wearing American tested positive COVID-19 virus. Back Bob. lot people comment threads bit ignorant authorities work Sweden. Somehow everything put FHM known taken account even ""not let happen"". dare say, swedish people know difference much better, trust FHM quite high compared SöS big drop extent problems system highlighted May June. 

I think lot people unaware bad management regards. measures outlined - management even try separate sick healthy residents - one example. FHM write explicit recommendations done one first thing health care professionals would dealing infectious disease spread. reports started coming nursing homes fact using ""lack recommendation"" excuse issued official document.

It also puts former flu pandemics dark light. management ignorant mass information campaign literal pandemic, would explain many annual flu deaths homes - staff less opportunity stay home sick less protective measures keep residents staff safe? Oh wow, really idea much transatlantic travel happened summer still happening. Either naive live anywhere near bit city. drug dealers. They're alleged spies. Celebrities, lmao. Quick question, none studies say immunity lasts ""x"" verified I've seen different reports contradicting can't sue federal government intentional wrongs, unless allow to. Finally visiting family ( father well ) .
Part family traveling see family. get together last night . fucking nervous. I'm masked soon get . one else . They're dinner around table . I'm room . B-I-L comes room , enough room table. Thankfully sat far could. Listening conversation typical Fox news views. knew would . mean I'm falling apart anxiety right . love people taking toll. Taking precautions much , I'm emotionally wrecked. wish would take seriously. It’s same. Real leaders listen first make decision. orange monster whatever wants needs. public backlash can’t ignore... changes mind. it’s convenient him, cares all. 

The orange monster cares himself. Someone might need check math...as need count fingers. death rate .33 percent, like cdc claims....and silent cases x10...

NY state = 33,188 deaths. 33,188 x 3 x 100 = 9,956,400 people covid ny 19.5mil population. ifr .33 like claim half population NY would infected already counting excess deaths.

NJ would 16,200 x 3 x 100 = 4,860,000 8.8m.

Am figuring ratio incorrectly? remotely plausible every person ny nj already covid? dose square usa numbers?

USA = 206598 x 3 x 100 = 61,979,400....which look like 10% 331m me. unless I'm totally math (wich certainly could be...counting fingers) ifr silent cases can't correct. Sounds like something crazy-ass leader US would say. even look bit alike. can't teach stupid. How? Literally no. image excellent.

So smart! amazed us all. Captain Harris police academy? Yeah Italians hate freedom. buttoned up, fun. Wtf Boris saying Sad things half country believe crap, tRumpism. Yeah we’re fucking awesome right now. Idiot. Toenail RIP 
That's say. probability intra-family transmission around 10% - 30%. See Table 3 Corona &amp; Irony

Together forever, Harmony. Wow, hadn’t heard high! That’s great news indeed. people US access one? detailed data. Well that’s visual. Gee. Shouldn’t thought making policy Covid. Obviously it’s important understand nature population trying protect. Jesus people fucking frightening. feel like 4 months I’m going playing Far Cry 5 real life nationwide scale. moved NYC Berlin last week. Loving freedom. Yes know, I'm saying FHM, outlining strategy, put much faith system inherently flawed. know Rand Paul moron. knows he's wrong. also knows bullshit way scenario people die, stockmarket goes up. Good lord, G variant that's talked since March. Nothing new here, move along. friend mine, recovered Covid, seizure. He’s healthy 30 year old dude, pre existing conditions. hope get info ASAP long term affects. nothing man women, except fact case mom. Get victim bullshit hear, try get real identity. bar getting lower You’re absolutely wrong. science support would love see it. restrictions came way death. restrictions caused lot death personal opinion, don’t size fourth logic. scientifically accurately true communities put harsh restrictions work restrictions failed miserably majority population going die already died that’s things got better that’s science have. evidence dispute I’d love see otherwise it’s you’re ill informed opinion. that’s helping anyone you’re actually contributing massive death giving opinion based science. opinion based science may totally helpful least give us knowledge move forward problem instead crippling peoples lives economically ripping Band-Aid said slowly stead getting issue facing unfortunately. unlike Sunday afternoon drive? know, pleasure? He'd ""fake news"" faster spray tan drips blubber. Fancy pants college boy Florida actually higher per capital death rate Italy, lead building.

No place ever see outbreak like NYC - densely populated city, winter, 6 weeks uncontrolled growth masks testing. know good idea - two guys wordlessly screaming beating people baseball bats?

Sounds like somebody might end needing doctor... statistics show 20% infected already strongly limiting spread disease therefore helping protecting vulnerable groups. Fauci Paul wrong right. Taking one herd. need tens millions maybe build shit hospitals.  Rand Paul suck dick. reasoning fine, took issue original post assuming # cases equal # confirmed cases. article says severity difference seems present underlying medical conditions still biggest factor. Unfortunately, big difference privatized public elderly homes term fatalities spread infection. large difference also different companies running private homes. seems management, necessarily money come from. exactly point, there’s lot merit statement Bill Gates’ greed held back progress desktop computing lot. government good senses already. ignorance would cost lives. like attempting translate punch line Russian joke... Look didn’t attack father personally, stop think long list things provided doesn’t we’re response knowledge medical system America works us. painted father different separate way people profession operate. 

I made generalization personal attack, I’m trying rude feel like info good guy dad drove point home. Thanks! Yeah, seem support Cornell's plan, really good know every school opening rampant spread, easy think that's open schools read news. friend's daughter started SUNY Fredonia campus seem okay there, too. surprised find resident doctors elderly homes, nurses. asked parents situation system home country (other EU country) told actually exactly like well. However, norwegian nurse actually pointed interview May think, Norway way nurses per residents every home Sweden. Well wtf think going happen? Don’t send kids school unless you’re okay potentially dying year. morons - they're *blast*. search Korean Starbucks cluster get lots articles it. I'm hoping becomes norm people sick wear one. I'm flashback kid open coughed parents didnt anything it.....put mask least kid. Worse. Windows Millennium. spectacularly stupid purple everywhere. Although early March highly educated people (professors such) could recognize coming... That’s related talking keep distracting Around day 9-11 gets suddenly worse, insist hospital.

Just say COVID mild 10 days, severe 2, kill without basic oxygen supply nose. Make sound simple easy. couple websites ready.

Don't bother unless gets worse. That’s related talking keep distracting Let's face - folks he's dealing lately?

He's probably *LOTS* practice. 

&amp;#x200B;

That said - I've feeling he's short natural talent area. 
Especially provider facts birth Age Disinformation. None places herd immunity. Instead better restrictions better compliance going second wave . Along Flu Season. Imagine combination Flu COVID-19 time! still let survive. good news tag....  new system around scanning NHS QR codes restaurants bars etc., sure optional point.

Also anonymous tracking system provided Apple/Google rather previous centralised data harvesting system certain advisor pushing for. Tegnell FHM charge elderly home care (in sense authority's role powers responsibilities) take consideration would mean aware/knowledgable assume ""gross incompetence"" governmental authority charge elderly home care (Socialstyrelsen). Testing, smart restrictions, research virus actually harmful actually is.

Oh, wait, would take intelligent coordination multiple levels society.

No, we're going keep shouting virus continues spread half us forced continue stay home - thing preventing catastrophe. can't annual every six months, cost lot money development side logistical one vaccine can't pass certain threshold  Vaccinating everyone 6 months? No, least take couple years. If, vaccine eventually comes. People would actually hear way.  deny it. deadlier, end bad flu. learn live it. bad put laughing emojis articles read? live Missouri. college town state. Parson idiot. carehomes FHM sense authorities' roles responsibilities. Socialstyrelsen. comment makes perfect sense. blind dumb person wouldn’t seen problem right front face, plastered media. Except he's alone that. He's referring many analytical studies based real-world data estimated herd immunity threshold well 60%. Morning announcements today broward elementary schools signaled welcome back message...all hail emperor chump cohorts (DeSantis_Phuckker) Yes he's involved silly scandals they're that. I'll take silly scandals games parties play day. Yep, people returning school Shenzhen... Every single person spend two weeks hotel low risk money. think want. used trust follow blindly like sheep....that making dumb. Sure, public elderly homes compete privatized ones, forces cost-cutting measures, hiring people zero hour contracts. Thanks people like sympathizing antimaskers ever. Never thought day would come.

Listen, really care much care people wearing masks, wrong wearing them, whatever...but it'd great post _outright lies_ like this. Masks extremely uncomfortable, end. They're supposed put TIGHT filter front nose mouth little air possible supposed escape sides. they're uncomfortable...YOU wearing wrong.

Surgical masks actually worst due bad straps ears, FYI. since exactly wear headbands, pain ass button thing too. Usually fatties though factor ten Sorry loss. hope workplace better, can’t imagine losing coworker. one person pass away plant (2500+ employees), people still don’t think virus serious. south wild. extent yes thats enough cause *suffocation*.

Decreasing CO2 releases still important air pollution still dangerous you. existence quasi-private carehomes means ""public"" carehomes compete them. money flows place though, taxpayers. Also herd immunity threshold varies location. threshold may 50% biggest, densely populated area America, could well 20% 40% entire nation. COVID RNA virus likes mutate quite comfortably.

Everything read virus suggests mutates far less quickly example, influenza. even ""error correction"" capabilities make sure unwanted mutations happen - vaccines expected able target known variants virus - write reams text mean know talking about. good evidence protective immunity cross-reactive B cells. studies suggested people find CoV2-reactive T/B cells unexposed people, that's different implying actual, functional protection infection. needs studied way base public health decisions it. beside that, infection data (and common sense) suggests resistance infection based previous exposure coronaviruses enough stop CoV2 ripping communities. Orange tactics look awfully similar Reddit tactics. comments

I see uncomfortable liked among Swedes

Speak Note friends Italians living Spain. 

I live Spain too. Well would me... pretty much everyone Italy. 

I can't say know anyone point true Italy also true Spain viceversa. People dumber smarter one country mask use high places. 


Clearly Italy something right Spain people give shit covid higher degree places Europe. hard hit places like Madrid maskuse 90-95% since lockdown ended (even made mandatory Spain).  


It's frustrating people countries mask use even mandatory outdoors blame Spaniards ""too friendly"" ""partying much"" instead bullshit like regional goverments closing parks things asking contact tracing volunteers months promised going hire central goverment gave 1.500 million euros pandemic. mean people find enjoyment murder too. Probably pretty valueless er, negative value creating experience though.  Except time virus corrupts cells need beat it, also I'm ignoring fact steroids means put pulmonary ventilator new report find mutations made virus deadlier. viruses accumulate genetic mutations, insignificant

This report studies done early year, getting published. There's plenty apartment house parties picking slack. Well anecdotal evidence, Alabama every restuarant filled new capacity cases still. think point get numbers pretty low plateau open much can. things start going open things. Well, ass backwards? /r/coronavirus logic

Herd immunity calculation based real-world infection data: NO

Herd immunity estimate based entirely different disease: YASS Masks supposed make uncomfortable, wearing wrong then. Get surgical masks. even know wearing them.

N95 masks, sure, uncomfortable unnecessary except medical environment.  school can’t see made discernible difference. pedanticly point steroids kill covid? 

Ignoring fact steroids help deal issues caused covid. net result surviving virus critical cases. 

Most treatment viruses involves mitigating symptoms buy immune system time beat virus. Pretty sure unique Chicago. Dude they've done past. arrest people say spies get one actual spies returned exchange.

What sad expect us believe anything effing say. What’s tecaher theoretical, top epidemiologists infectious disease specialists stand 70% number. think lower numbers best wishful thinking worst actual propaganda campaign lockdown skeptics.

New York 22% population infected. Everyone wearing masks mitigation. ""herd immunity!"" That's is. able control spread person school ""open"" necessarily. still outbreaks. lower numbers theoretical unproven. 

It also take account fact know long immunity lasts. know. immunity lasts 6 months 1 year, herd immunity even going thing everyone gets vaccinated once. really way. haven’t Bass Pro lately see.... deliberate policy allowing virus spread, albeit slower pace.

Yes thats ""supressing far possible considering"" means.

If full lockdown allow spread. Oh yeah that'd crackalackin another article teacher, school trustee called death “hiccup” going push bring younger grades back 5 days week instead 2. don’t words. happy way things currently (social distancing, restrictions)? I'd hope selfish standpoint, would also want return normalcy. Depending vaccines' effectiveness, probably need least 80% population get shot. Based current polls, lot people corner. Herd mentality...he making sound like know shit. It’s literally every open place. nobody knows personal space means. article nothing title. They're saying happening, already happened months ago. read wrote?  Spoiler alert.....he survives it. makes sense. Finland Norway recorded much smaller economic contraction Sweden yet locked down. 

There deliberate policy allowing virus spread, albeit slower pace. Hey, gotta wedding even kills grandpa grandma! Every soul entering country still needs 14 days quarantine hotel places, 14 addition days home.  reduced testing. meant C02 realesed dead bio masses Amazon forest That’s apt. Especially experience: I’m centrist^1 generally like hubby keeps getting left years go mixed feelings. 

Trudeau fantastic handling covid19. Keeps getting boneheaded scandals unfortunately. 

^1 • least that’s hubby says, I’ll take word it. Fuck china controlling virus Sinovac's CoronaVac Stick optometry, Randy.

* Dr. Fauci, probably politicall correct choice. choice allow us resume normalcy. one people says ""I'm scared, I'm already going normal life"", I'd tell things normal travel countries pack stadiums sports games concerts. 1918 flu pandemic infected third world's population killed 50M people, lasting 2 years. Modern science allows us avoid fate. trust health authorities, I'd suggest reading covid19 sub. full scientists doctors dig study released. also mentioned health authorities lied masks gave reason. agree never done this. would reason lie vaccine though? It’s making people feel warm fuzzy. It’s fact CANT K.N.O.W. aren’t infected. 
You can’t meaningful realistic way demonstrate others aren’t infected, promise isn’t good enough. Yes no. I'm researcher working covid19. tittle misleading. mutation enhances chances virus infect nothing hand washing mask wearing. Please read research stop causing panic.

Cheers Lemme guess thell figure out. Screw off. Blame policy government people dont choice. Screw people. Restrictions society luckily won’t based your, anyone else’s, personal preferences, though. except improve survival rates critical patients. imperial college London fake too? Sceptism publication key part science! right. Noone calculated absolutely horrendous amount whinging foreign people social media foreign press.

As far strategy tho. well liked among Swedes actually live it. That's reported cases. So... Let get straight. (I could way off-base thinking). People fought tooth nail current coronavirus created lab. 

But yet, are, coronavirus created lab. things make say hmmmm Nice. Covids woken lot people this, included, people tell happy designated essential (im completely not) still job.

yeah love go work fact 100% exposed point entire management team working home skyping damned pajamas tell ""everything"" keep us safe.... crock shit. difference getting cells respond peptides dish actual protective immunity vivo. Making conclusions 20+% pre-existing immunity observe activation patient samples pure speculation. many ways, even make sense would much pre-existing immunity. Either way, way know significance take prospective study compare infection rates severity. even then, actual public health data shows pre-existing immunity individuals, enough stop virus ripping community. better fucking Not. He’s dumb masks, it’s states rights issue. Well that's happens put education, regardless pandemic concerns, ahead actually valuing people's health safety. Literally nothing article support second title I'm talking things shut down. makes sense seeing threw actually trying conversation. guess expect people Reddit? many can't one without insulting someone. exception steroids enlarge ACE receptors shit virus  everybody except Vietnamese pupils could 15M cases now, perhaps around end 2021 sufficient numbers anti-maskers get infected make major contribution slowing pandemic. sadly, posts like guys get upvoted. Ah conspiracy theorist too. never said covid man made, anything hcq. RECOVERY study UK made great strides steroids reduce mortality severe cases covid hand. 

Same vaccines research seems coming along nicely likely allow us return normality. Much chagrin almost like already practice mouth hygien. Good thing they’re easy kill Kentucky’s two senators, Rand Paul one Mitch McConnell, possibly two biggest assholes senate. (I’m Georgia exactly much brag home state)

Something severely broken relatively small state population economic impact much outsized power country. Swedish strategy supress far possible

Big oof.

Who would thought almost nothing, would consequences? nah? I’ll wear mask cold. Otherwise, vaccine comes out, I’m done. seem understand ""far possible, considering..."" means.

And strategy well liked Sweden. misstake impolularity Swedish strategy among non Swedish people r/Coronavirus discontent Sweden. agree done objectively good things, I'm obviously side pandemic thing.

However, important prerequisite redemption acknowledgement denouncement bad done. far know, never apologized anything far tell feel shred remorse it, yeah fuck him. He's indeed hero. Well people buying available tickets clearly see value it. enjoy digging pool back yard fill right back dirt, pointless? bad seasonal flu epidemic 62,000 people died, still quite high rate death COVID.

Is entirely possible US extremely bad incompetent management sect-like behavior around virus managed politicize? Yes, ""science"" made scientists discharge institute embarrassment caused saying virus man made hcq works proves signal exact opposite subreddit really exo chamber full people repeating manufactured feelings standard reactions. know you’re joking jeeze Netscape  know right? covid like *totally* fake news, like a0.00001% deth rate, people worried about!! Exactly Note friends Italians living think someone wearing mask outdoors protect strangers taking go meet grandma.

Well would me... get droned. north South Dakota , Wyoming, Colorado , Nevada also part USA? 
Aren’t area like Stockholm Gothenburg malmö also densely populated areas? Oh gotta delete comments. Troll Also quite relevant: government went FHM recommendation increase public sports cultural events 500, long certain precautions followed. argument need send ""sign"" population situation still serious

My comment: making decisions without solid grounds put psychologic pressure population ""listen science"". vital many small sports cultural organizations life already hard normal times. good, though, relax restrictions impose two weeks later. really important restrictions constant allowing AI govern nation? Beast knew Trump would win. think back high school elections... behavior voters never changed... big fan stopped liking found past also think people redeamable redeamers path. thank Mark. mean offense ask why? work essential worker customers really throw fits ask wear masks -and wear day every day-, genuinely can't understand why...it's really much bother, can't figure people adamant it. 


I personally prefer wearing mask plan keeping wearing one long remotely socially acceptable. feel like get stared less mask on, air breathing 'smells' bit cleaner. terrible RBF, feel like mask really helps that, lol! voted weed!

It's almost like evidence gathered schools closed!  point I’m wondering many people suffer die understand absolutely necessity.

All them.

Herman Cain approves message. -Ghost Cain. said made sense, “correction” doesn’t make sense. 15k reach New York's numbers... making claim. want convince me, provide sources

The claim wearing face masks prevent transmission coronaviruses wearing face masks. provided ample evidence claim. refuted evidence asking study done entire population Sweden, which, course, laughable. 

If evidence masks help individual level, really reason believe don’t help population scale? agree would like see population scale statistics said done, but, don’t know you’ve noticed situation we’re in, don’t really time set shit up. We’re trying land Mars. doesn’t 100% calculated perfectly. We’ve shown better alternative, good enough precautionary action crisis. 

Maybe could help Sweden get started. reasons could *possibly* imagine masks behave differently mass scale? Whatever is, that’s needs tested. 533 cases? what!?

This actually scary. Understand, regardless happens laundry list meds virus implants heart deny it. like family Karen die Covid said Covid, even death denial end family.

Downside: J&amp;J best honest evil. reach grim milestones—200,000 dead U.S. one million globally—our new challenge overcoming natural tendency go numb.




One group went numb take shoes count numbers deaths. Wait... get hired Trump admin? He's clearly disqualified! “correlate with” “correlate to”, neither makes much sense context. would normally pass without commenting, incredibly poorly written sentence followed writer calling *someone else* troglodyte really triggered secondhand embarrassment. used word ""infected"" cases. two distinct data sets. CDC come said likely somewhere 6 24 times people infected confirmed. ""common"" sense truly ... Selfishness finest. 😔  sub cracks See , u can’t compare apples oranges , QED Care extrapolate even little? actual issue folks?

Or trying explain away calous indifference Americans? understand why, incredibly frustrating ill informed individual, true double threat. imagine lockdown occurred everyone interacts cheered meant deal months. knowledge florida blue offering free actually not, picture nobody wearing masks LOL really? remember proposal went around comments police said no, personnel check control attendees public events. say Missouri, ""Ope!"" So? I've heard mask worshippers dont prevent wearer infection. Aktually, theory fat chance import illegally ingredients make condoms without tax, black market trade fined much thet went story “recycling”. clicks views too, course. survive little symptoms strengthen belief. don’t really understand gotcha headlines. Don’t people lockdowns masks agree virus real would rather get let nature take course instead locking everyone like year? getting quotas that? Yeah shit dumb, paticularly even claimed expect increase aswell.

Its still fustratingly enough recommendations Sweden tho, makes worry mistake again. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's happened Oklahoma. Stitthead mild case completely neglected anything virus ever since. vaccine ready it’s ready, before.  think it’s hitting home &amp; people. boss never took super seriously FIL currently dying Covid. sudden it’s lot serious he’s always wearing masks. Unfortunately lot folks doesn’t matter hits home. Riding huge chuck fossil burning metal, circle back location? time. Apparently post super bad bot deleted it. neighborhood wanting parades Halloween like usual. I'm depressed it. live r state. Stupid stupid does. exists

Yeah, mean immunity exist. also mean everyone *currently* sick - means transmission occur virus repelled immune systems currently virus extent ill person infects, average, less one person.

In addition straightforward reinfection due lack immunity account for:

1. False positives (rare, alleged cases reinfection rare, absence DNA comparisons, false positives disproportionate effect);
2. Cases technical infection immune response needed (i.e., small amount virus present test sample taken, failed thrive) — ""reinfection"" could course much severe body still naive threat;
3. Cases sterilizing response therefore antibodies, infection reoccur — still sufficient immune response significantly reduce virulence second occasion.

Yes, second infection could also serious; number infections declined significantly threshold reached, modelling would predict.  Apparently didn’t know still taking seriously thoughts Covid 19 difficult time. Dr. Fauci talks come across calm reassuring person telling latest news COVID-19 virus pandemic happening gives advice avoid infected. Republican politicians start talk become loud visible angry telling people different theories virus constantly insulting medical professions advices virus causing people get confused resulting people get sick. clarifying stat. asking stats. Semi-relational. think nations governments realise that. **natural** herd immunity. subreddit pretty much always valued vindication basic human decency. replied another poster think answers find *highly* tragic Czech Republic pretended pandemic over, lifted almost *all* restrictions.

Did see one story CNN? residents Prague large dinner bridge celebrate?

I hope still taking threat seriously - wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding dangerous gatherings, staying home test positive symptoms. lived Czech Republic definitely would. federal government this, Mark Wahlberg. Trump bad, bad. Airborne transmission finest. apologized racist crimes victims. celebrity using money pocket rather exploiting public appearance raise money everybody else?

Colour shocked CDC says coronavirus infection rates summer highest young adults. South, increased infections among 20 39-year-olds preceded rises infection people 60. Yup certain percentage doesn’t want get vaccinated wants wait around sees happens “rushed vaccine” that’s them. don’t wait them. said apple oranges compare Sweden US - done. 

How evidence position against?

I'm saying evidence support lockdowns US. many differences consider. can't train enough dogs this. need *a lot* dogs, working dogs lose focus pretty quickly. Bomb sniffing dogs cost apparently around $10,000 train. better put resources getting pregnancy-test-like spit tests world. point exactly. fact unless happen live within reasonable driving distance Canadian Mexican borders, *have* fly countries, prohibitively expensive many people even could get time off, people never end going abroad -- blame them? think bought like 300m doses, 100m end year Point America least, democracy problem. Authoritarianism is.

Without disagreeing EC blatant issue, I'd still say US democracy whole still problem, since regardless POTUS is, rarely align interest average US citizen.

See [this Princeton University. 1, anti-vaxxer strategy would still wait &amp; see. mean want get vaccinated, cool, go ahead get it, freedom, business whether others get vaccinated point finger get mad choose to, freedom, too.

2, combine science politics, get politics. blatantly obvious Dr Fauci much say, didn't, guess why?

3, J&amp;J terrible track record, put asbestos behind Google guess?

4, vaccines year authorized EUA, rushed,and vaccine ever developed kind timeframe, knows anything election year. Also skptism approval process, FCC basically let Boeing authorize 737MAX guess happend? executives go jail?

No.

5, know played Plague Inc. takeaway pathogen leathal contagious time, make lethal beginning ended lose game, virus eradicated itself, itself.

My intuition shit hit fan pathogen get contagious less leathal transmit people people people, mutations makes virus contagious get passed recent studies D614G statistics CFR lines nicely. World's largest comparison group, Sweden, seems fairly well, least worse EU countries.

And call irresponsible person, get wrong, I've always adovocate social distancing, hand hygiene masks. buy CDC's guideline stockpiled 3M N95s whole thing went hand boy pay off.

6 suspect packed stadium, travelling, etc happening soon, whether get vaccinated Japan you? course trying downplay Olympics would entail cancelled even next year saying getting attention kind oversight everyone already knows Japan probably lose everything end fail understand issue original commenter felt need highlight distinction. nothing inherently immoral participating vaccine trials, *somebody* would test minors point ensure effectiveness younger people. Obtaining consent parents legal ethically appropriate way make happen. irresponsible parents neither this, teaching financial responsibility opening bank account, falls category. Picking title reason semantics Nope soon vaccine publicly available mask goes away. I’m also going wait bunch anti-maskers bunch “the vaccine fast” people waiting get vaccinated.  Thats actually better many colleges tests pretend nothing happening. Deployment places ideal use puppers, like explosive sniffing dogs see airports train stations ferry terminals (at least Staten Island ferry). Scan large number people non-invasively. Love it.  PMQs moment dick measuring contests guy Johnson pathetic watch. trying roast while.not arriving conclusion. Yes. simply shifts right. always regressive tax someone. Instead avoid altogether create progressive taxes. UBI without polluting regressive taxes. Statistically though men less likely wear masks. agree it’s partly due toxic masculinity (the type machoism makes man proud wear mask). It’s definitely non-toxic masculinity, type masculinity makes man sacrifice take care family neighbors. ""Break glass case pandemic"" sign. That's thought. getting tested free US? Honestly, point apologized I'd fine it.

I take view anything short felony basically past ""cancel by"" date ten years, even felonies go bad point perp owns apologizes. fact closest thing apology he's said ""I've forgiven myself"" makes think he's still *really* racist - casual racists would pretend apologize get heat off. Sniffing everyone covid negative 99.8% accuracy. figure mean anything prevalence forget public events like football games political rallies! realize viruses use replication mechanism human cell?

Let's compare numbers? 😂 mean I’ll still take Sweden’s baby second wave actual waves happening UK, Spain, predicted happen Germany fly work week. roommate, healthy, COVID-concious voluntarily staying family two weeks clear infected.

Is reason *shouldn't* get tested come back sooner two weeks? I'm mostly worried overloading testing centers labs frivolous test I'm going around anyone high risk. wonder segment population simply immune virus without past exposure. get enough studies coming around 75pct, could start make case that. Fine 5-15% total income past year including unredeemed asset acquisitions capital gains. Definitely. read March, it’s crazy many real-life parallels been. he's 208 kilograms now, 458 lbs yahoo! duckduckgo instead google want conduct research, censoring tons stuff corona I'm torn calling current leader President Leatherface (because mind child, responsible massacre Texans, face looks like sewn together random patches human skin) Thulsa Doom (because he's leader death cult basically snake human form). Interesting. make explosive diarrhea 5 days straight? herd immunity level disease (1-1/R0). R0 COVID-19 US estimated 2 3 herd immunity must 50%. sounds like true democracy extra steps. love Fauci admits New York made mistakes....
mistakes cost lives, making NY worst place world Covid19 handling. Interesting article, part evidence give herd immunity 50% fact 70% people aircraft carrier infected. obviously invalid argument even least knowledgeable person. mean, aircraft carrier artificial environment people much contact sharing air. 

I'm quite astounded anyone claiming infectious disease expert would make argument publication like Nature would print without pointing obvious error.  That’s interesting question. CDC suggests it’s “low risk” don’t enough data really know. interview: ""The fact educational infrastructure Germany little modern, think huge disaster. Even worse fact health authorities neglected past.""

Makes wonder kind educational infrastructure would enough, German British French Italian ones obviously inadequate according authorities.

Maybe they're actually good gets, already, hill there. Oh, thought disappeared April Easter Yes, ""remiss"" goverment agencies ad respond give view proposal. think FHM objections too, e.g. places, arenas, etc, would able hold distances, e.g. numbered/labeled seats. peer reviewed, bs proven otherwise. two comments ""study"":

First, big problems it, others' opinions.

Two, HEAR LOT THIS.

&amp;#x200B;

Even study total BS, triggering massive response casedemic crowd proof they've argued along. COVID affects almost nobody, infected 50%+ many major populations, reaching herd immunity, never knew it. Add crazy theories cross-immunity, pre-immunity. Take pick.

So, ""study"" become football next two weeks' biggest debates. we're going learn LOT including lot Japan, maybe getting attention lately.

I many opinions this, know big deal football become, leave you. time implied something, literally English people think Chrystia Freeland readied next Liberal PM seat. redeamers path.

You either need learn read, or, I'm guessing never left city went trails, skiing, snowmobiling, even hiking. EVERYONE wears masks. always worn masks rec either snow dust face don't. Always.  one gave sore arm headache 24 hours also protected virus ruining everything? Many years ago, teenager, assaulted Vietnamese man point thought blinded one eye (the man later confirmed always blind eye, Marky Mark still beat absolute *shit* him). pretty decent rap sheet hate crimes Asian Black people younger.

While done anything overtly racist since rise fame, also never apologized anything did. Many people think he's still shitty person was, better hiding it. Others think want stir pot. large urban part SoCal anti mask addition usual rural idiots every state. I'm fan Trump, I'm sure scientist type person need. need people person responsibly appoints capable advisors relies expertise advisors help make informed, responsible decisions. already is. women entered workforce relatively better health outcomes declined, gap men women closing. You’re one uppity shithole country compared Canada. Man (czech republic) 2000 cases/day 20 000 tests/day

Idk numbers looked Netherlands real seams like countries pretty much fucked people likely connect 4G networks access conspiracy facebook groups current Covid tests “60-70% effective”—in fact they’re extremely sensitive. Arguably *too* sensitive. False positives larger problem PCR-based SARS-coV2 tests false negatives. 

A rapid, cheap paper-strip based saliva test 60-70% sensitive gold standard PCR tests would great. accurately detect people currently contagious virus, what’s important. Dogs cool takes time train aren’t many. Plus lots logistical problems. Investing resources tests taken everyone daily makes lot sense training fleet dogs. 

That said, fleet dogs lot *cuter.* Data nature backwards looking conditional whatever environment data collected. data *right now* show high spread lot cases particular bar school whatever *does imply* completely different story people there, wearing masks correctly, taking precautions etc.

If look data first cases identified US assume that, data shows community spread little there's need take precautions, would 100% wrong multitude reasons.

People use data time make informed choices future *while also thinking else know*.

That's analyze data.

Edit: guess clarification make comment directed original comment tired dealing coworkers kids. would fantastic protocols place schools success would used earnest elsewhere. I’m even sure it’s total karma, issue first joined think 10k time. It’s karma specifically sub, think needed get couple hundred so, wasn’t actually much. mod please feel free transparent correct vote party. 43% voted Tory, first past post shit voting system. Used 1,000lbs. weighs 208  think he’s talking says Pandemic lol Covid reinfection enters chat Point America least, democracy problem. Authoritarianism is.

The kind authoritarianism suggested talk attacking democracy ""popularity contest"" pick ""qualified"" leaders. Also, machine, properly-maintained, equally reliable time adversely affected wearing.

Listen, love dogs. love dogs jobs. think they're *great*.

However, double-blind controlled tests sniffer dogs almost *any* capacity generally shows accuracy drops super rapidly time. cases real accuracy absolutely abysmal compared trainers claim. important note ""close 100% accuracy"" claim coming people training/selling dogs program. I'm saying they're lying. I'm saying need prove prove darn well. Someone succeeds smuggling drugs past border crossing? That's bad. Someone contagious gets plane COVID? think that's worse.

I'm tempted say need dogs+machines. dog flag people confirm machine. sadly, would still leave dogs' false negative results getting through.

We reliable results think dogs way go. They're cute. amazing noses. also flighty importantly *they can't talk.* can't tell us they're unsure. can't say, ""Man, smells ***bit*** like COVID, might also southern pine - subtle similarities understand."" Karen/Kevin w/o mask bite them. depends much faith people system. 0 faith Trump vaccine take one used tested normal countries. well voted keep training data? train take downs people infected refusing wear masks? much karma need earn stop wait 10 minutes comments? kind annoying. Nooooooo Good points! agree. Better chance hell freezing Boris ever front judge; exception would family court gets sued child support. I’m guessing November gonna gets really bad think even went tangent got completely different solid object distance changing argument pointless wasteful? Bad bot Probably closer 100% precision, I'm doubtful dogs 100% recall. C Diff apparently distinctive smell, asked. overheard local high school coach saying worried season could affected. said multiple kids class test positive, told report stay home couple weeks. told say stomach bug. can’t tell kind thing isn’t happening everywhere. I’m also saying won’t resurgence. I’m saying 1918 isn’t predictor reasons resurgence severity resurgence. 

The best thing point get flu shots stay home much possible fall. That’s I’m family doing. Yay!!! 🎉 That’s good thing. get flu shot too? It’s quick jab arm takes 10 minutes get pharmacy. fuck 120k people? true! probably means share mask wearing areas already strong.....and continues weak areas weak.

From Quinnipiac poll released week....nothing changed, polarization continues dominate landscape................Who trust coronavirus information?

Democrats:

Trump 1%

CDC scientists 97%

Republicans:

Trump 51%
 
CDC scientists 36% need apologize saying it. Fauci said could late “the end 2021” could early mid-2021 vaccine distribution goes smoothly. think countries makes sense announce name suspect crime mass media trialed found guilty. least - might initial investigation perpetrator might different person; false allegations ruined lot lives. also affect ongoing investigations - people connected person might read newspapers hide evidence people witnessed crime relevant information (that incriminates shows someone innocent) might reluctant step forward ""the police got guy"".

Oh well So.. eh, infection still ongoing moved away orifices, Antibody tests show case? Depends, free testing available near ran test closed random days want wait 5-8 hours fairly common florida option paying test ant number urgent care clinics. 

I procedure done week hospital making take test cost $150 day before. dont option going one free testing sites, go free site bring results denied treatment Mayo Clinic. looked ""can antibiotics weaken immune system"" answer appears yes, sense killing gut bacteria weakens system.

I personal experience this. much antibiotics including dentist, led c.diff. horrifying disease. painful. probably get one Rx. back-to-back prescriptions led disaster.

I heard one symptoms covid gastrointestinal distress. need helper bacteria gut, whether covid not, sounds like things get really hairy covid. might inclined skip Rx. keep eye tooth socket looks infected, take it. Also, get medical advice people reddit. think insurance covers it, insurance. saddest thing city (mostly) covering test give rapid responses DOE employees kids school district opening full time person learning next week. parents sticking remote, seem like minority. watch kids zoom meetings class sizes seem small. 

I don’t want hold back kids development. last checked there’s still fucking pandemic going on. don’t understand parents. Merkle scientist, involved politics 25 years became Chancellor Germany. want scientists high offices, need elect lower level offices first meaningless. Look viral load inoculum. Masks decrease viral load thus decrease severity COVID. also good remember even vaccine silver bullet makes virus disappear right away. powerful enough that. Vaccines 100% effective, effect begins fade, cannot vaccinate people time. Attaining full coverage given moment possible. coverage patchy. gives virus enough leeway continue spreading.

Vaccine one tool among fighting pandemic. Vaccine helps crank herd immunity level actually *some* herd immunity speak of. tools masks social distancing still remain important.

The good news course vaccine absolutely welcome addition toolkit, use tools properly, believe able crush virus. gets rid medicare / Obamacare we'll need use ~~turtles~~ graveyards diagnose us cancer.

FTFY bubble, healthier average person Yup mario64 B E B E dogs would make lot sense could walk line people alert instead needing use jars swabs Hello. legitimate question. pretty well quarantined past 6 months. live performer, lost entire year contracts, possible future work 2020 first months 2021. seeing lot people going back school, live sporting events happening, parents posting happy finally see kids go back school play sports etc. large dance community involving thousands recently decided continue hold regional championship thanksgiving, involving roungly 10-15,000 country gather weekend inside venue. 

Are done coronavirus? people things? seems people continue act life completely normal, pushing back opportunities work. Cases continually rise people go schools gather stupid shit. 

Why media pushing serious issue? remember back March/April everyone talked about. seems give fuck talk things opening potential vaccine. mean yeah, great people wearing masks (mostly) everywhere - baffles people actually think sending kids back school OK regard, US done strict lockdown yet. would love winter lockdown, hopefully stop spread virus. US, let's watch kids play sports gather groups inside, idk. Maybe I'm wrong. Sounds like common sense me. weak, fighter. 

Not tough guy. certainly good, bad Sweden. First, call ""shitty science"" based official statistics posted FOHM (Sweden) SSI (Denmark). might dislike weighted exptrapolations - suggestion different approach?

Relatively - weighted population - Denmark tests 5 times Sweden would expect positive tests (all relative population size). 

Denmark tests almost 1% total population pr. day actually ramping up! US would equal 3 mio. tests per day (Actual number US tests: 875.000). 

There might exist belief somehow Sweden get positive tests tested like Denmark. belief - made without argument - way closer ""shitty science"" believing straight forward extrapolations based hard statistics official sources. Oh no, dangerously so? :( girlfriend got one last week. Immediately us, someone requested one told ran out. flipped out.. Deaths reported weeks sometimes months ago. still worrying trend deaths so, represent deaths look like right past week. Unfortunately we'll wait weeks see amount people dying right now. either way cut - Florida's response one worst. Close 100% accuracy... sensitivity specificity? bother either way. probably never return normalcy many businesses wiped due failed leadership busy things always have. Technically supposed fill nyc travel form, one checking absolutely zero enforcement Look know we’ve clashed disagreed lot I’m troll, think differently, honestly don’t even know you’re referring helpful. point effort cleaning everything getting exhausting small risk getting Corona packaging. last time saw sniffing dog airport stuck it’s nose ladies butt multiple times. probably menstruating. handler apologize. Yeah music like I’m quite glad see challenge trial one vaccines, information gain invaluable. would think would test participant first things like diabetes vitamin deficiency things know contribute severe COVID. People volunteer sincerest gratitude. lol 100% first steps nazis took Good job I'm US, woman Saudi Arabia. Sorry, wasn’t talking airports. two definitely allowed N95 masks. I’m talking certain company rhymes Delta. Either actually don’t allow hire people stupid enough misinterpret order think N95’s aren’t safe. lol. I'm sure I've living pretty isolated religiously mask wearing around others, so, well... current crazy behaviour Spain. Everybody wears masks outside soon go bar place take off. complete nonsense. make easier administer could simplify things even little yellow mask sew onto clothing. way every shop owner, doctor, police officer know immediately registry.

I'm pretty sure never tried can't see would go wrong. Yeah think reasonable places like airports. Somewhere relatively trained dogs screen large number people.

However, comment arguing diverting funding develop conventional testing methods towards using dogs large scale. lovely would pet dog instead get brain swabbed, seem practical cost-effective large scale. That, issues ""MaSKs = oPPrESsion!"" bullshit. let's forget elections November. Basically, COVID became political. comment higher.

They give whole data instead saying ""almost 100%""

precision vs recall think tai chi, yoga, meditation, walking could produce low inflammatory good health outcome 

But think correct exercise produces inflammation least immediate response damn Millenials vidya games! I’m convinced yet. lot “7-day averages going up!” stories ignoring 1) cases artificially suppressed Labor Day weekend caught 2) testing up. areas, raw case totals positive percentage down, implying may getting better catching cases.

We definitely might early stages another surge, really need see another week two data sure Here's thought:

The freak anti-science lockdowners got turn earlier year. get say now. know lockdown supporters idiots.

Normal people: every flu season. fine. struggling find official metrics needed WA CA state needed move next phases, specially last fully open everything normal phase 

Specifically, find definitions different phases, exact case rate triggers (x/100000 cases rate type numbers).

For west coast states, know exact case count number needed move fully open phase? saying 50,000,000 die 1918-1919. But, resurgence. Every REAL virologist saying it. states zero protection place. Combine Coronavirus common flu, hard imagine won’t resurgence. Yes, since beginning. see people making assumptions people, calling ""Do0mers"" nonsense, trying talk real issues. cadre malcontents accuse people taking positions never took, exaggerating reactions calling fear porn. narrative simply made up. precaution-deniers ones actually saying ridiculous things, like ""bodies piled streets"", attributing anonymous ""other"" despise. Interesting thanks sharing study. smell colds. random woman smell parkinsons. government never take responsibility. disagree definition R0, whether fluctuates based behavioral changes not, that’s semantics, recognize position severe minority here.

Anyway, absolutely agree used term “herd immunity” would lead confusion, behaviors relaxed, Rt would rise 1.

I’m sure also agree Rt NY around 0.9 - 1.0 since June (Rt.live), fact ~20% population infected extremely important moderating spread. Ah. 

You actually keep date want decide path mankind take anyway. help unless deficient. Instead ""Vitamin X helps fight covid"" read, ""Being deficient Vitamin X leads worse outcomes"" half flu cases asymptomatic. cases also mild could mistaken bad cold. real chance actually infected others, get shot. medal, interested *educated scientific* feedback muddled profit motives. Everyone calm it’s flu. /s Someone get sniffer dogs meet push- button talking dogs. can't fucking anymore see one person store wearing mask nose I'm going Actual Public Freakout... GDP - gross domestic pandemic Ebola vaccine approved FDA administered 100,000 vulnerable people? believe vax also requirement traveling certain corners world... They're gonna reply justifying want, mostly mental calm. really necessary way overkill. That’s stop pandimic disagree per capita part. they're also track overtake CA #3 spot, probably tomorrow day after. CA populous state nation. 0.6% UK population infected since beginning pandemic, would take long time numbers become meaningful. thats like every virus ever, point mutated deadly go salaries dog trainers, work many dogs (possibly one time; disaster rescue dogs basically live trainers months time, example). Dog training labor intensive; think semi-automated useful extent.

The testing regime people talk basically spit-into-this tests colored strips, cost around $1. basic tech exists, held back regulatory issues. fuck mean. J&amp;J started phase 3 trial. Pfizer already 30k people vaccinated, ready FDA acceptance October/November. black, pitch black. shade regarded world's greatest democracy.

Well quite joke. think anyone right mind would consider US ""greatest democracy"", least side Atlantic.

But let's agree disagree move on. Looks like [we've testing roughly amount since agree hospitalizations accurate metric, there's problems it. First, hospitalizations spike several weeks new cases spike, time see data there's weeks massive spread. Second, new infections concentrated younger population spread even longer moving older populations far likely hospitalized. NY testing levels way beyond state right positivity rate daily case count way lower.

See stupid “stop testing you’d stop seeing cases increase” sounds now? objective fact base months data.  literally opposite science. long re-use N95 mask?

I bought couple N95 masks several years ago using reusing last six months. Usually wear get groceries, 7-14 days passes wearing one (for 30 minutes) wearing again. know generally recommended masks theory they're still better protect others cheap masks could buy pharmacy internet. fit well, one thing, really good nose clip. isn’t 2020 apocalypse bingo card Ok, congrats? want medal something? Health care professionals made clear it’s especially important get flu shot year don’t get don’t care there’s really nothing else say. RDJSighOfRelief.jpg lots factors 1918 aren’t present today wouldn’t use predictor happen. 

It indication *could* happen, many factors, biological behavioral, led second wave 1918. non-vaccination herd immunity never really thing recorded medical history. makes say that? Quite honestly, politicians need understand much anything. Capable leaders keep capable advisors. know people think need politicians understand economics, science, foreign policy... largely true. need leaders. aunt awhile coronavirus.

She cardiomyopathy thanks incredibly medically fragile. Maybe try oleandrin. Oh wait... that's cardiac toxin. Pillow guy says cures everything. No, bad faith arguments based fallacy misinformation be. Yep, people keep admonishing logic...does apply pig, do. far. Look ongoing spikes Nordic countries compared Sweden. virus going around long time. It’s way premature declare best. trust word CDC... removed factual statement web site saying Covid-19 airborne disease?

Pardon French, fucking serious? Thank you! downside see determining path way people truly shitty earlier school, awesome Uni. Would suck ass decide someone's fate based early schooling they're actually capable much more. can't imagine majority, though.

But agree way going US right absolute shit. find disturbing people happy Sweden getting rising cases.

[Looks like expert first batch places hit this. NY densely packed state country. saint, miles better dear leader since outbreak. I’m parties lol that’s we’re talking about. basically ban college students! good luck that. can't stop teens college kids socializing, much stop sex partying. way send home live lock &amp; key parents. That's many universities decided kept campuses closed semester. Yeah *definitely* realistic ""I hoping situation manifest"" wishful idealism. Like, ideal situation wish could treat like 2009 H1N1 pandemic go lives know comparable. dreaming. 

I'm tired seeing us repeating things nation I've following protocols strictly day 1. leads severe empathy burnout where, point, even care elderly/at risk anymore terrible sounds, want job back want leave house essential trips. I'm tired held hostage. 

I'm sure I'm preaching choir feels nice put words nonetheless. Oh noes, *subreddit ban*. However able easily quickly sidestep that? go work? see friends?

It’s hard. Also zoom friends, FaceTime, call lol like spare say parents intentionally sending kids school sick afternoon fevers real something I'm currently experiencing.

I normal temperature 1 2pm gets fever territory peaks 8pm going back night. happens without taking medication.

My doctor said common happen kids. know even thing experience. gave white people strict rule pass Asian descent. rather trust actual test dog. talking motorcycle rally another state? doubt FDA approve Chinese vaccine. Zombie apocalypse caused faulty vaccine next bingo card This. Yep, open except big concerts, stadiums place really big crowd expected there’s vaccine, acquired immunity reasonably long-lasting people, herd immunity inevitably acquired. even if/when vaccine, natural immunity play role virus going away vaccine unlikely 100% (or even close 100%) effective. 

It appear probably get vaccine, smart Sweden count it. approach they’ve taken sustained years years necessary. Probably prove/link propaganda sources. able go library? Avoid tolls. Avoid COVID. Fastest route. pretty wild many things opening ""first week November"" including schools Disneyland So-Cal. probably coincidence still. wait what's company? Can't life think lol Again, misperceiving point. want answer question re: 2014 refugee camps whatever reason, whatever. wish detain anyone period.

However, ppl Mexican citizens either can't shuttled back across border; Central South America, means travel back; even did, want stay US make life - entails hearing judge merits asylum application. processing sped up, obviously . . . Point. don’t wish ill man, getting even moderately sick, variety symptoms, might change mind. Even sociopaths capable change circumstances affect directly. “You wearing mask? don’t mask? not?” hear say this.

Edit: “I’m one donating masks there, you, you, you.” going panel discussion next week, October 1, talk COVID impact Enterprise landscape. interesting see say, work field. info here:   Oh man remember recall crazy expensive considering depth was. Worth every penny. He's much better behaved dog Petsmart training. news. Mark Wahlberg racist piece human garbage blinded man reason race. Mark probably sucked Catholic priest get held accountable crime (the priest testified Mark good boi even though later admitted knowing Mark lying court). answer same. they've infected country, still fly back, however, must quarantine. nationalizing travel countries pandemic, better prevent spread way back. last time everyone filled airports mingled everyone else. horrible mistake. 

It's easy enough get data traveled countries must quarantine.  Actually, affects ""virtually nobody."" /s confidence vaccine right now. anything, think third party review help vaccine found effective safe. think names mixed up...Its younger dude curly hair covid shit. Ron Paul still motherfucker, however.

I look back inexperienced understandably naive grasp politics 18, 25, 30 etc. normal values change go life. several years dieting, exercise stomach-reduction surgery saw shed hundreds kilos.

This right here. Although certainly isn’t healthy weight yet, he’s going right direction many, many improvements body, even they’re visible right away. 

The moment start eating better exercising, you’re benefiting body health. 

I started pandemic around 280lbs (down around 290 beginning year) I’m 230lbs 5’11. BMI around 39 it’s 32. I’m still obese, I’m much healthier before. blood tests pretty good even much heavier, doubts they’re much, much better. feel lot better that’s sure. think New York apartments central air? live anymore, trust me, people using window units using air outside, recirculating air apartments. That's going much exception.

Mask usage far proven effective means lowering spread, without social distancing. Places would high risk air conditioning phenomenon large offices people still wear masks good percentage people working home. I'd hazard guess spend much larger share time outdoors. Air conditioning, open office spaces recirculated air general way less common. Truly man's best friend....we dont deserve doggos. Doggos deserve love wholesome biggest help. sounds great. “puppy training” course childhood dog, thing retained years sit, would something tasty offer lol. much course cost? I'm tempted say need dogs+machines. dog flag people confirm machine. sadly, would still leave dogs' false negative results getting through.

It says article verify cases dogs identify tests. yeah, false negatives problem, they're problem testing method. also states works pre-symptomatic cases, is, opinion, quite valuable, since pre-symptomatic cases probably ones spreading. elsewhere. Curb biological impulses year two

The fact genuinely, seriously telling college students pure insanity never happen. matter logical pandemic, happen. reality expect college age kids this. 

its saying ""Guys, commit crimes need police"". makes amount sense chance working. 

People get tired all. already are. I'm at, we're basically back normal masks involved. genuinely expect general population (much less college aged people) pause lives 2 years? That's fantasy. never strategy, existence higher level population immunity probably contribute fact they’re seeing much *smaller* increase cases anywhere else Europe (that I’m aware of). 

“Herd immunity” isn’t light switch. It’s like there’s benefit hit threshold (whatever might be), suddenly it’s eradicated. additional 10% population immune, you’d generally expect virus spread (at least) 10% slower. New York 4th lowest percentage deaths occurring nursing homes entire country, context deaths throughout entire population. Youre making sense. There's huge shortage right now. pharmacy around it, get right away. pharmacy get like 1 shipment per week, like 40-50 shots time, they're gone less 2 days definition considerate different ours.

And even street Vietnam make think considerate others? take rocket scientist figure out. make sense loss, talk people say ..the flu kills worldwide per year covid has

I know exactly year happen talking about🤔 would home 2 weeks unless tested postitive. daughter low fever stuffy nose. kept home 2 days. cold(we saw pediatrician claimed wasn’t covid could go back school 24 hours fever lifted) believe likely legal government forbid elderly visitors. Sweden, elderly care legally institution like hospital, actual apartments elderly pay rent like apartment. probably legal grounds landlord government forbidding people guests. now, people likely turned blind eye towards it. 

Sweden extensive welfare state high taxes, otherwise non-authoritarian decentralized. degree might always favor situations like this. took son dr check up. wearing hat time 100 degree fever. told take hat put head front AC car 5 minutes come back. took like 95. Defeated whole purpose first place. Complete theatrics. Well, state motto *IS* “Live Free Die” ;) ...suddenly *crickets* herd-immunity trolls extolling Sweden exemplar country.... Stop expecting fascists listen. 55 years ago, why? asshole change hatred you, people like spout here. hope karmic justice you. take glee everyone's suffering. allowed enjoy inevitably catches you?

I hope slow you. really savour misery rest us dealt year. I’m doc use nose diagnose Strep, ketosis/DKA, bacterial vaginosis, things. Unfortunately, masks really thrown talent :( Maybe not, babies even detect pre-symptomatic cases. That's pretty damn useful. certainly impossible deploy dogs trained around world know works. Thank much...!!! 😎👍🏽 actually think that’s happened. made mistake using camel back crowd, straw exposed lol flu. US slowly falling part. witnessing end post war US hegemony era. true UK testing number new cases can't compared spring much doubt todays numbers even close peak cases continue rise whereas back April peaked around 6000 cases per day. lot spare time due COVID always ashamed know swim. 

Is safe go learn swim indoor swimming pools? really busy moment. eh, reddit. 

They like unlikely get vaccine. may believe anti-science, reality see science corrupted politics profit. I'm saying approve they're think nonsense btw. wanna stop everyone work together people certain age group.

My comment someone Asia seen many thing past months ""oh, can't done here, there's way people accept shit here"" etc. freedom that. clearly laws US people accept.

Like Asia almost everywhere walk street open bottle beer whisky whatever legal many states US can't. legal age alcohol 18yo places yet 21 people accept it. used able smoke flights can't.

I suspect minimum legal drinking age post enact one 21yo minimum people say ""oh, there''s way that's gonna fly here"" yet that's now. Good thing didn’t hold Portsmouth rally What's wait time getting test results? can't wait 7 days dog bark!

In seriousness, though, think time us start considering using dogs medicine. error rate could quite high they'd still helpful additional/early data point. I'm choosing money lol.

Seethe harder. even works pre-symptomatic cases. That's really promising. schools reopended? thats root it, housing mixing students big school. prefect breeding ground takeoff point next outbreak Correct, He’s great politician fooling many thinking good job Let's hope reduce spreading bit. Exactly didn’t round corner? US hasn’t order doses vaccine though. won’t available US awhile. Yeah, except attacked position never declared misconstrued argument fun, aka trolling. harassment state objectively happened now? Good thing Trump got Russian vaccine chorus claims complied health safety measures — temperature checks arrival, hand washing, social distancing member masks rehearsal — venue's windows closed avoid moths mosquitoes. group said switched air conditioning fight heat.

The temperature checks provide minimal benefit.

The hand washing useful generally, anything prevent inhaling virus.

Social distancing becomes irrelevant time ventilation poor time exposure lengthy.

6 feet/ 2 meters enough singing, droplets travel vocal projection gets stronger.

Practicing outdoors person least 4 meters / 12 feet apart would probably OK. ideal choir rehearsal, them's breaks. Yes, viral spread always existed schools, diseases much riskier school parent aged cohorts. accept childrens education crucially important. like comment 'Around never know what.' true. Yikes sexist Ok question. often happen? I’m sure it’s case case thing often happening consistent basis? know true. 

We know median age CONFIRMED cases gone down; know median age ACTUAL cases gone down. 

This least partially testing shortages earlier year. 

For example: wife and, father-in-law thought virus late March. Kaiser wanted get tested. 

At time, policy could get test a) hospitalized, b) 60 years old. 

None us hospitalized, father-in-law 60, could get test could not. 

Notice restricting testing old people hospitalized people would skew media age confirmed cases older. [coughs, gives thumbs up, coughs more] - Herman Cain's ghost really understand able understand quantification yet, every sort media like 4 months now.""

 

"" really understand able understand quantification yet, every sort media like 4 months now.""

And understand understand question asked relation reported school-related cases. Generalized (and widely varied, depending listen to) projections asked for. understand understand question. X amount cases, many resulted significant illness? none, anti-maskers use proof right. MOST, maybe minds change. simply reporting, ""we x positives"" cut - KNOW positives. fact, support herd immunity THRILLED positives. IMPACT question. Mathematically. Statistically.

Just watching 4 months talking heads news saying, ""people died"" cut it, either. Maybe population died deathbed anyways next cold flu would've finished anyways. even go rathole controversy COVID stats (or not, depending talk to) reported.

If we're talking 100 schools hold thousands students show effect (sick days) typical flu season would produce, anti-maskers going say, ""Told ya."" people paid enjoyed flight.

You've said multiple times thread, yet never provided proof. almost like lying, course irresponsible, right? yes no?

And I'm trolling. Im trying understand what's going on. strawman. critique arguments. Like confused slowing something stopping. never admit wrong. 

I hope trying harass me, no.  Option 3) Flatten curve overwhelm healthcare system use restrictions keep spread low. Keep vaccine.

I'm absolutely gonna full claim possible options. There's probably options 4-99 well. Deliberate inaction stem pandemic deliberate action spread it: Trump heads Party Death. Yes, course. whole choir takes hours hours editing. singers pros, able get help part hear confident people section. Breaths consonants line up. Virtual synchronizing good options really replacement actual rehearsals. ~200,000 official covid-related deaths, 33 million infections would put IFR ~0.6%, official #s undercount. 33 million sounds somewhat low me. Nah, news desensitizing us mass slaughter likes. US gvt alone killed like million ppl Iraq 10-20 years nobody batted eye. car sounds like lot bed... motorcycle however... Thanks! 1 million tests average every day reduction testing? numbers see much variation depending day week. see averages instead daily figures. get, seems contagious, yet many infected total consider rate seem infect settings. desperate, know get stuck sea due covid maybe never see family someone end dead, even desperate ones think twice. Deliberately strawmanning people is. Hasn’t proven dogs contract virus? Nah. me. 

Early pandemic Florida, got access map showed county many people tested positive area. checked map see grocery shop (this mask mandates widely available curbside/delivery—dangerous shopping). 

I chose store kind close presumably low positive area. days later local paper published article warning people take maps seriously reporting testing site data, zip codes infection people. “hot spot” area really meant virus testing, people area tested positive. People county could drive sites go back ever lived. 

Anyway, week grocery employees “safer area” store went tested positive.

The map read worse worthless, I’ll never allow map influence sense whether something “safer” again. 

This 2020, 1920. boat load vaccines around corner. fuck around? Controlled flights quarantined travelers. Means week quarantine airport hotel leave arrived. already done country coming hot spot country. Literally using PTO America effect raises. Stop trolling. funny embarrassing yourself. I'm troll slightest, way go proving point. Disagreeing viewpoints trolling. meant 24th September. Also got stats worldometers.info Yep, since March. saw friend nearby park masked distanced back August, I’ve self isolating. I’m glad got family me, alone I’d gone insane. takes one infected person pass on. There’s critical mass needed spread it. One time giant political rally- you’re uninfected, add layers precautions lower risk: distancing, mask, touching surfaces without disinfecting washing hands afterward. Outdoor ventilation full sun safer indoor AC recirculated air. 
It’s gamble every time go interaction keeping precautions keeps safer you’re necessary tasks.  Ooooh, talk internet tough guys! Sorry trigger you. Actually there’s study pigeons able detect cancer almost 99% accuracy flock Except actually troll that's pretty hilarious making statement. No, qualitatively different.  university make rules wants. governmental county-wide ban.

Agreed. feels like lot countries, USA particular, over-emphasized masks detriment precautions. lot people seem think long wear mask go live covid exist. But, thats told me. trust Chinese news? We’ve phase 1 4 months already. strongly suspect we'll turn biology/biotechnology solve problems, guided designed us once. one person less-worse another mean deserve praise. need work common sense think they're actually zero infections currently. fuck moving phase 2.

And isolated boulder, story everywhere. expect kids take seriously idiot parents making big stink wearing mask. like, sure mask might flawed, seems like risk much greater mask work one do. 

I know rant kind went rails. frustrating media pushes narrative echoes ad infinitum.

We could 'locked down' population 65 exclusively -- *and* paid keep well-stocked quarantine -- instead *everybody*, probably would fewer COVID deaths.

Staying home avoids both! Sure.

Obviously, mask use reduces airborne instances airborne viral particles inhaled individuals lead transmission.

Im canadian. society isnt perfect would good place start. presidential candidate would gunning time paid vote.. like canada. almost ensures people weird schedules get vote.. like people work factories overnight. voting syatem needs overhaul sure. another case person mildly symptomatic case feeling intense symptoms second time around. Reinfections may rare, I'm longer buying idea expect people get reinfected necessarily milder illness initial infection.

Out 13 reinfections confirmed sequencing symptom severity information released 2 milder, 3 same, 8 despite fact would expect data biased towards detecting milder cases testing become available. good news I'm aware potential reinfections resulting death far. Put hand front face blow it.

Now pull shirt mouth hand blow again.

Something always better nothing. finding inoculum matters. much virus get exposed influence whether get severe case mild case. I'd rather smell fart fart. 1.2 million tested today Morens cautioned one study yet peer-reviewed “you don’t want over-interpret means”

Viruses sentient, either. every beneficial 'mutation' virus undergoes, also goes mutations make less deadly, less likely transfer, less likely survive given environment It’s hard explain don’t understand US system laws. Licensing drinking laws come state legislature apply equally everyone. 

This order coming public health regulations treats group people differently groups. seems violates US probably Colorado constitution equal protection laws. Well done. Ok fine, question? didn’t mean come way. like, “when plan see them? ‘acceptable’ risk you?”

Edit: implying answer never interact people live people vulnerable Happy cake day! Glad see again! care teachers I'm starting think lot parents really care kids too. Use www.covidtoday.in , uses API gives stats like 7 day averages graphs everything.

And average testing fallen. please name disease europeans brought native americans got, europeans didn't. please name one, every single one still scourge europeans. smallpox huge problem right got vaccine. issues bubonic plague antibiotics (including famous outbreak San Francisco early 1900's.

also, talking about, population genetic resistance, something takes many hundreds years. apply current situation COVID-19? Wow, even worse! Unless kept control group dogs smelled measuring precision, study proves dogs memorize dozen smells. temporary job set abroad (my country one affected really want gtfo lol) job given visa housing, really want go don’t want put others unnecessary risk... haven’t travelled since pandemic don’t know would look like risky would be, seeing things haven’t gotten better i’m wondering decline hide home next year lmao many cases under-reporting sampling scams like recent one,where doctor provided samples reach daily test sample cap. like 1% better nothing

This tested incorrect. figure seems pulled ass. Viruses gasses. Despite size virus incredibly small, exist air themselves. people saying X microns matter. majority time virus traveling micro droplet many times larger virus large enough caught many masks, even cloth ones capture significant amounts. 

And ""exposed"" condition insufficient. Let's throw made numbers illustrate point. get exposed 50 virus particles, exposed. get exposed 100 virus particles, exposed. yet, science, concerned feelings, put it, indicating us 50 particle exposure may mean get mild case 100 particle exposure means going ICU. So, despite ""exposed"" instances, I'm going elect ""exposed"" 50 particles give fighting chance.

Put fucking mask stop tremendous baby. [You're animal even worse shopping cart beasts  bad idea international travel right now?

I've never known anyone die flu life. guy couple blocks buddies parents died covid. young teen know couple towns sick. know cases too. lordy dude. said first comment agree it. That's saying effective. agree something wrong also acknowledging would help slow spread covid.

You choose state ""select jurisdiction"" choose Texas. Peaked 25th July. 


But agree last weeks.  


Also good visualization. Bah get mean see ppint, work old people kids school mixing 150 others daily basis, much concern...
Can't hide away forever course, think schools would place covid runs riot.
It's pickle!  don’t trust US don’t see happening.

I could see EUA perhaps Phizer vaccine happening Europe approval, time serious roll think FDA EU align think first get vaccines healthcare workers elderly. Younger people vaccinated months part population. 

If vaccine works 100% preventing deaths elderly virus' IFR collapse.   Cats get COVID. maybe cat knows. also one case UK think dog got too? Hmmmm. I'd sue thats right..... There's word this..... it..... oh yeah DISCRIMINATION! don’t need vaccine 
We got herd immunity actually, fight pandemic that. pandemic caused little damage deaths. think understand whataboutism is. comment obvious direct conclusion argument youre making. Cloth masks work well compared medical masks respirators. They're better nothing, would even better everyone effective masks. So, medical masks respirators cheap easily available 8 months this? Answer: See above. often people get groceries? Cuomo doesn’t trust trump wouldn’t either. agenda tries bully people. New York done really chops compared states like approach Whats thing ""NZ"" thing? swear ive heard somewhere.

Sounds like remote place easy forget. Yeah bubble work. People make many exceptions boundaries other.

Stay outside visit visit time. Outside. masks.  false. 

At moment 1000 person could enter inside stadium; players stuff included 1000. don’t. never did. Testing many parts country still slow hard get. Chances are, know vaccine candidates work fall winter. effective vaccine, commence mass production distribution. Essential workers at-risk groups going priority, available general public while, possibly 2022.

That said, expect continued disruption average person's daily life then. heard first time 90s I’m military. I’ve always liked kept getting pissed shit can’t control. come across lot life can’t control. Adapt overcome! Lol can't survive ash. love myself, there's two ways mention clear subtext.

And know stealing people's words absolve saying right? people want harp badly Sweden done people want save lives better policy people taking seriously. Also number testing way since beginning weekly meetup online that's lasted year. 

It's called DnD. many hookups. many imagine. many. movie hilarious though. Especially part Mrs. Jones need source “masks become dirty”? curiosity, how's unemployment figures looking? obviously Texas.

Proper lockdowns? Like Spain? France? UK?

How's Sweden way?

""ugh wait 6 months vaccine friends might dead then!"" might able put together coherent plan us underestimate importance decentralization review process. Approval regulatory inherently subject politics, democratization independent global review critical ensure non-medical experts remain confident regulatory body.

The EMA (Europe) PMDA (Japan) widely considered close peers USFDA. red flags either would concerning, hand much independent USFDA independent confirmation valuable even without political intrigue play. 

The point I'm really trying make *CAN* confident FDA's capabilities independence *BECAUSE* comparison - extremely capable - global agencies would make interference obvious. anyone campaigning appointing FDA head say, rejects science Plan B - would look like morons. indicates lockdowns (on average) pretty useless. one friends states every 2 weeks. We'd usually meet various conferences year, obviously happening. nice get drinks chat, end going hours end going bed late - like going old days!

So yeah, impossible. nice meeting IRL, obviously, scratches itch bit.

Thanks much Wow surprisingly excellent read! ?? per link, Excess deaths peaked week ending April 11 41.2% expected; Dipped 10.5% expected week June 20; rose 21.1% expected last week reasonably complete data August 15 (again, link: ""Data incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate ...processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more""). Strep sorta smell like tonsil stones? get strep times year always feel like smell vaguely like tonsil stones. r/AgedLikeMilk never denied masks work hospital setting. said evidence masks work public setting, hence cannot recommended FHM.

Did listen [interview Johan talks bit motivations that. assume understand Swedish. Ying Yang, they're opposites. Yes, there's little way public coordination reporting this. 

It place every treatment facility US, public web portal heatmap data viewed, used help guide reopening plans. We've never compared deaths elderly terrorist attacks this, become thing? concern opposite. Europe approve it, USA does. 

Then what? 

I'd say first line get it! Wait 'a while' see safe effective distributed? Ain't truth...

Also, Branson like roadside tourist trap turned city never disregarded argument, like said before. give full attention busy snippy insulting. resorted petit insults could civil discussion. someone power force private sector ramp production medical masks respirators. that’s less 2.5 million dead Trump keeps saying measure success. wasn’t point all. think we’re close page that’s point second part post was- surely least part reason young people cases attributed fact work high-risk jobs.

However, aren’t acknowledging young people (like incoming college students, example) partying little concern Covid. people working high risk jobs, working general. group young people I’m referring I’m saying would helpful little bit concern Governments pretend colder weather though. Defund police-dogs Europe fucking mean US fucking six straight months. Europe's second wave. US still first. article talked loosening international travel restrictions.

Yes, France Europe seeing huge numbers goes show many undercounted winter/spring compared death rate. Hopefully won’t reach levels I’m seriously concerned winter people getting tired following restrictions. bad sounds, American living Michigan, I’m terrified upcoming elections compared next wave get. Yesh good thought impractical.

During emergency verified science need enforce health guidelines. Someone refusing wear mask given fine. Thats really smart whatever country live imo  would honestly vote real progressive Conservative party. However never vote party homophobe previous leader pond scum like Derek Sloan elected MP. Except Reddit Well, love2fuckbearthroat, problem comes young people interact old people can’t protect themselves: grocery workers, gas station attendants, food service, etc.

We don’t live Logan’s Run. Young interact old. 

I don’t agree restrictions based age, understand trying accomplish. *garbage burning intensifies* seriously hard successful. Reddit holding pen lot people like externalize problems refuse take responsibility them.

Yeah right wing unbearable days &lt;*rolls somebody's gonna get laid non-partisan get vote effort. Family members disease vectors like everyone else. think mistake act risk infection different know person. Unless live (and probably already viruses do) they're risk you, vice versa. Yeah, agree still see disease go flu season. 

But make /u/overhedger said false. countries bad consider early march april, testing basically people already virus, positivity rate high. countries less 2% positivity rate, meaning even hundreds thousands tests, finding cases, meaning infection spread April. 

On top that, also true doctors getting better treating virus. fortunately learning fast adapting today probability surviving virus much higher first weeks basically putting people ventilator hoping recover.

The vaccine arrive 2021 hopefully, much true. reinfection still something that's rarely happening, overwhelmed hospitals happening countries either, luckily.

The death toll US however... that's something feel I'm able discuss, screwed carrot president anything possible.  people believe like believe. Look prevailing beliefs, objectively reason many even remotely possible. People, large, willfully ignorant. Stay positive Oklahoma! guess what?

the anti-maskers never going admit wrong

we already know they're wrong, people died, lot going die it

whatever fuck trying helping I'm saying JT sending money AB Harper *before* COVID hit (the federal government obviously sending truckton more).

Then again, see Kenney fucking enough seem mind. Cancer librul hoax first place far tell [they used *same set samples* 14 patients (half train dogs used test dogs. Training entailed exposing dogs samples thousands times five days.

Good riddance Great Satan he's around politicians 30 years. soul-sucking arguably peaked recently, always there.

But also, like fooling zombies - often enough simply adopt vacant stare shuffling gait make moaning noises.

As much fight still seems him, tend suspect mostly second (camouflage) option. Germany really beacon far. Italy also seemed learnt past mistakes. Thanks this. Here's 200k dead Americans! Recently read interview w/ Harvard professor epidemiologist made point instead trying stop something know people going anyways (college kids partying), don’t find ways make safe possible. compared providing free testing needles heroin addicts. seem forgetting lasting side effects virus. It’s death. guess CDC correct say something doomerish. Undercount could go either way. everyone broad population epidemic undercounting underreporting, excess deaths could mean IFR higher. We're trying stop spread among age groups. Apparently college kids stupid selfish adhere guidelines prevent community spread. Europe it. looking Poland right now. Yeah that’s totally sniffer dogs trained do. /s Psst... could still absolutely isolate international community. We've got resources easily survive least short time period.

And I've made comments past blocking countries 100% cleared. even then, would still 2 week isolation people/things arrive locations ""claim"" made, sure. even 2 week time period lifted, would another 2 weeks people/things let without isolation closely tracked.

Odd, wonder projected infection numbers revised outcome always going #... /s

Gee, novel concept lockdown people can't go interact lessen(orrrrr eliminate?) infections hospitals handle have. wonder would happen true lockdown occur long enough... /s way laws setting minimum ages smoke, drink, drive enter bars. 

The problem one balancing right assembly states legitimate interest protecting health. might redraft law narrower covers places young adults hand like bars, clubs, etc public spaces like park. precedent former latter. people go places (besides professor example) 18-22 year olds banned gathering? 

Because 18-22 year olds carrying virus demographics moment. cause people become vulnerable person could walk 30, 40, 50, etc year old Walmart get virus too, people still allowed gather? 

The reason still allowed gather appears taking precautions, people whose lives bullshit. restricted select group people’s freedom using questionable reasoning.

I disagree decision well, reasoning really questionable. disagree it, taking ""let people protect themselves"" view it, view ""lets help keep people higher risk safe."" ***Thou shall fomicate.*** No, actually. Men get taken seriously virtue men (because women dismissed ""hysterical""), want go. men wanting go also stereotype. real issue hide emotions. vaccines don’t make something deadly. Example: flu. people get infected, it’s gonna get riskier Ah see. That's amazing skill! Good luck well. 


I numbers (nor anybody else think). pandemic half year old long term effects ... long term. enough anecdotal evidence makes plausible 1000s parent deal this. top that, loosing family members hard kids too. 40 million pretty much conservative honestly idea you’re talking  fit.

Good Luck :)

Oh.. please make sure post sub mentioned.  WHO. cannot force countries act. China informed early January. Countries like Korea took seriously, countries like US not.

No, US pandemic response team Trump fired them. need again...or new powers granted CDC. Certain drugs make ""brand"" smell ""off"" ... though mostly effect directly endocrine system sort wild magic yet figured out.

Ketoacidosis works way, smell different altered body's natural smell producing system via hormones ...

Infections necrosis smell ... well bacteria ...

No idea COVID neurological trauma, though guess probably something produce smell. I'm Texas, barely locked all, reopened aggressively cases skyrocketed. Businesses closing good now, lot people (my wife included) lost jobs, economy going shit bad state trying squeeze people property tax sales tax low. state's fucked year, done proper lockdown wasted much time money lives. absolutely get say politicians exact opposite successful countries makes things worse. people say lock ever need stop trying spread rhetoric let us try fix problem.

I took mean 80% herd immunity level virus (I assume R number different different viruses changes quickly get 80%, reduce increase 80%). said depending virus percentage asymptomatic final figure herd immunity would 80% less whatever percentage asymptomatic (so never notice them)

Last heard 30% asymptomatic Coronavirus, 80% less 30% 80% leaves 56% population get Coronavirus (and kind illness ranging mild death) herd immunity achieved.

However state still ahead game - they're currently 29.99 deaths per 100k. half US per capita average Maybe cast horoscope. acknowledged fact testing catching cases, point confirmed cases magnitudes lower actual, think inaccurate use metric examines confirmed cases? literally live. middle school basically half students quarantine even though we've passed threshold going virtual learning students, Health Department refusing anything they're bunch hicks think COVID-19 cold. literally car show town Sunday, Wisconsin highest daily total day before, one wearing mask jampacked parking lot social distancing non-existant. quite literally always done that. difference might kill somebody instead infecting whole school flu.

I think reasonable to: 

1.) Identify numbers start rising 

2.) Communicate real risk R increasing rapidly serious 

3.) Let citizens act putting strict policies place. 

4.) daily basis monitor working, measurements needs considered.

Not like others:

1.) Identify increase, pray better

2.) Still praying pretending go away 

3.) PANICKING forcing back sort lockdown

4.) public like ""what fuck happened"" growth? Lmao. Show single region experienced ass-ponential growth.

In case, evidence choir observe 1.5 meter distance, and, comment points out, that's going effective anyway people belting songs.

Choirs droplet festival, bars people shout music. aerosols primary vehicle, every time office worker got infected, would large outbreaks like this, even among people never room. heard friends. Usually boils ""shit's fucked"" went that. They'd look volatile component dog picking up, virus directly.  

I worked building testing Mass Specs peak pandemic could smell people's breath easy enough - need MALDI-TOF.. lol. say true

Ah we're dealing facts anymore? Haven’t heard, unemployment high right now. Full ahead “Plan Woof.” Air exchange/Filtration airlines good, far away infected person probably OK. problem arises sit near someone infected long flight. I'm flying right now, since want play virus roulette health. No, global warming sort control. hands. laboratory parameters comparable male female patients COVID-19, men significantly higher inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP, PCT, ferritin) across phases disease


I know IL-6 simply ""marker"", pyrogenic cytokine responsible causing fevers inflammatory response. ""4% caused virus"" people call people denial caused authoritarian leader well, would think would top UN's agenda - way, currently huge General Assembly, attended representatives close 200 nation states. Fuckin hell bet fun parties

All said college I'd going out, friends still college wonderful people studying top 10 university UK. Again, young people stupid, selfish immature dont blame them, wouldnt simply means somebody like party college go

Of course relative. studied student area adults, living home parents course would party. Yeah, do...

My point ***why*** downplayed start, decades overhyped overplayed bird flu, swine flu, viral outbreak scares never panned way fearfully portrayed to...

2009 H1N1 Swine Flu ended much deadlier normal seasonal flu's.

2003 SARS extremely deadly, efficient spreading person person, due coordinated global response it, stopped spread past point return.

Luckily, none extremely dangerous bird flu variants we've seen limited outbreaks China years able evolve way easily spread person person.

Covid broke mold deadlier average influenza strains, extremely well adapted spreading like wildfire, managed spread across globe quickly international agencies interdict contain spread. enough viral load system test positive, definitely day 1. best boys best boop noses! Sucks others guess. paid young people could stay home. Exactly, Mr Kim can't behave like adults, get treated like children. happens dog gets COVID? stupid one. Lower testing doesn’t affect %  Say Prof. Raoult, still convinced treatment world needs. do, trustee garbage human. Nothing free anywhere ever. fact thing free lunch It’s always statistically insignificant happens you. feel like least partially due much emphasis placed saying virus doesn’t really affect young people much early on. narrative would shifted towards high chance lasting effects/illnesses due it, feel like least people would hesitant going bars/large parties

So mean lie them? data pointing **High** chance **lasting** effects. Especially among young cohorts. live NYC would love to, mild asthma looks like per application requirements would rejected. :( I'm also pretty sure covid back March, think vaccine might useless test efficacy someone like me.  Nope. Nope. Nope. ""unnecessary social gatherings?"" ""Permanent online school"" I'm gonna live dystopia proposing. trolling this.


Edit: yeah think are. say presymptomatic people high counts likely fend virus. fuck talking about? Uhhh Okay I’m saying fact matter won’t really anything change people’s minds 11/4. again, nobody’s decision hinges EUA pfizer something. approval doesn’t matter initially 99.9% voters. around January see mass distribution among populace. I’m sure pres thinks it’d nice one approved use 11/4, doesn’t really change anything people time. people arms here?  Cause universally count country inaccurate. ANYTHING taken Covid news story need effectively double get closer accurate.

If Texas says 15K, 30K count accurate. 1. Nope , 20% statistically speaking already relevant significantly slow infections 

2. total infections means least 10 - 20 times higher known infections 

and also graphs speak clear language u see here: got flu shot Monday. They're available get flu shot! venue’s windows closed avoid moths mosquitoes. group said switched air conditioning fight heat.

What could possibly go wrong pandemic stuff like projecting spittle couple yards huh? see right winter going covid 19 playground. Wee!!! company guideline paper visitors needing wear masks sign in. week guy couple days doesn’t even wear mask day. comes on, later, walks minutes one nose, walks off. He’s town too! guidelines joke enforced. hate oblivious everyone is. VP doesn’t even wear one. guess you’re rich you’re immune. still get pet dog, right? Or, crazy thought. already exposed everyday working jobs school. working minimum wage, risking getting COVID anyway, try fun too? 

Also generally, big deal statistically. going claim 21year old risk dying 80year old straight face? administration hell bent destroying democratic norms science.  *shocked*, tell you. SHOCKED. wrong. Deaths date dont make better, still died. makes worse still getting data MOTHER FUCKING MARCH. tell you? likely thousands deaths months ago reported yet. Yes, Israel. That's exactly happened here. first lockdown worked well people underestimated virus accused government overreacting reacted either complacency outright rage-against-the-machine mentalities. 

So far ~2.5% population contracted virus. really wish could let things run course end precautions think number anywhere high enough start trying gain mass immunity. think country handle Sweden doing, personal accountability social responsibility, mention cultural differences make Arabs Jews different Swedes. hope little country survive economic hits lockdowns. 

Stay safe wherever are. Ok *The lockdowns, pandemic. needs bot auto corrects typo. question question pretty much farming cases sake it. Let guess, couple positives show would ask closing school. know obsession mindless consumerism ends. wouldn’t. people respect president cuff remarks childish name calling people way apply standards others. 

They would absolutely use Fauci, make remarks “well, he’s smart, calling respected members Congress names?! need stop listening ideas, call people names...” technically passed California like month ago it’s flip flopping since they’ve hit second wave. next: chairdogs sad sad day trust Chinese company much trust CDC FDA. anyone resource detailing coronavirus travel restrictions? I've seen map countries ban Americans know countries we've returned favor personal reasons need know one particular country. Lmao, believe travel ban worked? 50-50 end paying couple hundred not. average person gets vaccine done pandemic. Social distancing over. Mask wearing 90% over. Y’all might want hear moment populace vaccinated moving on. VP considered part cabinet considered advisor? honest. likely she'll de facto president like Cheney even become actual president point Biden gets sick steps would say would crucial look first.

All said I'm curious think end administration worth faith in? would nice something look forward besides four years Trump.  this... good? Like, CDC's official site says IFR 50, OVERALL, 0.02%. young, *typically*, get ill require hospitalization. 

So get exposed, overload healthcare system, expedite ability slow spread? models spreading show HIT based heterogenous mixing anyway. Young people ones mixing. Hah! Thanks. needs laugh today. 

On serious topic. Almost outbreaks seem go like this;

City doesn’t take seriously refuse wear masks.

Interestingly, pandemic also killed ~1 million people worldwide, though hard see relative lethality virus widespread immunity vs covid-19 since lot factors changed (Cheap widespread international travel commerce making things worse, modern medicine lockdowns making things better) prick asymptotic. going bolster anti-mask rhetoric. Sometimes world really unfair then, late act prevent death rate climbing. guidlines put cutoff value positive test low 30’s. definition lot Canadian tests counted negative. going point labor day thing too. I'm MN us 50-100% increase, really misleading several days low testing/new cases around labor day. trending nowhere close 50%.

Aside personally, really matter. 70 million people get vaccine, 70 million already got virus (which might now, say nothing 2021), it'll hard virus spread life completely back normal.

Treatment hospitals improved too. least know doesn’t work works really ailing patients try cure death spirals. Hence death rates ICUs way down.

Just reasons, others, Sweden “delayed” infection (assuming countries delayed like say), Sweden still unnecessarily sacrificed lives thousands citizens.

And assuming countries delayed. would argue countries like Denmark Norway sequestered second wave going smaller due population used behaving increased resources available defeating clusters, main way disease spreads. Via clusters.

Sweden still can’t even contact trace stop clusters happening regularly among neighbors. Every time cluster stopped, it’s saving dozens lives.

Even best/worst case scenario, Swedish approach needlessly sacrificed thousands lives comparison neighbors. **The virus spread via aerosols, people enclosed spaces poor ventilation, talking.**

Japan said back February.

*February.*

And millions people west still can't wrap mind around fact, fucking late September. 

*We can't clean way back normal life.*

The problem people, interacting people. problem things make us feel normal human prevent us diving spiraling depression.

The virus evolved hack natural behavior around social interaction.

Masks isolation solution, vaccine. Exactly, decentralization research extremely, extremely important point. *cannot* allow erode overall confidence vaccine research. diseases vaccines hold bay collectively caused casualties dwarf even aggressive projections COVID death toll.

Let's assume worst say US government intends put thumb scale - would look like, would know? US government absolutely influence internal review process, bypass certain regulatory requirements, absolutely control international (or even American) medical community. many, many healthcare agencies worldwide. FDA heavily bases approvals third party advisory committees, independent non-governmental. Obviously, could bypass requirement, would know did.

If anyone wondering Japan's PDMA Europe's EMA probably FDA's closest global peers.

Also anybody wondering, Europeans leading vaccine companies. AZ GSK UK, Sanofi France. US also Pfizer Merck, European vaccine research network probably least equal, we're getting much data Europeans we're giving  Ah see. mistake, information sent us school email thought specific CU students like ban nonessential off-campus activities issued week ago. transmission rate needs well one reopen room slight increases. two weeks ago. sure happened Labor Day weekend. Swedish strategy nothing leaning typical coronavirus summer hiatus trying project bunch geniuses cases went down. Swedes bought it.

They missed opportunity today add restrictions, instead preaching people listening. February researchers examined search results 15 states high, medium, low Covid-19 ***burdens 13-week period January April.*** Jesus Christ seriously? dumbass county thought would good idea reopen amusement parks? Everything remember six flags like disgusting hygiene wise He’s talking improvements vaccine coverage past 25 years. things like foundation, people Africa increased access vaccines. 


After Covid, everything mess/shuffle. aren’t able deliver vaccines efficiently shifts priority. countries, result, set back access levels existed 25 years ago. Side effects increased deaths diseases lack access right, people need hear need simple.

#You still need wear mask visit grandma, OK?

Subtext, getting bit paranoid think subtext words friend. may scale fast, scale realistically. many people think trained dog could sniff day? 250 4 hour shift? 

If trained 10k dogs (there 500k service dogs US right now, thats small 2% increase) detect covid, could tesy ENTIRE US population 4 months. 

Obviously training would expensive dog capacity would gradually ramp up, level testing way better anything able achieve yet.

Plus, marginal cost test really low. cost per test goes person sniffed. Unlike normal test fixed cost per. make app mandatory WHO. cannot force countries act. China informed early January. Countries like Korea took seriously, countries like US not.

That's... quite remember it. time admitted human-to-human transmission happening (I. 21.) cat bag, already infected people world. time announced pandemic (III. 11.) ten thousand infected Italy alone.

Of course, US fucked badly even funny, earlier incompetence cover-up attempts PRC pale comparison. still, give credit credit due. PRC failed us seriously mishandled situation. comparison even bigger morons look good. cocktails two couples porch, households separated 2m. Ideal? no, going away make do. Even technically legal, you’ll never convince ok Good!

Nearly overnight. One high blood pressure 60+, one pregnant. sometimes hard reconcile reported news I'm seeing real life.

Edit: say discount what's happening. opinion people similar experiences longer taking seriously. Come fuck China ! Get together! I’m way people China wet markets unorthodox food eat treating animals gonna keep creating pandemics. Something needs change. another pandemic comes China world gonna explode anger rightfully so. think we’ll see final excess death numbers look like countries able understand full difference. keep low.

People simply discussing current situation saying might get much increase spread countries have. lot first world countries count accurately, either Nordic does. change fact Sweden reality 10th deaths world. simply misleading say that.

The Nordic countries seen greater increase spread lately. could end dying point time, see. can't people discuss current situation without coming whining past getting mad people optimistic future? Fucking hell. Everyone knows Sweden lot deaths total, need constantly bring bring mood down. still can't detect OP's mom. especially reddit?

But definitely Facebook. Thank this! China also lot people locked homes. Epic created synthetic organism iirc Uhh spotted cow Rand Paul? GOP Senator decided walk RNC Convention White House group protestors, started whining calling police protesters?

What genius! pay healthcare $5000 deductible 8000 pocket max. That’s even including employer puts Coronavirus RNA polymerase proofreading, influenza not. second wave could certainly much worse, doesn’t need mutate that. community spread many areas equipped handle mass hospitalizations, winter weather, impending flu season, lockdown fatigue could make December-February devastating. Rand Paul twisting truth order push political agenda. Plain simple. Fauci health officials made mistakes, professional enough humble enough admit wrong based data up-to-date scientific evidence. Rand Paul others government cherry pick data purposely misrepresent order confuse portion public isn’t scientifically literate. health officials trying save lives. People like Rand Paul trying gain and/or maintain power expense people’s lives. Synthetic biologists? Like, android biologists? don’t believe certain realities don’t want believe - there’s word it’s called “denial” One minute, claiming unique avoidance lockdowns.

We never shit. American media sides keeps lying actual situation Sweden pandemic decided happen election year US. many restrictions needed control spread, control it. also fuck comes Stockholm's elderly homes straight admit currently investigation. might imposed full blown lockdowns that's social safety nets workers rights made really need to. 

As soon pandemic started increased limit paid sick leave without doctor's notice 1 week 3 weeks starting first day instead second, everyone even slightest symptoms told stay home sick leave. Obviously government stepped pay difference sick leave normally would employer. also extends sick children, child sick parents get paid leave stay home them. Everyone work remotely immediately switched that, still working remotely today.

The Swedish strategy clear beginning announced. reasoning direct: Community spread already started contact tracing longer viable. That's need implement measures sustain long period time rather extreme measures cause severe side effects like anxiety, distrust hostility towards government agencies, young children missing education. day still restrictions implemented back March. still allowed serve drinks bar counter. still need maintain certain distance tables restaurants. Gathering 50 people still prohibited. Consistency key strategy, besides fuck Stockholm's elderly homes, clearly worked. Sweden's cases per day lower Denmark, stricter restrictions earlier laxer later people started get tired it.

I say let happen, however New York cannot used example region got corona control. much spread matter do, cases low afterwards seen everywhere else hit similarly hard.

An example failure California, tried controlling spread many months yet completely failed reach similar results New York even less hard hit parts Europe. look New York guidance control since New York already lost, meaningless, instead look Finland, Denmark Norway see do, see done things significantly different New York.

Good news - confirms! That's called town hall meeting recently. Herd mentality projecting followers. opposed halloween masks can't breathe ... However know impossible get tests/capita figure 100-200k/million india like present countries. 

Why? China large population India, tested something like 111k per million. Parents always this. work bosses assholes can’t give time even pandemic . Paul’s medical certification, lack it, immaterial. consciously rejecting scientific evidence benefit political career. That’s real story here. knows evil perpetrates. live symptoms would ample reason tested. Good luck. Right. also don’t know Covid *doesn’t* long term effects.

In science, aim disprove null data, accept alternative based theory. I’m saying don’t cautious, I’m saying narrative seems pushed often something lacking data.

Believe science. Believe statistics - right? worst part armenia, Children getting send school masks IM going school Everyday work see customers take masks try sunglasses jewelry etc. ridiculous.

There gonna spike government desperately attempt hide it. Absolutely false equivalency, scope creep needs called out. Every doctor go 4 years medical school, last two rotating every medical subspecialty. every doctor (except pathologists) intern year first year residency, means taking care inpatients wards ICU. mention take 4 general medicine licensing exams cover subspecialties medicine. There's huge difference education doctors midlevels.

That said, many years away early general clinical years training 20s, subspecialists like Paul Atlas vague memories clinical years. experts fields, go source public health concerning infectious diseases.

And I’m interested people’s feedback this. fact New York City barely cases even though they’re living like rest us everybody breaking rules screwing around without masks, kind imply might’ve reached microcosm herd immunity. 

22% seems extremely low, percent may hell lot lower minimum 60% I’ve hearing thrown around. 

That’s good news it’s true. see places go crazy new infections randomly stop. 

It’s like everybody suddenly got smart. stops. chart tanks. Why? virus isn’t spreading efficiently. that’s herd immunity is. bad anyone. Prayers go Governor wife. Get well God bless  ""rare disease""

Although America sure heading wrong direction right now. Ehh, people said thing Obon case numbers started declining right still trending down. Foxnews watchers like Fauci's Lucifer. That’s works. I'll take left one also.

Aiming low. mean, start trying stop things get control. I'm sure US cases one point too. earlier people try start controlling less likely get really bad.

To justify parties missteps?

One half-truth type articles like portray young, healthy people dying. like pretend old people sick old people dying preventable huge moral failing can't somehow keep sick 88 year old alive. people calling out. nuance comments people like say ""oh denier.""

Also, might disagree this, 2.2M people die year US, many deaths would've happened overlap 200K, people wondering point considered ""acceptable"" media open anything given death part life, matter many nasty responses downvotes give shit got me! might even low *gasp* 60 percent! 

And yes, certainly degree fear mongongering pontificating going amongst talking heads see news blue checks Twitter. know pandemic ends (whenever may be) they'll fade obscurity again. result, come make outrageous claims attempt remain relevant long possible. everyone guilty this, many are.  anything ~~man~~ small child can't do?!?!?  conservatives. literally get notion remaining antiquated outdated.

Research 50,027 volunteers China shows Coronavac vaccine show significant adverse reactions

Among people 60 (422 volunteers), results showed 97% effectiveness

In Brazil, vaccine applied almost 5,600 volunteers record serious adverse reaction

Governor João Doria announced Wednesday (23) results survey 50,027 volunteers China demonstrating Coronavac vaccine, developed Butantan Institute partnership Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Life Science, safe significant adverse reactions . Of total volunteers, 94.7% adverse reaction. Another 5.36% experienced low-grade adverse effects, pain application site, moderate fever loss appetite.

""These results prove Coronavac excellent safety profile also prove manifestation made World Health Organization two weeks ago indicating Coronavac one eight promising vaccines development final stage worldwide,"" said Doria.

Testing children elderly began China. Among people 60, vaccine applied 422 volunteers results showed 97% effectiveness. Child studies 552 volunteers aged 3 17 years.

Doesnt seem matter Earth, people getting dumbed hard. trend looking like? Yep! live wear mask remember neuro professor would tell research she'd say. ""Don't try make 4 5 steps pathway"". ""Only figure next step"". Kinda along lines talking about. Yeah. developed autoimmune disease ended taking 1 sick day month, boss called warn mgmt noticed wasn’t “being careful” enough. wonder they’re still COVID. saying think currently backlog cases weeks old counted, happened before? signing get chemicals shoved bloodstream every 4 months next 80 years life? I'm not.

I think therapeutics treaments way go one. Rather building world addicts birth death. level derangement people reached amazing. Sounds like kid understand anything real world. 10-20 years, youll look back comment cringe, trust me. fewer children died flu 2019-2020 flu season also far less number children killed car accidents year spreading legs popping mini give purpose real world huh? thanks e seem numerous cars Oklahoma Maine New Hampshire past couple weeks...

We almost never seen OK plates before, I’m pretty observant license plates, always been... we're able start vaccinations adults early 2021that's still going reduction spread infection less vectors infecting kids. Overall infection going plus kids severely affected whole, means worst news. Back 95, I’d really bad case bronchitis missed week work (I ER twice week). Four months later, dad brain tumor removed. boss fought taking ONE day could hospital brought ill earlier year. 

She gem.  China done amazing job regarding virus.  massive security survaleince apparatus came handy suppressing pro-democracy activists worked suppressing infectious disease too. wife's relatives China told everything basically back normal. would traded 12 weeks hard lockdown 180,000 less deaths early return normalcy US citizen heartbeat. use better headlines? optometrist stepping field tried correct field experts it. soon science stops hypothesis, theory, practice.  Good bot. I'm probably done kids. Delivery cost 7k (I know that's relatively common broke 7k might well 50k time). Add able afford daycare I'm probably one done. 

And right, draw conclusions except right ones looking cause. funny generation told us 'can't feed em breed em ' crying population replacement rate. we’ve spent maybe billion best vaccine research. billion improving testing. can’t fathom aren’t allocating resources fight this.  mmmmm places like NYC people saying since May 20th, #s nosedived. Still waiting isn’t “indefinite” amount time. viral pandemics last years historically. Since botched initial management take concerted effort forthright leadership slowly burn country killing 400,000 1,000,000 people didn’t need die it. would literally control three months Trump said “hey everybody, wear masks rest year public around people. also please cooperate contact tracers.” ones need brain dead followers think “the government” (which controls moment) trying “control them.” It’s totally insane. is... mildly politely put. :) 
which good, hope get back civility! Remdesivir really do, proven trials? People (from animal studies) *think* might, used optimally, prevent disease taking hold. way prove humans Remdesivir though. People know infected least week. perhaps pill could tossed people exposed. 

That's shows though trying show it. endpoint even mention press release slightly better time recover.

Again, one could trial idea post-exposure prophylactic. kidding. always put going doctor. go right away get charged, nothing send test. time finish usually better anyway. huge bill. 

Better wait. waited 5 weeks sinus infection broke called doctor. 9/10/2001? True story time. Back 80s, parent kid grade decided send kid school pneumonia. caught teacher. subbed teacher infected me. almost died higher risk dying COVID. whatever, right? Survival fittest! Rawr! look it? ""cherry picking."" showed deaths time least it’s lunch bug, wonder what’s dessert bug? don’t child lol saying cases though children parents can’t always stay home depending young are. parents able time sometimes sick go school couldn’t stay home got sick school stay parents couldn’t get work. family that’s too. things bit different right now. economy going shitter many people unemployed scared may lost job call anything. everyone opportunity work hours accommodate children. work survive. would still hold mostly blame. go large wedding pick COVID-19 spread it. knew worked vulnerable residents still went. chinese already inoculating people since july, starting front line workers gradually working towards populace. people gladly forever. people (we call people ""assholes"") refuse all.

Yeah I'm guessing 99.9% people wearing mask forever You’re wrong. Patrons businesses like restaurants plummeted early March, far advance lockdowns. Unchecked virus spread ruinous employment. parents sending suck kids sch- 
Wait
WHY SCHOOLS STILL OPEN?!?!? needs higher up. Let's think politicians: jobs go away lose political support. Would lie feelings order get laid off? do.... everything pandemic political.

the amount deaths needed herd immunity batshit. Yep, one jobs, paper. 5 vacation days doubled sick days whole year. unpaid time off, paper. know one write damn policy sent made sure clarify putting paper owners. got sick take day off, act like unpaid day, say policy, unpaid time off. 

It’s okay though, 3 years, got one whole new vacation day, bringing 6 total days! totally fair! /s curious, Wisconsin? Sounds like kid's school. wish paid attention history class couls know talkig Looks like need get Reddit day two bra. Stop gotten to. first day sick... parents may realize kid sick unless act mopey off. Which, like adults could allergies such. number cases, deaths recoveries suspect. lot effort put control narrative. Much effort put controlling virus.
Politics control India, science.
People need appreciate low mortality high recovery rate result current governments policies /s.
People also need get back school work economy recover.... economy headed downwards even covid arose. Higher? Stricter? definitely glossed fact neither elementary middle schools shut Sweden, recognized long term impact. stuff gravy- gatherings, restaurants, bars, privileged enough able work home.... Sweden got it. 
As teacher, impact coming later, especially poor kids. Duh obvious thing ever existence ever. Next headline gonna be. ""If humans deprived air die"" lol ya say think latest White House press conference gave much earlier date. used BMW's mercedes fall apart. doctors lease take care properly

lol modern German cars dont need help falling apart own. Especially outside warranty. think we’re verge another shutdown. wife teacher they’re even month semester far 4 teachers half dozen students tested positive. hey, let’s keep sending kids school 👌🏼 realize Wisconsin South Midwest. specifically Florida Midwest. even doctor, dumbest people I've ever known doctors.

Most people know gone med school ensuing residency/other bullshit tell much intelligence endurance. Taiwan model works handled virus competently start: tightly control borders, swarm cases contact-tracing isolate contacts.

In US, 40,000 new rtPCR-confirmed cases day, probably 200-400,000 actual cases, free travel (most) states. can't contact trace that, impossible. can't put genie back model, can't Taiwan does. people running colleges large decision making skills running colleges? like crotchless underwear! said did??? fucking course are. long term effects? Lock kids that's sure. Maybe childless couples experienced pregnancy inducing activity. Lol ""large cumulative block"" seem 2 days worth. aberration like weeks worth data released once. Stupidity protect Covid-19. Well want home might get sick. Let's honest. heroes matter result turns be. patience Saint... Lmao anyone surprised? Ppl want work load responsibility someone else think covid real. 

People trash Wwerent predicting ""baby boom"" 9 months lockdown? Jeez took dark turn. think skipped first sentence. first sentence true, confirmed cases would likely higher well. Fauci continues deny antifa superspreaders Hopeful use US numbers outdated week!

Here demographic comparisons. would probably look better table that's beyond reddit formatting capabilities.

Florida's population density: 397.2 per square mile. 6.2 times higher Sweden. 

USA obesity rate 39.8%. twice high Sweden.

USA diabetes rate: 10.5%. twice high Sweden's.

USA coronary heart disease deaths: 79.2 per 100,000. Rank #139 world.

Demographics hugely different results quicker spread covid (population density) higher likelyhood complications (unhealthy population comorbidities) . graduated 1990 school district nurses. good news people poor countries majority global population Well let know bro wants talk. I'll even pay speaking fee.

I'm sure I'll never hear you. becomes #1 cause death US consider threat?

The problem isnt people ok. rights don’t get infringe others’. easily spread virus someone immunocompromised. Total shutdown? Probably not. wear mask. Slow spread protect vulnerable. want slap too. goes killing 0.5% 1%, I'm sure selection pressure would strong, even though would twice deadly. also cut hair? Schroedinger's Sweden, ~30% risk takers open restaurants bars, rest social distancing (it's spectrum two groups, that's idea). economy took hit can't keep businesses afloat 30% revenue. That's get high death rate dive economy. Basically bought nothing deaths, since economy took hit. crime. Nothing article explains TMC's Hospitalization data looks almost identical state's. might right, appreciate news like live neighboring state want know. takes hour two cross border bring 'rona. Stay safe! measures taking working

NYC isn’t anything differently anyone else. no, parks mask usage maybe 50/50. remember NYC peaked? businesses shut everyone staying homes. You’re seeing less cases today despite interaction less distancing. It’s impossible pretend otherwise. Better get praying, hear helps fair, leadership gets absolutely vilified conspiracy theorists never-maskers rights spray saliva others, don’t like masks, aren’t comfortable, can’t stand 6 feet away others. 

We live interesting times.  1. tell thousands parents children bad outcomes this. Death extremely bad outcome, tons kids lasting health problems over, unfortunately.

2. Sorry break you, experts agree vaccines won’t 100% effective. FDA sets bar 50% fir vaccine licensed. means plenty parents grandparents infect children.

2. shows fucked US system esp parents cannot get paid sick children even crime deliberately send children school transmit friends transmit older parents grandparents may die.
 grossly irresponsible whatever circumstances doubled Florida’s new cases today testing 1/7th much California. experience never actually worked way. think that’s lie tell school admins do. societal thing values work health. It’s part American mentality since early industrial revolution put kids work. transitioned along society decided put kids school. treat like it’s job treat way treat adult workers regard. sugar coat sort incentive help kids bad parents that’s never really used manner. It’s conditioning plain simple. selfish lot things, unfortunately people planet completely selfless. dream, though.  Japanese here,Avigan a.k.a Favipiravir efective patients get serious.

Japanese waiting since march,that 
our goverment approve drug.Because know lots patients reported suddenly got better,after took Avigan.We know Japanese goverment approved remdesivir,before avigan,but Remdesivir already approved FDA.Avigan approved any.

Avigan Favipiravir tested globaly,So lots supply whole wide world.And Japanese goverment approve this,It's good news,bacause much careful this.

The safety concern is, can't used pregnant woman,or couples planning child.
I heard can't make baby 6 months taking avigan.Which Im sure. teachers protest joining back. right thing

You're already asking much. Yeah pretty much one outside sub thinks lockdowns causes increase mortality. Explain excess deaths places lockdowns Covid. Explain mortality drops recessions. How’re now? Per capita? Compared US? Though really think anyone slightly average intelligence (in literal sense, nearly half population) perfectly capable passing medical school. question opportunity motivation. Nobody surprised happening. Dr. Dre. YEEET. RED IMPOSTER. really, ‘he’ still tweets? Yeah, virus kills elderly effect kids. Thank goodness absolutely kid elderly parents cared grandparents. I’ve everyone direct household social distancing, wearing mask following infection control guidance. husband comes home days across seas tour see get stay lucky streak catching it. That's california public pay database public employees. making shit up. 

I know *all* cops make 500k+ certainly lot do. 

It varies greatly region.  assume HEPA filters air circulation vents?  drives insane. ""But deep clean!"" virus seriously scary-ass shit. think second infection would milder first I'm reading stuff virus possibly using people's phagocytes people's immune system trojan horse replicate. Like WTF? want absolutely nothing it. I'm literally wearing 10 layers mask social distancing least 10 feet. Later virus...good god, learn it, scarier seems well tbf gotta protect boys big corn Virus must special taiwanese strain automatically returns negative results within island Omg really? Truly? Herman Cain, died Covid, doesn’t think it’s risk?

Sounds like Republican me. Nah he’s complete dumbass. really hate callous 2020 made me. quite literally can’t force give shit whether lives dies. expetimenting people? helping people need help right now? Oh look, mild asymptomatic cases COVID. surprise. slimier person alive Rand Paul? fuck anyone trust guy?

Used car salesman, MLM marketer, telemarketer. would trust guy. Jesus. good sources sharing that? Absolutely wrong overpopulation. Fuck get work, sick fuck! stand walk work line. need missiles less mollycoddling, right now! thread vaccine proud making comment nothing vaccine? know China anyways. No. Deaths cases dropping since late July. somehow still fucking verified account. Twitter fucking joke wonder Neighbor sucker punch tackled him. wrong? watch video, said wondering deaths Europe increasing yet, also immediately reminded US June -- sun belt states Arizona, Florida, Texas saw steep increases cases, increases deaths, full 4 weeks media -- reddit sub -- saying kinds things, speculating people really getting sick, fatal anymore. delay almost exactly 4 weeks graph daily deaths begin increasing day cases started increasing. large wave deaths went along cases. initial spike March people getting tested much faster lower barriers testing, doctors know keep people alive longer, fewer die, think. people succumb disease take longer so. Europe looks like graph deaths (if plot whole EU) already started uptick. Oh no!🤘 really think America worse China comes human rights there's point talking

Again, ask hundreds thousands innocent Middle Eastern civilians dead War Terror. Ask 38+ million displaced War Terror. Ask Chileans live American-installed Pinochet dictatorship. Ask Iranians live American-installed Shah dictatorship. Ask Latin Americans still affected countries turned Banana Republics 19th century. Ask Latin Americans governments coup'd over. over. preserve American corporate interests.

100k Uighurs concentration camps? Yes, bad. **NOTHING** compared America **currently** done recent history. know. people acting like he's homeopath something. Good thing colleges, least thousands elementary, middle, high schools open safe! Probably Trump wants keep subsidizing them. Dems wanted skip shit Reps said fine then, we'll shut government Dems caved. False. Polar bear cave goal never eliminate disease, limit spread result collapse health care system due becoming overwhelmed. still young disease &amp; likely mutate less deadly form &amp; us foreseeable future. actually pro vaccine skeptical specific vaccine.  Wow shocker ya talking about? We're rounding turn, home stretch... practically already over. /s here's challenge you. read book, please. learn absolutely terrible shit America done continues do. maybe, maybe, enough people we'd collectively hold elected officials accountable atrocities commit... maybe we'd stop committing them. point we'd actually moral high ground stand criticize nations.

you're bitching Chinese committing genocide, America forced sterilizations border, perform forced family separation illegal immigrants, long history eugenics even inspiration Nazis moment China actually inflicts less tragedy world America does, I'm gonna go around bitching articles good shit they're *actually* America continues drift closer closer towards fascism  That’s got? laid March (Thank God!) first level management job. Upper management cared budgets reducing spending. wiggle room budget ever hire extra employee 32-person staff, meaning one person (vacation/sick/injured/bereavement/quit/arrested) short staffed. always understaffed least 4-5 people employees working hard get injured trying much (despite instance slow down!). Upper management kept asking behind, answer always, “we’re always short staffed.” acceptable answer, told several times management skills real problem. COVID took opportunity let loose. Recently heard half former long-term staff quit...during pandemic! guess wasn’t leadership skills. flying f*ck downvoted oblivion... seem like terrible person Like pro-drug war, pro-incarceration Kamala Harris? blatantly slept way top career?

It's painfully obvious gropey child sniffing Joe Biden take back seat straight step she'll president. Like they're barely pretending anymore case.

You're telling faith her? show care fellow Americans. guess that's get angry anti-maskers.

And get mad maskers. Makes us seem like think we're better people. 

I want contemplate might make someone sick worse, die. God hates ugly little off; [it’s 32, 52 like anyone else feel proud? Like David standing Goliath - except Rand Paul cockroach... get idea. Nobody would bat eye, newspaper said 200k Americans killed copycat attack 09/11. 2900 people killed 09/11, still hearing it. would admit something true? want to? days time big million number come loads articles that.... Even article waited days. call are. haha snowbirds arriving soon, lots potential bodies. Even students whose attendance affected missing school day school makes shit fit bout it. Suck mr governor buttercup It’s almost like US problem parents can’t afford healthcare take time care kids find alternate solutions child care... company fired new mom FMLA ran couldn’t return work due complications C section baby. 
Nice. That’s certainly likely. It’s like they’re going hold vaccinating people 700M doses April. savage “you’re alone that” seems like doctor equivalent “you’re fucking idiot” it’s rich old people power loosening restrictions. rich old people usually racist. Exactly! able get google map direction new club NY City map covered red? I'd say small area north... Many people care like countries.

I'd say good / bad luck Thank you. I'ma save next SWEDEN idiot CDC organization run medical experts. Picking choosing scientists trust based superfluous evidence isn’t scientifically logically sound. factor deaths caused lockdown. 

You can't assume every breath covid...that everyone outside sub thinks deaths counted. expensive. physician's salary. sure hell trust MD board-certified.

BTW board-certified physician. worked nurse nursing home almost 10 years (retired 2 years ago).

Seriously, think it. sick, want work, right? know don't.

I suspect would liked gone home get relief. I've seen number times. can't speak day nurses I've seen many second third shift nurses work sick get anyone come relieve them. can't get substitute, can't leave patients care. Also, would lose license leaving.

I admit read article. I've seen many nurses nurses aides work sick choice.

Attitude add-I've read article. Sure enough, nurses aide working night. says documented symptoms tell supervisor. Wow! Insert Jerry Seinfeld “that’s shame” meme liked Paul long time. neighbor punched last year, gotten smarter running mouth. people vote guy?! study shows around 50% athletes myocardial inflammation common cold infection. Fauci wrong sometimes, highly intelligent individuals, Professor Darrell Francis, world-renowned cardiologist, would likely disagree case.  That’s US politicians speaking people way directly bashed “adversary.” US two party system equivalent divorced parents hating kids stuck middle; citizens kids never win.... spreading FUD. great news. Read! Holy shit! Winter going fucking brutal much stupidity running amuck. Stealing think know. one listening mom dead. SCREW politicians morons whining freedom. im betting herd mentality. America shockingly exceptional ""He martyr freedoms!""

/s, natch Texas still surging? pre-requisite understanding acceptance evolution, 40% Americans deny. MERS similar incubation period, much deadlier. can’t assume virus weaken. Virulence factors sometimes drive transmissibility. whataboutism guy. said ""China light world darkeness"". pointing actively committing genocide whataboutism, unless thinking committing genocide nothing ""light world""

here's challenge you. Go Washington DC run around saying trump fascist removed office. go Beijing say ""Tiananmen Square happened government killed people"". Let know work you. Trunks told us 2 Androids May 12th appear hopefully recovers part herd mentality. Trump literally said CoVid affects virtually one rally day. 200K dead thinks impacted us much. honestly insane statistic Probably fucked enough first time came back continued work. We're talking heart ling brain damage here. third cousins second husband also tested positive. equate deadly result infections? directly deadly deadly increased ability ""poison"" people. 

I.e sniper deadly rounds yet net kills people firering bullets. Effectively he's ""more deadly."" THIS!!!! going see article every positive case now? dad is, he's not. dad rolling eye point. think ethics how/who testing gave consent Personal accountability karma. envy Fauci. Imagine restraint needed put belligerent politicians every day talking nonsense encouraging people wrong thing. Parents need flogged death. Uh oh another table. Next thing know people saying proves covid causes pregnancy. currently running issue. high school missed almost week school sick been, COVID don’t know is. Think fever, coughing fits(my asthma horrible), colored mucus, etc. school person completely. can’t take sick days without getting serious trouble school. told stay home sick get many days allowed miss. Dude comment nothing vaccine? responded guy saying China ""the light world dark times"" lol. many fucking CCP agents thread? also.

Big money. Much stonkery. Merely pointing hypocrisy US concentration camps sterilize minority groups I’ve read shouldn’t trust unsourced claims online... 

You’re still ignoring unlike pandemic, world governments actually worked conceal true nature pandemic end war. Bullshet, way works. gonna die know....this sub obsessed it....they love circle jerks too. kind want see millions adults tolerate vaccine give me.  first test false positive, happening time beginning. another one? Bro never said America perfect lol. nice rebuke Uigher comment made. oh wait response talk shit America does.   true sub circle jerk state, taking benefit pregnancy/having baby, included  upstairs neighbors thing. hear kid coughing almost every night past week. That's necessarily true. may require one specific specialty state, every physician worked maintained respective board certifications letting boards lapse huge no.

If board certified specialist really expensive private practice every institution I've worked paid board certification part larger HCP, University, etc. Spending 500-1500 dollars lot money specialist making 250k - 400k hospitals, HCPs universities require certain number CMEs every year credentialing well. mention certifications ACS say Level 1 Trauma center. trauma related specialties require certain number trauma specific related CMEs certain time period one largest bulks CMEs get typically boards. Organizations American Board Surgery American College Surgeons. lmao nice whataboutism

I waiting say this... considering literally performed first ""whataboutism"" brought oh wait, banned you

I'm American, moron. history far darker nations. We've performed eugenics, genocides, etc. came see someone would find way blame trump....didnt take long. don’t need giant building huge staff that, though way Well definitely fence. told we’d honor ever wished. wanted. nice rejoice illness somebody
 Maybe covid bring governor senses.
God willing.
Oxala say Portuguese.
Inshalla say Arabic. usual situations. Remember kept trying expose impeachment whistleblower? That’s true. do, rate observed covid.  can’t assume operate assumption outcomes similar . That’s pretty dangerous position take given rate occurring. wasn’t big deal, I’m pretty sure someone like Fauci would made statement.  love Fauci wrecked follow dumbest shit. It’s still bunch strangers tin knows around knows who. Nice try Dr. Rockso... Hanoi's population size new York. Although say surprised new York population density Hanoi feels like everyone living top way less. (not many high buildings though comparison). don’t space 😊 I'm BC, hello fellow Canadian!

I'm health expert all, much less covid expert. covid spread droplets contaminated surfaces quick google search looks like there's evidence saying spread sweat. sucking body parts fine, I'm health expert take word it, enough studies available make informed decision do. 

Personally, I'm sex somebody would kissing them. think telling people kiss sex unrealistic silly. I'd make sure feel symptoms symptoms, make sure neither us around anyone known virus, feel blessed cases high places. I’d could live apartment don’t type space. small galley kitchen. Sen. Rand absolute CUNT human chances dying covid several orders magnitude higher involved airline accident, much less dying one.

Your mental perception risk warped. controlled March April could back lives like Europe Asia. I've met lot people really good memorizing shit, limited critical thinking abilities. really understand point. believe people moved around globe WWI travel 2020.? He’s also physician. immature, unethical. It’s amazing always someone complain things. 

Thousands aircraft sky isn’t enough? want killjoy effort revive industry. Nooo, strip clubs! That's data showing. schools source infection reopen immediately. Tired coworkers spending half day fucking around virtual learning getting kids ready next class. Plus kids barely getting sick it. anyone ages 2 15 died? That's right! Give hell, Dr. Fauci. inconsiderate me. must allow aquire yachts! cost! really looking for, show roundabout way. per capita risk per county: anyone else think reads like advertisement Oracle cloud computing? sleep tight baby ready follow whatever instructions give tomorrow Awesome! news, water wet sky sometimes blue. Yea. course does. Yet sub claiming tens thousands students would dead weeks totally doom gloom. 

And they're mad they're wrong. fucked Pretty rich coming guy pioneered “states rights” modern Republican party lmao

Fuck Barry Goldwater. Haha know find those... Eye doctor vs physician essentially solution worse problem. I'd never get death trap would prevent escape case fire accident. researchers places like Oxford cdc saying data good.

As dictatorial yes freedom press etc great. chances stopping Vietnamese neighbourhood gossiping news spreading way deaths would impossible. Ivan Drago saying. I'm Ontario. recommend wearing masks. guess kissing would bad. sucking body parts? Would sucking licking vagina bad? that's probably risk Makes sense. believe attenuated vaccine way go COVID-19. Hope die he's right I'm surprised many deaths still getting daily since second spike occurred Canada definitely building necessary rehab mental health centres, all.  Interestingly physicians trade.  Fair enough, keep mind everything Netflix 4k quality. 

I've noticed big difference watching stuff trial apple tv+ WSJ articles skew towards Covid countermeasures bad economy. juxtaposition article video embedded (restrictions precautions, Covid itself) bad local economies. WSJ trying eat probably point. 2020 serving schadenfreude bucket. trouble drinking straws breathing time? No. Meth-ical cover it. Oh yeah, well dad works Nintendo. Yeah, Johnson &amp; Johnson one first agreements made. don’t even one AstraZenica yet. Maybe turned good thing...  Cool rant, still whataboutism.  schools meet accreditation standards everybody pass boards practice anyway. shit schools way. People go schools really want doctors space domestic med schools limited. much easier ways make money doctor. worked medical residents domestic Caribbean schools 15 years really cannot distinguish way. Back Pokémon red blue comment reminds old Doublemint Gum commercial. lol high quality? data goes mainstream beliefs masks low quality? nice myth falters.

Looks like countries full lockdown really controlling disease, surprise surprise. seems unlikely. save article example propaganda. Inject veins

Literally “wings” undermine much even worse West (remember Nguyen Ba Thanh?). Honestly it’s different U.S. drama still there, injustice still there, like anywhere else world. I’d say biggest difference lack freedom speech, that’s all. also effective vaccine circulation. men's bathroom seems indicate many people exist. im conditioned rest sheeple really hate living Missouri Lmao 

It kind feels like humanity one big flight nowhere sometimes. Oh gosh, brilliance Trump's Bay Pigs award stack dead either way. many people died nursing homes kept alive people going visit them? many people died mental health crisis? many died heart attacks fear getting virus, thus getting checkup otherwise would have? hear doctors stories patients across country, scary worrying many neglecting health issues far higher risk killing due fear drummed virus. saying virus isnt scary, weigh 450 pounds, heart condition, things pressing dangerous require medical viewing.  


People dying result shutdown, riddle this. amount end matter what. already reached community spread, reached community spread likely even heard it. difference Republican States stacking dead once, stacking longer period time. 3000 people die month, looks terrible. 3000 die year, 3000 people, looks less terrible, died. covered medi-cal? sorry interrupt. get it. happens throw spaghetti wall? true meth overdoses. die using medical meth, meant pass surrender flesh infinite beings Earth Kingdom. 

Now go medical meth. standing behind President nodding head agreement everything thing said, like constant nodding. UC Boulder traced basically zero covid cases campus in-person classes. 

It's almost like people put shit ton time money making something safer require people wear masks virus spread easily. Every new infection possibility new strain.  Always been....

(Click, click) According latest data, 36% intensive care beds occupied Covid-19 patients Madrid region, compared national average 16%

Pablo Linde
Madrid - 23 sep 2020 - 10:29 CEST

The new figures coronavirus crisis Spain increasingly resembling seen peak pandemic March April. According official report released last night Spanish Health Ministry, 241 deaths added official toll – second highest figure second wave Covid-19. fatalities, however, took place last 24 hours. number also includes coronavirus deaths happened earlier dates yet added official toll. first wave, Spain recorded 950 deaths day, using reporting method.
-

The Health Ministry recorded 10,799 new coronavirus cases official report released Tuesday. cannot compared number infections first wave, given Spain greater capacity detect new cases. before, health authorities carrying tests serious infections; also detecting minor asymptomatic cases.
-

  number coronavirus cases rises, number patients requiring hospitalization intensive care

The percentage hospital beds occupied coronavirus patients also risen 9.6%. situation worse intensive care units (ICUs). Tuesday, Health Ministry published first time ICU occupancy rate Spain: 16.8% intensive care beds Spain occupied Covid-19 patients. figure varies greatly regions. La Rioja highest rate 56.7%, followed Madrid (36.3%) Aragón (32.5%). regions lowest occupancy rate Galicia (4.48%), Asturias (4.53%), Extremadura (8.79%) Canary Islands (9.15%). remaining regions 10% ICU beds occupied coronavirus patients. Importantly too, occupancy rate based core number ICU beds available also extensions services.
-

This data point key ultimately determines scope severity measures aimed curbing contagion. ICUs overwhelmed, authorities choice introduce drastic measures bid ease pressure. happened spring, entire Spanish economy “hibernated” prevent ICUs reaching breaking point.

The state Spain’s ICUs reflect, weeks difference, rise diagnosed coronavirus cases. infections detected March – many minor asymptomatic – number cases rises, number patients requiring hospitalization intensive care.

  cumulative incidence Covid-19 Madrid risen 746.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, compared national average 287.7

The epidemic continues rise almost Spain’s 17 regions. Madrid continues highest 14-day cumulative incidence Covid-19, 746.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, followed Navarre (622.7), surge cases; La Rioja (444.5); Aragón (388.1), numbers risen weeks-long downward trend; Castilla-La Mancha (383.6), also seen sharp spike infections. national average 287.7. region incidence rate 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants Asturias (98.26), lowest rate Spain, followed Galicia (114.4) Valencia (115).

While regions lowest incidence rate Spain, still far European countries: Germany (24.9), Italy (32.1), United Kingdom (69.1) Portugal (80.8). Europe, trend rise, particularly France 182.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. It’s sad you’ve brainwashed anti-China propaganda. China lot problems holding foreigner hostage one them. Right reality new disease can't yet predict. Prepare worst, hope best. He’s taking one team. 5G show youbwhere going outbreak..... I’ve said I’ll say again, doctors merely people memorized bunch shit. really whips llama's ass. make sense. China first Europe usa heels 2. usa first ? realize china usa can't first together ? Donnie approve ;-) Haha drove state (by necessity) couldn’t believe non existent mask rules throughout state. Shocking. lol wut? Many highly intelligent people simply switch brains thinking certain topics, like religion, romance politics. many people calling hoax? president called hoax. understand care context. said done huge damage USA around world. [major vaccine none use attenuated vaccines. bet it. Don’t scare I’m dreading November easier make stores spray disinfectant make people wear masks certain people media authority figures gave dismissed constantly .. 

Even media figures begged first son law team n95 authority chief everyone constantly tested covid-19 wearing mask according daughter/advisor test early incubation period negative. incubation period median 5 days, 14, test right tell much - even negative could get symptoms days.

So, stay isolated, that's best option. get tested bit later, leaving isolation. leave isolation, get tested later. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA...... He’s piece human garbage decades point

The fact prominent political figure America genuine joke dolts think getting COVID gonna change anything? might right, it’s gonna make bunker overblown survives 2-4 weeks. Vile people want bad things happen bad people help people become good people Sweden's 7-day rolling average 249 cases. herd immunity doesnt mean new cases suddenly stop. practice means R0 cant go 1 specific geographic area exponential growth wont occur. Probably hopefully coincidental. Good hitting gym! Yes  hate needs every one. would like remind Italy went hard lockdown almost three months suffered 35k deaths, still counting btw, people dying ones healthy. know griefing really believe either way look really stupid right  Holy shit, idea that. Explains MUCH. means, *idiot* Americans, fucking **economy**


Your *economy* crippled this. he/she got wrong, 2nd highest raw hospitalization, after... California, state population. 


Serious question though: still spank call Shirley? “Surprisingly it’s big number might think might room 1,000 people, number people literally 15 minutes, right next them, actually smaller number,” Williams said...

Bunch idiots. ""less 15 minutes exposed infected"" rule virus.

He'll probably one lucky ones experience mild symptoms most, meaning change mind severity virus. Even Phase III ongoing, EUA granted favorable preliminary results. read way! 😄 700k confirmed; what's that, 5M real? Maybe 20% population already positive? Still long way go get true herd immunity probably enough impact number cases significantly relaxed social distancing place. Yea, healthcare workers families getting vaccinated going seriously help. Girlfriend RN immunocompromised already talked boss us getting vaccinated ASAP, basically told first wave. find bit confusing really. Recently live Vietnam recently talking American colleague mask wearing told ""As American government level control"" seems somewhat skewed thinking. 

Everyone Vietnam told wear mask wash hands did, lockdown hard two weeks (in general areas far loner quarantines). everyone going day, wear masks. Want go bar? problem, spent weekend sitting pool drinking beers guesthouse bunch friends.

Meanwhile countries like USA &amp; UK (where from), want controlled forced wear mask. What's net result that?

* Longer lockdowns. 
* Higher restrictions do.
* Limits gatherings. 
* holidays.

So sorry correct me, ones given control right now; Vietnam, US, UK? Indeed. bother, dumb going keep vomiting dumb. trust numbers positives trust positivity rates, believe, also falling. trust positivity rates basically saying numbers made up, rather system manipulated limit testing availability (which would plausible positivity rates rose). that's case, even limit testing: make shit up.

And definitely take Covid seriously, I'm allergic good news. new cases went up, deaths stayed low, idiots saying cases matter different now, people taking seriously saying deaths would follow delay. Well guess - rise death rates delayed compared rise cases, fall.  It’s almost like workplaces punish taking care sick kids, give paid time so, shit show have

I forget reality lot countries have. normal thing home sick kid 80% pay occur people can't this. Man clueless. T-Cell/B-Cells produced infection memory cells better recognize antigen future mount immune response - aka immunity. Even though antibodies may fade.

That still means 80% infection required herd immunity. articles support brainfart position. kind science support that? it’s pretty obvious Covid ran way rampantly Italy New York that’s recovered best. kind government restrictions, strong evidence support communities harshest lockdowns actually suffer worst. success came spreading throughout community fully. people going get sick die got sick died. Mostly old sick people didn’t much time left anyway know now. communities went better part. science prove heard immunity doesn’t work I’d love see definitely evidence prove work. SARS Covid way. Terrible comparison. Obviously good news wave peaked, presumably statistical recoveries only, i.e., person got sick three weeks ago (or whatever), currently hospital dead, presume they're fine - which, vast majority cases, would be. Dr. Fauci needs add “bless heart” polite insult list. Again, GOP, political idiots work! Everyone calm hasn’t even approved yet Yeah one progenitors Trumpism saint. 

sure thing tagged ""africa"" saudi's literally asia believe mean propaganda dying.... ""No.""

""You've misconstrued Senator done repetitively past."" Gee, another person get one's health issues OWN.

Stopping(/controlling) virus may add onto people's health conditions something person do. going ""infected"" 450 pound person causing gain amount end matter what.

WHAT??? amount since happen know? done start (total shutdown) done even get people responsible opposed behaving (parties, types large gatherings, tired never worn wear masks, loose hygenics, ...), think would OBVIOUS ""same amount"" would actually change.

It hard think (one would hope) completely isolated island, would get infected/die virus compared make every viral patient NY/Italy peak. crazy got downvoted Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump 🤞 confirming parejts use public schools waiting room sick children therefore exposing children therefore exposing families thusly endangering health 7.8~ billion people? 🤔 Update: going lie definitely sucks worse first shot. feel first one took Tylenol dull still feel same. I’ve awake since 230 can’t get comfortable. head, back, legs, even one foot achy. strangest thing got take Tylenol last night around 10 PM felt intense wave nausea immediately go lay back down. feel ok front morning least. Still totally worth gets us working vaccine. many obese 65 year olds survived many don’t even symptoms.

This true, like many people played Russian roulette lived. start planning funeral they've pulled trigger - Covid same, takes bit longer. know US DEA death penalty don’t you. Go become drug addict parents would proud. am, drive tests 4 hour wait, 3 days result, cost $30. rand paul witting agent Trump’s rubber stamp senate, he’s worth breath dr. Fauci Heard immunity without vaccine impossible, give type immunity original SARS That's 5% side effect, full question bad side effect are. OK get sore shoulder 24h willing end-up stuck bed awful headache 3 days. course, GOP'er! fuck sake stop stupid pleasure sake people’s health. thanks inside scoop Bill, would never ever thought . . . again. Man humans disgusting. I’m sure it’s wearing masks social distancing ran community like Italy New York Sweden right? Riiight. already know vaccine useless there's heard immunity without it, basically looking ten years restrictions let go wild next pandemic happen temperature taken? read next sentence used car salesman epidemiology. 

You would context see means. guy gives distinct impression sketchy. describing physical presence physical appearance. article skipping prenatal care COVID, it’s always mother’s idea desire so. wanted clarify good fetal movement doesn’t necessarily mean things fine. mean. parent shitty teenager gives lets whatever want whenever throw temper tantrum, call bad parents. Brush teeth, mouthwash, smell minty fresh! Wait... means nobody dies meth... Wow, solved major societal problem sentences. I'm impressed. Wait, also get rid AIDS. Nobody dies AIDS either. pesky opportunistic infections right? FLU!, great, flu. Everybody dies Pneumonia... Dementia patient nuclear launch codes No, really. use surgical masks forget lot times. cloth masks quite restricting. Asked Wednesday whether time statewide mask mandate, Parson’s health director deferred decisions local “We think you’re draconian everywhere … it’s almost creates problems solves,” Williams said.

Yeah? problems wearing mask create? Specify them. *Enumerate* them. Now, **health director**, compare problems wearing mask solves. I’m sure “knows” true Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* “He's treating current status victory, like ~~Trumpleton~~ Trumpelstiltskin gave 'A' day response virus.

/ftfy ... referring troll underlying this, right? Keep telling that's keeps sane Freedumb! still one group people refusing wear masks. Since takes two operative brain cells look evidence rationally decide wear mask, must strange motivation risk life others...

If could figure unites them? maybe voting November would provide clues... Inaccurately? Unlikely. Remember death count still lower due purposeful fuckery. I'm wondering Demon Sperm involved certification process...  Lmao, much butt hurt rand New York greatest. Ok? Parents seem care, teachers do. Parents losing minds kids home, justification place kids others danger virus. Losing containment messures means dead boomers. rest us get boost mental health abd return normality. 

The virus spread unmitigated month's containment yet piles dead young people... Fauci far behind science topic herd immunity. Multiple lines research coming conclusion herd immunity would achieved 20-40% (plus regional variability) way back March. time, somewhat excusable ignorant topic really experienced pandemic proportion century. point though, simply inexcusable continue peddling 70-80% nonsense. assume order manipulate personal actions, similar lied effectiveness masks. Hey let's huge motorcycle rally! governor SD probably. Sure keep telling China saying virus dangerous.

But March China lockdown hundreds millions people, built 2 new hospitals. Put everyone positive test immediate isolation, separating families. also sent 30000 doctors nurses country help region around Wuhan.

It described ""draconian"" European media, China took seriously, simply ignored that.

It confusing little European governments prepare lax rules contact tracing was.

But government said: reason cancel skiing trips Italy, go ahead! return, reason isolate even test everyone returning.

The blame find encourage mask wearing everyone lack masks. 

Only first three weeks Januari clear virus spreading deadly was, normal new virus. wasted every opportunity stop virus still handling should.

The recently said expect 20% people worldwide vaccinated end 2021.
20% enough, still need distance least another year follow example East Asia...

Bigger homes, lower population density, less public transport use, US open tourism, people work home, distance learning either.

I aware. Italy still state emergency Spain lifted due pressure opposition parties June. open nightclubs believe (something NY either might explain they're much better say Madrid).

Quite clearly: transparency, cooperation, communication and: education! crucial population well clearly informed precautionary measures understood followed myths spread.

Haha. that’s call ‘being offended’ you’ve got life experiences go r/leopardsatemyface find hard trust current FDA, hopefully February that's longer issue. many countries approve vaccine I'll trust it.

Honestly, person probably never getting vaccine. Ah yes. oversimplification 2 extremes. Also American. Oh, know. Family MN view WI backwards hillbilly shithole. Maybe don’t listen people listening to? term ""virus-related death"" used before, slow move towards ""only 4% deaths actually caused virus"" narrative? idea everyone orgasming. 90% world's population Covid, including left home since March people anti-maskers. long get treated complications, harm shame healthy person get it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* pointless someone gained enjoyment it.  Whatever say man Watch they’ll go crazy daring say H word (herd immunity) seems many people love lockdowns, anti social lifestyle, destroying economy would rather end free world know want dictator like Gaddafi rule tell free prosperous wrong poor enslaved right seems diverse. look policies see share strong similarities policies. Also sometimes choice came lesser two evils. candidate leaned slightly towards policies cared got nod, even were, opinion, awful. 

Also, said above, since R share lot similarities policies, *to same.* Yes differences, areas care about.

One important positions fiscal conservatism. last fiscally conservative president Clinton. neither candidate appears fiscally conservative, one next important qualifications social programs. we're gonna blow money, I'd rather see go towards people, corporations. Another important quality avoiding unnecessary war. Bush went war lost chance vote 2nd term. Obama promised fix didn't, lost vote too. Ron Paul *seemed* fiscally conservative, seemed want end wars overseas, believe non intervention states rights. pro abortion states becoming diverse different laws, like allowing states abortion illegal. believe diversity, negative regards would positive regards. believe could learn positive outcomes improve states. hated candidates 2016 wanted vote person thought best, even though longer running. year hate Trump see Biden near equal *in issues care about.* I'd rather 4 years Trump done risk potential 8 years Biden. concern age Biden, mental health. expect die surprised did. think Kamala Harris would make horrible president. last time happy president Clinton. see presidents shit, different flavors shit, parties tend look you. afford lose it.

I wouldn’t tell lies jeopardise lives health keep job. sympathy politician does. Well it’s kind big deal.


Also yes. longer charge Microsoft doesn’t work anymore. devoted time money fighting big issues like disease. go communism Yes, beginning meant death's

I honestly think beginning mostly reacting way slowly virus lot people going hotspots alps Iran. got huge spread Stockholm putting guidelines even reacting all.

Then again, never see brought possible reason many deaths got early reason. like everyone assumes every country exact conditions exact time. Ah, anti Intellectual, makes sense given viewpoint. hate science dafa much? Oh right forgot 787 burn fuel. flys magically. Wait, US GOVERNMENT spends healthcare would universal healthcare?

Wouldn't make universal healthcare fiscally conservative thing do? hero America deserve, hero America need r/leopardsatemyface joke republicans won’t wear mask adhere common sense practices therefore outbreaks red zip codes, creating electoral map. 

Don’t think hard. laugh move day. 2 doses? Admittedly easier meet people learn network (which definitely important), less likely get teacher like ""Ok guys need grade correct other's work"", like.... even know I'm want grade someone else's stuff? What? They're teacher teacher work?

And less likely get distracted different environment get different headspace work need to. Online classes hard, though also yeeears ago also lot tech updates still imagine there's also still base problems get past 

BUT... Getting sick Thanks, correct it.  UK seems willing break international laws get want something else unethical problem either. Indeed Needs made blanket mandatory unless someone get extremely compelling medical exemption. Zero religious personal exemptions. Yes, Rand Paul board certified physician, top tier medical education (Duke). He's playing outside field right (infectious diseases). clearly shows problem privatized elderly care. social safety net...Ofcourse happens blame yet. Maybe masks. actually poll saying women cared covid general. forget Andy Bernard.  fair, I'm jokey Caribbean med schools. There's doctor shortage US variety reasons. Caribbean med schools produce board certified physicians, many work underserved areas (because top tier hospitals tend take residents top tier med schools, leaving community hospitals short staffed). live NYC, near Lincoln Center, Caribbean med schools hold graduation ceremonies (the last two years med school clinical rotations around associated hospitals; schools, generally NYC placements). nice sight. man, tested positive, could hard headed dumbass. dare post result ahead November... blame lies squarely govt.

And hoaxers, antivaxxers, conspiracy nuts anyone morons wear masks want to. wanted alpha. need slapped. Vaccination one- two-off Thats simplyfying. Time time again, government admitted failing protect elderly, seem acknowledge failure built system though.

I think Tegnell FHM even aware badly carehomes run. Reinfections thing No, flip coin know happens Let us realistic. COVID virus end near future. drawn reasonable conclusions based understanding viruses epidemics. technical hardly adds much appreciation huge capability nature.

Covid-19 disease caused SARS-COV-2 virus. virus shown contagious short incubation period humans. pandemic however end able appreciate get idea virus prominent properties. however continue get sporadic outbreaks possibly seasonal patterns.

You reliable vaccine small pox polio. COVID RNA virus likes mutate quite comfortably. worst aggression tone taking toll hundreds thousands elderly twisting world economy like never before. Humans would learn live virus like nasty flu bug hit every season. comorbidities continue pay heavier price .

Let us brief glimpse virus. happily living exotic creatures ended unwittingly human host humans pretty much like cockroaches comes food habits. mean aggressive happily living previous natural host. humans found easy multiply spread largely contact. preventive measure social distance, masks hand wash related aspect.

Unfortunately new host (human) found virus uncomfortable leading significant morbidity mortality. mutation perhaps took place would pipeline.
This mutation make aggressive less aggressive. 

The second prospect preferable behaviour viewpoint parasite. point vicious kill host survive outside prey. evolutionary follows rules survival.

Vast majority infected survive infection build degree immunity. survive largely elderly preexisting comorbidities. Perhaps classic survival fittest raw form.

The think tanks Boris Johnson Donald Trump considered preferred option. hoping mortality long period prepared this. economic argument made sense. However thinkers got one tiny aspect wrong. virus turned rather aggressive short incubation period taking serious toll senior citizens. 
Italy Spain showed crazy could get, overwhelming health service. UK USA lock down. bit late better late never.

The idea gradual spread would take place, allows health service cope best facilities. would go years largely serious effect elderly. economic terms acceptable.
The herd immunity would develop benefit one variety flu bug choose! 

The Covid virus end humans learn live sacrificing reduced ability fight majority rest develop immunity. Every season expect thousands depart bodies years come due losing battle SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Drugs vaccines long way terms cure prophylaxis. drugs help recovery clogged lungs kill virus. body's immune system actual task fighting invader. Drugs likely help, extent, available widely. Rapid mutations makes vaccines hard great efficiency hence great use.
Poorer nations fragile economies would otherwise pay huge price.

The understanding world know, made relentless pursuit wealth regardless means. questioned while. Expect things go back usual years, followed plus version COVID due course!

It end world though humans overestimate ability importance grand scheme universe! Humans totally expendable nature decides enough.

Live due respect nature odds humans lead happier healthier life perhaps longer well. statement may spiritual philosophical leaning easily backed boring studies:)
We silently watched nature ravaged indiscriminately humans. easy bit cynical humans like think know best! Sadly silent majority pay price. minority make noises little impact.

Also, downplaying vitus, talks ""flockimmunitet"" (herd immunity) soon, help people taking seriously enough.

It's shameful happened Sweden, hope ones responsible punished crimes. That's stretch. Paul Sr corporatism taken United States faster. say cause Trumpism without giving context... quite frankly bullshit. even know vaccines give immunity long, that's without considering fact current vaccines designed two doses two shots Although denied Swedish strategy bad flu. doesn’t track numbers. Almost every study shown case counts underestimated dramatically true number 8-13 times official count. Even take low number there, 8 * 7 million 56 million 17% pre-pandemic US population. 83%, max, population still susceptible. upper end existing infection history scale, 27.5% pre-pandemic US population, 91 million, 72.5% susceptible.

That’s nowhere near herd immunity, 90% susceptible basis logic data Wrong sub 😂 anyone’s wondering it’s optional btw less lethal? Yearly shot like flu shot Move on. u r replying query. Laugh want left significantly higher inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP, PCT, ferritin)

But wait theres more...According New York Times, potentially 90 percent tested positive COVID-19 insignificant amounts virus present bodies individuals need isolate candidates contact tracing. Leading public health experts concerned overtesting responsible misdiagnosing huge number people harmless amounts virus systems.

So worth it. ? Mask wearing civil liberties suspended, lockdowns, 50 million unemployed , economy destroyed. Soon food shortages, hyperinflation. 
Sounds totally worth me. 

For 9,210 deaths 90% false positive wrong.

Notes briefing (still updated):

* Patients ICU 18 - figure days now.
* actually +3 new deaths registered since yesterday (one death corrected since last report, namely really old addition yesterday 7/8 removed). new deaths 11/9, 21/9 22/9.

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

How ironic, defending oneself lies. real player anyone? maybe stop projecting quite much That's great, fucking happening, interesting piece.

But percentage American people vaccinated, mask goes. apologize imo. already fined. owe anyone apology lol ""you're wearing wrong"" then... /shrug/

Just twist side straps. son small head, twist side straps couple times snugs right up.

But whatever, you... mean, ""erased"" years progress, inadequate response was...

Some morons still taking seriously. Makes sense actually, way. People forced hunker take safety precautions whenever possible.  talking ""thr true extent"" virus, whether existed all. Either way, seems like second wave coming. Pray vaccine wave crests. hate see it. matter us take it! pull ANYTHING said comments? Pure fabrication.

Covid big deal, also death sentence people pretend is. mostly likely die due Covid: FACT. UNDENIABLE FACT. Even old, fat people likely die it.

A comment pointing downvoted, downvoted goes fear mongering sub likes do. 

You guys say care people, flat true I've never said anything similar that. fabricated based nothing, like people sub love fabricate fear.

This sub also hates favcts goes fear, even fact matter governor likely (by WIDE margin) okay this. post pointing fact downvoted, thus initial response.

Grow stop making bullshit make feel superior others. Actually don’t feel like caring anyone especially people like you, prefer live life enjoy , pretty young probably covid like flu me. virus mortality less 0.4% people still scared, enjoy pathetic loner life, atleast got excuse staying home 24/7. shouldn’t. explosion cases New York occurred radar anyone really understood happening. 

At point significant portion world’s population taking appropriate precautions slow growth outbreaks. I’ve seen Facebook titles like, “Rand Paul Destroys Fauci” comment nothing mine all.

""Tight filter front nose mouth"" =/= sealed like N95. surgical mask practically hanging face...it ain't helping giant amount either. There’s inner New Yorker! new him. Using gate metaphore.

Something like happened months ago Washington State.  *did* lock state activate National Guard testing response? urge people wear masks? hoping would kill people get votes, too? push further, exercising imagination see absolute worst others, justifying lack empathy potential death. Idk, seems doable level. least airports. fast, immediate results. agree. healthcare outreach women great emulated men well. 

The system telling men they're bad employees taking time see doctor, they're better ignore pain, etc. end we'll start seeing equal health outcomes men. acting like know talking about? always confuses people it, ego? Press release.

Numbers look good face it; small trial long period. honest, think sad many people died, time I've also grown numb it. Nothings gonna change till get new leadership top. assuming 82k cases per day way reality probably hundred thousand cases day. 

There way country complexity economic development level India keep pandemic. hope economic development accelerate make difficult couple years. Corruption erased decades progress plans continue so. pandemic exposed countries built operated corruption. Fauci’s anger translator would great sketch. Corona tests positive Zlatan Yes. I’ve seen that. test theory methodically re-opening society watch case counts. That’s doing. still don’t see public policy change (besides vaccination strategy one’s available) pursue models. virus peters peters out. Treasonous psychopath So: best way handle education.

How educate rednecks every single Mask Ad Facebook say ""masks sheeple"" without wanting reach screen punch lights out?

How government that? handle education communities even NYC figure ""eh we're fine"" starting new hotspots throwing big weddings using masks ""religious reasons""? r/LeopardsAteMyFace totally.  Disband TSA please live Missouri. warms heart. Hope fucker dies. hope wife’s ok. doubt many places reaching herd immunity, doubt 22% reasonable estimate. knows? broad spectrum infection monitoring reporting! appear relatively deaths African countries. may obvious reasons this. Firstly, age profile: population simply younger. hand, immune system used many infections. Worm infections, example, universal there. affect immune system. know exact effect specific COVID-19 virus disease, could explanation.

This really interesting. Certain areas world experiencing much lower impacts expected seem talked much. Could anti-malarial treatments commonly take? Ivermectin? simply exposure genetic factors? Again?? Anyone surprised ? many ICU visits deaths?

The anti-maskers would say number irrelevant effecting ppl worse flu.

They would say reporting cases &amp; positives irrelevant. question consequences? Sniffly nose week? cares?

So I'm dying (no pun intended) stats go beyond ""positives."" saw people arguing herd immunity US back July, ridiculous stuff people believe. 10 years old realized wasn’t actually pronounced way. Thanks dad 😆🙄 Offices too. want get rid programs, would training dogs detect disease. mean think billions spending develop technology detect COVID, spit, getting swabs stuck nose poked needles 60-70% effective test. Instead could pet dog get 98% accurate result.

I say bring dogs. 

Sometimes, think overthink overengineer things. Whats difference fool wise man?

A fool learns doing, wise man learns watching others.

The GOP epitome foolishness. It’s like Jin Yangs hotdog not-hotdog app. dog either smells food smells not-food restrictions disappear next year regardless fatigue general public.

Continual lockdown good job collapsing countries too. way brit moral superior end enslaved half world ironic karmic justice receiving right apt

Well given I'm centuries old, believe nothing slave trade, weird flex. Especially every countries history full heinous, uncomfortable acts. 

So kinda psychotic think Britain's dying karmic justice slight people longer alive stupidity pre-existing condition?  herd mentality! one ever said it'll last coronavirus pandemic potential.

Who knows? years might see another virus like COVID-19. [This *not* going last pandemic *hate* term ""once-in-a-lifetime"" describe pandemic. do? *Lock again!* [We known efficacy lockdown strategy [but I’m happy got sick, hope gets better. However, maybe take seriously, first-hand experience COVID-19. majority young infected people asymptomatic end hospital. Yeah (I'm French)  testing million day almost 90k positives you, sir6, get dictate feel wasteful certainly get dictate opinions cannot post social media platform.

There much people inherently wasteful *you* see wasteful mean wasteful. where's list people masks got covid ? That’s def wrong zoom. 

Have u tried singing happy birthday zoom? It’s fucking disaster  Canadian province... recover. I'm half joking. Last week Sweden performed 140.000 test. Denmark currently performing 55.000 tests *per day* 559 testing positive.

So, would correspond 675.000 tests per week Sweden, given difference population size, calculated 7\*55000\*(10,2/5,8).

Which yields (6,75/1,5)\*533 = 2.400 cases pr. day Sweden tested like Denmark.

553 new cases Denmark corresponds 559\*(10,2/5,8) = 983 cases Sweden.

2400 cases Sweden would correspond 2400/(10,2/5,8)= 1.366 cases here.

So actually, I'd say Sweden shit creek feeling Denmark situation tipping point is. nothing say mods would consider civil... recently attempt assassinate alt-right nutjob. Lots people Alberta hates even hate father, policies focus Ontario Quebec Alberta. know smell, maybe could help scientists figure chemical causes smell? remember reading woman could smell Parkinson's husband [she helped hone cause smell. Well follow rules happens cannot feel bad rules keep us safe 

Their consequences actions good bad good luck hope makes thru disease learned lesson Multiple Turkey rate 10 comment general statement (Trump, Bolsonaro, Duerte, Johnson, ..), true.

Though I'd argue electoral college *another* US-centric issue top popularity contest issue. fact Trump able even reach presidential election alone telling. Searching articles older April Google returns results articles published March 5^(th), 3^(th) even January 2^(nd)... follow said links either end article hours/days ago, unrelated articles older dates link Mark Wahlberg one. 

That's weird. I’ve reached point wishing people like die. I’m monster don’t care anymore. sick tired fucks taking advantage better people. doesn’t deserve live. scientific data constantly received, findings evolve often contradict previous findings.


To morons hate nuance (you), confusing. Makes sense seems likely Trump push vaccine prior election unless companies FDA stand him. Scariest much damage idiot done. 

You forgot word. He’s still tweeting read found yesterday cousin Iowa going college tested positive it. Well, dies I'm sure anything COVID. age looking like he's got least 2.3 comorbidities covid count. cannot name honest one, therein lies answer. Go read book ¿Por que los dos? One ""guy"" who, stupidity inaction cause thousands people get preventable virus.

So no, random guy. getting word hypocrasy normal, not-insane time could save thousands lives. keep right spinning. 1.5 degree temperature increase 2024. many years progress, really. I'm US. least was. ""The new report find mutations made virus deadlier. viruses accumulate genetic mutations, insignificant, scientists say. Coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, causes illness covid-19, relatively stable viruses go, proofreading mechanism replicate.""

Phew. really thing ""minority areas"" Taiwan... cities pretty dense... furthermore, article said many caregivers means take care old people, interact family, go shopping, etc. Young healthy Filipino's carrying virus, old weak grandmas push around day aren't? Twenty-five years progress vaccine coverage disappeared 25 weeks.

Does anyone know refers? Seems like freestanding statement without explanation can't parse it. Clinical trials randomized studies also confirmed sniffer dogs question 100% successful exhibiting traits / symptoms *optimus puer* (or ""such good boy"" layman's terms) genus. understand strategy, referring positions I've seen earnestly argued internet. makes sense due turn. I'm surprised numbers spiked sooner. again, lot recent cases prisons small towns. cities obviously lot cases, lot mask wearing taking virus seriously. *NO! FAKE NEWS!! TRUMP SAID YOUNG PEOPLE GET IT!! OPEN SCHOOLS!! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!!!*

And can't tell /s, check sanity humanity. 2000 2016, democracy worked. people chose objectively superior candidate unqualified demagogue appealed stupid. 2000 2016, authoritarian Electoral College catastrophically backfired, giving us objectively inferior demagogues qualified statesmen chosen people. Wow Trump great job... 🤦‍♂️ You’re right, it’s scam need dogs everywhere. Yes degree Rand Paul has, hence person saying ""he's fucking eye doctor"" considering separate medical community dumbass pre-existing conditions. problem America classless meritocratic society Earth. Problem average person smart as... average person. Thus, ""merit"" get ""good life"" rather ""average life"". America built around everyone acting like they're something special, one wants admit they're not. Covid 19, got sniffles went day. work company chance? envy time look stranger's post history effort anonymously insult them. PM actually want insult face. eMule KazAa easy (56k) free zic. That's okay Donald Dumpf erased years progress well. math would somewhat comforting - student testing mandatory, isn't. They're going random sampling, starting October.

Shit, IIRC - even staff testing mandatory, recommended. ramped testing, 100/2500 ratio would drastically different. Funny people see wearing mask wrong women showing nose.  vagina issue. Nah it’s matter dumb people matter sex. Detail hugely important. can't theoretically fight virus. 

It's obvious start Swedish strategy herd immunity. Tegnal denied herd immunity yet expressed surprise anti body tests returned low levels June. 

The contemplation lockdowns Stockholm confirms initial strategy ever experimental. currently national mask recommendation Norway, public transport within Oslo moment. infection rate still low masks “make difference”. Yes! counties listed different underlying health issues start with! USA fat. UK fat. Lombardy old. Population density important spread. Comorbidities cause deaths.  Thank lord everyone! Mandatory Moose here, let us know what's pointless life isn't.

Maybe tell carbon emissions dont care flying somewhere business meeting, pool party ""because"". dont think 4 people trolling topic understand basic science. less flights ever, handful going ""nowhere"" completely irrelevant anything SCIENTIFICALLY. Nah that’s BS. Lots docs (my father included), let slide later life settle somewhere stay. remember dad renewing boards around age 40. whole huge deal hated it! literally impossible. UBI makes VAT appear progressive poorest 30% simply means shifted regressive everyone regressive mostly middle class. can't consumption based tax make progressive. still tax designed hurt lower income people higher income people. would take Cuban vaccine. Oh, I've seen movie. end well. Obviously reinfection occurring sentence makes sense. Acquired protective immunity least people lasting much less 12 months.  don’t understand city experienced much death suffering pandemic would put children teachers risk. least wait months there’s preliminary vaccine opening.

Hopefully schools won’t shut down. Hear, hear! Breaks Sega Dreamcast  China also saying concentration camps. willing lie look good. lie this? Honestly, people brains? mention it, yes, remember hearing Spain plain-facts reporter it. hope right time around different enough. also see human nature fundamental factors - regardless specific factors - humans always respond late enough... late enough. time around complicated fact significant percentage asymptomatic, creating false sense calm. told Sweden won. everyone follow example!


Now want people working home, hugging friends!!!!


Muuuuhhhhhhh FRRRReeeeeeeddduuuummmbbbssss! me, always character ""The Big Hit"". Like, nice guy. disappointing. :(

Nice work masks though... small, could happen

Yep common cold kill people autoimmune problems. Better lock everyone case cold. Can't risk even one life...or risk high enough.. also chose what's high total what's not. I'm sure willing judge. don’t know downvoted. absolutely true. trouble getting test toddler two confirmed cases daycare attended. Even Doctors recommendation search around someone would test young kid. took week. places won’t test kid symptoms even probable exposure.

Also daycare school cases reported state information released public. didn’t report numbers, number added state Texas. litterally said arent considering lightening restrictions yeah.

For shit Sweden gets, probably rightfully, one thing done well never gave date restrictions lifted, also start claimed quite while. Basically kept sociatal fatigue growing large many places. Quick, call Captain Obvious! clueless must saved!! MSB/Kantar-Sifo Coronabarometer. 

Haha given number one priority months ago. way talk people, got life experiences go through. Damn. I’m lucky. def hard, it’s three hours. Lots independent work. can’t get much done, stay late. Super lack sleep. 


I’m worried teacher wife. kid’s whole fam Covid. still coming school symptoms. took test Monday doesn’t expect results Saturday. wife told principal. said wait positive test order anything. Meanwhile, she’s classes lunch dozens people since. mean, we'll still probably laughing WI afterward. ""Research SUGGESTS""? Iam her, somewhat true, feels good stay day home without _excuse_. Yeah, thought news march thats realistic

1. transporting higly conagious ICU patients hundreds thousands km problematic

2. cases rising throughout europe worse worse winter aproaches, countries really glad enough beds themselfs... Yes probably print. need go nearest research liberary.

MSB/Kantar-Sifo Coronabarometer. Latest 14/9. support 70%. Good luck

I'm great day. Thank you. U r generalizing much. Belgium Italy Spain many US states also worse death quotas Sweden per 1million inhabitants. u always end same. U can’t compare apples oranges 

What stands simple fact Sweden never locked new infections deaths going month that’s utter contrast UK Italy France , Denmark , Finland etc Hmm okay says teacher covid teacher it, guess meant student? I’ll go last time dealt someone like got butthurt reported offering unique opportunity experiencing something PM take L Mark wahlberg call racist. last part right- doesn’t support general argument. Excess deaths means excess expected. folks note would likely die year regardless already included baseline death forecast will. Consequences dumbass. thoughts prayers (and chuckles) House doused petrol burned quickly, longer flammable. read yesterday something still operas Madrid.. seems bit silly   comes decades working government. FFS rename corona party?

I think singing choir may single worst thing do: probably one easiest replicate Zoom really harmful activities. Got keep appearances. masculinity thing, though agree Ok don’t understand history you’re arguing that’s ok.

It called Spanish flu newspapers allowed report publicly Spain, neutral. Every country deliberately kept news flu suppressed didn’t want opposing sides gain tactical advantage. that, didn’t even bother separate troops sick troops pandemic well underway avoid arousing suspicion. Meaning millions men world spent months, living squalor, close contact others sick. know Spanish flu took exactly fall? World War 1 ended October millions men returned whatever corners world came from, many bringing virus them. literally perfect storm I’m sorry don’t believe air travel 2020 prevents type risk. cases increase? sure. aren’t going see massive explosion remotely close saw 1918. Go back sub talk licking dude's jizz. Nah, that's jump cuts for. “School buildings” “schools” different. Schools 1 building. 2,500 includes early childhood centers. I’m minimizing vile crime stated maybe he’s trying atone behaviour 30 years ago 16 year old? don’t give f mark wahlberg, I’m seeing good deed.

The advantage novel status means latent resistance population builds time regardless, rendering yet another endemic virus. 

Instead calm rational, people like act like end world. reality not. feel need remove yourself, feel free. Society better it. someone like net drain, spread harm fear. worry though, notva single tear would shed you. fact bonus quarantine/ lockdowns one would even notice gone. Praise Fauci overlord!

Not sure call someone volunteer volunteered someone else, even parent. need source incorrect claim, care printed, find local library. However, inability back claim source, printed online, really argument favors. Especially since patiently explained mistaken continue pretend leg stand on.

In case, know talking ass. 

Have better day. parents want parent yo them, that’s schools job. others, fanatically crippling. Time get third governor 1 term ... Sweden less densely populated non-nordic countries. talking circles here? 

Most covid deaths cases sweden Stockholm. 

5800 deaths sweden. 2400 deaths Stockholm county - 41% counties covid deaths Stockholm county. 

Sweden's population 10.2 million. Stockholm counties population 2.3 million - 23% country lives Stockholm country. 

A disproportionate amount covid deaths occured Stockholm argument based population density underlying health issues like obesity rate (see post way this). 
 
The demographics matter discussing covid outcomes. underlying demographics different sweden, UK, US. I'm also pretty sure Rand would willing pay everyone stay home slightest symptom pay people stay home kids kid symptoms. That's lesson really wants learn us it? anything like what? seems odd, keep feeling like people forgetting covid. Says guy think carbon emissions care traveling. Last time checked, LESS flights ever. importantly, business trip Russia flight Russia ""no reason"", comes environmental impact. Maybe stop trolling irrelevant message board, bud. like 15 posts topic, none make sense. act like half dozen flights ""nowhere"" day suddenly making impact anything. not. What's funny whining wont anything, pretty comical. people think airlines care buc\_32's inaccurate opinions? LOL

**Note.** I'm really interested response. Save predictable, irrelevant downvote unintellectual response someone cares. post people see post simply factually incorrect. live Paris thing note bars close 10. People move parties friend's houses earlier...I see new ""scarlet zone"" changes impact rising cases Paris.  don’t know got number. It’s almost 1000. Whenever hand washing discovered way prevent childbed fever, huge backlash guy discovered it. worries got sad truth different. ~30% US households ~40% Swedish households single person. Average household size US 2.5 persons Sweden 2.2 persons. IIRC official policy test symptomatic persons (with one test center even getting trouble testing someone show symptoms), could plenty asymptomatic cases remaining. That’s exactly what’s happening. point, look like idiot saying don’t believe COVID someone bear tell relative died it, you’re going get someone know hospitalized... thing is, you’re objectively wrong unless relationships never leave house you’re going find out. *was* incredibly arrogant  pretty widely assumed current limit 50 people public events raised 500 first October. doesn’t seem like happen now. little late, publication  hope school child gave him. record im *not* saying global warming isnt issue, worth noting *a lot* unknowns worries scientists. unknowns arent caused incompetence anything, issue climate incredibly complex ton different factors, basically impossible take every factor consideration making predictions.

This see wide range predictions, *not* ""oh corrupt lying"" like climate change deniers like say cause climate extremly complex. see now, thanks! work education think number nearly 2500 yet that's curious good context give example even general identity privacy rules official statistics Sweden - Socialstyrelsen, publishes death reports people died COVID-19 based death certificates statistics started using ""X"" certain dates, indicates 1-4 people died date disease. still calculate accurate total deaths period, specify many people exactly died certain date chance individuals might identified information. Collin Co Texas... hospitalizations doubled last 2 weeks. 66 That's pretty horrible news. Hopefully European countries offer take ICU patients Spain's resources depleted. sorry standpoint water God fucks can't read, swear. 

We've decline since July cases deaths, STILL 3300 currently hospitalized. Inaccurately? suggest death count inaccurate? Ah ment wanted **link** source. reinfection exists... herd immunity? magical number spread starts reduce everyone currently sick ohh! sound great. Best rename herd immunity herd actively infected... Poetic justice indeed Thoughts prayers, is. app right now, there's updates available. meant Vitamin Oh God, poke hornets nest, you..... case actually turn breakthroughs something used general population would take 10 years testing something like cocid-89 read title teachers armed guns first! Virus virus It’s silly question. wonder, aspect sniffed, identified, could also identifiable mass spectrometer? NHL bubble, NBA bubble, NFL tested daily + social distancing others. 

Its complicated. Except covid mutate anywhere near fast flu seen evidence whatsoever recombinant strains. Alright thank  Armpit believe No, u cant say wouldn’t worked u see works BARDA founded 2006, didn’t “give seed money” 1979 Transgene founded certainly didn’t give cash 1980s non-replicating adenovirus tech invented. great idea one wear America. Chicken thought he’d invited parties year eating either, it’s hard blame restaurants reopened knowing way avoid permanently going business. things:

- Herd Immunity black white threshold nearly zero cases. people around immune, harder becomes virus spread. wild strategy ""refuted"", factual law nature gravity.

- case count quite irrelevant metric data inconsistent, known garbage tell us little. possible compare cases right cases earlier volume testing, profile people tested changed absurdly. sign people infected right ever. Even are, many cases mild even completely unnoticeable without test, information means nothing reality healthcare services. go around trying count every swine flu case possible, many people catch flu every season.

This metric completely abandoned favour objective measures tell us more, positivity rate, hospitalizations proportion cases serious. Sadly, case counts awesomely big numbers perfect press feist make fantastic headlines. hoped point public would learn understand sadly stupidity humans bounds. Ok sent email. Thank I’m sorry going quick memory. recall bad. forgot tree branch oof. wasn’t trying make light all. shit sure. say WAHLBURGERS yes face real justice front judges, process takes time happens away, wash hands afterwards

That makes sense wandering silently around supermarket. yeah, need highlight importance project breath risk exposure. know poor decisions going play out. charge ignore act surprised. capable recognizing people derive enjoyment flying/driving/running?

I drive double distance next Sunday you! extremely risky, there's already active PSA looking people close contact 2 imported cases. infected duo somehow got onto high speed train saying?
-Rand Paul ""A single death tragedy, million deaths statistic."" - Stalin possible professional sportsman positive tests time? 

like maybe 5 - 10 % them? population much less affected? deny hospital care well Poor dogs Marky Mark want kids become Funky Bunch. article states evidence dogs catch it; dogs lack receptors catch spread virus. Mink cats susceptible, however. Thoughts n' prayers!  I'm going start blocking everyone posts bullshit clickbait articles per health authority guidlines, probably thought stay 1.5m away, wash hands afterwards, transmission. Someone needs hammer virus airborne spreads similar cigarette smoke. 😂😂😂  would imagine can't detect covid vs illnesses similar symptoms, good keep sick people airplanes whether covid, flu, common cold. Covid, might lived many years, so, yeah, died Covid. ...and would like keep way. mean, one really cared develop assay tell infection active, would target metabolic related compounds - waste, chemical intermediaries, enzymes, virus. things present viral particles ""alive"". don’t cost much PHRMA likes say cost. well published cancer medicines highly complex trials. Mostly, however I’d anticipate virus constantly undergoing mutations creating effective vaccine becomes difficult. 

Overall great news. Dude, convicted hate crime showed remorse for, need go real monsters, like people made racially insensitive joke online 10 years ago. know charge Rohirrim armies Mordor epic truly experience many people fighting screen something never seen before?

&amp;#x200B;

More people died COVID amount people, horses orcs scene. fools. “The whole fucking world dealing something we've never experienced before”

This key point many forgetting ignoring. People want life “normal” cannot grasp reality world changed forever. I’m obviously saying *this* live forever, something stomp feet, demand end, move past right away. See? defensive this. imo someone racist past look back learn better educate themselves, they’re okay book. ""higher degree inflammation"" mean? Psychotic wanting guy killed thousands people face karmic justice? Ya know it’s bad random people interwebz guessed you’re based that. dogs keep contracting spreading others? can't wait ingest disinfectant shoot UV lights body. realize Sweden starting see uptick new infections, right? They’re near herd immunity. Also, vaccines tend produce robust immune responses without, know, getting fucking disease idea regarding long-term effects are. Even vaccine lacks high efficacy likely produce better result fucktards like believe would best young people got disease. 

I sick shit. head CDC Dr. Fauci believe 20% US population immune. 20% 200,000 people DEAD mentality. “We’ve tried nothing we’re ideas.” 

Next, you’ll say 200,000 count people pre-existing conditions. Wouldn’t mostly still alive Covid? YES, would be. can't. We've seen every College reopening towns around spikes reopening. Rhode Island recent good example. happens dog gets covid though? works like flu shot, protect correct strain virus half time. Better nothing, sure, still ideal. dogs gonna expensive hard train lot Take South Park method fuck death poor skin bones point.

Cuss live basement. “Silly scandals” he’s engaged serious corruption arguably broken countless Canadian ethics laws. Plus Wilson-raybould. happens don’t comply? Sounds good, agree Sweden numbers give insight would worked US. evidence lockdowns US. would motivation besides political survival? sort compelling argument issuing mask mandate, especially ""encouraging"" use science backed? sick hearing Bill Gates. man given platform deserve. influences health astonishing. Stop listening Bill. must least one person know wish dead now, allowed post Reddit. thinks this? Post references.

A minority epidemiologists think going lower 50%, one actually knows, modeling. write known, not.

Here’s recent commentary published recently Nature doesn’t agree you. proven effective. big question, count all. know keep bringing Boris, he's supreme cunt, sadly succumb COVID, instead came back bigger cunt.

and I'm psychotic one People sub going insane, go outside live life care think big deal really impact personally they're young. 

That's really sad statement values folks. Trump's new plan:   
""We trained army dogs deploy every neighborhood testing.  
They sniff butt, tremendously accurate.  accurate test there.  We November election""    could dogs become asymptomatic carriers? Missourian hope gets worst symptoms possible. F*ck Parson. Every country fucked history, going hilarious turns German American taking moral high ground. reluctance say make think country made obvious snafu would undermine argument.

The experts likes CMO, Fauci, teams working current vaccine candidates well virologist epidemiologists.

I know keep bringing Boris, he's supreme cunt, sadly succumb COVID, instead came back bigger cunt. weird keep bringing despised UK.

Only person despised Trump. Ootl. What's happening November? Progress come understand looks narrow set factors. Overall every support system Earth owe existence decline years. 

Coronavirus symptom. Trump symptom. Capitalism, ever-growing consumerism erased non existent progress. Science days highly political easily manipulated

Science factual backing. Where's yours? I’ve never before, don’t think so, neighbor give lung treatment C-Diff inhaler. started using got worried didn’t would mess lungs stopped Rand Paul, listening? Fake cases prominent (as heard people) government provides money hospital patients ( can't confirm heard so) , hospital making false positive money.
I know letting go controlling cases country huge population difficult! 
Mortality rate low data show, that's people careless! incredibly bad math full stupid assumptions. average comorbidity rate 2.6. people died diseased bodies extended periods time. didn’t die covid. died covid. it’s sensationalist language attention grabbing say died covid. Yes. yes. Yes. words, turn tap, water flow out. Ah ""veiled threat dont agree me"".
Sod off, already still follow guidelines. call straw man argument, easy set easy knock everyone die, bodies piled streets, complete collapse healthcare system

I remember serious person claiming things. making words motivations putting mouths imaginary people agenda. disagree points (no mechanism align interests average citizen, fail produce qualified leaders), argument *can* specific conditions.

If think authoritarianism Korea juche system, course worth arguing it. thought dogs plus additional test, would make good belt braces approach. in, even dog says yes no, still get test. 2 agree definite positive, disagree additional testing maybe. results additional disagree &amp; testing also give good estimates actual accuracy dogs tests. Sweden population actually 10 millions.

Denmark 6, Norway 5.5, Finland 5.5

Where fuck get numbers from? age IFR close zero people ages 15 44, increasing **3.1% 65–74-year-olds** 11.6% anyone think little screening airports. Realistically can’t screen us currently.
They promised us sorts protection get us fly really reneged sadly. 
My husband flew back internationally went lockdown I’d sent covid travel pack end February ( travels due work wasn’t due back end March) thought neurotic took placate 😂
But glad N95s alcohol gel coming home mayhem flights countries closing borders.
I’d given N95s charcoal ones vents on. know protect wearer people around you. time could wear them.
If wear KN95 suggest wear cloth mask help fit. think they’re terrible. really bad especially women. cloth mask help fit face whilst flying offer maybe protection? nothing else help keep mask clean🤷‍♀️ 
If flying I’d also wear clear visor mask. time asked remove mask Identity checks also added screen whole flight.
My husband flew 15 hours didn’t remove mask even drink. felt like crap seriously you’re enclosed space like plane you’ve choice it’s safe. problem can't rolled though, way 11/4. Literally even matter who's prez; getting distributed months. Even something given EUA late october, months available wide scale. Like said, MAYBE elderly/infirm/healthcare workers get leading 11/4. Maybe like ""Oh yeah, EUA'd vaccine"" take one brain cell see concocting vaccine home laboratory really put stamp this. People see this. see line events actually materially helps 11/4. really get big point contention people, especially there's prez simps big pharma/FDA places. best interests overall push vaccine that's ready, necessarily best interest people who's jobs finances line.

Huh? best interest approve vaccine that's ready, yes. mean best interest people who's jobs finances line? honest, I'm sure even got RH 7 working. think work that's switched debian.  might want try Carl Sagan’s Demon Haunted World... Lol 1st years able experience 3rd years already three years guess it’s life time. 

Also I’m pretty sure everyone able party again. It’s big deal save lives guy size defeat corona, makes one question really dangerous... thought risk group people cardiovascular, heart lung problems, man big, definitely least 2/3 problems, all. OK thanks bars, clubs restaurants fully open condition masks worn temperature checks

Completely lost there, kids. masks going worn people eating drinking? aren’t. temp checks security theater. “Works great! Well besides drug trafficking charges that’s importance. 10/10 would ballon ass again!” report obviously long get gist abstract.  Nobody believes bodies piled streets point. States largely open economy fucked long term failed contain disease. Stop trying strawman mitigations anything everything complete lockdown. making bad faith argument meant downplay need mitigation. Can't compare Sweden __________!

/$



Too soon compare Sweden _________!


/$ 98% accurate pretty shitty goal. dog always say it'll right 99.999% time.

Different dogs different levels training different accuracy may even vary day day. overeengineered tests complain hell lot reliable 60-70%, always work well.

That say dog &lt;10% false negative rate useful entrance airport shopping center, something rely general point data sick, dying, dead went White House, many people believe current Data actually undercount unknown number black period. misreading end paragraph.

The aircraft carrier observation provided evidence obvious pre-existing immunity SARS-CoV2 provided cross-protection previous infection endemic “common cold” coronavirus (which humans infected multiple times throughout lives). “artificial environment” reasonable way test hypothesis, basically challenge system.

Cauchemez “claiming” expert, one, specifically topic modeling infectious disease. Pump Dump? I’m confused. They’ve always known pandemic way, matter when. 1st year students desperately want party dont need explain why. 3rd year students final year never experience again. went uni sole purpose partying idk tf managed finish highest grade. I'm swede mostly city folk gets corona. loss there. doesn’t really make sense “combined” comparison you’re still going divide per capita... rocket science ! /s - Herman Cuh-cain know turtles never forget. country, we’d #15 world. It’s much rosier picture nothing. Wait predicted upsurge cases. Look happened 1918. report pro covid assholes. debating religion point Redhat 7 backwards step 6.x. topic relevant. deserves discussion.

There sin discussing relevant topics. trying suppress relevant discussion? job. think are? many years university? imagine means research vaccines paused needed focus efforts Covid-19 I'd say younger Generations lock. I'm sick anyone know sick stay hell home. Work pay enough treat well enough go sick. hope doesn’t put dogs danger catching virus Please add BREAKING headline


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ahh yes heart disease 5 7 year old suffering from... say hamburgers fix cause.. nothing else has... would referring Oxford vaccine. non human primate challenge trials, monkeys still got infections, severe pneumonia. Moderna Pfizer vaccines, showed neutralizing immunity non human primates. others, 2 promising. Yeah, I'm disappointed Ok Putinishka concept ""herd immunity"" work unless willing incur whole lot avoidable deaths.

Herd immunity become somewhat negative buzzword subreddit. much appreciate herd immunity measles countries thanks vaccines. think too. wonder effective symptomatic cases there’s huge immune/cytokine response. showed ill-effects coronavirus weekend, scoring goals Milan beat Bologna first game new Serie announcement came one day team mate Leo Duarte returned positive test, however Milan said rest squad, also tested, negative. Ok, so, till now, government blamed bars, shops, kids, students, working people able wear masks day office, sports fans remember else, selves issue orders kept everything running?

This becoming increasingly ridiculous. criteria used Germany, officiall numbers 'recovered', mostly estimates. get ill, get tested still alive three weeks later, recovered. 
Which obviously problem people die 6 weeks hospital, number indication (some areas actually go testing making sure, obviously possible hard hit area) mean, want start emulating Sweden's health care strategies, I'd fine it. Ya still means lockdowns helping. citizens following lockdown there's repercussions it, point it? exactly relevant here? Sweden herd immunity strategy jesus, there's nuance here. either virus kills literally everyone infects, total hoax. 

this sub fucking sucks parts parts got hit hardest past, suggests extent kept NY overall, containment measures rather sort ""herd immunity"" Take home. make essential frontline workers. 'kids assholes' narrative horseshit. Less written better. antivaxxers political games, pressure high. risk injury death cultists disapprove vaccine Trump names political enemies, example. Texas also 3x population New Jersey. Deaths per capita much meaningful, measure Texas #18. Concentration camps, names, would sterilize people forcefully wills.... vaccine works otherwise it’s timing made executive orders things didn’t go way? Oh come on... get real... last word... stay blind logic... think people realized death rate low people stopped giving fuck. That’s what’s annoying... could handle covid itself. combine covid shit like flu, diseases, things hospitals get used for, it’s much know want AI reprogram itself. herd immunity mean ""transmission take big steps limit transmission.""

Do consider place automatically ""herd immunity"" people virus due complete, incredibly strict lockdown? that's basically suggesting, that's really term means. democratic authoritarian systems work *specific* conditions 

Authoritarian systems ""work"" sense producing sustainable nation-states. complaint US so-called democracy align interests average citizen, curious one would defend authoritarianism, mechanism align government interests average citizen. 

Worth noting complaint democracy sometimes fails produce qualified leaders, authoritarian systems! Eventually fool inherit crown, military install genocidal maniac, Electoral College pick turds like Trump Bush competent statesmen. means able eat months forced home yes. happening Opened early without support citizens. wholly support new branch dog-based health care. 

For placebo effect purposes, also request 50% dogs receive training whatsoever simply roam around hospitals cuddling people. science. free so. Demanding others follow ridiculous. read article yes, number 100% order get infected via breathing, even 99.9% capture rate insufficient since .01% would enough get infected. lets imagine area particles flying it. long would imagine could stay order infected? personally believe long... clear cut date likely end this: April 2020, CDC director expects widespread vaccine

I always thought would end March, wait extra month. 

I want see Fauci says matter. Whatever says probably best set stone, minus month two gives safe estimates. Yeah whatever that, im saying behind information sports. getting pissy this? corrected you. peole even ok NYC open schools, never reopen. NYC virus stats likely stats every part country years come.

So far seems like virus need yearly vaccine like flu shot effective rate aiming 50% effective rate, together better treatment average deaths like seasonal flu starting next year. still millions covid cases many years come. Kids already lower death rate seasonal flu virus cases detected, spike daily average. That's reason many people shut down, pro shut crowd never happy anyway wanna stay home matter what. Young people responsible policy. bars open, surprise go. bullshit job forced exposed people day, I'd probably also say fuck it, entertainment too. LMAO hurt feelings, little buddy? “School buildings” seems like awkward wording justify statistic [Rats also good detecting Lots untapped researched uses sorts animals. Fuck. It'll make harder get vaccine. Also r/ihadastroke mate. Yep blame Trump, fix things, USA dictatorship president power everything blame something goes wrong falls him. Yep, stay boneheaded logic. real-world infection data confounding factors like limits gatherings mask use. know vaccine development normally takes long? degree funding eagerness volunteers participate seeing now. takes long time enroll people average clinical trial. know phase 3 trials typically take long? need prove efficacy that, need people get infected. trying prove efficacy HPV vaccine, may take long time volunteers exposed HPV get statistically significant difference placebo group vaccinated group. problem COVID - virus running rampant. understand intuition play out, suggested last post, sub full scientists doctors influenced politics sharing opinions insights regarding vaccines, possible treatments, etc. think valuable video game takes place virtual world. 6th point, countries currently require certain vaccinations enter show travel vaccination card customs. surprised becomes thing 2021 COVID vaccines. calling irresponsible names, point 1st point sounds dangerously similar people say ""you whatever want, freedom wear mask"". need work together get mess one side saying wear mask side saying get vaccine admin., US going many dark days ahead. personally, going trust science rather trusting media publishing anti-vaccine stories. Astrazeneca, Pfizer, J&amp;J vaccines developed collaboration European scientists I'm sure skin game comes US politics. European advisory bodies going looking vaccines time FDA well. Probably smells like cat stronger sits next anyone, airport pandemic. getting airplane, well now. good boy could sit outside gate 100% correct. virus politicized. Many people still think hoax language used early on. People need understand ""doctor"" mean all-knowing expertise epidemiology really anything outside narrow field. family member ob/gyn, people ask coronavirus he's basically like ""I fucking know, listen epidemiologists."" medical brain entirely occupied things needs know job. There's room advanced knowledge epidemiology. cares recommendations pregnant women surrounding covid hospital policy patient tests positive. allowed board? University lifetime experience, yes hard like party friends partying, everyone gets FOMO like socialising ""2 weeks flatten curve"" probably end killing 100,000 people.

Honesty important. freaking serious? Oh yeah, narcissist gets re-elected I'll stay room life starve death. I'm even gonna say ""until next 4 terms up"" whole damn country might well bottom ocean then. Around half 65 year olds comorbidities. half people aged 65 would died year anyhow. one ever lived past 70. still chance getting Covid. Fine me. said logical policies. Flu deaths always estimates. swedens 392 deaths per million Nordic countries combined 264 deaths per million. Great fucking job sweden. killin 'em there. risking doggies lives . doggie lives matter still like party pandemic lol it’s hard ceracnting? trying grammar police, maybe word know? actually put surgical mask awesome mask, shut up. r/UnexpectedSchrodingersDog Lmao, another genius talks grade. Saudi arabia handled better anyone. America fucked Saudis closed international travel Makkah March 1st. xenophobes already lost rights since 2001 Trump really cleaning now. Constitution, lol. vaccines require two shots, means useful 50 million people. they're going get allocated towards vulnerable, like front line workers.

Johnson &amp; Johnson unique position recruited 60,000 participants, means present robust data around time Pfizer. J&amp;J hoping emergency authorization beginning early 2021, like January, point begin cranking hundreds millions dosages a) they're manufacturing behemoth, b) single shot along complicated storage requirements game changer kind miracle. absolutely useful Americans, especially rural areas access issues. yes, course, goal also crank dosages developing countries well.

Don't get wrong - getting many candidates approved possible great. Moderna, Pfizer, Astrazeneca...we'll need many get. J&amp;J working advanced product essentially means 'end' pandemic like 6 months sooner expected. Thus saving millions people death, unemployment, homelessness, etc. [Guess Ryder, we're going *Uzbekistan* vacation sure. US pay highest price them, get them. That's richest country. think may happened Spain Italy, bodies getting picked right away many mortuary workers overworked. think piled streets, left home day two.

Why would anybody say healthcare system would go ""complete collapse""? sound realistic all. Overworked maybe, resources stretched, would make collapse? make sense disease collapse health care system. seen numbers people
Currently dying Sweden covid? someone explain downvoted? mean, I'm pretty sure know why, I'd like hear one you. I'm one person, wiped groceries, primarily lot items low touch tons people touching them. believe Fauci others asked said also it. say it, Fauci even it...I wonder point really is. Like others said, think mostly hygiene theater.

I'm making claims here, just...offering practice heard weeks ago others.

I always wash hands bringing stuff in, though. Death rate suggests decline cases result shitty testing rather decline disease.

Not necessarily. see heatmaps age range Florida cases initial spike cases restrictions first lifted incredibly getting even young spike (far right graph), probably schools opening back up. EcoHealth Defiance pay say THAT?? 

Never heard them. facts. think it’s time K-12 school closures end in-person learning resume. major outbreaks ever traced K-12 school, ones opened aren’t experiencing major issues, cons remote learning outweigh pros point. Keep colleges remote, open schools.

I think it’s pretty much proven political issue anyway. Philly Los Angeles talking reopening schools election. It’s insanity damage childhood development election. we’re dojng aged based restrictions now? Shouldn’t start vulnerable populations instead 18-22 year olds? 

Lmao bodies piled streets always sarcasm intentional hyperbole. Maybe skeptics autistic thought everyone serious?🤷‍♂️ ""helps fight"" sub: HAHAHHAHAHA THATLL TEACH HIM!!!!

Reality: doesn’t symptoms wife sniffles. mean I’m sure could happen...but idea control wrong ignorant. UK well even say true

There if. said fact. point ... ?

I'm guy responded to, point would got kids forced go back school, work front line jobs pay pittance, asking completely ignore biology go human nature time wanting socialize?

""Yes, young one, go work grocery stores pandemic, DARE go see friends, even though us older adults said bars allowed open free so.""

Is really shocking go this? want someone integrity ability listen reason.

so, nobody. first thought saw headline Russian Commander saying, “where God damn sniffer dogs!” Party officials give fuck donors either. sizeable portion Americans alright people dying. Handler: Sir, boop tester’s snoot.

Me: :( Yeah wants live world people scared affection dogs? cases declining mobility increases restrictions relaxed.

I know Fauci chosen ignore multitude studies lower HIT values cross-reactive immunity, Houston, like Texas...and Florida...and Arizona...and New York, hit HIT epidemic spread longer possible.

It would seem anybody supported lockdowns owes everybody else apology. Well that’s relevant.

You’re going real bad time premise want start looking basic science technology developed. 


The company got 30-70 million Ebola virus. Plain simple. 3 scenarios predict, 2 (maybe 3) models predict another peak. depends ""off guard"" means USA usa 1st n 2nd world country... sad spot live. would leave quickly lived there. Challenge trial. hoping we'd one back early Summer. 

If someone sincerely understands risk wishes contribute humanity finding solution, permit potential self-sacrifice. wars, this?

This answer safety concerns, answer effectiveness there's enough spread volunteers. Also source month old also, small sample size. EcoHealth Alliance pay say that? curiosity, exactly cadaver dog? look dead bodies? train them? This!!! pandemic gone largely even case increases bit come back worries, never see real surge like March. can't that.

Already got it. severe shortage year, asap. Yes, Obama fiscally conservative. 

He cut deficit half. deficit record last 40 years:

Reagan took deficit $70 billion $175 billion. (8 years)

Bush 41 took $300 billion. (4 years)

Clinton got zero. (8 years)

Bush 43 took zero $1.2 trillion. (8 years)

Obama halved $600 billion. (8 years)

Trump’s got $3.3 trillion (under 4 years) back $ trillion PRIOR pandemic 3 years president. 

Specifically, Obama:

Obama left presidency deficit approximately $584.6 billion, halving $1.41 trillion deficit inherited Bush. ""But every mutation roll dice, transmission widespread United States – continues see tens thousands new, confirmed infections daily – virus abundant opportunities change, potentially troublesome consequences, said study author James Musser Houston Methodist Hospital."" 60 years counting... Soon economy everywhere fully reopen vaccine basically states see stats like NYC every year, people vulnerable still quite vulnerable vaccine's efficiency projected like yearly flu shot, vaccine likely needed every year well. Schools never reopen NYC stat still fine shut crowd.  Yes understand spread love stuff! also use bees detect land mines WW2 funnier claimed pictures interment camp turned brazillian sweatshop.  Angela Merkle 

but yes, general, scientists weird bunch lack governing skills, least, governing skills incident scientific skills, due them. happens tickets? fucked plane ticket go home?

Im planning travel Christmas. Obviously covid still thing also want pay £1000 ticket rendered useless happen contract travelling. decided train dog therapy dog whim, even really know about, thought sounded cool. little guy strong bond us now, amazing. He's obedient- he's teammate. He's always checking walking like reading mind times. He's also extremely good little kids dogs too. Highly recommend it. forced work shitty frontline jobs, go college, asked entertainment LUL. definitely vague memory first two.

Of course it’s gospel choir, I’m thinking writing paper religion coronavirus spread. Even Maine wedding related religion. tested positive feels fine. wife tested positive congestion. Terrifying.

If COVID-19 airborne (and per multiple scientific sources), masks even meaningless source control droplet transmission.

Time move on. initial test mean, least country supposed stay away healthcare unless situation desperate. rich people would hire teams programmers slant AI favor. back bars really high risk events would lying said started hanging friends outdoors picnics beer shares month. That's false. could sampling issue early course disease. Ah explains it. airport test way airport would able prevent boarding. However ministries could made everyone pending tests results put no-fly list temporarily. understands, starred Happening. Stop eating pigs!

It's like mother nature fed humans. Get it. got flu healthy 33 year old messed BAD. Definitely worth small percentage might keep getting it, lessening effects come it. Every one came signed note: ""Say Hi mother me""

Pharma work done governments. that's troll buddies posts free karma subs. Maybe wack ass people said shit like start. see kind language used here. 

I saw reports Intensive Care units hospitals overflowing, people treated hallways nurses make triage decisions. different ""complete collapse healthcare system."".

I saw refrigerated trucks used temporary morgues, see reports bodies piled streets.

I seen reports death rate 1-2%. seen reports ""everyone die"" met anybody believes said it. saying Obama fiscally conservative? 

And stated prior, I'm aware sometimes neither candidate fiscally conservative. another one times. expect neither candidate actually reduce spending kind expect either candidate create kind program whatsoever average americans. view Biden's promises empty lip service.

I favor neither category. US, mentality right try stay away people wear mask vaccine. 

No point anything unless every state something time.

I think testing 30 cycle thresholds. devote resources vulnerable letting young/healthy people live lives. There's causal link antibiotics greater severity. nothing worry about. Oh makes much sense.

*Trump runs concentration camps

You come saying ""it can't concentration camps UN intervening"".

* Trump sanctioned ICC UN org that's supposed intervene.

You: ""HOW International Tribunal shall power prosecute persons responsible following crimes committed armed conflict, whether international internal character, directed civilian murder;(b) extermination;(c) enslavement;(d) deportation;(e) imprisonment;(f) torture;(g) rape;(h) persecutions political, racial religious grounds;(i) inhumane acts.""

Trump's camps fit a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i!

You: ""But never able compare trump's crimes humanity worse Syria's!!!!!!""

It's obvious arguing good faith lol Close 100% better odds many forms testing. Honestly, one ever said that. said children spread rate adults, suffer rate adults. said would significantly increase hospitalizations deaths.

If someone promised , ask money back. like cultural differences role im sure. poor compliance masks west now, peak pandemic think turn widespread adoption.

Reddit main subs nutshell Alternate headline: 90% New York schools yet report single positive case despite high levels testing. ate onion Vaccine + new therapies + improved hospital protocols + occasional mask wearing = back normal mid 2021. People put lives much longer, matter reddit hivemind thinks. Social distancing going thing vaccine comes out, sorry.  Taking realistic approach best way analyze event one.

Criminals violating international standards human ICC represents constitutes part global system international justice United States chief architect Nuremberg beyond. Today, ICC, alongside tribunals, regional mechanisms, national courts, carrying forward efforts investigations prosecutions could help realize justice atrocity victims Sudan Myanmar. court last resort, ICC intervene State demonstrated unwillingness inability hold nationals account crimes within Court’s jurisdiction. ICC therefore provides essential backstop victims recourse justice. use sanctions potential wide-reaching impact institution dedicated advancing justice victims.

Convenient Trump, running concentration camps, sanctioning International watchdog body, eh? Hitler-esque

To summarize:

1. Trump runs concentration camps

You come saying ""it can't concentration camps UN intervening"".

2. Trump sanctioned ICC UN org that's supposed intervene.

You: ""HOW RELEVANT!!!!!!!!""

It's obvious arguing good faith lol diapers malls open? fuck?  read whole article find close 100 percent. Couldn’t find it. students teachers become sick coronavirus since schools began opening last month, public health experts found little evidence virus spreading inside buildings, rates infection far found surrounding early evidence, experts say, suggests opening schools may risky many feared could guide administrators chart rest already unprecedented school year.



There is. entire article. free anyway Finland, tested twice. Yeah. Viruses. know... things exist nature never infected anyone libs wanted hut Trump. Oh yeh that’s true save K9 good bois :(  ok, conditions make difference according you. Got it. I'm trying understand logic, nothing else. really needs happen everywhere it’s possible. Otherwise places close it’s consistent. People’s tolerance understanding restrictions hinge it.

Allowing zero 50 people football stadium 100000 people mall next door stadium isn’t consistent.

If it’s necessary keep stadiums closed that’s fine - I’d like see restrictions number people malls IKEAs too. use live human beings right clinic? delay reported testing reported death UK seems lower elsewhere - possibly around 3 weeks. Using delay, CFR remained pretty steady around 1-2%. indicates significant undertesting still (the way cases growing also indicates this). 1-2% CFR today's 7-day running average 4500 cases would 45-90 daily deaths three Preventative measures thing full lockdown. Straw man harder disingenuous suggest could least 7,000 additional deaths - worst case scenario number could high 35,000.

No they're expecting 7,000 outside possibility 35. Reading comprehension taught school? couple weeks. buy shit either. Fool once... says right article. They’re developing vaccine it. Flu vaccines easy. Everything go absolutely swimmingly! Thanksgiving awesome! Extra hugs grandma immuno suppressed uncle ted!

Many women acknowledge men experience pain, physical emotional, exactly women do. Testosterone suppresses tears raises threshold reflexive response crying, man experiencing equal pain woman may crying woman would be, people need acknowledge man crying mean everything OK. Right-wing conspiracy theory nonsense. Young people also dominate front line jobs, exposed daily masses.

Herd immunity happen without good vaccine. mention horrible social-darwinist approach would lead huge numbers deaths. grandfather farm animal got sick contagious disease he'd never ignore go things like normal say ""Well eventually they'll immune. Even dead ones.""Not acceptable cattle far less human beings. - I'm directing personally venting frustration politicians promote nonsense.

We wish deal pandemic. really best time history endure lockdowns technology available continue working, entertain keep touch friends family. 

I find video calls zoom groups good way safely relax friends like used go dinner drinks example. makes easier thought maybe could helpful people well. Unfortunately, certain turtle cancer. Todd Akin's infamous comment 2012, think majority redditors young remember this? melodramatic Even Swedes handling Sweden well... tested positive last month, followed symptoms almost exactly, though mostly milder, couple days. rather interesting see. timeline dude. either get back living don’t. Maybe we’ll vaccinated 2022 doubt it. Get life Yes rich consume think overestimate much. majority spending things VAT. wealthy also often straight hire employees goes around VAT entirely. Youre flat lying. says, “The Ct value could high result early disease.” High counts occur people become contagious. need high sensitivity catch presymptomatic asymptomatic spreaders absence alternative advancement technology. increase cases still small compared rest Europe. Average daily cases Sweden doubled (2x) since low point month. 

In Finland Denmark, cases increased 30x. Norway, 15x. Germany, 5x. France, Spain, Italy, around 20-30x. 

The Swedish approach proving *sustainable* always goal - instituting set guidelines people reasonably comply years necessary. strategy never herd immunity, existence substantial population immunity probably help blunt second wave hitting rest continent much harder.  Unless Michigan State University enough political savvy get people think he’s hero orders led deaths thousands nursing home patients - he’s probably good. I'm dem mistake point. fda strengthened emergency authorization requirements.

If Donald overrules fda forces approval right election, I'd absolutely move like this. right feels like it'll undermine confidence vaccine. like World War Z! apocalypse coming full circle!! /s Cutting deficit half meaningless gesture opinion. I'm struggling think good metaphor going fixed. like going way much debt better going way way much debt. recognize difference, difference moot.

Maybe Obama least cut debt GDP ratio could overlooked bit, didn't. Also know entire deficit reduction Obama function Fed's QE program reduced interest rates government debt significantly, thereby single handedly reducing deficit well 600B. Fed's QE program, deficit would gone up. seems hard credit Obama Fed's monetary policies. makes worse put us position take decades recover. Fed never end QE program entirety decades. Maybe 2050 soonest start working right now. Instead continue alter last 12 years so. can't removed entirety rely lower rate. Removal programs would put us dangerous place inflation. simply much baked risk now.

And again, recognize Trump's spending massive problem, opinion Biden going nothing different. see difference two spending. spending factor decision. wish could have. live Copenhagen worry. didn’t worry cases started rising mainly young people hospitalizations it’s bit worrying. Because... short term. Pretty crazy think people wikl avoid interacting people long term. Also due threat fines governments preventing businesses opening.

Now, let's put 100% patrons high outbreak areas see happens. 

Again, argument make sense - NH fully reopened either that's likely one reason numbers remain low. actually testing time

Yes, also no. *are* testing Boris said couple days ago enough testing capacity/staff/chemicals way lower needs time. That’s pretty healthy ratio. 

I guess agree every single student teacher every single school tested, would probably least one case found schools. That’s likely going case years though, certainly entire 2020-21 school year, that’s unacceptable means schools won’t open. 

My mom teacher, she’s 65 classroom almost month. one getting tested, things fine. plans place happens people get sick. take Dr. Tegnell word plan wasn’t intentionally develop herd immunity

Yeah... too... like telling us far away herd immunity was, claimed shocked low positive rate first mass testing antibodies done.

But importantly... never take anyone ""word"", actions always truthful. Tegnell proved ""herd immunity"" strategy actively chose try stop spread virus. spent weeks counting numbers trying figure far away herd immunity would be... truth slapped face saw still long way away death toll still mounting. It’s literally insane anyone could look bad news.

Some things bad: since covid quit smoking, become better cook, even got know owners local businesses better barely drive outside county anymore.

Its going easy, simple things help:

Wear ppe. Social distance. Refrain unneeded excursions (shelter place). keep things maybe, maybe, reduce strain medical community, get working therapeutics possible vaccine faster.. FDA traditionally strictest approval requirements world. Idk looking towards EU Canada would help case Stop making guesses trying appear smarter are. Good luck you. riots protests though im sure Okay. Whatever. say seem think said I'm going continue useless argument. I’m wishing death either, sure ain’t praying lives either. is. Totally agree!

Honest question. live really wear PPE??? live Massachusetts seen single person walking around PPE acting like everybody mother wearing PPE. Always skeptical articles like appear link sources. 

Finland low expected positive rate, stood airport declared every person covid negative also would likely 99% accurate.

What need calling programs like success research specificity sensitivity dogs real world conditions. Pffft. Halfway..? like halfass... Aye. Shame ol Vallance though. Let's hope conflict interest. would political. open article linked. explains cases lower Sweden herd immunity. 

Some reasons include:

1) baning nursing home visits since March

2) schools universities summer

3) people leaving cities vacation summer homes isolated areas. 

4) 98% population changed behavior voluntarily protect covid

5) 87% increasing social distancing measures May. 

6) baning large gatherings


""There often quite misconception done done sweden"" said Christian Althaus, epidemiologist University Bern. 

And address second bullet point - infection rates higher originally expected found antibody testing. Antibody testing tell someone asymptomatic covid otherwise would self-report otherwise tested. Antibody testing still significantly lower 67%

The case number going explained herd immunity. Cases significantly NY, mean lockdown worked? Cases lower US overall several weeks ago - think that's attributed herd immunity?

Also, quick clarification - ""lockdown"" binary option. states US stringent criteria less constitutes lockdown. Sweden took measures prevent spread too. Given lag time contagion death, supporters die they've voted. Genius, evil genius. Scientists literally saying virus acts similar coronaviruses cause colds R0 increase significantly cool dry climates. 

The spike saw south due congregating indoors AC cooling things aiding spread. 

The upcoming seasonal spike much worse. Especially areas hit hard yet. NE may experience mild wave. see. I've hugging kissing people throughout year, stop. keep using elastic start become loose. check following """"N95 mask fit test"" video Youtube. lose electrostatic charge within hours, rendering slightly less protective, unless doctor intubation, would make difference enough matter. Oof I'm actually wrong here. 4 straight days increase hospitalizations, hopefully changes Misery loves company doesn’t apply whatsoever. cute snappy comeback, misapplied it. Fair enough, although total hospitalizations still good metric - even right people called Covid that's they're there, overall numbers go know spike. Sure!

California nearly half death rate (388) Florida (634) well beneath Texas (534) national average (624).

New York second highest country. also urban epicenter US one densely populated regions entire country due international hub trade, business travel hit hardest onset pandemic US Federal government played virus (his words, tape) failed prepare nation combat spread virus.

The US began opening lock around June 6th.

On day New York 30,997 deaths corona virus.

As September 23rd, 33,188 deaths .9% positivity rate testing.

To clear, that's less 1%.

Since New York started safely open 7% increase deaths.

California 4,624 deaths June 6th. Now, 15,195.

They currently 2.8% positivity rate.

Cali seen 228% increase deaths.

Florida. June 6th: 2,691 deaths. Now: 13,623.

Positive tests: 11.2%.

Oh shit. miss spoke. Florida seen 406% increase deaths last four months witnessing virus states like New York.

Onto Texas!

On June 6th, Texas 2,072 dead COVID. Now, 15,491.

Positivity rate: 10.2%.

Holy shit. guess everything bigger Texas.

647% increase.

Which states locked meaningful period time? states mandatory mask orders? states still limiting indoor gatherings?

I think know answer. chew facts digest them.

Then make conscious decision respond comment end humiliation.  NH something called common sense even highly infected neighbor Massachusetts. highest infected counties Massachusetts borders NH people Massachusetts going NH time rest state lockdown.

I shopping like regular day NH coworkers zoom meeting complaining locked inside house. Read article:

""Thousands students teachers become sick the coronavirus since schools began opening last month, public health experts found little evidence virus spreading inside buildings, rates infection far found surrounding communities.""

This data consistently showing, children inefficient spreaders virus. Children acquiring virus community large, adults, detected amongst students, schools become breeding grounds ""super spreader"" events people feared. fucking shit viruses work. conversation hand?

Weird. educated society understands necessary measures, behaves sensibly, run pied pipers.

Gotta get rid social media even remotely possible. heard show earlier dogs catching people days would test positive PCR test. think they'd catch asymptomatic people fine.

Edit: typo 75,000 teachers NYC. they've tested 26%. mean, dogs detect seizures and/or strange illnesses we're still sure clues it. surprised able detect virus specifically (probably along close relatives) Paging Rand Paul's neighbor. person that’s still strict quarantine? husband working home since March , toddler played single child, don’t go stores, pick up. anyone else strict? family trying make feel insane feel like they’re taking enough precautions. Spreading disinformation worse curse words. Incorrect. know usa wont implement sady. :'( \*cries\* Hospitalizations dramatically under-represent number actual cases, though. biggest problem testing inaccurate, there's simply enough it. Yeah, many asymptomatic infections spread children parents greater family. even really possible? Airborne, safe distance room. awful
We lockdown schools closed- loads classes sent home due cases “I’m 23, officer”

“Show ID!”

“I didn’t bring ID, playing disc golf park. walked here.”

“Hands see them!”

You know story. suspect common election Well , depends deaths increased, decreasing staying same. doubt they've getting low Florida. New Jersey, example, time reporting 100 deaths day old deaths, last couple weeks zero handful deaths per day. sometimes deaths may low, number deaths reflect that. whether high, low, medium - reflect current state deaths. I’ve gotten used mouth guards now. :P Even fallen. 

covidtoday.in point keeping friends alive.. literally never see them?

TLDR: friends might well dead can’t see them. believe man change someone honestly regret younger. 

I also believe locked escaped consequences later became famous.

I find half New York households (53%) use individual window/wall air conditioning units, 20% central system.

This compared \~40% central air usage Mid-atlantic region, \~60% US (2009 figures). addition, NYS, going line mid-atlantic - NYC different makeup would imagine much higher window unit percentage. addition, households central air going smaller households without there's skew well respect sheer quantity compare regions (which urban rural) see vast North East, 76% Midwest, 85% South, 74% mostly 75 percent buildings throughout five boroughs constructed 1960, according NYC Department Buildings. Central air became mainstream later 1960s, according U.S. Department Energy. Retrofitting old building central air expensive complicated, New York buildings don’t go trouble making renovation.  York City’s buildings historic, many prewar, don’t space air pass walls,” said Adam Dahill, owner Dahill &amp; Bunce, boutique design development company. “Installing central air conditioning one biggest dilemmas face restoration.”  majority locations use window wall AC units don’t use 12 months year, use peak hours summertime,” said Dickerson. “So marketplace hasn’t placed pressure innovation window wall-based AC units.”  thing’s sure: New York’s summer cityscape continue dotted window air conditioners years say speculation risk air conditioning systems. said speculation would attribute entirety city's COVID numbers based tertiary mode transmission without considering context balancing studies versus probabilistic causes practicality.

Edit: even noticed introduced heating (it's 90 degrees months comon now). Again, pivoting pivoting retroactively try prove theory. Look numbers FIRST, propose something try find evidence later. information, heating NYC mostly steam gas. I'm sure insistent characterizing NYC obviously know anything it. solutions, like sacrifices, like anything. look capacity regular ICU 16 patients far small scale... seeing drop testing increase TPR. Plus data reporting systems shit national statewise totals dont reconcile theres something shady too, throwing whole stats balance. large safety gain talking 1.1 million kids. aren’t day care. year basically loss learning anyway. Oh? must missed it. please point examples people sub hysterical spreading fear porn referring bodies piled streets? they're raised around violent blacks / asains racism grows there. educated society understands necessary measures, behaves sensibly, run pied pipers.

Well there’s problem. 70% US falls outside this. think still 50k+ new cases everyday? 😂 literally call contagious strain dominating new infections.

Agree, news. deficit half meaningless gesture opinion

Seriously? means next president Obama did, we'd balanced budget. Meanwhile, Trump utterly blown budget way never seen. 

I mean, think reason continue discussion. thought - want vote certain way emotional reasons, try reverse-engineer thin justifications get there. great perspective. Regarding Sweden, get back November I'll tell plan success not. Anyone crowing success right celebrating extremely prematurely. Yup, keyword ""usually."" Far many take far long. US coronavirus response shitshow. Like recruiters calling job requires high school diploma even though 10 years experience highly technical field? Nah, UAE Sinopharm's two inactivated virus vaccine, SinoVac. Sinopharm thinks vaccine would available even earlier around end November start December, current UAE phase 3 trial successful. underestimating role personal responsibility too. People China, East Asian country matter, problem wearing masks. way start pandemic. also complied lockdown orders way better did.

Here America, armed protests superspreading social events like backyard parties, in-person weddings, concerts, motorcycle shows every week. We're beyond spoiled selfish here, wonder beat thing. sure, reduce ""aUtHoRiTaRiAn GoVeRnMeNt."" like government completely incompetent jack sh*t entire pandemic. time ever got mandatory temperature check going Chinese supermarket. TFW random Chinese supermarket better job handling pandemic federal government. difference political systems, difference competence mobilization. Ah. COVID deniers often ask innocent questions like this. sub may batshit crazy one way depending time zone. What? went hospital recently nurse almost screaming fever? Fever? aiming thermometer head too😂 
It like comedy show. It’s show taking temperatures definitely listen poster below, I've basically thing also working full time grocery store. also live 70 year old woman health problems, although tough times I'm fine long takes keep people close me, including team work makes possible food naysayers' tables, safe.

Seeing ex-wife almost die viral disease become different person chronic health issues following infection (she perfectly healthy marathon runner before) something want re-live I'm seeing similar stuff co-workers/friends infected coronavirus chronic fatigue, restlessness/insomnia, etc. naysayers ""dont give fucks"" people can't understand like someone asks, ""what like got sick?""

Don't let abstract become real never abstract again. Depends area. eat 7 days week restaurants around well. Nobody allowed Finland basically. It’s same. New York million public school students. It’s known observed smaller districts students get sick spread virus others outside school. ok NYC infection rate low. 

I’m worried soon hit 3% close. Like said I’m giving Thanksgiving may take long.

My view opening waste time won’t last. effort put helping online programs. already examples comments refuting claims. Let say wants say long screw Elder Scrolls Fallout. Exactly. There's reason Oxford trials continued everywhere ***but*** US. It’s college town, targeting CU Students. Right, true. FDA great job designed do-- that. Luckily they're starting come around types tests getting approved. Good write local, state, *and* federal representatives issue. thought god would protect them... 🤣 mean conservatives sort fucked US voting trump so...  Bad bot need permanent pandemic response department. 

That WHO. cannot force countries act. China informed early January. Countries like Korea took seriously, countries like US not. need shut airports country experiencing pandemic. controlled flights quarantined travelers.

This problematic lot flights foreigners leaving country. Take Wuhan example. Chinese citizens need visa go Europe America, suggesting people flying Wuhan Chinese citizens, since cannot get visa instantly. would work country forbid citizens countries leaving hotspot? holding hostage? Internally made PPE necessity.

This requires people knowing kinds PPE necessary. early days, insufficient testing knowledge, kinds PPE people have? people wearing gloves day instead masks? what? slow spread

Ahhhh.... nostalgia. Texas confirmed 17,000 new cases Tuesday. New York's highest day new cases 11,000 April 15. Texas significantly bigger population New York, current numbers coming Texas good. believe Vietnamese pupils, see eyelid. swedens approach didnt work like charm like anti lockdowners claimed.  way smell food.

I'm sure there's higher concentration one two volatile organic compounds specific COVID like diseases recognize. People get keeping schools closed automatically make anything safer. Sure, minority kids stay home, stay-at-home parents, afford nanny. Many, many kids go childcare centers (mine one them, today speak). Therefore, safety gain. Potentially, risk increase, establishments closely regulated DOE schools are. get high horse ""lives come first"". Plus loss learning, plus financial hardship. Plus kids lose essential services receive schools. Slogans easy, reality complicated. dogs gets covid?? :((( 8 months?! Dude that’s point.

As far masks, idk that's area expertise know anyone around age (22) worries dying virus. infectious diseases yourself, they're infect. Well that’s fucking great! Considering badly it’s handled far, really truly fucked! son said high school principal proudly announced recently school zero cases.

""There indications Swedes gained element immunity disease, which, together everything else prevent infection spreading, enough keep disease down,"" Kim Sneppen, professor biocomplexity Niels Bohr Institute Copenhagen, told Politiken newspaper. looking Arizona www.91-DIVOC.com data, new cases deaths simultaneously doubled past two weeks. looks like artifact data collection, since deaths usually trail new cases two weeks more. vaccines don’t make something deadly. Example: flu.

correct, vaccine that's 100% efficacious masky mask funky bouche Well case seems issue, updated article note:  Texas added backlog cases Sept. 22, removing 7-day average Texas' cases increased 28.3%; Map: Andrew Witherspoon, 

It certainly 76% increase.  stay 6 feet away blackout consider disinfecting toilet sick head kegstands, remember wipe mouthpiece drug store offer covid-19 testing, consider getting one waiting plan B filled.

interacting face-to-face what? Humans continue ""interact"", since one central tenets human society. I'll even wager people keep living nothing changed. 

Will everyone go back way things were? think so, m8. That's in! shoot head get cancer!

Take that, Cancer ! much western world could get vaccine mid-2021. issue getting vaccine third world another thing entirely.

Never again. think us thread side, sexism bad men also suffer effects seismic. However, think may fully understand stereotyping actually works recognizing stereotype interpersonal interactions different citing well-proven statistical trend shows men demographic enculturated behave certain way.

Yeah, let's keep travel bit. want deal one. complicated though it? Wear masks stay away people. Lol. Well, I'm surprised all... I've paying attention. listen media, think veritable *plague* happening amongst college kids HS students... Problem ppl keep forgetting...this basted virus enter eyes. Tell governments happy accept cargo comes helping seafarers that's draw line. We're dumb lot. Yes we're smart we're graded curve vs animals. think we're smartest beings galaxy... well... since embraced science, think look hard see care ghosts vs actual living beings.  Ah, that’s UK, Spain, European countries spiking again. Get high horse, isn’t going away country, likely rest lives, either live it, let society crumble around us. argument lockdowns dont work NY highest death rate childish lie could imagine someone like him. clearly data see happened beginning virus spreading anyone knew US. Since lockdown, case death rates plummeted. Antibodies far sign immunity 

As article danish: google Name translated fact NY feels needed (and I’m making judgements) bad indication politicized become. American, embarrassed. Facts.

The way go things lies somewhere middle. People averse leaving house socialising everybody economy would fucked peoples mental health would fucked. virus care age. need bodies. 

calling misbehaving sounds infantile actually bio-terroism. “So hungry money...” mom’s school completely non-profit, teachers/employees paid substantially less would public school. They’re open it’s right thing students they’re afraid. goodness 😂 sure that--I can't speak Colorado, vast majority places, age discrimination statutes protect people discriminated old, young. young person protected class way race sex are.

Not saying agree law, common misconception people tend age discrimination. time i'd wear mask post-vaccine, would public transit. many people smashed subway cart. Otherwise, sometimes like take i'm outdoors. Can't smell air, flowers keeping on. Also, can't really talk well one on. sometimes hard time understanding friends gf saying, mask muffles words. 

No thank you. could help crowded public spaces flu symptoms. everyday life know it’s called Spanish flu? Comparing Sweden neighbors shows much idiot Tegnell is. sustainable? Yeah lets talk Norway gets 5,000 deaths LOL USA Cocaine? economy?  Look hang outside reasonably distanced other. Going indoors groups size going risky matter well-ventilated is. definitely sucks Canada starts getting really cold. Religion one reasons 'World-Ending Rapture' type stuff.... make ultimately ironic, ones *fueling* it. Like stupid people top new york building alien invasion Independence Day saying 'BEAM UP!' first get obliterated. proven long ago mate \*checks Norway's statistics\* 

270 deaths vs. Sweden's 5,000 +?

Riiiiiight. seem sustainable.

Face facts Swedes. idea dumb still is. pretty obvious read comments actual users linked to. **Sorry trigger you.** Cool story. Cuomo gets blamed one saying anything Texas continues thing nursing homes......

Makes think talking point right downplay everything else he's done. least excuse one first deal US. God forbid, one thing wrong dozens others right. mean, gotten better isolating elderly. Young people make disproportionate share cases across US around world. That's one key reasons CFR gone spring (improved testing better treatments hospitals additional reasons). fact feasible force 15% US population remain homes full year. money, many vulnerable elderly people can't take care need assistance younger people. Outbreaks nursing homes happened residents ""cowards"". mention isolation elderly led thousands additional lives lost dementia. countries fewest COVID deaths excess mortality general ones controlled spread virus elderly people first place (like parts Africa), ones somehow managed make spread among young.

And yes, visited grandmother many times since beginning pandemic. lost husband unknown (but probably non-COVID) causes January since struggled greatly depression made jokes mom swallowing Ambien. Since extremely careful get infected we've decided potential benefits mental health greater potential risks visiting. imagine probably thinks mask mandates joke he's laughing praise he's getting this.

The bar philanthropy low days. mean ass-ponential growth got healthcare system overrun. ass-ponential growth killed almost half Florida? GTFO. There’s growth whatsoever. Texas Florida Arizona surged 10-20 days boom it’s gone zero intervention. ain’t growth stop drinking Koolaid hearing college students are.more mire cities longer period single event single city.

Currently, college aged demographic driving outbreaks numerous cities. absolutely called dealt that. Ignoring reason silly. case city decided something it. Whining saying ""what sturgis"" argument measures worse silly, downright stupid. large entourage. Yep, thinking school! would make coming back person much less anxiety-filled. donating computers need masks instead. infection curve really something else, interesting undercounted cases march april. curve many MANY infections way less deaths( far). would time add restrictions deaths start rising significantly. [I never gotten search result got mine last weekend! one particularly easy painful. Yeah, I'm Billings. People getting pretty lax. We're bringing ourselves... think want see data accept it. That's fair. FDA serious strengthening requirements, likely quick.

It's NY's best interest reassure NYers right encourage people get vaccine. people trust state governments right federal government, may help boost vaccination rates one available. mean second half comment explains first half right ? Ya, it’s strange one sure. they’ve trying get college students stop partying haven’t. needed relax little could avoided something like coming down. know 99.9% fine, it’s people come contact issue. Ok people go places (besides professor example) 18-22 year olds banned gathering? vulnerable person could walk 30, 40, 50, etc year old Walmart get virus too, people still allowed gather? 

It’s bullshit. restricted select group people’s freedom using questionable reasoning. geriatric oligarchs party make sure someone votes person them. poll location plastered maagot posters paper trail.  surprising paid attention stats all.

The under-40 CFR state 0.05% (1 death per 2,000 cases). people 30, probably half rate. assumed vaccines effective. also ignored colossal upside J&amp;J vaccine - namely requires fewer materials stored way easier.

Other vaccines need stored cold environments remain effective. means would need spend great deal infrastructure store, ship, distribute vaccines. vaccine stores, shipped, distributed infrastructure already - rather building super-cold warehouse store similar truck ship them, use already-refrigerated warehouses trucks. huge upside. it’s one shot rather two, doses would need manage would literally halved. greatly reduces economic impact distributing vaccine, huge upside.

The lower required dosages also means production quicker, doses made similar period time vaccines. means things look promising two-three months now, J&amp;J start serious stockpiling.


Long story short, vaccine proves safe effective, it’ll absolute game changer. Quicker production, easier distribution, it’s one dose, there’s risk someone forgetting get second dose remaining vulnerable. Let’s hope that, vaccine makes it, it’s one. Nope, there: Blank stereotyping anyone's behavior simply due gender sexist. cool. According Trump, improve Death/Case ratio. Every single headline schools carefully worded like this. is, knowledge, little-to-no evidence in-classroom transmission certainly evidence in-person schooling leads kind large community outbreak. 

The virus going anywhere. point think kinds risks benefits worth it, aren't. Opening schools area 15% positivity rate? Probably bad idea! NYC like 1% *months.* one? gross underestimation. wear masks. Trump rallies Petri dishes. It’s like random Thursday order came down. CU exploding cases, better idea please share it. live outside boulder please, I’m ears. forum social media. Sorry Chinese propaganda told china already vaccine? would lie that?

No, four vaccine candidates China currently phase 3 trial various countries. approved emergency use various countries including China itself, none yet approved full scale mass deployment phase 3 trial results yet odd China time line usa vaccine supposed come out.

No not, Ad5-nCoV, adenovirus vector vaccine CanSino running example. lab came relocated Beijing Wuhan 26/01/2020 closer action, 3 days Wuhan lockdown. countries 26/01/2020? working china need vaccine controlled outbreak well zero infections china?

Because vaccine available border control measures longer required?

Because started working vaccine full blown outbreak China?

Because working vaccine allows used political capital?

There many reasons would want vaccine even public health measures successful. Think again. look phase 3 testing JnJ, participants yet, mostly Latin American countries already struck deal production. vaccine need frozen one shot dose.

What end happening? USA Europe run Moderna AZ vaccines okay best, severely limited distribution due inherent challenges.

Latin America get JnJ vaccine likely before.

Now African countries might issue, due much lower average age fewer comorbidities, likely ride much better regardless. different think. people know either die recover COVID-19. 

No need recovery testing couple weeks’ patience. Go check World meter look growth phase country didn’t contain virus, reach exponential growth.

How even doubt, it’s easiest thing verify. relative mine came sometbing wild saying flu shot covid-19 flu vaccine one. anyone confirm coocoo can't read article verify - speak assume swedish. 

I'm ignoring anything. Sweden's hoping herd immunity 70%+ population expose covid gain natural antibodies. US strategy gain herd immunity vaccines. 

About 21% people living New York City covid antibodies. opinion, New York City achieved herd immunity? cases deaths dropped NY? completely independent distancing measures? 10% immune cost 200K dead, 60% immune like 1.2 million dead. Exactly. Every country different, outcomes differ countries - even optimal strategy done everywhere. also, optimal strategy probably differ countries well. vaccine gets approved nationally available NY...there gonna hell pay wherever political affiliations land What? *still* awful, top 10 countries deaths. Despite largest social spending, health care (unless old need fudge ICU numbers) on.

Absolute disaster shame pathetic Swedish response. worse yet, single sign anyone learned errors. genuine apology someone admitting fault, preparation next crisis. got distracted calling autistic making hurtful comments. Take upvote, he’s going take downvote November 3rd.

Vote fuckers. Democracy needs you. He's leading minority government definition ""most"" Canadians voted vote (we 2 political parties).

I think reddit gets skewed view many people like though. lot seems come conservatives harp he's ""weak"" (the type people think Trump powerful 🤷🏻‍♂️) latch whatever Conservative party overblown trying turn scandal week. legitimate things criticize Trudeau government focus asinine things. Sorry, zoom happy hours aren’t happening. never happening. 
It’s **a** perspective. keeps surprising sudden perspective **no** deaths **any** social economic costs COVID19, normal flu year, people don’t give shit people die. That’s normal... 

It’s simply proportionate.


And one right mind Sweden celebrating. November also way early tell. Get back year. three. Wow that's massive increase 😢 next one many predicted peak March still worrying.

Universities opened (I'm halls, yikes) expect numbers keep increasing. add tho this, also several examples Hong Kong Korea well. Yeah want travel global pandemic, risk take. Wrong, virus spreads globe, live global economy, even shut entire country two weeks, would still exist places come right back, reach community spread, called ""two weeks kill virus"" work bud. 

Fauci admitted early may see exact amount people infected, spread longer period time hospitals arent overrun. whole purpose shutdowns. CONTROL STOP. never stop. 

People avoided serious conditions kill fucking virus kill them, turns out, people dying result serious conditions. Attitudes like exactly we're mess. Texas, Florida, Arizona, South Carolina others exactly suggest cost thousands lives. Stop cherry picking data supports belief look what's really happening. 

States better numbers NYC rural - NYC population 27,000 people per square mile want compare NH, population density 148 people per square mile. 27,000 opposed 148. 

No one arguing stay hiding beds - ignorant attitudes ""Everything fine, back normal!"" keep getting us right back here. Certainly, are. So, there’s that. GPS data spread corona virus hot March/April. new data visualizations that? EU Canada amongst others seeing 2nd waves. phone GPS data say that? 

  dont know downvoted. valid question. Finally, creative thinking disease medical options!!! wouldn’t Americans wanting vaccine able take trip China it? Serious question talking test results honest, I’m glad U.S. isn’t ordering Chinese vaccines. imagine sort headlines “Chinese poison” that’ll magically appear. deaths probably undercounted r/hmmm That's really good point too! Sense smell amazing start pay attention it. Interesting! COVID smells like sweet unpleasant odor.  Maybe ester. Make dogs pay dog tax. pay Homer tax. agree lockdown stop spread right now. I’m disagreeing notion preventable deaths reason stay locked down. 

At point it’s better understood hospitalizations brazy anymore, live fact virus kill us. That’s choice stay healthy visit grandmother. can’t charge choices rather government telling us can’t go, whom, long, etc?

What jumps me, however, fact able obtain samples *[14 patients, seven positive seven negative trained dogs period days sniff samples thousands times.

Now, I'm expert, know dogs learn sniff characteristics 14 individuals present samples *other presence absence covid-19*. 

If showed portraits 14 people ten thousand times gave reward every time picked positive one could probably get close 100% accuracy, too. mean spot COVID looking face.

Any actual scientists/statisticians care weigh tell I'm wrong? dogs get covid? thought could carriers... combo bad politicians bad compliance safety measures. 

It's happening everywhere level. France, Spain UK screwed well... politics face emergency discipline follow guidelines. Combine bad reopening basically made people believe virus gone perfect storm.

Antarctica currently 0 deaths. comparison, seems like New Zealand let virus run wild. guys adopted Antarctica strategy, 25 lives would spared. 

It’s crime humanity there. aware Sweden’s 5,878 deaths, 5,515 July 1? Go back bunker. Holy fuck, that's amazing like luck pre-COVID anyways offense literally idea you’re talking about, coming across either extremely low IQ, 13 years old (tops). emergency curfew law. Very. Clearly. Legal. That's... statistic. flu closer that. 10% around 30 million. know catching infections.

The better phrasing ""possibly immune"", tho, answer questions immunity duration. We're pretty sure 3 months now, least. awkward First all, infected CV never visible symptoms. looks like situation half people active cases. Secondly, people eventually show symptoms contagious days become symptomatic.

The point is, 3000 exposed college students day walking around cities towns means entire community country going see case rate go up. Shopkeepers, bartenders, food service workers, pedestrians street, parents grandparents, younger siblings, teachers TAs, people risk infected students. 

In middle highly-contagious pandemic, think whole society, individuals. Well, duh! video actual rehearsal wearing masks actually mattered. singing dancing (so lots heavy breathing) people surprised?  Misread comment, thought said employees went work knowing it. Baby born run Nobody triggered dude anybody sub condemned large gatherings mourning RBG’s death? okay play different rules politically agree it? men get taken seriously hate going doctors complaint it’s seen issue overcome innate resistance go Southern states made sure surpass NY per capita, and, cases, numbers.

There excuse kind infection rates deaths knowing happened NY. That's anecdotal evidence, scientific study like one article still hear intro mp3 every time see reference. Apparently intelligence dogs 2 year old child, loving pets. like dog meat festival except pigs ugly one cares. dude good. basement dwellers sub death numbers go down?!? None true. political talking point ones office right rural country closed schools nyc...nyc never shut subways, shut lots things later places. Hindsight 20/20 cuomo everything wrong. Yes, are. new pretend form Swedish exceptionalism, ""we might deaths, actually best counting"". ""The best country world"" turned one worst, ""many"" ""a few"".

Norway Denmark many people dying moment Sweden, that's also false. Tegnell master Giesecke said back March ""wait see, Norway catch up"". Never happened, nobody believes anymore. whole defense Swedish ""strategy"", turned big bluff.

Focusing ""rate increase"" countries like 1 death week bullshit make Sweden look less terrible. I'm talking provincial aid via federal government.

I'm healthcare worker London get near test march. Now, access antibody testing (going next week!) testing via work. *some* PPE (not enough something.) progress also there's big backlog pockets people can't access testing. perfect think better was

Maybe I'm trying optimistic! would surprising? We’ve known early virus kills mostly old people pre-existing conditions. Yup, first friend meetups strange nice too... back couple weeks major restrictions. start end that. None true. That's funniest thing I've read day - realize crazy sounds.

Just educational concerns - trade schools universities - non-profits. means pursue year-over-year profit books. like charities, means management tends take good money everyone else gets screwed.

Then followed 'the teachers get paid substantially less' - yes, nothing says 'we're getting best brightest teach children' like 'these literally lowest salaried employees could find job'.

I'm guessing they're afraid understand whole pandemic thing works. Either that, they're woefully political affiliation convinces overblown, leader come within 1000 feet someone tested first. certainly seem work France Spain. Everyone wears mask cases still spiking. want Mitch McConnell anywhere near healthcare, thank you. Federal? No. Texas, well we're going reopen even harder ignore it. probably necessary. Unless unknown force killing 50-75k Americans, excess deaths prove it’s undercounted. Oh, it’s again. surprise. chose second option. expressly said goal merely slow spread, without taking measures designed stop it.

Yes, crucially first option stomp failed uncontrolled community spread detected. initial spread returning travelers Italy (and later Austria) contained effective contact tracing campaign. 

I’ve told conveniently forget - possibly hard time accepting Sweden succeeding something. happens. often, occasionally. 

I’ve also shown [New Zealand pandemic states exactly NZ would done initial efforts failed. didn’t didn’t go part. Congratulations. 

Now don’t forget time. talk ”Masks” time? 
If take mask sing still socially distanced aerosolize virus closed room air recirculation, then: 

CDC data needs Re-Update Airborn guidelines, right? 

Also think mode entry could Airborn via Eyes!!! sweden higher temperature cause warm water flows europe. ALaska cold freezing except northern part. think learned predictions future completely useless. Remember back March everyone thought would May? Except Sweden, course.  Classic strawman people happy.

Top 2 comments whining people happy without any... real proof. can't United States like Europe? /s give billionaires money pandemic obviously. people read article? says sweat smells different like offices. Yeah sing talk 8 hours. wave this? Due large part medical resources overwhelmed. spike saw south due congregating indoors AC cooling things aiding spread. 

Also, least Texas sounds like Florida too, refusing respond virus. Texas told people basically stop hiding go live life, lt gov literally said ""there important things living"" like economy. We've mask mandate like couple months, plus closing bars back likely reason cases dropped. School back, they're re-reopening everything, getting colder we'll back inside again, Texas going see bad. least get cold late December. patio weather next months. Oh fuck off. First cancer heart disease literally hundreds different conditions whereas covid one. Second, could literally stop cancer wearing mask, people would it. Americans might sociopathic, good people would. okay drunken hookup could be. I’m making predictions future holds. long New Zealand going stay closed outside world? 1 year? 5 years? 10 years? fault media. Average person thinks coronavirus spreads grocery stores. Nah, private events people know ""trust"" real danger.  oh man supposed eat boot... model observed statistics. hard rule science actual results trumps theory. best projections show 15% country infected. Let's assume they're immune (cases re-infection far minimal they're statistically irrelevant). major question natural immunity exposure coronaviruses. one hypothesis Asia Oceania seen high numbers west - many people region prior exposure form immunity. Agreed. call work, cost vacation day scheduled work Saturday. wife actual career actual vacation days sick days gets little leeway. awesome taking one team (although, kids like better anyway)  town bordering Myanmar currently lockdown two smugglers made across border. places went past months. Maximum duration around 4 weeks.

Nanjing, Jiangsu saw 1 imported case early September. 7,000 people tested response. They're thorough dealing virus - local officials keenly aware political career might end right spot let outbreak spill out. that's covid crumbles **Second** mask opposing governer catch Covid (the first OK's Stitt) - anyone think maybe pattern risky behavior here? think want home????  Thanks reply. Couple points, shape data California different UK, France, Spain etc. part confuses me, I've seen response number cases going (in terms per set volume population) deaths trending way. lot longer 2 weeks numbers shooting up.

I'm way saying won't, lag seems big rise cases rise deaths.

Also, I'm sharing clip around, I'm trying fathom out, least better understanding. There’s arguing someone touch delusional are. 

You know else happens time? Old people die. 80,000 COVID deaths people aged 84 up. 

There never another COVID lockdown states thats right thing do, contrary say high horse. 

Goodbye forever. people talk need protect high-risk people making fun high-risk individual got Covid disagree them, good look. people days would never something harm others without thinking first. Fuck world honestly. It’s called accountability wanna dumbass held accountable actions Dude, know sort weird obsession this, college hasn’t going even six weeks. could still system. School secretary here. confirm. district roughly 7,000 students two part-time nurses share ten schools. (Don’t worry, though! employ 4 full-time cops.) means 99% time, I’m one dispensing meds, taking temperatures, administering Epis, figuring insulin dosages diabetic kiddos, etc. Ho Chi Minh city mega city Vietnam? Hanoi pretty populous nearly hcm level
Edit : Also comments thread mentioned population matter, density is. Population density Vietnam big cities deed really high. No, lol. Children aren’t even current trials. Ah unfortunate I'm furry guess I'll take vaccine then.  PR stunt. Irrelevant 99% citizens. live within mile Walmart barely curb side pick-up. faith vaccine drones matrix providing pandemic testing. Well, main point worst hit countries (peru, mexico, equador etc) hit roughly like New York went down. see data course third world countries like can't afford much testing official figures much lower, excess mortality good measure.

Then, would cdc wrong percentage people needed get infected herd immunity?

You read arguments made Karolinska Institutet Stockholm, Sweden, one well respected medical universities  Sigh... *unzips* Crocodile tears. Hey now. Missourian.. confirm. lol dude hope pay get help move Chinese slum. prisons guess go criticizing government all. let's hear say ""Tiananmen Square real"". prolly can't get past filters huh Many many people suffer mental illness substance abuse...many people live homes. yes sometimes mental health issues lead violent behavior it’s bs blanket epidemic caused income inequality ooh theyre scary! People streets aren’t dangerous things, they’re often dangerous they’re cast society, lack adequate resources get help need, treated criminals rather members communities. I’ve worked many homeless people assumptions damaging baseless. Poverty isn’t crime. Homelessness isn’t judgement character. Don’t nimby. even nimbys like nimbys. US now. Read Cares Act. Every employer required give paid sick family sick leave. even cover student 14 can't go school for. 12 weeks. Yeah, that’s good measurement started fall cliff.  That's involvement life successfully happen requires large govt ton accountable bureaucracy carry out. see work without significant influence day day way another. I'm you, saying ""i want govt life"" seems unlikely paired needs many.""   ....For good reason. easily spreadable, deadly.

At population level, distinction semantic one. Seriously dude, stop harassing following sub sub. ""no lockdown"" rules widely complied yet not-legally-binding strong recommendations stricter much US. Limits gatherings, high schools closed, limits restaurants bars, requesting many people work home possible, etc. (And course they're already prone ""social distancing"" high rate single-occupant households.) reason people insist Sweden ""did nothing."" Physical therapy home healthcare, DPT expensive long journey Goddamn synths...



Nah, sounds like super cool dangerous job. It’s interesting professionals genetic technology available now. got doctorate degree medical field, definitely opened lot opportunities Maybe. lot places living like pre pandemic seeing drop cases positivity rate. I’m going give much thought US whole 20% seroprevalence.

Have fun looking sorry a** mirror everyday There's probably kind plan run herd immunity schools also limiting kids get tested Russia and/or China propaganda. There's probably kind plan run herd immunity schools also limiting kids get tested College student here. 

I got 6 months ""the true college experience"". 
 time, formed bonds people. lot them! Got involved school life. felt like opportunities everywhere, especially culturally. within school's environment, everyone brimming excitement could feel around you. That's environment someone wants learn in. pay opportunities. 


The ""online courses"" run half time dinosaurs barely know use computer. They're scrambling jobs new environment-- think affects education? Morale goes down, one cares anymore.. get careless rearrange priorities disease outside. That's also happens angsty students take semester off. cases, we're fucked.

Case point, online courses suck too. Bruh parents use send sick school time. Good ol mom "" fine noon"" misread made better (more accurate) response Edgy lived 50 states? Maybe state, cities harder lockdown others. feel like least partially due much emphasis placed saying virus doesn’t really affect young people much early on. narrative would shifted towards high chance lasting effects/illnesses due it, feel like least people would hesitant going bars/large parties 

Also though, young people likely working places contact people, there’s much should, don’t think that’s going happen. People already depressed itching able live again. People watching part life they’ll never get back slip fingers, don’t know much longer they’ll comply. Man's best friend, truly. [BEEEEEEEP JIN YAAANG!! Yeah, it’s going situation everything stays exactly sudden like April 17th 2021 they’ll like “ok, everybody go back normal now.

There gradual improvements vaccine approved. Maybe crossed border  think people going burn enough bridges actually might many relationships following this.

I think Inglorious Bastards let Nazis go, carve swastika let people know really are. Social media posts gonna thrown lot faces. Summary: FDA CDC require White House crony sign anything released, horrifying. suspect response recent release virus airborne quickly pulled back. strongly suspect release proof still good people left FDA CDC, resisting dictatorship within. Us slaves won’t go work know dangerous really is, means 1% people won’t quite rich.

This genocide it’s deliberate. US puppet government weakened within.

The Art Guerrilla Warfare required reading. Trump isn’t going concede whitehouse loses 11/3. one coming save you. Make plan save yourself. I’ve noticed that. could 5 minute email. no. want see people’s reactions. think tell board way. They’re also incorrect. “car lay bed me” lmaoo Flea dog night! lol agree you. prefer able see people's faces mine shown. hate making eye contact awkward smiling/small talk masks eliminate that. realize everyone anti social dry \*shrugs\* learned recently. volunteers heroes. someone who’s high risk, I’m personally grateful them.  hospitalizations? love people post obvious outright lies fact. much people want use force law compel people's students indoor congregation outbreak viral pneumonia can't tolerate obvious public health mandates limiting personal liberty like wearing mask. dichotomy force others liberty jarring.

We enrolled students school in-person classes avoid potential falling victim wrong-headedness. Politics might get students back classroom, ours. Basic science discouraged everything we've done date CDC guidance 2019.

*You* opposition reason, humans living lives. Hmmmh maybe start banning elderly risk public?

The blade cuts ways! Bring back mall crawl. /s scary part double speak used board. literally sending back special needs teachers, yet wording technical classes only. teachers union demanding equal application policy teachers. 

Parents special needs students outraged children used canaries coal mines. rational, logic scientific thinking, it’s obvious go wrong. essence, it’s little bit “straight forward”. I’m sorry am/was condescending though. 

Example: 
* Two countries exact population (10M) real world infection rates (0.5%) two different testing strategies capabilities. 
* Country 1 capacity 1000 tests. would test? people hospitals COVID symptoms. would probably get 50% positive rate. 
* Country 2 capacity 10M tests 10M people. test everyone. positive rate would 0.5%. 

Now use “straight forward calculation” method, would mean analysis would show that:
* Country 1 5M active cases
* Country 2 50 000 active cases (true number)

Ergo, test, less positive cases find per test. Positive rate matters.
 

 
Edit: clear, I’m saying situation Sweden control totally cool. seeing uptick tipping point. currently, clear Danish spread bigger, seriously hope get control soon. Yeah, areas/organizations fortunate faster testing. Nationwide, average 4 days, 63% taking 2 days. PDF warning) many illnesses symptoms...

The flu common cold symptoms also caused covid moved WA AZ it’s incredibly worrying seeing people wear masks there’s mandate here. 

In WA didn’t wear one would ask leave, AZ don’t wear one one bats eye. Uh that’s works. cases community, cases vulnerable groups. vaccine may available high-risk couple months, would want young people getting spreading now?

I’m senior school don’t like way they’re treating us, doesn’t mean think would somehow good thing us get infected.  vaccines, able blood antibody test measure strong remaining immune response whether revaccinate. still going large group people go ahead say effectiveness dogs fake news. ""why dog around virus, even sniffing right nostrils, dog ok, see dog covid issues!!"". It’s necessary clinicians time employee works separate building outside hospitals, too. Sounds like Israel? Definitely seems like one clearest cases opening schools bad idea, since that's outbreaks started. Good luck hope things get control soon without many deaths :( areas US Europe headed something similar I'm afraid...people learn. institute restrictions cases come lot not-very-smart people conclude overkill, necessary, let's open everything back up. Keeps happening over. strong incentive make vaccine. common cold, make vaccine poses existential risk? WA already threw metrics.

Expect kind get along mid 2022ish.

I think outdoor concerts next summer (or music industry survive). I’m close 100% sure one dogs sniff out. morning woke sick, bed whining sniffing around mouth chest. She’s cuddler really strange acting like that. thought maybe go out, normally nudges bed whines bit. got asked needed go laid bed looking me. laid back continued whining sniffing mouth chest. Got tested positive day. Unfortunately, line often used COVID deniers. probably got immediate downvotes. Thank you. recently presentation coworkers base rate fallacy (which linked), asking false positive rates covid tests, find any... 


I even think tests testing something different want. ""Suspicious"" based nothing experience? *In Soviet athlete:* dies, dies. 1 case transverse myelitis probably transverse myelitis.

The system working. Students learning home performing well said, believes help. district found 70 percent students learning remotely failing least one class. really weirds people make big deal it. Maybe people getting masks fit right comfortable? wear puritas 3d mask basically feels like i'm wearing nothing. blue surgical ones bit uncomfortable even big deal. jinx apologized years ago applying liquor license restaurant... Bc charge preventing getting one. Stand dude /s pandemic gone...what?

Even cases increase...what what?

We well never see real surge like March -- where? Sweden?

You go data highlight country here: talking Sweden, definitely true pandemic. Also, I'd encourage visualize log rather linearly (our brains think linear, virus behaves logarithm). Even Sweden's data perfect. Exactly. Actually think people risk healthcare workers get vaccinated we’ll see removed maybe like January Lol. mother teacher high risk serious complications COVID-19. going retire, decided reasons. teaching in-person school already 3 positive cases. school mother think fine 3 cases contained far concerned. months I've begging return in-person instruction I'm trying get see 3 positive cases tip iceberg putting grave danger, want listen (I'm brainwashed liberal her). misleading title. 

Accuracy terrible metric comes identifying outlier events (like finding people COVID, still (thankfully) make small percentage people. 1 person 100% covid, need always say tested person doesn’t COVID 99% accuracy. thing goes detecting earthquakes: every day, say earthquake. Sure you’ll wrong happens, there’s overwhelming amount times you’re right nothing, accuracy terrible metric. 
For interested, F1 score, combining precision recall already step forward taking account even though understand that’s it’s already less accessible. It’s still misleading terrible way convey message IMHO

Edit: data scientist &amp; living near Helsinki btw, aware cases here, making even worse opinion. far know still allowed mask distance want? mean haven’t whole time? shoving turtles ass looking cancer. Greater genetic diversity means likely would need multiple vaccines/treatments.

Think flu requires annual vaccine. New strains flu resistant old antibodies. currently Virginia restricted list, supposed self quarantine two weeks arrival state. many? Source please? shame surveillance done citizens China consistently fails see new pandemic starts late. Yeah. There's ton looks this. Mixed results best.

Is dangerous? Probably not. help? Maybe? does, modestly though.

Not worth recommending broadscale medical resources much better served looking new options. medical community (rightly) moved on. I'm wait list service dog like $30k, luckily non-profit let's set payment plans passes $12k recipient. bird flu, Mad cow disease squirrel pox? update those? 7 months restrictions :( Well, fwiw, opinion recent scientific meeting attended (at liquor store involving me, another customer, liquor store manager) masks another 12 months. Bruh. Didn’t get memo indoor maskless choir practice bad right now? That’s pretty common health care, right? least years RI. That's current pandemic news too. Downplayed Oh, yes, see. Agreed. Plus, even get pet working dogs. ;) bit Star Trek type device detect diagnose everything smell. dog’s nose simply better sensor manufacture. No, like let's threaten fine thoughtless young adults certainly smart enough understand basic science continue choose jeopardize public health anyway.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* New versions article keep popping every day. Wish way filter silliness out. anybody good article chart simply answers following: 

**What average age covid-19 deaths?**


A Google Search seems obscure rather clarify. get results like [this Isn’t zinc supplement shown clinical trials inhibit reproduction common cold coronaviruses? see lot comments dismissing way Vitamin C dismissed. Ie: problem deficient. think that’s accurate regards prevention, mechanism zinc isn’t same. 

If someone infected COVID, vitamin becomes depleted rapidly critical immune system function. Vitamin C well. seems me, fighting active infection home, D, C, zinc would benefit. nothing “they shout closely don’t wear masks ego. 

You’re using sexist pseudo science. hey you’re trade men Hur dur. 

Like said see way women shit. see isn’t science.  That’s like arguing see White women anti vaxxors selling oils believe fake, must get sick 


No biological functions. isn’t saying catch more. It’s differing affects can't sing together zoom. programs trying work latency issues choir, never going work. Even wired internet connections great software often solve latency. 

I agree choir extremely dangerous. Even outdoor sessions masks dangerous. need straw straw man? Sounds like Horizon Zero Dawn. Great.... It’s disgusting government hasn’t shielded individuals making choice.

If someone forced choose death bank foreclosing home, would even consider allowing bank take home. stranger whose life abstraction me, home represents everything I’ve ever worked for. problem lies choice, presented choice begin with. hearing wait two weeks since states started opening four months nothing happening.

uh...you might want expand media intake bit. early July US 7 day average deaths got 'low' high 400s. month later averaging 1,200 day yet dip 750. 

Here Texas places like Florida Arizona hospitals coming dangerously close capacity - saved us governors waking reality rolling back openings (bars closed Texas since June 26, although exceptions)

You want talk Georgia? saw [a huge spike cases 

New Hampshire? really love cherry-pick stats, let's go it. 7-day-average new cases 15 reopened restaurants, doubled. said, number still really low maybe see spike. 

Either way, great example since largest city population 100,000 people. want compare MA? 5 cities larger that, including Boston population 7 times larger. Population density matters. mention New Hampshire sees hell lot less travelers than, say, Boston.

Also important note, NH ""fully"" open restaurants - still require 6 foot table spacing people allowed congregate standing bars. restaurants 6 foot table spacing puts roughly half pre-pandemic capacity. 

And hate break you, also allowing indoor dining 6 foot spacing. yes, makes sense they're cautious since [the CDC confirmned restaurants source remind people Texas screaming full reopen May - ""The numbers low!"" - month later lock back down, reopen slowly smartly. mean that's literally subreddit like back March. remember people going nuts videos people collapsing streets China. 

People acting like apocalypse. that's shown false, criticism actions taken. upsets people like call anyone loving thought locked anti lockdown trolls. remember I'm talking about. Yes saying spread. That's difference school districts disclosing infections though. labeled “Inconclusive News”. No, dog false positive rate 1%, still “99% accuracy” despite saying tens people coke crowd thousands one coke. Seriously look 7 day rolling chart checkout trending average, pretty much flat/slight decrease last month, minus extreme dip around labor day. 

Whats likely here, weeks weeks consistent flat/slight decline data wrong 1 week extreme dip wrong here.

There real spike happening here, data data. get clicks. starting months ago mobile getting kids sleep now. either article posted removed offtopic, dn.se, eant search now, otherwise look late tonight. Wit? sub overwhelmingly pro-masks it’s repeated every Swedish post months Start tesing ‘em streets! R.I.P Hah! lost want hyphen! funny. Oh remember early days too, following since first article novel virus affecting Wuhan China came mid January... Ever try sound smart dumb? “The UK reported 6,634 new coronavirus cases - highest daily total ever recorded.

40 new coronavirus deaths also recorded.” HEL-Hounds. haha mean often COULD replicate it, costs development time would astronomical... could instead train influence existing biological process fit needs minor fraction cost. first group parents class leeches. parent, you, scum worthy parent.

I feel spot money, though. guy data sciences.   see, I’m trying argue even announcement net benefit whatsoever current pres. it’s something put name like group project lol. Nobody’s decision 11/4 hinges announcement, doesn’t matter 99.9% voters won’t access vax months announcement skill set learn job? governor rando sociopath resigned investigation multiple crimes. Lt. never went college stepped got rona. think skilled people voting many cases. La garra charrúa Nobody offered one. whatever floats boat... Hey let's hope there's new fucked pandemic but, early days current one, played down. are. Fucked bar set low. Personally think Cain would done better aliens invaded. fact is, boiling money vs lives. ordinary, everyday people, choosing lives. would rather struggle less expense people's lives. That's fucking disgusting. also don’t allow N95 masks anymore “vents filters” 

What??? mean use P101 either?

You can't spread COVID get infected, fairly safe assumption P100 mask. bug, it’s feature ... keep us destablized undermine public trust. Trumpelstilkskin feeds chaos. No. It’s unique ailment signature own. It’s blood vessel disease respiratory upper respiratory ailment. Anyone comparing automatically null book.  

The symptoms immune system response similar human. real need tests? dogs accurate test apparently Awesome news. Positives way down, deaths way (7 day average lowest since June), hospitalizations low. Lol.

Nothing happening.

Ignoring 300% increase deaths Florida Texas. Yes, one detected earlier. case months?

More young people getting tested school responsibilities.  think immunity before.  pretty obvious active young people spreading even early days, people existing 24/7 nursing homes. Choynaaa Kasich wasn’t terrible remember Damn it. need new fake ID now. Ignoring measures also cost. instance UK expecting 35k excess cancer deaths due lockdown earlier year. Similar warnings cardiologists course mental health crisis looming. pushed poverty restrictions.

Poverty well know wonders long term health population. 

So extending prevention next year magnify damage. course, one cares die, care enforcing death socialising people. Last time tried, get even paid, unless met certain absurd requirements. sniffer needs adjustment. Everytime (shit) Trump impression, use video template. Family Guy character president that's hilarious That's gross thing say loud, even true.

I hate planet. Yet bad US. point MASKS HELP. Like everything life arent perfect. Theyre like seatbelts, dont guarantee survive help LOT. Plus, studies show viral load matters. exposed LARGE amounts virus worse outcomes. So, get infected wearing mask, likely “viral load” body exposed wont kill you, make sick, virus caught mask. longer lag usual we're talking multiple generations. Even so, trend downward flattening basically stopped CDC already updated said virus airborne linger quite while. Cloth masks don’t work anything unless someone sneezes small percentage infections. Think cloth mask many ways would stop microscopic virus like thinking underwear prevent anyone smelling fart close herd immunity yet. 6% tested covid antibodies May. highest curreny estimations suggest around 30% could immune - number backed antibody test. Instead, calculation generous assumptions. either case, numbers significantly lower ~67% needed reduce covids innate R0 around 3 1. herd immunity achieved vaccination well. That's USAs plan rather expose population covid like Sweden. Yea, that’s usually college works thanks support! announcing one approved, actually follow-through. Sending kids school flu season danger kids, COVID far deaths go. I'm ""it's flu"" bro, I'm saying data shown children. 

2018-2019 flu killed 266 0-4yrs 214 5-17yrs.

Those numbers 15 ages 1-4yr 31 5-14yrs. Different age ranges enough tell story. 

Lots lots evidence showing spread adult child, reverse much child child. Obviously happen happened much several studies. keep teachers safe properly go long long way.  can't believe many parents US actually can't afford kid all, still them. know accidental pregnancies, I'm talking them, maybe time people consider whether actually kid going forward, clear help, children responsibility strangers (in case, teachers).

This sort side thought, ignorant enough beforetimes think people could handle it, otherwise it. LOL @ me.  car lays driveway. POS, care all. guess swine-sight 2020. say 99% posts would valid. polite. definitely helps cool person down, read that. It’s odd. I’ve gotten results around 24 hours times I’ve tested, friends wait like 5 days. must use experience critical thinking evaluate world around us, course things news.

And experience, family, many vaccination sessions leads think either outlier 3% really low probability ""mild pain application site"" vaccine. Even dogs kind scratched licked location shot ocasionally seemed sore clearly tired! see. last \~20 odd years yearly bird flu scares amounted nothing novel species jumping virus that's deadlier average flu ***and*** extremely efficient spreading person person still pretty rare. 

Covid happened needle haystack broke mold. it’s going herd-developed

Jesus fucking christ. I’ve suddenly strong desire stop snorting dogs smelling viruses, they're smelling effect covid body. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* nythro OrionBell said, little strawman argument, worth taking seriously. ""first messages Covid"" user referencing fallacious, apocryphal stereotypes, cannot substantiated actual evidence earlier pandemic.

Not that, user appears one anti-lockdown users brigading sub. majority previous posts comments lockdown-critical subs. reason disregard argument.

Long story short: strawman possible troll. idea comment many upvotes. Ok entirely unfair. couple reasons. 1. Adults 22 aren’t behaving reasonably. 2. CDC could push months didn’t (and still doesn’t) affect young people. 3. schools still person classes requiring students fork massive amounts cash “college experience” doesn’t exist anymore. 

Having gathering (a sensible, small gathering 5-10 people) 18-22 reckless senseless parents get together 52. Blaming pandemic college kids essentially forced return campus (or else fall behind peers/lose large amounts money) short sighted. falls squarely shoulders government didn’t get shit reasonable level MONTHS ago Good luck one, people hate masks want rid ASAP. crushing winter people burn move whether vaccine ready not. didn’t vote either definitely happy living Canada right now. think “isn’t great leader” comment referring fact seems sit middle issues, wanting upset either side. end day though, progressive views vocal isn’t dangerous way leaders position power. Even government’s response isn’t perfect, set fairly good example citizens terms equality, seriousness COVID, etc. that’s said leaders countries. Idk President holding maskless rallies thousands? don’t see better college students throwing parties? TIL coronavirus immunity begins age 23. go spread friends, spread friends, spread came back Italy early March.

In EU, tagged every airport extra security screenings.

I got back US breezed right JFK. even said ""I got back Italy, need anything me?"" 

""No.""

Didn't even tell quarantines anything.

I quarantined 2 weeks. money. Using dogs would cost less provide less jobs. going one two reasons point imo. think disaster lockdown causing hurts trump ego won’t let admit wrong lockdowns worse virus. many communities lost many businesses overreaction. take years many places recover ever I'd love know think exponential growth means context.  need get popcorn first. OK Go. america, 200,000 people already dead, last projection looked said potentially another 200,000 january 1, worst case projections showing another 400k dead.

The death rate somewhere around 1% places, communities much harder hit others.

I really understand able understand quantification yet, every sort media like 4 months now. Theoretically hospitalizations large increase cases amongst children interact teachers staff. That's literally reason much concern even know flu deadly kids COVID. RiGHt SeND KiDS ScHoOL. 

Probably gonna get downvoted, I’m sick hearing stupid shit news. 

I don’t know hard send kid school. schools putting much emphasis absences leading poor report cards, bosses giving leeway parents miss day two children sick? I’m assuming (while giving benefit doubt, I’m sure parents don’t give fuck kids) parents sending kids can’t afford miss day work hire babysitter day.  “Paul, Kentucky Republican, challenged Fauci congressional hearing, saying think Fauci ""end-all,"" ""the one person gets make decision"" regarding reopening US economy coronavirus pandemic.”

Fauci responded ""never made (himself) end-all voice this"" noted ""there number"" officials weigh administration's strategy.

""I'm scientist, physician public health official. give advice, according best scientific evidence,"" 
May Senate hearing Tuesday, Republican Sen. Rand Paul criticized government experts response Covid-19 plans reopen country. Paul directed ire Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases member White House coronavirus task force, frequently urged caution US states reopen.

""Dr. Fauci, every day seem hear things can't do,"" Paul said.

[Paul went onto claim FALSE statement that] “there's great deal evidence actually good, good evidence kids transmitting this,
”
July incident today. 
(See Reddit post)

This demonstrated behavior Rand try ignore science discredit Dr. Fauci add credibility false claims he’s making. ignore facts behind Dr. Fauci say “if Rand interrupts enough listen him” encouraging behavior also wrong. Dr. fauci says something Rand doesn’t like, (like children get pass Covid) Rand says doesn’t like answer tries ignore it.

Maybe one agenda one keeps arguing expert? 🤔 study finds. school raising all, patents provide place sleep freshen New York one of, first state implement mandatory mask policies still place today. people also scared shitless getting sick behaved (at least first).

New York's early numbers shit WAY anyone knew early measures based numbers. definitely shut earlier that's happens listen government saying ""it's big deal"" months secretly spreading whole time. Sweden socialist country strong social safety net, proper sick pay free healthcare. find hilarious people like Paul hold Sweden example completely ignoring this. FFS!. People getting stupid every year... Well you’d wrong. Minorities affected really inconceivable china could created virus. exactly upstanding country. Look treat Muslims shocking turn events, airborne. Yes, right thing do.We already lockdown.

No. happens time.

No. kids can't afford unable take care properly 

No. always risk opening business.

Yes, lives far important things, even 65. work school, surprise. sad thing call parent come get kid, argue you. I'm saying mom right bring feverish child daycare. know much PTO money family has? Sure hope you’re right fella I'm sure, think Sweden unplug people dead/braindead.  Considering you, guess, idea Rand Paul means don’t know he’s spreading misinformation deadly pandemic that’s sweeping world. It’s pretty good idea health experts correct dangerous statements, wouldn’t think? Thats saying okay. think anyone... (/sigh... ok maybe people. ).. confused transmits.

There difference airborne virus someone sneezed face transmission though. 

If that's frustrating difference, challenge find reputable health agency classifying COVID 19 officially airborne.

It seems like me, I'm lay person seen I'm saying response saying ""we know fully airborne."" I've ahead curve since January. Planned, prepared researched since outbreak Wuhan. History repeat sure rhyme. truly hope I'm wrong.  Imagine hating people never met much deny things like affordable healthcare, either. 

That's America. Imagine disconnected reality. everyone camp moms basement eating tendies. Welcome real world. everyone easy. proof doesn't

Fauci cites ""the best available data"".  Since USA gave testing, sadly possible percentage HIGHER that, sure.

But nobody KNOWS, can't make good public policy.  whole thing complete cluster fuck USA.

RP wrong claim ""herd immunity levels reached NYC"" without data.  Fauci citing best available data. Note Fauci CHANGE VIEW better data available. That's science done. Yes post market observational analysis that's nearly good placebo controlled trial. 

I get EUA coming election going cause lot problems. thoroughly without clue. Lol side coin school involve Children Family Services keep child home ""too much"". That’s great news, widely available April certainly ahead past projections. Likely December year urgent doses frontline workers vulnerable population. used little respect Rand Paul. lot, little. longer. get steroid inhaler dog's chronic bronchitis... *$300* USA pharmacy, $100 Canada. 

Of course, takes weeks get plan ahead. Get rid gameshow host values ratings lives. Haha Given propensity hit urban minority ""essential"" workers I'd take side bet Yes comrade. Pass vodka. Sweden lucky Swedish workers belong labor union. Collective bargaining works raises wages benefits even nonunionized workers. Also, corporate America smoother government? Give actual example history shows government bailing corporations pretty often. Well hes right isnt he. want, free  No. 3M's fault. trump administration's can't. side want truce. want war.

Literally.

Evangelicals twisted end-of-the-world prophecy they're getting sick waiting for. 

Evangelicals vote every election whatever think bring end world fastest.

Seriously.

I've never h anyone offering benefits 40hours. I'm tying find something similar Lol @ 1 3. Give break. long enough secondly stuff describe inflammation happens get sick anything. enough people dying scare way. Omg shoooooocker Bridge divide? sciences stupidity?

Sure, go ahead ask cat mice bridge divide too. plenty data contradicts Faucis statements

when make claim like - need cite sources.

Fauci cites CDC says 22% ""herd immunity level"".  
please show sources say 22% herd immunity level. Google it. Geez people... Honest question. mean can't afford kids? Ugh. roll eyes talk “we shouldn’t giving stimulus. need think debt affect future generations.” Like give fuck anyone themselves. true. ""hardworking American persona"" rearing ugly head too. I've noticed prevalence people complaining anyone wants stay home must lazy. Even they're sick symptoms. ""You're lazy taking advantage situation. Get lower paying job instead asking increase unemployment staying laid off""


It's really disappointing folks staying home safe they're able. facilitating that. cool, he's clearly age 50 looks fit fiddle. could go wrong? Seatbelts prevent enjoying life's basic elements though???? 3 year old developed slight cough last weekend appeared tired. preschool policy, can't come unless negative covid test. kept home preschool, cancelled social obligations took get tested covid. came back negative (90% accuracy). pediatrician explained extremely common rampant viruses still there. 3 patients day come symptoms also test negative.

Later 10 month old popped fever - surprise, he's fucking teething. know know him. pops fever every night tooth breaks he's working molars right now. allergist (anaphylaxis we're narrowing testing) see 2 weeks regardless test results. Okay. ""quarantine"" let's count.. 6th time? ANAPHYLAXIS know cause hold find out. even get started epipen took full month fulfill ""because covid"". get serious anaphylaxis?

On one hand, get it. real we're fighting it. know I'm lucky position take kids out, keep home. we're lucky we're financial position insurance keep taking get tested, otherwise we'd stay home them.

But also wonder point taking toddlers get tested actually risk exposure? sniffles stop. baby teeth go, fevers. covid. knowledge none us have.. going testing center good way get it. (They drive testing littles area. less accurate shallow nasal swab according pediatrician deep nasal swab ""deeply, deeply traumatic young children"". get. love held someone something painful understand. creates fear doctors, get that).

I friend who's daughter anxiety. presents stomach aches, deals frequently requesting see school nurse asking call mom. varied symptoms covid though, stomach ache = get test quarantine, per school policy. 

I guess whole point everywhere relying symptoms little kids feasible. Enough ""partisan bickering"" line. Republican party embraced death cult status alone. nothing Democrats anything rest country/world did.

This 100% them.  Ironic One anti masker time Imagine many pieces equipment vehicles like Humvees Tanks built even need replaced. story Army saying tanks fine congressional rep said need replace constituents need jobs building tanks.

Eisenhower warned us Military Industrial Complex nobody listened.

Now militarized police forces using handed equipment playing soldiers without rules engagement.

Alex Jones called Police State issue totally right that. sister coaching kids say allergies avoid getting sent home sneeze cough. works home doesn’t want deal screaming fits. wants visit Thanksgiving? Ha. Yeah. No. person Universities large gathering. qualities don’t apply though. :( updates random individuals dying death projections super important deserve upvoted. Boomers longer life expectancy following generations. They're deliberately fucking children, themselves. That’s gonna issue hurt feelings, trying write politely outright call stupid. earlier suggestion projecting holds true. read? Goals calls action. need realistically attainable short-term. right accredited accredited worst responses caps roughly New Yorks deaths per capita

according NYT sources, ""worst"" NYC covid death rate 1 260.

that's  million deaths USA data entire world supporting Covid would kill millions Americans nothing,

sure. _only_ 1 million change. ""millions""

 Mostly older people even...

is ok position?  give let happen?

That sound like good political strategy, RP others mask ""opinion"" debating tactics. Even though basically plan.

I get became politics. Viruses known problem. Medical Science develop better treatments / hopefully vaccine.

Until then, reduce infection rate run ICU beds / cold storage bodies overwhelm normal facilities.... Parents suck system sucks expect? happening everywhere

UK thing, sent kids back school cases rising rapidly, university start means thousands people moving otherside country cases rise

Lockdown ended way early trying temporary lockdowns various places working

People go work ill since bills pay, send kids school cant afford childcare. 

Plus people either asymptomatic dont even 2 big signs brush cold Government officials incredibly disconnected reality expect happen. qualities commonly referred Republican. comment using longer form. Lol nope, somethings figured he'd probably say.  many sub can't? want to? 77% upvoted right lol


Most likely another pointless vaccine update bound shifted reach intended target. like lockdown vaccine predictions. Many people, smart people, top people, say sounds like Trump. that’s compliment, generous kind compliment Trump smart man, scored perfect, perfect, Alzheimer’s test. /s 500 cases 3-5 deaths general population.  statistically possible hit someone risk yet. correct response literally anyone surprised?  Challenge trials always done question ethics involved give virus somebody somebody dies result. upside challenge trials they're quicker. Normal trials might see half participants given vaccine told go lives. wait set number people get infected hopefully none vaccine. enough community infections, say vaccine works not. r/coronavirus: ""anti-vaxxers bad""

Also r/coronavirus vaccine le ebic Oxford: ""I'm expressing healthy scepticism"" FWIW agree you. distinct difference virus transmitting via droplets flying air someone's orifices landing you, vs. transmitting hanging air somebody spewed 90 minutes ago getting inhaled someone else. 

As far I've seen, evidence covid capable hanging air like that. estimation, seems lot evidence despite capability, really seem transmit manner effectively all. CBA finding various sources (no one's really talking sources discussion anyway fuck it), one thing look logically. Masks particularly effective tools spread ""truly aerosolized"" viruses like measles, yet masks seem ton covid. almost nowhere anything fight ""fully airborne"" spread, either. see businesses forced add air filtration systems, vent rooms open windows doors, stuff outside, etc. think we'd much bigger problem already thing really spreading via suspended dust droplet nuclei. Fauci looking available data though. Scientists knows something contradict theory theory wrong, plenty data contradicts Faucis statements. seen gigantic death tolls third world countries even know disease now, didn't, instead death curves looks almost exactly New York. perfectly normal sub reality get downvoted, especially goes subs fear mongering agenda. Yeah that's also pointless. mean post link going say something wild. Otherwise sound looney. opportunity educate everyone, share link. another looney person ranting wasting time. actual video happening golden. Full disclosure, opinion Bill Gates bit mixed. say, cannot separate ruthless businessman 20 years ago philanthropist today. completely agree you. fact, fundamental problems anyone hoarding much wealth Bill Gates (regardless philanthropy work). (I want get much debate, recommend wealth skew)

I however think actually done good work foundation. doubt genuinely cares particular issue. earlier warnings global pandemic lend credibility here. He's clearly knowledgeable topic global pandemics effect poorer communities world. Furthermore, efforts spend securing vaccines well entire world, rich west, sense still admirable. put simply, despite problems Gates voice listen issue. (Not one, neither say he's authority issue, definitely sense qualified epidemiologist)  


That said, really disagree anything say. Bill Gates hero mine, neither truly example view (if appoint tech heroes, I'd much rather say Linus Torvalds). mean respect work done. problems form extreme wealth, there's fundamental difference Gates Bezos view. Swedish strategy allow spread? I'd hardly call learning live it, sounds like surrender.

However, important us realistic expectations, avoid accepting unsubstantiated beliefs magical thinking sound good (a common mistake find reasoning lockdown skeptics). so, bare facts expert opinion mind, shall declare *no, vaccine ""fairytale"" endgame might expected*, words one expert CNBC. get hopes that.

According commonly held consensus pandemic professionals, need maintain current precautions while. Dr. Robert Redfield, director CDC United States, forecasted although emergency use authorizations might arrive end year (and even then, optimal circumstances), widespread availability COVID-19 vaccines would wait summer 2021. Dr. Anthony Fauci, national epidemiologist United States, went even predicted safe return pre-pandemic ""old normal"" late 2021 - *over year now*. Dr. Paul Offit, Philadelphia pediatrician former vaccine developer, made bold claims vaccine timeline MarketWatch, going far say Americans continue wear masks socially distance year, even *after* vaccine makes way hands general public; reasoning since vaccine projected 50-75% effective, would still substantial proportion population vulnerable severe COVID-19 infection, therefore safe Americans let guard. prediction exclusive United States, either: Dr. Theresa Tam, Canadian equivalent Dr. Fauci, warned long ago measures would remain *two three years* following approval vaccine.

I think understand phrase applying me. I've never said anything suggest covid19 real. 

My argument assertion 10 years restrictions ridiculous inline reality. 

I'm also violent person would never intentionally cause harm anyone. 

I'm troubled repeated lack empathy downplaying mental health issues tough time however. fear around you. could restricted minority areas right given Filipino, may early indication new outbreak. I’m pretty sure covid. illness unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. respiratory gastro (more gastro). say sure DEFINITE smell. ends. distinct, like nothing stinked before. 

Good doggos. question coronavirus contagious period - 

A close friend went rave (not telling later) one night (around 10pm-4am), said friend brunch next morning (11am-1pm). I'm guessing rave high risk event (unmasked etc) may gotten Covid-19 there. However, brunch 12-15 hours possible infection event. possibility transmission / contagious early got infected? symptoms. need self-isolate? Especially schools. case divulging medical information child. Or, not. Proven studies? please send link?  Downside 6 month trial, 6 months(March) already distributed probably like 200 million vaccines Pfizer Moderna.

This really going used 3rd world countries. countries probably dont think worth meassuring. Plus cant really keep eye mild cases. Scaryest thing much ""idiot"" done comparison real idiot idiot running him. would literally run Hillary popularity contest, considering popular vote 3 MILLION votes. 

(Emphasize added Reddit, you) There’s going significant number people still asking lockdowns, masks ect even pandemic largely rear view. long cases, people claim “what long term effects!” continue plead government make feel safe. It’s bunch hypochondriacs really it’s human nature scared viruses see humans possible vectors. Last time checked, 2.9% mortality rate mate. Also let us assume entire world gets infected corona. means 229.1 million people dead. entire world, would fuck world exponentially, along economy. Keep mind, nearly 2/3 US population. 1/3 population EU. 3 times bigger UK's population. Agree it’s probably single worst thing do. Strong disagree it’s easy replicate Zoom, due sound delay, fact sound seems go one way (when giving piano lessons student playing, can’t hear me, vice versa.) think music groups online recording singing/playing top another recording, layering way. miss choir dearly, except could year years safely sing public again. chiropractors. neither medical doctors exponential growth? Jokes you, America’s erasing progress WAY longer pandemic’s going on!! HA!!! I'm sure countries criterias, Sweden, count recovered must first confirmed positive, test negative 2 times. 
In spring capacity test everyone symptoms, said symptoms, assume covid stay home get better.

Testing people might sick still prioritised testing healthy people, confirmed recovered ones hospitalized hospital needs know treat patient (even he's something covid). 3 cities we're masking up, outside three liberal blueberries huge red blanket.. mean, Stage 3 trial going 6 month trial, probably around March getting accepted FDA. means Pfizer, Moderna probably ones vaccinating US.  Probably before, health agency tells do. 200 dead day ? thought cases drop dramatically weeks ago? Wth punch line probably hurt someone can't needed cures funny situation covid denier hurt someone Half halfway, full nazi. lol every friday state supposed little press conference updated data, every time gets pushed back someone 'tampered it' given 'false data', numbers always jump afterwards. 


It feels like people genuinely Virus' side. Like, Pro-Virus. Like, expect take face someone Scooby-Doo-Style giant Corona Virus underneath it. run scientists case.

Being politician actually skill set. Plucking scientist putting White House would disaster. Now, elected officials need fucking listen scientists place key advisory positions That's country 2.8M. equivalent 16k US, 4,000 Germany. date, CECC said, traced 372 people Taiwan contact 18 Filipino patients. number, 202 deemed close contacts tested COVID-19 virus antibodies, results coming back negative, center According CECC, 25 people traveled Taiwan Philippines past four months tested positive COVID-19 arrival, 0.48 percent total number travelers route comparison, percentage positive cases among travelers Taiwan countries four-month period 0.005 0.055 percent, CECC According CECC spokesman Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥), efforts center obtain detailed information Philippine cases testing process drawn ""vague responses.""

There's narrative people (hint: China) trying promote Taiwan hiding cases avoiding testing.

I think decide likely:

- Taiwan pandemic government trying hide. people dying hordes. Hospitals flooded. Collegues neighbors disappearing.
- virus somenow shuts infect people without causing symptoms enter Taiwanese borders, become active leave Taiwan.
- Philippines Japan nations seeing false positives (as seen extremely low percentage like 0.48% 0.055% compared total travelers Taiwan) quick tests used large scale testing known relatively low accuracy.

A recent political manuver opposition party Taiwan secretly test 4841 high risk (quarantined people front-line hospital workers) antibodies found 4 people testing positive, giving rate 0.00083, 0.083%.

They wanted prove Taiwan mass infections. Instead, proved Taiwan extremely safe virtually infections even among high risk.

One needs understand really happening behind news reports. understand context. one mislead people try portray false impression. Progress towards what? Total environmental collapse due climate change, biodiversity loss/species extinction, resource hyperexploitation? personally think

Right - that's problem. conisder science directly opposed personal opinion. due systemic sexism towards men. Take that, fat haters. What? Johnson Johnson US company? next, doctors offering surgeries nothing, knock out, cut open, see again? MO OK, others? Jesus man. understand arguing opinions site, you’ve blatantly misused word. use correctly next time-for example, could said, “hey chriswmf, statement correlate comment all”.

That correct usage. got stupid question. SARS-nCoV-2 last member SARS-MERS-SARS-nCoV-2 family? another respiratory virus form again? LMK eating hamburger infect whole family hamburgers. Ha! Ha! seriously using printed / offline publication source? Could really find another source backed opinion? 

Goes show may misunderstood survey explained earlier. ""hero""

He's rich racist bigot confessed attacking helpless Asian man vicious hate crime leaving permanant disability. deserves rot... CDC (ironically) actually discussion paper that’s worth reading think first messages Covid - must lockdown everyone die, bodies piled streets, complete collapse healthcare system, 5% fatality rate. patently false point, still accepted truth absurd number people. words - knowledge changed, ability general populace accept new information remarkably stunted. common occurrence crisis - ability disseminate new informational change views remarkably limited. iirc, Texas 20k excess deaths right now. 

I Lol'd downvotes. ask innocent question. sub batshit crazy. really care arguing semantics you.

If need change word possible one works you. Please go ahead. two colleagues losing minds kids home. They're remote periods phones husbands trying get sorted kids remote learning. want kids back school. know I've never happier kids! conspiracy theorists come (such implying something normal ""Tegnell want comment further""), Swedish media extremely strict privacy almost never publishes name non famous individuals case deaths crimes, even strict case child. Something that, honest, think extremely wise really wits end think ""muh implications"" things spoke anyone else , stop trying projecting wish Reddit ""?"" button comments like these. every day 50,000 people ""win"" covid lottery

but gotta play win, maskless definitely winning ticket sooner later *Lockdowns* erased years progress.

Let’s pretend virus this. government’s overly dramatic response caused drastic harm we’ve seen pandemic. Nobody dies meth. comorbidities, primarily tachycardia. didn’t take aggressive masking route clearly saving lives? NJ put mask orders, cases plummet. NY puts mask orders, cases plummet. South Korea masked day one never got control. 

Why? ignore clear cut science? 

For political gain. state full right wing troglodytes think it’s hoax, stay lock step troglodyte president survive politically. killed people power. deserves every single sense. Maybe he’s trying atone previous despicable behaviour? That’s mayor, pushed back openings twice, city. defense infection rate around 1% one lowest country. Schools close hit 3%, wonder bother opening. cyclic. Testing falls little weekend climbs back Mondays .

Yesterday India carried 1.5 million tests . day yesterday 953,000 tests constantly criticized Obama golfing time repeatedly told voters would time play.. would never leave White House, promised, supporters clapped cheered, would busy working. golfed lot too, almost much.

Donald gone golfing twice much, half time. 

Obama visited golf clubs total 306 times 8 years president. 20% private clubs, 20% public, 60% military courses. 

Trump visited golf clubs 279 times counting,  100% golf time private clubs, keep media taking photos, keep money spent Secret Service food accommodations. article. Maybe become allergic outside world? Study said think 44-66% population infected. also said antibody wan couple months.

Its pre-print, fyi. mean countries also trying kill people mandating lockdowns? US deaths compared developed countries? Cause get test results faster news moment... guess /s So, seem saying (like many people sub)- follow science, certain science. 

Also, proof assertion fallacy- “It’s true it’s obviously true, despite data says.” [many countries reporting instances COVID-19 new study suggests acquired protective immunity novel coronavirus may last 12 months time. 

...so would last least one year.

That's fucking awesome. take flu shots year already (or should, least). 

Fucking clickbait BS. bad blinded guy hate crime Sweden protect far possible. actually public interest reason half measures applied far. 

The Swedish strategy theoretical best grossly incompetent considering human cost. Yes coronabarometer result 9/9.

They posted weekly coronabarometer source date get right one.

If wanted find article news paper id give name news paper date get right newspaper. skeptics complaining ""shifting goalposts"":

We could defeated coronavirus *APRIL* taken seriously. locked hard strong every U.S. city, kept borders closed virus left world. However, poor leadership, selfish individualistic attitude American people general made *impossible* happen.

Maybe time rethink means American. know, prevent future pandemics? mutual aid group city helping people utility rent payments. gave twenty skittles one poisonous... Official US military records dedicated [National WWII show 407,000 fatalities WWII. Also, widely accepted historians decades 618,000 American deaths Civil War. appears number may [higher previously also breaks [fatalities every war America involved point still stands, numbers aren’t entirely accurate. Kudos resisting pull contempt. Lol, said clickbait call proposed time-limited, regional restrictions ""lockdown"" Tegnells words ""shift no-lockdown strategy"", proposed tried - successful dont know, live Uppsala. Unfortunately DN's article behind paywall cannot read original interview, ""lockdown"" definitely wording ... put glass case museum belongs already? challenge study would allow millions helped trial proves effective. cares? Give us news safely passed testing, highly effective, ready go. speculation leads anxiety. ready ready. take engineer read fucking instruction manual comes air conditioner. stupid af dunno, Bill. billionaire buddies seem ""progressed"" quite nicely crisis. sound like poorly trained bot. Use paragraphs. Since mindset NYC geared towards, “Screw it, we’re opening schools”, rest nation open let chips fall may. society continually overlook nature offered us, beyond me. Amazing idiots call progress. literally said one infects immune system cells, new thing viruses do.

Its known phenomenon, big part spanish flu influenza strains.

The fact think covids trump card small percentage cases even require hospitalisation laughable.

I knew playing full deck cards started ranting conspiracy theories. really ignorant basics viruses function. Worse try act like know everything. knowledge subject could fit thimble. would missed scrolled bit article. would also assumed knuckle-dragging imbecile / COVID denier.

The article title (and title thread) specifically worded get effect. correlate said dumb shit like that? Silly troglodyte. ""2020 made lose empathy sick dying found actions negligent""? Yes, you. may assume care people dying locked state moved testing like every governor, aggressive lockdown/masking route.

But that's true him, would least conflict says (that deaths virus tragic combatted). openly saying feels good watch drown bodily fluids removes doubt what's heart mind. Indeed, svt website says ""We death among younger ones, before, comment death privacy reasons."". age group 0-9 years old. Sweden winning longer drags obvious becomes. news? what's worse environment, going Japan reason, going Japan climb mountain business trip? I'll await none answer shortly. article says 2500 schools buildings, 1600 schools NYC according mayor. course opened yet. proximity wealth makes inherently better people. Great theory, product american education system. That's source, that's date. 

I hope realize this, otherwise really speaking Swede. fighting infectious disease well decade now. must live rock. would even expect conduct study entire real-life population

Population scale studies conducted time plethora scientific disciplines. population entire nation, lot better two hair dressers things obvious don’t need specific study.

That's bold assertion, expertise within relevant fields? degree epidemiology, sociology suggesting thousands people breathe differently one person? 

Of course not, I'm saying obvious emergent properties might important go single individual population people. That's psychology different sociology, chemical hydrology (the study chemical properties water) different hydrometeorology (the study transfer water energy land, oceans there’s piece evidence handful articles, go google info you’re interested in.

You're making claim. want convince me, provide sources admit sound scientific basic claim. excuse someone admit robust foundation belief. problem likely will. he's back he'll empowered say fine. fair, attention-grabbing title article (and thread) relies people assuming crippling whole society / literally setting us back 25 years species, somehow.

And also yeah economy totally fucked, domino effect everything else. *just* economy. know else costs lives? 

Government mandated lockdowns. nothing artifact fact testing lower weekends. 7 day average useful metric here. 🤣 already earlier comment. 9/9 2 trillion pumped stock market. totally falsified perception everything fine. Wall Street illusion currently mirror Main Street all. enjoy process digging pool back yard fill right back dirt, pointless? enjoy process running giant circle daily?

Neither things produce emissions destroy home. Flying reason fly, is. students yet either. Also where's 2500 number coming from? Source? Womp womp Lol. enjoy random debating time time, yes. seemingly valid points, honestly feel like human nature dictates level shutdown always needed keep virus contained. Pressure politicians regular people false sense safety, anxious get economy going again. Studies show factor 1918.

It called Spanish Flu said originated Spain, people sure true anymore. supposedly came war soldiers overseas? intl flying infrastructure still functional enough even right now. Lots intl travel.

My viewpoint, way, someone lives epicenter. seen great difference proper masking distancing makes, quickly virus spikes society reopened soon, without proper precautions. important thing remember. Covid-19 automatic death sentence like people seem think is. 

The negative impact lockdowns much worse case covid would many people. Redditors get mad point Canada, general, successful country proximity US. really makes mad funny think why. school buildings open yet. still closed. I’m curious get 2500 school buildings mayors office says 1600 schools. Wikipedia says 1700. actually know political theatre, little anything new prorogued parliament 6 weeks try dodge funding scandal. already sacrificed Finance Minister (who major concerns deficits he's running).

Yes way better US, second think Trudeau squeaky clean. He's slimier average canadian politican says lot. lmao, guess also believe noone died COVID. many. Name one used, quote part fail understand. Reinfections happen 5 months naturally occuring infection. well said. Integrity ask (as bare minimum). wish able vote next president, really matters. Biden fuck things less hopefully. picking details. even said addition UBI VAT makes ""less regressive"". idea use enough UBI completely offset regressiveness VAT, turn de facto progressive tax, certain segment economy, consumption tax completely offset, plus that. go Pink Floyd, least good music.... Happy Cake Day! landing right back airport problem? realize people return place called home right? Breaks 2 legs suddenly make okay? death young person today? think heard Tegnell said something want comment further?

I acess computer right FHMs webbpage work well via mobile browser. America: land elect reality tv president action hero actually hero real life.  admitted 2012 wrong quickly something like would happend, Im reading correctly.

The issue dont know earth effected in: shit, Sherlock. 

We're desperate return degree normalcy we're combating stupidest anti-scientific rednecks world seen widespread media. energy shoved coming one specific scientific advancement (a vaccine) least *think* returning normal lives.

How would surprise something noteworthy anyone bit mystery me. shit we're back-tracked anything else, including scientific progress / advancement human species. Still ""best"" healthcare Americans can't afford Even Navy SEALS came him. Wondering many people infected first. like masks. There's nothing wrong taking L **coronabarometer** I'm opposite. may get stared constantly wearing gimp mask, Tesco can't throw anymore. Behind Ted Cruz, Rand Paul punchable fave Washington. he’s even licensed normal eye doctor licensing board. created whole separate “board” went Upstairs Hollywood Medical College. Nowhere post recommend skipping prenatal care, say fetal movement substitute regular prenatal checkups. Good heavens.

I’ll edit post clarify. every day, business, customers homes daily... He’s pretty good, Canada doesn’t better leaders lying wait something Syphigonnorheaids  also said “challenged” Paul’s claim New York achieved herd immunity, saying around 22% New York’s residents likely exposed coronavirus. Sixty 80% population needs vaccinated develop antibodies natural infection achieve herd immunity, top World Health Organization officials said. 

Everytime Fauci talks really model public servant served without prejudicial reasoning partisan posturing. 

It tells something Rand Paul got skin. Back Windows ME. doctor ignoring what’s happening ground Sweden. Sure mandate mask shutdowns anything else, speaking business contacts people voluntarily. Business closed people wear mask social distance. One contacts told someone doesn’t mask on, people politely ask wear one. claiming doesn’t take government orders achieve better results cherry picking information. He’s ignoring what’s happening ground studies showing wearing mask lowers viral load one exposed thus causing milder cases helping achieve herd immunity. 

He also ignoring large percent citizen trust government follow recommendations. USA tried we’d less mask cases deaths making economy worst here. 

He knows pushing agenda right keep elected. testing positive stupid. Wow, way generalize entire country 1.4 billion people. suppose white people must racist then. confirm assessment problem correct, conclusion pretty big logical leap. Free child care right. Kids responsibility parents, public. However, imo, service support lady child offered part universal healthcare system. Ultimately, public health issue. But, using public health issue advocate sort universal child care program pretty illogical. many, many good arguments subsidizing child care, one them. childcare center (that'd receiving subsidies) would equipped deal child COVID. mean, honestly, people power use state legislatures override vote, not? Personally, welcome incissently pleasant Canadian overlords. work nursing home people always making comments like “why can’t dad call work care kids sometimes instead.” Ummmm even (nursing management) “husband makes nearly twice someone’s gonna get fired ain’t gonna him” group... naturally CNAs, mostly women... 8th call sends possible termination. 3 kids isn’t lot call offs per kids. let’s pretend ever use sick time ourselves.  Damn that’s nutty. work grants us 80 hours sick leave tested positive covid. think think whole lot testing. Misinformation. Positives still infections whether they're they've passed infectiousness. Iran’s third wave? Shows herd immunity impossible current rate infection. Testing capacity NL limited due corruption uwu Since animals get covid bet dogs dropping like flies. get pulse oximeter easily cheaply, ask humor periodically clamping finger checking readings. get low, perhaps seeing raw numbers spark something seek care. 

He probably get tested, ultimately won't, can't force him. That’s one symptoms have. Things definitely tasted lot differently, partially sense taste smell taken thing overwhelming everything else. mean company received 30 million dollars seed money Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority US DEPARTMENT DEFENSE? one? millions money? preventing 3rd wave though, sending everyone school ensuring 2nd wave never ends. Sir, McDonald’s Well actually missed multiple words ceracnting comment. left wing way responding I'm surprised. Zlatan needs challenge. Lol 😂 downside text - one hear tone Hey everyone, I""m supposed go wedding New York 3 weeks (I'm VA). rules protocol need aware of? driving day staying aunt's (empty) house family spends night MIL. need fill forms self quarantine anything like that? Could C Diff? see typo. Thanks closed three weeks. Open back weeks, cases jump up, close back down..... must mean he's homosexual. That's thing think there, ya? r/lewronggeneration Netherlands breaking record 5th day row, great. Btw, test less half European countries,thanks corruption covid handling crisis response group Everyone see wearing one. far worse that. beat crap Vietnamese men, tree branch, said bunch racist things. never addressed 1st wave. Trump pretended serious bit got bored moved next thing interested him.

That's gets pissy reporters ask questions. Like can't understand people still talk covid he's moved on. Adderall? He's asymptomatic 
He's assholematic
He's Covid-19

Please read tune Greased Lightning. Okay answer simple questions. keep repeating version ""if imagine worst possible motivations someone else, okay wish death upon them"". “Guys let’s put everyone commits wrong think “national registry” ahhahaa would awesome epic reddit moment!!!”

“What? mean that’s authoritarian? SHUT UP” Let's recognize something basic - concept ""herd immunity"" work unless willing incur whole lot avoidable deaths. met one. also scraps mold food gone bad eats ""good parts"". Yeah, maybe. don’t know I’d ever get connected help yeah like speak bit louder. hard understanding purpose mask, people blindly follow rules randomly hate everything new. school restaurant grocery store workplace..... 

Seriously, would excellent strategy add mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing. like weird flutter chest couple months afterwards. wasn’t sure anxiety, lung issue, heart?? I’m American unfortunately healthcare system trained avoid costs, else I’ll truly pay price (it’s cheaper die point). But, now, 5 months feel ok. 

I read somewhere severity virus changing depending symptoms have. apparently lot less severe mostly gastro issues. Almost sounds like method! numbers felt similar look article days ago: 31 41 bus passengers Norway got infected trip somewhere.

Not relevant anyway, similar numbers thought one least. Interesting 75% cases. real question Mark Wahlberg horde 1.3 million face masks? way going near Mitch. humid places like Florida, Alabama, Georgia, etc. cannot easily bring humid outdoor air simply open windows (which sealed lot newer buildings per energy efficiency guidelines). 

You’d replace systems sort system you’d find hospital. Prohibitively expensive. 

So lot places nothing. That’s also unacceptable. 

 HVAC air expert, really idea.. would look like get *portable* air purifying machines classrooms? know we’d like permanent changes future pandemics, doesn’t seem realistic, particularly south. Nope Yes. Sometimes believe backfires. Without names criminals paper, people start speculating, always assume they're migrants, blacks whatever type people like. case understandable. need know every detail child his/her family enough problems right now. Spent couple weekends Savannah/Tybee Ft Walton Beach. MAYBE 10% people masks. employees forced wear weren’t covering nose. People bars meeting new people shaking hands. Lots good immunity created there. Much enjoyable personalities Atlanta. countries creating different vaccines, ones proven effective (let's say, Johnson &amp; Johnson one looks hopeful, Oxford one) get licensed countries. formulas, nonetheless relatively collaborative effort. 

And yeah, one expected approved early next year. yes, people like never going ultimately get it. True! meant someone doesnt wear mask testing positive isnt noteworthy surprising anyone. hardly news. Give corona pet good boy. they’re way herd immunity, right? Something letting cases go widespread seems make virus evolve less deadly. maybe places testing severe cases CoVID patients look worse American data. Probably also includes maintenance administrative facilities. making declaration “COVID articles” based single article removed doubt moron. kids cannot get pass it! 

/s I'd love know percentage ~7miilion US citizens fucked ability smell taste now. Happened best friends caught COVID work June. Things still smell/taste ""right"" them. forgot biggest bar virus first second infections sequenced show different sequences. way telling right true reinfection would able detect whether person reinfected strain virus. state fair  want anyone else die this, agree. wish probability people like experiencing serious enough symptoms change heart. many people thoroughly convinced harmless, NOTHING personal experience disease worst likely completely change minds, one hopes seeing experience others ""trust"" rough go might whittle away opposition. Well shit, test?

Seriously train enough dogs this? don’t see not. 

Instant results sound great  Closed schools threatening parents’ livelihoods. It’s easy pass moral judgment don’t worry making rent/mortgage payments putting food table. It’s common shutdown-schools-forever crowd retort government pay parents stay home, nothing like ever table clearly forthcoming. never expect people accept personal economic hardship greater good without compensation — it’s reason bar comedy club owners keep agitating full reopening. Everyone’s gotten message it’s Thunderdome, parents teachers pitted other.

Teachers understandably concerned personal safety, tend reject idea responsibilities include childcare. want ride pandemic behind laptop screen income disruption like white-collar corporate peers. don’t go class, many parents can’t work, kids go hungry, kids get trapped abusive households. Also, kids getting barely real instruction it’s clear remote education doesn’t work younger kids.

This dilemma without solution, you’re going keep reading headlines persists. thought weren’t able smell covid  referring CDC guidelines (in place since March) determining contract tracing obligations. Big idiot move, guess. anything stop would required plan. It’s late now. We’re fucked. Let's hope let go ahead larger study, sounds almost good true really? percentage US state governors make? 4%? 6%? Kind makes official numbers suspect. 50 small sample set still suspect.  never said fucked big time. experts Bojo clique? Trump? know reddit nobody read article, Governor Mike Parson ""only"" vehemently opposes *mask mandates*, masks themselves. He's ""urging"" residents wear masks public, also vocally opposes government forcing people wear them.

I vehemently disagree him, let's spread lies thinks virus hoax. Yeah I’m sure enough results end year FDA grant EUA. laughed way hard this. short - no, least, **very** unlikely (bordering impossible). virus needs time gain foothold host start infecting others, time pretty much never 12-15 hours exposure. 

It generally thought contagious 48 hours symptoms appear, median time symptom appearance (if happens), 5 days exposure. would people interacts 2-3 days brunch would risk infection, you. 

That said, someone going rave middle pandemic probably following stringent distancing masking guidelines rest life, I'd cautious interactions guy moving forward, now. No. Specialty board organizations non-governmental entities many medical fields shifted core principal ensuring members meet certain level competence extracting much money members possible. number specialties made boards protest. Great TLDR article. LOL. reddit people ask science ""oh God, come x, horrible people"" thing Even Dr. Fauci said vaccine 50% effective. Build herd immunity using healthy people like Sweden start living again. virus going anywhere. Nice syntax. Dear edmc2. friend could sick him/herself short time frame. However, he/she might still carried live virus particles clothing/hair/body shower change clothes. Otherwise fine. 

(It would prudent self-isolate though, least keep distance people friend tests negative week 2 weeks.) Who'd thunk Ahh, fun! 

Do stretches, clenched tight gonna snap. 

Good luck assume masks? say ""common sense suggests"" ? Everybody knew knowing staying home school doesn’t get rid virus penalizes life choice obvious. anyone think wouldn’t happen? don’t understand. want bring post down, governor state known flat-face lie get famous (I'm brasilian). would take article 1 kg salt. USA leadership done anything get prevent ""2nd wave"" fall? Rest Peace. listened young dumb? Yeah sure, gonna typical reddit thing pretend like dumb selfish young normal you’ve exposed tell let make decisions. guess he's virtually nobody. Conservatism morals. election long, hard winter think attitude towards vaccines change lot people desperate injected anything might work. point hopefully something kinda works! feel like I've read observations again. headline catches people's attention, always story: viruses mutate time, type virus much less so. mutations tend towards making virus less deadly easy spread. No, there's still immediate concern invalidating vaccine efforts. time. Good Dr. Fauci. back press conferences instead doctor around. Like Herman Cain? He's still fighting mask mandates died it. virus survive outdoors far longer low temperatures sterilizing UV reaching ground northern hemisphere winters. think outdoor spread may greatly underestimated.

That case, Iceland ought 'canary coalmine'. Check daily cases Iceland graph here, get idea what's Sorry Mrs Baggins!! general statement. case understandable. order officially declare someone recovered, need test people twice more. two tests would better employed testing people might disease. consider counting recoveries waste time agree. will? Probably never. changed mind even test capacity improved greatly. Bonus question: make difference? opinion, no, certainly live without information Well ends ventilator plenty time pray comments question published makes moron. Haha funny! consistent say social distancing mask wearing reduce transmission, R0 still ~3 60-70% population needed herd much US appears well 3 we’re reducing transmission careful behaviors. much US, R0 appears ~1.2 (we’ve reduced transmission immunity defined 1 - 1/R0, 20% enough.


You making fundamental error. people talk herd immunity, generally talking rate needed long keep businesses shut down, masks lot, work home, limit size gatherings, constant testing/tracing, etc on. that's suggesting comment/numbers.  way you, even mention Olympics No, they’re uncomfortable, grow up. Sure, fucking flying across globe willy nilly, also fault too.

Governments corporations deserve held accountable, individual travelers need understand conduct contributing issue.

I mean, flight nowhere happen people signing thought would behave completely differently. Incidentally, *this due tiny detail surface protein virus.* 

Not interviewer: ""Go on!!"" agree, state federal government come options opening Schools. could done stimulus gor parents, offered incentives employers accommodating, instead things like throw $3M kanye west shoe company keep people place without truly requiring evidence needed business actual kept people employed. area mega churches recieved money program business. That’s inaccurate information, stop lecturing others education in.  skepticism healthy, please clarify youre suggesting. science wrong, reject science? know buildings could get Covid-19. Unfortunately, yes. New cases pretty much useless metric point. whole ""just wait two weeks"" narrative fly capitalist wealth soars... go airport covid, get mauled? Japan undercounting cases deaths anyone developed world, also paying foreign press publish puff pieces completely inaccurate concepts like data scientists contact tracers (or hygiene levels) Japan done well. black box caused harm people lack transparency, one gets little scrutiny beyond borders (none within). think study changes this.

People talk Sweden day, Sweden's mystery. less know what's happened there.

I'd say Japan Pakistan (maybe Africa) two real mysteries. Japan's case, testing low even compared developing nations. Also, many people assume technology capabilities means they've done something particular fight virus (they haven't). So, definitely neglected top 5 COVID story. think going change.

Either way, study blowing casedemic spheres Twitter right now. going get lot attention. Hard measure Looking past history, maybe Bikini Atoll? fully support dogs healthcare literally every industry think means ""not working"" Latin. nothing getting people vaccine Trump care that. wants say vaccine exists start rolling out, point say ""See, covid's going disappear like said"".

This man already injected political bullshit throughout FDA CDC done bypass recommendations. best interests overall push vaccine that's ready, necessarily best interest people who's jobs finances line. Nah, remember words giving little short time get back track. Comfortable lies. trust anymore. i'm right ya, plandemic another seasonal flu media milking spread fear, confusion worst all; isolation. I'm amazed many people buy news article posted tell youngsters live life 50%. f\*\*k? bad idea young person isolate yourself, cut exercise, basically practice social distancing someone know tells so. people really touch? everyone saying dogs could get covid, suppose could possible, definitive data, let's look numbers. number covid cases worldwide 31 million. 470 million pet dogs world. overlap people virus also around family dog dogs must huge! Maybe someone else math, I'm good thinking numbers, feel like millions millions dogs exposure covid reported covid-related illness. heard 30% asymptomatic Coronavirus, 80% less 30% 80% leaves 56% population get Coronavirus (and kind illness ranging mild death) herd immunity achieved.

That's works asymptomatic people still spread disease. 

Remember, herd immunity spread, severity. means point virus spreading uninfected people get it. can't subtract asymptomatic people still spread it. know people laughing this, valid science behind lots anecdotal evidence. Ancient Greece, idea scent used diagnose various illness. personal experience, issue hands smelling like rotting peaches. constantly washing them, avail. Within months start this, diagnosed fast growing cancer. Within two days cancerous tumors removal, scent went away. know anecdotal experience, method used eons. Show anti-maskers claim Sweden’s soft response best option Swedish CDC refusing, kicking screaming, recommend proven measures mask use. could deny evidence anymore, said ""maybe masks work, adventure positive trend. Using evidence based treatments could give people false sense security"".

And trend worsens. one surprised. new excuse be? FSU credibility. work AIDS terrible. adults going stupid nightclubs.... blaming regular people traveling, governments corporations held accountable. like Exxon others want true, one Dakotas used money advertising - remember one, whichever one she-demon governor. Possibly yes, time frame stays same. No, gave 2014-2015 working Ebola vaccine. would 4 decades prior vaccine relevant? Ah, see opposed Democracy Authoritarianism, thought referred Electoral College *as* Authoritarianism above. Democracy problem. Democracy works. Authoritarianism, alternative democracy, work.

You'll see refer ""US democracy"", ""democracy"". I'm arguing *US* democracy work, plenty kind democratic systems work better.

Also, way wide range existing democratic systems, also wide range authoritarian systems (think Singapore). black white issue, lot shade grey.

I thus disagree statement ""authoritarianism, alternative democracy, work"". *Both* democratic authoritarian systems work *specific* conditions, believe US system one (even without EC). Kinda reminds sniffer Ks World War Z need permanent pandemic response department. 

I thought supposed be-our WORLD pandemic response? guess works countries agree response plan follow response plan. would total transparency cooperation amongst countries realistic. China want agency come real time release genotype months. China could Russia, US etc. Global cooperation way prevent pandemic.   Im saying 2 approaches (lock down, lockdown) unfortunately countries chose no-lockdown approach. 
And lockdown approach seem work (with always present human errors complications ) it’s choose follow path (with partially catastrophic results despite lockdowns) learn approach. goes directions. always condemn Sweden approaching herd immunity ? 
Why trying learn ? I'll take alive difficulty breathing and/or exhaustion dead. I'm sure 99%+ people would say thing. Dogs win  Social media conspiracy theories made lot people numb. downfall. Technology downfall. free, nowhere near instant. usually takes days week get results. Lol, understanding nothing this. number die along way. likely eventually older, risk people wind catching it

If someone could quantify risk, substantiate actual outcomes, may move us past one side says dangerous side saying big deal. people ignorant, selfish assholes, that’s answer. Masking distancing still need thing probably two years so. intention giving masking public ever again, allergies asthma vastly improved it. number people start taking serious? live exurb, every school county cases limited number students far even person learning. least one teacher every School, know of. contact tracing bull shit. tell someone person 15 minutes close contact without mask. Relying symptoms diagnose means putting people higher risk allowing spread. McConnell doesn’t work enough that. pandemic ends herd immunity. Naturally induced, likely much faster vaccine induced. people affect speed vaccine development deployment way clarify, I’m Canada concerned possible invasion act aggression... US military itself, far-right emboldened cause trouble. know isn’t exactly rational reaction, irrational times. 

My partner also suggested leaving country. born another Commonwealth country don’t know could join easily landed immigrant. Consider schools universities open, students must attend, majority low-wage retail/service jobs done young people, rather issue entirely based entitlement. said would take two years fight beginning this. Ok explains low reading. now? Still coughing? Pray tell, would done? beautifully despair think correct comes feeding child someone else feeding child, I’d absolutely pick child every single time. Unfortunate reality situation. Airports lots parking, public transportation access (well, sometimes, also less convenient taking different bus walking 20 minutes, *cough* YYJ *cough*) already experienced directing lines people existing screening areas! fleet dogs good band name even read article? image “1. Masks Capture Coronavirus Particles” taken Business Insider. author made point dispute this.

Here quotes article:

“ 3M industrial filters able capture 95% particles 0.007 micron. Given news outlets claimed surgical masks can’t capture nanoparticles, it’s particularly surprising surgical mask able capture 80% tiny particles.”

This one, above, referring smoke particles smaller coronavirus particles...

Here’s another quote, (remember, article!!!!!!) response study shot actual virus particles mask.

“Even poorly performing masks captured 90% viruses. researchers chose two N95 masks scored poorly earlier study, yet even poor-performers still blocked 94% particles heaviest air flow rate.

Conclusion: Masks – including surgical masks N95 masks – capture viruses even particles 10 times smaller.” And, lot stinkier, waste by-product decay much quickly. “I Italy took balloon ass Spain.” Worth  question hope someone might able help me:

Today tooth removed dentist prescribed antibiotic (pennicilin+clavulanic acid). issue is, today sister also arriving plane country highly affected Covid-19 (and we'll living house).

I 31 normally serious case catch Covid-19, however heard antibiotics negative effect immune system I'm afraid somehow sister ends bringing Covid gift rather serious case since symptoms would start days antibiotic taken.

I currently wondering whether postpone taking antibiotic taking risk sister. Says Bill safety secluded island True, side effects mild. Pain injection site, mild fever/fatigue. Exactly question. prepared reasonable chance getting it... disease go right nose infect them? Hi all, 
I read text post local Facebook group wondering accurate dont know much virus. wondering someone filter misinformation. TIA

post follows: 


On masks: sense sensibilities 

There’s plenty discourse masks especially Glastonbury highstreet mainly shouted people smell see, people. can't read. message sensible analytical people found anti-mask anyone still complains (even internally) everytime get bus go tesco. difficult us inconvenience abstract old person may died anyway. We'd like care, like think care enough us make semi-permanent lifestyle changes. lets totally selfish moment think masks might help us individuals. see death count percentage population makes look surface less like pandemic like colossal reaction. usual dead worry, viral infections come dizzying varieties initial infection lead complications line, example, consider chicken pox initial infection, feel little itchy little achy week, good go. except really you, virus sit nervous system years years one day BAM! shingles, recovery period 4 times longer far severe skin problems often lethargy excess. later complications staple feature viral infections heavily correlated initial viral load.

what means us (Relatively) unknown virus could years decades full extent damage known (or COULD fine everyone get better) , large number people reporting symptoms going away recovering. minor still missing sense smell major chronic fatigue (ME) scary Neurological conditions.

my point implications virus almost entirely unknowable especially idiots like basically medical knowledge begin with, also people actually work medicine biology. unless extra info seems like limiting viral load going greatly increase chance symptomless case much lower chance Complications later on.

There i'd like call tendency looking terms recent events think word nowhere near strong enough describe people's pathological need never change mind, remain consistent literally killing people, dont let socio-political hang-ups get way good old fashioned informed decision making, let go righteous indignation blinds effectively plucking eyes out. anything else BELIEFS CHILDREN experts virology, going wrong going make mistakes clinging mistake still much mistake.

We dont know whats gonna happen yet Lads, safe sorry yeah?

TL:DR

\- death possibly even worse symptom Covid

\- dont lick people chickenpox

\-wear mask, even thin scarf going reduce amount potential virus come contact with

\-just cus already decided opinion mean exempt possibility correct one

\-Being wrong offend sensibilities. Calvin Klein? meh mean...*our response* what’s erased years progress Well like lied. evolving, technically truth majority side effects listed pain injection site, fatigue/moderate fever. true Interesting! I’ve got Dr. appointment coming up, I’ll find out! 

Definitely wish gotten tested time, Dr. local urgent care kind talked it. shaddup , are. Look Africa, Ethiopia launched rocket launch FIRST satellite thanks China. WTF Anglos done Africa last century? 

[Akon: Country World Done Good Africa NOBODY WANTS LOGIC REASONING! WANT DOGGIES! GET OUT! Ask elsewhere Leadership showing way.... really man's best friend. Oh well that's cool! original comment people general. Again, know much him. Presidential election US.

There's lot line.  best masks able block entering system; could lesser ones? mention particles stick clothes, hands, mask, everything, even mask blocks 100%, still exposed. Unless prefer prisoner sit home watching media milk f\*\*\* plandemic... Well, sometimes side effects get seen larger scale study done. Also, need know efficacy first. 99 percent safe, 2 percent effective point mass production it. Exactly, understand difficult parents kid sick take work, sending school sick guaranteeing put several people situation. You’re right. Thanks correction. I'd like understand rationale here. would ""push"" vaccine election, even wanted to? maybe Pfizer vaccine get EUA approval like month now. amount to? Basically nothing, right? That's week E-day, forget 99% joe schmoes sub getting right election day. who, realistically, saying ""my vote determined there's EUA vaccine election day"" remember, vax given elderly infirm first, take multiple months able get vaccinated major areas around USA. understand concerned vaccine pushed know big pharma reviewers FDA way much lose pushing vaccine work safe simp prez. Imagine pharma company releases vaccine work harmful people. putting ""trust"" them, FDA reviewer's best interest put something works. Plus either way take early next year doses get general public, issues put absolute BLAST reach average working age middle-lower class joe (who health workers). prez lab making vaccine himself. 

Help understand? simply learn code  I’ve flown US twice last two months. literally prescreening COVID questions symptoms. also don’t allow N95 masks anymore “vents filters” bullshit. KN95 best wear. mass destruction native species habitats, low control/hygiene pens farms, saturation antibiotics farm animals, said farms built near habitats. us alone preventable stopped minute demand proper control group. Dogs lab coats, nobody knows trained except covid screeners. one saying is. point? seem uncomfortable idea college students president wrong time. Why? life-form smarmy slimy Rand Paul?

Outside something might find deep-sea vent crevice, doubt it. Nothing ~~medical~~ free ~~in godforsaken country~~ God must hurt dumb confident. Ben Carson longer taste message. Imagine living country worse recreational drugs life-threatening illness. disproving something said.


You claimed women taken seriously. (""The outreach women"") not.


Men issues, say men worse women comes taken seriously healthcare *laughably* wrong. men's issue hiding emotions realize something wrong, said. case, aren’t factor go into? really promoting testing, high volume areas practical test everyone every day like schools. dogs checking virus pull kids verification test.

I'm US far heard testing still sucks. enough, long results, false positives negatives, etc. could help bridge gap make feasible return activity lower risk, I'm it. Actually definitely CFR. - Herman Canine add California list compare deaths NY think referring Cuomo's colossal mistake sending sick old people back nursing homes rather figuring way quarantine them. dog quarantine positive sniff? sturgis held Boulder?

No?

Then point Boulder? guess, fuck doesnt matter, still spread it. impact opening schools colleges presents pretty much fact. agree assessment well.

Datawise, men taken seriously women actually go doctors. issue men often go doctors ingrained sexism. 🙏😌🙏 Really? close proximity one another opening mouths pushing air every second ... really need scientist tell spread airborne virus?  dog gets COVID? completely lose sense smell like humans? I'm guessing they're smelling virus itself, they're probably smelling aggregate set changes body that's infected. going work getting potentially exposed fine. Daring see friends work something fun wrong.

All work play...  start vulnerable populations behaving misbehaving population?

Did even think asking nonsense? Harris County test positivity rate absolute case count went county mask mandate. thing happened Bexar County.

What consistent cases decline approximately 2% population testing positive via PCR. That's true every major outbreak far US.

California's cases exploded mask mandate. reduction transmission correlated mask use.

You're wrong, wrong point reasonable person would conclude stumbled wrong conversation. still rank top using methods everywhere, ridiculous given amount spend nationally healthcare That’s whole thread entirety sub is.. Ron Paul stupid? always respected even voted primary 2008, although 18 best grasp politics. paid attention since relevant since then. done right, totally scalable. Better letting people die. Better closing PLANET again. 100%, embarrassing train many dogs possible, right now. see. Health officials Cali/LA monitoring thing. I'm r/menslib personally. 

I reject hypothesis. Look, ""act tough"" thing mentioned killing men blame men **victim blaming**. mom told appear tough, too. online dates expected tough assertive, too. TV trains tough. ignore society ""other men"" focus father professional communicator instead being""tough"". no. reject hypothesis men sole source toxic masculinity. society large including women. know spike happened can't say BLM COVID proof.

NH low numbers border businesses always full people Massachusetts like paying taxes Massachusetts. Restaurants full people Massachusetts know I'm one people. 

Hospitals supposed implode two weeks never happened like two weeks see scary numbers hospitals wont. Nobody pointing fact almost young covid patients asymptomatic wont fear factor.

Here NH numbers might no, thank you, cyanide though thats data obtained past 6 months shown time time again?

Or ignore facts scary enough? don’t care forced put kids schools system failed help working class parents yet again? cocaine minus asshole smell. Things hyped pan out, see signs shit goin media saying big deal, time stock politician advocates unsafe policies harm people, getting sick following idiocy, yeah can't surprised gets attention. People also wonder sick person get, well known cases mild. antimasker politician getting mild case probably cements position, unfortunately. Let reword said:

""Aside concentration camp things (forced sterilization, separation children parents, rape, unchecked covid without treatment, etc.), what's concentration camp like migrant camps?""

It composes targeted minority group Trump repeatedly compared vermints (sound similar someone else Jews?)

I mean like Trump administration performing great. Look @ recent Hague report condemning Trump sanctioning International Criminal Organizations, Faith-Based Groups, Legal Professionals, Experts, Former Government Officials Unequivocally Oppose U.S. Sanctions International Criminal that? Criminals violating international standards human ICC represents constitutes part global system international justice United States chief architect Nuremberg beyond. Today, ICC, alongside tribunals, regional mechanisms, national courts, carrying forward efforts investigations prosecutions could help realize justice atrocity victims Sudan Myanmar. court last resort, ICC intervene State demonstrated unwillingness inability hold nationals account crimes within Court’s jurisdiction. ICC therefore provides essential backstop victims recourse justice. use sanctions potential wide-reaching impact institution dedicated advancing justice victims.

Convenient Trump, running concentration camps, sanctioning International watchdog body, eh? Hitler-esque Yeah looking data matter, that's sure. agree societal expectations force men pretend everything ok health not, problem healthcare system. shocked tell you. Shocked!  Exactly. Malarone, HCQ, prescribed traveling malaria-prone areas. Hello? ""close""? ""close"" science. ""Close"" put men moon. answer no. Hello? Yet are... Let’s put like this: Denmark tests four times much Sweden. Sweden positive rate double Denmark. 

Denmark catch cases Sweden, doubt, registered cases Denmark closer truth ones Sweden. 

But cannot extrapolate linear fashion. 

Hospital admissions deaths much better indication spread, albeit lagging weeks. Symptoms (step 3) would drive back health care. time come clean (ie, ""confess"").  --Or even *remember*: see someone shrugging symptoms time, they're mild, realize later ""oh, beginning"". agree case hospital delay all. sick enough need test go get one start feel sick, likely least couple days longer. Turn around time still crap, still 5-7 days longer. day 5-7 likely point needing hospital care need days later. likely going need hospital day 21 so. Hospitals report every single day lag there. 

If want say lag deaths, sure, hospitalized lag severe even exists all. Also, folks even get tested already hospital. Sadly even hospitalized good metric local big hospital network tests everyone admitted cause. test positive give birth counted hospitalized COVID. think know vaccine effective, much faster efficient way. Right giving people vaccine letting go daily routine happen contract virus, don’t know that’s vaccine worked possibly didn’t come contact someone infected. challenge trial participant given vaccine deliberately exposed virus. There’s proof virus created lab even was, evidence destroyed.

Blaming CCP virus doesn’t bode well anyone. Therefore must accept virus originated Mother Nature. Dr. Fauci said vaccine 50% effective.

You know one, even Fauci knows efficacy vaccines yet right? 50% figure **minimum** required approval FDA. Shit. People used news 40 times try say contagious less deadly ""new reports""..  little lost people know knew march strain impacted Italy hard warned coming last year... fuck dogs smell Covid? anything can’t do???? Problem fly another country first coming here. vice versa idiots trying go there. positivity rate state doubled since schools opened, even winter yet. think article wishcasting. Spoken like someone who’s never eaten grass whataboutism appreciated. 

Yes women face issues taken seriously doctor's office venue. #allhealthcarematters topic. Well past health scares related animals eat/farm. Pigs cows sheep going China animal market bats gets blamed Covid-19. humans definitely mitigate disease transmitted animals humans regulating meat industry limiting antibiotics used curbing amount meat humans eat general. It’s trying stop college age people getting together. Yes, it’s tough thing enforce effect simply put there. people age gather together free maybe getting trouble. walk ""men's rights"" sub? Women get harassed things, that's called employed USA.

The cultural thing men especially change. work mostly men expect ""act tough"" pretend fine (a woman) change tune talking another man. ""tough"" thing expectation made men men. Downvote fuck reddit! subreddit loves riots protests, hates people go exercise! Everybody loves sitting dark room day telling people ""dump"" girlfriends going grocery store sitting home longer! love ""dumping"" people here. dad goes store. ""Why dump him?"" Reddit hates people type family relationship! Dump them! dump them? true. agree reply comment.

the internet mistake find disturbing people *happy* Sweden getting rising cases. Probably dab 'Look Sweden' types.

Almost feels like sub devolved us vs polarisation bad things happening 'bad' ones ok either justifies viewpoint allows people express malice. Make sense sure, actually happen... refer previous list likely things. strongly disagree. headline headline ""we vaccine! end pandemic cite! operation warp speed vaccine gets approved!""

but guess we'll agree disagree this. dogs certain breeds. much better others regard. Short haired shedding dogs kill me, non shedding Terrier mix impact unless bring pollen outside. Also Airedale that, issues. Miss Airedale. No, would know areas need frequent cleaning.  point taken. aside family separation exposes unwanted medical procedures, see would different migrant camps erected European, North African, Arab nations back Syrian Refugee Crisis. 

Is concentration camp conditions worse? know migrant crisis southern border 2015 2017, right? I'm trying understand different standards here. want people take seriously, apply standards uniformity. thought point outbreaks general population. Italy, New York, Wuhan, Spain. really like trudeau government done fine job handling covid far know. want see blubbering fool look Ontario's premier. Didn’t realize bad. cases, along deaths, rising pretty fast. look actual data.

56% deaths 75 30% 85.

78 rough number group things around 80. real choice. Parents send children back going cause schools shut go back virtual, except instead pre-planned virtual going chaotic mess slapped together emergency response. going mean lot experienced teachers equation - resigned quit fear plus get sick die.  So, chaotic un-planned virtual run subs recent hires. It’s said trust broken child learns taught correct false almost irreparable. cosy companion butt? Another interesting factoid buried source article: 93% doctors surveyed expect 2nd wave winter. work claims screening temperature scans. shoot laser reads 92 F every time say that’s good. Eh, ""the media"" mixed bag...

It's media overplayed hyped dozens outbreak scares led boy cried wolf scenario we've seen unfold year. purposes testing besides one choose address, like example gave second paragraph, chose address. excusing bad faith covid deniers, identified ignored. 

For detecting might transmit virus others, case less-sensitive test might use cheaper, faster, and/or easily distributable.

More information Unfortunately test false positives find well, one likes talk prevelance goes low false positives floor keep at. 99.5% specificity, pretty good, 10,000 tests 0 true positives, would report 50 positives. know many places rerun positives slow lab turn around time still issue doubt do. suspect sports leagues rerunning every positive unless 100% specific test. absolutely worry! That's read post. like: Everybody worry! Bye bye guvna! Russian vaccine Oxford? missing third option?

Edit: apparently China vaccine testing Brazilians people. seem right.

I appreciate help chart explicitly say that? see multiple disparate numerical trends. contrast, others seem show lower rate like 65 already children's hospitals senior homes, little controlled, roaming. total lockdown possible 
1. Federal government cannot really order that, state governments handle within boundaries laws 
2. would utterly finish notion society country. would result utter complete economic devastation, loss USD world's reserve currency think summer shitstorm, would worse ten fold. article summarize agree Trump's lies conspiracies Trump. reject science agree Trump.

Wait sounds like severe political BS? Yes, that's article.  700k cardiovascular, 600k cancer deaths every year US. Covid top cause death US year. really matter even dictatorship builds AI. Solving worlds problems solving worlds problems. Human greed make sure dictators improve themselves, they've done hopefully they'll smart evil? Damn it!

\- r/coronavirus 65 chances dying extreme. virus, yes know can’t get again. Covid new. two breaks covid past twenty years time virus reinfect. seen 4 people USA get reinfected? millions. Scientists would look dismiss statistical insignificant. 

This talking about. repeating stuff heard news. flu completely different virus already know that. Scientist incredibly sure need single vaccine virus. one talking mutating like flu. 

As deaths per population, look numbers assume bad USA = bad? better Spain, barely worse Italy, etc. numbers seem bad due large population. 

The virus deadly unless 70-75. account almost 70+ percent deaths. catch covid age range, chances dying close .02percent. doesn’t factor fact getting also hard following rules won't. Cub Scout come fever headache told it’ll 5-7 days find it’s COVID-19. it’s everywhere. know, idiots roam free. jump Texas official numbers either: 


If better source interested. That’s plan. create pro-business laws, matter recklessly, collect donors. , assign blame case case basis. It’s government’ fault people got infect, it’s specific businesses infections occurred, individuals there. 

If Jaws, would like Mayor pinning shark attacks solely people bit. mad pointing we've failed. suggesting continuing fail prolong crisis. like say ""I've done part I'm done now"" that's works. makes much sense.

*Trump runs concentration camps

You come saying ""it can't concentration camps UN intervening"".

* Trump sanctioned ICC UN org that's supposed intervene.

You: ""HOW International Tribunal shall power prosecute persons responsible following crimes committed armed conflict, whether international internal character, directed civilian murder;(b) extermination;(c) enslavement;(d) deportation;(e) imprisonment;(f) torture;(g) rape;(h) persecutions political, racial religious grounds;(i) inhumane acts.""

Trump's camps fit a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i!

You: ""But never able compare trump's crimes humanity worse Syria's!!!!!!""

It's obvious arguing good faith lol test early July never got results for. call, posted online portal. Nothing. Cancer heart disease kill every year. warrants covid’s attention spreads quickly. number one cause death world year, far. 

18 million die cardiovascular disease every year, 10 million cancer. beat Vietnamese man young he's scum. Then, decade later, petitioned pardon; he's scum. again, point linking ICC homepage - organization made single statement regarding US refugee camps? Answers, obfuscations. Right. People like think die ""not strong enough"" ""god's plan"" wave away. worst form Rapture. AFAIK, bald cats quite literally cozy companions ancient rulers' arms resided wide-ass sleeves. like cultural differences role im sure.

of course, I'm NYC everyone wears masks even outside, know risk transmission low outdoors. places would different. general, seems like masks avoiding large crowds appreciable effect large cities across ""the west"" meant sarcasm...ooops...sorry friend, bad. Dogs sniff skin cancer detectable. One thing saw, put small number cells person doggo found it. Approaches unbelievable. Aaahh.....A scenic flight. 

Can still order wine/cocktails flights? need dogs large area, like airport, people willing drive testing.

IF dogs deployed ATL airport I'll seriously consider driving there, seeing dog, driving home test. airport 1 hour drive, test instant require swab shoved nose. Plus, dog!

Option 1: 1hr drive, dog sniff test, answer immediately
Option 2: 5min drive CVS, wait line, swab hell brain, wait week answer. If, Chinese Phase IIIs results better US sourced vaccine I'd happily take Chinese vaccine. rest US population, low expectations, believe strong overlap anti-vaxxx anti-china populations, lot less people would willing take Chinese vaccine. Yes. ideal cruelty. long portion suffer die wrong ingroup, deaths celebrated. silly, fear-mongering title. wanna focus throwaway comment, still keep dodging answer re: Syrian Refugee camps, it. 

The fact trying hard avoid answering question telling how? understand challenge trial entails. know takes extra time set manage manufacture live virus doses lab. 

I don’t see saves time use macaque non human primates already effectiveness. Shocking? No. Stupid, short-sighted dangerous? Yes. 

The way pandemic brought control combination approaches including social distancing, wearing face covering, hand-washing, etc and, eventually, vaccine, prophylaxis, treatments. Going spreading virus make drag longer. “Herd immunity” *eventually* arise years. 

Curb biological impulses year two, could past this. keep going mingling pre-pandemic style make things worse, longer.  case, Apollo 11 missed landing site four miles, Walter, picked really bad example! **Professor Drosten, Professor Ganten, biggest surprise regard COVID-19?**
 
CHRISTIAN DROSTEN: expect virus easily transmitted. quickly became clear SARS virus, specifically species, type virus I've known 17 years. thought would behave completely differently. Incidentally, due tiny detail surface protein virus.
 
DETLEV GANTEN: biggest surprise right beginning, virus still far away. Suddenly rapid spread started - isolated cases clusters. would thought virus would spread quickly systems overwhelmed catastrophic consequences. all, severe flu waves, controllable.
 
**What important thing fight COVID 19?**
 
GANTEN: Clearly: transparency, cooperation, communication and: education! crucial population well clearly informed precautionary measures understood followed myths spread. ""Education best vaccination"" - Education best vaccination. educated society deal better things, including false reports. think educational infrastructures Germany unmodern huge disaster. Worse fact health departments neglected past.
 
DROSTEN: Things change science too: Germany, example, medical research cancer-oriented. Infectious diseases extremely important medicine, noticing now. need lot research there. Antibiotic resistance next big issue. also applies us high-performance medicine. see takes revenge neglect fields activity seem affect us. really apparently.
 
**How get COVID-19 control countries global south?**
 
DROSTEN: western perspective, one would say need vaccination. that's easy think global south. clock ticking. spread countries slow. idea many people infected there. However, appear relatively deaths African countries. may obvious reasons this. Firstly, age profile: population simply younger. hand, immune system used many infections. Worm infections, example, universal there. affect immune system. know exact effect specific COVID-19 virus disease, could explanation.
 
**Germany currently holds EU Presidency - role Germany Europe play fighting global pandemic?**
 
GANTEN: current situation, increasingly bipolar world blocs USA China, Europe decisive role play. important thing international, multilateral cooperation, especially countries always shown cooperative past.
 
**So key improving global health care?**
 
GANTEN: Viruses human health threats know national borders. Therefore: International structures must strengthened. act together - courage, good ideas across borders. also applies science.
 
**How ensure everyone world access vaccine?**
 
DROSTEN: use existing structures: international organizations programs experience supplying countries global south.
 
GANTEN: strengthened. Incidentally, Europe Germany exemplary manner. think something else important: international, moral pressure science. academies science, advise respective governments heard public, particularly good this. individual countries participate, able withstand public pressure end.
 
**Do think people listen science future?**
 
DROSTEN: credibility science currently high, change quickly. moment nobody knows exactly epidemic play out. possibility whole thing longer controlled well despite scientific explanation science, example availability vaccines, simply slow. know science fared end. pandemic scientific phenomenon, natural disaster.
 
GANTEN: Science asked credible. must therefore keep eye whole process holistically, i.e. whole, also interdisciplinary manner: is, addition virological, example also economic, social political aspects pandemic. Nobody predict precision happen. Science must approach problems critically also self-critically. communicate way. Christian Drosten exemplary manner.
 
**What important lesson learn future?**
 
DROSTEN: pandemic getting started. Also us. speak lessons first wave Europe. huge differences alone. one say case relatively important inform population well comprehensively. damaging politicians use dynamics pandemic political messages. difficult - virus serves bill immediately. see USA. also seeing consequences Germany.
 
GANTEN: message clear: health important thing individual basis functioning society. Economy, culture longer work consider guaranteed longer there. I'm sure everyone really aware this.
 
DROSTEN: think so.
 
**If wishes - would be?**
 
DROSTEN: order control situation coming months, change things. need pragmatic decisions. already festive speeches German success, quite clear came from. success simply reacted four weeks earlier countries. responded exactly means others. done anything particularly well. earlier. That's successful. successful health departments better French, hospitals better equipped Italians. carry autumn, course realize continue anything better others.
 
**This means?**
 
DROSTEN: Argentina, example, spread difficult control despite measures - winter there. Germany take much differentiated closer look abroad. stop talking things like football stadiums. really completely misleading.
 
GANTEN :: course would like effective therapy vaccine.
But also find important finally becomes clear vital international multilateral cooperation is. repeat: education, education, education. educated society understands necessary measures, behaves sensibly, run pied peoples.
 
**When say made shake hands again?**
 
DROSTEN: ""you made it"" mean? Probably spread broken epidemic pattern. longer free wave infections running across population, local outbreaks controlled. situation achieved different countries different times. countries global south could case earlier age structure different. us, course, depends enough vaccines risk groups.
 
**So priority risk groups?**
 
DROSTEN: Yes, need 50 million vaccine doses Germany. addition expected distribution competence, also easy fill many vaccine doses bottles inoculate them. Even vaccine there. That's already undertaking whole 2021. Even one two approved vaccines available January, everything bottled vaccinated.
 
GANTEN: huge step forward would indeed vaccine effective therapy. one thing must forgotten: diseases still there, many avoidable deaths, example cardiovascular diseases infectious diseases, cannot controlled antibiotics longer work. hope that, lesson Covid-19 pandemic, better prepared challenges kind future. Prevention may cost money - failure take precautions dramatic consequences. No, 'wise up'. 

I'll continue go parties drugs, bang hoes, seethe ~~dormicile~~ little hole contract COVID from. Exactly. corruption normalized West made legal. time ruling politicians routinely flaunt immunity law. lookin kinda dumb, finger thumb shape “C” arsehole! Lol we're going anecdotal now? feel bad grandparents raise concentration camp defending grandson! know must feel like die International Tribunal shall power prosecute persons responsible following crimes committed armed conflict, whether international internal character, directed civilian murder;(b) extermination;(c) enslavement;(d) deportation;(e) imprisonment;(f) torture;(g) rape;(h) persecutions political, racial religious grounds;(i) inhumane acts.""

Trump's camps fit a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i! really. can't see amount deaths economic damage hospital cases alone, instance.

Cases recorded perfect either claiming that. Apple needs add dog nose technology iPhone, wave phone detect Covid, cancer, drugs, people buried rubble, etc. Yes, cadaver dogs used look dead bodies. training involves great deal murdering, people don’t stomach it. cases seem relate teachers testing positive school started, think 100 could school, whether open students not. Time take yoga. It’s saying people test positive high cycle thresholds contagious. that’s whole point testing fuck. need quarantine can’t spread anyone. That’s lockdown Bullshit, overinflated case numbers voice imprinted braaaiiinnnn high chance current western Phase III vaccines turn underwhelming (all experimental vaccines), Chinese vaccine work better (tried tested inactivated vaccine technology). happens then? people going trust take it? China going share it?

Inactivated vaccines also massive disadvantages, least usage decades. how? sounds dumb fuck A) There's heavy self selection bias going here. Districts likely reopen community prevalence low feel infection control good plan place. Main point, districts reopening remotely random sample.

B) early. If, widespread outbreaks end October, I'll say working well. no, need sharpen rhetorical skills. thing. questioned different standards applied camps versus camps Syrian Refugees - question answer. 

Only ICC intervened all, made single fucking comment. link homepage. relevant proof UN cares? doesn't. think know actual genocide looks like, know, grandparents literally lived thru fled WWII.  live symptoms enough go doctor hospital contaminate area, afraid die. Afaik doctors hospitals want see cough. it? send trainer, course him, follow certain book? want get dog soon, much absolutely loved childhood dog (RIP Lucy) I’d like next dog actually well trained. Missing title: They're allowed report HHS well. 
*Allow us hide truth lose medicare funding.*

We know HHS fully corrupt top. aims political safety well-being American people. point HHS data gathering may hidden manipulated serve Trump's goals. schools open students though. can’t find number many open. think Sweden used glaring example great nation well manipulative degenerates anything gain notoriety socials.

I think dabbing clearly deceptive. I'm fine that.

Sweden strong position hopefully take swift action maintain great level control. They've great example middle ground achievable. Instead nutting admitting wrong, downvote like child. CFR obviously 2% March; undercounting cases much larger ratio doubt higher IFR well. Yuh-You can’t shampoo shampooing shampooer! 200k+ people died. accept argument though, indeed difficult lot people accept microscopic particle stop things normally do. difficult accept virus LITERALLY cannot see things. People really like putting blind faith something like - when, yes, said, people around seem OK fine. Personally even know people affected sick SARS-CoV2 virus. go testimonials people hear, looking death numbers. questions arise buzzwords get thrown around, like 'herd immunity' 'vaccine' 'cause death.' reality I'm looking this: 200k+ people dead virus. work medical field, personally see it. rapidly spread rip band aid 'tired panicked' know - expert viruses, diseases, biology, shit like that. think remaining calm opening way go----but NEED given information - like exact timeline - safe re-open. without timeline given people assuming drawn conspiracy theories, etc. knew going happen. Especially people working home unemployment ending. shifts earnings pay structure harder track, average hourly wage data skewed higher disappearance low-paid service-industry jobs

People money eat restaurants anymore. Even local grocery stores laying employees. stores haven’t busy lately lot people money coming in. God, I'm sick articles like this.

Nobody likes wearing mask. We're really moment. vaccine made widely available, go way dodo short order regardless public health expert politician say it. Oh say naughty word. apologise insulting delicate constitution. I'm sure venom right now. one shared two nurse's *personally know* response covid. spoke personally that's experience speak from. went hospital couple weeks ago technician dick nose. pharmacy enforce wearing mask even sign saying wear one. Every interaction I've leads feel like direct medical community concerned media blasting be. believe Covid-19 real wear mask social distance. frightens medical community directly interacted seem hold thoughts. Solution: [put biology probably like weed they're smelling me

dogs love scalable? 

There lines outside CVSs live test swabs brain test near 100%. put system places ATL airport dogs close 100% sure 1000s would take ride testing today results today!

The swap test slow takes long time process. walk dogs line people entering exiting, think test many test faster method. Yes, people would drive testing center make work. mean... Yeah, thousands little typhoid Mary's running around. recall something similar happening US early too. Yes. Ron Paul stupid. also spouting pro-russia shit 2008, even appeared RT.

Honestly, wonder 2008 Ron Paul Russia's beta test 2016 Trump.

So many signs propaganda support especially conspiracy theory nuts seems line up. vote competent party avail. may shock taken every precaution since march. Thats I'm pissed frustrated cock wombles like you. 

I hate every fibre 200k+ dead US civilians? side note comment: going multiple vaccines, different approach virus, different interactions side effects possible long-term implications. 

So, get vaccinated, **keep paperwork**, keep place actually find it. It'll list type vaccine got date got it. issue arises specific vaccine future, reference paperwork see whether affects you: maybe people got Vax-K need booster two years, people got Vax-Q take aspirin two weeks help control potential inflammatory reaction, etc. sure sarcastic forgot, Obama's energy secretary first term Nobel Prize winning physicist, later succeeded former head physics department. Ah! Ableist idiot. problem see enforcing equally. haven’t seen order like before. went number like 670 deaths last time March 36 deaths Vietnam though. hit hospital Danang hard :(  Honestly, defense Sweden

1) Sweden's goal never herd immunity. think country antibody prevalence needed avoid second wave, let alone achieve herd immunity.

2) vast majority countries lack social responsibility needed replicate Sweden's strategy. could dog catch covid they're sniffing people it? Yes isn’t same. 17 year olds hang turn 18. scientific reason distinguishes them. ... almost flat, like way 100 times less daily cases similar level spring. Back like 1000 people dying day, 20-40. situation France basically European countries - cases slowly reaching spring levels death rate magnitude lower

I'm sure situation European countries UK Spring practically dying get test, overwhelming majority cases picked up. estimated getting 100K new infections day peak. nowhere near bad now, need make sure get way again. can't believe ""new cases pretty much useless"" getting upvoted sub now. Wow place really grown guess I'm understanding you. know virus mutated become less lethal, least reported reputable source. mutations fairly easy track pervasive change numbers lvl.

But would think inflating hospital numbers would change ifr? things change ifr (infection fatality rate) number infections number deaths. I'm confused well saying mutation makes less lethal. I'm saying numbers correct must lethal. (or needs many infections estimated, case article incorrect)

So ifr .33% 1 death...then must around 300 infections. ifr 1% 1 death...then must around 100 infections.

So .33 ifr (ala cdc) 61,979,400 infections. 61,979,400 10% us population. Yet cdc saying 90% still infected. cdc giving us 2 numbers same. One two must wrong. Either number infections higher, % fatalities is, period. Assuming typo crazy guy inside cdc anyway. Well wear mask almost everywhere except outside.

Our government big holes restrictions like wear mask school P. E. music. wear everywhere else school kinda absurd.

Also like half class missing like 1 week ago (about 10 people) nobody gived fuck. class discovered one former student visited school like 2 weeks ago Corona still nobody gived fuck even ate school close contact

They showed table Well, near half brain smell sense anyone tried meth see helps? sayin. LOL Well axios cites data worldmeter.com. Idk that's deceptive. fact reputable news sites use worldmeter, wonder why? Yeah false positive rate 0.1% millions people taking test dont yet symptoms bound get small communities freaking false positive. That's test positive need keep testing, said testing shitshow US slow spread virus community. happens still going take year set up. bad second round attempt vaccines though, think effective long lasting vaccine end next year. Oh fucking spaghetti monster, marvelous! subreddit March April? were, can't imagine woudn't saying that. workplace making mandatory year plan go back office January (I work healthcare) big part = owns massive amounts Microsoft stock Today went airport, scanned QR code got tested within less 20 minutes. Fo free less. US government reeeeaaaally dropped fucking ball, kicked away trying pick finally stumbled feet. 

Sorry y'all got fucked like :/ could release flight dates numbers Sorry break you, countries besides United States. traveled weekend (air travel). I’m feeling really since. like - bam - I’m way sick, super fatigued, lethargic, listless. like myself. got test earlier today see what’s what. freaking nothing? N95’s allowed airports.  

“Masks valves” aren’t.

N95 automatically mean valve. N95 filter rating. valved unvalved N95’s. valved unvalved KN95’s. 

3M several diff models. KN95’s mostly Asian market. 

In fact, N95’s minimum requirement social settings far effective cloth masks. Looked post history enough see one would get dumber reading it. know anything Canadian politics, seem like people like/didnt vote Trudeau reddit? can’t learn much seriousness virus infected 30 million people looking one case. anyway I’m sure last paragraph article supports conclusion:

“Franco, lost 66-year-old mother Covid-19, believes weight loss treatment -- including three operations -- helped survive diabetes hypertension control.” Can’t develop antibodies properly. I’m sure there’s name that. Lucky you. Trump would never think nuking Regina. big fan Regina. Loves Regina. rich, get lots Regina. lolol made lol Giant babies lul.

You mean literal first year college students 100 years asked teenagers fun last 4 years real world. Nothing medical free godforsaken country. Fauci fraud liar. dare someone question great Fauci. article Fauci cited cell immunity. guess Rand alone cell immunity camp. Fauci, Fauci seems forgotten flip flop statements. take everyside can't wrong truth unraveling fast old quack. sooner people realize deceitful liar better be. Thanks advice. Yes extra careful around sister. 4 days time I'll avoid eating place. However house time, never completely safe.

I forgot mention fistula near tooth removed might reason antibiotic prescribed. antibiotics affecting Covid know case, wondering whether they'll affect immune system, could turn change mild case Covid-19 serious one. ....thats....that's ""herd immunity"" though.

Those containment measures. That's different thing. Masks mandatory live, inside outside(Paris France) yet big new wave infections. I'm sure means, perhaps people hygenic washing hands enough. maybe issue office workers wearing masks view government. Well you’re using cycle thresholds 40’s they’re literally small amount virus particle body easily fight they’ve already fought off. presymptomatic viral load would much higher that’s fact. involved distribution injection vaccine rely Financial Times article prepare themselves? We're bigger trouble thought. click bait like uninformed Americans believe mutation = eventual deadly zombie virus.

Almost viral mutation genetic level leads survivalbility aka less deadly host. still bad overall vaccine either difficult produce less effective. Maybe globally? America. Scientists yet sure exactly dogs sniff detect virus. French study published June concluded “very high evidence” sweat odour Covid-positive people different virus, dogs could detect difference.

[A link Dogs absolutely amazing. Death rate confirmed cases/total deaths.

It varies massively based testing cases dead.

Just it’s table doesn’t mean it’s “objective reality.”

Literally first lesson every statistics course ever held “don’t blindly trust data, interpretation everything” you’re thinking business, leisure, see family holiday season, you’ll quickly discover different cities states different guidelines entry help suppress spread may mandate quarantines travelers, others require negative test result completed health forms.

Fortunately, there’s way navigate slightly dystopian environment. United Airlines released interactive country allows visitors see state region requires guests—or it’s even open all.

The map also allows users drill see destination restaurants non-essential businesses open well mask policies. I’d take antibiotic. end getting infection dental procedure, you’ll even worse spot. I'm going need see FPF TPF dog. They're tested, whatever reason. Positive.

It's ""Dr. House"" principle: ""Everybody lies."" time like present something Tegnells opinion asks least 15 peer reviewed studies reputable magazines. Asymptomatic / presymptomatic spread disease airborne example.


But seeks support opinion perfectly fine quote youtube charlatans like ""The Fat Emperor"" (Ivor Cummins).

International visitors know quite Swedes definitely like Anders Tegnell. Someone advocates something proven effective stopping spread deadly virus nothing idiot, probably better planet. no, vit d+b fix it. deficient may complicate situation covid19, won’t stop covid19. need good boys everywhere Ding ding ding. strange we're forcing kids exposed school/work, complaining keep economy running, opening fun stuff, wagging fingers participating it.

Always easier blame youth admit failed them. sniffing dogs cost apparently around $10,000 train.

What cost go into? bet sort semi-automated mass-training system bring costs.

How many tests sniffing dog conduct lifetime? expect way $10,000 worth COVID tests. Problem inconsistent reporting moving goalposts.

*How* close exactly talking here? thanks, sounded good always like ask around sharing. there's much fake news facebook Literally Ricky trailer park boys. Survival fitness. Social changes need part overall herd immunity strategy sure. Came say exactly this! Touché Incredible breakthrough 🥇


These researchers deserve nomination Nobel Prize. think distinction toxic -- what's point applied humans? 


We're HUMANS, decide want act. never gotten shot never gotten flu? remember want. enough video online sources show evidence said worry people getting pneumonia covid coukd kill could take two years get passed this. starting see journalists dropping f bombs part repertoire. Sony: \**laughs Playstation 5 release\** Rand Paul evil man political philosophy evil cancer society, especially comes healthcare. disagree everything stands exception willingness speak war. 
That said, asked good question. Look infection death curves New York. flatline. Deaths single digits 2 months.

I respect Dr Fauci think good job generally. answer question little disingenuous.

Nobody thinks 22% enough herd immunity, Rand Paul Fauci knows it. lot people test positive antibodies immunity. Children young people often get sick even live households infected people. innate immunity, cross immunity corona viruses, possibly T-cell immunity exposed people antibodies. Many experts believe this. Add could reach herd immunity. 
So Fauci answer question, basically said ""you're stupid, move on"". good attitude scientist. supposed be, people still getting billed them. ....so. know someone it. can’t get can’t give you. didn’t say one would get it, chances practically zero. think statement trying prove? chances getting incredibly small. kids back school weeks nothing. cause hear schools getting outbreaks doesn’t make norm. It’s incredibly small percentage schools problems. send millions kids school tens thousands cases result. small number. 

Yes it’s real, yes kills people still need put perspective look numbers like total deaths. doesn’t mean anything context deaths per population. Well feel like would worse fall winter like flu. Flu year round however people indoors significantly times spreads faster then. Lockdowns aren’t considered. That’s silly click bait reporting. 

And use argumentation: countries active cases right past “allowed spread”. different magnitude timing. Sure, trained cost 'test' conducted way cheaper cost conducting PCR test laboratory. Yes, downside daughters current Teacher slated one hybrid Teachers, virtual Teacher, despite knowing virtually daughter already loves death.

My wife Art Teacher choice use cart go class simultaneously ""live Teaching"" virtually students home. kinda ridiculous want constantly exposed. friend mine indoors class. 10 people so, wearing surgical masks spaced out. 


But curious, hypothetically speaking, let's say one person C19 positive C19 positive person wearing surgical mask. details, class lecture 1h30 mins. possibility students catching it? studies this?


Also, student wearing n95 would bring odds catching drastically less likely? whole point testing make sure contagious quarantine needed. barely virus contagious there’s point quarantining. Diabetic ketoacidosis severe neurological trauma come smells. genetically can’t smell ketoacidosis neuro breath real indescribably bad. smells like necrosis infection specific smells (C.Diff, dead bowel) cataloged time healthcare. Goodbye last drop freedoms Blocking particles better nothing. one ever said masks perfect. 

It’s like wearing condom. might bit uncomfortable, it’s absolutely guaranteed work, people still use *something*.  quite simple. definition age limit infant mortality rate differ countries US. break infant mortality rates countries using metrics US things actually look lot different. many countries child born considered ""unviable"" survive, count toward infant mortality. US, live birth ends mortality counts toward Might data protection issue there, especially flights involve Europe. may sounds bad, one death warn save thousands..... society teaches disposable pushes extraordinary, crippling debt chance education. Instead acting like young people terrible reason maybe examine feel lives meaningless. Covid virus, know would affected antibiotic. probably take doctor's advice, although personally think antibiotics over-prescribed. even infection, doctor gave antibiotics case might get one.

If postpone taking antibiotics, infection presents itself, would take all? Overuse antibiotics leads bad problems like c.diff.

Protect Covid. know case serious not. Please wear mask around sister first week two house use separate bathrooms eat table time. probably fine, careful pandemic appropriate. live? mild, good step! Great, apply totally non-racist, non anti-vaxxers exercise 'healthy scepticism' vaccines le ebic oxford. solid take, see misinformation. don’t care they’re contagious not? thought believed science, guess facts don’t support narrative time. hope get result soon anxiety put rest. entered era COVID-infected drug mules Genuinely downvoting objective reality

My guess hit 3% Thanksgiving schools close again. article based preprint. peer reviewed contain misinformation. Please take report grain salt. viruses accumulate mutations.  mean, Pfizer alone 100 million vaccines ready end year. they’ve dropping steadily rating countries caught up.

Hilarious... getting harder harder guys deny strategy relies herd immunity, it?

I say embrace it... according guys working, keep denying plan along? Dogs smell wayyy ya CoronaVac also tested Brazil, Turkey, Bangladesh Indonesia.

I think shared least countries. Told so.. I'm shocked! 

Well...not shocked. They've done testing numerous cities protesters vs control groups positivity rates virtually same. They've determined time time due outdoor settings high overlap protesters/people use masks significant source spread. 

Indoor settings virus well, look contract tracing studies, outdoor transmission common occurance.  people community risk college kids. got kidding me.

Spanish Flu come. generation wouldn’t life expectancy regardless Covid. suicides, drug doses overall unhealthy lifestyles wasn’t going happen pre Covid. add Covid list. Breathing heavily workout. seems logical Yes, done nothing would lot worse, best, greatest testing (except test positive, testing wrong) Couldn’t Trump’s super spreader rallies well? Shouldn’t start vulnerable populations instead 18-22 year olds? 

No, vulnerable population easily live otherwise interact 18-22 year olds.  Never would seen coming. Literally. Covid small  exactly 66 deaths due COVID children 15 US 2020. raise age 24 (the next available breakpoint data), goes whopping 419 deaths. **Four Hundred Nineteen deaths age 24.**

Looking percentage basis... COVID responsible 0.2% deaths 1 year age far 2020 (20 11,313 deaths); 0.7% deaths 1-4 years (15 2,158); 0.9% deaths 4-14 years (31 3,356); 1.6% deaths 15 24 years (353 COVID deaths 21,615 total deaths).

What causes similar levels fatality? Well, 1 years old, chart found lists Top 10 causes... #10 ""Neonatal Hemorrhage"" caused 375 deaths 2018 (versus 20 COVID deaths far 2020). children 1-4 years old, chart lists 10 #10 ""Cerebrovascular"", accounts 43 deaths 2018 (versus 15 COVID far 2020). kids 9-14, #10 cause death ""Benign Neoplasms"", responsible 49 deaths 2018, versus 31 COVID deaths 2020. Finally, 15-24 year olds, actually break Top 10... COVID would come #6 cause death age group, behind ""Heart Disease"" 905 deaths, equal ""Congenital Anomalies"" 354.

If 24 worried dying COVID, need understand low list likely deaths facing. really understand widely reported media.

This ridiculous, can't believe arguing wanting get sick. hell wrong you.

I talking per capita.. adjusted population size. Honestly understand think could get away spreading misinformation coronavirus sub... They're dead (yet). Lets see end w/ life expectancy generation had. Oh, taste/smell normally? Maybe country provides Healthcare support citizens. select wealthy.

Or maybe, thought, one frame several minute long interview. dog contracted Covid19? dog area had. Shocker. major concerns deficits he's running).

Canada sooner denied Canadian dollars Japan yen.

Sounds Trudeau right sac guy. much money make per flu shot? I'm sure know educated topic top comments discrediting idea. people known since beginning pandemic yet used countries.

Once stupid gullible thinks destroying world fix it. Destroying world conservative ruse maintain status quo. stupid gullible fall scam.  honestly less impressive dogs this, managed get across point wanted do. Finding trainable dog super easy. Finding working level class trainable dog difficult Yes, this. Makes sense too, young people getting infected builds group immunity low hospital load. time immunity virus spreads slower safer old people. example recorded 12 new cases coronavirus since yesterday, total number cases at 20,105.

All test results within 24 hours Chinese companies among best world. China run people, America run corporations. Who’s good boi? that, smells like ester compound.. doctors know might be? TIL Seamen mouth known taste foul Frenchies pissed Italians saying new plague spreaders taking revenge pizza affair early pandemic C+

(I'm joking guys, kill me) much done except remind people cautious move colder months. going really cold winter temperatures see cases increasing, think. Due low humidity. next week, RH indoors drop suddenly even furnaces come week -- everything inside houses building let vapor things really get dry. Low RH lets respiratory droplets travel farther, aerosolize quicker, hang air longer. possible, would make much sense old people. Young people pick immunity little hospital load, old people not. insane. Must nice worrying getting paid work home Recognizing effects toxic masculinity forces men act stoic sexist now? please clarify? america bad, good take misconstrued statements. say eradicated completely? say words? say them, also repeated several times. seemed gloss part. fair POV. 

To me, part owning business preparing kinds situations, knowing appropriate close use available capital elsewhere; bleed last cent. I’ve done small business owner, left good jobs saw financial political stress likely eliminate program/office (government.)

Restaurants notorious high-risk, high-failure-rate businesses. interest, desire, even culinary skill isn’t sufficient ensure profitability/longevity.

All businesses eventually stop; part ownership knowing get get certain sectors; adapt changing marketplace/regulatory environment.

I think many (unwisely) thought would weeks, months years; didn’t act accordingly proactively. name news source: france24.

France record numbers exponential Time lock again. Went hospital told policy let anyone hospital surgical gloves masks on. use paper masks. pointed mask real N95 mask offered put paper mask N95 mask. got supervisor still made take far superior mask. make sanitize hands. hand pumped sanitizer kind automatically dispenses. asked could put new surgical gloves afterwards answer no, despite pointing latex. hospital also give pair own. guy policing wearing gloves.

Next, crowded elevator, stopping every floor, trying everything possible touch face. doctor's waiting room filled people coughing. Every time breathed paper mask, glasses fogged up. 

Paper gives protection distanced. meant used environment become aerosolized.

Guess doctors wearing: surgical gloves, N95 masks face shields.

This rural hospital. one prestigious hospitals US: Mass Eye Ear. 

The Covid-19 death rate consistently higher states getting cases. Yesterday, #28 cases, #16 deaths. I'm late 20s. work pretty solid job office. office rules ""have to"" wear mask except desk. rules loosely enforced all. People tendency wear mask get desk take off. many people respectful ask put back really take seriously. many people going bars eating restaurants going gym. kinds normal things. 

I say makes likely partake riskier behaviors well honestly feel like I'm already taking risk getting none pleasure. still go bars eat patios likely engage friends BBQs things like that. tough thing manage. social need social happy. lot phone calls video calls things still tough me. winter comes going get tougher. going interesting winter ti say least. Personally, I'm going spending trying balance seeing people virus seeing people stay deep depression.  live Boulder, guess would ""more often expect."" Grocery stores, restaurants, professors, walmart, etc.

The college students coronavirus, likely person gets infected would live person vulnerable.

Also remember, elderly vulnerable, vulnerable elderly. winston churchill said defeat hands roman empire 1776: 

“It is.” don’t English versions them, maybe someone could help you. Yeah, Montana, schools open 4 6 weeks modified attendance mode. school, home study, combined, school sports activities. would thought could happen? saw anti mask protest outside high school Kalispell. Moms masks, stupid thing. Always thought moms protected kids?

Montanans part, pretty individualistic. Looks like going get chance practice individuality alone ICUs. last report total 164 ICU beds Montana (pre covid count) sure now, 6 months covid means somebody, somewhere, must preped, right?

We good labor day since shit storm. new period following labor day, think ever saw day 200 new infections.

Well new normal now! Funny. remember seeing hundreds schools close due covid. think teacher tracking 900 last saw weeks ago. ""little thing"". global pandemic. page linked state 'surprisingly low'?All get FAQ match search it. 
Edit: oh, reading comments seems one posting surprised? idk.. Exponential growth boom Ironically automod removed comment quoting you. going civil? still personally insulting like last time? 

I never attacked you, disagreed got angry. quite uncouth. rookie mistake.

It norm public transportation Madrid. People still clueless cases keep rising. blame mandatory masks haha know I'm right there's opposing argument hear insults.

Everyone knows I'm right ""feel good"" people lash truth. spread disease others

proof asymptomatic carriers ones creating pandemic? 

Dr. Faucci literally said ""asymptomatic carriers driving force this, never driving force pandemic. symptomatic carriers drivers pandemic."" 

So proof? currently living Governor joke regarding COVID-19 since beginning. ahead game unless game continuing spike. 

In St. Louis County wearing masks since beginning. However, counties surround spiking like crazy. 

It seems like never dig hole. It’s always damned turtles way isn’t it... actually think government FHM favor going recommendation. FHM less pressured musicians sports clubs raise recommendation number people allowed.

A weeks ago might looked like good idea right need lower R value restrictions relaxed.

Kind wish double back promise allow visitors eldarly care homes october. like opening Pandora's box. quote Bill Gates count. 

Is is? really examples thing people accusing sub never noticed sub doing? 

Because somebody wrong, either cadre malcontents. far, evidence side. Unless somebody supplies better proof, assume people accusing sub unwarranted hysteria making up, pulling nonsense thin air, spreading fake news, talking hats, full baloney. Agreed. got flu first time 26 years old, years ago. I'd never felt sick life. know whole lot co-infections really want one people find out? 24 cases? That’s neighborhood USA. mention single shot dose, see results Phase 3 much quicker doble dosed. We’ve tried explain several times. It’s willful ignorance Alberta Hicks     see Swedish subreddit thread, celebrating US (barely) overtaking Sweden population adjusted mortality, since deny mask science peace.

This moment celebrate, moment demand responsibility Swedish state come senses. Start listening science, stop putting head sand. Replace incompetent CDC, take responsibility, start rebuilding stockpiles. Make sure response future crises never pathetic. heard? Every country world exactly everyone like New Zealand covid would gone?

Except Italy, Spain, France etc. tried they're seeing record cases now. almost rapidly spreading virus complex problem many factors affecting spread. ""falling cliff bad health, worry, everything side effects"" - you. Cornell University resumed in-person learning quarantining testing students returned. faculty tested. students faculty tested ongoing basis.

They maintained acceptably low level positives. That's best way it, safe.

NYC plan - hopes. tested 1 student - one - prior reopening. staff testing mandatory sufficient level. If/when cases turn schools, plan isolate students direct contact - go far enough, likely result spread. Students going tested couple weeks, even randomly sampled.

The whole thing recipe disaster, DeBlasio Carranza know it. Private schools happy fill void, they're hungry money keep running give shit anyone's health.   something non-sequitur, much hinges fluctuation effective reproduction number (rate) around one, could see ""herd resistance"" mattering. course, number would much higher one many places going business normal. Look positive cases rapid city area spike right rally.  think still appreciate hard workers, appreciate handworkers add significant value. Many middle class positions easily replaced/automated thus add much value. Even ""cutting edge work"" I'm sure redundancies positions responsibilities. gonna say might overkill considering wife older least enjoying nature seems like balanced approach So... what? Tell me? Moving remote teaching disaster Germany, hard believe teachers even owning computer. Yes. 2020.
That refering think, third world computer usage schools. You’ve lucky far. Maybe won’t future.

Thanks high-contact jobs past, managed catch flu least twice. young healthy FUN. shot better, say needle-phobic person.

And little risk get shot decent doctor pharmacy. flu shot dead-virus vaccine, means literally impossible get flu it. may reaction (I usually do) that’s immune system reacting something new blood. exactly immune system supposed do. It’s keep regulations level halts spread virus 

Bullshit. never said aimed halt spread virus. always ""slow spread"". Yes smell virus? wont believe based stupid article zero science behind it....  We're also still keeping cautious -- two young kids played kids. avoid stores much possible, restaurants, quarantine mail packages. kids zoom met friends, remote kindergarten. try make comparison like we're like living ship woods. try make enriching lives constant stream new books (the budget used museums, gym membership, etc., try spend enriching kids lives somehow. go outside much possible walks, hikes, biking, they're learning tennis. Still, breaks heart socialize, always remind pros cons. wife older side parents know wife tend get hit hard illnesses -- could see either one us ending hospitalized get covid. One thing work office people. double mask (KF-94 + surgical mask it). Honest happy rise cases neighboring countries quickly changed Denmark took off.

But honestly Sweden ALSO example confirmed cases indication death coming. Sweden 1.700 cases July, 3x 2x it’s seeing still several days 0 deaths. virus mutated feeling. *think* that’s sarcasm, folks. Reference Sillocon valley TV show side effect mask use reduced spread virus killed nearly 1 million people worldwide counting. Hey Dr Rockso! Shh, earnhardt fans disagree. Everything gray area cost benefit analysis. without kids saying it’s worth risk schools open, would feel many people saying grocery stores shouldn’t open grow/kill/forage food. dare want force agricultural workers, truck drivers, warehouse workers, grocery store workers back work. Don’t American airlines require negative covid test prior boarding?  guys’ thoughts universities opening spring 2021? Fauci says widespread vaccines starting available around April. mean class 2021 proper graduation ceremony, right? Many universities planning late start late January early February hybrid person online classes overall return classes spring break whatsoever. 

Some universities, like California, already decided fully online classes spring. makes sense seems early make decision. seem relying case forecasts proven quite inaccurate. many students like feel scammed online classes since really aren’t learning anything everyone basically cheating exams. also deprived completely social interaction online classes it’s taking massive toll mental health, yet still paying thousands dollars. university hasn’t made announcement yet spring look like don’t see can’t late start restrictions like limiting class sizes mask mandate. last semester I’m particularly heartbroken thought continuing like this.

Personally crossing fingers university shift online hybrid—I’m expecting fully person plan (I go school big city) don’t mind wearing mask. want social life back leave house...I depressed miserable sure didn't. apparently read article either. progress referred ability give vaccinations like TB/HPV/HIV countries couldnt afford them. immunization efforts permanent hold Virus. mindless consumerism, peoples lives fucking smoothbrain. least recognize it. many college kid living college town living elderly person? You’re right now. Fully agree. effect businesses, jobs, lives, community organisations, disabled rely care workers homes help live rewarding life, long term damage terms paying furlough schemes like on. can't believe seeing daily basis terms lack care. I've idea matter lot people country. simply can't see we're right old mess stands, get worse going 'round circles opening closing; jobs, businesses, lives, community organisations lost every circle comes goes: get grip it.

I mean, much asked people. read fucking sign wall follow it, even we're talking grasp 2 metres such. 'Defies belief happening. Yeah, pretty dumb huge development got 20 upvotes ***four separate articles*** dude front page. Makes think, huh? 10% CDC suggested?

Did actually read posted?

30% Queens 30% NYC.

Sweden 13th highest death rate barely behind US. either one things happen try Los Angeles Clippers [archive link anyone trouble accessing article  Singers expel air spittle per minute much greater force average person talking. That’s singing dangerous time COVID. Whatever happens matter much. He'll probably fine - are.

What care many people directly indirectly infected many died. Protecting personal choice health, community. WH announced might override FDA vaccine rules. much Trump’s stealth herd immunity.

You know, tell people big deal hope heard immunity resolves issue.

The problem 200K Americans dead 400K projected January. ended Trump, many realized “Luther” fucking lie ...why would think different?  States open still deliver better numbers NYC. Go enjoy life like rest people used hangout board realized life end virus. skeptical 33 million immune. strategy herd immunity guess worked? They’ve low number deaths per day (low single digits) months, mentioned aren’t significant case rises rest Europe. Hardly anyone hospital COVId. think keeping numbers last months don’t think they’ve done anything slow virus, “herd immunity” miles away? 

It’s wrong say didn’t anything try stop spread virus. took lighter touch rest Europe. think lighter touch social distancing measures, combined relatively high levels population immunity, keeping situation control. Yes suppose better false positive going restaurant false negative experts agreement Fauci, imagine that. 🤯 

Your economy “recovered?” 😂 Might wanted inform 19 year old saw ICU exactly getting flu. 
Tbh think basic thing taught PE. Helsinki Sweden? /j would true large group indoors. Forty people room put lot heat.  10% rate CDC suggested life go on. NYC 30% antibody like Sweden flat COVID numbers. One locked look IFR numbers total COVID-19 deaths, probably around 40 million infections US, roughly speaking. makes sense long listen science, would make better president current American president. Almost feels like sub devolved us vs polarisation bad things happening 'bad' ones ok either justifies viewpoint allows people express malice.

Yes, that's 2020 nutshell. I'm electrical engineer that's working cutting edge projects autonomous driving one world's leading automotive suppliers.

Society stopped appreciating hard workers bombing middle class crisis crisis. Effectively result pensions, real estate salaries getting drained capitalist overlords.

By now, that's scheme, know is. Stock markets become really lame much money determine stock prices yourself. course problem elimination strategy long virus exists planet vaccine, always come back need lockdown again, unsutainable long term. That's politicized people letting politics get way common sense. sad. many nurses anti vax still politics, regardless issue. capable understanding basic science themselves, involve politics suddenly trust scientists science. stupid. appreciate chart, one annoyed put smallest bars top rather bottom make easier compare? total lockdown isn’t even answer like others:

Are Belgian? Left leaning scandals overall slow pace indecisiveness, I'd ready vote Progressive Conservative government...

Except PCs dead, united right wing never support matter basic morals. So, liberal again. Nice job breaking it, conservative party. Never step foot /r/politics.

If conservative, everyone hate you.

If liberal, wonder sub makes seem like liberals batshit crazy.

If batshit crazy, though, love it.  Considering holding rallies everywhere right - probably considering positives cropping accomplishments. Etin TORILLE kommenttia mutta ei vaan löydy know... would actually really fucking smart Netflix. Set way fund potential titles / series, type goal reward system. 

I mean, works fucking EA, release promise game $60, help fund rest game buy DLC.

 I'd spend money get reboots certain series movies. Like imagine firefly universe differnt perspective firefly. Maybe rebel group core worlds? 
Top donors could even get little cameos, even cgi shows (like 21st century version Lower teirs could get various levels merch etc. 

Then Netflix solid indicator interest projects, save small amount production, marketing etc. 

Idk maybe dumb. I'm really boring work meeting. &lt;10% US antibodies. 5 months wide spread / 2 weeks infectious period gets &lt;1% currently infectious. Less 10% likely infectious person room 10. Add protection level mask confidently 1%.

Of course distribution smooth, situation dynamic, swag, usual disclaimers. Username checks out. Relax bit, see sun winter comes. Oh maybe let child play kids, really important mental development. wont drop dead take part society. Masks physical distance help ease fear. think Sweden much testing really getting hit. Confirmed cases always lower actual infections, case numbers probably especially low compared unknown reality. Doggos save humanity brink destruction again! Nobody believes that. Shut fuck up. Yeah, wonder something body gives that's specifically *because* virus virus itself. ‘no maskers’ use excuse, it’s prolonging virus wearing masks? that’s convincing people ‘they won’t get disease don’t believe it’ college kids live people vulnerable, interact people live people vulnerable. suggestion actually achieve goal protecting people risk. Awesome article work Raj Chetty. r/dataisbeautiful  really came facts. even mentioned would fail hat even taking initial test. obviously going issue. don’t tell us wear anything heads bit scheduled appointment get accurate temperatures? could put info text send saying “call get outside blah blah blah.” No. overweight obese comorbidity 71.6% American adults have. New Zealand locked island. sparsely populated. see little different parts planet? changed title. important fact left hand fresh air closed window. air conditioning hot. They'd fine they'd kept mouths shut.  contrary.

This subreddit filled antimaskers pro-plaguers. depends kind exercise. read study recently stated aerobic exercise particular improves bodies resistance stress, however weight lifting didn’t appear offer benefits, contrary might believe. poster suggested stuff like tai chi, yoga, light aerobics, walking something i’d also recommend. Ok, yeah, that’s thought, thank clarifying That's great fucking news. Congrats New Jersey ""introverts"" actually pathologically anti-social really see issue forcing everyone isolate years. normal population sense, BLERN, BLEEERRRRRNNN! fan scandal I'll still take alternatives. Fucking moron. speculation 'wave' reinfections coming weeks.

And then, one day, ill president. hospitalisations probably better indicator well controlling virus.

But really 'controlled' thousands thousands confirmed effective potentially doubling every week, even deaths remain low? Death bad thing comes covid.

To thousands upon thousands confirmed daily sign control all. Yep... also ""herd immunity"" strategy.

New Zealand took another path. never aiming simply ""flatten curve"", aimed eradicate virus halting local transmission.

That's half population Sweden, 40 times fewer cases 120 times fewer deaths.  read article? windows closed air conditioning on. also didn’t mask time. IMHE originally said state would basically (hospitalizations single digits IIRC) August. actually death peak (so far).

Not blame them. much know. Antibody testing gold standard testing past infection. antibody test, quantifiable method would provide evidence populations immunity? decreasing cases graph sufficient? specifically attribute decrease cases herd immunity? course, would probably see another northern country like Canada, right? 

LIKE wonder sending money oil companies Alberta Harper though. know controls narrative resource extraction dependent province. shows, soon lockdown ends, it’s effectively useless done all. try say lockdown vaccine, pretty much everyone collectively laugh you. People aren’t going give much lives less 1% risk. Back watching Starcraft BroodWar... wait I've always done that. Gretchen, stop trying make zoom gatherings happen. They're going happen! top 10 countries deaths

No not. Sweden counts deaths accurately, unlike many countries. pretty sure know excess mortality shows different picture, want make sound dramatic possible. 

Many countries locked worse numbers Sweden does, simple, yet. Right now, people talking spread **at moment**, **total** numbers, know that, harder drama queen that. Good Boy people get exemption wanting take something rushed production properly vetted like medication would be? TMC stats straight source, state. lazy people respecting basics Wuhan opened nightclubs 🤔 support ""re-education"" camps? come dude. Also let's think this. ICE bad claim immigrants continually come country illegally anyway. USA protesters marches demanding better treatment people ICE facilities. shit ain't allowed China people protested shut lovely ""re-education"" camps. policies focus Ontario Quebec Alberta.

He sending money Alberta Harper, let facts get way. hope breathing heavily certain person's direction So? can’t die flu? treatments pretty good prevent deaths elderly too. doubt anything worry Right?! True even this! worked kids always hand washed, sanitized soon left building, disinfected door knobs such. Safe say lot practice years served preparation main event: republicans 2020. Cool. think we're agreement. I'm living life isolating 2022. good one! Ridiculous. Another example incompetent leadership using sledge hammer drive finish nail. US. Every country half idiots. Americans chose Hillary. got fucked electoral college. media outlet discovers sewage testing dogs detect virus every day.

Both known 6+ months. taking much longer expected roll out. Hey. still better NY what's problem? /s know sustainable means?  Fuck that. public health perspective would argue benefit humans social interaction worth risk. limits, course. Outdoor better indoors, masked better masked, small better large. we're already starting see surge depression suffering extended isolation causes. *needs* part calculus governments roll restrictions.  200,000 2,150,000 died year deaths recorded Covid deaths.

It's far less scary people use context. people like don't. surprised French cities surprised big trouble? places arnt even locked right many folks acted like things normal lockdowns lifted rising cases surprising right now. Dont dense. It’s also super illegal think good move believing cable news Facebook CDC NIH, there's nothing anyone say you. cult ignorance.  two options:

That absolutely ridiculous statement. That's insane argument. tried back April, many people died. We've learned lot virus since then. get yall getting antsy deal this, scale bad things happened world, one easier wait out. yolo go party see end tunnel attitude that's causing superspreader events killing lots people. important business, sure go it, ""get back living"" ravaging areas like Texas, politicians told us since beginning ""get back living"" killing people economy bad, they've wrong whole time. Schools pressured reopen fully governor lifting everything now, there's way I'm going right now. vaccine takes 2022 fine, I'm getting strokes permanent respiratory issues it. main point think media beginning focused much big deal young people. think explain lack concern younger people display

The media government also demonised young people drivers pandemic. Ignoring part suffer mild illness work minimum wage jobs likely go work even sick safety net.

If young people demonised would care anymore? expected work bone, dare go see family friends evil granny killers. ended backordered, maybe get month so, ordered said stock treatment become much better days first peak. remember said 40% ICU would die China. new treatment could reduce significant %. 


Comparing deaths waves correct, hospitalisation would best guess compare true amount infected people. I've essential worker since Day 1. get stressed times crowd size, lack distancing, masks. mental health fair.

My wife's friend quarantined since late February. jobs anymore. 37 years old zero prospects. groceries delivered stays inside 99% time. day venture possible part time job interview broke sidewalk sobbing, overcome anxiety severe agoraphobia everyone's cavalier attitude virus; never made interview. regressed physically, socially, emotionally. 

Looking two, folks choosing try venture rather commit life crumbling away musty apartment. combination improved testing, younger demographics main source spread, better treatment hospitalized cases. Deaths likely high spring, pretty clear Europe nowhere near herd immunity, lot people still die. Especially hold don’t find anything different. 1. Show Texas forced nursing homes matter policy
2. Show anyone holding Greg Abbott national hero
3. Poor Cuomo. “one mistake” killed people died virus total states. get DKA bacterial vaginosis easier observe firetruck-red throat instead smelling? talking strep elsewhere able smell. That’s even countries locked down, surging cases, right? It’s almost shutting society real benefits long run, like people saying months now. News ending unfortunately doesn’t get kind engagement 80 year old man ones ever heard denying Covid getting sick So, countries actively trying **eradicate** (not suppress) virus land, tough measures hard lockdowns? Vietnam, Taiwan? else?

All countries **not** mention herd immunity strategy suppose? Yea maybe weeks 1 8 Jesus man kids school bars open. fart wind. wear mask everywhere follow guidliness NOWHERE still shelter place policy! go bar resturaunt silly see family point especially kids limit contact activity. fuck must really nice 88,000 cases there. one plane Italy, close 6000 ICU beds Italy put perspective, 16 quite small number them...

much meaningful way help transporting small amount ppl increasing number beds place Neither boomers voted feels like sub devolved us vs polarisation bad things happening 'bad' ones ok either justifies viewpoint allows people express malice.

Seems like happy take part it, going post history one countries exact nationwide lockdown. half subreddit (Many hate Trump supposedly authoritarian) issue creaming pants daddy government sends bobbies arrest people going outside, protesting (unless groups like) talking certain amount story short, Sweden 'success' story occurred according reddit logic. also disproves nationwide lockdowns needed, affecting self-esteem introverts want force way life everyone else.  works humans really don’t deserve dogs. I’m sure isn’t first time dogs single handedly saves humanity. I'm sure this'll make everyone feel much confident vaccine! Wow, envy you. Thanks spending money restaurants though, sure need business. right. taking walk around Williamsburg, see jews walking around without mask. mindboggling really. know probably lack technology information. also pure stubborness [Here](http://edsuom.com/covid19/US-200923.png) curve fit “logistic growth multiple growth regimes” two weeks extrapolation actually shouldn’t taken seriously, really can’t tell what’s going happen slight uptick. model fitting within around 1% past 17 weeks, tells it’s pretty good way identify current daily growth rate. number currently 0.6% per day, also happens yesterday.

Yes, naive model based solely reported case numbers, lots limitations. I’ve still found useful get feeling what’s going throughout pandemic. Interestingly, woman smell Parkinson’s. [Joy Lol busy watching people pigs Zero intervention?

Lol.

You know military deploy teams rural Tx run hospitals right?

And FL mobilized 3,000 additional doctors nurses?

And TX FL masks mandatory populous counties.

Or people became distant things went south, cut back needless interactions.

But yes exponential growth present places slowed velocity interaction slowed down. come back seeing Europe whole.

How ignorant?

And 10-20 days? Can’t count past toes eh? hope positively tested individual okay  Yes, I'm trobles finding two articles sgain, ones find like listing new variant.

Same. mean unless country kind ""shutdown"", shops open, extension, malls. stadiums closed ""events"" special restrictions. I'm Italy far I'm aware, shops open normal there.

I guess still countries cities various kinds shutdown, quite compared spring. think European country shutdown lockdown atm? Clearly Tegnell’s strategy one results fewest Coronavirus deaths, that’s exactly they’re aspiring to... they’re aspiring approach consistent minimizes burden aspects society, like education, economy, public health COVID, etc. Oh yeah, agree. think people little grasp covid-related statistics. [I wanted quiet Yeah agree. also think constantly detecting positive instances (especially people around) time not, turned Yeah high chance definitely poorly worded part, should’ve said chance. However many people report feeling fatigued symptoms make feel like months recovering. research indicated seems like lasting effects many people, there’s way really know extent happens.

My main point think media beginning focused much big deal young people. think explain lack concern younger people display allowed coffee shop today downloaded app scanned QR code . option leave phone number Forgive ignorance, causing current surge cases Europe? Cylons seriously hard successful. Reddit holding pen lot people like externalize problems refuse take responsibility them. widely available vaccine would start point can’t trust people act good others pandemic.

I personally know someone went Crete holiday. arrived hotel everyone one sick end August.

Scary stuff right, missed shift argument. two linked, though t-cell cross reactivity primary reason herd immunity threshold lower pandemic.  Heterogeneity susceptibility primary influence, barely touched (and misrepresented that) article.

That's source control, arguing protective benefit wearer, there's need universal masking. Individuals choose wear like.

There never need course literature public mask use remains unchanged 2019 - there's evidence reduce transmission. aerosol transmission, that's even true. mask mandates correlate case decline.

Even so, arguing mask protects wearer, others. Ignoring absurdity argument, tacitly admitting lack source control efficacy. dies MEANINGLESS current views mask opponents!

No, give 20% mortality rate, that's bullshit. would 6-12% mortality rate would 80yo obese. 65 years, even close that. Better sword shield #1 rule meth-science. Thank sharing. No, going first place! Completely avoid risk catching virus there!

Virus dangerous:

\-Lung scarring. Cannot breathe used called 'asymptomatic', still get internally way, mask actually sealed air tight face, ie see gap mask face? Air still get gap letting virus.

AND - virus I've heard infect eyes too. way, immediate suggestion, wear something like swimming goggles prevent contaminated air getting eyes.

So, least duct tape edges mask face, mask needs good filter way, swimming goggles.

However, probably look towards better things mask goggles - full head cover, seals air tight, better yet fully enclosed suit. something least like head cover make DIY garbage bags something wear - garbage bags, form shape around head, cut hole see of, cover seal said hole clear plastic like lunch bags, cut hole near mouth place HEPA filter fabric area something better -- head cover, need make sure actually seal AIR TIGHT letting filtered air, example put head cover head get duct tape attach lower part neck so.

It dangerous big hassle deal taking completely avoidable risks - completely unnecessary begin with. wait till vaccine - seems there's talk already mass producing vaccines moment.

Sitting interior, virus saturated place, floating air like dust. Gets hair, clothes, wearing simple mask that's actually sealed air tight, eye protection - virus eventually seeps around gap mask falls eyes infecting you. even wearing stuff like goggles sealed mask - actually clean getting inside home, tracking virus inside, virus still hair clothes, body - easily lead cross contamination! Ie virus falls clothes like dust starts floating air breathe in, laying virus falls hair perhaps eventually works way nose, breathing way -- much hassle deal with! think base cares black man, matter Herman think himself. Right. Again, comment responding saying funding taken away research conventional diagnostic medical mean think billions spending develop technology detect COVID, spit, getting swabs stuck nose poked needles 60-70% effective test. Instead could pet dog get 98% accurate say bring dogs.

Not moving dog training money around. agree using dogs quickly screen people places like airports good idea. I'd rather dogs trained detecting covid drugs. believe virus-sniffing dogs could effectively replace conventional medical testing global scale. **Everyone Liked That** oh nooooo :( price fabric oh human rights individuality oh noooooo :(((((( ain’t happening bro, happening American streets riots written it’s nefarious group? Independent review boards standard vital safety vaccine, want them. WHAT? way!!! 🤦‍♀️ happy though! must love getting covid Americans programmed ignore reality seek fantasy. Think many people still believe 'The American Dream' available us pipe dream never reach. society completely failed people sense folks equipped think critically address problems instead ignoring pretending situation different. 

You wrong nuts people ignoring this, expected population taught blind faith fantasy world important tackling tough stuff. Also, volume African air travel tiny compared continents. one country huge COVID breakout (South Africa) several busiest airports Africa. still hope someone makes movie, even better limited TV series, based book. Brad Pitt movie name, that’s thing matched book. hearing wait two weeks since states started opening four months nothing happening.

Here recent video ATL people enjoying clubs Mayor ATL makes sound like life going end country shut NH opening 100% indoor dining spike happened neighboring Massachusetts wont open death rate 70 spiking Boulder County.

This chart shows total deaths age Oh know. love asking people explain downvotes. almost never can. reply all, usually toss insults ignore objective, provable facts. Good luck! keep proving point lol Surge mostly due college towns. look somewhere like Covid Act Now, shows county break college towns high list states. Mortality rate 65yo obesity would around 1-3%. 97-99% chance live.  thanks based no-mask-no-distancing policy 💪😎💪 virus may kill old people kill stock market ✊😣 Nothing makes happier see two strangers come decency chippy words. need that. That's 0.0125% population. We've got quite ways go. vote him, he's done good job covid. spring everyone panicking, daily briefings issue seriously, gave reassurance. many policies kept Canadians black. $2,000 month save LOT people losing home. 

And shout Premier Ford (who also would never vote for) worked Trudeau taking seriously. ...what? TIL dogs smell viruses. That’s fucking incredible.   Federal ""leadership"" done anything prevent first wave, let alone second. way know vaccine worked still effective (despite fading) without catching virus? head world fear still vulnerable really sure? city dwellers working tiny apartments - anywhere go safely get work done avoid cabin fever? worked home COVID would go coffee shops like, South Florida I’m even sure they’re seating inside yet (and it’s still hot sit outside comfortably.) lot people left. stay it’s home. made contingency plans leave temporarily gets bad again. Right well. getting vaccinated Bill Gates: *""I know listening since '80s want swallow vomit""*

...doesn't intelligent employees allow get ahead world, himself, every time? *Clostridium difficile,* still likely. I'd bet money it. shit go away, people spontaneously get it. Usually follows course antibiotics, something disruptive natural gut flora. also respiratory heart side effects. inaccurate information? masks supposed uncomfortable effective? dont want survive, want live diseases battled many years ago, time wealth singular coveting wealth power prevalent economy today. absolute disregard others soaring.

Science, conscientious doctors, power control, obvious you. increased legal penalties parties made clear us start wouldn’t tolerated. guess suspensions placing hundreds students academic probation weren’t enough? Yup. I'll believe surge death rate starts climbing. possible people still think Sweden kind heard immunity strategy. never never said had, still people keeps thinking this. honestly dont understand it. sniffer needs adjustment. look happened Israel. reopened schools massive spike cases, despite initially good response first wave. it’s bad they’ve reinstituted full blown March lockdown get back control. Look graphs look future.  Actually, would fuck world exponentially, again, 230 million people dead, would fuck world economy would lead us even greater economic depression before. very, unlikely humanity get infected. pleasant day aswell sir. Source ? way. mean temperature checks thought president said kids can’t get spread anyway. believe article, wondering, didn’t know that. didn’t realize sounded, sorry Sounds like someone task force might finally balls. Late better all. Seek help. Ever heard saying two wrongs make right? well known CCP horrific things Uighers China. highly criticized like U.S. treatment minorities. dad direct contact covid19 subject.. isolation room scared get virus something might happen him. completely healthy 3 days since touched guy symptoms now. know whether covid19 affect dad, may catch virus? even RHEL 7. Redhat 7. That's 20 years ago (also one first Linux installs ever). Maybe get another France Revolutionary War situation another country steps in? US title global superpower would pretty undermined point, get someone good (lol) 2024 could return time

edit said someone knows little frances actions 1776 lockdown! opendoor policy before? Online fall semester. I've heard many IC students came back town anyway (because lease issue), actual evidence/firsthand knowledge. that's true, lends lot credence Cornell's theory opening proper testing much safer opening. lose credibility try augment reality. went Duke medical school ophthalmologist, meaning surgery peoples eyes. It’s something make up. hotair.com - conservative blog known putting partisan drivel. take anything say big grain salt totally agree. also true there's huge profit potential chaos. Keeping workers wrecked allows company control narrative, conduct alternative business hide information. also stay place fighting job we're weak. I'm saying reinforce point make clear consent class system abuse. thoughts prayers speedy death. need pass law? US anti-mask president actively encourages supporters wear masks? best reply seen Internet weeks. lmao what? live Colorado people saw wearing masks East Asian exchange students. 1,000,000÷7,500,000,000 = 0.00013333

I'd say world fine. People wear mask chin people never homework copied. He'd hidden away somewhere. way people understand unsubtle subtlety get hear need know morons none wiser. That's really generous. 10/10 survive. live Antioch, IL. Half life IL, half WI.

My old, previous COVID, close friend, wedding October, Bennet barn Wisconsin. wants masks, signs ""the pandemic times"" photos. testing, masks. 


My fiance susposed wedding party. dropped out, obligated go. I'm Healthcare provider quarantine dumb dumb DUMB wedding.

I hate much feeling entitled wedding. can't wait another year marriage joke. pray idiot state Wisconsin actually starts caring imposes regulations. hate mask weddings thing right now. know morons feel horrible continuing ideas....

COVID really making see disgusting parts people society. report Brazil (note .br) confirmed vaccine significant adverse reaction Brazilian volunteers either, idiot. can't directly compare two settings. First 1918 completely virus type mutated deciding sequences thus especially killed young people. Right see second wave classical definition strain mutating killing much people. 

We still first wave fortunately coronaviruses prone heavy mutational behaviour, sure know type coronavirus next. coronaviruses seem successful eluding immune system, especially watch reinfections (where worse outcome first time) analyse, happen happen individuals reinfections true second wave, first wave still rolling on. Yep, mass production up. Companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson Pfizer huge manufacturing capacity, Imperial College London partnered Morningside ventures plan vaccinate whole world, especially poor anti mask, anti passing law requiring masks state wide. Almost every county type ordinance mask wearing. need pass law that? takes certain stance dosen't mean deserves suffer beliefs. believe wife contracted first probably got infected home symptomatic.  still herd

Nice. Democratic hoax!! Keep buying Lone Stars screaming other's faces. Carry on... Congrats dumbass. China excluded COVAX initiative Rand Paul one 34,500 average since 2010-2011 flu season. number highly calculated unlike COVID far. It'll interesting see calculate final death burden Pandemic officially over. Suffice say, many times greater 34,500. already is. Work? life. know! People going like Oxford’s best isn’t even close. many companies (esp Pfizer Chinese ones) making better vaccines vaccine planned phased Imperial College London’s vaccine challenge trials might well stick election. either resign work Uncle Joe. puts whole ""first world country"" thing perspective. Really, realistically, take big players picture (Bezos forth, tip scales significantly), I'm sure we're different from, say, Zimbabwe Uraguay. 

Income inequality ridiculous here, sufficient skew measures. decent job, go far find big part people town can't actually pay rent afford food. let's even get health care...it's lot easier die navigate mess. path many take, willingly not. almost seems way design. rand Paul ignoring knowledge? medical degree duke father also doctor. even crazier him. pronounced colonel, highest rank military. relevant? I'll wait tell me. Cuomo’s idiotic law mandating patients infected coronavirus must return nursing homes, killed thousands people. tried crimes. full pay, week I'm simply quoting article. Make whatever associations want. Omg funniest thing I’ve seen day!🤣🤣 state's (Oregon) plan fully reopen vaccine fully reliable treatment. Definitely much better plan waiting zero cases sure. don’t think understand concept social contract.

I think reason say think it'll annoy me, notion relate last resort calling “piece schit” shows cannot carry reasonable discourse.

Did *have to*? That'd hard sell. I'd ask explain that, refuse also. that's excuse, anyway. know can't explain ""social contract"". carry reasonable discourse *all*, means surpassed there. 

When someone's ego attached rationality accuracy, size problem. someone's ego attached desire reconsider prior belief, *is* problem. determine point right everything would never question yourself?

If ever anger towards people lie public alter course social events, look mirror.

If read comments like mine think consideration subject lacking extreme, there's hope mind. become type hedonist bother thinking, least front people. corrupting influence. Trump knew. 100%. fuckin knew. Oh mean people strongly support trump? I'm hopeful leads milder flu cold season too. made people think otherwise? like needed study efficacy masks. reason, people abandoned common knowledge. Why? CFR quite meaningless. health experts frequently say. Idk get idea CFR matters, makes numbers look much worse really truly inspiring article. Thank posting. read ""Italy farting much better France, Spain, UK"" good. need take chill pill too. testing capacity limited, decide whether spend testing resources confirming recovered people. 

Many countries opted (in general case) instead give guidelines individual assess they’ve safely recovered. 

I think hospitalised patients confirmed free disease let go, may wrong. 

If add together cases confirmed last 2-3 weeks you’ll get rough estimate current case load minus recovered. CFR meaningless Oh no! Anyway... Delilaaaaaaaaaaaah! 

Got exhale long loud. Thanks!

Also wanna say appreciate you’re much. work daily data updates data consolidation really helped feel informed everything going down. really helped stay lot calmer. thanks that! Pronounced ""Misery"" effect. proud admit wrong gender race creed. Nobody likes feeling. really second wave US, longtail first. swear Sweden fucking wierd comes privacy stuff. know name someone learn adress, phone number, live value house simple search free website.

But reporting names criminals newspapers? Thats nono. vaccine great 3rd world countries, able give 1 shot, get second one amazing advantage, also able store warmer conditions competitors.


Most likely, Pfizer ones vaccinating US Pfizer getting type approval FDA November everything works out. Pretend over? Seems like people pretending never really existed. Lifted bootstraps. You’re comparing Chinese company China reporting healthcare social score controlled government. I’d imagine much easier time collecting data Google here. 

In US, we’re actively seeking obfuscate data diverting data away CDC HHS back CDC. Florida done particularly spectacular job forcing health department stop reporting data that’s reported years. study said men women BMI still worse results men, culprit cannot ""men obese"".

Certainly need better health campaign male obesity, that's enough here. also need better active Covid protections 62% vulnerable disease. followed orders Nope staline Europe. I'm recovering COVID, admit first bad night, pretty certain waking morning. trouble breathing, symptoms worse flu, COVID = DEATH message we've getting year already-anixiety-ridden self sure death sentence. know I'm alone either, people found house it, got calls &amp; texts family &amp; friends like crazy. So, *even say true*, spread disease others, completely oblivious harm they're causing, may still end long-term permanent lung, heart, liver, kidney brain damage.

And point ... ? still issue even without many icu visits deaths

why? *were already aware* mostly older aged cohort much risk bad covid cases.

Problem absolutely catch covid child younger person.

So, number young people cases goes up, likely eventually older, risk people wind catching otherwise would be.

This perfect example willfully ignoring chance save lives.

It's called ""precaution"" FFS Sure spread what? Fuck families jobs?
I guess everyone selfish regardless income levels whatnot. least fheir’s societal benefits though, unlike reopening bars first. you’re bad people spreading infection roommate got coronavirus girlfriend. started showing symptoms Tuesday. symptoms yet won’t get test results back Monday. last exposed Monday, worked Tuesday afternoon. wore mask gloves, working close contact one person. already told happened. also inform head work? don’t want worry nothing worry wasn’t contagious Tuesday. do?  pool boy Covid think die? We're actually framing covid recoveries bad guys disappointment now? Africa, French, mostly French, maybe England Americans one steal Africa.
I read lot Americans says always China, know Africa? Dallas here. area, people wearing masks (I’d say ~85%) still see anti-maskers almost anywhere. Businesses simply don’t want deal it. I’ve seen people start causing scene told bathrooms closed, etc.

However, “typical” Texas areas (basically anywhere outside Dallas) probably 50% masks, I’ve seen, one even tries enforce social distancing. Texas going remain hotspot many months. already happened though. congressman died staff using twitter account anti-masker Karens terrible masks are.

Those people exactly get messages. confirm, CU Boulder worst outbreak state CO right now. article definition click bait? impossible know many people cause people symptoms you, sir6, get dictate feel wasteful certainly get dictate opinions cannot post social media platform.

I didnt dictate that, maybe actually read people's posts instead continuing verbal diarrhea ad hominem strawman. know reading hard you, wrote bold - **You're free state opinion, like I'm allowed say completely idiotic opinion** man Zlatans comment source? Lol

It’s right wing talking point, one brought often /r/medicine. know statistical estimates? Adjust them. Countries nationalized healthcare astounding good data sets, ancillary benefit. teen Dorchester said racial things think got physical altercations (beat up?) Asian teens. don’t know ever apologized anything. Right makes sense, fair back college/university would going Good job sir Would recommend *1984* *Brave New World*? Yes. people raised racist views forced others learn later views false hateful. know much him, also believe (most) people redeemable. Also, crazy time appreciate kindness see world. Well airport losing money due less passengers, etc. free COVID test guarantees money gov't. Win them! scariest thing virus overlapped peak coronavirus months. still won’t another 3 months I’m dumbfounded Republican politicians think know COVID-19 virus doctor Fauci seen Trump Republicans politicians Dr. Fauci talking latest status COVID-19 pandemic giving Americans people advices deal Republicans constantly interruption say something entirely different Americans people watching constant confused telling truth unfortunately allows virus surge across America Covid something worse killing you. makes suffer.  fucking knew October. net worth SKYROCKETED since then. EVENT 201. Look up. could want police dogs specially trained 😂 Data suggests people virus give virus people without virus.  100% accuracy difficult achieve, 99% people virus dog sits around nothing. positive negative cases imbalanced, using metric (precision, recall, f1) would relevant. read article though. system change anytime soon.

In fact, doubt US system would ever reform without external pressure, countries *not* recognize Electoral College winner democratic vote loser. Exactly, terrible now. DOW good indicator all.

It's like using batting average say good baseball player is. Unfortunately yes. African’s facing less issues average population younger immune systems used fighting infections. It’s justify still going saying “it’s bad” Well, ""soon"" relative term, certainly expect keep wearing masks 9+ months future. still believe much western world could get vaccine mid-2021. issue getting vaccine third world another thing entirely. Sixty 80% population needs vaccinated develop antibodies natural infection achieve herd immunity, top World Health Organization officials said. 



Dr. Fauci added ""just record, Senator, 22% less 60% 80%."" Hamdemic that's different, going year work help environment.

Its fuckers must travel everywhere constantly vacations issue. People countries can’t afford another lockdown. Especially countries governments refuse help. experts point things shifting towards normality next year, hilarious think resolve restrictions get stronger time goes especially vaccine.

Oh tell, angelic ancestors?  issue pretending. genuinely, truly believe fake. And/or mildly symptomatic. It’s extremely simple question.

If put mask mandate place, would people alive right now? answer resounding yes.

Why didn’t put mask mandate place? would bad politically.

Ergo, let people meant protect die help politically. 

It’s really simple. Money money enough it. 

This third economic downturn adult life, I'm really happy that. Oh ....anyway.... GOOD DOGGOS!! 🐶😭🥰 hasn’t. stopped progress temporarily erased it. usually agree Mr Gates. case... 65 obese gives 1 5 chance death. know you, like odds. KnOW sEAsOnAL United States? I'm wondering like... could possibly authorized work President Computer order optimize code look glitches?

Because person essentially guy charge. typically travel S. America year. I'm photographer birder. I'm staying spending money places protect habitats endangered sensitive species animals. Yes flying bad environment, I'm trying part save stuff see. Without people like travelling place ton species animals would extinct right now. 

Now dummies fly halfway around world sit stupid resort get wasted definitely problem. knowledge gained confirming recoveries spending extra tests. died recover, simple that. 

Eventual complications studied following representative group recoveries based hypothesis worked there. infect others? sure comment mine, mean reply someone else? Yet large amounts people want school life go back normal. It’s selfishness. say? Never heard check... seems like (was?) racist scumbag indeed.

^(The guy lost eye service Vietnam War tho.) 90.000 infected, 5878 deaths, population 15 millions.
All Nordic countries together 137.000 infected, 7129 deaths, population 27 millions. think would easy dog actually carry virus. Think people virus live dog instances (that know of) dog carrying virus. suppose precaution would need taken terms keeping doggie clean minimizing amount people actually interact dog. Stuff like makes dream time relationship 4 legged friends respected more. Okay dog catches covid K, thanks. 

The first issue stated ""fiscal conservatism."" Trump literally least ""fiscally conservative"" president we've ever had. Moreover, clear trend Democrats reducing deficit Republicans greatly increase it, going back 40 years now. 

You also say would rather spending go towards people, corporations. There's clear difference parties candidates too, trump prioritizing giving money corporations (and friends, corruptly).

I understand favor Biden Trump, country mile, comes this.  Came say that. Wasn’t really obvious everyone? didn’t magically go away little Billy going 5th grade.  wife Teacher too. worry. 7 year old done great virtual learning, county virtual except kids special needs, internet options. switch hybrid person 3 weeks. concerned. child? Unlikely end hospital. 

The parent? Oh yes, article linked focused misunderstanding R0; it’s informative. Well that’s exactly reason moronic leadership. use simpler language emotion communication rather logic sophistication. actually watch debates candidates clearly reasonable way intelligent boring hell never get point across. _general_ public pretty uneducated going vote dude understood most. Vasectomy 22nd birthday, baby! Go airport get instant COVID love dogs 100% ok this! Here’s according Wikipedia-


DescriptionZlatan Ibrahimović Swedish professional footballer plays striker Serie club A.C. Milan. Ibrahimović widely regarded one best strikers generation. one decorated active footballers world, 31 trophies career. ounce prevention worth pound cure.

Hopefully plan students go home holidays. Leatherface. want disrespect snakes. one brought emission issue 1st accused flights 'pointless"". stay 1st topic? Alright Tonto, settle down. YIKES!!!!! never wish ill anyone.

But appreciate irony, hope misfortune serves warning others. Probably won't, one still dream silver lining black cloud. shutdown economy. CDC (ironically) actually discussion paper that’s worth reading think first messages Covid - must lockdown everyone die, bodies piled streets, complete collapse healthcare system, 5% fatality rate. patently false point, still accepted truth absurd number people. words - knowledge changed, ability general populace accept new information remarkably stunted. common occurrence crisis - ability disseminate new informational change views remarkably limited. saw article today. Thought might like it. [34 times Trump said virus would disappear need imagine. There's study fresh oven google determined risk death double get time (I think used hospital cases, still valid) Ideally, need good spoke person *under* scientific leadership, way around. It’s threads like turn antimasker Lol yeah ok bud, false equivalency big part reason distorted political incentives arising Electoral College. battleground states lean significantly right. US presidents govern center-right order win Electoral College. 

Democracy problem. Democracy works. Authoritarianism, alternative democracy, work. get corona, one nasty female. Plot twist: dog also spreading covid “close 100% accuracy”. expensive train service dog. train dogs living huge undertaking train type service dog rewarding. experience training cadaver dogs scent-work part would probably similar. many things train dog though, sniffin.

This article makes ridiculously happy. tools toolbox better get really emotional dogs able help humans significant ways. tell, means lot people dying. both? That's worst thing Go look numbers. still great. Doom gloom. Cases won’t stay flat. fluctuate. article. couldn’t believe read it. forcibly removed. people matter sex driven. Stop sexist maybe? Based experience flying Turkey last month, flights require take PCR test 72 hours flight however: Tests high false negative rate, even passengers take test allowed go board, take test landing (which means potential exposure flight). Masks mandatory, however: People take masks time attendants generally cowardly enforce rules. Several people coughed mask flight. basically resigned covid, assumed would get it. But... 3 weeks later symptoms. fact travelled turkey exposed sooooo many people, made sure wear mask always others generally giving fuck. fact get sick, made question easy actually get it... That's disgusting comment make genuinely ashamed Cool, *still* whataboutism matter many times y'all repeat it. data percentage college students test positive asymptomatic? article isn’t exactly clear this, read saying dogs detect virus 98% time, different thing saying they’re right general 98% time. disdain towards assumed left wing people palpable. governor iowa? sounds like something Covid Kim would say! really fun part kids still mostly taking crippling debt experience. US education system sure something! get choice continue distance learning? end year. releasing flights info seatings infected individuals? Yeah, certainly could see scenario Trump nukes capitol Toronto something Prime Minister says. Best hide Saskatchewan way even read long word let alone pronounce intelligibly. proof they're undercounting deaths? assume could look excess mortality. think appropriate age stop going nightclubs? bars? meet new people general? childish dance wedding, too? Oh yah, let call real quick...

You critique someone's actions simultaneously celebrating advocating die. again? ERASED. Notice article say anything hospital capacity??? testing finding cases. could test rate would caught people testing positive antibodies. really laughing loud here. 

This crescendo hobby epidemiology. 

Sorry mate, simply doesn’t cut it. said someone Canada Australia, NZ, sure. US? LOL

When comes Covid much better US -- 200k dead everything...

When comes concentration camps, sterilize Christian immigrants US sterilize Uighurs... hard tell difference really... edge cases everything. Nope people definitely saying wack ass shit like start think also take nose swab, make sure dog right started tests airport environment. quick that, least yet Sucks allergic. people could saved consistent messaging virus airborne. Ah yes, saying China may shining beacon light CLEARLY means I'm Russian asset read abstract, common, would good thing, right? Unfortunately, governments worldwide stressed distancing handwashing rather reality virus airborne n95 masks provide protection. Sweden's population 10 million. You’ll always chance getting Covid. Forever. No, really. trades men display egos everyday. year alone worked flat earthers, anti vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, ""plandemic"" enthusiasts. surrounded dumb. never knew dumb pandemic took off. showed low effort thinking was. ""I wear mask"". ""A mask pussies"". ""It's flu, can't handle flu?"" ""It's democratic hoax"". ""It affects sick people"". ""Kids get it"". recall anti science rhetoric, lot ego driven. Men likely die men take greater risks make poorer health choices. IMO ego driven. go. Weddings super spreader events. People want get married pandemic quietly small ceremony party next year pandemic over. Idk 3rd year went hard cos knew would never student environment again, big deal lot 3rd years party lot. Also memorable moment life made 1st year uni everybody footing, nothing compare.

And no, people leave hard partying / drugs culture university years unless want fail life. Also partying older nothing like partying town full students lol.

Why need explain this? cant relate convo pointless. IMO matter perspective neither us right wrong. hope recovers personal experience awakens health threat coronavirus poses Americans Missourians. Unfortunately, think change policies practices. link covid false positive rate statistics? Giant babies. can't trusted use masks, reason things closed. want open everything ""masks""? original plan!

Look mirrors, credibility. may right. outdoor events suspected superspreading events early days pandemic, famous soccer game Italy market Wuhan. Unfortunately, releasing specific enough information zip code based. Ideally, I'd like see BestBuy, CostCo, Safeway, restaurants etc confirmed cases. better.

Tell opposes masks. Odd experience may make sense...

When I'm sick dog cat usually bedroom. car lay bed day dog come out. 

When quarantined covid, lived basement wife would bring food bottom stairs head back up. animals never came except cat, shitbox there. stayed close wall come near me. started 3 days got positive... odd hell... Maybe works lab setting use Labradors instead police dogs. remember everyone said goal flatten curve prevent hospitals getting overwhelmed.

i member advice get tested go (wait week come back false negatives). Healthcare plays role seen disease mostly body responds virus matters. end draw unlucky card cytokine like storm reaction combined clotting many things best healthcare prolong suffering. thing “semi-automated-mass-Training system” sadly never be. dog different one training plans different. Bomb dogs also typically cost significantly $10k. army routinely spend $90-100k bomb dog Well lot places offer free. sure making heaps profits. Yikes.... apply write unconfirmed rumors. hospitals abnormal amount flu-like symptoms even declining hospitals bed capacity , write impunity won’t anything.

Also plenty legislators who’d happy play whistleblower even smallest cases Well first off, I'd like see many apartments New York central heating dont think uncommon believe.

But second, speculation. Studies proven moves pretty effectively air conditioning systems. 

Also 22% New York state Covid neighborhoods infection rights upwards 60-70% basically microcosm herd immunity. Mitch McConnell COVID Detector-General. Oh, means, show evidence outdoor gatherings - widespread mask use distancing (widespread, universal) - cause huge outbreaks. Plenty cities enormous protests spikes. NYC, Chicago, etc please, let stop blaming BLM boogeyman. Hospitals supposed implode two weeks never happened 

Either paying attention basing everything local experiences. hospitals came point crashing lot places. 

And stop martyr ""They're lying generate fear!"" BS 
 Everybody knows young people asymptomatic, problem spread others safe. 

And again, cherry-picking stats love, regardless relevance. New Hampshire low population density travelers compared to, say, Boston.  Again, I'm disuputing numbers low (they're rising, maybe/hopefully get control) - even numbers going back business-as-usual. Spacing required restaurants (again, means real terms capacity limited) I'm guessing there's concerts big theater gatherings allowed yet either. He's dead, died insanity, I'd say least bumps 7.5 Yeah, is.

There two options: 

1) Take active measures prevent spread virus ultimate goal eradicating population.

2) Allow spread continue (slowed not) enough population developed immunity virus.

Sweden chose second option. expressly said goal merely *slow* spread, without taking measures designed stop it. default ""herd immunity"" strategy.

New Zealand (for example) chose first option. took active measures stop spread COVID-19 result nation half population Sweden 40 times fewer cases, 120 times fewer deaths. Twice took measures halt spread virus, twice succeeded within weeks, resulting people much (if more) freedom last 6 months Sweden... nearly zero cases deaths. Thank nonetheless! Prepare get downvote nuked criticizing masks maths simple, show us model? big advantage dogs they're cheap portable. way!!

Just means huge problem people's pensions lot less children anticipated. society prefers capitalists, instead work force, that's that.

Seriously, feel responsible build something environment anymore. greed corruption unfathomable. New York State 30% fatalities per capita *country* planet. virus hit multiple countries Asia Europe, hit Washington state New York. Cuomo busy pissing contest Bill DeBlasio pay attention.

I don’t care poorly Trump done, amount revisionism going excuse Cuomo failures this. I'm seeing lot overlap certain candidate's campaign event locations.

Sad, mobile game better response fictional pandemic reality does... days **few** week**s** get results.

FTFY. Accusations ad hominem really rich coming you. 3.6 Sanities. great, terrible. It’s crazy. mean guess people making split second decisions taking one day time jeez. 
Wait comes back someone else sends sick kid effects them. Different story bet. one gives crap ethics Dump administration. We're gonna CCCP soon anyway - we'll get vax. drone kill anyone lol Exactly this. Screening rare condition fraught issues non-intuitive. mean positive results false. Well, large events anywhere starters. order food drink bar also pretty asinine. Masks anywhere everywhere. “reserve spot” everything gyms hiking. Little stuff like adds up. better wait get colonies mars moon.  can't stop society this. people understand that? 

Corona fucking get jail free card year. still pay rent, still work. Nothing changed best, taking precautions get sick. 

So tired people like, ""oh quit job stopped going cause coronavirus need free checks government, plus rent paid, plus food stamps, plus legal obligations go away."" 

But why? ""Oh well son/daughter/mother/father immunr compromised need year life paid for"" 

Than find out, really immune compromised doctor. Oh no, always self diagnoses. blocked article Thank you, misunderstood. believed China release genotype months. need check facts post something inaccurate. Thank clarifying this! takes one overexcited dogo diagnosed 4 different cancers aids once. precaution-deniers ones actually saying ridiculous things, like ""bodies piled streets"", attributing anonymous ""other"" despise.

Literally definition strawmanning. What? Chinese propaganda told china already vaccine? would lie that?

It's odd China time line usa vaccine supposed come out.

But, china need vaccine controlled outbreak well zero infections china? board full Chinese BOTs people love show Doomsday Preppers. go, im full 20% time dog gets right 100% time. lol. Sort of. complex issue. 

My primary source stuff Podcast [This Week affiliated American Society Microbiology, hosted top virologists US. 

There two issues going here:

1. [false positive phenomenon actual cases disease population low, even extremely accurate test generate false positives true positives. example, test 99% accurate, 2% population actually infected, roughly half positive tests actually false positives. problem currently places like NYC low percent population actually infected. Luckily orthogonal testing methods solve problem (e.g. using two types tests, testing second time people positive test results). 

2. Perhaps bigger problem comes SARS-CoV2 detection concept positive. current gold-standard RT-PCR tests extremely sensitive, detect small viral loads. great diagnosis screening. person small viral load likely contagious (either recently infected, infected long time). person test positive covid19, even long past infectious stage disease. aim screen people whether infect someone else, false-positive. Another problem PCR tests take least day give results, often much (my sister gets tested regularly job NYC takes two weeks get results back- point completely meaningless). 

It's argued many epidemiologists scientists effective way control pandemic use less sensitive cheaper rapid-acting tests. tests sensitive small viral loads, accurate someone enough virus body actually contagious. Therefore if, example, wanted go school, could test morning, get result 15 minutes, test negative reasonably sure safe go out. requires frequent (~daily) testing effective. Here's site info idea: Cool anecdote, actual data shows US leader testing 4th tests per 100,000 fucked reddit wants think. research saying can't get again.

It's virus, evolve. That's get different fli shot every year.

If look deaths per population, US one top numbers.. know would think makes seem less deadly... Wow, sounds nerve wrecking. Glad seem past worst it. fellow American, know mean. afraid politicians removing pre-existing conditions care coverage, health care general expensive it’s effectively unable accessed lot people anyway. 

I heard mostly gastro impacted seem better outcomes, say. made wonder people may gotten virus though mouth somehow. Maybe doesn’t chance set shop lungs quickly.

I wonder eat fresh vegetables fruit sometimes. rinsed, never really disinfected. decided early eating fresh fruit veg years would impact health ways, take bit risk amells like COVID That's whole point, people 18 grown generally immature selfish, fuckin hell, wake pay attention conversation. would think Herman Cain could’ve one death. Former Presidential candidate. Probably got attending Trump Rally... great man. God watch him. Biology often quite good dies, can't replicate technology. Maybe ate virus instead inhaling it. Lol. one pandemic spot already taken! Who'da thunk double pandemic!?! Tough shit? one brought kid world, time actually take care CHILD. sympathy parents losing said minds fact crotch fruit.

Poor teachers. rand paul eye doctor. may know stuff infectious disease, much anthony fauci like explosive sniffing dogs see airports

Yeah, dogs explosive! sniffing great, first time one sneezes blows people up, bad. Thank you. kind relevant know evaluate real risk public transportation people wearing masks.  spread people outside campus duh. Yep yep. clear, way thinking, three acts are:

Act 1 - covid spreads worldwide. begin learn works, kills, symptoms. Initial lock downs effect places weather initial fears medical system overwhelmed.

Act 2 - covid becomes part daily life, neither becoming apocalyptic pandemic vanishing, resentfully persisting disrupting daily life. Therapeutic treatments vaccines developed.

Act 3 - treatments vaccines deployed. risks infection drop due treatment vaccines begin significantly reduce viral spread. Covid slowly eliminated life returns normal. summer, Nordic countries go vacation enjoy outdoors. Sweden latitude Alaska. people keep ignoring basic fact gathering indoors controlled climates issue, keeps amazing me. expect keep wearing masks 9+ months future

I'll put alongside pigs flying, politician honest hell freezing over. Masks dropped next spring, that's optimistic.    Medical professionals work proven ill people day properly wearing N95 masks. cases close face contact, face shield. usually get sick. N95 mask effective barrier properly used.

The risk exposed room wearing N95 approximated, less 1% per day. like kind probability often roll dice sooner come craps. student high risk group, live someone is? That's probably bigger consideration factor. reward worth risk? juice worth squeeze? people get vaccinated things get relaxed gradually, we’ll close normal fully April bit later. Well you? 18? third year college students? lol cause change constantly depending dumb point wanna make. That's World War Z detect people infected. diagnosed years ago OCD control now.
So trying add humour post. understand suffering extreme anxiety manifests various forms OCD must hard.

For extra controls easy understand many they’re upsetting want cause offence post using past OCD experiences humour 😊 sexist? Men dying twice rate women. Men risk takers. Yup  spike cuz schools reopening? could predicted this!? wife student cough directly face today. student persistent cough week. parents sent despite getting COVID test. I'm probably gonna get COVID.

We simply can't trust schools/parents adhere rules unless become MUCH strict.  Welcome chronic illness. Enjoy stay. Good news 0 hospitalizations SUNY campuses since they've reopened.

LOL, post good news get downvoted. Never change r/Coronavirus cocaine! herd immunity based natural R0, without temporary protective measures. 

Again, show one source, anywhere, considers fully-locked-down society considered ""herd immunity"". 

You simply using term incorrectly.  that, fucks *you* over, too.

The school teach student come class yesterday fever. Mom sent kid want kid home, thought could get away it. Thankfully, kid admitted feeling good teacher sent COVID room campus mom come pick up.

Now kid *has* home least two weeks. Good going, mom. said we’d “dealing” COVID while, sure, shutdowns lockdowns presented temporary measure nearly government officials. wish folks realized issues false positives likely causing low prevelance areas. Pretty sure forgave too. Piece shit. don’t get getting downvoted, celebrating death someone isn’t better actions said person. aren’t wild savage animals (at least try be) let’s act better idiot anti maskers remembered, around bad flu years get asked ***either*** get flu shot wear mask ... 

This year it’s avoid people getting anticipate life-threatening. 

The Gov Massachusetts initially wanted make flu shots mandatory state-wide public schools, walked back raised din. What's blood 25(oh) levels? That's anti maskers using incorrectly. Take breath, turn Reddit Facebook minutes, go walk. very, doable, working frenzy help. yea plane 16 ICU patients, thats small scale, bet worse winter germany may free bed then, see Someone needs learn exponential growth. yes, come line intelligent people. Population brainfart, sorry, rest Swedish think sound way this, whatever viruses germs die 7 days. die people? makes sad. couple hundred thousand dogs handler each? Debbie downer really feasible. agree actions better related past. act like irrelevant mark's racist past. donated Asian community tried help anti Asian rhetoric, that'd indicative trying make amends. Teachers staff dont magically lower hospitalization rate adults. laughed Yea get getting at. found hilarious extremly small town got mentioned coronastrategy thread.

For fun facts. actually happened largest workplace LKAB ""repstopp"". Two week long maintenance brings People sweden, ofcourse great idea pandemic. pay extremly good sick People showed up, went mayhem ended highest per capita cases sweden. assure closing bathhouse library ment nothing actual pandemic. Tegnell made sure ill advised stayed misinformed arrogant towards anything shutdown related. What's difference? all-time best
seller! Yeah think last point important. people retail/high exposure jobs young people. Cashiers, restaurant workers, etc. people spend 40+ hours week exposing general public. It’s unreasonable expect go immediately home quarantine. perspective, they’re already exposed large amounts work, might well fun. Governments responsible limiting spread, blaming people trying keep sane insane time Done certain age drive, smoke drink etc country? Maybe even biology 101. Sorry, corrected still think airborne means ‘travels airplane’, huh? no, not. know someone fairly severe ocd they're rough time this. Dawg you’re trying correct really hard, appreciate without animosity behind it, re-word said, mean exact thing...? Since positive test result equivalent death? basically back middle ages large masses people dont even believe microorganisms. Pff, genuinely think women taken seriously healthcare?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lol dude I’d take Bush administration point Look, term “herd immunity threshold” typically used epidemiological community determine vaccination requirements. It’s defined 1 - 1/R0 fraction required vaccinated reduce Rt 1. jargon translate well casual usage. Additionally, R0 particular place time; immutable frozen value March 1, 2020.

There’s question primary reason Rt 1 anywhere containment measures. There’s also question Rt also reduced immunized population. place like NY, behaviors probably 75% work unsusceptible population 25%. way inflammation average man I'm male. Fantastic. member? That's Canada, University College students transfered classes learning online home. Yes, still coughing intense last night. I’ve arguing morning getting tested. right seem transmission dogs issue, viruses mutate quickly always change  Welcome third world stock market housing market. continue boom :) It’s response care preserving economic system saving lives. Herd immunity never strategy Sweden.

* Chronic Non-Responder. one. sound bit fishy "" fever, followed cough muscle pain, nausea vomiting diarrhea "" found one English Fat Emperor using Tegnell anti lockdown doubt that’ll case tbh. same. really hope develop better way lessen/negate effects allergy. know allergies get shots, that’s long procedure, usually 3 5 years. one woman could smell person Parkinson disease. WW2, 18-22 year olds enlisted voluntarily en masse fight fascism. rest country went without essential goods via rationing help fight fascism. 

Forgoing parties semester sucks, it’s bare minimum sacrifice. well good dogs detect it. many cases dogs miss? data that? older adults setting great example. Let's motorbicycle rally point reckless college kids. 

I'm saying kids blamed important keep perspective; problem around, good bad actors every group. 

If sliver leadership even unified message, hey, sheeps gonna sheep Lul:

“have fun last 4 years real world ...”

Believe me, anyone stopped fun left college wrong. article read days ago claimed  dogs need 10-100 particles order smell covid, test needs millions. least most. Well nobody’s immune system alarm clock goes exactly 12 months. If, say, 90% COVID survivors 12 months immunity re-infection, we’d expect see we’re seeing — slow trickle confirmed re-infections around 6-month mark (i.e. outliers short end), followed gradual increase see lot re-infections around 14-month mark. course, time get we’ll probably rolling vaccine. Maybe needs annual shot like flu, work turn annual annoyance.

The worst case scenario people like 3 months immunity, would society-ending implications came effectiveness vaccine even natural herd immunity. already know we’re living scenario. Guess keeps trying falsely slam healthcare system isn’t America’s... 

Remember it’s poorly coronavirus “socialist healthcare kills!” ? Where’d talking point go? Well, college town, 60% infections currently 18-24, since mid August. also ban gathering (ANY gathering regardless age) 10 people less indoors, 50 people less outdoors), patrols student areas. 

Our case count also around 225 every two weeks. Low, one wants like schools 1000-1500 now. hospitals excellent shape want stay way. yeah, better silver bullet. need broad variety treatments, vaccines, preventative measures. variety options means get use multiple manufacturing distribution channels, treatment vaccine unsuitable people, options. worth try! I'm sure there's contact us CDC page something Note I’m pretty sure positive tests reported diagnosis confirmed- clinicians epidemiologists understand concept base rate fallacy. 

If idea frequent rapid antigen-based testing large scale resonates encourage write local national representatives encourage get board programs. misunderstand arrive figure. 
Drug sniffing dogs 99% accuracy detect one person hundred walks past bag coke them. know name someone learn adress, phone number, live value house simple search free website.

I think information also know names criminals newspapers? Thats nono.

is thing. Thanks intelligent analysis!! People need think beyond case numbers understand what's actually generating numbers. feel like % tests returning positive hospitalizations accurate measurements outbreak severity course not. saying science product society much influenced. example, supported hydroxychloroquine, others not, supported remdesvir, studies not, support vitamin D, others not. Science clear cut. like that. Oh look, sources. Maybe taken precautions right wing govt considering lockdown denying problem months. voted competent party. Modern day hunger games. stopped? pretty bad prisoners. locked cell prolonged periods really hard mental health, too. Probably better dying Covid, still detrimental. Here’s CDC  always like say. Three types lies kids - Lies, Damn Lies, statistics They’ve tested 19,400 teachers 65 positive. It’s article. rollout hits device, able press ""layer"" button switch ""COVID-19"" view re-color map. feature rolls worldwide Android iOS starting week. told Greece vents masks longer allowed. I'd take dog sniff test brain swab day! Relatively hospitalizations deaths, however. Sure, people already dropping masks around live, pragmatic sense still make sense least sizable portion population chance get vaccine numbers go somewhat rare again. nice see someone admit, made mistake understood something wrong! hats you! smells like human bad breath, much intense. beef Tsai? mistakes made her? That's fair argument. I'll take day. 

But find argument true rate Sweden (way) lower test rate problematic. 2 reasons:

Most positive cases caught Denmark asymptomatic (or caught early). given test volume hardly surprising. think fair assumption true positivity test positivity pretty much (0,7-1%). follows half argument, less. 

But disagree second half. Though less, 140.000 tests per week still fairly large test volume call different strategy such. find difficult believe sample biased point invalidating argument. might estimate number swedes may hesitant get tested feeling sick. agree we're ahead inclination get tested. much. 

But still, expectation Sweden fair number asymptomatic cases untested. People feeling sick, probably younger people. Denmark higher chance getting tested enter stats. 

So rather shitty science we're stuck different assumptions (which tested eventually): believe swedish true rate (much) lower test rate - don't. media downplays serious issues. That's really tuned beginning, knew would big deal. wish wrong. year sucked Yes nations would totally try step antagonize Trump, man wondered nuking hurricanes, absolutely gains whatsoever.

Not like Hitler Germany precedent nations vs domestic concentration camps... Even crazy dude started *invading* countries strong detente impulse... reporting names criminals newspapers? Thats nono.

I believe phrase “innocent proven guilty”. Convicted criminals usually afforded discretion suspected criminals are, mind be, left unnamed. We're talking generations talking teachers staffers immediate vicinity would-be vectors. true.  mass spectrometer setup far selective sensitive dogs nose.  like cameras better eyes. lol what? would argued broke wikipedia. That's bad info part. get N95's valve. saying let plane fucking n95 mask? Wrong. author article posted believes true longer participate dutch society? accept. would like escort border flying out? guess depends define “anti masker”

I see used countries still massive increase infection, almost Scandinavian countries low numbers.

Masks complement, free-fix solution. people get tired panicked time. population realized big deal majority them, want get lives. weeks months ago.. thousands still unaware of. Work die. even then, may still die take bunch people us. least owner gets keep doors open profits rolling in! related topic? epidemiologist?   Even Biden wins, he’s going anything would alleviate problem. neoliberal status-quo. Don’t get hopes up. lmao nice whataboutism. idk I'm arguing someone paid CCP. good luck trying brainwash americans. maybe post YouTube? oh wait, banned 😂 tell difference speech comparing experienced educated scientist vs experienced BS politicians grabbing stringing BS thin air. need intelligent people stand call idiots publicly. deep viral science. even basic idea herd immunity is. amazes many dont understand Doctonk I’m kid. I’m responsible adult understands accountability. Smithfield owned Chinese. seem fun. Teaching kids good little capitalists. Always put interests children's governments needs help make sure corporations make profits Uncle Sams bottomless pit gets fed. kids lifetime debt pay mention kids grandkids. Maybe something crazy attendance rules. remember went care grades, number days pass. lmao gottem I'm shocked this. shocked, say. would imagined anyone would thing.

Oh wait, people protesting masks, never mind.  Well guess we’re see happens state isn’t even trying control virus, don’t immunity, 5 10 times deadly influenza.  Yeah same. mom dying breast cancer. get see get married we've cancelled wedding. would incredibly selfish wedding pandemic, even invited immediate family would still 20 people. Sucks, sacrifices made save lives, especially can't endanger family like that. 

I hope everything works one ends spreading wedding! Good luck! I;m jealous! Wow study epidemiology? Florida reports two metrics.

1. Deaths case date (actual date death) low daily

2. Deaths reported Dept. Health reported large cumulative blocks numbers. 

The reported 200 daily deaths #2. Sorry, thought originated Brazil. I'm sure change it? survives without complications strengthening case. None antimask politicians claiming can't get infected, rather risk serious illness virus little none. don’t want mild case he’ll double stupidity aware. say FFCRA.

The post responded spoke taking FMLA unpaid. clarified FMLA never paid itself. Federal Act provides job protection, lost wages due medical LOA. FFCRA temporary addenda ACT (by definition beyond normal scope FMLA enacted). Hope motorcycle super spreader event worth Spreadnecks* SHOWME-Vid happening American government care health families live work there. got email youngest school they've open 2 weeks traditional classes already student sent last Thursday tested positive. shut stated child contact child nurse would sending additional email. Thankfully decided we'd continue virtually high risk members family. Death rate suggests decline cases result shitty testing rather decline disease.

Same way membership drug cartel ""suggests"" inclination solve business disputes violence. He’s asymptomatic yeah probably won’t change much views things. I'm shocked Yeah. problem trying make good faith call “sick” “symptoms.” sons seasonal allergies. woke morning allergy symptoms, kept home. We’re supposed keep daycare symptoms go away. supposed load children’s Zyrtec keep home allergy season over?? supposed manage jobs?? kept home today. Even got Covid test 3, there’s guarantee school readmit him. Backup care isn’t going come take care symptomatic kid. Sounds like chiropractor. countries Covid 19 spread controlled? respond differently, outcome achievable.. someone think businesses???   Damn, ordering correct. correct. know??? fact says logic could applied flu, something deadlier MUCH contagious, silly. 0 deaths per day, near it, realistic states counties willing put forth effort lockdown, testing tracing efforts. don’t like wish death upon anyone boy would sure karmactic justice Flu deaths Texas past decade hovered 2000-4000 according CDC. GMO viruses? want naturally-grown one!

/s would talk about? Say people died dumbass. can’t outside space sanctified? Aren’t cemeteries sacred ground Catholics? Hence ban suicides buried consecrated cemeteries? Ive read still six figures per week even pandemic. also doesnt take foreign invaders create spike infections. takes dad needing get fresh hair cut grandpa needing beer pub. months cooped inside truly blame them, even though know damn well virus rises again. friend mine says, ""Humans gonna human. prepare human humanning, act accordingly"" also went school Midwest graduated 2012. always nurse office help out. came close losing shit today. don’t blame him. Rand Paul obviously anti science/pro Trump agenda. medical experts. believe Cdc lot political influence White House. qualify losers suckers? can’t run casino company without declaring bankruptcy anyone surprised this?"
