0,2020-08-08," Goddammit America. They’re....the thing....... Well, one plus side hesitancy far closer COVID vaccine be, simply COVID vaccine partially based SARS vaccine trying make since hit nearly 20 years ago. early process already done we're close endgame anyway Anyone know many children transmitting COVID-19 adults? Really want know numbers here. Oh god sorry!! thought guy originally replied lol

But hey...there’s link everyone read! enough money know. literally claims both. I’m kidding. debates year gonna interesting. Old dumbass evil dipshit vs. cranky old creepy guy. set PayPal account? There's excuse digital age. Well he's running guy let pandemic run rampant America, hates blacks mexicans, thinks Confederacy legitimate. people understand either fear get angry it. used many big words hurt feelings. well you’re wrong...and I’m sure sarcasm self aware? And... 200 countries dealing virus, fit ""well-orchestrated plan""? whole thing conspiracy psychology 101 -- major world events happen, people desperate need manufacture equally big explanation them. can't lone gunman killed Kennedy. can't Princess Diana simply accident. can't virus.  mother caught strep throat probably dozen times kid getting (not exaggerating; got automated truancy notice elementary school many days sick, one case progressed scarlet fever required ER visit... curiously, commenced virtual school, caught strep every great while). She’s... rather unhappy school situation. might nuts lot political stuff related virus, remarkably clear agreeing absolutely result lot dead kids. lmao There’s growing mountain evidence showing COVID-19 dangerous even doesn’t affect much, likely spread cause damage. It’s like you’re taking large risk avoid mild unpleasantry. You’re taking small risk, grand scheme things, avoid pervasive dangerous disease. fucking surprise, holy shit that’s staggering amount *The elderly newly destitute longer able afford basic necessities medicare social security quickly run funding. starting look optimistic, one month later. Well apologize misread it. agree completely. Laois. significant rise cases, dozens, past weeks, we've still awaiting mass testing results local direct provision centres meat factories. 5 cases 178 reported today community spread. It’s they’re stupid Well able enlighten I’m willing learn ... in-laws keep telling husband (not front me) need send kids school opens because:

“It’s like flu”
“They need build immune system”
“Kids aren’t affected badly”
“No kids died it”

I don’t understand think things. 

Btw, we’re distance learning Lol Yay, can’t wait educators die sake economy. Fuck shit, scared go back classroom. disagreé war deaths, lots wars internal rebellions killed far people 19th century. revolts minority Dom Pedro II example, one north, Sabinada Balaiada don’t remember, killed 200.000 people one third Amazon population. 7 billion people planet. basically 2.5 cents per person... 

I know. Seems like PR thing. never said did? changed conversation haha. ok? people simply privilege choice.

If parent keep roof head kid's head, fuck supposed do? Leave six seven year olds home alone go school feed themselves? Yeah. won’t end real Covid. number people usually die US every year likes heart disease (650,000 2019 alone) completely AWOL year. Homicides etc down, road accidents. Where’s that? Given search reporting methodologies changing week ago Texas... well. believe US stats conduct basic job reporting fatalities properly even third world country manage. “We students staff reporting presumptive, pending positive COVID-19 tests every day, continue operate schools pandemic,” said. “We working Department Public Health confirm, contact trace, quarantine notify school community.”

There isn’t going anyone left! don’t understand absurdity. close down, shits hot rn. Sucks can't get vaccine. hopefully two things happen. get N95 masks back stock, I'd imagine 1/3rd wearing anyways, leaving vulnerable freely get them. Businesses schools require vaccine, obv businesses can't require customers to, workers. refuse, well free country, go get another job private school. Facebook facts go unchecked determined likes Doesn’t work brand. reason politicians sides isle keep wearing one press events.

They want see face connect saying name face. Absolutely. country greedy be. can’t even say dumb. know exactly they’re doing. Kids need home now. prepare future school. going future school help?

Hey kids! can't friendly neighbourhood spiderman neighbourhood...... is.  Everyone news feed FB gets flu shot every year says hell get vaccine. even know exactly (because one now) sure bad. idea knew many people completely unreasonable pandemic. scary.  Sorry, definitely don’t want you, matter good may Glad Georgia test group rest us. #Heroes. /s Exactly. point isn’t taking away handled virus. It’s keeping virus it’s contained much easier said, who’s sneaking NZ? Ironically influencers actually figured make work. School Superintendant : We've tried nothing we're ideas.

Tbf, he's actually done everything make worse, including stopping teachers implementing protective measure. know bit topic, kids back school already? still summer break? going back early due COVID, common thing Georgia? Mr. Trump, feel good . . . 

Day life Avenger America teenage kid 

Poof Yeah, Fauci talking day. saying people thinking vaccine everything back normal mistaken. 100% effective we'll still need things like social distancing masks slowly reduce numbers. They’re special attention whores though, kind whore peoples’ attentions. Post data. Read response sample done. Kiddo. It’s already flattened lot latest surge past peak. Sorry don’t like data. suggests prefer see suffering denial. Nothing said changes free speech works. yeah hope impact global society, next generation, deserves it, end better leaders her. Yes. That’s precisely believe based actual data. based puerile “lol” comments youngsters posting inane headlines clueless newspapers. Read — 

Lancet, evidence Australia evidence Netherlands, Israel.. (sending kids school negative effects epidemic growth) 

Switzerland (Schools started reopening May 11th account 0.3% transmissions could traced, two likely 

UK
The Times report U.K. quotes Prof. Woolhouse, chairman infectious disease epidemiology Edinburgh University, saying school-age kids ‘minimally involved epidemiology virus.’ adds youngsters ‘vanishingly unlikely end hospital die it’ ‘rarely transmit” virus others.’” list goes on. 

What got, kiddo? Every article recent March 2020 says drives cheap car. Doesn’t mention anything driver. 

Anyway, point cheap car, regardless driving. feel like school would suspend kids testing positive petty. deeply negative opinion school administrators (not teachers though) fact real people crazy shit followers watch ads see pretty much says they’re real.

Maybe followers, most. Part problem hyper politicization, especially right. Seeing Obama, center-left pragmatic President, attacked insane reasons (the brown suit, dijon mustard incidents come mind), easy connect dots. made scandal absurd stuff, denied twisted facts presented opposition (Benghazi, anyone?), logical step. 

And one anything ""everyone entitled opinion,"" even facts used false, opinion offensive. anti intellectual population country long past gotten hand. Sarcasm detected, suspended young man Oh look that, course got downvoted. yeah, would absolutely take South Korean Japanese vaccine Chinese one. would still prefer European American vaccine stand still. First nothing comment implied suffering.i made life choices I'm best can.I trying trump anything. comment tone def people actually need help. dont option luxury work home.who need public school system continue job. Yes asshole I'm one construction trash types looked upon. say said. absolutely study said lack reading comprehension. Stop spreading lies. got 'social isolation bad folks!' circlejerk. many give someone will? know. There's lot want say say take care Oxford passed safety trials way corona, Moderna working technology since 2012 “It’s vodka?”

“Always been.” Yes, experts make mistakes within subject areas, far lower rate non-experts. following advice many experts topic isn’t guaranteed correct, it’s likely correct lacking expertise topic. vaccines carry level risk, almost carry much less risk disease trying immunize from. almost medical professionals recommend taking vaccines , risk:reward ratio heavily favour. countries also ignore science like americans doing. Wife lost 65 lbs colon cancer surgery. Mainly due TPN, lack normal nutritive substance: significant weight loss.  can't think American news network mediocre best tbh... Mine imagining 100% effective vaccine, like polio. flu vaccine may 50% effective. Even less obese. interesting jump conclusion right-wing. 

All I'm saying...as mentioned comment below, instead saying fuck - ""I hate F country""...why get involved local politics? 

Put money mouth is, take chances pandemic jump plane tropical island chill fuck relax. 

It's easier play video games &amp; talk shit behind keyboard raise money, get &amp; knock neighbor's doors, fight cause believe in... right wing left wing moderate whatever F want call it. 

Keep positive, keep self 🙉🙈🙊 Except media use worldometers, use John Hopkins University.  is. gone April. /s Ok gotcha, it’s still surprising. necessarily. last flu season relatively mild, iirc, fair corona-deaths may people would died then. that's mom got covid deserves upvotes. good. People residences using way TP usual, sheltering place. shift production around accomodate that. packaging distribution channel non-residential TP (used restaurants, offices etc) separate consumer chain non-consumer TP mostly make retail stores, due UPC codes, many dozen rolls box, etc. panic buying, even short supply.

Anyway, expect home TP consumption still higher usual, industry caught up. see thing masks. Lots new production facilities brought online now. enough first place showed terrible lack foresight. like army running bullets 1 week invasion. heading towards flattening COVID way. Maybe amount people still living. wish true. Mine certain. I’ve vigilant safety won’t even let mom over. Sadly can’t vouch she’s been. 
I’m seeing many kids still sleepovers pool parties playing damn park neighborhood. unfortunately live area thinks whole think “a fucking joke” one belligerent neighbor shared standing middle street. 
Oh local water slide park open despite told open. said anything China. Asian countries, South Korea, would trust. grandma tested positive coronavirus makes fucking mad see people like swear see one people public Christmas December?

During administration, every time high-ranking resignation, mass exodus “Friday Night Massacre” (we’re 5 now?), cradled face hands muttered, “what fuck” myself. 

I driving heard withdrawal Paris Accord firing Mueller drew visceral reactions pull over, park sit. 

I WANT NOTHING DECISIONS! live consequences. 

I’m pretty numb now. Teaching isn’t going happen fall, getting teaching contract right impossible district, contract offered it’s smarter teachers jumped ship knowing district playing fast loose safety. 

I’ve protested, racist neighbors make sure klan survives protected like “BLM terrorists” right to. Everything wrong protected winning, nothing good come it. fuck percentage color like that? version capitalism involve greed? 1 4 working americans currently receive zero paid vacation days zero paid sick leave days. care amount riders. amount drivers dropped significantly. driver myself, making fucking bank that. Usually 6 hour night I'd make $120. 6 hour night makes $250. I'm loving it. careful... Thats deferral, cut. people pay back January one blow. Literally would getting $0 without bill passed Congress. I'm saying, patience engage political rants. good one. Much media reports it.
In news looks like sweden continued normal. criticizes. lives know thats true.. soft lockdown recommendation changed way lived. (And still does). long list recommendation swedes try follow them.

Even CNN admit it’s “surprisingly “ helpful. could something like happen./s “I mean, really can’t enforce kids wear masks. mean, there’s *no way* we’ll see results-

##hEY- HEY, MISSY! INCH SHOULDER SEE?? ASS GOING HOME DAY, SEE WHORE COLLARBONES FLAUNTING AROUND HALLS AGAIN, IT’S SUSPENSION-

Uh, I? Oh, ha, yeah, right. anyways, really don’t see viable way make kids wear masks-“ Nice Where’ve been? live literal center Wisconsin, city Wausau. hate living idiocracy, closed minded, backwards thinkers here. hey science.... yeah... dont teach anymore.... google ""____ coronavirus cases"" Isabel option 2 days school keep child home distant learning. much would suck I’m really leaning distant learning. seems there’s least one similar article every day. Texan here. Every college know shutting down. Idk highschool's though No. 20 times likely need hospital care infected relative adults. equal distribution total number assumed. means ratio hospitalized children/infected children 1:20 relative hospitalized adults/infected adults. glad Hong Kong able higher testing capacity that's takes deal recent outbreak area.

On personal level, got folks HK I've quite worried working overseas. greed capitalism. Plenty money fix this, that's gonna happen.

You mean capitalism. kid supposed confirmation ceremony couple weeks, complete retreat weekend celebratory breakfast follow. got group notification breakfast one person rsvp'd 11 people. immediate family 8 others. We're like yeah... enjoy pancakes. See ya next year, maybe. hate put us position say ""no"" instead right thing postponing confirmation. say stole election, that's false narrative gives much power. He's unqualified asshole he's one guy. hordes supporters put there. Less half voters admittedly still almost half. people scream ""USA!"" loudest ironically ones setting us fail. That's always cringe ""stole election"" ""they want voters dumb"" conspiracies. That's movies. unfortunate reality fellow countrymen themselves. crazy me, claim love country much happily, willingly, keep shooting foot. [not mention attendees appear many pre-existing conditions correlate poor covid-19 results.]

Keep eye good post covid 19 bike deal. think funny time massive unemployment economic uncertainty millions, suggestion go vacation/move. put dope interact average person clear head, sound exceedingly touch. 💨💨💨 Right like wtf fuck changes wha noticed number deaths going up... yup let’s go back fire, best luck! Cops mostly busy beating kidnapping protestors behave like benevolent peace-keepers. 

Enforcing local legislation benefits public health directed science medicine apparently radical. cares number globally. It’s anything control many parts Australia, it’s going get much worse countries like Peru Columbia too. Take closer look Asian countries..the list compete. particular, teachers China, Japan Korea high salaries Actually many scientists estimate herd immunity may require 70 percent immunity.


""This would kill millions""

Would now? current covid death rate relative cases around 5 percent. However CDC said true case number ten twenty times higher. would put true death rate somewhere around 0.2 0.5 percent. people even lower, elderly people deadly for.


So let's say 70 percent US got 0.2 percent died. That's 420 thousand, nowhere near MILLIONS. Even death rate higher, let's say 0.5 percent barely million, still anywhere near MILLIONS.


See wearing mask social distancing. Look unemployment. Look children's schools. Look millions small businesses closed never reopened.


And look Sweden. literally beat virus nothing. economy spared death rates insane levels suggesting.


You're fear mongerer. Shutdown vaccine completely unfeasible. would simply take much time costs involved would hurt people virus. comments removed. I'm shocked! i'm absolutely shocked n lefty stance would suppressed! would hjave thought'!  21,50,000 isn’t number? island important, japan uk showed, still need strong leaders make work U.S. School System: Oh No..... anyways historical chapter great orphan drone awakening slaughter parental units. Germany cancelled Oktoberfest months ago. going US?? implying working parent, professional, major corporation paid time off. Dr. appointment anything paid. companies give 5 days off, plus handful national holidays, first year. So, want take day Christmas shop that’s 20% time right there. grand scheme things losing year 2 school matters catch later life.

It's pretty hard recover losing formative years early childhood education. one reasons Fauci adamant best ""safely"" re-open schools young children. 

Some parents experimented group home-schooling (i.e. home-schooling within pod families), strategy scalable, applicable lower income families, I'm honestly unsure effective homeschooling is. school reopened? several Georgia opened? perfect storm nationwide surge 3 weeks. Sturgis draws people local area relation total attendance. People travel thousands miles this. 

But outdoor bike events food stands. Every bar, restaurant, tshirt shop, tourist trap packed. going guys national MCs see twice year group hugging million times every day. going allied MCs different states thing. 

The entire area economically depends event every year. 

This horrifying. School authorities jailed attempt murder. Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that. sibling non-ironically informed benefits Hydroxycholoroquine zinc there's doctor treated 300 Covid patients lost single one. I'm still reeling. especially liked part explained like new idea maybe heard consider. weird part they've totally respectful choices concerning social distancing. I'm just... dumbfounded. paying attention using common sense, would know one pretending there’s children genocide happening this. it’s kids spread within other, take home infect entire families susceptible virus, consequentially spread even adults elderly. argument you’re making far point it’s obvious yet realize that. India Brazil ones remotely close. Australia 69th globally. India giant population Brazil currently competing country dumbest. $3 medical companies insurance inflate thousands reason don’t install IOS update first day it’s released. Ding ding ding. can't believe care much people working time like this. tbink want us die. Research much lot bad options painfully obvious start, obvious keep getting re-elected anyways. Always eye rolly see communities whine ""liberal demons"" ruining everything continue keep guys year year wonder nothing changes state.

Side note though, going said, would nice something vital voting would paid holiday people could actually it.  realize they're cliche' TV scenario, meant intention. come across bachelorette parties Wineries intended get ""wild"" I've run opposite female version last bachelor party went Vegas. Nashville bachelorette parties finna Graceland? bar crawl, Nashville place? 

I'm north Wisconsin personally know 3 different women+entourages went this. Nobody really answer ""seemed fun?"". help understand this. It’s trumps fault sense downplaying entire thing American think wearing mask hoax. here. left R’s back second Iraq war. amount mental horseshit believe, reinforce insane days. able admit wrong, place modern “conservatism,” don’t think could take man (or woman) seriously can’t that... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s pay forward steroids soup California read 7-day average new cases low thought ""That's great!""

Then looked carefully like ""oh"" great teaching moment algebra biology teachers explain exponential growth. Almost staged photo op news story could come three days later. media lie manipulate Dems. someone dies flu (but it), label ""flu death""? Apparently we've Covid, addition incentivizing hospitals $ Covid deaths. make sense you? 

When say ""a lot"" (with regards people 30s 40s), mean? #? We've relaxed BC since flattened curve. uptick seriousness gaining traction again. Lol, math again. Brazil: hold beer surprisingly, almost visible positive correlation teacher income % GDP per capita economic growth.

Where ""visible positive correlation""? Natural selection action. I’m saying, season chances getting flu got pretty slim regardless whether get vaccine not. image gonna future history textbook. oh god, another one thinks they’re smart. danger isn’t health kids, it’s families kids live contract virus kids many die, spreading further. common sense, use it!!!  Same!! weren’t allowed lockers either. school couldn’t use Bc “weapons” contries reopened getting contact someone positive means covid test.
Positive means self isolate (no contact even family members) negative means self-quarantine (stay fuck home).
Not following order mean fines 10000$.

This switzerland many people think good enough. 2 birds 1 stone first draft dies mommy daddy go version 1.1. get it. American moved Aus. guess it’s ya want make enough cash.  teacher, find time off, worrying healthcare bills child Aussie wife, 6 months got maternity leave(without touching time off), edges balance staying here. could program, get 6 weeks year, make enough stress healthcare child: US would wanna be.

Also, miss legalised cannabis! Oh please. capitalists nations aren’t acting fucking stupidly. Don’t blame America’s issue broad, applied ideology. quote bottom, I'll agree this.

Most Americans buy anti-mask rehtoric believe Covid liberal conspiracy, reality hardly effects anyone certainly themselves. lack discipline self-control, literal fucking hubris. would destroy Trump 2020 actually exact use gym house patients ventilators lying face down. Another sign people really don’t actually want kids. It’s stupid people willing sacrifice kids life hours peace home. 

If can’t stand kids staying 24/7 emergency don’t them. Starting?  Would could, variety health issues. students complaining school safety now, they've partying beach/house parties bars summer long?

Now school starting, suddenly care? You’ve listening American exceptionalism mentality long swallowed hook, line sinker. We’re number one many things, ones best at- well, it’s bragging right. attitude “my way high way, everything perfect, nothing improve, we’re best, guys suck!” embarrassing counter productive actually achieving goal excellence. could, easily, amazing country. would take setting aside irrational “fuck you, got mine!” Attitude empathy god gave average 7 year old. won’t, it’s easier shout great rather work great. Easier lie claim victory train victorious. can’t see ever making country great mind, we’ve every lap, celebrated every victory, toasted every battle fought. Except reality there, right front eyes: US team. us lose, lose hard, lose. numbers don’t lie, many us losing every single day.

And that’s directly ilk. quack like quack, duck like quack, hey, must ""Trust me, I'm Dr."" 

It's fun easy criticise experts. science inherently balance proof possibility - neither absolutely reliable longer term.

Makes harder genuine scientist convince community lack statistical discernment.

Whereas know know, mob backing up, also know WTDK, doubt stand chance. going junior year hs year tell personal experience that, fact, one gives shit students. Vaccines less effective obese people too, looking good all. And? They’re kids. Unless underlying issues they’ll fine according science. Look history School shootings nothing done that. I'm surprised all. one gives shit.

Talking teachers equally disheartening - pandemic started local teachers would create video lessons. school's requiring live stream classroom school goes remote. 7 hours. better believe means they're tech support - parents want teach children help provided resources. Microsoft Windows couldn’t wear sunglasses Yes rich people half mil stocks made much 99% working Americans. type work. know one day fly eu much better still wealth disproportionate takes events like wealthy suck even bottom 70-80% Sorcery! witch, burn her! Thats thing.. recommendations often work Sweden, swedes follow voluntary.
Its much quicker publish recommendation new law, new law takes long time process.
(But pandemic Swedish goverment made new laws also..) Bill Gates""help poor money""
Trump""give money"" nine cases covid school now, apparently word quarantine anyone tested positive, shutting down.

And someone Georgia believes superintendent would rather everyone die admit going back mistake. Croatia schools/university online except tests since late March. like 50ish cases day enacted strict measures 0 cases time June. people relaxed 100ish cases measures back way less strict worked bit, obviously less effective before. People seem scared 50ish daily cases pretty relaxed. Still decent amount people wearing masks stores (my observation would like 70ish %), people scared like were. idea happen schools, umiversity starts early october things might better then. surprise there. know, never dawned til read Seroprevalence estimates 0.2% 47%?

IFR estimates 0.00% 1.63%?

Dude, come on. That's pure garbage garbage out. based number 32 studies 50 estimates variance seroprevalence equal half population. right mind could esimate IFR low 0.00% straight face?

Once again, learn question everything. maybe stop quoting junk science cares? They'll end killing loved ones. dumb. let get arrested. that's way maybe learn eviction order wondering why. landlord like Trump I’ve properties pay rent considering covid19 haven’t seemed eviction even pressured tenants. looking property values noticed downward trend thought process along lines. 

If don’t stop foreclosures evictions see housing values tumble market floods buyers except investors. 

So looking property rent $500 month. Say don’t get rent year. $6000 lost cash flow. 

However evictions foreclosures happen property drops value 20% 70k property I’m 14k. 

Is Trump added bill instead handing stimulus check ubi end year? figured ubi would give Trump shot re-election expected worst case didn’t work tweet he’s hero it’s Biden’s problem. Sort like ex wife running credit card right divorce. Cleveland police ordered city wear masks, ordered police union to, support Trump. base reality reality around me. Also local officers photoshoot social media bragging killed tamir rice park it. assume every cop like minded. helps others doesn’t. elect partake it’s good ways calm anxiety someone talk good idea. 

I don’t use much anymore blue moon take get head CNN article peer-reviewed study. Nice try though! guess works cause worked together, travelers come one teavels out. Warner bro’s Sweden herd immunity. finally good news r/Coronavirus Sweden herd immunity, economy focus. can't confirm antibody test. highly suspicious it. also crap going right now. Including withdrawal medication. I'm big trouble rn. feeling weird heart sensations run. stopped day. I'm trying hard get antibody test. think that’s he’s implying cases reported entertainment district. 

Oh boy... recall crowded places visited family back 2013. Would nice visit again, definitely time right Obon holiday essentially started many Japanese tourists come Okinawa, typhoon hit island, perfect storm bad shit come.

This makes angry, also sad. both? seems little dramatic ngl What??? Lang also questioned efficacy masks, saying, “Just health official says something make true.” 

The article quotes random person (protest organizer) giving blanket common-sense truism health official says something make true. editor apparently feel need quotes factual information health authorities counter bold misstatement comes wearing masks. Meanwhile idiocy spreads every communication platform. Oh kids going get sniffles. Let’s lock everybody up.  Numbers facts. That’s I’m providing. advising anything don’t want to. Independently him, problem far many people follow blindly without reflecting person actually said. liked discrepancy title article Gates actually said. delusional think like that. low expectations intelligence first place. literally thought, maybe US government seeing coronavirus perfect chance reduce population little bit? Maybe kids 10 ""spread less"" 3 feet shorter average adult, therefore adults direct line droplets fire. doesnt make sence kids somehow less infectious, know exact opposite true virtually sickness. Well least someone 1% something, said great deal them. Y'know, richest person planet every rich person making profit thanks pandemic. nice see actually something, hey lot things would nice right now. Personally, don’t think government would pass opportunity gather data populace don’t think (UK) microchipping yet. wouldn’t put past government actually try though. [Flu vaccination rates UK high 75% risk suspect early survey result currently non-existent vaccine change actual vaccine released. example, pro-vaccine would want know specific risks new vaccine taking myself.


I live Australia would high confidence vaccine released here, lived US (for example) I'd worried current political pressure fast-track vaccine impacting fullness safety trials. Although strategy herd immunity, fairly uncertain close herd immunity? speculations 20-40% (which Stockholm seems have)? Thanks. report newer (1 hour ago) one read 4 hours ago.

Well... shit. D: KNOW, RIGHT?! It’s almost like hundreds thousands people dying close people something. 😐

Geez, think introverts hoping stick around something? order means nothing workers? believe vaccines whole heartedly safety drug taken extremely seriously. won’t first line take vaccine, also act risky fashion continue social distance. 

As soon intend travel take vaccine. traveling vaccinating wait me. I’m privileged enough remote salaried worker (who probably stay home save money anyway), I’m aware isn’t realistic everyone. Jew someone parent born grow country held Nazis, beyond sickened anyone would relate mask wearing getting train. person mocked endlessly deserve bad outcomes. general knowledge specific coronaviruses lot exceptions.


In general IgM antibodies show early infection IgG later. IgM go away faster IgG stay longer.


These time periods vary wildly IgM disease last years even IgG present rest life, every disease. IgM IgG diseases appear time, months apart. Also antibodies show resistant disease protect show contact cause disease protect you. Also variations patient response patients create less antibodies.


In general IgM negative IgG test broadly speaking would indicate somebody infected time ago.


PCR tests show presence rna/dna direct proof presence. positive somebody acute disease, chronic disease symptoms show person spread disease.


Now know took tests. combination IgM-, IgG+ PCR+ slightly odd general would expect RNA also gone time IgM gone. actually take tests time could end disease. cousin example tested PCR postive like 6 months feeling almost completely fine end. Another thing PCR usually done using nasofaringeal swabs would mean virus present nasal secretions thus could spread disease.


The typical scenarion would took PCR tests first serology later would mean infection serology shows too. impossible get kindergartners middleschool children keep mask.

teenagers however, trusted wear theirs. NHK. morons media yourself? explicitly justified stood notion large protests ok 

Nope, didn't. denied significant increase due protests. think massive protests particularly good idea, opening schools kids constantly close contact indoors(!) without protection much much joked schools safe protests (which half intelligent individual would see unsafe illogical risk) would imply I’m schools person. Maybe next time use fucking brain comprehend reason waste time typing, dipshit. 

Oh, joke? great sense humor have! problem plenty morons still believe covid harmless. check controversial post example. kind effect comment people, wonder?

It's even first time made kind comment. hey, got sweet karma, right? Surely that's worth it, ""dipshit"". I'm wondering upcoming Go Eat campaign would affect things even further; cramped familiar environment humid atmosphere prime high viral loads...

I suppose government would sponsoring Go Hospital campaign pockets now? :v bit CIA funded crack epidemic. Prolly get another one get close revolution. IFR assumption based 3 sources, two inaccessible third estimating 43 undetected infections every reported case. That's highly suspicious optimistic number.

Did it? mistaken, reported 84 cases Aug. 8 (published today), Mainichi claimed 100 Aug. 7. might seeing different sources, one told new record? repugnant, one awful things suggested since began.

It doesn’t mean easy, possible survive weeks face face contact, especially set daily weekly calls scheduled times connection look forward to. wish best. explicit reason NZ's early action.


Probably biggest reason NZ went hard early many ICU beds per capita, even moderate domestic outbreak would catastrophic. Elimination option, unlike Australia suppression continues considered viable.


But protecting Pacific explicit early reason delivering Herd immunity really quickly. honest might turn best plan. 

We well decided continue letting foreigners near zero cases easily went outbreak mode couple community infections passed along. 

I think it’s tough avoid disease might come roll dice see whether one lives dies.

I know certain shielding, lockdown quarantine whatever else want call - staying home avoiding people best way go preventing getting virus. FAT. surprises there. fat take vitamin D. think we'll breaking national records today cases, definitely going much lower previous days. Switzerland overall actually requirement test close contact someone positive test. Maybe canton specifically mandated it, least cantons around me, required get test symptoms ten day post-exposure quarantine. Otherwise quarantine get released back wild day eleven. AAAAAAnnnnd that's Hawaii closed business.

Y'all holes know behave, gotta kindly ask stay fuck out. doctor clear level exercise? people experienced [cardiac injury advised [refrain high-heart rate activity period DONT HERD IMMUNITY...it doesnt matter. got zero. petiole infected overseas got caught isolation border. borders still open returning citizens. 30% less cases US 2 weeks ago. 

Reporting total deaths 6 month long pandemic, missing last 2 weeks deaths seems like hardly big deal. 

From Mid April today 687.2% increase deaths, 882.4% increase cases. +/- 30% really big. We're talking exponential growth log plots. 

You plot salary years log plot, one year I'm make $30k, next $140k, yeah, would hardly care year make $210k $270k. Call ISIS. Independent States Insanity Stupidity. chains weakest link determines strength.

We discovering weak americas dumbest selfish are. 800 cases march 800 cases comparable though. multiple times tests now. numbers still way high however, think really time impose local lockdown Antwerp cutting rest Belgium. much stricter rules rest country. people going 'fuck it' mode needs stop. country dense Belgium can't afford people... pediatrician/minister believes sex demons causes gynecological problems

Wait said that? Yep, another perfect example. pays good money it! live denmark...how would happen? arent even close herd immukity..Why would avoid second surge would somehow hit us...it makes sense makes think this? describe reasoning? Toddler Trump toddler flock.

We held hostage dumbest among us. ""plus"" weather blazing hot, incentive stay home long weekend. hand, also means less careful mask usage due risk heatstroke (mostly regards vulnerable groups like elderly).

I'm thinking catching sleep things feel like oven outside.  totally don't. large part government went strict half per capita ICU capacity developed countries.  Twice school gone viral. Weirdly teachers, students, administrators continue interpersonal relationships never outside class.

Don't obfuscate man's death based career. Consider died schools open *yet*. telling many money life renditions defensively trying paint death insignificant contract classroom exactly thought.

Tests age quickly. Even immediate response (with good detection rate) test going get less less meaningful time goes on. Now, getting test result several days later meaningless time gotten. really helps positive might reduce prevent new contacts exposure, nothing contact unknown window.

There enough tests labs even get close confidence person showing work ""safe today"" ongoing basis. Yea, take rag, twist 'round hand, spin like helicopter. 

Petey Pablo even entire rap song instructions. sure downvoted. NZ great response competent leadership, island low population density definitely helped. Parent post mentioned U.K. Japan counterpoints clearly hasn’t London / Tokyo / Osaka vs. Auckland / Wellington. large portion Reddit community hates Trump, Trumps actions hateable. doctor clear level exercise? people experienced [cardiac injury advised refrain high-heart rate activity period time.

As said, issues nursing homes, hospitals. Budget cuts private nursing homes enough resources workers biggest issue. Put blame go, private nursing homes. see bothered reading sources. Blame private nursing homes. Blame budget cuts. talk Sweden euthanizing elders fucking retarded.

Also, people articles agendas tries save faces. Cecilia Söderberg-Naucler example predicted 2700 ICU patients early april, truth 500 patients. got interviewed lied said Twitter, interview recorded. 

Yes, people fucking die disease. ""SWEDEN"" kill elderly? No. That's stupid talk. 

Where from? See bullshit would make me, little ol laughs anti-vax Karen's, worried taking vaccine. That’s really something cheer 160.000 Americans died believe.

Yes unfortunately people USA dim-witted original commenter really care think meant. Let him/her explain themselves. comment offered nothing value discussion beyond virtue signaling. Obviously children's death horrible. fucking shit. 

If saying one death many, honest question back cancel school flu communicable diseases. Spare moral high ground bullshit (trying make look advocate read children, fuck off) answer question. point ICU capacity never risk. context supplied post along reason never risk. I'm sorry feel worth knowing context post. stink ICU Sweden means intubation respirator bed. conflating ""not given oxygen"" ""not accepted ICUs"". early schools reopening.

There's shit ton outlets involve around people. Phase 2 really end safe ok, that's phase 3 testing. people, actual sick, on. Development drugs consumes huge amounts money company would paying testing necessary. Shortly already safe minimum comes tests first phases there's really nothing safe (safe talking masses well money). Still waiting. said ""the virus mortality around 0.5% less."" That's true. reality doom gloom, would say otherwise? thought Americans days liked people ""say like is""... right? like alcohol sales going up. really suprising people longing escapism. think drugs way go. Considering large proportion furloughed workers hospitality sector struggle see even remotely true. people meant going work pubs bars restaurants closed months end? sensationalalistic headline created rile people Current ICU patients COVID-19 (where ""new ICU cases"") come play less 40. currently, nothing ICU capacity utilisation, monitoring increase serious cases. seem confuse oxygen peripheral ward intubation+vent.

A majority 80 year old survives oxygen general ward progress stage need intubation. Even people dont make die much peacefully oxygen + sedatives sedatives.

 

Prof. Gustafsson rightly calls ""active euthanasia""

Withholding simple oxygen would unthinkable country would lead serious legal repercussions. Well Ontario went nearly 200 new cases weeks ago 70 yesterday. since Ontario/Quebec vast majority Canadians live, nationally it’s getting better. “And yet, federal government established enforceable rules either protect farmworkers coronavirus instruct employers workers get sick. migrant worker advocacy groups say allows farms take advantage workers increase risk exposure coronavirus, farms say they're protect workers limited resources have, also getting crops harvested.” I’d say depends kind neck gaiter have.

Mine aren’t ones hug face, made synthetic fibers/polyester. It’s similar balaclava flip head cover. Pretty loose fit, can’t even make shape lower face wearing it, covers entire lower faces neck.

Edit: Mine made three-ply 100% Supima Cotton helps fact checking. would interested know mask still suitable use not. Looks like can’t. People refuse vaccinate immediately shamed/forced anyway. Schools requiring children get on. I’m pro vax, however concerns safety Except...... know.... hospitalizations..... going down..... Don’t worry, even everyone wants it, Americans far effective vaccine. Gonna need monthly boosters lol.  idea people want home improvements more?

Struggling towards end huh? Don’t know / Don’t care - Doomers shambles year pandemic gonna they’ll excuse leave bunker lol. enough people, find enough stupid people.

America unique aspect, although proportion seems rather high and... Usually people leader country well. I'm starting wonder Trump's presidency end election crowd millions going dc dragging out. *American government fucking stupid Well global pandemic going on. Kind hard say anything positive right now...... expert that..... United States....... studies also made lockdowns place meant kids leaving homes transmit it.

That addition kids less likely tested curious thoughts this: think DV activists often refuse use gender neutral language describe DV victims?

According links, roughly 30% DV victims male.

Of course, almost certainly underestimate, since know men less likely women report victims DV, due misandrist societal attitudes general, Feminist Denial Avoidance topic particular.

In addition, know feminists nowadays obsessed promoting ""gender neutral language"" every speech, regardless appropriateness. 

But here's curious thing: comes topic DV, feminists often (not always) refuse use gender neutral language, instead explicitly name Women victims DV. great majority every article, podcast, online discussion feminists DV refuses stick gender neutrality.

There examples too:

- military personnel: use gender neutrality

- business/political leadership: use gender neutrality

- healthcare workers battling covid: (often, always) use gender neutrality

So question you: why? What's strange double standards?

Let know thoughts. Holy shit, think expected ~1000 deaths day moment, considering we're even respiratory virus season, definitely feasible. true. suppress virus first lockdown you’ll get transmission point 50% vaccine protection won’t need wear mask. fact don’t even need vaccine end pandemic, need real month long lock down. stupid ass article states facts.

The biggest issue Sweden nursing homes safe due budget cuts privatization. There's regular workers, move different nursing homes made virus spread homes much easier. Also owners said nursing homes goal profit several cases reported many people living homes got sick died. 

And zero chance survival, would like put respirator several weeks prolonging suffering death? know wouldn't. anti-vaxxers USA. article hear said third wouldn’t USA. anyone thinks Americans exceptionally stupid, aren’t.   Alternative headline: 
Idiots gather yell educated.  got first man space though? Great point! One crucial difference though Park, family group moves through, much sticking adjacent another extended period time indoors.

That’s killer: close together + indoors + person/people + time. Anything 10 minutes within 3 feet another person hikes danger / viral load considerably. that? That’s classroom. 

Especially without wide-open windows, open doors. Disney public spaces indoors bet state art air circulation/filtration. 

Schools? Nah. new buildings. most. even Ivy’s (I worked one 16 years.) badass. Putting foot down!!?!?! way. reptilian elite shaking crocodile skin boots.

. Finally USA testing #1 schools! unknown (covid) vs unknown (vaccine side effects)

Its impossible make educated guess one less damaging Sadly, hundreds thousands. guys room family 4 100% agree you? What's WSU? Fauci guy wrote headline? Way Prevent This, Says State Get Trouble Wearing Mask Personally, trump touts certain vaccine, think I'll hang back behind mask solitude while...... Fauci in, I'll wait shorter time. Hundreds thousands trust nothing told trust random things Twitter Facebook? would something least passed rushed process without warning signs scientists.

But soon I’d take also depends widespread disease point time. I’m risk catching disease might careful vaccine. spread live similar southern US right now, I’d take chances vaccine risk Covid high too. I’m lucky sense friends family pretty much page regards virus. family many friends live different state. missed seeing them, used get together lot call this.  banning male drivers 25 probably save hundreds thousands life.   :( Like yeah hell wants take Russian vaccine stay away thread purpose. cannot imagine source optimism right now... Exactly. Stop “Japanese people saints superior beings planet” fantasy, coming Japanese guy. Yes is, please don't. Fauci saying he’s confident get reasonably control vaccine that’s 50-75% effective, ***along with*** people adhering “six fundamental principles people follow decrease curve cases:

Universal wearing mask


Physical distancing

Avoiding crowds


Outdoors “better” indoors


Washing hands


Staying away bars”

(quoted session School Public Health Brown week) You’re stupid. sit next couple plays out. accept exist aren’t getting vaccine. least shut it. care give us pocket change pocket change fucking enormous. buying goodwill necessarily bad thing. he's paying money it, call lemming I'll take it. Bloomsburg already demonstrated money get far, there's limit much political power buy. Plus, guy basically retired already. already money could ever want. Regardless whether he's motivated goodwill boredom, there's really much motivation dive politics he's rich level tax hikes could possibly put dent fortune. cannot believe many friends kids texted something along lines “I hope school stays open weeks virus shuts down, kids really need get house”

Yeah. COVID endemic area, best clamp ASAP! Ugh. fair, wearing hats indoors long thought sign disrespect institution. Marines allowed covered (wearing hat) anywhere roof unless sort guard duty dress ceremony. think respect thing power trip thing... hats least. heard years ago forgotten about, updoot providing link remind went. News week! news happens?

Who, what, when, where, and, why?

Don't get wrong, afraid likely, but, wrong. comparison WW II, appropriate guess since writting fiction now. would horrible, happen. Well genius, point clearly illness vaccine killed four times many kids illness without vaccine. tells either COVID doesn’t affect children like flu does, flu vaccines bullshit. 58% said get it... 42% people would. ""Life-long"" would nice didnt add braindead spins onto information explicitly stated something else like national evening news (NHK) Japan covers coronavirus news. first talk coronavirus cases Japan, Tokyo prefectures. Then, show soundbite Trump (sometime mention Tweet) something negative related coronavirus US. 

Tonight, skipped Trump covered Sturgis motorbike rally, mentioning use mask South Dakota government restrictions gathering. Then, showed France making masks mandatory outdoors.

I find whole segment amusing. Basically, message don’t Americans doing. Lol lot California cities red blue banned. 

NorCal especially. Oh no, people got murdered major American city! horror. even live America? That’s really good analogy Goddamnit type moron sets shit motion. ban cars. 1:300,000 death ratio car crashes equivalent 11 billion dying every year 😣 might still many government quit fucking around sister got symptoms tested. (UK) told 24-48 hours results. came back 23 hours. Negative thankfully. keep reading taking weeks USA results. true part spread.  People unsure maybe less likely isolate? agree. administration clearly everything power prevent this. Clearly teachers must blame properly enforcing social distancing, sanitation, preparing classrooms properly learning. disciplined. i’ve 19. shits awful Jesus.. Thats like 171 COVID cases. need look mirror. suspected saw doing....ugh. level blatant corruption manipulation unbelievable comes republican party. US infection level late. ""real"" lockdown going happen. first ""lockdown"" allowed liqour stores, hardware stores, etc. joke It’s English language thing. Basically exchange “Government country X” “location government country X” mean thing. sounds odd first get used it. Good know. Thanks. That's want everyone believe.

But rely everyone else vaccinated protect them.


When hear people 'pre-existing' conditions can't get vaccines, that's 'proof' vaccines dangerous.


When hear elderly people 'pre-existing' conditions die Covid-19, sudden kids nothing fear. No, proportion high, especially compared many countries, goes Covid, America worst Covid handling. bandwagon hate. may fibrose lung time Yes, this. many? Article BS. People angry, many people think flu. Despite 160k+ senseless deaths thus far, cousin still thinks covid-19 equivalent severity flu. stopped probably month ago, **very** diligent finally got head necessary. 

I still switch produce store produce bags clear plastic bags, admittedly that's less COVID thing like easy organize produce drawers (and see what's go bad) they're size shape containers.

If getting spread surfaces meaningful number, we'd now. Seriously it’s insane. Everyone like “I’m educated think critically” spread bullshit “rushed vaccines.”

Then either don’t read don’t even acknowledge information fact vaccines safety trials passed 8 years ago and/ tested equivalent amount years. 

I little faith left people. There’s fucking shitty Russia, VACCINE takes YOU. said, get it. ""logic"" logical and, logical minded individuals, makes heads hurt. Republicans lol people un employment sub blaming ""both sides"" saying one 2 chambers (H+S) cares them.

I saw youtube clip comments Pelosi's announcement. kind wild seeing people blaming democrats republicans look Dems trying do, clearly interests people compared Repubs. I'm saying dems done shitty things past I'm biggest fan, like people want blame politicians support ones trying actually help. 

Yes, one party may may lean towards personal beliefs find hard fathom takes precedent health welfare people time like this. making pretty nervous upcoming election well. 

I suspect, could wrong, lot people actually looking details differences bills two, considering repubs advocated last stimulus bill. Sighs. bad. Depends age kid local laws. example, state grew illegal leave child age 12 home alone. state currently live legal min. age leave child home alone, however, notified, DCYF wellness check child age 8 left home alone.

There's also lot suburban fear around children kidnapped home invasions. blown proportion 24 hour news cycle, regardless, majority American parents feel comfortable letting grade school children walk block alone school, let alone stay home alone multiple hours day. Suspend means deny grades. Must nice. 

I'm glad them, despairing us stuck US. Try Texas. I've always lived here, keeps getting dumber dumber. I'm thinking retiring different country LOL. sorry outcome, better know. I'm first line vaccine, would need still. I'm optimistic vaccines think going full immunity everyone. think people still get infected able fight quickly. Many low income moderate income families need schools open need go work school functions daycare meal provider. people disprove theory evolution evolved apes Said I'll say again, bad wear masks keep certain distance regardless whole essential business nonsense. businesses work making us come work fired endangering lives health workers lives health others well. everyone going say it, gets bad enough cant afford miss much work. essential workers, meant hospital, govt workers, delivery guys go work don’t option job crucial Covid-19 duration. non essential, meant required maintain business operational. last comment, asked options non-essential workers going leave kids going back work. 14 days extreme side incubation periods. people symptoms 5-7 days. 98% people symptoms day 12 been? Everyone expert epidemiology, immunology, virology, vaccines. Remember case count 15 POTUS said control would soon dwindle zero? you’re saying roundabout way dominance US since end World Wars coming end.  “No Way Prevent This,' Says Nation Regularly Happens” similar vein UK protesters recently saying “Defund Police” definitely something applies US here.

If UK police defunded would cease exist. u/roydhritiman comment gold 😂 No, think vaccine contains microchip. vaccines bad. think Corona hoax.

They put another question survey: ""If answered last question, plan voting 2020?"" That’s good news! can’t relate friends here, they’re atleast 3/7 days week Good point. Still, safe effective vaccine years human trials. months belt. Canada, someone actually wanted director health unit (45 minutes west Toronto removed) due mandating masks face coverings actually petition 2500 3000 signed. 


This actually drove people go neighboring municipalities shopping felt reach. 


Like sure hate mask rule sure folks surprised. Inadequate health insurance coverage, large undocumented population, inadequate housing millions, many crappy LTC institutions, dysfunctional government (including cuts key health agencies) poor leadership USA issues clear years now. 

The trajectory death, illness consequential economic misery truly disheartening. thought ""COVID"" become mathematical operator now!  Actually lot anarchists pretending protestors wearing industrial masks protect tear gas, protect protestors around them. again, guy sighting 50 person limit. Masks irrelevant that. good people Arkansas. Especially reverse Friday. lot family Midwest.

They gonna follow guidelines freedom Trump “Myocarditis disease causes inflammation heart muscle. inflammation enlarges weakens heart, creates scar 181 viral myocarditis patients ended cardiac death heart transplantation within ~5 years. call permanent. Lol individuals charge reopening. Get off
Your high horse. I’m sorry hear that. Thanks sharing 🙏 pretty good indication virus contagious. lesser two evils argument doesn’t really much good pandemic. look issues; one other. can't. Americans banned practically every civilized nation Earth. countries allowing places dependent tourism dollars, Americans going find jobs there.

America petri dish. example flawed. Winter happens every year. COVID happen every year? inferring kill beleive government doesnt care us let get worse needed be? many times going get posted...... least 6th time. I'm beginning think psychological defense mechanism play people denying bad is. disease unprecedented living people's experiences, runs counter think modern world. uncertainty overwhelming. probably lot easier mentally say ""it's bad, like flu"" accept bad is. Right like ""You write spit people potentially carrying deadly virus asking follow basic hygenie protocols die sub $15/hour wage."" Fuck employers impatience.

Isn't whole post parents impatient school start get back work make money provide families? Respond accordingly? Like writing letters? Close damn school numrod  American exceptionalist crowd good ""at least Brazil"" now? many successful attempts happening globally students back school right now? Anyone articles saved recent? course different everyone. point is, many parents position send kids packed classrooms pandemic. make sense let keep kids home parents choice without schools packed?  Lulz! That's return investment chips activated become drones huge! 

/$ Yeeeeeeup. elected teach online since seniority wife daughter considered high risk. working learning home. understand summer bad many parents. got hang kids play chill long time cherish time. got teach daughter swim underwater instead instructor come out. rewarding. know folks, I've read interview creator vaccine Russian media. said vaccine mRNA type vaccine, genetically modified ape adenovirus. experimental way vaccine creation, initial trials looking good, think order repair global image Russian science decided go full steam ahead one. Left dead 3:IRL, come! They'll go cheap. young person wants slow, loud, unreliable, expensive bike? Numbers manipulated though. nearly extreme problem way many people wearing situations clearly be. even care do? 5 months people died 4 years gladly take vaccine.

1) people say take vaccine, get attacked saying without seeing evidence things like phase 3 trials. 

2) people turn around say stuff like ""i take vaccine""....without seen evidence like phase 3 trials. Really? you? curiosity work, family, friends, go world? probably contact deadly Rona influenza, yet reddit. I've COVID, fever shortness breath month, yet reddit. let idiots opinions vaccinated children huge breaks measles happen let people opinion. let people opinions. deal pro mask opinions. like opinion, like ours.

P. S. I'm RN see many asymptomatic patients admitted taking bed truly sick. Please explain that. wonderful day, stay safe. Often overlooked US history Soviet's fighting lost 27 million people. Sure vaccine may risky, willing risk thinking catch covid-19 vaccinated. vaccine works strain others? vaccine works limited time like month? know answer questions. Answer questions generally take time. vaccine development takes years months.  Canada plenty racists cops look many indigenous people died police welfare checks. That’s IFR, estimated cdc may around .26% Yeah, home Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Rich pricks Miami. Theyll fine. stuffing face med room. Eating piece pizza 10 seconds flat tx. covid cops, racist cops arrest (particularly black) small amounts cannabis mostly young healthy men died.

Help businesses stay afloat pay employees little possible. Spend economic stimulus rich put savings accounts. pay rent especially save it. /s

Save stimulus check, keep roof head another month, and/or buy food. Vote dollars. Vote well-being. Bro, uniquely American train pure stupidity malice ain't got brakes.

We gonna die. Completely unnecessarily too. mortality rate 99% virtually one asymptomatic. I'm always amused ""What about"" cases conclusion *always* matches preconcieved world view.

i.e. masks required condoms not- conclusion never maybe requiring condoms.

Places allowing restaurants serve alcohol prohibiting bars particularly bad logic. likelihood prohibited *never* conclusion reached. account propaganda bot CCP get it, especially several kids. overwhelming. agree, hard partner one kid. think people good parenting need school activities baby sitter. Beautiful place, hopefully chance visit day. Another day another dolla how’s going people government never tried first weeks. Memorial Day green light everything back normal.. produce bred sturdy enough handled machinery. Flavor consideration. American tomatoes taste like garbage. Yeah shit never go away, vaccine symptoms reduced majorly, whole bunch diseases severe even pandemics things even think anymore. Enough enough. longshoremen need support fellow mariners refuse work ships crew changes implemented. Giving letting ravage population seems like likely strategy **that**. people think mask mandate infringes right contract virus, pass onto friends family, infect others. 

But rights freedoms? Yes can? methods death different deaths nonetheless. puts perspective COVID deaths compare well known war people know caused lot death. could well kill them.

And yeah, they're supposed give up. cousin start freshman year devastated. Maybe dont get pregnant case? Tbh, I've come expect country point; ignore wants/needs majority cater wants/needs minority. 

Your voice heard ever forget country Earth comes freedom. /s  Mine simply observation comment based article question. touting fact zero evidence back claim. order take protective measures, must first acknowlege threat. 

It’s like first half First Step Alcoholics Anonymous: “Admitted powerless alcohol...” 
That is, must first admit problem. 

These people can’t get that; it’s scary. threatening. (unconsciously) choose remain denial. Humans this. It’s entirely common.  banned coronavirusUS mentioning politics? Kind unhinged think politics isn’t reason virus bad US. post made regard neoliberalism/ free market ideology holding back feds actually anything. neutral response pandemic. Hasn’t every death toll projection wrong far, remember supposed 70,000 Whatever didn’t tell us based whose pockets might in. Everything goddamn weird right now. number higher 6 months? project number actual number?

on second thought, wanna know.... :( one wants psychotic republicans showing doorsteps guns. Means react enough vaccine generate proper defense. spreaders like unvaccinated person. pop fuck them?

I see there. open schools, we're nowhere near peak yet. What's disheartening still exposed infected people go grocery store. Even spent months social distancing, could wrong place wrong time still get sick. ""recommend"" that, claimed much teen suicides teens dying COVID, isolation good teens.

No one saw numbers yet though, (weirdly incomprehensible) words  675,000 dead population 104 million, would 2 million proportion current population... keep copying pasting contents article? Hahahaha. It’s like think we’ll reread go “ooohhh get it, HERO!” People need stop shopping cuz they're bored. open stores still flooded usual. necessarily, pregnancy complicated, every mother prepared mother, every woman wants kids.

Whether vaccine actually stimulating immune system patients? cases people vaccinated still got coronavirus. Whether vaccine work 1 strain all. trials proceeding lightning speed, way answer questions decisively. sceptical yet positive, believe month yield sufficient evidence. seems going taken seriously many people lose someone close personally affects them. normally enough get FDA approval? best advice ever!

so decided look happy YouTube videos instead... ended watching PETA video:  :(

Warning, click PETA YouTube video leather jackets leather seasts car home:  think India Brazil reliable? Donald, you?  yet Germany still basically runs Europe dont anything it. Attention citizens, please gather fucking idiots one place get quicker... he’s going bring virus back Arizona he’s done. 

That’s thing idiots don’t understand, doesn’t affect them. affects everyone come contact afterwards. DE-FAULT DE-FAULT DE-FAULT  USA USA USA!!!!! /s Lol good luck Yes, something along lines. I'm concerned long-term damage humans - 9 months old much know - I've read people who've discharged succumbed damage weeks months later home while. 8500ft mountain closest person 1/2mile away pretty extreme, especially air getting noticeably thinner. obviously choice. make sense me. Brazil? mean, basically seems like allowed become petrie dish almost century. mean, kind boggle could done first place? *checks profile* 
Ah yes, r/Conspiracy. says everything. Canada, don’t even think getting retail 300-400k CAD, grow/extraction everyone I’ve talked 1M+ CASH even beginning plan application process Canadian I'm curious said done (if ever) blame ever resolved? pin schmozzle government? dont get government sit watch say ""we fucked up"". People dying seems like gave up. people dying what's important not? I'm thinking loud anything else. That's big part Wow CCP propaganda hard spot days.... Wear fucking mask stop crying. Hehe ikr?? Wish people really think way!!! Grrrrr Lol cute! stupid? stupid people live country? from? love one state this. 

Our leadership good understand last statement. stupid understand people laugh this. history happened countries. get it. 

You say whatever want live ignorant speak us American claims know assumptions counties true they've never lived there. new feature Plague Inc. 2.0 maybe Thank you. slight headache nothing counts fever. nasal swab would probably find virus, I’m going isolate pretend I’m sleeping hangover.

Please so, careful yourself. Normal life .... history world never golden age grand short time. Grand scheme, normal. reaction pandemic, what's going happen something worse happens? Smdh drive Paulding greater social distancing lower rates common cold may mean reduced cross immunity human corona viruses. Thank you! skeptical rushed vaccine widely distributed. Normally vaccine takes years create, vaccine created less year good reasons believe flaws. pretty accurate considering Americans probably brought Wuhan first place, 200 Americans attended military games Wuhan, 1 mile wuhan wet market. 

Remember mysterious ""e-cig"" lung disease exist years, suddenly appeared US China virus? Yeah probably covid-19, US gov thought related e-cig usage, wasn't, e-cig usage made covid-19 symptoms way worse. Also, 2019 US flu season especially ""bad"" abnormal death rates, yeah lot probably covid-19 too.

Also, interesting US almost never attend military games before, suddenly do. Maybe trying spread virus another country scapegoating, mean US called 1918 flu ""Spanish Flu"", even though originated US. pretty obvious facts place. facts front you. opinion, conclusion inescapable. I'm sorry need things spellled out. world work like that, find relationships they're front page New York Times. Yes.

I’m saying insidious messaging is. It’s technically true flu kills lot didn’t go crazy it.

It glosses several important facts... modus operandi current administration. accurate think nuance forethought lie mollify people go school go school. thing 2 weeks. they’re hardcore Fox News it’s lost cause I'm blaming intensely fear driven response virus grand scheme things bad. far worse pandemics 68 57. 68 one might killed 4 million people.

My dad even remember pandemic despite anecdotally relaying story sick got traveling Europe year. remind massive pandemic.

So find troubling something like COVID, lot remains unknown, clearly immediately dangerous vast majority people, causing situations endanger children otherwise preventable illnesses. wasn’t real lockdown. yes happen. neither... I'd actually like OP chime here. see may meant wars ever. Especially considering way America handling virus. could actually happen. Boooo I’m Colorado we’ve done okay far. People state going ruin us college students can't afford take semester school. I'm currently going junior year Iowa State (as state student), get 2/3rds tuition fees covered academic scholarships university. take gap semester, would lose scholarships would longer able afford go college without taking massive amounts debt. people financially choice. missed mark badly triggered? Shhhh. tell. ""They done like Sweden"" says [the /s saw snapchat, someone went big party, cases state rising...  Texas fucked oil prices? ""I know anyone AIDS never use condom banging everything two legs."" Seems almost clever. can't stay home dumb rude selfish F_ker! go work non mask wearing dumb F_ks! Treatments combined better/more testing could go long way towards squashing without vaccine. Practically every country is. sure Brazil worse matters much. Thank much!! really appreciate taking time that! Hope great day! guy high meth. demanded money roommate meth refused, stabbed roommate. thing is, hotel COVID positive subjects placed together. seemed doomed start. &lt; 1 mean. you’re wrong reasons think Thanks using proper screengrab. think Flanders' father says line, actually mother. us work. terrifying. state given us help situation either stay home starve, work probably die. government hasn’t mass producing hepa masks kn95 like masks since beginning beyond me. study also assumed would ICU capacity, would cause lot deaths.

So sorry you’re let 200k Americans died instead 1 million! Guess preventative measures justified kill 1 million thru shitty response rather less huh?

Take hike please volunteer catch virus since you’re concerned preventative measures took pulling masks shout old ladies trying eat lunch spread like wildfire. R4-4.5. Yeah, morons bring lion door let house eat too. Donald? matter certain % understand / agree logic behind wearing mask. make mandatory, enforce it, move on. makes sense considering I’m pro mask pro social distancing. good try. I’d actually argue it’s people like love crisis porn causing people fatalistic follow public health guidelines give up. Deaths/1M population good measurement severity epidemic. Viruses spread based per capita much much later pandemic. US large country, virus take lot time spread 300+ million people. 

Look states. ""good states"" kill rate 1500+/1 million. That's atrocious. 

Then factor half states report probable Covid deaths like rest world. Sweden records death attributed Covid person died last 30 days. Imagine US used standard. top that, know fact southern states actively suppressing Covid related deaths. States like Florida, example.

Finally, already reported US 200k excess deaths year, quite bit higher 155k reported end July. even factor fewer people died car accidents causes staying home. 

The US fucked. wait till force students teachers back school. Teachers start dropping like flies. 

300k+ dead end year US Covid. still significantly less actual number. truths National Emergency refuses take responsibility it! Sad! Labour Party described ""liberal"" designation New Zealand ""centre-left"". That's inserting domestic US politics New Zealand context. words, due complete ineptitude, Trump going get Americans killed Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito combined... called anything. merely clarified think 300 thousand young men faced bullets tougher scarier battle (because violence) 160 thousand died far 150 thousand projected deaths. *half truth* even exposed comments? Tip: they're available drop ballot ballot drop box. Much direct worry much length time ballots take get destination r/COVIDGoodNews way better sub. Yeah, basically people dying flu *and* potentially controllable outbreak. get that, do. feel point someone grown room something drastic give us fighting chance. literally steamrolling entire country powers letting happen. know there's anything done point believe ignoring living life business usual answer. unpossible predict would happen. Please pray families. What's difference billion million? billion. may less accurate, even change case/death counting method, change fact ground, spread virus increasing....it'll take longer show numbers. brother 39, almost 40, suffered non-COVID heart attack yesterday. He's relatively good health, eats healthy, mostly vegetarian diet, job keeps physically active. Since worked job, bother wearing masks around since basically exposure group. I'm going wear mask around keep safe he's work.

Never forget seemingly healthy necessarily mean high risk group. ""encourage"" people use cocaine, put jail.

Out examples could chosen, pick failed war drugs de facto/unofficial policy US go herd immunity, handful states attempting like Canada, Australia, etc.

If effective vaccine comes months US made wrong choice.

If vaccine takes many years, that’s different story. 

Since New Zealand seems poster child right now, I’ll use example. vaccine never comes, long NZ keep foreigners out? much economy (and people) suffer admit eradication easily transmissible respiratory virus impossible? Canada thinly populated amount geography have. I’ve always thought realistic compare infection rates dense areas like metro Toronto USA rates get better sense. Calling age based genocide fucking retarded what's happening ALL. Sweden? yes, stop masturbating Flashback truths SD propaganda. Dumb dumb. thank you. trying best stay home keep customers alive kicking. Aum Shinrikyo still around they’ve gone rebranding they’re nuts COVID-19 OnlyFans probably going wipe strip club industry. So...are actually recovered virus dormant awhile? tryna meet god That's cool all, experts designed studies picked size trial reason, think apprehension naive. phase 3 trial population 30k, 50% receive vaccine, would expected 50% chance identifying complications occur rate 1 15,000, nearly 100% chance identifying complications occur rate 1 7,500. 

The study also give us definitive data regarding vaccine's efficacy, approved less 50% effective. think 70% effective reasonable estimate.

Are really saying unwilling get vaccine disease 1%+ infection fatality rate (keep mind vaccination protects vulnerable around you, yourself), may complication rate occurrence less 0.013% trial missed? think missing bigger point here, went go see FOZZY Sturgis there's decent chance get see lynyrd skynyrd pretty soon gender That’s true though, something there’s good period you’re infectious asymptomatic things get worse kill slowly could get good infection rates. You’re completely wrong saying physically can’t be. false equivalency loss life different. 


What looked days life lost.


Average covid death age 65, average life US 78. 13 years 4745 days lost. Multipled 291,557 1.38B days lost


Average age soldier WW2 26. 52 years lost 18,980 days. Multipled 291,557 5.53B days lost


Im saying response isnt terrible, think could better, lives still value. cause old doesnt mean worthless. simply compare numbers important look beyond. Welcome cesspool world. Murica! guys this, really can!! Canada knocked park. We're clear we've showing multiple days close zero deaths hundred scattered cases across whole country. numbers dropped 10 fold last 6 weeks.  whole doubling masks especially Toronto ever. go inside anywhere without mask 95% people complying. biggest fear American tourists border jumpers right now. Can't worse workload holidays.. I'm assuming younger symptomless me.

I support vaccinations. think it’s absolutely idiotic vaccinate kids.

But, considering admin desperately clawing anything make seem like virus isn’t “a thing” people need concerned about, don’t really trust whatever vaccination developed quick dirty admin above-board regards safety. ever worked job people trying look busy, know kind thing get recorded lied about. Happens everywhere. He's issue, people affected way believe becasue seen it. ironic becasue people likely believe it, believe strongly something never see.

God. party personal responsibility can't inconvenienced. USA one parties, Republicans, decided deliberately accelerate spread deadly disease made political calculation killing hundred thousand people would political advantages them. death toll high continue high republicans want many people die possible. really listen conservative talk radio couple hours realize pervasive unambiguous message hoax propagated liberal left. Oh, thought murican saying line. check AAU events happening Florida last month. Flying wire, AAU holding sorts sporting events.  I’m curious see volleyball players families weeks event. You’re moron. Breaking news:

human children are, fact, humans! bet would able stop little better tried little harder control it, we've decided let people believe hoax. addition that, even extremely unlucky ended getting one rest stops, still going extremely unlikely pass along always practicing measures return home road trip mostly isolated life home. Rather attending fucking bike week. cannot less zero. COVID-19 responses heavily centered around politics, talking about?

 Australia decently island, cases starting surge again. 

Kerala India one worst hit countries population 38 million, yet they've done better wealthy nations socialist politics.  Europeans afraid criticizing America America protects Russia. Euros able social programs save money defense spending rely America's military might. Lockdown neither mentioned described wall text. real reading comprehension problem going think. Tell us country different?  Uh, 5% fact time. fault people reporting heavily skewed fact great majority cases unknown/untested time. fwiw, people suggest case, general public, wanting believe problem widespread already, ignored caveat. one lied. unable give absolutely accurate information beginning crises mean can't give information. People able understand time/data/experience means better info. fault shitty ignorant public case, improvement refinement data/information viewed kind ""evidence"" misrepresentation. Could evidence type herd immunity, research point may allow us Exactly, 7 day rolling average best metric use gauge we're at. cool whit saying potatoes danger ?   
Show scientific proof say,s nicotine small doses dangerous.   
In high doses is.  
But basically everything    
Cigarettes dangerous cus shits ( nicotine ) about? Can't handle someone stating facts death rates?

Isn't original comment replied same, according insane logic? reply buddy?

It's fact EU handled pandemic much better US. 

You can't handle fact rambling switching """"arguments"""". Hi, know current stats are? buying hysteria? Nanofiber filters available pharmacy Korea Japan. 

It exciting biodegradable, terms protecting people nothing special. I'm densely populated northern Virginia. They're even entertaining going back in-person learning, announcing online public school children ages notice.

I've seen school districts parts country say go back online learning first two four weeks bringing kids back classroom, think that's ludicrous. virus date publicized upon subside making person learning safe entire community. Schools absolutely online learning strict set community criteria even remotely entertain returning in-person class. grocery pickup morning 11am semi-rural Alabama town 30 minutes outside Birmingham. house Walmart, counted 16 churches, every single one full parking lot Sunday services. disgusted community. isn’t protect one another pandemic. problem posting studies track retroactively based self-reporting. includes times schools closed children interacting others much. conclusions based sort trial (obviously) infected kids infected adults try spread virus adults better. clear kind test prove assumption kids transmit never going happen, depend analyses past spread. controlled environments match happens open schools winter.

I'm arguing children equal vectors. I'm saying data looks like schools. camps schools open, gaining data. say ""hey, look, schools closed kids interacting less, kids spreading it"" considering historically valid incoming data based open schools camps... dishonest comparison.

The data getting now, showing kids spreading amongst themselves, important. dismiss it. end child genocide? think so. way data dismissed outdated data scientific approach. data showed protests cause new cases. Yes, protesters masked many regardless, new cases outbreaks them. indicates large crowds outside risky even chanting, yelling, singing, etc..... would seem indicate big risk factor indoors. NY big though. Lots suburbs rural areas high infection rates. Chris hosts hour show SXM Octane turn every time comes on. idea covid related miscarriages thing data isn’t readily available feel like guinea pigs point. I’m currently working home kids come September sent back school full time masks social distancing nerve wracking asthma carrying fetus makes anxious. Social circles opening, flu season coming, hoping doctor would say something along lines “yes, need careful” could relay work reduce exposure people said opposite there’s evidence currently suggest otherwise. brought fact pregnant women susceptible flu immune defences lower (to prevent bodies attacking foreign body fetus) didn’t acknowledge legitimate concern. Lol. Hopefully he’s right...

As getting pregnant, happens, best say point cautious limit social circles. learning new things virus everyday it’s hard trust get told. everyone remember told masks useless don’t spread Covid air? January... fact dont get see year 2 justin fields trump rest conspiracy gang beyond enraging think opportunity hiring low cost migrant workers trade off. basically we’re going stop wearing masks social distancing ever. heard folks; vaccine won’t effective, public health measures will. NEVER leave home uncovered long live. Think that. Got bread freezer right now! 75 cents sale. Crazy cheap. 5 dollar stuff. Anyways think enough people realize bread freezes quite well. good tip. Brilliant!! Yeah live parents theirs. taxes even received tax refund back April yet stimulus even mail one. It’s screwed big time one cares even bill collector feel coming govt persistency come till get check Russian vaccine cause knows kind long term side-effects

yes, point? attack people throwing blind accusation actually try see talking about? That’s fair point. feel blessed fiancé spend time this. 

In honestly, lived alone, would absolutely identify 1-2 quarantine buddies trusted equally careful spend time with. Come on, ""petition.whitehouse.gov"" WH believe too, studies support their/that point view? set checkpoints bridges tunnels couple days ago  Making Irelands decision leave visits US even idiotic see upward trend deaths Canada, looks like trending zero, 5-10 deaths per day US well 1000 perhaps last week starting trend little down. Cases testing numerous stories data issues, also delayed results cause testing delays positivity rate going down. Canada currently 10x less deaths per day per person US. 

You really can't spin People standing store mask talking unstoppable virus is. virus mind asking? colleges lower tuition long parties trips. happened enough times us define bound. think it'll 3 decades, that's way long, probably sometime know people getting 5 years infection, obviously know 5 years. must look like shit show rest world. It’s unbelievable many self centered extremely vocal people here. loathe become political thing  Please explain parameters NY alright?

May onward.

No one saying shit start, they've got good long term plan. Huh? safe ways travel. Avoid airplanes you’ve already avoided many contact points (airports, security, baggage claim, crowded planes can’t distance, etc). best way travel car control environment. Hotels updated safety protocols online check avoid front desk. Camping even safer yet since you’re outside. mom says Regardless many people kills age, hospitals overwhelmed caring seriously ill, won’t able keep normal hospital volume top that. You’re healthy 25 year old car accident? Sorry, converted ICU’s COVID units, we’ll best save you, we’re exhausted resources limited now. Oh you’re 51 year old woman abnormal uterine bleeding may endometrial cancer exam maybe hysterectomy would save life? bad, elective surgeries canceled surge COVID patients, you’ll keep bleeding hope things open cancer spreads. Wrapped bacon.... Unless they're completely horrible person wealth power like Bolsonaro, think morally right mock someone get COVID-19, even they're ignorant anti maskers. literally cites Oxford university source made conclusions based facts. somehow encouraging mass protests May.  New South Wales small number cases. Melbourne lockdown night curfew compulsory masks stores business closed. Numbers stabilised days fingers crossed start going soon. yes large portions Australia free. GROWN UNDIES, QUIT BITCHING WEAR FUCKING MASK!

I regret one upvote give you. Stay safe. last post you. Quit spreading misinformation. boggles mind ridiculously unaware perpetuate whatever beliefs based nothing skewed opinion. Back January whatever completely unconcerned Covid said nothing. knew pay attention. cover awful death count beginning cover up? We're obviously talking cases greater 3 months old. classic conspiracy theorist stuff. government cover anything want, first. think originally heard saying reference stuff happens military, amazing many things apply to: ""shit rolls downhill"". programs make money clearly downhill big cash cows. call nothing burger, totally take point. people can't understand issue bunch people breathing common space mystifying me. vindictive man-child. news comes Professor Russell Viner, President UK Royal College Paediatrics Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies member. It’s mere excuse government flimsy speculation, unless you’re implying type conspiracy (not it’s impossible doesn’t seem credible supporting evidence) Good thing 250k people got together Sturgis weekend. Can't wait half pass MN way home infect everyone... cousin lives GA talking this.  district let students parents choose 90% wanted in-person.  district clearly deserves blame opening, parents students deserve blame too. Actually Trump nothing would better. 
The response White House set “sanctioned” resellers PPE equipment. Going far seizing PPE VA hospital states purchase items sources Trumps friends. 
And spread lies deadly virus fight wearing masks. There's lot fat people hate country. banned subreddit. Couple fact hits poor minority communities harder, yes, white people know think happen them.  think fat enough, think poor.  maybe maybe won't. odds favor. However thanks volunteering care fat people, POC immigrants die, know really are, there's silver lining. really know bunch dirt bags acquainted before. Wow peoples lives kind scoreboard you? Disgusting. care health?"" mask-clad Patrizia Antonini asked people United States... ""They need take precautions. ... need real lockdown.""

Oh, many us know, Patrizia. feels like we're sane people locked asylum half inmates, people running place, insane. CDC knocked park lately instance ACA work? I'm sure fully repealed. Definitely, could write elegantly would better excluded awesome Americans like aren’t like that. You’re appreciated.

Just lot frustration around America currently. person doesn’t want care politics keep trumps got things shook seems become part every day life... don’t want be... makes angry.

I wanna sit house, play guitar, listen music, smoke weed, grow garden yet world stuff driving nuts America seems obvious point what’s bringing life. Ya said bunch stupid shit. people like can't trust *anything.* 

If phase 3 comes back safe one multiple vaccines gotta roll dice. already rolling dice unvaccinated. Fairly young population compared west. imagine must help significantly deaths since younger people tend ok. think like half india 25 antibody test prove many accounted found.

You also false positives take account.

Science still counts ones found. household adopted better safe sorry approach this. I've read reporting less likely spread fomites, every single package comes house gets opened front porch contents wiped diluted bleach water disinfectant comes house followed aggressive hand washing.

Same groceries we've purchased locally.

For mail, 3-day rolling approach. go mailbox get 3 days worth mail. lives bag car 3 days, bring mail inside. bag goes back car get next 3 days worth mail, hang bag car 3 days bringing in, wash, rinse, repeat.

We also regularly use cloth disinfects groceries contents packages (because cloth already wet disinfectant) wipe commonly touched surfaces like light switches, faucets, soap dispenser tops, door knobs, name it. may still get this, lack trying get it. Kinda like flu? Where’s there’s many strains vaccinate common bad ones might slip through? nitwit governor idiots follow! Weird Australian officials able stop protests, yet danger Germany, Japan, US let go threaten fines.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m taking plenty seriously, thanks concern! medical experts actually medical degrees expertise universally declared hiking minimal risk. 

If COVID actually spread easily everyone touches gas pump passes within 10 feet outside, literally every person left house since March would gotten it. 

The virus primarily spread sustained interaction indoors. Hence aren’t conversations anyone, going restaurants, going gyms, spending time friends.

Staying careful great, unhealthy paranoia unnecessary. ""the US reached 5 million cases... health officials believe actual number perhaps 10 times higher, closer 50 million""

That's around 15% population. 55% left go!  IFR running number Afik. akin nCFR (naieve case fatality rate). Deaths /infections *100.

So people got sick yesterday counted though recovered. 

I prefer rCFR, (resolved care fatality rate) counts dead recovered.

Dead /(dead +recovered) *100.

Which last looked, US closer 6%.

For 0.65% accurate, need tens millions mystery cases.

Deaths * (100/.65) = #of cases. 

165,560 * (100/.65) = 25,470,769 cases.

If reporting 5m 25m, gotta say, impossible stop point. godly people earthly concerns always seem excellent, earthly, lawyers No. issue tens thousands cases daily. 

The volume simply high many infected people contact trace. RIP students dont play top earning sports, millions scholarships, virus gonna push poor ground further. experts could warned us this.

Well fairness governors fired (or tried fire them, case Ducey). Let's giant motorcycle rally! article clearly states provinces report weekends. concede notice absence reporting weekends.

I'm sure true. Probably closer 100 years would accurate. WWI massive wealth transfer Europe US WWII made us manufacturing powerhouse. Yeah responding (several commenters) saying basically “we know help least wear them” think oversimplification. example don’t think mandating masks cases extremely low clever. countries, especially pretty much this, batting 5.5% American here. There’s us fed shit described. Setting date allow arraignments made. Food banks/grocery stores. neighbors putting pool.

  dying. That’s true. – is,” Trump said. “But doesn’t mean aren’t everything can. It’s control much control it.”
  
It indeed. suprise...am bad person thinking ""ok"" read this? 165,465 total deaths, 5,182,014 total cases

That's 3.19%

Where 1% calculation coming from? I'll believe heard immunity percent infected approaches 70. source making herd immunity claim pay-walled, much doubt 70% saturation anywhere world. wouldn’t symptoms quick. show like 4 days catching it. went TV said ""DON'T WEAR MASKS!""

He narcissistic a-hole disaster nation pandemic, closest find is.

[They Don’t Wear things wrong ""dear leader"" need invent things. First, paper states 20-50%, 40-60%. Second, authors implying part herd immunity. scientific study without anything politics. fact, language ""*This might implications COVID-19 disease severity, herd immunity vaccine development, still await addressed actual data*"".

As scientist myself, need present 100% written paper. said post regarding herd immunity interpretation opinion, paper presenting. Look, I'm Europe I'm bewildered everyone going around saying kids transmit virus we're testing kids.

We're going see lots sick kids US Europe going say bad US. club general. bars. Tell American kids teachers either getting get covid... 250,000 bikers Sturgis... people rallies protests... etc, etc, fucking etc. Well, thank asking question, cus led look little deeper. There's still lot controversy surrounding issue, may worded initial statement strongly. said, reaction.was actually caused vaccine, still small numbers would vastly outweighed benefits vaccine. Here's fairly long really interesting article topic wanna dice rabbit hole: think may new research published since article. still reading do. ignored missed point, harmless enough. Everyone it.

You went further: missed point added insult. No, trump, one state adequate time passed realize extent time asymptomatic spread, faulty USA testing could be. simply sending patients home soon, lived, nursing homes. I’m blaming foreigners blaming corporatist system chooses profit countrymen.

Surprise surprise, populist nationalism thing. 

I think need fix system American citizens suffering put foreigners. unapologetically care fellow Americans someone isn’t American. I'm pharmaceutical chemist. Growing up, mom hardcore believer eating organic food avoiding ""chemicals"". I've managed change mind extent, tell accepting evidence conventional food safe goes instincts.

I specifically avoid buying organic food whenever possible reason. industry's strategy ""convince everyone competitor's food literally poison"" absolutely infuriates me. They're spreading anti-science conspiracies profit. Yes assume foremost authorities matter closest correct have. denominator large size America. compare extremists country like Germany America, comparing 83 million 329 million (I'm jut using Germany example). Germany fair bit America would consider right wing extremists, even percentage population, America millions size. Add Germany actually laws hinder extremists speaking out, much media American dominated, hear America's.

Really, biggest problem large amount apathy last election con-man elected president. even get popular vote, people turn vote needed to. electoral college, unfortunately, actually give equal influence every voter, something desperately needs fixed.

Another thing federal government unwilling impose official measures socal distancing national level, another thing could made unwilling wear masks likely wear avoid trouble. things got much worse since then... quote this, think they're going give ""at risk"" people first. I'm hoping time get it, get kinks worked out. probably getting invitations kind parties. Remember Italy number.... u.s.a!!!! everyone wearing masks? not, chances probably high. Sure, obviously good contact tracing relies people test positive. boss forgot, coworker suggested get tested. miss friends. see again?  must missed false statements said masks much help first put CDC itself, going enough masks PPE medical personnel. idiotic way keep supplies available medical workers, ended costing thousands lives. Tons bars still open loop holes. Drunk people passing around like crazy hate people, love gatherings! say though Obama nothing it.

/s Heartbreaking, ever want hear Republican say pro life again. Cause aren't. Even fetuses, care unless trying control mother wear mask something could punish mother way. oh mean like whole europe? continent virus taken seriously people going bankrupt catch it? yeah, terrible would absolutely agree many points. least part. degree failure properly respond pandemic falls apon shoulders many politicians major parties. Evidence many years suggested would happen ready. current president shoulder blame, really spread across many administrations. prepared moment hopefully ready next one, already know....history tends repeat.

As far Republicans reasonable intelligent, right bad time make confirmations, too, know Dems simply watch CNN state that's good enough them, refuse believe fact came source like. believe independence moderate effective collecting info. leaning either way, typically getting full picture.

you're correct far individual markers intelligence, I'm also aware many citizens many countries may incredibly self aware actions, again, try call ""stupid"" selfish, use political party write off. Many people could like members family mine. must find way remove politics matter pragmatic what's happening order find solutions. 

Call compassion, call blind, order fix what's clearly massive divide, least mend somewhat, remove judgment anger. numbers low! sorry see now.

If selfishness eliminated virus. would over.

You beautiful city sympathies Well, countries allowing americans guess insurance thing, deciding flight cancelled.. UN could send people help virus elections that’d awesome possum. Oh god.... shutdowns way crate them.... need open schools NOW!

^(/s, case) live deep south. People already living mentality COVID. like fucking death cult. Europe dont test find virus anyway. open something virus numbers lower. kid full plate want eat cake like kids ate dinner. numbers simply reflect massive amount testing, asymptomatic. Europe likely similar numbers tested. Hate ever use phrase “you’re right”, you’re right.

Americans don’t choice.

At time, made bed. better job next time. they're smart enough vote. Cases go 70k 50k little delusional fuckers already back. months back “Cases going up, hospitalizations going up(derp derp derp)” new motto. “we reached herd immunity, that’s going down”? Ffs 8 months. Put fucking mask stop dreaming over. testing us unreliable, antibodies fade within months longest cases weeks. testing 20-30% serologically infection rate far higher. year New Yorkers test positive covid antibodies, still disease. guy flout requirement. REFUSED comply masks, came back spot violation again. proof others refused came back cops? Also, think bum going city, sightseeing? Probably panhandling harassing law abiding citizens. city need pandemic classic oh, thought sure kind boot-based lifeform. possibly maggot. EU deaths USA significant portion USA Covid marked deaths fake. So...? talking brother-in-law who's EMT, said healthcare workers talks coming around idea Medicare-for-All see people lose insurance get turned medical care. tragedy really laid bare failures system. hope enough people seeing (or sadly experiencing) failures change public sentiment favor universal system. Proud idiots. hate wearing one's stupidity sleeve considered badge honor, rather mark shame. eyes catch it, rub eyes eat something hand? Ah good old deflection tactics. realize losing argument deflect something completely unrelated. Six months disturbing reports post-vaccine waiting  here. kids really anywhere since March. get together anyone. trip taken pick puppy camped lessen interaction others. essential worker house wears mask every day day. lie, ""over it"" continue part keep family safe everyone else safe matter much would love go zoo wherever else. antivaxxer issue. difference happen sympathize. pro-vaccine people want sure vaccine safe rushed testing

The vaccines going phase iii trials, therefore rushed. idea rushed it’s going fast simply ignorance trial process safety tested. Maybe given time understand long term effects it, any.

This duly addressed phase ii/iii trials. Again, misunderstanding process. government throwing money get scientists doctors working it, rush testing phase.

See you’re building anti-vaccine case? don’t ability judge rushed standard you’re using feel pacing. think antivaxxer issue, people common sense concerned safety vaccine...

Verbatim perspective ...being rushed masses fraction time usually takes create new vaccine.

This condition actually reasonable. You’re them. think good opportunity gain perspective empathy so-called anti-vaxxers feel perspective exactly do. 

Personally don’t issue anti-vaxxers pelenty challenges criticisms valid addressable. doesn’t mean they’re correct, like aren’t correct, shouldn’t given consideration deserve? Last word big difference is, america deny even effects them. europe simply care. little difference 500.000 fully aware smoke good health one basically volounteering die tobacco. smoke, die lung cancer unless i'm extremely unlucky. 

i'm fully aware Covid there, i'm taking seriously, still risk die it. 

your analogy would correct take consideration people driving drunk put danger people selfish behaviour guess what, end jail they're caught. “Bought” key word here; mythos surrounding self-made millionaires individualistic survivors concepts sold American people benefited compliant workforce, ie one would actively sabotage efforts towards collective betterment. Queen Freddie. care, people care refuse wear masks. people charged battery. New York resident, I'm happy also bit surprised. 

I still see plenty people dumb. sure would spike now. family friends comes hoarder's house first time sees rooms piled high ~~trash junk~~ grandma, grandpa, aunt Kate, cousin Lou, etc...

Fixed you. Nordic countries contained virus. Thus open schools issues. worst outbreak world nothing containment. Thus cannot open schools. Get it? voluntary times

Except case literally voluntary. can't say something voluntary times blatantly untrue there's examples people getting forced work.


If send people solitary confinement working, forcing work. provide hundreds examples prisoners forced work like - ""inmates Angola, cleared prison doctor, forced work threat punishment severe solitary confinement"" Yeah, understand. American dream become nightmare. ***It's 1%.*** 

165,465 deaths, 5,182,014 cases

That's 3.19% Global warming means people stay outside longer! can't that. go cases

Oh right could forget go cases. least remembered last means first. Check states requirements poll worker! learned Michigan poll workers paid, signed up, ridiculously simple. IDK states handle election official duties though, Democracy MVP wonderful things Michigan. state military well. setup way distinctly different Europe federal government override states general states rights rules law. drive across border break law tint car, bringing beer, etc. totally independent suprise, next million waiting start testing beginning. hear florida stopped texas difficult atm guess There’s saying truth “progress made one funeral time”. 

Morbid hell, wrong. comments thread show sub vile toxic place. Much like mother sub r/politics, people actually seem gleeful thought people getting sick dying, perceive different political views. 

A close second toxic hate pure cringe. bunch people whose education listening professor’s opinions social issues screaming dumb idiots don’t “believe science” don’t “listen experts”. people lick actual education, they’d realize two things: 1) science governed quorum experts agree, 2) novel scenario there’s lots lots informed disagreement countries do. type science “don’t mix ammonia bleach” - it’s large scale, theoretical, model-based, necessity imprecise. Early trying explain Chinese coworker Americans going wear masks. back cases still really China knew obviously going spread here.

I tried couldn’t come reason confident Americans wouldn’t it. 

Then saw people stores ready eat hat, whatever expression is. I’m back, knowing right generally unhappy observation stubborn-in-general personalities, aka types rarely admit wrong, and/or apologize life. types way right Yes...the 40 million lost jobs tragedy here. Yet also country rationed ww2

There riots minorities unpatriotic ""using much fabric"". Uh, linked ""planning scenarios"" states:

""The parameter values likely change obtain additional data disease severity viral transmissibility COVID-19.

Parameter values based data received CDC June 29, 2020""

Plus assuming CDC data accurate. Plus assuming everyone symptoms gets tested. Plus believe Covid deaths accounted for, like sent home ""recover"". explain asymptomatic spreaders? 

Maybe hold contempt little, people. completely stoppable. majority apathetic/in denial ingest pesticides food, EVERY, SINGLE, DAY. wear clothes dipped formaldehyde they're shipped you. vaccine take drop absolute OCEAN contaminants constantly flowing body. Especially vaccine based old inert virus already taken 10 times 10 vaccines.

The alternative? Getting sick coronavirus, letting invade cells alter DNA turn body itself.

Let's keep little fucking perspective eh?  Man Reddit really loves posting comments I'd like see US History books writes 2020 disaffected American, truly appreciate thought process. way Canada handled pandemic, way US should’ve handled pandemic. could’ve pulled total New Zealand.

Yawn okay mr scientist China, South Korea, yes. parents arent worried? ones sending kids know choice. parents talk arent worried? Based sketchy US stats yes. Let’s compare notes end year leasing causes death every year like heart disease come up. 2019 alone, 650,000 people died heart disease. year they’re miraculously surviving last six months. Keep repeating stupid stats. area see kids store time It’s crazy understand works. think look purely last month, IFR going much lower 0.65% older risk people still cautious younger people much chance dying getting droves. Gotcha. Miscommunication. saying 150 million ain't much gates. 3 bucks him. say appreciate anyway. appreciate vaccine efforts look around world see things hurting keep supposed vaccine ""risks"" perspective. literally political system without corruption. many cases linked people compared daily number new infections Canada though? honestly joke thought devoted kind event, think like primary method new infections Canada watching news. summer camp, daycare, etc. Yeah, look Victoria happen eliminated make mistake.

Dont want end like us. the...the...um...person WH know everyone else. I'm saying children really risk. big numbers used scare people. yes 2 weeks include previous 2 weeks deaths too. deaths point accurate. basically exist worst thing possible every situation start virus Bill? people dont get tested CDC says 40x cases tested also sneeze directly mouth. news, water wet. Lol. isn't, ok. It’s stupid. Trying pretend Trump’s ravings “one side” screeching lunatic. household median income below? US benefits often tied economic status. make income, often vacation too. Vacation evenly distributed. Ahhh ok. Makes sense. Thanks  many died? Bingo, nailed it. shopping household, can't count number times I've seen kids market since March one hand. begins.

That's anyway. lasted shelter place orders place though. learn it.

Asia Europe full people understand pretty well. one could ever seen coming. Yeah teacher beamed million classrooms once, let’s say 20 kids per class. happens 20 million kids individual questions? 20 million parents need speak teacher? one teacher assess 20 million kids provide one-on-one video sessions/meetings kids parents? providing meaningful feedback child, responding grading individual work samples?

The “best” teachers aren’t recording video shutting computer day. There’s lot involved “beaming” prerecorded lesson every student school.

And aside, there’s single teacher WANTS teach remotely. fortunately work state numbers low school pretty solid reopening plan, teachers states rising case numbers every right fight start year remotely.  amount fucking unbelievably stupid parents believe “parent’s choice” whether send kids back school SOOOOO worrying.

Like nooo, obviously stupid enough send walking petri dish child school without thousands walking petri dishes, government step make rules stop you. dude, bro, old enough mother (nice pity mouth there). dislike false reporting whining. 

 ""Just kicked everyone out"" implies notice warning. 

""Didn't let come back get stuff""... ""clarify"" could, did, met resistance. 

They also tell campus landlords throw kids out; provost said *expected* students return home. 'Cause... Pandemic. 

Students place go? Penn scrambled make provisions them. know, international students *literally* nowhere go. got stay. Others home go to, got stay. heard/read complaints fortunate.

DP quotes bunch whiners who, example, wanted Penn pay work study money could pay rent stay rather return home, work study work done. Students *wanted* stay rather *needed* to.

That's it, I'm out. Congress useless nation.

Reading title, reaction Holy shit. Almost like 9/11 reaction Sure! What's up? sounds cold, Druss novel Legend right. 

The scene earl (old friend titular character) dying castle getting ready siege. earl dies (leaving Druss charge defense), characters wanted full nobleman funeral. Druss shot down. accused cold blooded bastard one earl's closest person (it's since I've read it). Later Druss talks person calmed down, concurred nobleman funeral siege imminent. Something happened Druss said mourned earl, last breaths. died, body, and, much respect man, concentrate getting ready siege.

COVID-2 special. first coronavirus encountered. spread understood well enough. Assumedly would flu every year right? thought issue spread parents teachers? Congrats. still damaging everyone else's hearing poor replacement receding hairline, forgive holding applause. US politics affect world regardless. That’s weird I’ve definitely flu multiple times life Parents send sick kids school time. I've seen parents dose child cold medicine sending them, hoping kid sent home another day free daycare managed parent big day work. common COVID-19 there's sadly reason think kind poor parenting behavior change pandemic. Frankly think many still believe hoax. Trump Fox News got Americans killed Communist China + Viet Com Korean Vietnam Wars. Think that. Yikes. That's even worse. Removed enough see real damage causes, position spread like wildfire. :/ see fellow Rush fan  nuke COVID orbit. way sure! Physical Therapist.

Not that's breaking news, lol. Anyone functioning brainstem able tell that. Yup, I’m still pissed swings banned playgrounds protect village idiots. . 

Is 2:00 go bed. Haha honestly. symptoms got test. would stay home. Everyone get test results. 

But there’s difference live. It’s easy say above. Netherlands get 100% paid home sick. Well yes, someone coughed face mask would stop droplets hitting mouth nose.

Your mouth nose ways get virus though. Worse... heard stories kids trading masks friends think looks cooler “Custodians disinfecting daily” like giving condoms guys walk brothel. Y’all, check guys post history lmao Hmm. think understand I'm saying. 

I never thought kick people wearing masks. still people telling it’s flu. “The flu kills 80 thousand every year states!”

\*Pre-edit case comes up: 

1. Gay people cool deserve treated respect.

2. Yes know contagious that's joke. Labour Party UK (our main left wing party) manifesto month things will

* Bring rail, mail, water energy public ownership 
* Deliver full-fibre broadband free everybody every home country 
* Tuition fees; free lifelong learning, giving chance reskill throughout life
* Introduce Climate Environment Emergency Bill setting law robust, binding new standards decarbonisation, nature recovery, environmental quality habitats species protection.

Just points manifesto skimmed, lengthy Ftfy: WaY. CoUlD hApPeN? America really needs new slogan. Something simple small minds perhaps, freedom clearly excuse selfishness. 

""Freedom &amp; Responsibility"" ""Freedom &amp; Justice"" perhaps? crisis really show dangers utter selfishness. wording poll terrible. doubt small, significant percentage population may deny vaccine they're anti-vax. understand different percentage population willing take vaccine later considering vaccine rushed significantly would rather wait little bit see serious issues arise. poll could also validated vaccines probably figure percentage US population take vaccine certain amount time. User name checks headlines read like thing think sunken head drooling memeface.  psychotic Republicans (redundant, now) refuse help create sensible budget choke vital social safety nets like chance get, particularly there's Democrat charge. limited resources used things like buying necessary drugs instead PPE. know, important give billionaires tax cuts prepare pandemics. President United States tells everyone stop testing yet insists everyone meets tested. 

It's ignorant, evil. Come on. That's naivete extreme. There's way hell people put even atom critical thinking reasoning response. sheer fact 'vaccine' taboo scary word lot people ought tell something brain-dead ignorant are. sign school's virtual learning option time. I'm terrified school starts I'll lose mom. scares even :&lt; Yeah low people imagine. land free starts em early would also stop droplets getting side well. Use logic man. immature, small mind thinking.


There far options 2. die cooped either. look around, explore world, develop hobbies, even hangout small groups. 

It's absurd absurd False Choice Gaslighting is. people exercising caution COVID demanding everybody stay home year round. ""At peak""

Bwwhahahaha. think peak? Man, barely getting started. US wile ride. Georgia started opening schools last week. Already two counties schools large case counts. One school 90 staff infected, another 260 students infected. schools likely join shortly. 

Under normal circumstances, schools routinely run supplies fail follow guidelines. retrospect unreasonable expect meticulously maintain hospital level sanitary standards simultaneously controlling student movements associations, inherently crowded space originally designed high density packing students staff. Unfortunately comment me. tried explain WHO's .05 1% mortality rate C19 argued pretty adamently 3.5% based confirmed positive cases / confirmed mortality rate. tried explain # incorrect wasnt it. I'm coughing it, blocks virus right?

No, not.

It stops droplets spreading everywhere every time sneeze, cough breathe. Unfortunately, agreed stop literally beating village idiot death, also gave ability beat little bit. Now, hundred years later, turns detractor local community isn’t punished harshly and, ya know, people shit.

So, shitty people social/physical punishments actively dragging neighbors means lot shitty neighbors now.  Oh yeah right. Oops bad. 

Ok I'm starting see allure. universe far trendy country forgot giant thing lot people travel for. Florida way getting better.

People dying like crazy weeks behind testing. 

Things absolutely getting better, especially since schools open Monday. My...aren't high mighty. Calling shmuck said death sentence. Hope feel better. wear mask, social distance. show every single person irreparably harmed....I tested positive. fever 2 days. Quarantined like supposed to. End story. Quit doomsayer. problem. virus run course countries count excess deaths vs socioeconomic cost mitigation policies.  ...so? New Zealand place that’s COVID-19 free? dad's retired doctor, enjoyed response nonsense: ""If could wear mask 12 hours straight assisting brain surgery, idiots wear one five minutes they're buying lottery tickets."" push home, mechanic every week 54k reported new cases? Well said. true think there's concerted effort going get people distrust ""rushed"" vaccine. fare, black blue don’t really go together. right here??? mean, dirty Eastern states would want that, rest us alright haha, Western Australia pretty much back normal, except closed border rest country, haha.

America truly appears filled far selfishness many nations, least type scenario isn’t one SARS

SARS disappeared own, leads two things:

1. much push create vaccine - need one disease seem around anymore?.
2. importantly - can't run phase 3 trials disease around. Similar problem vaccines MERS - annual cases phase 3 trials unfeasible.  wish another country would care citizens US, see terrible government is. “There's time operation machine becomes odious, makes sick heart, can't take part! can't even passively take part! got put bodies upon gears upon wheels ... upon levers, upon apparatus, got make stop! got indicate people run it, people it, unless free, machine prevented working all!”

I'm still social distancing close (extended) family backyards, bringing food/drinks, getting ready resume virtual gatherings back school happens. province 100 cases 6 last 8 days! say reportedly? damn that's definitly right way. good job NZ heard story seafarer got aggressive neck tumor sailed port port trying find port allow disembark get taken care months nobody would. Meanwhile grew grew. lack humanity people justify try slow spread virus really shocking. People seem totally unconcerned type public health except C-19 right now. Um, no. That's works. That's works. Sources buddy. Well help fellow human instead spending 5 minutes typing condescending comment zero information.

What learned studies reading? Mask wearing lower rate we're spreading virus around like crazy like Americans are.

Zero cases entire area like... months now. know we’re microscope, national media follows reopening schools across country,” Hightower wrote. “But know decisions based people New York Kansas think, concerned “optics” “image” — we’re focused what’s best community.”

You're going kill people. Image optics aside, hell best community? say governors health experts say ""we're going back normal vaccine""? vaccine reach, *can* go back normal? Where's proof kids caught school? He's Bill Gates. think cares profit. 650,000 US die every year heart disease. banned McDonald's? Maybe stop allowing fat people enter grocery stores? lets say hypothetically sake argument big mommy milker mommy major udder big mommy extra milky milkers 200cm milkies milkers full whole breast milk mommy pegged bad dragon 13 inch horse dildo full balls extra grip included cum tube shoot hot cum extra cum 62% cum semen serum extra warm combined milky mommy heated stove trajectory like half million. hospital reported covid specific inpatient bed count peaked mid July, consistent downward trajectory since.

I long ago stopped paying anecdotal attention daily summary testing, new case numbers, fatalities focusing hospitalization reporting. I’m hoping upon hope trend continue governor make stupid choices like open things state wasn’t pre phase one CDC guidance.  That's nit what's happening. maskless person mini Sharknado. bring sharks you. people denied care get stop wasting valuable State medical resources save people everything book. morons going kill people around healthcare professionals taking care them. Principal removed arrested. addition comments replying you, also hard stay zero cases BC desirable place go Americans Chinese.

Covid, much like climate change showing humanity weakness soverignty able coordinate across borders well. Instead coordinating Covid strategies, USA slapping 10% tariff Canadian Aluminium. Never created coronavirus vaccine before, time different. numbers peaked April, saying ""its summer"" oversimplification. headline using ""Berlin"" synonym ""the German government"" seems. entire country, Berlin speak ignorance. That's comment deserves. Educate try again. can't even help people. 30 million unemployed, millions facing evictions, 1/3 children eating enough... Good luck.  us live towns bring back to. They'll spread people make shitty choice. I'm trying buy groceries live. flu way worse kids. COVID terrible old Fat. Stop fearmonger bullshit already. talking citizens countries transferred Germany ICUs full. expected treatment would paid countries Germany stepped told everyone would cover bill instead. one show 45mins ads movie Someone gotta help there, capability, so, not?

If US nationalistic moment pandemic control.... post headline like scroll see bottom feeders...2 time xD missed big gang scare late 90s then, consider lucky older folk scared shitless gangs taking America's schools turning dens drugs violence. Almost blown top primetime television series making inner city schools goddamn battle royale fighting gangs.

So... obvious solution ridiculous dress code policies felt like 1940s again. makes sense. kill enough poor kids, remaining poor kids grow labor puddle able demand least another $1/hour ultimately, everybody wins.  Meh, tests west worthless state-provided placebos anyway. Lol. first time someone shoves ""DIY Corona Test"" q-tip far childs nose lawsuits. would trust general public take samples end numbers trust? you’re shirt like creating Subdivisions. Laughs EU 

Anyways, pretty sure $3 poor countries only. Atleast thats got quick look article world isnt inside political party... still covid... what? Except happens follow general trend. Sound right.... would estimate 1 3 Americans complete utter morons... may conservative estimate. fuck wrong you. Wait, German cities already? Generally, EU health service providers supposed honor national health insurances member states. missing? YIKES

This happens people disregard pandemic. Jesus Christ *Baby gang, baby gang, baby gang.* Ok???? lol. $150 million ... That's what? 0.1% wealth? change nothing. meaningless PR stunt. A.k.a. Funeral awesome!  agreed good. Keep away grandma fat people beat thing herd immunity. expect see deaths this? WW3 going everyone vs USA. Based military budget, we've planning it. Generally. natural selection works long periods time big numbers.  Hmm. like respect point even Trump's fault. Masks work germany... fuck many americans ignorant? wear mask fucks sake. hard. But, every country going back shcool, American. company meeting last week discussing remote options CEO mentioned au pairs. Yikes. 8 months still anecdotal cases almost conpletely discredited (look South Korea). wasnt case youd seeing pop NY, China certain European nations point. seems sensible form immunity least year. easy reinfected twice arent seeing nurses? Wtf even talking anymore poor planning state felt COVID 19 wasn’t bad masks social distancing “sheep”. could mandated masks staggered schedules etc. states it. hellbent getting kids back school time. hope see quickly spreads nobody dies bc it. Tx first time lol day! tests taking week come back..they mean anything employee would still working time. Tests make sense tell couple hours employee positive sent home immediately. Parenting hope correct I’ve seen step shit come better many times Oh.. no... sheeple cared money businesses Warren Buffett would still alive, slightly richer...



Or supposed conjuring wild conspiracies one world's wealthy elite, friend Bill Gates still alive nearly 90 years old plandemic... Wtf? Haha sub funny. Honestly I'm going lost major cities head think hikes nearby. I'm Trolling. someone disagrees Trolling? Even visited Manhattan went hike less half hour outside city 2020 gets inevitable zombies? side effects usually happen right injection dude, that's case far guess masks effective afterall, eh? see person’s logic thinking. point classroom setting, especially classrooms smaller kids, little chance teacher isn’t going get “to level” many times day therefore rendering concept almost moot. mention students many schools sit desks counters (depending class) raise height significantly. know way art classes, courses, science courses, etc. chances scenario grocery store department store greatly reduced, necessarily zero. So, feel using way explain away dangers school really useless argument. It’s argument don’t get stressed pass kid supermarket. Can’t speak anywhere district. saying “close contact” covid positive person persons closer 6 feet 15 minutes. would notify people tested returning school. first lockdowns, it’s treatment regimens suppressing data? NYC flatten curve, denying it. Obviously Florida Texas shitty job, use NYC early lockdown states example laughable. want buy stock companies producing vaccines make money everyone needs remember reading article MSN.com early little stories group people around country who’ve died COVID. would estimate 95% obese morbidly obese. Many story 60. clear either smokers facial features. I’m much mindset we’ll find later majority COVID-caused deaths going linked obesity smoking/vaping. 

Example: Nick Cordero died young relatively healthy, guess what? five years ago quit smoking — habit since 10 years old!!! poor man’s lungs likely already shot. knows also vaped giving smoking. Many people do. 100k total death count confirmed covid cases.  NFL players opt games. Still receive $150,000. 

Society: Crickets. CRICKETS!!! 

Teachers request able work remotely keep themselves, families, students safe. 

Society: Teachers lazy. Cut salaries. Give refund taxes. 

MAKES. ME. RAGE!!! COVID matter courage fear. 

It’s way empathy versus arrogance IMO. Don’t superintendents master degrees, guy sound hella dumb. Sometimes used scanned books convenience, still checked hundred books time university. Sure, online “time effective” know exactly you’re looking for, university place exploration looking shelves books superior process browsing thumbing related texts. Sometimes walked though totally random sections see interesting things could find. 

Think thousands students use university library year, honestly think library actual value students? think nobody using books there? I'd assume goes effect now, hold breath it'll probably struck court. fan free speech? Right? Well shit, US barely isolated refuse wear masks feel like continue like every country took seriously... #derpyderp know, don’t want deal headache fixing childcare ability parents work kids learn cost effort developing programs, switch identity politics ignore glaring problems plan act like aren’t sentencing constituents death hardship. party country, lack political hard work, refusal one side admit pinching pennies federal state aid fixing covid-caused problems secondary issues result far worse economic recovery far later date funded every social program need right now. Instead bailed big corporations let protections renters unemployment benefits run plan help provide real help people losing homes ability feed families. takes one bad mutation fuck everything up. Slow steady wins race, right? I'll let others take it, get worse, I'm taking it. Rushed vaccines never work like should. Meh. Numb numbers now. Everything around fine. Everything back 90% normal bay area. Even traffic backing up. see point I'm sure solutions things left free will. words, good elections, good let elected officials certain amount autonomy (otherwise point electing them). obviously good grifters like Trump use autonomy crooked possible, alternative make much sense either, far see, least. means vaccines people science deniers, I’m it. 

That “sizeable faction” stubborn anti-vax idiots get less sizeable. read ""man excess 100 lbs (obesity) survives corona"" I'm fun like people charge care staying charge  see opposite. Instead new OS every 5 years, I’m forced get new one every month, it’s going happen surprise it’s least convenient. seriously going quarantine? intern governor’s office test negative. opinions, dangerous lies stupidity. bothered fact thumbnail photo article woman face mask pulled chin, swabbing child bare face.

Edit: even wearing mask, goddamn earring. NYC antibody tests 20%. 1 5%. Everyone worries microchip willfully carries personal tracking device almost times. point bother paying college? downvoted tone, one likely downvoted throwing exaggerated insults.

I zero knowledge MIS-C information actually really helpful context article. take downvotes personally, want exercise, take day read understand went wrong. story kids school opens. kids home more, often care grandma aunty etc. come schools; current background rate kids Covid. Again, you’re thinking emotions rather logic. Nothing I’ve said argues favour opening schools. fact, provided cogent argument keep schools closed. I’m merely saying argument *you* made non sequitur. lots good arguments favour closing schools, specifically. Merely pointing teachers capable dying weak argument. 

As turns out, I’m educator I’m obliged return work shortly. mask requirement students staff. It’s going hell recognising students... masks better nothing. least call virus racist. article says 3,000 effort. Whatever works! reported cases. takes account people may felt sick paranoid enough get tested. total cases likely much higher that. need weeks determine many cases really are. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* takes ""Larry!!!!! Larryyyyyyyyyyy!!! LARRRRRRYYYYYYYYYY!!! HEY HEY LAAAAAARRRRYYYYY!!!!"" rubbing 3 months ago. we’re trying give countries hope. Non-American here. exactly can't enforce mask wearing? 

If Asian countries it, can't America? Everything fine. 9 students ""packed halls."" Let's jump conclusions let play out. students caught, they'll self isolate back school jif. Wait see. Obviously would spike, thats surprising. question need ask is. spike new cases worth benefits getting things back normal? Personally think is. cowards. 

Most waiting someone make decision could made local level. someone else blamed. want take responsibility needs done. 

Make decision take responsibility good community. another way saying patients running asylum? so, 100% agree. Bro Australia people stoned working McDonald’s get mandatory 4 weeks paid vacation law. 4 weeks paid MINIMUM employer provide.

I moved states staying there’s way Inwould get 4-6 weeks year states. Also first job 8 hours day, 4 days week. 3 day weekends really blew mind. Seeing right benefit, I’m going Ponzi scheme. Ok, Good time cleanse country overpopulated anyways lol Zen version: *it It* *you It*. Predict what? realize children infected school, right? positives result tests performed July 16 July 30. oh yeah season mess, lucky get without player serious case, 60 games sames ambitions worst hit teams. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will season shut down? dont know, players still playing It’s easy make progress virus already run population do. Lol well live pretty big metro area isnt place within 25 miles doubt would one within hour away. Thanks asshole, troll. remember George Bush. 

He Texas foreseeable future. Check friend's free kids getting tested before? popping now? United stand, divided fall Oh ok Kids grandparents, infected. Gran Gran die old. Government save SSI Obesity Maps depict self-reported obesity prevalence among U.S. adults. 

""Would like go way tell government overweight fatty?"" mean plan it?
They said kids would get ""get it"" slim chance dying.

It horrible disgusting plan that's surprising. Marylin Manson still around? plagues stuff..must influenced poor innocent kids getting infected COVIDs... would likely healthier didn’t 55lbs loose crazy doesn’t mean wrong. one person anti-mask even remotely intelligent reasonable. leader world wants right now, open safe economy, something world leaders desperate  plan getting degree moving here. US sinking ship.  could see happening wore single layer instead folding several times. Lots get infected, 99% survive. worth 250 million die starvation? corona left behind. really looking overall deaths, COVID only. current COVID numbers way obfuscated take truth things getting  Illness without known vaccine vs. Illness probable vaccine. Ah ha! ploy microchip humans get vaccine shown here! *100 percent* reason need microchip you. find way! Shocked. SHOCKED tell you! must cast Corona back fiery chasm whence came. subject masks, yeah definitely. Can't speak Canada, honestly might wearing masks US years. sure people realize that. pro mask always wear one, see catalyst mask wearing stop. Even vax may 50% effective. masks needed, would careful false sense going away soon.  forget Dutch students flooded terrorized Belgian coast weeks back? think covid arrived train? lots less Trump voters too.

Cheap Harleys Trump gone? Win win. end herd immunity. I’m saying situation good, 9 likely explode more, unless school open weeks kids probably already sick contact. haven’t schools long enough caught showed symptoms. takes several weeks time infection. That’s one reason it’s bad. time realize it, you’ve likely already spread it. well, first question made pretty clear theres two different possible risks. so, answer ""yes"" instead reading freaking question, else gonna ask? sorry hear that. Please stay safe - hope easy time it. GG America military spraying citizens pathogens intentionally infecting syphilis ok comes tests consent could save hundreds thousands lives suddenly ""woah slow there"" Every country got covid got infected people arriving planes. That's Brussel though. nearly 800 new cases yesterday across entire country. That's definitly new wave. Meanwhile New Zealand things mostly back normal. Time get hell country data excess deaths? lockdown similar? Thanks! Oceania generally Covid-free, notable exception Melbourne Australia, rest Australia Covid effectively eliminated.


South East Asia also remarkably, exception Indonesia. Yep. People get this. Canada pays parent stay home kids, even non-covid conditions. 

In country dual incomes usually required, people would complain people freeloading, reality better society likely equivalent daycare deduction people get already. I’m UK health care mostly free. get point obviously want family extended family put risk. point I’m making that, like many people put position choose financial security health family. said horrible horrible catch 22 think wise thing person assume every person come contact infected. Neither individual person near absolutely sure status putting others risk. 

Practice standard precautions relative risk infection avoid high-risk situations much possible; including engaging unnecessary public activities. 

Beyond think fair concerned taking precautions, taking haphazardly, higher risk yourself; especially large numbers, closed spaces, close contact.

Assuming someone else ""safe"" risky, assuming *you* ""safe"" others dangerous *and* unethical. Looks like posted around time. Considering weekend, that's still good number.

Also see Okinawa broke single day record again? Obon typhoon 5 hitting them, that's recipe disaster. simple answer: don’t know yet, new unknown virus. studies evidence read long-term complications point early can’t relied on.

That's accurate, 15 years data SARS-1. SARS-2 severe (in attacks lungs, one) - otherwise presentations progression identical. also half century data post-viral infection phases. 


We plenty data, however official recognition would open door kinds future liability claims. 

Remember, first responders suffered post 9-11 syndrome rely act congress medical care help, since ""we know inhaling toxic fumes would lead health issues"" city liable. though, know. lived far instructed open windows health issues associated inhaling toxic air.  


It's reasons &amp; CDC slow recognize airborne spread main route transmission.  


An official warning = Legal Liability = Civil lawsuits damages. 


Yes, know fact large percentage infected SARS-2 never fully recover. like large percentage infected SARS-1 never fully recovered. fine. guess varies area, area enforce masks store give masks one.

I recommend going around lunch time week day can, try go morning. nothing guys. must continue sacrificing children economy. dumb kids spread amongst (since u know.. they’re damn height amongst other).. bring home spread parents give parents hug kiss, talk end day parent reads kid bed time story etc.. one seems think kids bring thing home?? live NZ hear reason eliminate virus. talking land free here, confused chaos. Every day counts. morons media yourself? explicitly justified stood notion large protests ok. Plus early jump false conclusions initial comment? joked schools safe protests (which half intelligent individual would see unsafe illogical risk) would imply I’m schools person. Maybe next time use fucking brain comprehend reason waste time typing, dipshit. don’t think current understanding solid enough make decisions on. month ago , common agreement among institutions aerosol transmission extremely Unimed outside close contact. course feel differently now, really don’t know. quickly forget praising teachers, like rest population, significant portion morons. mean... pride it, sure, always follow either. I'd say went 95% mask compliance 50% hot balls outside. whole, tend care society, though, still money, money, money people charge. (And they're still yelling ""irrashaimase"" every store.) Courage mon ami, wish could help. hear last part lot. sounds like heaven. even economy, appearances. economic recovery virus surges. I’m generally anxious kind person. I’ve often considered marijuana option help relax five minutes. Tried college drunk idea actually feels. I’m glad stigma around marijuana decreasing hoping try someday.

Let’s say 2 (Hollywood Silicon Valley) kind known lack morals humanity. need people show compassion selflessness, US would last place would look. mask protect wearer person??. Japanese least pride following directions, wearing masks, social distancing, yelling (spreading germs) “the nail sticks gets hammered down.” America it’s selfish free middle finger society neighbor. Damn, graduated high school 1990 clothing rule ""no t-shirts alcohol cigarettes"". pretty much it. mean common sense things course, pretty loose. definitely girls short shorts midriff baring shirts then, never stink it. gosh, able focus fine, we'd ogle classes. think found ways automate labor meant could save remaining jobs adults. Mexico. ""with estimates IFR converging approximately 0.5 - 1%"" Americans better stay fuck Canada. don’t want ur kind stupid here. already infect idiots country conspiracy theories don’t need u bringing corona well Well, flu 2-3% convalescent patients inflammation vs. 78% COVID-19 mentioned study. I'd say quite bit difference. way solve put back school act like nothing could ever done anything ever. county Georgia ""Tokyo"" school in? kinda began reading, read comment sounded like given things still seem prudent.

Seatbelts seem unnecessary they’re necessary. you’re wearing them, could die instant. know now, seatbelts invented lot people’s skulls went windshields left seatbelt dangling door rather clip in. Eventually great majority us decided coerced law believe seatbelts worth it, thankfully.

Washing hands using gas pump still worth it, really effective 100% time. don’t wipe groceries, hands *every time* eat.

I trying chastise you, perhaps give little wake shake even though don’t know you, bet lot people would miss dearly fell victim disease. think little caution exercised large segments population; little ""unnecessary fear"" really much problem.

Of course vulnerable going higher risk death. very-very negative outcomes death individual, lasting organic damage, new chronic conditions, spread vulnerable individuals, long recovery times, atypical cases, etc.

Suggesting death outcome anyone concerned glib outcomes short-sighted dispassionate. virus survives better cold weather protective gel-like coating allows survive air passed person person; coating degrades warm found interesting. wonder Covid similar gel coating (lipids). asian countries, lot respect well society general. 

For example, lived Japan years. Things like public bathrooms always clean clean working properly. Public transportation clean, efficient safe.

In America, way. People say ""this thing belong me, dont care nice, functional."" treat shared spaces trash, respect thought next person use it. words describe difference cleanliness bathrooms Japanese American 7-11.

This sense entitlement made mask wearing disease prevention political. People perceive wearing mask unnecessary, inconvenience, choose ""it's right!""

Holy shit people insane... one accounting positive cases havent tested theyre asympyomatic didnt want pay it, reasons? IFR exists. CDC.. also says .005 1.7%.

""The Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR) added Table 1 new parameter value disease severity, replacing Symptomatic Case Fatality Ratio Symptomatic Case Hospitalization Ratio. IFR takes account symptomatic asymptomatic cases may therefore directly measurable parameter disease severity COVID-19."" -CDC  Plot twist: weed cure Covid along Honestly, way handled makes sense they're actually working virus.

We're asking it. /s 278 children died Florida far 2020. *two* due COVID. that's important 276, right? *you* scared it.

How think 276 sets parents feel? Get internet go outside. sun still shining 99.5% Covid patients dying it. Wear mask practice reasonable social distancing fine. Rage prime, yeaaaa might worth it. asinine red herring I’ve seen life believe Ugh stop! leaders this...superintendents?! People chose education life's work it??! mean even peoples evil moment bet year ago idea would side ""dead kids families"" cards down. Hell legacy murder principal death monger superintendent. whichever governors get lucky special mentions letting citizens die. Lots world local leaders remembered death counts only. embarrassing finally something worth remembering ""unnecessarily killed 17 grandparents 14 parents 4 kids forcing kids tuna hallways pandemic."" sure frame newspaper. shortsighted. History remember death cheerleaders legacies currently writing. somewhere else people actively fighting back masks?

Is America influence? Yes, agree. Georgia thing happened, matter study says. Oh god Okay, thanks understand right now. That’s I’m thankful 30k plus testing us all. 

Though ‘ready’ past goalposts think confidence rise. attract exploitative selfish creeds, ensure keep kids well us locals dumber less healthy rest, guess I’ll give ya. 

Plenty money made idiocy. Isn’t constitution instruction manual? nowhere article indicates Chinese propaganda assisted leading Italy locking down.

You still haven’t provide two sources claims made. need ask 3 times? Georgia study way limited draw conclusions transmission. really showed children get badly sick, already knew. least grow add.withoit proper building precautions picking areas less likely flood. AZ drought see people happily build dry wash. actual rain happens least near building gets flooded. wonder dry wash formed. Guessing like parents grandparents much then. can't care patients more. hero ignoring pain, trying brave. applaud tenacity people, take care order take care others. describe it, believe special education teacher. also one wasn’t bilingual presented problems.

Thanks information. went high school, things different I’m always happy update knowledge viewpoints based reality. doomed, stay away idiots. Let virus work. We'll better maskless mouth-breathers start drop off. I’m going guess 19/19 survive barley symptoms. Yes Mr Trump say incredible good [European Commission president] also issued veiled criticism U.S. efforts buy stocks vaccine might prove effective, vowing EU work provide access everyone “irrespective live.”

Any country attempts monopolize covid vaccine **evil**, deserves condemned everybody. Europeans afraid criticizing United States? 

Imagine Russians attempt monopolize vaccine like Americans trying do. would reaction be? shrimp-sized blob person, fucking idiot.  cheaper rebuild every 5-10 years? often damaged point repair, torn down? extra costs displaced people, heathcare costs floods, urgent mobilization army etc. aid areas disasters stike? 

I numbers support claim, yours. current situation akin 3 little pigs thier little straw house. Reason tells keep things, keep results. Failing means tried something succeed.

Seeing never even tried stop virus - infact encouraged spread, would say succeeding biggly. bbq pool area apartment complex closed 5 months rent still fucking Disneyland open.

Fucking unreal. tragic thing needn’t either/or: observe public health guidelines healthy economy. Florida, could ***and saved lives*** 😷 see there

Don’t go doesn’t misinformation maple syrup now; trees fine work profession.

Can't everyone understand important take care Lockheed Martin making sure folks get evicted food??? still buy alcohol 8 bars. 3 usually, Friday set limit midnight argue drunk people can't behave. Combine good weather, end holidays, months celebratory news there's new cases Norway, general tiredness everything Corona get private parties. would *increase* likelihood death? might give false sense security would lead infections increase deaths *overall*, wouldn’t increase likelihood death individual people. chance death higher recieve vaccine, others recieved it. Seems great European travel summer 2020 bad idea. Starting without Korea-like quarantine testing system place blunder.

Most states literally try get back old normal schools govt exactly enforces 0 distancing mask rules workplaces w/o customer contact.

I fear got overconfident low case numbers lockdown. people always infatuation ""being scared"" ""fearful"" virus? fear, common sense taking precautions. feel need act ""brave"" shit? Newsflash idiots, virus. fucking animal that's going run away act tough. give fuck whether ""afraid"" it, infect regardless. Damn people stupid. funny following sub, know scientists. 
  
The study released yet, we'll wait see, specifically deferring scientists? Covid never gone States. much population helps keep going. I'm surprised heard before, also seem issue vaccines? (Someone correct I'm wrong.) read remarks researcher question, they're one saying would wise cautious believe wholeheartedly. research see experts say subject. take anyways, even work well, still might offer protection! Every privacy law planet exclusions. Typically first “important national security issue”, often horribly exploited totally wrong reasons. second common exclusion emergencies, vital interests data subjects fighting threat public health, as, let’s say pandemic random example.
So no, privacy law (in USA, Canada, Brazil, EU, Argentina, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Russia, wherever) blocks usage personal data purposes fighting life threatening diseases. It’s spread teachers potential long term effects appear severe covid prevalent. People need stop comparing covid flu. Yes, flu give people long term issues well, levels seeing covid. Covid tendency attack far systems body flu.  think you’ve swapped Japanese Saiyan. happens us lot foreigners. want measurable way tell they're good job protecting kid not,"" said Jeff Anderson, whose two sons attend school Evansville. 

Some parents want believe measures protect kids school.

There isn't. going spread quickly especially amongst young kids. Oh yeah, Sturgis people bikes go cosplay 1% bikers week return cubicles. can't peer reviewed evidence finished end 2020 thing, that's timeline Warp Speed pushing. Also, matter think. thing independent thought. things think others tell articles, what's point human? Wisconsin. live open since gop sued governor.

Quit melodramatic. think Aliens read Reddit handles decided lurk. country, schoold open since May like that. went well. Sometimes schools closed sick people though.

However, much, much less corona around USA. get infected constantly USA. live teachers write IEPs Question posed Bill Gates

People surprised unlike countries hardly questioned customs entering US

Gates. virus wide spread US anyone entering country likely bringing infection rate Americans get shit posting America sub - actually know people live countries? friends England, Italy, Spain, they've gone back living normal lives. People taking vacations, adults back office, kids back school, much mask wearing social distancing going on. covering costs? covering actual treatment? guess are? Upvotes comment adds something discussion. Downvotes don't, I'm pretty sure agreeing falls category. politically biased subreddit, reddit intended be. Rules mean nothing love can't grasp fucking fact people countries tend wears masks less COUNTRY FULL FUCKING COVID god damn sense lock shit down.

There whopping 3 deaths entire province far, cases like... months. course people wear masks less, we're fucking apocalyptic wasteland like America is. shit.

populism killed us pandemic. You’re wrong. admit it. It’s fault. need tourists. 

Tourists coming. city live bought house low lying areas turned park areas reduce damage happens. Ah yes, Fox news, known accurate unbiased reporting. Nope, even going bother read headline. Provide proper source, preferably study.

Actually read article instead making presumptions. It’s news report many direct quotes interviews officials, Sean Hannity Many states require people wear masks public. little chance going change.

They absolutely should, don’t, need enforce average class size America 21 students. room distance students other. schools countries pretty much closed infection rates high.

If give families choice whether in-person classes not, number probably go since many opt stay home. even slightly distance students universal mask usage, odds infection far lower. countries reopened schools without significant problem. lol response Insanity isn’t disability neuroatypicality.

Lol  Oooooo... Great question. one. HOWEVER, Rage Machine would closest yes. ""“The gradual uptick cases shown us we’ve reached – already exceeded – absolute limits easing restrictions,” writes. “The R value, tells many people get virus contact infected person, close 1. worrying signs we’re danger heading wrong direction.

I’ll upvote bravery :) Radiohead Covid clearly different though. 60% children age 6-16 cross reactive antibodies prevalence antibodies much much lower age group.

And ignoring biology, studies like Greek one looked household transmission also conclude children seem spread anywhere near levels adults.

I'll admit made plenty mistakes topic betters topic corrected misconceptions. new conspiracy theory me.

Here triage guideline Banner Health speaks per AZ DHS, place state win since beginning 

Where mentioned implied requires hospitals turns away edge cases? Let alone cases resources stretched?

But again, keep forgetting late night r/coronravirus. Silly me. Funny, recall health professionals walking around outdoors grocery stores mask. I'm sorry, form alternative childcare involve close contact human beings? Grocery store employees wrote obits months ago.... going believe? Scientists study test stuff former MTV Real World contestant, even one good season? many states arent debt right populated? quarantine anyone class anyone 9 students? teachers?

Alternatively, shut fuck up. Yes, also underreported COVID cases.

Why would even argue article name named COVID? almost like suggestion super basic anyone researching deaths though it.

There 8x much death pneumonia years years before.

Look life fairy tale. Resources arent divided evenly. pretend first world mustache twirling villains something third world nations don't.

I'm fine rich countries get first, that's things work. long cost manufacturing driven haves buy nots after. way happens, rich nations send billions dollars worth vaccines third world nations every year.

There people would rather one vaccine everyone get treated equally. Let's get many people vaccinated fast possible even rich folk pay front line. must health sciences magnet school. I'd guess windows open air circulation would much better reducing viral load surroundings. That’s terminate pandemic. Maybe principal get......a new attitude protect students issue average joe may wear improperly, may touch often touch surfaces feel protected may discard social distancing.

I'm still confused world's largest PSA safe mask use, legitimate concern.

* Wash sanitize hands handling mask
* touch mask hands unless putting removing it
* Keep nose &amp; mouth matter (even talking)
* eat drink situation need mask
* Wash, dispose of, quarantine three days mask done wearing it
* Keep mask talking, coughing, sneezing. remove done wearing it
* Continue practice social distancing. Masks risk reduction technique, like wearing seat belt. Wearing seat belt mean safely speed, wearing mask mean safely hang near others Face eating leopards everywhere days  global pandemic. one safe everyone safe. It’s smart took job.

Thanks post. found informative someone something factually refutes OP I'd love hear (and wall links papers fully understand). Viruses DGAF. Wow. America reason pandemic getting worse globally? Canada getting better every week. hardly even call epidemic here. It’s basically disease that’s spreading tracked. Oh God, 200,000 people died years before, pneumonia, pulmonary diseases like COVID, absolutely relations whatsoever COVID! Yep Exactly this. Good job NZ! make urns art class. Wow edgy fat. kidding.

Acceptable excuse. ;) Alternative childcare doesn’t spread covid? straight delete Facebook shit, otherwise I'd really friends this. many attitudes towards pandemic selfish, ignorant just...mean spirited.

Best health struggle mess!  I’m definitely getting flu shot early! kids. Hubby required job anyway. need worry flu well covid. wish fewer dummies like yourself. [reminds old parable agree.

The CDC already recommending people sick wear masks prevent household spread.

The CDC also already knew significant risk presymptomatic &amp; asymptomatic cases. in, sick people. people wearing masks, know it.

The logical conclusion everyone wear mask. need info back February know that.

It's better put recommendation late rather never, disagree enough information early make right call. prefer saving best last. Sacrifice children LINE Google things you? takes less 10 seconds find I'm talking There's reason [this scene exists. [this shitty ass computer might good stuff here, ain't saint.

Sneaky. She’s cute die young :’( That’s exactly they’ll do. Covid testing suddenly harder get, die listed flu pneumonia deaths. really killing kids, though concern. Kids carry [10-100x virus adults do, follow directions social distancing masks.

Some kids die. sucks. sucks causing another wave killing parents, teachers, community members. also other. Kids viral stealth bombs, asymptomatic, sneezing everything, unable follow basic directions keeping others safe.

And we've discussed point, kids still dying Covid! Florida getting better, lag deaths, data skewed, something else going now? math check out. Like I'm confused confused. like thing 10 times more. Well happen 10 times more. Darwin wins again. It’s cut it’s deferral. still pay it, don’t pay won’t pay interest. Victoria Stage 4 lockdown now. government gives fuck love it. did. Omega oof.  Yngve Gustafson laughable point. First claims ‘it’s active euthanasia’ it’s ‘forced isolation’. 

That said agree mental heath concern addressed(Which believe will). Reading following comments, it’s unfortunate everyone got reference richest thrid world country strikes again. I’m curious see number deaths America ends 2020 versus average/expected number deaths. 

I remember Wall Street journal researching Day 150 15 days slow spread. great example real country real government citizens care. What’s Spaniah? laid back version Pariah? live USA but. son 5 years old goes pre-primary school ratio children teachers 5-1, strict rules symptom screen children parents every morning drop afternoon pick temperature checks.
 Children get hands washed several times day social distancing classrooms. pandemic refused entry kids cold flu ramped up. live area almost cases province live currently 10k active cases. 
The school open month 1 case found children, teachers parents. 
Every single person country wears mask public stores temperature check force sanitizer entry. playing POGs “gambling” remember free suspected cases (citizens foreigners), mandatory (paid not, I'm sure) everyone flying in.

But know numbers generally accurate cause hospitals filled brim Covid patients

There private screening options pay for. Democrats control Congress. saw Facebook page, linked website title. seen anything official I'm going assume nonsense hear otherwise Despite increasing COVID19 flu essentially eradicated Australia due increased social distancing mask wearing. It’s middle winter here. mean do. 

You clearly think you’re good guy too. 

As life. Yup. Check post: Fuck off. vote POS seems hellbent killing us. Depends wording honestly. vaccine gone normal testing process takes amount time normal vaccination came today 1/3 American people didn’t take it, they’re morons. vaccine development less year cane today 1/3 American people didn’t take it, find pretty reasonable. 

Vaccines take lot time perfect made safe people injected with. makes sense cautious want run potential avoidable health risks. 

But, isn’t ladder, 100% agree 1/3 incompetent morons mate like economy, things get shut one way another. difference taking planned route chaotic route... figure one better. 70% population live Central Belt alone lol, yes terms land mass sparsely populated vast majority Scots live areas dense England's cities. “Kids days”.

Some people report mild reactions flu vaccination. common side effects flu shots soreness, redness, tenderness swelling shot given. Low-grade fever, headache muscle aches also may occur. reactions occur, usually begin soon shot last 1-2 days. randomized, blinded studies, people get inactivated flu shots others get salt-water shots, differences symptoms increased soreness arm redness injection site among people got flu shot. differences terms body aches, fever, cough, runny nose sore  Didn’t kid took photo get suspended? going shitshow.

China closes schools small outbreak city really tell something. cases can’t resist 2 weeks, 18th September far away living significant failure public common sense political responsibility US history - cannot imagine many people stupid long similar levels death ever - aliens watching, galactic brotherhood good. ever make movie aliens land first Washington - give hard ""NO"" move somewhere adults active - one scandi countries, Germany NZ. suppose forgetting man hugely intelligent many ways, even ways stupid. know am, I? $1200 300 million americans, small minority unemployment insurance keep getting paid, albeit much less entirely states pay (meaning wont happen). 

But sure, let's pretend people actually helped this. Chances slim reinfection, example:
Germany 80000 detected cases four months ago, permille population. factor unknown cases estimated around 3 5.

Now, around 800 cases per day detected.
Not counting behavioral changes like becoming less cautious first infection test, see something like one two cases per week, reinfection possible four months.

Looking antibody studies, seems somewhat likely smaller fraction reinfected four months, time watch first cases detected, least Germany.

For frontline workers hospitals, detection rate exposure much higher, tiny minority compared general population. putting kids risk sake economy.

And parents, parent's coworkers, etc.

Kids might lose parent two, hey, fuck ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ hope like time forecasted 81k August 4 August 4 came nearly 159k? Well post regarding children isn’t it? thing implication is. It’s start. fully agree. people refuse understand even make attempt understand pandemic unknown virus kills people leave lung, heart damage life, it.

Giving manner hurts everyone. educated subject, sorry. American government hasn’t worked people long time  know what’s sad comment know someone family immediate family thinks Soros tied everything. 

I wish way bet stupidity average American. Regarding issues haha.  sounds terrifying. reporting, covid antibodies stick around months, wait long test may never know. students agreed take part hoax.

The SNP made mistakes don’t try pretend done good job. Schools can't even deal common cold lice, fuck expect deal covid..... best. slowed down. Don’t forget tested much. September’s far away know anything. haul shark water throw friends family? Trump literally asked Obama covid-19 tests president Probably based whatever mood teacher/counselor/etc day.

“Oh yep! definitely look 5%. Suspension!!”

And even student able figure percent attempt explain/show this, would call smart mouth. Umm... people charge want crisis delay election.

Yes know ""can't"" stopped last 4 years? Yea ego rolled now. Someone important need die sheer volume deaths/infections need reach like 50% school population. I'm restaurant employee come work get fired become homeless.


My boss allows servers walk around noses mask simply pull pretty much anytime all. Norway -291 literally asked Obama covid-19 test.



Jesus tapdancing christ. gotta hand dems, they’re organised enough get every country world work together pretend virus exists republicans. That’s pretty damn impressive went continuation school small town, mostly way high level gang stuff. tiny campus(read: 4 small portable buildings one actual also small building) like 50 kids tops. probation, varying levels risk. 

No red, blue. Raiders branded anything, LA branded anything. 13/14/18/88, etc. Fubu, Southpole, etc, also no. sagging pants hanging belts, god help they're colored anyway. socks pulled shorts. Girls leave purses office, bet ass searched it. backpacks, also needed. sweatshirt hoods worn half head. sunglasses back head. dickies pants except jeans. Absolutely visible tattoos possible, face hands basically exception. RIP found bandana. gang colors drug related decals shoelaces kind.

Oddly really care much ""revealing"" girls clothing. Spaghetti straps, visible tummy's fine. think requirement bra skirts/dresses end knee. went boys, could wear tank top, shorts, flip flops wanted. Provided tattoos visible. 

They saw raiders jersey *underneath* hoody, barely noticeable. taken rest day despite undershirt, actually tried claim lost pointed saw principles office window. suspended belt buckle small pot leaf center it. 

Clothing restrictions get wild sometimes. Well, twisted perspective.

Right little Johnnie home. home, either

A) one parent stay home him

or

B) put little Johnnie daycare.

Let's look outcome A. One parent stay home work babysit day. (That assuming cannot work home, might case sometimes.) parent pretty much permanently workforce little Johnnie turns 12 13 stay home without burning house down, vaccine comes out. parent working, also factory anyone assemble widgets. Worker shortage. Side effect: economy restart, parents much less disposable income spend stuff, economy grow.

Now let's look option B: Anyone done daycare, even hours day school, tell absurdly expensive is. assume enough daycare available cover students (it isn't) assume afford (they can't - exceed cost one income)... outcome same. parents going flat broke, economy cannot grow.

So Republicans looking bottom line saying ""the way get elected run jobs economy"" ""the job situation abysmal, jump start economy"". way perspective.

About way could relative could watch Johnnie day. retired aunt granny living you, would work. homelessness hit, may see resurgence multi-generational housing. heard figure quoted 230k 1 November. wipe air alcohol-damp cloth smh, hard be? restaurant employee safe beginning.

Multinational Corporate Socialism thee, rugged capitalism U.S. runs even Global Pandemic... noted future reference. I’m sure it’ll miraculously go away April bit worrying report based recent increase infection rates mostly due [Young adults account majority new covid-19 cases past three weeks. Undoubtedly one reason authorities keep reminding people pandemic stay vigilant follow recommendations.

Speaking bands. classmate wore Bad Religion t-shirt.

One teachers thought anti-Christianity shirt sent office.  Trying find direct source number, cannot find information people died? shouldnt put anyone ""died covid"" category without testing posotive covid. Everyone kind decided reason. World already going shit, w/ anti-intellectualism sent us death-spiral. Anyone neglecting wear mask tased spot. conveniently, Florida's Covid-19 deaths dipping, pneumonia deaths spiking.

(Make sure click state button Florida fact, pretty much every state dip deaths recently logical reason big bump pneumonia deaths. appears creepy come. Flu shots many Coronaviruses &amp; schools encourage jab maths 👀 everyone would benefit Universal health care. Social Security failed system mismanaged misused government. again, please stop trying spread clear disinformation Hey, there’s danger going around can’t see, may way know. You’ll feel fine still hurt others.

It requires act faith.

While politicians practiced progressive information disclosure effective airlines “15 minutes” delay announcements. “Flatten curve!” went flat. change restrictions. said COVID “opportunity” (Jay Inslee, governor WA). Going outside killing grandma, unless protest cause. 

Not kind thing generates faith.

Toss Trumps massive screwup lack leadership federal level get perfect storm. Making comment prove pointless comparing two different statistics is. That's incredible watched live-cams bit. Lots type 2 trikes. 

I hope like ventilators prone. Good. video there’s little defence have. prediction: Sept 1 blowing shut down. course tons kids mostly late. 

Basically, thing happened everywhere else america. seriously hope satire I’m already working home, social distancing, cancelled 99% events, wearing mask grocery store. would even catch flu? many Americans selfish, they're also stupid. Oof. Edited accuracy Same. don’t understand “masks = saving lives others” hard grasp.

Even eat healthy, live healthy, there’s chance could suffer heart lung problems long virus passed. That’s data... Trump told getting sick matter. dead people matter. 

Wait no, dead people matter either.

Money. 230 million 11.5% population, means 88.5% population poverty definition ""case""? mean 9 people tested positive? person arguing 88 end name. Google ""88 Nazi"". see actually arguing good faith sad, denial control. think anyway country moves past crazy time?

You’re gonna go every scientist world say coronavirus isn’t even virus? I’m sorry even thought worth expressing definitely worth debating. 

I’m shocked even make article say 5G covid related appearently people stupid enough believe it. Can't believe upvoted someone username, strange times. Guessing infections happened pictures showed school bad light. Ok. No. again, tested positive, account 5 million positive cases, doesnt mean ones infected. include infection rate get idea many people total America corona right now. 5 million know. whats mathematical assumption give us guesstimate total active ""positive cases"". Thats use IFR instead CFR determine mortality. 

Your math accounting X. X = # active positive cases walking around Corona speak. accounting people got tested. 10 millon positive cases active right now, excluding half numbers arent confirmed, factually inaccurate math looks scarier is. Man Americans fucking embarrassing. Trump continuously disputes facts promotes falsehoods. failed lead country meaningful directives. federal leadership, governor state come plans. Every state thing, chaotic confusing.  
Worse yet, states Democratic governors experienced enormous defiance Republican politicians (and Trump) trying undermine authority governorship.  
These actions effectively confused, angered, divided people.  
So every time need buy groceries put gas car, never know expect. Even stores clearly state masks required may lots customers enter masks defiantly pull chins. It’s truly awful. Well, uh, go school. are. Add cases deaths together world one side vs American cases deaths “are better whole world”.... least time being. non-Tagalog speakers here, guy’s last name sounds like “fart” Filipino. Hm, good obviously let’s look numbers (according CDC). 1 hundredth one percent deaths due COVID occur 5-18 age group. We’re going see half million positive tests (510,000) demographic see another death.

Granted doesn’t address demographic’s impact carriers let’s real numbers show kids safer covid significant number threats there. let’s stop pretending returning school we’re pro-children-genocide. It’s easy force kids wear masks, that’s excuse try (really shouldn’t person classes yet imo) to, something faculty staff say. there’s “no point trying enforce it’s hard” students allowed come school underwear well please much this.

It's young nation, doubt change better. They're still flanderizing. Recently, yes. 90s progressively less 2000s Disney World different schedules, pricing programming available depending whether high low season. remember 90's even fireworks major parades shows season. phantasmic, electric night parade, fireworks all, etc. started fireworks one parks night, eventually night, parades year round certain celebrations, etc. pretty much year round exception stuff closed refurbishment season really low more. Iran covid facility caught fire, Russia covid facility caught fire. Hmmmm Yeah, it’s 120+ schools mix public private. schools distributed across states red blue governors. course exert influence, arrows influence point multiple conflicting directions. Putting American teacher's income global surprisingly, almost visible positive correlation teacher income % GDP per capita economic growth. Hi, welcome Las Vegas!  Hillary would lose 2020 landslide hates freedumb ~~economy~~ stock market. It’s absolutely terrifying. They’ll give social scammer old calls health agency pandemic. Yeah would awesome people know lot viruses spread could consult with. It'll go away own, see. ""Eventually I'll right."" Taiwan never gets respect deserves CCP one started comparison, told main difference, open vs closed space. Gawrsh Mickey, think opened pandemic? number infections likely many times greater testing indicates, current death rates minors likely 1 every 5000 infections, most. 

The teachers ones need protection. Virus? Fuck spaghetti straps! reading this. Super spreader situation anyone? really defy expectations? tells Elon Musk pyramids built aliens"" Picking experience. takes two years learn put fruit basket gently instead throwing directly ground shoving ass. Fuck em. Let rich fail. money must flow. People going get virus. Duh reddit, interesting, I'm software engineer. went many years unemployment/going back grad school got started, know people go through.

It's different culture, we're workaholics here. meet Europeans, tell take tons vacation, obviously make less. I'd make lot less working job. Even daily things, like grocery stores limited hours there, restaurants closing hours they're supposed enough customers, Americans would perceive lazy. Even now, local store closing 11 PM due COVID (instead 1 AM), sometimes get little annoyed.

Even good spot, I'm still tempted retire early, move abroad, worry whole nest egg wiped medical problem retirement.

I agree America good place making lot money (enough FIRE least). Every time read long time effects virus, think word “sequelae”: 
a condition consequence previous disease injury. people understood!! know compare one pic one school thousands pics hundreds protests across country. I'm starting think, well maybe need fight morons. tip around them. opinions beliefs dont fall step science shut learn get fuck That's weird, vaccine polonium it. Oopsy doodle really think total 338k confirmed cases Covid children, somehow almost third occured last 2 weeks? Really guys? Hopefully told sadly I’m sure Especially since missing ribs means lungs extra vulnerable Republican caused arson. find next week. Yeah, honest average American possess knowledge politics work make educated decision. essentially boils popularity contest personal bias. go make Mr Handy Ok, let say that. end? virus ever gone whats acceptable number new cases per day us fully reopen? 10,000? 5,000? 1,000? Thats problem dude, one answers. Everyone wants shut everything one plan reopen partial reopen. I'm fine schools virtual, need date set kids go back classroom setting. someone reasonably perform duties job home without decreasing productivity company thats fine well. I'd like see law requiring mask image really necessity, vast majority country already wearing masks situations. Even law 100% compliance worth hassle. far contact tracing, already that. I'm fine shutting things knew sure would help, though helped us far. we're going shut things need plan reopen preferably mandatory date businesses schools fully reopened. Whether thats 2 months 6 months makes difference longest could reasonably go 6 months now. point almost year living like this, longer reasonable. may saying close years, mentality closing goes away would lead years shutdown shutdown stop spread virus here.

The things people forget we've everything every country done. There's really understandable reason numbers keep rising, distance, wear masks, actually test anyone. luck out. Influenza rapid tests available home use either reason: they’re insensitive. Many workers ~~undocumented~~ illegal

FTFY people charge know, care lie everyone. Shocker WashU chance? (It would awfully relevant was) keep stressing because. someone dies heart attack Covid would say that’s disease? strong evidence Covid greatly increases clotting cause heart attacks. thing strokes. draw line with? Im trying beat it’s honest question.

As far 60 question it’s roughly 20% total deaths. It’s without doubt worse older unhealthy people. 

I feel need stress lot people 30’s 40’s sick enough hospitalized require oxygen. let get point hospitals run (mine close right now) people able get care death rate increase.

FTFY Replace senile greedy Uh no, scientifically proven advice available January even, ""politics"" chose ignore it. 

Please stop mischaracterizing sides much spread many disincentives likely distance learn anyway, think it’s wishful thinking.

For people it’d novelty.  many get false negatives decent chunk getting positives fake well. CDC also estimate extra 200k deaths (which would already put us pretty much 300k)? remember adolescent. plan best least get upset would've fine happened way begin with.

...but ignorant kid. great idea next time want get joint festival. schools enforce distancing.

A lot private schools can’t afford it. 

They already tight budgets running parents say “if you’re going remote schooling, bother sending kid go public school free?” surprised school used 3 inch note card measure skirt allowable student sent home 100+ times year. agree you, assume worst proven otherwise dangerous disease. lol France problems bruh. That’s reassuring, least. Yes we’re talking confirmed case covid belong 1 5 million tested. 5 million positive 162k died, meaning belong confirmed cases group 3.5% chance dying.

Now looking total population 331 million yes absolutely 162k /331m gives extremely small chance dying disease. chance dying covid mortality rate two different discussions. I'm sending 7 year old back school right now. He's already ahead classmates, putting risk going disruptive learning environment detrimental development. feel completely helpless this, mom educator, shy 60. lost dad last year, thought losing mom giving nightmares. sexy girls doubt bared shoulders enticed innocent boys come close. girls newest form super spreaders. Like arms bc carried away? Imagine profit could twice many kids got sick, hopefully next week someone think investors. basically ignore reason died let happen grandparents well. Got it! Fuck school (dont worry, Im student cant suspend me) many old people wont make 2022. something I've accepted.  don’t time research candidates who’s pockets they’re 40 hour minimum work weeks sick leave vacation. sure *worst* place anymore. cleaning public place, stricter enforcement regulations regarding masks distancing.

I almost felt bad them, sucked wasted time, so... believe rules followed, got bad news them. Yeah, numbers turned out, checked numbers making first comment. based 20% population infected though, that's pretty big assumption know 1% population like confirmed cases, 10, 20, 60%. 

Still 1-2% entire population stretch, Stockholm 0.24% population died. maybe 0.1% low, would still say 0.5-1% population max. 

New York 0.224% population die. 

Lombardy 0.157% 

Seems around cap out. long term side effects? Quit ignorant. Okay, I’ll bite.

But people still dying alarming rate virus still don’t know much way contained. Sometimes username hurtful ;)  Still, sounds like making argument outdoor events completely safe everyone mostly everyone masked. 

No. I'm saying outdoor events **safer** everyone mostly everyone masked. said nothing sort. stated numerical facts death counts. Babies. Fucking kidding me. really going take holding dead kids grandkids hands finally fucking get it? pivot say Lord fucking took them? Depends many people beach, guess. stacked like sardines there, great prevent cases. Oh sure, late change what's already happened, country needs band together stop getting worse.

That's probably wishful thinking based death toll countries struggling either leveled stopped completely, doable work together.

Wear mask, stop going places go, keep away people crowds, numbers level protests overwhelmingly masked. involved battle charged machine gun turret bunkers boats..... Agreed pandemic , story could said rock band played front big crowd practicing social distancing even wearing mask .but coward name Chris band could point finger shame . whole argument kills young children, least, garbage argument consider subjecting percentage complications may life ultimately shorten lifespan. VAGINA_BLOODFART new first favorite expletive. Thank you. end result American exceptionalism. People reminded ""individual rights"" long, important society's collective rights. yeah masks uncomfy ""Only drop ""I'm dismissing anything want see ""dismissive"" need look certain Americans keep harping day WWII sacrifices. narrative that's particularly perpetuated Hollywood degree even US institutions start believing tall tales

You seem particularly upset US, look reason justify it. story *French* give USSR credit, French publication blames Hollywood French ignorance? mistweet ambassadors staff?

Keep nursing grudge. go minute 40 mark video story, that’s part they’re talking home tests sent parents. That’s mom child home. protests overwhelmingly masked. There’s scientific study proves oven mitts work. Deeper. Please put head deeper sand, can't hear me. Alternatively, get ones shewees (or another pee funnel) pee standing up! people put effort criticism blm protests,rational humans would take seriously, then,you look like hypocritical morons, entertaining say least. Trump approves vaccine shortly elections doubt available quickly. guess Trump would order first doses go senior citizens. could certainly valid medical risk/benefit choice. Trump benefit would make seniors (his reliable supporters) comfortable going polls pandemic. 

And first doses would get delivered Florida swing states. know many people Key West Orlando dependent tourist economy dollars? pandemic last forever. course *now* they’re going allow it. majority party concerned getting voted office. they’ve begun process sabotaging postal service, they’ll effectively suppressing millions votes, primarily opposition party. mean yeah. already approaching 170k August half over. ""official numbers"" want heavy, gun throttle. “Loud pipes save lives”... sure, maybe busy highway, don’t think worry driver’s blind spots 20mph road bury throttle.

/s Brazil publish data overall excess deaths? Moderna oxford current administration. trial data public vaccine comes market. Go listen actual virologists/epidemiologists instead journalistic interpretations pre prints reddit comments. Phase 3 won’t show anything month vaccine public won’t. Plus people likely get old, health care workers, people money. There’ll chance see take anyways. side effects would worried complications years road. least anyone debilitating side effects immediately shut trial down. Given fact 30,000 people participating feel like there’ll good probability we’ll see happen it’s issue.   Also delay someone diagnosed vs die. see case count started rising June death count start rising July. lasts longer year? couple years? vaccine come along? I’m saying can’t attribute every excess death dying covid. It’ll next year. one time I'm totally alone feel comfortable....sober. bike. posted photo Walmart rumors prove true covid bind carbon monoxide air, winter much deadlier anticipated. dare enter room toxic levels pm2.5. Ah see Outside events better inside events something. wearing helmet safe lol. growds good. understand though process however. want human interaction outside air. Give Liberty Give Dea... Yep, ""met"" tons bikers yesterday, waved passed other, brief moment social interaction without risks getting COVID-19. people ride! Exactly. set go retail weekend. First store enter, full family without masks. turned around walked right out. guess want money? Honestly think one biggest blunders calling ""social distancing"".

People like ""oh ok still fine social near people just, like, try coughing distance"".

Should called Physical Isolation. whole 6 feet thing absurdly close kind indoor spread know virus (and virus matter!) goes. Oh, pedo-panic Right crazy, kind like Satanic-panic 80s. think every Democrat pedophile, every celebrity pedophile, pedos lurking behind every tree waiting pounce.

Calm down, lady. kid's hot. case actually lot company:

Sweden, Peru, Brazil, Chile pretty well fire virus, Brazil passing us. Mexico blowing pretty bad too.

Keep border closed bit Canada. Long term vision vs short term profits, climate change problem.

Those us want solved going much costly destructive don't, we're mean long-term vision sake it, seems see it. don’t remember people saying virus, knew early risk could test positive coronaviruses due remnants.

However, apply pregnancy tests - mean still can’t miscarry though.  parent comment says *with* lockdown, paper says without. Lol, already that. often looked much Soviets asked aid Germany yet ignored US. oversimplifying - US policy isolation start war aid initially provided countries willing pay it. lend-lease enacted start shipping aid Russia (they second largest recipient behind UK).

Aid also sent June 22, 1941 September 30, 1941 lend-lease enacted - i.e. starting day Hitler broke nonaggression pact! sending aid point officially Germany Russia pact busy carving Poland Barbarossa.

As ignoring total, U.S. deliveries USSR Lend-Lease amounted $11 billion materials: 400,000 jeeps trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, 1,386[54] M3 Lees 4,102 M4 Shermans);[55] 11,400 aircraft (4,719 Bell P-39 Airacobras)[56] 1.75 million tons food.

That's huge volume military aid time supporting allies preparing war east. considering level medical technology, would embarrassing people died pandemic 100 years ago

The numbers already embarrassing. read DisneyWorld cutting back operating hours. Next month they'll opening later closing earlier. Studies coming viral load children much greater adults. Even asymptomatic. ""super spreaders"". Older faculty dropping like flies. Give month. Classes started quite yet, students definitely moving Like shemagh similar? looked one go mask bought neck gaiters similar reason. Ended buying 3-layer mask filter slot packed carbon filter wrap blue workshop towel (tested one efficient home materials filtration) Yes like also know many live farming community. big industrial farms bring people like this. supervisors equipment people American . everyone else’s working low wages aren’t. So, total cases 5x-10x confirmed cases average, probably 5 10%, might even halfway there. lived Missouri, locals told knew people never left *their county.* Absolutely blew mind. I'd curious see studies false sense security phenomenon. thing said false negatives PCR tests.

I think given situation we're large amount people primed educated proper behavior tests. could actually get hurdles producing distributing lage numbers things, seems infection detection would far better now. World/universe 6000 years old (Bible). Maybe shut whore mouth :) Based population density I'm sure possible hit total number infections 2 year period, especially considering much easier move around world back 1918.

That said, something said level medical technology. free range movement around world level medical technology 1918, I'm willing bet death toll would astronomical.

But good treating disease, even ones new, I'd surprised death toll surpasses 1918 pandemic, doubly vaccine rushed even somewhat effective little side effects I'm one said he's literally donating money ya b**tlicker. Tell Cajuns India massive population mostly young lower risk, virus hard track due massive amount asymptomatic cases spread. Inpatients declined 2% 1659 1626. dropped 33 patients. HOWEVER, total 364 discharges. means inpatient number decline 33, 331 new people hospitalized offset discharges increase 41% day before. That's daily hospitalization number. also track share 7 day trend daily hospitalization went 4%. cut corners tell people they’re negative? would terrible. 

Too many positives absolutely issue though. one businesses can’t afford everyone gets tested stop working pay home. 

Saying would better everyone received positive whether insanity financial fall would mean catastrophe. One man said two elderly family members virus, believes likely exposed church.  know fact that’s really place go they’re around bunch people, direct contact one ministers tested positive,” man said.   said family made aware 18 church members tested positive virus.  understand, it’s least 30. concerning part church abiding social distancing guidelines know weren’t stopping services watching primarily elderly congregation,” man said. Oh boo hoo. Let get violin. Wish well, partner. wear mask keep social distance possible others. would really nice right. Sad thing probably closer 50 million more..... Question: phase 3 trial Oxford vaccine expected completed? Murdoch media referring not-yet-published study help BoJo.

What surprise. /s Essential must defined clearly spelled out. Lockdown neither mentioned described wall text. real reading comprehension problem going think. Well get tested. Testing shit storm, luckily yet unlikely school system set system. sounds like natural reaction stress stomach roils couple times day. bus driver doctor. sympathy best wishes. agree fair share morons, another issue many put risk NEED work. safety nets country reserved wealthy. Healthcare tied jobs. People need relief get country. choice put danger works Freedomland. Yes vaccine work new life I'm surprised disappointed nobody dressed Scorpion, Ghostface, Spiderman, Elmo, etc pandemic.

Schools taking test get F. Me? I'm Canadian, living Germany. Yep, keep insisting right congregate, act surprised outbreak Covid. Maybe study data.

Here latest case/charts Hamilton county, plus running 7-day Honestly I'm afraid kinda start care anymore. I'm Germany, bad good weather last days beaches full, many people one place. Many vacation dangerous areas, ignore recommendations start hear often bad previous believed. hope en situation. believe tales town crier bestows upon thou person - people dying pox.  
Nay! simply unbalance humors good bloodletting bring good health! 

*So late maybe 5 redditors read this, I’ll never ever let chance use word “humors” old-school way pass ;)* 
*Also, could, I’d give extra upvote use “miasma.”* going graduate economy that's absolutely fucked. Dealers choice. Absolutely not... certainly beginning massive looting, first all.

And then, even within couple weeks ago, “protestors” “wearing masks” pulling yell old ladies trying eat lunch far I’m concerned that’s beyond trashy, yelling faces old ladies pandemic attempted murder. Mom around age would lose shit video, easily could been.

Just shut fuck up. obviously don’t know you’re talking want justify facile false narrative. America Muslim allies well. Wouldn’t say mission rid world Muslims. oh yeah schools open we're fucked Huh today learned. conservative side family would use proof liberal places heathen lol. Hasn’t like 2 days? Remember cared citizens economy. Remember presidents common sense. Remember Americans common sense. remember lots things. Pepperidge Farms remembers. Somebody told don’t like leave well guess Robert can’t cause CANT GO ANYWHERE CAUSE ORANGE JESUS FUCKED BAD CANT EVEN LEAVE GET DIE STUPID ASS CAUSE WONT WEAR MASK. come Covid church service. guess point Biden wins peaceful transition power, US failed. also choose guy's dead bike.

(Miss mine too!) doubt half, probably wording poll questions Yes less fear potential side effects. moron, stop talking I'm using facts argument, quote referring here, dummy? professionals agree me, cited above. know bad way look issue? 

By using numbers (330 mil x 0.32%) end one million dead. care? What’s point again? 

Everyone understands scope, friend. understand tragedies *worse* others. 150K preventable(!) deaths outraged? simply asking us take outrage level 10/10 9/10? Maybe wait till get 1 million deaths acknowledging tragedy **true** failure government healthcare system? 

Now could said something along lines “comparing WW2 pandemic problematic widely different causes outcomes” instead chose stupid argument shows everybody else understand count, value human life. Racism frowned upon evidence culture isn’t stupid. Ouch :-( need PSA's- need conservative leaders (in US elsewhere) role model wearing send clear messages effective. defending fucking age based genocide?

Like fuck wrong honestly? Even Infection Fatality Rate India 0.1% 1 million people die. ""Don't care health?"" mask-clad Patrizia Antonini asked people United States 

America worst Healthcare developed world. worst leave benefits occupations, arguably worst concerning rights comes health (physical mental). developed world provides adequate Healthcare, yearly increases minimum wage, adequate parental sick leave well vacation time - United States done absolutely nothing sort - Americans act like perfectly acceptable. 

Americans smart enough recognize entire society *not* favor personal health - would care themselves? think it'll end september/early october there's spike deaths, ramp deaths noticeable early september. 

Kids spread cases adults first. stop calling half truths are. What’s like ground? locals boarding inside enough food last weeks? consider many Americans concretely completely believe imaginary man sky created everything, reason literally everything lives happening way does, grand score keeper/referee everything, despite overwhelming evidence shit happening, Americans base entire moral, supernatural, ethical codes (and overall world view), set ideas (from 2000 years ago), really surprise many people believe do.

Its denial reality willful interpretation world around fit needs handle.

I dont want anyone get sick, want tangible effects virus expose people truth cannot deny, thats even possible.

I used get frustrated point stupid people are, want everyone safe, im tired fear contempt. music festivals would ok right? also fine football games outside stadium venues long people wear masks? Russian angle overplayed may even detract reality. People never needed Russians believe kinds conspiracies stupidities. Alex Jones spewing hate-filled conspiracies millions people decades even hint Russian meddling US elections. Americans never needed Russians think evolution hoax, believe anti-vaccine conspiracies. toxic political culture already there. Russians did, most, help along margins. lot schools starting 24th boat dock provision. guess we'll see schools decide cancel go online depending earlier starting schools affected You’re assuming public restroom running water &amp; soap, lol feels like I'm wearing **nothing all** *nothing all* *nothing all* Lots countries junk news. isn’t exceptional. 2 million without one million optimal timing interventions differs suppression mitigation strategies, well

... they’re ones charge 😣 Yes, take history class.

Yet still take offense fact US casualties represent small drop bucket total lives lost angry, calling bullshit.

Which one again? ""bullshit"" putting numbers perspective? like posted article detailing dismissiveness French regards Eastern Front, go single Americans. almost like there's ignorance everywhere, focusing one nation.

Did even read article? quite obviously watch video first comment, considering 18 minutes long replied 3 minutes posting it.

I'm also ""singling out"" anything, I'm merely pointing there's whole lot revisioning going contributions nations people ending WWII, actually dismissive actively perpetuated obviously dismissive. particular thread US action WWII. Someone said US get 1943, patently wrong. decided call Americans died battles ""only drop bucket"".

I decided truth, US casulties theaters drop massive bucket loss lives WWII represented, I'm sorry take offense wording offense always taken, never can't see that's dismissive, can't help you.

Did say anywhere died vain? say ""Haha look sucked""? give context, something apparently consider ""dismissive"", factual truth point staggeringly **massive** loss life WWII was.

I'm gonna reply anymore, go find somebody else angry at. You’re downvoted brain-drain FB spills Reddit.

Check /r/covid19 actual science. seem delusional mindset disease doesn’t exist world new illnesses never kill anyone. it’s society something wrong? It’s nature. power propaganda. look religions billions adults believing ridiculous fairytales—and willing die them. Idk that, american im constantly watching people refuse believe science. information, choose listen to. Thats like 5yo tell arsenic good you, scientist saying deadly. choosong listen 5yo. American tell us citizens perfect. 

Because we're stupid? part problem trying make us look like terrible people. 

You need people ""trying"" make look terrible. already laughing stock world. without mask? tiny violin guys probably deal lot dual citizens Ireland. surprising. doesn’t matter think Japanese people government inconsistent counterproductive. misguided are, growing frustrations express pattern government. Inconsistent counterproductive.

You want citizens stupid shit? transparent alleviate pain points. talking about? Children practically almost certainly virtually immune virus minuscule fraction fraction one percent spread it! a,beautiful thing are!! /s people getting reinfected, doesn’t mean “herd immunity” less impossible? made political. expected 300,000 deaths December. That's Population entire city (St. Louis), yet see few, masks go out. 
I know happen stop this, I'm afraid will. Here's latest case/death charts Gulf Shores (Baldwin graphs look promising. However they're 11.48 deaths per 100k population (US Average 48.53), probably easy lot folks pretend around. Biden republican look like. Yep. end result schools end closing moving strictly online.

And getting spreading virus U.S. Fall reach....especially south....the northeast, midwest, mountain west much better positions. realize already accounted right?  assumed control, assumed control...
As Canadian approve timeline, could bring back Neil world would better place. Yeah :(. I’m PBC, trust get it. 2010, Portland strip clubs per capita recall correctly. strangest fact learned visit. scary article. Every country that, denominator rather large.

What's thanks flawed electoral system people wield outsized influence. many, almost every single one program. College sports subsidize education. Maybe time lose. start losing president ""yours"" :D whole plan country reach maximum crisis November. Reduce public vote person, sabotage mail option voila, win election. cover mouth cough think conspiracy government control think yourself, let herd you.

No, think yourself. let nutter mouth-breathers you. Seriously, dipshits subreddit acting like I’m praising Americans shit ignore them. They're allies moment. second forget distance trump play innocent try win future.

The last 45 years GOP torn country apart.

I share videos. see offer political position. different masks. wear mask protects me. take vaccine protects me. Even numbers can’t used. American deaths WW2 men 20s coronavirus deaths people 75+ years old. million measures. College football subsidizes education. Schools even worse this.

Maybe facing significant enrollment shortfalls means significant financial shortfalls. question viruses last week, whether behavior today contributing problems future. 

If one-fifth population avoiding social distancing, etc., that's enough fuel another surge.

Your neighbors probably locking point, would wise join them. Would say statistical risk lower given risk higher due living situation change? Comparing behaviors different areas numbers, definetely statistically lower. go place lower numbers higher risk behaviors others living space? That's calculation I'm trouble figuring out. Also, population density 800/sq mile Ottawa, whereas 1000-1500/sq mile US counties place stay. 15 new cases per day Ottawa vs 80-150 US counties.  Maybe thats issue, lets columbus name them. dont want call us americans? Tough shit. We're american (not believe that, tactic lol)

Lets start taking photos flags masks quotes like ""real patriots protect eachother!"" ""Real americans afraid stay home!""

Ooooh this: take photo american flag. mask on, gun, saying ""real americans arent afraid government taking over, real americans protect eachother themselves""  Coronavirus officially end second Sunday first full moon third high tide following next leap day. realize 4x10=40, right? Ain't great leadership failure administration forcing many lose lose decisions?

Teachers school employees choose risking lives families lives continuing job love.

Parents get decide risking lives families lives sending kids virus germ factory school somehow find way keep jobs kids home.

Small businesses (like mine... shut down) get decide risking lives families lives workers' customers' lives open close doors, often times good. (Like mine.)

I going go many examples like college sports pro sports etc etc etc damn depressing.... right people understand.

We open economy without safeguards, go back full strength, 50-70% economy years recipe collapse.

Or could sit tight, test/trace/isolate, 6-8 weeks.

It's really disappointing see dumb/malignant many fellow citizens are. School NY half in-person half virtual others going full virtual. It’s idiotic conservative colleges already defying Cuomo going blown full in-person classes. literally disagreeing one world's best experts topic simply like says.

Funny, every thread Fauci people downright worshipping comments, drinking every word, says something people want hear, suddenly know he's talking anymore? valid concerns accelerated testing, expect everybody board day 1. think encourage discussion put genuinely concerned ease.

However, going turn quivering pile goo or, know, give COVID, going reasonably safe almost entire population. politicians put health nation ahead ridiculous politics many willing die need emulate anyone.

You managed cultivate image basis reality soon step outside safe space called it. Deservedly so. blood sign houses are, see blood, pass you. destructive plague touch strike



What plagues secret code mask?


There story boat helicopter trying rescue guy flood. guy insists God save him. drowns God tells sent boat helicopter..  think extreme, also wear mask outdoors times cause people may left virus air before. house ? Nope basics:

To Evictions: eviction moratorium new rental $, asks HUD ""consider"" evictions Unemployment: Uses $44B FEMA cover $300/week benefit ~5 Taxes: Option defer payroll tax payment, w/o new law they'll still know signed going route March? Everyone knew going stay like mid 2021 there's vaccine widely available. Except Australia pretty ok Facebook feed representation America way  No. It’s good sign.

We careful, also understand risk definitely isn’t high thought March. say understood risk hasn’t changed you’re downright lying yourself. 

Eventually go back virus there. slowly adjusting live meet middle extremes recommended politicians, nothing all. It’s good thing. That's good point obesity. wonder Fauci Slaoui considered personal estimates. 

I guess we'll wait find out. Meanwhile, good luck back you! people actively enjoy watching world burn would great news. link research?  

You’ll pardon don’t take word it. I’ve never seen conclusive outdoor controlled study related this. we’ve successfully established aerosolized less two months, would amazingly fast work.  concern notion basically equivalent “kids don’t get this” wisdom circulated months non-controlled meta-studies published instead hard research backing it. 

Everything know aerosolized viruses tell us reliably transmitted outdoors (the biggest initial spread America’s “Spanish flu” parade.)  masking way sure you’re spreading it. feel way. want move family us im sure go. mandate effect since June 28 enforceable since July 3. Since then, there's plenty people walking Broadway drink mask. They're jobs they're enforcing law certain people everyone. arresting violators arrest would problem. big deal. me, am, reading comment like. Yes, yep, yeah, damn, go that. personal tick drives pedantry far much. - June 17th even recent US. Average age death US 75-84 years old. 

Therefore average death COVID 80. yes correct, sub full delusional August 8th, could find individual state data age even supports argument. Average age death 75-79 Uh, no. True Chy-nah-Virus calling dumb. blames China death saying Chy-nah-Virus, could start world war  also thinking around informantion security goes. Hard demonstrate ROI. Oh, still Communist. Capitalism this, fact capitalist system reason vaccine found quickly. 

What's done corruption. Capitalism free markets truly powerful economic force corruption regulation created crony capitalism people believe fix wholesale switch social systems. 

We honestly need government backbone operate see incredible economy is. people covid yet yet know anyone who'd it. imagine plenty people felt scared got sick feeling lot scared now. witnessed someone close get really bad, die.

It's one things people viscerally afraid happens them. #It’s Da Todd Pawade! preschool 8th grade Catholic school...we could wear whatever shoes though feel like, depending state, people forced care pandemic risk livelihood. I’d love safe home risk life every day work don’t, can’t pay bills there’s way make enough money. feel like case many places.  attitude! also cultural difference USA Sweden. People likely respectful fellow humans; wear masks, wash hands, social distance. USA people outraged notion “impedes freedoms”. That's true. also removed no-pay first sick day instantly pandemic, get paid leave day 1 feeling 100%. One worst things pandemic strongly that, me, confirmed lot us Americans selfish, willfully ignorant, wasteful, spoiled, corrupt stereotypes always said were. always knew America blood hands like every Empire, still ashamed parts history.

But I've never ashamed American. pandemic making feel ashamed. Ashamed government's response. Ashamed many peoples reactions. Ashamed corrupt materialistic greedy culture is. 

Maybe none new blind it, many countries pulled together coronavirus, torn apart wearing masks, whether modern science trusted, tolerate officers kneeling necks impunity unmarked riot soldiers throw protestors unmarked cars. makes sick. understand debilitating fatigue is? Also happens many people. Others experience permanent lung heart damage neurological symptoms.

Also, ya know, death. wonder many residents voted governor. Yeah, countries knew January. jumped contained it. denial resulting delays created mess US. I'm sure county level data wondering besides I've already provided (new cases per day, population, population density). let know metrics want know, see get info.  Tell Europe test many people per capita US, we'll talk. That's way early, sick people keep dying even vaccine drugs out, forget happens flu, people still dying cause read loud partner. We're going hell. 😂 Sweden also way way wayyyyy worse rest Scandinavia comes COVID deaths, recommend taking approach matter lol seems piece EVERYONE thinking realizing. They’re focused fatality rate Yes, Americans actually value human life fact care.
I one them. However way Americans seem want millions people get sick die, can't want want. literally adult babies nothing more.

The fact hit 5 million cases boat astonishes disgusts time. ""President"" know unwilling what's right said before, citizens care all. even depressing fact people actually following guidelines getting virus anti-mask tumbleweeds.

Now sending CHILDREN back school middle this. CHILDREN catching disease via fault own.

These reasons call US ""United States"" anymore. Reason United all.

This rant. source someone talking approving vivid vaccine clinical trials done, need post it. provided evidence point yet. I'm glad Americans come right say appreciate concern citizens visitors. welcome back time. Which, itself, caused migration European countries. Many came seeking cheap land, well lack religious persecution. say, Mormons living Utah. Education?

Not way watch! Sweden 56.6 deaths per 100k pop, USA close behind 49.65. reckon catch bit though, unless Sweden experiences second wave. Netherlands lockdowns better 35.85.   react ? Russian meme end? Russians made stupid 😭😭😭 wonder what's contagious:

a. Coronavirus

b. Trump's stupidity

c. plain ignorance

&amp;#x200B;

One fixed eventually, two stay. Well nothing new. Read behaved 12th century. House passed stuff months ago. Senate can't get act together. Maybe we’ll get lucky Darwinism take effect. Nothing would fitting piece shit principle dying Covid. planning moving EU got really interested Germany hearing really like American students essentially get masters free learn language prove arent financial boon arrival. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure school option you, that's gameplan. actually announced last week 5-year clock EU started. graduated, god-willing FT work hold feeling like might bust-ass make happen next 3 years, good luck! Entitlement masses real desiese Add normalized _story_ coronavirus become. Numbers, milestones, reports, testing - don’t evoke visceral response. one close brought home wheezing, shaking, sight tubes nose, grief saying goodbye mom dad Zoom nurse’s shaky phone, still another story. that’s denial thrives - especially you’re stressed-out, underpaid, overexhausted, average middle-class American.

I really despise denialism, doesn’t fucking _do_ anything problem hand - maybe hate conditions allow flourish more. get it’s appealing, wish fucking weren’t. That's pitfall relying protest get anything done. Facebook group post county live Alabama. Wish us luck:



Mask On, Mask :
In OPINION ...wearing mask long put risk getting respiratory infection. healthy breath air. Yes try wear one store step back away people pull mask get fresh air. also stay 6 feet distance. bet sweet ass comes soon leave store. remember taking home possibility items contaminated already many people touching products bought.? think wearing mask useless!!!! believe staying 6 feet apart using hand sanitizer good idea. far mask........not. everyone mask wearing it. ? put one back go another store!!!!...The one took off. heart go's wear 6/8 hours day more. reason wear mask appease people shut up. chose wear one not. wearing protected right?

My humble idea whole herd immunity idea utter bollocks, due coronaviridae immunity 12 month 24 tell. really felt guided wishful thinking mid march. fear kind wishful thinking dead. think Americans need come together, take accountability well, know lot finger pointing going stronger together, let’s stop divide. confident get thru nation. Let’s reload come back virus! Holy shit nuts put way? South Korea Germany approve it, take it. take Trump's administration. Pathetically, yes I've seen behavior. FYI legitimately interested people linking mask debate pedos, here's one logic train actually heard used:

Children socialized around ""good, normal people"", young age recognize ""safe"" body language, facial expressions key part this. everyone wears masks, going learn recognize obvious signs pedophile

Is actually good argument? No, course not. care? No, course not.

(And case needs explicitly stated, obvious reason argument sucks implies possible recognize pedophiles faces and/or children victims pedophiles pre-mask wearing insufficiently socialized around ""good"" faces) Still shows point.

Wow. &lt;4%? I'm California, San Diego, we're 10% He's technically right, disappear like 14th century Black Death: millions dead. Americans care (I think least). issue nation size continent. Many things happen big ways bulk nation never even seeing occur. Seeing personally part believing, especially era everything ""fake news"", matter what. America large enough anything hidden. simply large, various regions US close nothing common. Someone east cost would likely see someone west coast foreign someone another nation. Everything cultures, dialects, diet, history, intrests, goals, wants, etc. can't hold nation like together, amount diversity tear apart make care much, experiencing events. That's exact reason tornadoes deadly Bible belt. Elsewhere, people hear alert go shelter. strongly religious communities, people either believe food protect hits them, God's stay put. much winning since 2017 mean operate US army hardware...helicopters tanks etc. would consider military? 


Never forget video ripping town! droplets hit mask viruses stop there. flow freely withing room. 6 feet enough virus airborne. Numerous people including infamous Dr. Fauci stated Coronavirus airborne component. basically renders masks pretty much useless true true someone needs fire Dr. Fauci either biased, liar dementia setting in. nervous education superintendent smart one held proper level responsibility. Sadly Florida Georgia education superintendents held standard. 
School staff forced work unsafe condition. school emergency services. helps take seriously, unlike shitshow states. also government cares people, unlike states. Hate say it, Americans gradually conditioned tolerate &amp; offences rights &amp; national standards. Even conservative past Presidents, sort thing would never tolerated. may, one talking skipping clinical trials, approving anything without establishing safety. 

Your link may work you, takes home page. However, considering home page, I'm inclined take anything website seriously.

Also, would useful tool able approve drugs without establishing safety, somehow ""vaccine-wise"" safer wait trials? Americans believes ""Live free Die."" busy fighting Communist China. trade war them. kick embassy country. President convincing people wear masks, especially ones China. forcing kids going back school. busy kneeling black people. busy stopping Chinese apps keeping track people. Tiktok really threat country. Virus gonna wait deal things. can't use Chinese vaccine either, microchips them. wait vaccine come out. wait election make virus magically disappear.  USA probably 1st world nation half population actively fighting anything benefits country people. even basic things like wearing masks safety - half population actively fight literally seen largest spread hottest parts country middle summer. know anyone could say summer slows rofl. decedent age 78 years 

In US average death 78 years old (basically 80).
Keep using outdated sources argument though, thats cool

EDIT: LINK SAYS AVERAGE AGE GOT COVID 60% deaths disease among people aged 80 over

THATS WORLD

Why fucks keep making lies COVID? knew hated people watched video. Drunk college kids whose identity rooted cheap fucking vodka, ""bad ass bitches,"" yelling ""WOOOOOOOOOOO,"" caring anything else, unfortunately go away pandemic oh God they're worse. 

Thankfully, many grow this. Sadly them, video still exist. 

I hate drunk college kids, get wrong. 

Cheers drinking alone! Hm, sounds like schools Everything phrased anti-America focus America. Nobody cares rest countries fit America Bad Agenda. Welcome r/politics health departments across state thoroughly question infected people businesses they’ve visited, officials say, agencies lack money contact tracers needed perform extensive inquiry. also want limit amount time contact tracers take people interview, already reluctant share information private lives.

This contact tracing largely useless United States.

As practical matter, enough resources determine near circumstances.

If caught household member co-worker, probably trace success. circumstances, really possible, can't force anyone submit testing even suspect them.

The South Koreans problem. would track spending phone. would know find others close proximity tracking them, too. would quarantine lot you.

Americans really use contact tracing. Instead, Americans perform virus surveys trace occasional easy case others identify may infected.

Epidemiologists *are* telling don’t need mask situations. mean, it’s going hurt wear one. isn’t good mental health falsely believe everyone rides past bike without one potential infection. people always infatuation ""being scared"" ""fearful"" virus? fear, common sense taking precautions. feel need act ""brave"" shit? Newsflash idiots, virus. fucking animal that's going run away act tough. give fuck whether ""afraid"" it, infect regardless. Damn people stupid one lowest murder rates major city world increase looks dramatic. Wonder Sweden really low numbers?

Maybe try warring mask wouldn’t unstoppable. Education needs legislated national security issue; encompassing nefarious obstructuons, institutionalized capitalized, undone: crippling budgets, prioritizing giant publisher's agendas sane practices, media consolidation, citizens united, on. heck Unimed?! Autocorrect ... helpful 😂

Thanks pointing out, fixed it. agree you. earnest experts CDC get blindsided, seems happened repeatedly pandemic, agree best course action safest one. fabric pro freedom!! agree this, way people comply forever. would look like 50-60% vaccine efficacy rate? Would accept spread (maybe) deaths certain point? Worse case - immunity wanes?

That’s stuff scares right now. Agreed immediate concern emergency assistance people. Yeah, well entire world basically [closed there's that. us care entire world astonished. inconsiderate selfish idiots, would expect. Wish we’d first get shit together first, spending second Americans.

Because really think it, what’s worse:

Fucking first wave, getting things control fucking cause second wave sheer stupidity? least Americans never pretended smart enough handle this.   getting others ""breaking law brazen arrest came outcry allegations hordes **visitors flouting requirements** meeting large groups. let people government keep vaccine pop soon enough we'll easily faster think considering less 10% population got virus far already 33% WW2 deaths, corrected population. excuse then? mean, legal drinking age 21 quit?  care, yesterday drove lake Fremont . tell must’ve 500 people masks. mean groups people playing volleyball, throwing parties every park drove people throwing parties WEARING MASKS. shocking, people think COVID joke, said they’ll fine it’s “just flu” sad us social distancing throwing parties wearing masks disinfecting everything :/ astrology ouija board? justifiably skeptical

Your skepticism justified. understand subject, responsibility citizen defer experts. ESPECIALLY times crisis.

Our country falling apart unjustified skepticism yours. Either study subject professionally, defer. Spreading misinformation trying make others feel justified harmful thing do. considering low current rate is, likely NYC still lower infection rate places even schools open one. sorry say yeah true really stand-alone legislation emergency funding. watch Fox News. buy it. 160,000 people died, end sight. people understand severity situation, feel important thing ""Trump President"", they're willing put ahead literally everything else (even family's safety, definitely peoples' safety). Nah, 5% also, they're extra loud  doctor serving South Carolina’s state epidemiologist said regrets speaking publicly concerns state reopened close-contact businesses coronavirus pandemic.

Ohio, despite mask mandate, half customers best, (surprisingly) many employees places even bother. Sneeze guards up, sure seems like playing fire. Maybe I’m cautious, dunno. Ireland mandatory mask wearing transport retail locations. High mask social distancing compliance, pubs business still open, many us still working remotely. Schools open. Similar NI, Wales, Scotland, Italy, France, Germany that's seven countries wrong about. Want think right rest? reason writing familiar current situations. is!!!

Sorry, Canadian/British point view. Lol responding post uses number 450,000, confirmed cases infections, 420,000. mean actual infections. 3.3 million good estimation, still means 17% population entire NY state. article wards empty reached herd immunity...

He'd immunity possible year Weak leadership selfish priorities all.  let people keep vaccine pop soon enough we'll easily faster think considering less 10% got virus far already 33% WW2 deaths corrected population. excuse then? course 5 million cases. We’re worst, makes us best. Better world even! Ha  You’re right. never gotten much power. according popular vote, still shouldn’t. tbh, spouts fucking lies. informed American, infuriates me. FEA currently suing state emergency order. Hopefully courts put end this. Trump ""if can't get rid virus, we'll spread world""
Fu ck Mr President Compromise works ways. Republicans need go higher too. requires time

There’s data much, little, air conditions, wind direction, talking, sneezing, coughing etc vs breathing, breathing hard exercising etc.  

Covid insanely contagious. hard data epidemiologists tell to, wear mask. Walked Grandpa’s house day. One America News on, normal, playing videos sent people claiming sick cured hydroxichloriquin. OAN telling viewers send stories stories people know who’ve cured “miracle drug” make sure tell doctor that’s want treated get sick.

It’s fucking mad house here. think fake entire comment want believe. Summer slowed shit US. Maybe try provide sources claims next time bc data contradicts spewing. 
Support get involved local politics grassroots movements like http://reclaimtheamericandream.org/

It's slow grind, real change grassroots.  want though. 

The USA flag ingrained people's minds associated loudness, obesity, bigotry, narcissism. really think it, DT stereotypical American live today that's POTUS. Oh shoot. Thought did. “Because many willing burn house means you’ll get annoyed”... there, fixed ya. No. don’t. That's still minority. majority sooooooooooooooo many ignorant people. need o's. “What-about-ism” making killing.

Pun intended. people care exhausted keep trying convince people care.

Education real crisis here. Nope we’re dealing three epidemics right now, covid, stupidity, apathy. Quite lethal combo say Goodbye E Pluribus Unum. Hello “it is” one gave NPR one died? Propaganda hell drug. Nice try, no. cases right. Sometimes, bill needs passed badly quickly circumstances arisen really hurt entire country. 

So party writes bill deals issues, case, direct cash struggling, unemployed Americans, question important one. 

What good standoff?

And yet are, complaining Democrats. They've papers drawn occasion. instead complaining Republicans even giving vote, complaining Democrats fighting bill gives LESS bill Republicans wont vote for.

Dude, need stop voting interests, watch news FOX. really going open eyes. Well gosh dang it, tried this! doesn’t answer question all. 

What would experts done? ~86 days Sweet plot twist ahaha. didn’t ask, take picture him. dusk see blurred dark blob front backside volcano. stopped Cougar, WA gas beer bowling alley/public library/gas station. also went Ape Cave earlier day, complete adventure human history. still wipe groceries down, open packages outside bring contents inside.. definitely afraid social distancing lasting forever. Ugh. test people home rain, sure wet well significantly lower rate. people know won’t wear mask say, “it’ll go away elections over. They’re trying make Trump lose” yet completely ignore ask it’s also bad Europe places. Agreed. Stay safe! probably exactly want continue push private charter school agenda skeleton crew trying run public school system. lot us care, enough us fucked rest us.

Everything cases per population, flat numbers side. choice go work homeless. safety net. Couple months without health minister too. negligence through. RemindMe! 2 weeks Thats strange, Norway schools preschools open now, reopened infection rates significantly rise. specific precautions taken avoid infection-

At sons preschool parents allowed beyond gates. teacher came collect child specific allotted time avoid backup parents arrivingat once, hands disinfected, child went teacher. 

Playground sectioned zones, kids divided small groups 4 one teacher. So-so many groups allowed indoors one time, rest time spent outdoors. went lot walks!! longer provided food kindergarten, come packed lunches. kid even sniffles, stay home. toys equipment used disinfected multiple times day.

Ironically, kid never healthy. parents preschoolers know, they've usually got bug brewing every second week, kid without single cough sniffle since pandemic broke out!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  know getting voted. CDC definitely contributed whole masks work myth. remember doctors getting paraded less conservative networks FOX News talking particle size small masks effective. 

They could've honest said hey hoard masks, need doctors nurses. Actually, bet lot mouth breathers would wearing masks days CDC said hoard them. Patients mainly discharged. die. People think patients stay hospital forever. know went school burbs never heard shoe laces controlled baring shoulders though, that's need take hard line!!

Stop! can't clutch pearls harder. never ashamed American.

Give weeks. seem determined find bottom. smart tell you. smart. smarter virus like covid19. smart disappear. learned lot virus, stuff fascinate me, tell disappear fear smart are. Fake news, listen fake news virus works Politics shit either side pick

One side anti-science, racist, fascist leader side believes science, civil rights equal access voting. 

This “both sides same” trope never accurate never moreso now. mean ... sure, agree you, personally. 

I also know that's really true people's interpretations, value assessments, motivations, perceptions different. easy assessment: wrong science care things. them, making choices best based things. elected leader make one, true leaders hard find propped fantastic examples far wide. risk us scared losing homes careers. like driving car highway. know might kill still drive. Well least everyone get move on. That's America wants anyway, guess. Indeed. hate say it, surest way keep schools open leave question whether close schools people run school systems.

Eventually people ask whether local teachers needed, whether remote learning can’t outsourced cheaper, etc, etc.

So make sure open help subordinates. sides, that's' politics taught majority world, nothing division.  political...This HUMAN thing, understand 100% world can't follow party line, smh. Wow. wow. show that??? SCTV?? Es lo que es Yea. Based pictures it’ll schoolwide couple weeks. Couple things:

1. Good. Lets keep way reopening schools.

2. Death rate whole story, it’s certainly statistic people look (incidence vs. precedence vs. morbidity vs. mortality, highlight mortality alone). general, take account effect precedence young people aforementioned stats old people.  Say amen share confirm several individuals knowingly infected virus attending Sturgis rally despite diagnosis. One individual week long pass Buffalo Chip bar. individual undoubtedly going super streader. believe said “ought to”. followed based premise. understand it’s not, be, it’s damn money. country seems like consistently ran wealthy, old, senile far removed american people struggles idea reality is. 1.2 million people die tuberculosis every year that’s sudden important. According brother brother law anyway one That's good question. Red Sox fan sending good wishes speedy recovery! 😕 Guess enough booster shot then. 25+ children deaths july? impression virus relatively less dangerous younger ages. unanimous authoritative control put stop virus.... looks like get much much worse been. schools opening place regardless mean. crazy amount testing would yield results show significant number New Zealaders currently Covid-19. Let's act like grocery stores excess, pointless snacks. local Kroger chain sells everything small autoparts, medicine, local natural food, etc. closed long period time means millions would without meds food. exceptionally valuable every day people. 

Also none stores live near actually hired would usually have, flat make workers work shit pay protections.

Why pay people work run new hire insane demand either burn agree. violence stepped up, wasn’t sad couldn’t keep up. 

He sad one would pay since left bodies street. 

“When gets bad, don’t even bother coffins” line believe Think economy! Everyone knows thats important thing world. Tetsuo!!! wait days get shorter weather colder people become vitamin deficient. 2749 number look good. yet statistics nationwide US 200 deaths due covid persons age 18. represents 1% deaths age group time. despise hypocrisy, mock vigorously, throw pros good measure. CDC’s current best estimate infection fatality rate 0.65%. big red button opens trap door student. Lmao. Yeah Real option stagger classes don’t mix. doesn’t work US high schools function.

If let kids mix like go hallway instead taking 1 class time socially distanced manner (1-2m) apart,

Then 9 could 2 3. It’s still gonna keep everyone safe anything it’s going slowdown speed infection.  sure downvoted. Rushing vaccines creating drastic demand proven dangerous Cutter incident anything go by. Yeah, That’s exactly hell I’m saying. haven’t given opportunity super spread like good at. going go get grubby kids send virus stratosphere. It’s gonna blood bath. kids haven’t public building since February I’ve pulled daughter school first quarter re-evaluate second. Chill, agreement here. Kudos resigning even though financially devastating. right thing. Omg quotes gonna give aneurysm Pretty sure isn’t allowed due interstate commerce laws. Basically states can’t enact laws rules dealing business states. even NYC’s worst days cities couldn’t refuse allow flights passengers JFK LaGuardia. San Antonio pretty bad spread. Great news indeed. long paperwork order guys fine. cross german border weekly basis, problems.

Just remember masks public indoor areas kill ;-) Truancy works well cuts middleman. country I've seen Facebook group parents sharing tips get kids school without masks (which mandatory pupils 11 sit within 3 ft other). Fake medical certificates, demonstrations school board, etc... I’m sure it’s legal disclaimer. traditional way minimize Covid simply call pneumonia


Pneumonia disease. literally shorthand term symptoms internal organ collapse lungs brought *either* bacterial viral attack, well aftereffects. like saying people dying bleeding, ignoring gun fired bullet killed them. Im antivaxxer means gen 1 vaccines tend problematic. Makes nervous tbh wanting wait gen 2 see happens pioneers going day 1. Us already past 5 million Even though 89, cares longterm value investments, 10-20 years now. doubt bothers Life land bright. Starting?  17 deaths 25M people. equivalent USA is... 200 deaths. I’m looking info. give head start places look it? mildly surprised James Murdoch explicitly named politics left Murdoch Empire

Welp You’re wrong, it’s also definitely true Russia *is* attempting interfere negatively US politics, least *some* degree success. That’s thing wrong America it’s least partially fault allowing reach point, something bad that’s happening right now. ultimate solution needs fixing processes, meantime respond specifically temporary measure then. Think second. piece cloth. I'm coughing it, blocks virus right? fuck wouldnt side? us stuck parents boomers they're 60 55, respectively. Never mind, lol.  hopeless Equally, one argue, excess evidence accurate count. rest course conjecture.

However, you’re open idea causes contributed excess, would hypocritical also consider degree undercounting also highly likely. Especially, many recorded issues testing. Distribution, accuracy, slow turn around, etc.

Re: opiate example, make delta closer 70%. feel it’s likely opiate numbers 70%, covid numbers 30%? Covid undercounting proportionately likely. competent government leaders said school kids don’t get COVID. Must fake news. Whenever covid test slide long thing nose, shove microchip back nose mission installing tracking devices already accomplished.

*big brain* Putting end civil discussion. Excellent work. /s Home diagnostic test approvals US exceptionally rare. Generally basis concerns test results incorrect incorrectly interpreted. Damn thought British scrapping grain sand sunbathe bad. Deaths way even 85 plus Yea mean could work zoom meetings day sarcasm Americans think? both? stole He's quoting covid deniers Im sorry struggle this. Stay strong! commend never listened word Trump said. agree way everything run UK either least schools go back primary age kids least class bubbles. get case need send group home while. 

The teachers even mix lunch time outside year group wife's school. Hard tell take seriously though.

Secondary schools looked much think meant year group, though harder teachers specialised certain subjects. 

They can't even close everyone kids come contact high school everyone mixed. staggered class swaps break times, assume.  Yeah, Ontario released app seems pretty useless. order notify near someone who's tested positive, need within two meters person fifteen minutes more, *and* person must also using app. many constraints helpful. Tell basic understanding science science unknown, simultaneously pretending understanding science literally claimed unknown.

Or keep feadmongering ""what ifs"" make disease turn fatal wanted still seem severe need be. Sold. even think?? flu killed 4 times kids even vaccine. us point?? fucking moron. normal mask protect inhaling virus limits way spread breathing/coughing/sneezing.

People wearing masks fucking themselves, fucking everyone else. Mask wearing surge affected Melbourne mandatory week. appears noticeable change restrictions start downwards trend September. Elimination think achievable goal. We're last. means we're first.  Well, stop testing cases would obviously down. Come guys! many ""told ya so""s people need? Fuck's sake. Brutal. dig it. Let 'em get Rona take homes, churches, tattoo parlors. Fuck lot them. would know difference preferably hold back using word hate.

And also would use words like unite love, words like hate (divide conquer). 

I think better, less emotional comment would something long lines of... ""I hate way country become politically, I'm ready make change. Including, whatever takes ensure change takes place uniting beautiful country"" (alot natural beauty here). Russians pushing shady vaccine trials sounds like start zombie virus subsequent apocalypse - I’ve seen enough movies, buckle shit hits fan survive initial outbreak start foraging supplies.

that 9. Wait, what? I’m FL haven’t left home since March. read last night 60-ish free ICU beds county population 974k (seems updated daily). It’s even winter yet it’s bad people still going road trips, weddings eating inside despite proven aerosol. I’ve slowly stocking food supplies waiting second wave first hasn’t even ended yet. lack common sense self preservation dumbfounding. Ironically short sighted see we're going lose money long run hundreds thousands people die *and* still spends billions caring survive left long term medical problems. ONE singular thing place work done right is: experiencing symptoms exposed, stay home get tested. symptoms warrant sick time, pay without using it, don't, work home.

It's honestly thing county done right, great 4k employees. $3 basically free, make difference consumer huge difference manufacturer. Remember, money made vaccine  U mean black tidal wave 97,000 kids going crash 450,000 teachers 55 y/o. need know yourself...

To know must let go ego...

When let go ego thing bothering weed might fact smoke it..which isnt best thing lungs...

Other side effect forgetfulness... dont forget forget irrelevant things... AKA weed=priority setter Although. technically correct, death count isn’t meaningful way measure loss life. Distrust sows distrust. People dumb, know this, high standards put people leaders? originally, thought still hope.... light end tunnel...

unfortunately, see anymore.  ""anti-maskers"" used people supported certain political party certain politician(you-know-who)... lately, I've noticed anti-maskers political distinction. could supporters political parties.  What's worse, young people(20 30) increasingly ignoring masks, social distance, hand-cleaning, etc...  mention LOT openly ignoring travel-related quarantine requirements many cities states. 

Like said, think there's hope left. virus run course unhindered.  end alright, probably 2025? Please...have imagination stop apologizing atrocious handling whole situation. Thanks! improvement.  Well, Boris go teach kids day wants. guess ever heard jokes. 🕵️‍♀️ know wont. 

All measures business taken wont place, like plexiglas barriers everywhere, social distance everywhere, masks, etc. Hallways still crowded spittles flying everywhere.  Viruses generally mutate become infectious less lethal would arguably kind good thing. Everyone's personality gets altered way external circumstances face life. going altered regardless. get altered school, ways better, ways worse, although hopefully net positive.

Then doesnt.. brains tricky don’t get you. Nursing homes cesspools germs put one covid patient people nursing home get it. That’s don’t put begin with. dense double dipping mother fucker

(Actually sounds super duper shitty) Know yourself!:) 1. highly abnormal. world, including United States, gone back normal life back normal months now.

2. completely ignore studies studied, clearly haven’t read them. Taking 5 minutes actually become informed you’re opining instead wasting 5 minutes typing completely made feelings something know nothing usually better way spend time. mean, psychic powers aren’t real. don’t draw information studies clearly haven’t read like spiritual aether. No... don’t get it. 

What people showed hospital sent home self quarantine. 

They got diagnosis. worse come back. Else fine home. 

But nursing homes what? medical facilities. retirement homes. medically based. nurses 

You’re dense? heard him. bro Pokey people want fuck with. isnt literal fact. scientific proof that. getting education later. gotten tested twice times got back 2 days. tines negative thankfully. live NJ. think Georgia getting delayed? Anyone 40 would fight front que. Anyone 30 meh ever. common use word, yes. MIS-C proper treatment usually results child entirely recovering.

In tiny percentage MIS-C patients coronary symptoms last longer require follow up.

Earlier diagnosis treatment results better outcomes. problem lies situation. Parents taking children would otherwise routine pediatrician visit waiting longer MIS-C treated. healthier people are, less problems get get infected. 
This vitus kill everyone gets infected. 

So lowering infection rate minimize risk infected get seriously sick dies virus. 0-14 days now, average 4-5 days. takes 5–6 days symptoms show, reporting usually one-week delay. school opened 5 days earlier. thus likely 9 people *already it*, spreading tight corridors 2,500 people. TRUMP'S REVENGE TIK TOK INCIDENT model also assumes states reissue stay-at-home orders close non-essential businesses daily death rate state reaches 8 per million.

This model assumes smart. *just* reopened schools. We're fucked. Yup Can't wait access Ragccine export US though. school nuts regarding dress code, could dye hair, boys tuck shirt wear belt, long hair allow school cut hair, even threatened parents DCS comply. do. It’s exhausting would love (am seriously considering buying UV-C lamps). Although risk may indeed low (how low??), really don’t feel comfortable taking chances. Maybe it’s definetively confirmed low risk nobody gets infected route another 3 months now, I’ll think relaxing bit.

Plus, feel it’s something regardless covid. Supermarket/grocery store storage rooms, shipping containers warehouses real filthy places. worker shortages, additional stress, protocols all, hygiene may be, ironically, even less adequate. There’s tons potential pathogens could end packages say rats/mice, roaches crawl pee/poop them. think it’s good hygiene practice, don’t want end getting sick either way. Lots employees caught virus. way tell many stupid tourist returned home sick afterwards. lets say hypothetically sake argument big mommy milker mommy major udder big mommy extra milky milkers 200cm milkies milkers full whole breast milk mommy pegged bad dragon 13 inch horse dildo full balls extra grip included cum tube shoot hot cum extra cum 62% cum semen serum extra warm combined milky mommy heated stove Making even funnier, Illinois making brown blk children going back school priority white children.

Lmao salty. Hard blame country best healthcare view? Also, see post made earlier, actually uses Prof. Gustafsson recent criticism towards current policies, post actually elderly care, one widely off-topic, trying white-wash anything. valid concerns criticism. Sounds low.  


There lot brain dead Americans. masks, social distancing, still ""hoax."" 


I would see long term numbers closer 1 - 2% population. Mirroring Spanish Flu. would stop that? Numbers already under-reported. 1/3 take vaccine. Way many type events summer. quoting studies terminal care, people established life-ending disease. Covid clearly kind disease.

So compare apples oranges. point opening shops &amp; pubs. opening schools closing shops/pubs. Seems like deliberately giving many people possible chance catch covid19. lad army medics could help fucked states, others put paid leave take care families, might help. Less money spent oil ammo. might actually help Americans pull Nigel Farage Brexit move. That's due competency, opening schools.

That's like wearing diaper shitting saying ""see babies!""

Good luck that. Sshh.. Trump realizes hurricane kill people, declare hurricane fake news  parent doesn’t work expect feed shelter family? Cars kill 👍 let’s ban cars Always protests discussed nothing else. nuts. tons places mass crowds gather nothing mentioned. Political bias obvious comments. politicizing pandemic beyond me. Getting sick dying like badge honor. Insanity. thing wife says. Quality super high, worth 3x price. hightlights ridiculousness opening schools areas still pushing social distancing. know anything high school know number students always herded hallways every hour time always going make social distancing impossible. Even schools decided go half students time half online still way social distancing change classes. possible. 

Of course would also like see lunch rooms. place social distancing possible yet administrators ignore reality pretend keep everyone social distancing. It’s people believe vaccines. proportion antivaxxers tiny wouldn’t result 1/3.

I think every vaccine that’s available NHS, I’m waiting one like 2/3 years. still shorter vaccines taken get market.

An older survey suggesting 50% wild actually take vaccine. I'm shocked 9. give anti-maskers vaccines? It’s short sighted all. Wall Street Main Street two different things. Rich people care money peasants lives. Last checked stock market well. like investors happy happens. Leverage stock recovery going up. better ever. or, everyone seen coming easily spread disease already infecting 5 million US alone, can't make kids wear masks day, think pretty obvious would happen fair, schools done great job looking like another capitalist arm. Six figure student debt, text books, begging donations alumni.

Thank reading right? 338,000 children confirmed COVID since pandemic began. 97,000 within last two weeks July? alone frightening. school starts, notably people started getting much relaxed nationwide socializing. Seems pretty predictive happen mid-September entire nation back classroom. Well, that's certainly unexpected. Yea I’m cop went stabbing got forgot mask (my damn fault) suspect COVID positive. minute long exposure guy. 

Entirely fault although I’ve big proponent wearing mask day one. Mask compliance pretty high tell suspect wearing one. thought Obama whole response team book drawn explaining handle situation. Trump 100% try spin way, yes. send kids camp? understand leave home alone. 60 patients. large enough sample size, participants study severe cases, virtue hospitalized.

Youre totally virgin. 

I totally touched nerve, nerd. free dramatic. Guess daycare workers dead months. Bernie Sanders threatening make pay everyone's basic healthcare entirety 2021. solution far cheaper him. cautious. know must miss her. beg you, Herman, wear mask. Thoughts Daddy Trump needs economy. I’m young healthy, would gladly take $500 human challenge. literally thousands people would. LIBERTY PRIME suspend whoever reported cases. I’m bit wary vaccine clearly pushed quickly made cheaply. bad vaccines made like past. Philippines Dengue Fever vaccine, Cutter Incident, RSV vaccine, etc. I’m obviously worried vaccines heavily quality controlled, history efficacy, situations rife chances failure. problem way we’ll know use large enough quantity know it’s safe. Sad say politics based decision wrong basis. asked earlier. Ok, let's establish baseline... read travel advisory? look full list 100+ travel advisories issued 8/6? Actually, said he'd give unemployed $300 week asked states pitch extra $100 week. programmed masses actually thinking rights!?  idiocy.  think are, questioning state mandates scary, scary time?  Rules rules, people! one thing fight disease HERD MENTALITY idiots jeopardizing that.

IMO, state ALWAYS right especially backed media barrage.  idiots believe support everything told fact filled media reports totally benevolent executive orders? I'm speechless... mean, get it.

My blind trust loving government never led astray... anti maskers questioning emotional investments i've made trying time?  goddam pandemic, ffs! 

What bunch selfish buffoons. They'll get what's coming them. Cheaper paying tax Bernie Sanders demands pay instead.  Even daily tests, safe. Tests reliably show positives least days exposure (about 5 days), infected start spreading disease early 36-48 hours.

Not mention, testing resources aren’t even available states (including Georgia) test asymptomatic people don’t known exposure. told exGF mega dramatic “hE HiTLeR 2.0” results good 2020, wouldn’t see reason vote him. value results methods. 

It’s extremely clear results laughable right took pandemic confirm it. I’m superstitious, little stitious. Atwater 100 miles me. hurts. Legitimately, crazy amount testing. Like CDC, Dr Fauci Pediatricians Association, believe schools mostly open. Schools serve education needs, public health well. Closed schools cost lives, don’t save them. 

Kids don’t cease exist schools closed. go busy daycares, pile informal daycare unsafe conditions, go elderly grandma’s house. Open schools, except worst hot spots everything needs locked down, save lives. I've seeing comment lately, someone say USA fewer cases world? Got link? I'm curious. ""High plateau"" means different things depending national standards are...  know Gaslight Obstruct Project way literally anything, even sacrificing 150k+ American's realize might good options.

There are, problem idiot chief polarized issue two binary choices, like everything does.

Go remote, start making exceptions needed/possible. entirely possible many kids remote possible, need it, make in-person (but distance-learning content peers) available.

But nope. ""OPEN SCHOOLS"" says President Chaos Twitter. so, are. question kind crazy insurer would agree insure school. That’s kinda stupid thing report news people already knew borderline idiots fully insufferable ejected. ones band together stupidity dying mass numbers. Unfortunately, stupid makes people contagious. Otherwise would ideal situation Given lack coronavirus strategy, apparently expect die needlessly need money. Yeah, it’s insane fast it’s spreading Poor baby! Well, senate could impeached him... good constitution checks balances don’t plan enforce them?

I’d say US democracy already deeply broken moment living 21st century aristocracy. students, teachers relatives.

It tens thousands here. think rely workers paying today provide funds go retirees today. Yeah bars/parties shit going hard Donald Trump’s voice “It is” Dude. OK argument makes sense undertand history reddit. Yeah man dark. literally free started. weird censor things cause point censor. There's jailbaits replacement fauxbait wanna head there. Reddit liberal rainbow sunshine shit there's slight silver lining maybe less people die infectious diseases due increased precautions? Eh...its something.... Serious question. many children US K-12 system? Oh hey thanks letting know! Phew! feel relieved now. Lol problem several meta analyses decades data flu vaccine show there’s little evidence suggest flu vaccine appreciably reduces hospitalizations influenza flu-like disease even effective years. So... probably won’t much way reducing burden health system

 friend texted say government constitutionally banned lockdown reason. Seems like bizarre thing put constitution anyone could explain why?

It’s actually crazy they’ve done well far considering government hasn’t really done whole lot. I’m trying detract point, would like point sustainable living situation housing cost 1/3rd income know gets that. data provided 3.2% confirmed cases fatal, yet somehow 0.13% require hospitalization. Seems like incredibly optimistic reading statistics. Lmfao uhhhh

Don’t know you’re aware this, official name covid is....

**S**evere **A**cute **R**espiratory **S**yndrome **Co**rona **V**irus **2**

or

**SARS**-CoV-2

🤷🏻‍♀️ reading article (haven’t signed NY Times), that’d guess: “novel” (eg: new) virus; plus, G-strain CoV contagious flu?   I've seen done. I've personally fine kid walking home school. fine unsupervised recess (newsflash: kids unsupervised). fine traveling internationally kid. fine microwaving food kid. fine got hours parents played morning unsupervised.

My parents fine grew farm unsupervised.

There's ""technical issues"" go wrong kid proof home make sure kid knows safe safe. plenty entertainment food, problem.

The idea kids can't home alone hilarious ignoring historical reality. age kids, course able home alone. depends maturity level kid, something taught kids. Agreed. fact several home test already production (by legitimate companies) whatever reason FDA approve them.

The amount corruption gross. Video goes viral, students. Also, still data lingering affects and/or long-term impact organs.

We enough information make informed decisions want lab rat. assure historically cancer killed way people epidemics World Wars combined.

Lockdowns used last resort, never said action taken, lockdowns like killing bear nuke. many alcoholics agree list. need go bar drink :) Speaking friend. honestly might wearing masks US years

I'd say years stretch. Even went vaccine available years still necessarily mean masks required long. things like instant testing drugs either treat infection and/or reduce ability spread could reduce need masks. haven’t flu since high school (so almost 20 years ago) I’m elementary teacher somehow dodged every year. I’ve always scared get shot since it’s long since it’s body, guess year it. Also, planning stepping foot classroom need take every precaution anyway. He’s scientist, motivational speaker. is. Sure tell pugs. show signs inbreeding. Viruses not. Same. I’m physician “holding off.” Lol know wrong need people believe public health officials (although clearly that's really working us), want authorities tell people covid causes impotence high percentage cases. think whole lot people would wear masks correctly socially distance right quick.  That's entire point. face consequences. reason people seem feel ok roll dice health lives family friends.

It end one way another, either interventions natural course herd immunity. I'd prefer reduce lives lost long lasting health conditions simple measures. population numbers North Paulding anything like Atlanta Metro high school went 10 years ago, yes. 1000 students graduating class. 200 infections feasible number larger high schools are. ignoring all. quite aware following Covid since late December. 

It seems however uttely ignoring he/they could honest it. Face/mask coverings easily made cheap. made mine filters home rated N80 so. made home, even impromptu fashion people could make sell them. options. Since even bandana **BETTER* nothing all. Yet said nothing months **LIED** hundreds millions people. people died it. denying fact? seems are. 

You making sound valid useful masks N95s. see peolle protests wearing N95's? though American people stupid told truth give options. did, months fact. 

You made lot weird weird assumptions post, ignoring dead people could saved actect transparent honest sooner. worst thing interview, admits lying passing manner. like saying, *Yeah, Lied, oh well...*

Did watch interview? *fewer people. like gazillion facts disproving religion lol thinks she’s “waking up.” Oh go back good old days, idiots got together convinced smarter everyone else. Trump wont need steal election hes going win landslide.

The question whether Constitutional Amendment needed allow serve life. Hey can't police world matter hard try know. working pain expected level still backlog, anyone shows hospital expecting service going wait. situation sufficiently grim people going die waiting service. ""Unfurl pants Stephen! "" One long lasting memories high school. teacher relentless folding bottoms pants. media diet showed mass gathering anarchists tearing federal buildings ok, 50 people church event not. Something different going on? 

It's funny Chaz/chop story story anything bad right wing media blowing proportion. happened again? Oh, that's right people got killed(black men) got shut down. Buuutttt..... Dr Demon Semen agrees me...I've validated!


/s Half million die every year legal abortion too

It's sad many people claim care saving innocent human lives, yet turn blind eye becomes inconvenient basically tattoo see special light, see would used track someone better existing facial recognition software. reason tested would go school without knowing results? title thread indicating opening schools led this? Indeed, plus mitigation would likely million deaths.

People arent good alternatives. Right. putin that's making Americans wear masks flock Sturgis. Sure. explain telling literal, provable truth ""editorializing""?

Sorry, context may misleading. said dangerous editorialize extent; meaning every story do, suggested poster me. Yes, want truth story, hard shove headline fair concise way. said, examples seem alright. close issue. stands, trump voter view headlines attack rather reporting facts. Really, issue people always want judge something good four examples comment answering. explain appropriate judge examples ""bad""?

Again, may put wrong context way taking it. 'bad' sense wish werent so. also inappropriate news media tell us bad news. What's 'bad' sense driving react it. truly read 4 headlines actually remember facts rather think ""trump said something stupid""? 

There's important info virus. news getting seems fact check trumps comments. Trump 'main event' see headline either think ""ha! hate trump said something stupid again. Let read reinforce opinion him!"" ""Wow! Another attack Trump! one thing another?! I'm going get news somewhere else reinforce opinion him!"".

That's wrong. fault get judgy. dont seek read articles dont agree with. cant read something file away fact. take 'my view X right' 'their view X wrong'... thats people walk away with. feel like lot discussion around schools separated students teachers except pointing students vectors pass virus teachers. lot teachers parents school-aged children. feel like important fact overlooked. majority people wore masks protests. would say 90-95% wore attending one seeing footage it. 

This bike rally looks exact opposite masks “almost found”. biggest difference seem get. wouldn’t say either encouraged protests support civil injustice seems bit important motorcycles know ""I think principal would Dem hoax""

\- stupid parents, probably Social media + politics = good high school would measure length girl’s skirt thought might short yet it’s somehow impossible enforce mask wearing. want take child back school, yet. took school schools closed. We've safe virus free months, we'll see schools close within month. thoughtful article Rolling Stone. One comment hit home: viewed US many feelings like admiration, awe, hatred, etc. never like now: pity.... suspension got much public attention backlash reversed it. They'll see drop dead heart attack probably condemned fate vaccine prevent infections option... always pick stupid side argument, votes him. 

It's like saying ""It's weird watch cancer kill host"". choice; does. think trying gauge people saying, ""I trust it, think rushed"". though, I'll first line. think see people got vaccine going back normal life cave 2 weeks. Maybe Disney let's go maskless proof vaccine. Taiwan? Right? us zero socializing whole time, people pandemic unless it’s essential. Oh no! could've predicted this?! **incredulity** SEVERE understatement usually asymptomatic, immune. pass virus like anyone else. catch ""immune"" kid. United States’ failure contain spread coronavirus met astonishment alarm Europe - wait til see crowds Sturgis Rally China? published data trials like everyone else. Something Dr Alien DNA approves of, Bill Maher Robert Kennedy whining about. control mean?

People following measures **now**, midst pandemic. makes think people continue another year? Soo like .001 percent children America? 74.1 million children America. people Alaska make $7/hr bitter people make $600 per week smoking Xbox playing pot. thought border closed would like tattoo quantum dots. read Considering common cold belongs coronavirus family, mean duh. strain might go away newer covid future. labs overloaded demand processing tests. I’m PA haven’t test yet thankfully. family lives back GA. It’s improved somewhat past couple weeks. early July taking many people know 10+ days get results back. Hell, may still taking long some. mom tested Wednesday put priority list results works public directly. got results morning. _maybe_. There's still lots stories super-spreaders personally responsible 100 cases.

Where I'm 2 active cases. There's still mask mandate still let people parts world keep trade going, still let people travel back. could takes 1 particularly careless person mean lock-down again. Wearing mask helps prevent even without cases around. Since long-term effects serious viral infection conspiracy? hospitals doctors reporting issue conspiracy nut jobs? tell governments issuing warnings surveying patients? 

Easy brush conspiracy consider possibilities right? type stuff traumatize kids far far virtual learning year.
But babysitting! You’re right. anyone downvotes, chance alcohol. Personal responsibility imagine risking death watch paunchy middle aged wrestler lip sync terrible singing. Darwin got another herd idiots claim. Hold every administrator accountable attempted murder kids families. fleeces, also called gaiter masks often used runners, least effective. fact, wearing fleece mask resulted higher number respiratory droplets material seemed break larger droplets smaller particles easily carried away air.

This seems important single out. Makes sense though made fabric moisture wicking athletic wear. Sorry you’re going through. What’s crazy parents villanized letting kids go back school. It’s like parents choice. Jobs money actual thing people need make life work. maybe means staying away grandparents immunocompromised family friends. it’s vaccine available heard immunity...‘I don’t know. I’m scientist doctor. person sees lot people struggling trying work take care families time complete uncertainty.
Good luck sir! Wait saying sending kids back place sickness runs rampant without real way keep everyone safe working? I'm shocked. amazing family! logic 'keep economy going stock market stays rich still get paid."" thanks i'll gladly take rushed vaccine

Careful wish for! I'm Riptide said forever? new normal control. way get control follow measures. may take another year, two years, whatever. Point it, well, let virus take course guess, chance full immunity vaccine likely everything need. sub know math. There’s 160k dead idiot.

Doom already here.

It’s people like country tits laughed rest world. 

Look. Everyone's either actively hiding numbers systems incapable catching every story. look total mortality year year, look 2020, 'reported' covid deaths add up. number appears minimum 3x.

So let fix headline: Apparently way, way Americans expected died 2020 number forecasts working false assumptions See, Vaccines need administered schools, job sites, DMV etc...


Set database, keep track people vaccinated SS# link SS card ID/Drivers License


Don't get vaccinated, stay home, drive, can't buy car, fly list, boat, bus, train either. Somehow manage leave country, can't come back, unless get vaccinated. government tax stimulus's. kids know way hell I'll sending school. One sons cough refused go bike ride told us, ""This serious, could kill someone,"" told allergies extremely unlikely SARS-CoV-2. He's 7. 
But grown adults think okay send kids school right now. comparison same, time series also using raw count terrible metric USA Earth enormously higher population 2020 1939-1945. hard disagree original post's premise comparative data, soft disagree long-term comparison, maybe give virus additional 3 years completely unchecked could equal comparative scope.

drive theaters make comeback, one outside city 45 minutes west Toronto, fairing pretty well Nobody's spreading disease, idiot. That's fear mongering. know, simple grasp anything past MSM tells you. That’s sad. understand why. none. Right it’s likely kids staff tested days school started returned school anyways getting results didn’t feel bad bad all. worse people volunteer time rural communities. EMS crews better love going make bank doubt. Even 50% vaccine would probably allow restaurants businesses open. think possible, got sheet-zu  college pinkeye outbreak guy ate ass gave pinkeye that. infected whole dorm. think also highlighted need educational reforms. education children largely preparing cog industry. example bet could ask kids high-school could tell formula Pythagorean Theorem. Ask explain likely luck.

It's often university type critical thinking skills introduced. want improve general intelligence human race start teaching much earlier. course there's big incentive not-too-educated population provided ones exploiting it.

And unless everyone actively that— doesn’t matter. society get people wear pants, get people wear masks. Nevermind* “Unpaid” guess zero student loan debt top schools worth nothing? Crazy twisted county become getting free education, housing, meals isn’t considered payment. I’d take deal every day week feel blessed. fucking batshit. want keep stepdaughter home. live county fl doesnt even fucking mask order place. suprise cuz county run right wing nuts. got depressed vote mail ballot came in. Every option Republican, save judge two sheriffs running fucking racist pieces shit. amazing. mention neighboring county insane amount nee cases daily, hard track county obvious reasons. would struggle keep home certain options. mother wont even consider keeping out. Pile mother works freaking daycare care school aged kids (germ central). Yea, family gonna get corona next months basically guaranteed. praying come ok. Unrelentless would good word describe frightened rabbit never said did? graveyard gaffe! hard? want open schools current pandemic you, whether say loud not, acceptable number deaths ok with.

If acceptable number deaths ok with, crazy person comment public policy. Saying otherwise say perpetual lockdown prevent **even one life** lost. serious consequences side ledger need taken account policy response pandemic. shit. fucking dumb.

Like saying Mars vacations happening year. Indica still federally illegal. shit country. could clean virus existence would building Clorox factories vaccine. group complete morons. everyone gets infected that's less people vote, making cheating process much easier current Admin. Non-mask wearers like... ""Wait! Wtf?! Why?

Keep shit we'll see get shit canceled next year. lol, many Americans resist unions proud working death. Didn’t buy significant amount Apple stock low 200’s Remember incubation period 7-14 days. kids showed school already infected contagious. Hah fucks Portland anything say it. Reportedly testing shit. anyone sick tired seeing “GRIM MILESTONE” headline? It’s disgustingly used. camps area also closed summer. Take run find information. manufactured method taking complete control food production entire country. outbreak particular place manufactured lead food shortages purposeful prepare. six months pandemic get this?? absurd. Won’t somebody please think children... used laugh Helen lovejoy serious tone hey Simpsons predicted shit refuse cooperate even lie there.

Well anything antisocial fools they'd wear damn mask. Throw Russia window lol clear people idea they're doing. That’s works valiant effort youre saying shut schools, slow spread virus? hmm let sleep it, im gonna get back one Workers rights that’s hilarious Peak efficiency! stupid. OUTDOOR rally. know protests masks + outdoors barely anything. avoid masks prove point, they're gonna get people infected. Decent proportion? gives like 99% wealth charity lol  hear? Kids bring home, they're firewall.

It is. make claim dude Especially since one dude Twitter texts source school admin office saying staff tested positive like 3 days ago. even talking about? ""Lower quality""? always can’t decide it’s “guaranteed annuity” “ponzi scheme”. Lol don’t think parents believe child can’t get COVID. think parents choose paying bills, accepting child become asymptomatic carrier. hearing from? Controlling virus would make 1000x easier.

Kids Thailand, Vietnam, China might disruptions quarantine large things going forward. arent seeing significant cases throughout world? South Korean scientists state expect immunity last year. Sweden: We’re going allow certain level SARS-CoV-2 community transmission order achieve herd immunity.

USA: Hold ventilator. majority vaccines worked won’t keep getting/spreading it, reduce symptoms. ~~On advice district counsel~~ pleased revoke suspension student. right. need competent leadership come alternate solutions. administration ignoring complexity problem, denying even exists. Trump threatened cut funding California due forest fires last year. wanted cut funding State needed Trump wanted publicity stunt. Please enlighten anything trying stop world wide pandemic ?? Cloth masks better think. There's flurry research achieve electrostatic ""filtering"" non-cloth masks gets teeny tiny particles. many use filters well two three layers fabric. seal problem important get good fit use nose wire. think we're helping everyone around us wearing them. Who

Would've

Thought True. Neither seems like great place right though lol. population difference vs now? Seems relevant. would also bet money significantly higher portion population back capable sustaining people today. Trump signed $400 per week unemployment executive order, work? go effect New York? even know could that. confusing... many colleges &amp; unis going online means teachers staff safe, isnt necessarily happening millions people work k-12 level.

I mean get people want it, like that's reason control virus first place. ppl charge don’t care us Sheeple. Go slaughter must enzyme Troponin Oh. That's cute. happen, cause ""socialism"". worries, reasonable leap take. need crackedt mess sooooo bad tomorrow😂 Fully online. decision made long time ago thank goodness!  Time prove wrong. Even vaccine 50% effective, people take it. government claim victory, Trump reelected we'll back normal life January 2021. Studies show death rates vastly inflated due hospital incentives live covid19 population like flu. important all, go back normal wash hands (like we're always supposed to) wear masks indoors. 

If think life going back was, insane can't help you. way life fundamentally changed entire generation. go ahead take vaccine declare hero. Let's hope side effects older next kin show trailing diseases result rushed, politically motivated vaccine. real question many next week?  Vote. anything regarding politics, it’s better expect worst trust people""

Yeah plan's working well. Sure, NYC/proximity city. Look work they’ve done progress that’s made. I’m there. definitely agree. What’s worse? I’m school bus driver tell 80% bus drivers across United States senior citizens high risk. driver 40 ft bus, there’s way absolutely enforce mandatory masks start seeing cases alone. Poor man. schoolyear started, even. district NJ said masks required one refusing wear one sent principal immediately send child home. Okay, looks like month ago 100 deaths day, maxed averaging around 300 deaths day. roughly. entirely right far off. hope number goes higher till shut school will. Along swath population  you, Besty DeVos? body makes vaccine. called antibodies. Wait til parents start dying, moms suddenly arms. it. know works that’s PAY PEOPLE STAY HOME. course awful stupid country won’t that. Like say, death cult really interesting. I’m going reading. Thanks! makes lot sense.  would never put anyone danger reopening schools middle deadly pandemic.

They even mandate masks. high risk teachers, claim, able support claims data. countries never closed schools, others re-opened quickly. i.e. watch right wing media....

They'll say anything expediency they've spent last decades learning capture program audience. That's reality little purchase years. Thanks!

I wonder people look Italy earlier acted accordingly. One infected sneeze whole hallway infected lmao crazy Well hope parents get it. gonna slaughter. news US since Cheetos' election label. 2020 sure making harder satire outlets business though. Yes! Thank that. Massively different treatment regimen now. Also many southern states suppressing actual rates death. thousands excessive deaths year... less accidents ones happening Start petition secede states Canada. Let's see bad really want it.

If deem worthy awarded 5 free liters syrup. probation period ends entitled poutine rations like rest us framework makes country possible. True Patriots!   Iowa gov Kim Reynolds says seriousness it’s bad April positive percentages lower now, completely disregarding actual number cases. forgot teachers. Shocker put cheap chips in? /s

Honestly, Gates one best billionaires there, best one. really surprised that. lady grade fruit loop. ties 1918 pandemic “deployment radio waves”, 1968 due “new satellite systems deployed” etc, natural conclusion COVID caused 5G. Good God people get stupid. assumes vaccine 100% effective. could almost look form selection. 100% effective, people love might risk idiots vaccinate. let's elect dumb guy, regular shmuck experience political acumen. businessman went bankrupt multiple times, tax dodging everyman long list accusations, lawsuits, politically incorrect non-speech like speeches. What's worst could happen?

We've become shithole countries ban coming.  


In far distance, quiet whisper, ""what emails"" heard, outside brush amongst tall trees. Easter yet? fuck talking about? control literally one city Australia. Get head ass. also won’t go right away, it’s new program outside normal unemployment system could take months set up. Trump said practically immune.. Gosh saw disgusting sight today. getting car spotted van driver opening door get van. Guy gloves, mask, proceeded pick mouth

You would think half year global pandemic, people would learn Lol. look Japan, then. We've schools open almost entire time. closed month March it. doesn’t work. might well signed order mandating every citizen gets pony. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

TIL one three Americans absolute morons. virus apparently efficient spreading outdoor gatherings don’t involve looting. Man, they’re REALLY gonna hate dying, totally messes schedule &amp; it’s huge inconvenience. Ah it’ll go away see downvoted someone wishes didn’t kids! He’s also 89. Even lost 99% fortune, would still rich rest life lmao. heart goes :( Absolutely horrible. somebody EU country never even crossed mind corona vaccine might cost money. went Texas New England exactly one time visit friend moved High School football field (arena?) bigger state’s University’s football field. 

Blew mind. Probably typo. ""Chip"" $3 like it. Please see comment reply below. believe faith much know optimistic. feel differently, would ask look death tolls see think seems special... Covid-19 highly contagious. probably least dozen infected show symptoms, yet. might say things there’s probably single survivor coming ventilator tell straight face worth getting could go fucking party express “freedom”. People stupid, entitled &amp; unbelievably selfish. It’s disheartening. valid point. masks could politicized, vaccine too. I....am....SHOCKED

/s One rushed like scares me.

They're rushing testing, they're saving TONS time beg money go meaningless paperwork getting downvoted this? flu shots pointless. never get haven’t sick years Spain spiking 10 year process 

They shorten scientific testing, shortened bureaucratic red tape time scientists would spend begging funding, holy shit. 98K schools US, serving 58 million students; thinking, given \~1% population tested positive, number falls realm reasonable.

Some areas schools active/potential cases others. forthcoming reports too. also issue fewer students tested testing backlogs pretty long right now.

The school year also starting. think number going skyrocket quickly unless kinds incidents force schools (and education departments) abandon fantasies reopening without incident go full-bore (often half-assed online fallback plans). We're retarded nation article days ago said 30+ American dont enough eat? gonna help Bill? call Big Brain Time?  It’s impressive think Trump didn’t actively make situation worse insisting hoax would getting second term right without pulling coup usps Friday night. Literally say trust experts defer everything them. would worst right would look great.

Instead deal constant failed reopening increasing infection death. We’re sure. top men it.

Who??

Our top men. Wtf Trump? Fucking reddit man. Hi, every cop wears mask live. Broad generalizations good one country. sub even ""no politics"" rule? clearly enforced. highly agree you. Sadly understand document. already read absolutely nowhere say mortality rate 1%.

Please copy paste exact text think states this.

I'll wait... Thanks sharing, seen one therapeutics before! Probably topical relevant, accurate statement I’ve heard GOD DAMNED MINUTE. amen. prayer hands. etc. /u/Alien_Illegal posted really interesting: so, predominant way.

The predominant ways mouth, nose **eyes**.  UK population: 60-something million

Japan population: 120-something million

NZ population: 5 million.

Japan, UK: major transport hubs respective areas.

NZ: dead end.

No fucking wonder they're well. School administration roles unfortunately tend attract power hungry assholes know there’s little literal children stop them. think criminals, particularly ones commiting serious crime, would WANT hide identity. Hey now, punish poor leeches like that. I'll take ass junior high's school colors red black. I'll bet they've issues! realize hypocritical ""journalist"" point outdoor gatherings religion limited 50 people Portland literally mass gathering destructive white anarchists disguises protestors months straight?. Get real, fake news. continued attack religion godless anarchy fine. Two Men bringing college students hotels Arkansas Hawaii let students party fun like normal college. say won’t impact local population, seeing Hawaii surge cases, growing concern ICU capacity, seems like irresponsible thing do. America legitimately crack shit hope get help need. dumpster. This! noticed numbers &amp; cases going dramatically hospitals started using “new system”. haven’t able find much regarding opinions new system actual doctors &amp; it’s actually cluster fuck White House blatantly &amp; purposely hiding legitimate Data. requested help China believe. even allowed coronavirus... ""Curable?"" morally right help others, Enlightened Self-interest. 

If let covid19 keep circulating around globe come back bite us. People bring disease back here. 

Addtionally longer mutating, chances get worse - infectious, severity symptoms, severity effects even get point existing vaccines close enough work. last something happened whooping cough people vaccinated still get outbreak changed much:  Erm. hate hearing resources wasted someone like that. Seeing hallway makes cringe. I’ve become afraid indoor places crowds, blows newly covid-evolved mind bits. Fuck that. Yea there’s difference dying dying 70 years now. can't multiply X comes numbers deaths, hospitals limit time treat, equipment use, doctors nurses treat space patients.

 one phrase morons use hate "" elderly people deadly for"". us elderly relatives people higher risk groups would sort like stay alive. willing die someone else thats noble doesnt fucking work way.

 also growing number side effects linger long initial infection occurs quite terrible worth risk even lower risk groups. even know faith vaccine helping things point. anti-mask morons likely anti-vax fuckstupid reason, too. good real world example this, check documentary American Factory. Please provide link source 1% mortality rate.  Think money save year defunding future social security! That's work. send emails saying someone's reported feeling well (never actual diagnosis taking week get test results US) buildings specific areas. offices empty right essential areas staffed every day usually areas get reported. close building specific area day clean. usually close building someone place day otherwise close specific area work in. Last two times reported people feeling ill, five days apart worked area. I'm sure second person contracted first. Luckily region major hotspot anymore things relatively calm now. least dozen words phrases never want hear pandemic gets people chill get couch lock, I'd say loonngg overdue They're yolo mode they're 'I'm gonna live forever!' mode moms know go work can’t stay home online school kids. Mine high schooler leave work own, parents can’t younger kids. supposed do? travel bans work well fighting pandemics. delays it. south korea success great government intervention: massive testing + contact tracing stop virus early.  Bill Gates good getting groceries family throughout coronavirus time period due similar situation former delivery service beginning pandemic.  Going store right opening time found people generally avoid proximity people. care don't. shop early morning right stores open Lowest meaning best according world, read manual read books person woman man camera tv. OMG I'm taking medical scientific advice ""Redditor"" fails understand kids go home families significantly higher risk harmed killed virus. Let em die [please idiots think antifa &amp; rioters “burning cities ground”. Boasting survival rate 99% disregarding 1% 350 million still fuck load dead people well disregarding high number survivors long-term damage.

It’s terrible say, don’t give fuck idiots. I’m bummed they’re going consume hospital resources &amp; ones survive probably drain healthcare system scarred lungs heart disease. I’d prefer die. 
M mUsT fEaRmOnGeRiNg PpL NeEdS mEdIcAl TrEaTmEnTs CoUlDnT gEt HeLp. FaKe NeWs. AlSo I'm DuMb ShIt cAnT fOlLoW sImPlE fAcT - deniers likely correct. Even so, predominant way. course there's still small chance someone get even wearing mask, that's acceptable risk. mom's friend Trump? thats whats written there.

you use brain come conclusion that, considering last two weeks, almost 100.000 kids contracted corona virus, opening schools kind insane akin deliberately murdering kids. People legitimate concerns safe vaccine considering would fastest produced vaccine ever. wording poll kinda bad well. School started 9 likely got elsewhere. incubation period two weeks many asymptomatic already. person asked, think ""motivated reasoning"" means thought process causes believe propaganda. 6 ft tall ate plants right attest. Also preserve food later. took day apricots. I’m saying wrong reading sent kinds red warning beacons head. trust AC man? worked home repair trade entire life tell sound like told truth getting quality honest service m. even close. think India Brazil reliable? Ahhhh see, tdil. Read cdc study linked report decide npr engaged responsible journalism, scaremongering. Example: infected adults 20 times likely hospitalized. 576 kids U.S. hospitalized March 1 July 25, 1 died. Yeah, hear concerns but... I’m island. We’ve LUCKY cases. think we’ve less 30 deaths. 

There’s 14 day quarantine want stay. nothing open literally got $5,000 fine sitting beach (you could walk; don’t stop) people stayed away. 

Now we’re seeing cases rise; it’s mandatory 14 day quarantine honor system. I’ve Costco (first thing see right airport) people stopping stock quarantine. 2 cashiers report this; bars open. Empty, open. 

They talking ankle bracelets one time visitors. Violation rights? don’t think so. government can’t figure shit out. honor system isn’t going cut it. would rush get it. concerned employers require work. maybe health insurance require it. Masks symptomatic people sure. need everyone wearing mask. Really, sick people stay home nah got brainwashed agent oregano. country real leadership, entirely possible eradicate virus country entirely we’d learn second language. yeah cos didn’t realise it’d become news. 

no thing small-town-mentality anymore. Yes, right. India, counting ways different, thats why.
1 hundred thousand known one Lakh! high transmission still, CDC describes Covid death kid ‘literally one million’. Kids risk Covid, risk drive school. CDC unequivocally advocates open schools. I’m 6th lowest Covid state per capita, schools decided close. CDC guidelines. 9 cases packed hallway actually bad. Uh. No. 1st phase 3 UAE. first UAE world. Good all, need hope trail findings accurate headline. That's opinion friend...sounds hypocritical tho!

Kind like driving Ford every right hate Ford.

Do hate car automaker? 🤔 Well probably thought manageable back then. probably think something that's going happen can't hide house forever. fractions.

Keep shit school can't help ok! 100% Americans would say vaccine came Communist China. think misleading. study covered wide range severity contained many mild cases would hospitalized today. title alarmist. see people go hospital mild cases end problems. Going hospital mean worse mild disease go hospital. patients went hospital beginning pandemic, criteria admission could different time place. lot unknown fear, going hospital mild disease understandable. might known difference mild severe, could thought would get severe better safe go get checked out. Many possibilities. 

Bottomline: many mild cases hospital change disease severity effects, unless ventilator, mild cases get. expect mild cases outside hospital see similar results. title fair. Idk one know sitting around. LIVES Showing way things Let’s call school peaceful protest covid eradicated within confines. Time lawyer up. going get expensive many organisations. Loco parentis. laughs bitter, might covid don’t think Holy Spirit acts prophylactic COVID-19. Yeah. middle school moral panic stupid letter students advertising sexual availability sweatband color.

Decades later still can't understand adults charge stupid enough think actually thing. exact comment gets skin. see Reddit almost guarantee majority people saying clue phases even meant vaccine trials, prior April 2020. theory next-level stupid. moment realize soggy disco biscuit smarter dukey No, stop reporting numbers gets high.  mean kids, imagine going home school parents even grandparents fifty hours, look whether they'd allowed. many reasons lack reported cases, malicious innocent, please confuse anecdotal evidence sound theory clear (at least top them) want problem sloved.
Once problem sloved, lost reason exist. center-left pragmatic President,

Leftist here. ""pragmatic"" mean [heavy support [assassinating US [committing trillion dollars new nuclear 

Or mean passing small change healthcare system still left US worst healthcare developed world declaring victory.

(Yes, yes, yes, much better Trump Bush, low bar.) God fucking hate stupidity country much, like everyone ego power boner Lmao article 3.6 roentgens... great, terrible... travel warning??? can't get unless citizen also cases managed mandatory isolation border lol genuinely believe parents kids expecting never go school, eventually work and, end road, move live lives? low-effort troll?

I'm going troll, since bring ""not gonna \[sic\] kids unless career..."" - dude, fucking career think going get accommodates full-time childcare homeschooling well? 

Fuck. Off. ""Global pandemic killing hundreds thousands people"" something parent prepare for.  Canada, need socially distance us. catching Karen plague. ""Organizers dubbed event Portland “Riots Revival,” hoped flip script bringing worship, prayer acts kindness city."" Remember “only 15” cases turned 5 million 160,000 deaths? want live country 17 deaths deadliest days. Sincerely, American. do. It’s exhausting would love (am seriously considering buying UV-C lamps). Although risk *may* indeed low (how low??), really don’t feel comfortable taking chances. Plus, feel it’s something regardless covid. Supermarket storage rooms, shipping containers warehouses real filthy places. worker shortages, additional stress, fear all, hygiene practices may ironically even less adequate. There’s bunch pathogens could end packages say rats/mice, roaches crawl pee/poop them. think it’s good hygiene practice, don’t want get sick either way. Death scared disease obese 25 year old going back college next week. also even scared live possible permanent lung damage causes. Lmaooooo exactly I'm bored people telling success eliminating community transmission low population density island. isn't. factors, city town population density similar cities populated countries. Also, UK island shit show. I'm Scotland even difference bojo approach (laugh shaking hands nearly dying fucking covid) Oor Nic approach (wear fucking mask stay inside) massive. Competency leadership essential virus going managed said. statement ridiculous. Essentially said bad news believed it’s “honest”. Complete bullshit. 

I wear mask social distance also don’t think good news conspiracy. read actual studies rather sensationalized news. 

My large city “hotspot” month ago. Now, cases hospitalizations continue go down. According city public health department, according trump database. believe it? According you, shouldn’t, it’s good news. Complete nonsense. Better, potentially sharing drinks close (drunk) contact almost certainly wearing masks, travel spot (in knows many groups, etc.) back wherever (all place.) starts get dicey really quickly scale.

That I'm opposed beaches, etc. open. much sand (though people breaking laws glass, alcohol, dogs/leashes almost constant many beaches), bathrooms, choke points walkways, however many gift shops, restaurants, gas stations, everything else go ""day trip beach."" need arrest put infection camps. around world denier camps doctors. really need stop touting 3.5% World Health Organization doesnt agree you. Sorry, implying? Would correct way 2,150,000? would America. bit truth that, fair. There's reason influenza season summer... happen still obviously course covid certainly exception. That, ""covid shots"" slow either. Geez. they're shocked kids getting it. least think schools would pay attention science lessons. theyd well compensated, unlike teachers I’m fan leadership crisis, /r/coronavirus crowd wants able beat reason, including reasons aren’t valid. activity doesn’t help cause claim motivated science, politics. feel like I'm reading Chinese forum posts here, everything coded avoid government censors.

Peace harmony, Chinese call it. Yes, 21,50,000 2,15,000 number rising number shows tendency, leading change quality (from quantity), threatening existence people India, due pandemic economic depression fascism, side effects! i'm sayng negative consequences, commenting much said time demonstrably hyperbolic accepted uncritically matter fact people saying things time presented experts, really made justify views basis. infact even really challenged time even though things claimed completely outlandish; day nobody even tries hold responsible grandiose claims made.
 
expert opinion, always potentially valuable addition conversation, rarely pure, unbiased intellectually rigorous we're lead believe. think economists start talking ""500,000 job losses"" ""an overnight recession"", turns economists completely wrong, also undisclosed financial ties influencing predictions know take massive grain salt regards extent usefulness limits expert opinion, well ability journalists hold opinions account. different experts right telling us readily apparent bullshit children able spread disease, misinterpreting data sweden justify lockdowns, like told us bother masks beginning outbreak.

rejecting questioning expert opinion *not* par either science, reality denialism. that's wanted convey. Seriously, 9? still freaking this?   Shocked, tell shocked. 8 times zero cases still zero cases USA Titanic

And solution jump ship took WAY long realize Veterans Administration Virginia. probably would infected even Arrest  guessing here, work school system I'd assume problem want get kids' case masks, rather dealing parents. almost always parents cases. Appreciate concern choice smoke... I'm suggesting go vacation/move, rather smart-ass reply smart-ass original comment.

My point this, big theme right comment. lot people country frustrated current political structure current economic environment. I'm happy talk bigger picture stuff, I'm sure I'll agree on. 

Bottom line instead making broad comments like F country, taking pissed energy putting towards change alot ppl want see. That's attempting say comment. 

I interact business owners, employees unemployed friends daily, tell unfortunately country bought division BS that's pushed. say again, everything LIFE CHOICE.

You choose either say something &amp; importantly take action make difference, say anything anything. People forget second part, they're quick say something however quick take action. Hell yeah, bro!  I'm pointing absurdity using statistic make sense use. need tens millions babysitters. 

And need agree socialize. believe political compass website lists slightly right full blown authoritarian. amusing note, based solely past voting record Biden economic right Trump. 9 cases *so far* Oh yeah. I'm saying Trump vs Clinton it'd contest. Ted Cruz would win easily vs Clinton. Hell, Think prbobly beat Biden too. current situation “much worse“ April. peak daily deaths April 2749, peak daily deaths July 1465, we’re coming peak since then, [per case death counts. 

While it’s clearly true “second wave” artifact increased testing, reasonable inference death rates actually getting cases April March June July, able test now.

We cautious school reopens, flu season starts, even half-ass measures, like wearing masks, seem like greatly reduce spread. True, would probably longest problem aside causing total destruction (e.g., war zone) institutions, workplaces economy complete disarray. pandemic seems 1-2x per century incident (1918 Flu, Polio, Covid) something potentiality (plus many social economic stresses began move socioeconomic ladder households later half 20th century, 30-40 years invention antibiotics.)

Locally could lots things, floods, hurricanes, civil unrest, workplace strike. single campus/site could act violence, fire, illness excess substitutes, anything facilities related.

Those usually last long; though at-risk households tend worst leave policies least income wether disruption. Support family friends inconsistent too.

For individual students families, many many reasons forced go specific school unsafe (threats violence going school) harmful (long term psychological damage) means would make arrangements (pull out, private schools, inter-district transfers, GED/early grad programs, etc.) poor options (e.g., registering new district someone else's address, criminalized.) get Facebook. propagate carefully years disinformation strategy. Well fair light comes sun , cause cancer cell mutation like watching slowest car crash history. Half people car screaming watch everyone else wearing seatbelts.

&amp;#x200B;

Just dumbest shit, fuck america, fuck capitalism, fuck system demands people sacrifice lives asshole make money. Scientific data indicating improvements considered suspicious manipulation. US reporting fewer new cases since reporting hospitals transferred CDC Trump donor's company. figure 150K deaths covid way 200K+ excess all-cause deaths period lots difference come covid. far little acknowledgement millions long term illnesses likely result people survive infection. disbelieve everything positive hear, weigh conflict interest. Good numbers coming California? [Whoops, cases [due ""computer CDC director (Trump appointee) saying reopen schools spread virus them, working scientists [blocked Yes, holing house home schooling kids much better idea that. forget TV telling us wear masks? [People sense knew better even absolute incompetence everything US government done pandemic tell us credibility.

That said, actual scientific publications (that easy misinterpret, however) (some) non-US sources nearly bad stuff get home here.

In case, expecting ready worst dooming, common sense circumstances.  president then? Two. Different. Things. NZ strong response quickly eliminate it. isolated island, easily keep track let in, choose keep out. Nobody sneaking NZ. 

Compare Canada, done well virus, see damn near every day there’s article Americans trying (successful not) sneak Canada. Nobody downplaying NZ’s response virus. response damn near perfect. shut rest world live somewhat normal life obviously minus tourism (a big part life), don’t need masks social distancing anymore.

TDLR: 1. beat virus need strong leadership &amp; willingness people follow. 2. it’s beaten, certainly helps island there’s limited number ways enter country &amp; much easier control borders. we're great suck /s

*sigh* frustrating. We're great position country combat virus also wealthy enough keep citizens afloat ready surpass countries things start tilting towards normal. nope, killing citizens, we're setting nations overpower us financially well. New Zealand best healthcare world definition capitalism means private owned economy. Greed human condition. sources reporting increased cases, posters celebrated problem believing it. did, months ago. yes, Senate Repubs killed it. sitting waiting discussed, refuse.  New Zealand population 5 million....California alone 7x that. Let sink go praising lol  Exactly - man-made polio epidemic disastrously faulty vaccine. wasn’t long ago, really — 1955. Thanks making point. Listening Dr Fauci would good idea even message want hear. went too. Humans capped around 130 interpersonal connections. Bigger small towns villages start disconnect. However like almost everything else nature overcome it. sent hospital ship back treated 22 incidents. 

What overload talking about? happen? Italy safer Denmark point America. things do? higher-pay jobs offer 4 weeks right away US. I've seen, often offered 2 weeks start, slowly add years company.

I 4 weeks I've company 5 years. started 2 weeks. switched companies I'd probably offered 2 weeks (although might able negotiate more).

Honestly, I've 4 weeks first time entire career, know could work anything less. need give enough break job go crazy. feel really bad annoyed past self everyone else deal less (or none). disabled survivors bigger problem

Potentially Permanent heart damage found 70% cases regardless case severity. 

It isnt rare think. link paper mobile, gootle friend. dude mind. Highly doubt people listen him. Oh, thanks link! look alternatives realize systems need even blood greasing.  make big glass box people protest don’t infect rest us. call freedom box they’ll jizz pants go it...from “freedom”. Or, case measles Minnesota, members immigrant community believed religious leaders. Washington state progressive evers , like followers great scientist Jenny McCarthy Kennedy offspring. try taking 1% Jeff Bezos' money suddenly Lenin.  totally agree, buffoon, never become president.

I'm independent can't vote yet, look Americans political system, R pretty much make similar idiotic mistakes. I’m reading UK. made mess things even can’t believe shit show that’s happening US. People jailed kind man slaughter.  Dells awesome Wisconsin flooded Illinois plates months. Ignorant. least Swedish scientist said 1,000 deaths, they're 5,700 deaths. Full Fact [reckon depending whether exclude anyone died days positive test, didn’t listed primary cause death cert.

Worth noting also say it’s likely still undercount overall (we shamefully low testing capacity around peak here, buy it). wrong. possihle infections actually come school. None less. crowded school created scenario drastically increase spread virus. get wrong he's blame we've also got pin blame people well. many people simply taking seriously thinking hoax No, suddenly want adjust think fair ask why. assuming New York (and possibly others) learned lesson behave sensibly result. Also: hashtags twitter Facebook Instagram, Reddit. voters people understand basic cause effect.

If pandemic election COVID-19 Good Health, voters elected COVID-19. Amen!!! hit nail head! Unless risk it’s really bad cold. 

Seriously. Every time catch cold could pneumonia lungs collapse, mono, bronchitis, variety diseases severe could cause long term damage. That's speculation point. mountains studies confirming it. Look COVID antibody tests? mean existence asymptomatic people also proves this. many places can't even get tested COVID unless symptoms severe. September best case, think urgency levels roof right definitely think things want figured soon gotta emergency distribution correctly anything shows us public schools need teach science. miss family

Because life pretty close go visit family week. give little extra distance usually spend time together outside.

It add little risk, consider worth it. isn’t science works.

Zelenko quack.

Please stop getting health information Facebook.

I promise HCQ worked real world, we’d know now. really think every single doctor world aside charlatans big conspiracy?

Do think someone really wants keep pandemic going worse want economy recover? fighting ignorance. Fair enough. generally look New England Journal Medicine studies surrounding virus. reliable. Sweden Stockholm worst hit region allowed spread throughout country.

The virus mostly spread via returning travelers. visiting tourists. appears common misconception. Meaning people regions may picked virus Stockholm returned home anybody knew travel restrictions Sweden introduced. Travel restrictions Stockholm lifted June 15. despite decades law, PSA's, evidence decreasing auto vehicular mortality , 1/3 people regularly wear seatbelt. Snip snap, snip snap! may well go eventually, statement remains true facts say otherwise. Yes true. it’s also science works. Information changes facts emerge. don’t know everything. initially assume worse cautious learn more, adapt. certainly shouldn’t exaggerate scare, information changes science proceeds. people incapable critical thinking ready jump change able say “durp, so-called scientists don’t know talking about.” virus spreads people, matter visitors returning home.


Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland started reporting first cases beginning March.


Norway 5.4 million population, peaked 425 cases March 28, far 256 deaths

Finland 5.5million population, peaked 211 cases Apr 6. far 331 deaths

Denmark 5.7 million population, peaked 391 cases Apr 7, far 617 deaths


Sweden 10.1 million population, peaked 1803 cases June 24,  far 5,763 deaths.


The pattern see 4 countries got Covid-19, three took action, peaked far new cases per day month, total less 20% deaths 4th country. want see actual proof government saying make awful death count look better. Sure they'd definitely never that. Poor USA 
Nobody wants them........ even covid. Tbh Idk, think Football probably cancelled year, unless pull miracle, entire population, atleast risk vaccinated like January/February. Canada, border usa. amazing see difference. extra cautious here, restaurants still open, patios open outdoors. Masks mandatory city past months. Stores still limits many inside. Schools supposed open nothing set stone yet. Ontario 5 million people Michigan neighbors much higher case count. deniers exist well government done much better job leading. FUCKING RIGHT!!!!???  excited get back together actually service full worship team ~~everything~~ collection plates everyone going come quarantine,"" Foster told WMUR. says hi he’s rigged election Trump shoe in.... #MAGA chump! Yes said believe it. shall pass. Hang there. This. Also, La definitely tale two populations, first big spike came Nola mask orders place since mid March believe. second spike rest state experiencing significant infections first time. Nola, pop ~400k hit 800+ cases day first spike, second spike topped around 100 back &lt;50 improving. US individual states big there’s lot nuance numbers maybe don’t get unpacked deeply could be. Quit spitting lies near 5.5%. like 3.3% Alabama. Figured Florida may question Here's thing though vast majority people lose jobs even hours cut. Hell work window Manufacturer actually hours increased May double business projected us make month steadily trended upward past 2 months. 

We slated work 6 days week Christmas least Ass teeth. Thanks nightmares. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  state go to? SC, I've seen pretty much everyone wearing past weeks. Maybe like everywhere. live laws strict feel like you’re held hostage? Sounds dramatic me. Lots “smart” Americans argue masks effective even indoors! Look well turned out...  ☝☝☝ believe without seeing evidence.

You believed numbers before, though? Why? reading case notes death certificates before? statement way general.

I see point: data wrong doesn‘t matter fast get results. However, black white, percentage game. false tests would surely beneficial results average come back lot quicker stop spread average. many results wrong (especially false negatives) harmful ofcourse.

Maybe pedantic - think beneficial statements consider least parameters. Nope. made extraordinary assertion. companies accusing? say hi putin me. Donny said slow testing, hear? someone currently section PA lots NYers New Jerseyans looking escape, they're last people worry moment. see cars full stores they're compliant, always respectful people's space - always cover snotholes, really want anyone days. surprised see numbers reflecting behavior. Good work guys! kids spread people easily die it, moron Sure, infections rise usually delay infections hospitalised cases going up. It’s politicized since March. I’m sorry. I’m similar issues mainly mother. northern Florida 62, I’m 32, stayed home SINGLE day since March. Every day goes reason. masks wears rarely also go think wears around she’s alone family won’t won’t call they’re willfully ignorant. I’m one common sense it’s incredibly infuriating many reasons.

So also agree mother end succumbing ignorance denial, dying far, far meant inability 

Stay

The

Fuck

at

Home 

Until

It’s

Safe.

She plenty money job. need leave house anything. afford groceries delivered anything else wants. oh no. Gotta risk whole house child doesn’t stay home.

She stay home protect family seems cannot even understand protects and/or willfully chooses ignore many facts.

And finding resentful ignorance inability see she’s ever does, late then. imagine becomes sick say it’s corona even tests positive and/or symptoms can’t breathe go ventilator. highly doubt accept reality. 

She’ll say something else despite medical professionals diagnoses contradict entirely.

Sorry length vent meant reply spilled out, apologize wish best. Yea fuck grandparents give die slow painful death, amirite?

You people need get heads asses. Where? entire planet? 

People accept adhere mask mandates feel it’s necessary. Putting masks New Zealanders *could* risk situation fewer people adhere mandate months line actual need use masks community spread. Putting masks millions people country zero cases might way slightly reduce risk new outbreaks, always make right call so?

Mitigations seen taken “budget”. might afford B. start soon people might run patience sooner, on. LOL'ing Canada averaged 400 day week.  Seems perfectly reasonable. reason, context help us better understand way hospital systems work, way causes death assigned, way funding streams work releasing compensation hospitals state federal governments, etc. etc. 

If supposed automobile fatality counted COVID casualty complications related illness (e.g. person stroke road, directly related clotting COVID months earlier), would seem reasonable count COVID-related. 

If, hand, system blithely inflexibly bureaucratic way counts deaths, that's something case study could help us come terms with. depressing milestone even bother disinfecting? According Harvard &amp; others COVID-19 lives 2-3 days surfaces.

Not like amazon packages delivered disinfected. I've spent past six months pretty much total isolation, matter much sucks, still blessing. Seems like fantastic article - someone please cut &amp; paste? Paywall me.@ hope right mean yes that's brothers family usually Great job! real valuable skills. Given age, probably learning would school. know it’s really hard work though, remember it’s okay take breaks. Good luck! denounce mechanism emergency drug distribution that's place decades? sister cancer receiving chemo EAU. denounce doctors giving six months?

In case COVID emergency authorization would likely impact medical professionals small number high risk patients. want give choice. don’t know. don’t even know many people died Covid. US 40,000 excess deaths year Covid hasn’t attributed to. also know North East hammered early testing capabilities laughable ton positive cases recovered never tested. 

We also know death rate rises hospitals hit capacity turn patients away. lot cases require hospitalization die aren’t able receive acute care. means “breaking point” death rate goes great HOLY SHIT. USA running 54,000/day... LOL stupid people. stupid people charge. inevitable politicization vaccines here.

If Trump wins November, left take vaccine trust Trump.

If Trump loses November, right take vaccine (more already) even hoax now, also microchips.

In end, like locksdowns mask mandates, without enough participation, wont work.

And lead us consequences: un-ending pandemic, forever planetary ban, end empire. way distract/deflect Two birds, one stone; cripple tourist economy relegate incoming spread?

I'm Yap they've 0 cases far. Maybe collapse finally get fish free food backyard instead paying $9 shitty processed American mush.  duopoly brought us election choosing favorite rapist/racist/potential pedophile. still noone chooses third party got word happened. 

That's before, too. reviewing actual case notes point? don’t convince me! I’d first line job qualified me. Since I’m able work home indefinitely I’ll happy enough March.

I hate working home :-( one sounds like conspiracy kook ""Several sources indicated ESPN Big Ten presidents, following meeting Saturday, ready pull plug fall sports season, wanted gauge commissioners university presidents chancellors Power 5 conferences -- ACC, Big 12, Pac-12 SEC -- fall line them""

F. Exactly. going get every kid hall close? big school even everyone knows everyone. kids returning, refuse risk teachers, staff, students, families.

Whooping cough went around last year awful school shut that's nearly contagious Meanwhile Australia... Americans getting special treatment, we've told whole world FO rate daily case started increase around 20th June. Daily deaths started rise around July 10th. looks like lag time 3 weeks diagnosis death. Average countries 4-5 weeks. 
So start project death rate month time amount current daily cases. 
Daily cases 50000 month now. would surprised see death rate 4000-5000 people every day month September. excess death rate also 33% higher confirmed COVID deaths many would cause virus fell radar. Worst case 300000 mark could end September. 

Sure preventive actions isolating wearing masks see statistics know certain number new daily diagnosed cases means figure approximate future death rate month later. 

But nothing, absolute nothing prevent deaths already late. 

This absolutely gut wrenching horrible! anyone believes hiding underneath beds solution covid delusional course virus make come back second strict measures taken away. difference mortality rate. long keep vulnerable safe, epidemic, specially summer, easily handled. vaccine approved October best case. Take least 3 months vaccinate even 10% population. major vaccination occur year. facts.  yes. cool. Sign up. I'm bored episode skip alien invasion already  people called hypocrite moving Tennessee North Dakota May yet symptoms, quarantined 2 weeks starting job. 2 weeks leaving damn house. People need quit self-centered.  It’s pay go, number workers per retiree unsustainable continues go down. Ignorant bunch assholes. Thats call too. work around compensate limitations, everyone works system does. ""Epic problem"" heard quite often work. remember first grade teacher teaching us word doesnt like, ""death"", mustve poignant moment since thats pretty much remember class. imagine happening pretty much every day Lots used bike sales coming up. infection rates go due vaccine due another factor you’re aware real here: *no* regions infection rate dropped nothing. 

Not even Florida? helped sleep. Two acetaminophen. Thank you, aware ""feel"" want, appreciate sentiment. 
I never tried change facts, promoted reading studies data. Thanks advice. slow joe Imagine growing thinking may killed teacher. dumb. concerned life go strike quit .

Journalism used be. probably never was. way. /s Feel confident.

We know leading candidates moment stimulate antibody response, they're testing see translates actual immunity. 

If Russian vaccine stimulates antibodies creates functional level immunity, presumably feel quite positive least one candidates work. kindergartener licked bus stalls see cringe. 

He also ensured every virus floated remotely near school.. came home. Fourteen healthy days ten weeks school.

Most people going fucking blown away realize germy little Johnny really is.  state wrong. 300,000 Wisconsin alone? half entire United States. 😉👉👉 Nobody likes need get Dr Alien DNA / Demon Semen payroll quick clear up. that's done teach kids Sex Ed


Get doctor indoctrinate kids wacka-doodle Big City / West Coast ideas. dictator video game-like control country, id create national registry reputable babysitters pay take care kids working parents cant home. course thats fantasy despite summer figure out, govt moved turtles pace decided absolutely nothing instead test faith reason means least 9 probably infectious time picture. Jesus. It’s good. It’s right wear mask! Sure don’t come whining government money economy gets shut down. 

That’s socialism all.  consider many students staff (not mention family members) 9 students close contact with.

Have charge forgotten meaning exponential growth? Shut schools now!!

It insanity ever opened begin with. Virologists epidemiologists predicting months, anyone surprised? like administrators thinking ""hey, maybe we'll get lucky virus 'multiply' thing viruses do!"" madness. sleeping Let’s see makes sense: 

Bob works real estate. happens caught disease brother BBQ family. dies. read suddenly say “OMG, hope real estate offices close Bob caught BBQ might later caught client work!” 

You think logical argument? not, suddenly become logical substitute job Bob work? 

If you’re arguing schools close transmissions high given density hundreds kids staff, would sensible argument. Fine. that’s argument. You’re using one example death make incredibly prescient genius-level observation people whose job happens education capable dying. I'm confident health plan least good available school administrators want addicted work? Eww Yeah. want see someone really get shut search Fox news time someone suggests adopt first world healthcare system. friend mine went get test done think may it, mean time still going social events, outdoor activities, restaurants, etc. He's feeling better think it. 

Question: guidance people awaiting test results? Concerned could get trouble.. Region case number comes little play here. know area there’s one two people keeping kids home completely online school option local district didn’t offer “all (at school) bust”. However area one known case beginning April. Nothing else summer despite massive (300-800 people) gatherings on. 

People comfortable risk “hey magic unicorns! It’s real!” Even local health officer supports kids going school “economics mental health”. 

The area around us slowly seen rising numbers, Sturgis passing it’s going interesting see two weeks happens. School starts week. That's...actually good question. Would recently vaccinated plasma work like convalescent plasma? Might even better, pans like think might vaccine stimulates even stronger antibody response? 

That would really interesting. continue cases start rolling vaccines, might really improve plasma treatment supply indeed shown effective treatment. literally something happens time higher parents stupidly afraid take kids doc.

Of course voted sub covid literally responsible everything including global climate change. would surrounding Portland area sure. First class 1000 people unheard elite universities thats already major outlier. Furthermore, TA student meant close touch professor ensure course runs smoothly. entire argument makes sense. State officials also failed promptly renew certificate halted flow data Quest labs around time, meaning another delay information.

Sys Admin needs demoted. 101 level bullshit. Possible, think unlikely. That’s pretty rare outcome athletes top condition. don’t see risk illness potential death. worth it. people know took kids vacations. issues described different colleges &amp; common areas also unusable pandemic. life pandemic. lose something time. noticed even non-work Zoom calls feel much clinical &amp; appointment-like vs pre-COVID interaction college 'third place'. Still early say. marathon. Still 18- 30 months go. far health results look terrible Sweden, cases deaths many times neighbors. wait next round. Second waves Europe, economic damage. far seems Swedish economy slightly better neighborhood, much. personal opinion far: bad experiment, many deaths. Let’s see comes next Username checks Sat ad see nurse. mom. Home done covid tests bad big cats get 'rona, too. Whatever gives good feels. part don’t get. people see this?

Of course see this. think kids home == parents able work == bad economy == less election bribes companies.

Its even greedy ass politicians CEO's (fuck Elon Musk btw) also lot parents glad schools open even money pay bills chance dying. can't breathe without ventilator death comes quick Excess death rates show another 200 thousand dead whole school get it. Unless testing everyone daily What? Omg that’s awesome!!!!!!! No.

What I'm saying media telling everyone majority Americans unemployed broke. know friend wife, got laid server job restaurant. 36, ""still college"". starts collection nearly $900 week unemployment. social media upfront every day new shit bought. Apple products, Nintendo Switch, games, Whole Foods deliveries, gourmet wine crate boxes, $70 cat toys, etc. parlaying benefits lost last week woe routine world ended.  Bottom line is, people saving time spending. Im posting public discussion forum raise awareness critical public health issue - that’s whole purpose daily comment section - engage rational discourse? kind testing happening picture? masks anyone, gloves, swap gets shoved nose swirled around cough. test positive? Guess what? nurse doctor volunteer whatever exposed likely infected. Bunch selfish morons. Cancel damn season already, god. Perfect, I’ll get mine sooner Thank you! Seems like person issue then. suggestion kind fix early 1970s, 1983, 1990s. none fixed problem. surplus would ensured survival program least another generation. generation voted politicians took money - ones responsible dealing it. think it’s bs close relative mine positive near proximity us knew caught informed happened quickly self quarantined took test came negative. makes think easy really catch superb parable indeed. Thanks bringing loop Nice. Yeah would think, someone brilliant could pulled great conspiracy world, could found better candidate Biden. I'm impressed knowing TRIPLETS going microbiology forged incredible career time.

I two kids days dishes raising functional humans time feels difficult.  So, practically immune, right? don’t know ones exposed quarantine? Really? crazy. trying get everybody sick time rationale? states close contacts must quarantine. guess Ga. like credible source references report American Academy Pediatrics can’t find anywhere online. anybody link original report? base decision making. England published recently every three Corona related deaths, two additional deaths reasons.

As mentioned drheretorant, Italy lost years per Corona fatality. expect England's collateral damage low. Plus, final number made years come. welcoming *someone else* refute post. trust novel zoonotic coronavirus. *very* nasty. 7 months little time science medicine get full understanding pandemic illness *isn't* influenza.

'I never thought leopards would eat face,' sobs woman voted Leopards Eating People's Faces Party.

Anytime someone sad experiencing consequences something voted for. know fact every school district country gotten rid effectively communicated that? areas local law, school policy, I'd love proof that. right treated daycare. parents though. reason politicians want schools open parents go back work. need accept young people, old people, poor people equally disposable them. Oh fucks sake. High five? Dallas Fort Worth area. Multiple colleges high schools high quality fields plus cowboys stadium full fledged practice facility. could work. /Face-mask-tracker.secret
LOL Thank you. good information know. adults infect? Also, death rate isn’t whole picture. many survive long term illness due Covid? many take hospital bed weeks/months time? Hundreds new contestants next Darwin Awards. blows away come this. It’s really depressing little America cares virus infecting killing thousands every day. willingly put future generations risk sending back school really shows far deep end country fallen.

I’ve never ashamed American. We're fucked people feel like celebrating we're 55,000 new cases day. Try stay southern part Maine can. northern tends toward conservative, mindless support orange one (god knows why... He's done nothing them) plenty Covid conspiracy theorists running around. However--when leadership strong, people eventually needs doing. love local stores require (and enforce) masks. What's nice lots cottage industries, buy real food real farmers. Best luck move. I've lived many places across globe, Maine still favorite. title misleading. led believe Gates saying something completely different actually saying.

I thinking would violently respectfully disagree Gates. actually read opinion, complete agreement.

We compensate high 24 hour turnaround, standard 48 hour turnaround, longer turnaround. enough alleviate symptoms? *... expecting many students get bus — 35% children area expected learn remotely.*

The problem kids impoverished rural neighborhoods going crowded onto buses broadband computers home, remote learning option. Well, stupid stupid does. Yeah yeah dumb evil genius. Always remember: (almost) free, product. Google gives free search engine gmail, gets data.

Tracker chip confirmed. ""patriots"" feel individual rights women want choose reproductive options? gays want get married? bad hosts push back that. There's evidence, based past, would see mass starvation death enter depression. great depression life expectancy actually went up.  another local, ditto! political administration owns numbers never allow reported numbers reach high. likely even allow officially reported number climb 200k. Yeah, personally think school going crank volume lot anyone expecting. we're counting December, turkey day gatherings holiday shopping trips take toll. Plus whatever bonehead moves revered leaders make; still loads states communities mask policies, silly half measures. fuck coronavirus real made china scare people! Nothing happen. happening. feel like Americans counted refugees last four years, definitely since March. life risk *willing take* ensure theirs.  nope testing way even hurricane shutdowns

they testing weeks close 100k day went two weeks barely 50k day hurricane shutdown cratered numbers even more.
it artificial dip fooled people I'm sure I'm super wooshing sarcasm actually crimson party member....but ho boy cannot stand ""masks = scared"" line floating around there.

God ever grind gears. still get paid. first thing noticed too. Totally unacceptable let room without proper equipment. Think break news kids looked guy - reopening schools create many situations these

(Yes know, didnt get school, foolish think teachers staff completely safe schools reopen) fuck coronavirus real made china scare people! dumbo, mean poor aren’t paying you. don’t give shit people obviously. Everyone different, similar mine It’s definitely sad moment Nation’s history. Moderate sized county 24 people coincidentally die month positive COVID coroner interprets mean COVID killing people. 

This guy must great investigating causes death. He's like Dr. House, sorta knows even starts. fuck coronavirus real made china scare people! classic also gave unemployed $400 week state unemployment. get ""we echo chamber side idiots"" spirit. real world regular people drifting right left trying figure out. 

I'm farming upvotes here. good article big deal. think people know lot stories going around. farts smell bad others'. people charge school district probably predicted decided go virtual only. title really poorly worded. read think one person go 20 citations. 

I needed know could happen... know didn't.

Yes please enforce mask mandates, also find one person refused wear mask hand 20 citations. feel like it'll long time Corona us? Ugghh... thanks response. Guaranteed fuckwits test limits every single vaccine comes market simply getting them, causing outbreaks.

Oh, ""data"" we'll have.... No, that's one thing never done since started whatever reason. Mask wearing using hand sanitizer since March, never washing groceries [Federal appeals court sides Cape Elizabeth High School student free speech said? ... g-good news? gives unemployed $400 week states give. gives working people temporary 6.5% tax break. extends Student Loan Deferments. 

And answer ? Really ? Congress done ? Nothing. 

BTW, authority. US National Emergency. remember Pelosi crew insisted upon leverage debt first COVID relief efforts. 

If don’t like authority Executive National Emergency, talk Pelosi - idea. doesnt.

The Bill Melinda Gates Foundation spends money, makes it. Bet really classy woman man lost 100 pounds going gym once! Ok? shown mass gatherings open public spaces spread virus, what's big deal? Wrong. 54k estimated top 160k addition teachers, think break news kids. 

I really looked many teachers, even one die (or even hospitalized), would unimagineably traumatic experience Lombardy. hope proven wrong then. region enough corona already. never forget moment saw pictures army trucks Bergamo. got disconnected surprised this? also doesn’t make kind education, class, empathy brains. tell virus interference vaccination varied individual respiratory viruses.'

With words, bet. sicko types word document parents basement creates youtube video flashing lights ppl get sucked in.

I'm eugenics.

Can't wait vaccine. hopefully return somr semblance life realize idea impacts virus recover right? recent study found 55% people still brain issues recovering virus 

This doesn’t hurt old people, everyone risk life ruining ailments recovering (most people seems) even super villain would think shit.. believe first, try find justifications beliefs, always succeed. Many history smoking, drinking, substance abuse. ""But people aren’t getting tests back quickly enough.
Well, that’s stupidity. majority US tests completely garbage, wasted. don’t care late date reimburse level, course they’re going take every customer. making ridiculous money, it’s mostly rich people getting access that. reimbursement system pay little bit extra 24 hours, pay normal fee 48 hours, pay nothing [if isn’t done then]. fix overnight.""





What actually said. turnaround time efficacy. couple pic exactly expected people look like. think go home states spread it. undeniably many accidental deaths happen lockdowns. argument extra deaths happened hospitals panicked greater number. there's evidence either way. I'm shocked Facebook page spiritual coaching whatever fuck still up. Like publicly posts phone number email whatnot. profits vaccines, God bless greed collapsing. Turning Brazil. Rich people living enclosed communities, masses poors. What's American word favela? True, NZ done better lot countries there, fact people can’t illegally cross border makes lot easier contain. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Oh, well! like could done anything it! two children die week Florida, think parents feel that? really easy? Lmao I'm saying unintuitive way read things interested hard numbers vs. growth rates. Brazil 80,000 110,000? UK 30,000 70,000? guess could divide section interval smaller sections approximate log functions determine reference points, linear scale easy look intervals approximate distance between. fellow teacher explain kids won’t transmit much adults shorter breathing level/space adults. means well super sweet, sort sit stare space disengage. West Coast first infected primarily Chinese Chinese Americans. whole Asian community started wearing masks taking precautions early. substantial behavioral differences traveled Asia vs traveled Europe (the latter didn’t feel risk). Much Luv doubt average Strugis-goer much education. I’m explaining inheritance probate work. someone dies estate goes probate, debts must paid assets delivered anyone will. house probate complete. Sounds like asset pay medical debts, needs sold pay debts. she’s truly receive house, get remainder proceeds sale house payment debts. right remain house law. “squatter”. 

Anyway, feel badly her. guess lived MIL died kept living there, like anyone would do. probate law clear MIL died debts. estate must pay debts.

No reason get mad me. I’m explaining situation based fact article said house part probate MILs estate. Ahhh, anus America Thank clarifying that. wondering exact role challenge trials was. basically, challenge trials show vaccine ineffective need move phase 3 trials. I’m south. ethical develop vaccine covid even know potential solution ? Or, ethical allow people use vaccine tested efficacy ? feel uneased vaccine developments. feel like rushed reminds rushed meal uncooked meat gives diarrhea lol guy gives unemployed $400 week state gives employed people get 6.5% tax break. 

Your answer no. 

WTF ? Sweden basically excuse par hardest hit. advantages Nordic countries squandered it. No, they're going bad Mexico Ecuador, society, quality governmental pandemic choices.

There joke Nordic countries can't wait over, return 2m social distancing guidelines typical 3m. Mississippi always tries one Alabama dumbest state. Trump went Wharton. People fucking clue they're talking about.

Piece-rate insanely profitable good job. work meat-processing plant Toronto area. senior employees paid per pound make 6 figures. uneducated Chinese employees barely speak English. make double median income simply they're good chopping chicken. Que? Like every vaccine shit something goes wrong maker safe Goal post moved again. Good continue happen. fact point. guy contract education, shows somehow immune like seem believe. want open schools current pandemic you, whether say loud not, acceptable number deaths ok with. 

The two teachers high school impactful life 60, retired former professionals got teaching help pass experience. teachers school 45. Idk thinks people going fine exposed hundreds kids day, we're going collectively lose lot valuable education experience. Yep, ranges way go. Picking specific number misleading best harmful worst. Better give range realistic outcomes become billionaires WRITING checks. Lots lockdown related deaths too, secondarily related Covid. Agreed long haulers still going majority people mild cases would seen something Nah, see country spent way long thinking knee wall restaurant able keep cigarette smoke one side uncontaminated air other. could physically see smoke. people saying masks aren’t mandatory school long kids stay 3 feet apart (like governor state) aren’t concerned spread like that. rights freedoms even issue smart people tell us do. personally responsible respectful beginning now, fighting freedoms stupid selfish. Like little children told what's right. agree,especially since promised(?) vaccine Election Day recently. 30,000 people clinical trials enough establish effectiveness tracking trials gets infected (or doesn't) normal course events? comparing results vaccinated people average rate infection public? almost vaccinated people get infected, 1.5% average people (or non-vaccinated half clinical trail members) get infected, proper effective way this? 

I've assuming that's things always work, missed something? Thank you. know people convinced hospitals bribing people get money.... Also easier John McClane impression drop bottle shower! We're officially bargaining stage pandemic 

Going 

Hey look deaths. There's barely deaths. 

To

It's old people gonna die anyways. Depends count. covid death count per million less US. Instead looking excess mortality Sweden catches every single death adjust real number due parallell reporting systems top article sub states 200700/328=631 deaths/million US basing excess mortality. already exceeds Sweden currently 570 deaths/million.

The paralell reporting systems Sweden due deaths need reported tax agency next working day. public health agency cross checks people tested positive last 30 days. 

The real cause death needs reported doctor 2 weeks official statistic end year. Abbott test linked, video kind vague, look like rapid PCR test. rapid antigen rapid PCR tests. articles I've seen previous poster, kind assumed ""rapid test"" mentioned antigen (serology) test, since ones potentially super cheap (like, $1 testing bounced around) super easy administer. 

In either case, rapid testing prone false positives false negatives. That's sort nature beast. 

EDIT: removed asterixes I'm bad reddit italicized everything. Notes below. 

I might coming pretentious asshole here, scientist, news articles customer-facing test press releases vague useless someone trying get details actual test performed. info rapid Abbott test (including specificity/sensitivity) I'd love see it. 

OK, so, ""serology"" test simply means human serum tested (I'm explaining others, necessarily you, please offended). context COVID-19, means get serology test either antigen antibody test. 

A positive ANTIBODY test means COVID-19 long enough (and ""bad"" enough) generate immune response.

A positive ANTIGEN test means viral product system CURRENTLY. closer PCR test, susceptible false never heard communicated Trump. 

LOL I'm sure he'd even count serologic tests 50m+ tests done right?

You shouldn't. Especially antibody tests. serological tests susceptible high false positives (especially compared PCR test). states report though, May 2020. bet did. prisoners dissidents. Sounds like government! best way mess viable vaccine becomes widely deployed. everyone could test entering public spaces, like schools restaurants, life could get back semi-normal.

In Germany classes full. half attend means go every second day. Also different classes go pause time. Idk what's hard report updated every 10 days recent one available location: excel sheet contain numbers since start also available continuously (current link - )

The report short, Figure 1 shows evolution incidences infection splits confirmed local imported infection. Table 1 lists recent (for 20-30/7) estimations Rt Figure 2 shows fit longer graph. Rest report covers data used, method estimated references scientific sources.

\------------------

In previous report (which described link longer valid) 13-23/7 Rt dropped 0.66 median values starting show uptick - entire period ranged 0.66-0.84 increase end period.

In new report shown increase overall continued - values 20-30/7 ranging 0.77-0.91 median values period increase end potentialy going 1.00 97.5% quantile estimation. excel sheet visible first time since 11/6 higher range estimate going 1.00 Rt.

Talk people make less benefits. May eye opening. Yeah feel like skews lower college kids January? majority world even know Corona virus then. r/Coronavirus short trip. International flights sometimes 18-30 hours, 50 hours exceptionally long time. info article, author trying imply something. I'm trying break cruft, talk science. I'm curious know thoughts points:

1) trials either specify HCQ administered administered late. administered 2 days, HCQ would relatively ineffective. example, ""Hydroxychloroquine Nonhospitalized Adults Early COVID-19: Randomized Trial"" undetermined time 5 days administering HCQ treatment. there's narrow window HCQ work, possible studies simply administering treatment quickly enough show efficacy.

2) HCQ zinc ionophore, order effective, HCQ must taken zinc. However, see studies indicate zinc also administered HCQ. could crucial factor.

3) dosages 600-800 mg used studies high dosages (as must effective post-exposure). So, arrhythmia concerns valid.

If HCQ shown effective per #1 (or combination #1 #2), kind begs question HCQ used pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP), could available OTC. dosages PrEP reduced 200mg, standard dosage. would help alleviate #3.

Obviously, logistical issues administering treatment quickly, issues weaknesses RCT studies presented might hiding true results HCQ's efficacy limiting research HCQ PrEP? fucking stupid. could happen? careful there's one thing pandemic highlighted, stupidity human race. know movies aliens come invade earth fend fighting? they're watching, know need that.

All need sort highly infectious virus infect handful people. rest human race what's required wipe itself. aliens come take without fight. Zero energy wasted. 

Humans, wear fucking mask protect others yourselves. dicks it. biased source. Click history. Reporting. 200K including 165K ""official"" number. excess 50K deaths cannot explained. Underreporting coronavirus. can’t even remember 19. He’ll alright, better keep us safe reducing travel. wear mask, using minecraft several online public schools, K12 Online teaching way long pandemic.

Science rooted facts. roll w anti-intellectual bullshit cause good ratings power. known use rabbit head gang logo, symbolically representing name co-founder, *The Rabbit*.

The gang usually found near Venal, though sightings even relatively high security areas high police presence. 54.700 excessive deaths compared 2019.

No national lockdown, brief state city-wide lockdowns there. mostly uncoordinated quarantines local authorities, federal gov't working really hard push ""open everything"" narrative openly fought social isolation efforts.

Each state also used different parameters metrics ease tight quarantine measures (some show, others serious social distancing intents). without organized effort, federal gov't working hard push stupid political narrative, people got increasingly confused frustrated long wait. bought official idea ""this dangerous media says"", ""we get thing one way another live life"". all, many.

Combine fact president fired two Health Ministers pandemic following medical consensus (we temporary Health Minister months now) result tragic death toll mentioned here. adult leadership = deaths. like comment. statements true. god would’ve thought??? admins fired least prosecuted willful endangerment. Fucking morons That's already happening influenza common cold.

Well that's mainly two things: 1) Portland's populace supports actions protests. 2) protests happen approximately 2% land area Portland, centered district comprised federal police buildings, housing business. always upvote anyone makes go learn something interesting. say that? think I’ll listen newspaper founded 1845 one countries respond adequately first wave virus.

Maybe need little dramatic reaction response. phase 3 trial collect live data infections:? Poor Larry. amount teachers work, might be. Pool 10 - 15 families hire work teacher you’re pretty set. teacher making $40/hr = $4/hr less per family (assuming it’s one kid per family). 

That’s quite affordable honestly, kids getting 1 1 education would normally. alive US sucks lol Fuck want Windows XP back Still doesnt explain idea sweden somehow escape second surge neigbours wont Really depends occupation person, need outside meet people feed family getting vaccine immediately. Otherwise going continue self isolating see vaccines truely safe They're Yolo mode 
...you live mode....hmm Wikipedia: “ Straits Times English-language daily broadsheet newspaper based Singapore ... established 15 July 1845”

It action. Singapore based news outlet objective fact educated are, likely politically liberal. parents fit parents, truly good people minority. Yes, estimation. That's point. know. Several numbers suspected. lot countries like Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand parts Europe successfully control rise first wave infections. use time lockdown prepare control next round infections.

On spectrum, countries diseases prevention measures like border closures lockdowns, failed additional time prepare enough preparation like America, Philippines, South Africa, India parts Latin America. fuelling large sum new cases see worldwide. Oxford vaccine originally MERs vaccine, tested Saudi Arabia 2 3 years ago. passed combined phase 1/2 trials 1000s participants worst side effect sore arm fever (which get annual flu jabs). state in? difference calico meowmeow tortoiseshell calicos white colors torys not. raids rise simple that, deaths one Australian state, rest Australia covid control. like 17 deaths 7M One key also amount non native people living country. Finnish Swedes good social distance. Sweden 19.6% residents born outside sweden. finland 7,3%.
Thats 2 000 000 vs 300 000.

In sweden got big spread suburbans stockholm. Areas lot immigrants, cultures less social distancing. you’re genuinely colour blind lmao 20-40%

And dont post national review want taken seriously.

I dont post dailybeast you.

You still havent answered question lot viral disease damage causes virus itself, impropel response immune system corticosteroids actually good.


At end day asking doctor correct move. America thank reality show .. stop   Ah, classic name calling. support argument bud. coronavirus big deal, Trump able squash out? Genuine question—if believe he's telling truth, he's President republican control Congress, exposed truth? guy, there's time wake reality. solveable coordinated planning tho (which shockingly spend last 5 months doing)... 

First all, kids left alone fairly young. norm days, done teaching. started staying home alone around 8. 

Okay know that's going fly helicopter parents days, lets call around 12 years old kids left without much concern. they'll expected tuned web classes teachers/parents keep tabs day.

Employers also give employees mid-day break go check kids. 

So that's really Kindergarten 5th/6th grade concern here. 

One possible solution ""house pooling"". Split younger kids smaller groups 5-6. Ask parents volunteer hosts (or assign state-paid aides). much...just make sure kids logged distance learning. 

Itd big undertaking impossible. Let’s hope didn’t create super virus. Ugh. parents take sort serious still issues. family gathering grandmother’s 90th birthday. said would come due large group (30 people probably distancing). mother ‘but everyone comes one missing it’. Yup, exactly don’t go.. Even grandmother seems sort okay chance making 91. Can’t get understand okay that.. so? least live deaths kids much severe conditions (normally organ transplant). 70% estimation. five minutes spare, look quote Shakespeare's ""The merchant Venice"", commentary : Social studies, useless class school. USA needs STEM, artists, trade-school jobs.  bullshit, rose-tinted history USA. children accused Joe rape? 6 accused Trump dating back years. Joe videos look creepy, allegations rape, all. Unsure one pedophile fucking kids. son tested cvs never got test result back. 3 weeks later... nothing. Biggest worry vaccine horribly ineffective major side effects. dissuade individuals ever using real effective ones time comes. don’t know anyone replied this, lace code mostly thing punk community specifically combat boots, least know. Yes that’s people social distancing wearing masks. It’s practical hive older folks rest world others advocated. can't extrapolate 78% all. seems prevalent people COVID-19 extrapolating 3 4 people scientific. skip lol Yes right. think good get test nonetheless family home. keeping count, that's 30,000,000 million infected, least.

That's lot potential life-long health issues survivors.  want freedom consequence themselves. want freedom oppress others. could enforced mask wearing.

or social distancing Okay I've seen bunch ""designer"" ""custom"" masks sold internet. One said this

""This Face Covering personal use intended medical purpose replacement medical grade personal protective equipment. fashion face covering intended personal protective equipment used healthcare professionals used healthcare/clinical environment setting. face covering intended prevent protect form illness disease (or otherwise).""

So literally nothing all? would anyone buy then? bitter education, anything, typing like fucking child suggests one bitter education. advanced topics, fucking chemistry 101, big name professors something offer lecture office hours (are forgetting those?). taken classes world’s leading professors mathematics, CS, definitely offer lot terms teaching. Forexample, presented alternative insightful proofs won’t see standard textbook.

Sure, professors hate teaching process especially lower level classes like fucking chemistry 101, higher level classes definitely want learn someone helped advance field significantly. 

TLDR: shitting CC’s around amazing professors definitely eye opening experience.

I sorry experience shit, clearly bitter something. Probably avoid 200 dollar bill delivery free vaccine. Hasn’t anyone considered using Clorox clean insides instead waiting vaccine?!?!? “Likely”? Yeah, schools Europe outbreaks schools entire society crushed spread. America one giant hotspot. 

Fucking hell man think like 3 seconds comment. Rip grandma gloves serve two purposes. One, clean gloves return car. way clean everything touch car. Two, wearing gloves, clean hands react badly constant cleaning.

My understanding soap breaks outer fatty cell structure virus. outer shell destroyed, virus longer viable. wash gloves/hands thoroughly whatever rubbed towel contagious virus. People reject good news fake news  community college idiots.

I’ve found many professors CCs interested actually teaching. went “top” engineering college many professors renowned researchers. Unfortunately, large chunk clue lead lecture.

Just know something doesn’t mean automatically know teach it.  4 parks cutting hours total 5 hrs ""drastically""?

It’s working well. countries using it, too. Seeing mortality rate ~.7%, LOLzed! (1) that’s weird thing imply fine

(2) official communication said don’t come back. Kids could travel easily campus luxury able come back try take stuff, penns official word don’t come back. yea, didn’t let get stuff, kids lucky

(3) places like radian make statements saying penn tell landlords push kids out?

(4) penn great getting students emergency housing, massive spread sheets going around help people else go find peers rooms/couches storage? kids saying denied scrambling housing penn great handles it?

(5) must thinking opinion pieces DP, don’t think it’s fair say DP whole “quotes whiners”. really don’t know half kids go though. example, I’m longer student close enough: could move home, I’d subjected emotional abuse toxic home environment. enough warrant legal action. enough would “choose” stay campus vs quarantined hellish family

(6) okay...bro. Can’t handle “bad” language internet? Maybe it’s time log then...for good. Well, depending from, may truth ‼️

However, response original comment, we're talking college kid USA. really wanted move country, position... I'm sure would lot easier so, lot people, especially countries, attempting relocate USA. 

Sounds like someone needs little staycation good smoke 💨💨💨 Shedep slaves would say dead middle, maybe little since live Wyoming pay bit lower cost living also lower. I've got 3 kids, 2 dogs, cat, wife combined bring $90k year. That's real problem lot this, unfortunately.

Eventually, goes ""We need fix disease"", ""it's fixing it, need get back work"", ""If get COVID, there's 5% chance die 95% chance live. work COVID, go bankrupt, homeless- do, there's 100% chance starve death."" simply true many levels, ridiculous. dont magically become ""online-able"" turned 18 That's understandable. ones find way need too. least limit amount children schools. Like high school students instance stay home alone. understand leaving 6 7 year olds alone 6 year old would disaster. hire babysitter possible even would better sending crowded school. 9 found. doubt far infected showing yet. 1) don’t think one. isn’t one SARS.

2) one, many negative actors attempting rush, shortcut, profit countless people won’t trust it. Maybe capitalistic side cause founder one powerful companies world wealth tied business well. free sell stock wants without reducing power company longer runs.

I admit 2019 Raid Area 51 movement funny. Repeating lie makes part problem.

That depends lie used within confines news article. others stated, editorializing fact cause shift perceived biases. fact, according Media Bias Fact Check, Guardian [left center bias, mixed facts good place start, really.

I'm journalist, expert matter. I'm dude rapidly approaching 40, who's shifted careers 20+ years customer service world media via film, acting, broadcast, podcasts, etc., I've smattering training regarding journalistic integrity. although I'm PoppinKREAM et. al, I've learned thing two people's brains work, approach respectable news source.

First foremost, best weapon lies, truth. includes truth lie. Quoting word word tweet rally statement lends credibility integrity. One cannot validly proclaim bias ""fake news"" literally repeating claimed. They'll it, claims potential credibility. course, truth demolish lie early stages, we've seen time again. needs happen effectively *bury* lie truth.

One known ""burying lede"" (this many interpretations, take perspective gospel). Here, get attention reader information truthful and/or contrary lie *before* quoting lie. construct truth *around foundation* lie, casually quote lie, continue focusing truth, lie effectively becomes buried. helps lie inflammatory controversial, redundant, know. Also, make title lie, make first paragraph it. **angle** focus [angle thing things article largely going talking about, like USPS's function, instance].

What one bring focus lie, attempt make article focused effort discrediting lie, truth no. looks sounds like assault someone's words...perhaps, even attack speech. least, that's believe lie perceive it. Approaching sense combativeness get ""fake news"" label quickly.

For me, personally, prefer use various sources fit [MBFC's ""Pro Science"" and/or ""Least Biased"". do? Sometimes, depends mood. Maybe care enough super thorough. days, however, prefer moreso. Human brains, Report lie happened without letting liar use spread misinformation.

Couldn't agree more. I’m glad done people sure. Personally consolidated well went ridiculous interest rates lot loans. Much lower rate now, since private don’t deferment. like said commend actions taken stop interest accruing government held loans. Social distancing compute schools. regular vaccine takes couple years get onto market. covid vaccine going rushed testing process, mention political pressure FDA approve something, anything, resembles vaccine. 

It perfectly ok question rushed covid vaccine. let pro-vaccination people bully anyone taking rushed covid vaccine. trust safe enough, efficacy? knows, im willing take find out. listen interviews sometimes podcasts, I've never seen him.  slurs much audio could swear shit wasted like lunch time.  need watch see.

What fucking surprise. That's nice. union representing 4,000 teachers locally said thing district like, ""Yeah, hear concerns, also give shit"" UNMC recommended maximum amount positive cases per day 14.5 city reopen schools they're currently 2-3x right now. 

School starts Wednesday, 100% person unless parents opt remote. going shitshow. problem is, real life literally yolo mode. get one chance, fucked ends cought corona 3rd period social studies teacher Definitely satire. yes, die hard loyalists days.  Maybe think suspending students help distancing. Currently US, roughly 5 million confirmed cases 162k deaths 3.5% mortality. However, numbers based cases deaths, 5 million cases outcome, compare cases outcome cases deaths, death rate actually higher.

.05 mortality quite low. example yes, half one chip 100 would .05 we’re talking 3.5 100 based current numbers. hope students school visit local school board trustees, person, loudly demand answers. Really scream. Maybe even drool little. numbers article. Try again. said children infected enough close schools, yet say know everyone else? Everyone else reason! That's happens overspend greed capitalism. Plenty money fix this, that's gonna happen. way America running right now, even fauci approved - I'd still take vaccine least months public release working population number immune system. Indian here. We've opened everything schools colleges like open anytime soon They're usually trained get protection. also fairly well understood die saving people burning building. lab rat. refuse. Definitely agree! priority comes schools. I’m sure district specifically, someone larger district schools say all, although outcry teachers union heavy influence. I’d say comes back state. Brian Kemp next level piece shit I'm custodian hospital right ton jobs open every position hospital many people retired. make sure little sister get's vaccine? doubt enough doses everyone right bat. prioritized ""At-Risk"" categories?

We loved ones at-risk. really care making sure get sick. want go first. I'm risk, work home, wear mask anywhere go, I've full OCD germophobe since January (before even hit Italy). 

But want wait Phase IV (post-market) completed. safety surveillance designed detect rare long-term adverse effects much larger patient population longer time period possible Phase I-III clinical important society whole risk take vaccine that's completed Phase IV study, yeah, I'll get one. till though, thank you. Especially given rushed previous phases been. Dude person responding enemy source pain. government completely failing us fucking disproportionately. fact suffering invalidate others suffering, though. sounds like delt pretty shitty hand, need remember real enemy here, government. virus killing wrong people! Senator Rand Paul it. Boris Johnson it. Burundi president Ayatollah Iran died it. Unless Trump dies it, think going make difference. literally saw five kids grocery today, seems less common maybe significantly less, area least Even shutting confirmed positive case waaaay late considering long one carry virus contagious displaying symptoms. theres point giving sources since science wont convince you. good day comrade protein used virus enter cells ACE2 involved regulation angiotensin system, involved among things blood pressure regulation. wonder blasting bunch cells bear ACE2 existence effects blood pressure, goes back normal organs heal... I've thinking awhile every child parent home.

I can't say percentage parents essential workers....so leave kids with? School become sort daycare dual income homes.

Some parents unemployment...and capable big telecommuting...but all... 1).There vaccine first SARS virus virus seemingly disappeared vaccine studies advanced.

2). I'm confident progress Oxford vaccine. They're institution would least likely politically/financially motivated rush vaccine development summer????? * INSERT PIKACHU SHOCKED FACE MEME*  Fair point. Getting serious Ken flashbacks Welcome capitalism. profit human lives. I've taken vaccines since day one. Nothing yet mate. stfu. wish cancer anyone Whenever see someone posting FB ""social distancing permanent, even pandemic,"" get really angry -- point I'm almost nauseous. think time cut social media even further... positive cases time, mean people virus. dude extra shitty. Went rant social media like fucking child. superintendent/this administration legitimately needs sent jail kids families get sick, I’m sure Thats standard actually kids Fed that! Wtf! gun pointed heads. That's hilarious! :D

But ya....it way ever anywhere.

But can't teach kind dumb.  shouldn’t diminish another person’s personal struggles subjectively feel worse. struggling various ways since March. pissing contest type attitude fucking sucks.

Alabama testing 5x Japan, I'd bet 95% tests wasted slow results little follow-up. MASK tAkEs aWaY fReEdOm! Gotta make sure able attend coronation. Atleast help Vaccine trials. Reddit science best. “Simulation” equals “broad assumption”, therefore study worthless. found line quoted interesting, shared source. every Reddit comment needs book, we’d never anything else.

Influenza infections easy spread kids actually get sick symptomatic spread outrageously contagious proven devastating public health every flu season. “Less effective” necessarily mean “not effective”. don’t get degree “lesser”, less crazy high number influenza (maybe incorrectly) deemed appropriate risk, isn’t terribly helpful guidance.

The quote shared certainly misleading neither contradictory conclusion study. know right dealt right way start wouldnt bad 23 actually think Covid 19 last 4 months. exactly I’m talking about! *sigh*prised Pikachu fffaaaaaace

agaaain far discipline such... us* pisses people selfish stupid. also American. feel part problem lot issues throwing fit many people slaves jobs there's time go protest still able pay bills healthcare. kids becomes even complicated. want make better voting corrupt elections sure else turn. mean... cant really ban protesting so. recommend YouTube r/sewing - lots good tips both!! Quebecers American Canadians still open spaces wear masks, find picture without masks, like said, group without masks see, know many can't see wear masks. ""Kids getting infected much fine""

Well yeah maybe wernt anything absolutely believe we've under-counting cases, seems pretty extreme. sources it? Even teacher, nurse, skilled non poor career; seems workout pay insane tuition healthcare balances people. Congrats beating game establishing career, ya mind ask is? cancer watching people die it. 

This absolutely terrifying hope people still catch late. going break many hearts. sounds like Onion article reprinted every mass shooting: “‘No way prevent this’ says nation regularly happens.” province’s government actively trying cut doctors wages billable hours trying prevent leaving another jurisdiction they’re treated like valuable resources are. fucking pandemic. Gotta love Alberta. Minnesota phenomenon. People driving much faster usual roads empty. crashed likely fatal due speed. this??? Oh, mean like humans thousands years, (dealing virus among things) immune system seems help bit?  LOL stop watching Hysterical News Network maybe able think yourself. There's way many people worse me, especially area. I'd probably die guilt overload tbh. reportedly actually?  many colleges, it’s *huge* revenue stream. BLM protests least **some distancing** closed space

If google image ""BLM protest"" see wrong. Australia tracking app cost millions produced grand total zero cases. Checking community spread always done questioning infected check whereabouts. I'll fill rest comment 

 Yes requires close 90% population get infected develop antibodies reach point. would kill millions without knowing long antibodies stay ones system could worst last months although likely years.

 letting millions people dying preferable option wearing mask social distancing? want death toll engraved oval office. want every president forward never forget incompetence cascade into. smart thing would close school. Looking passing period full hallways. American entitlement Could start ""go fund me""? Right believe virus actually hoax it’s actually big deal? Good news based science also fake based conspiracy. news/data says it’s getting better according scientific data, that’s also fake news conspiracy data fake. thing real ”honest” despite data stating otherwise we’re going die vaccine never come holing house “new normal” forever. According reasoning, it’s worst possible news, it’s news trust. 

Some y’all real pieces work. Still could easily another strain flu less likely. plan boofing mine 100% agree. administration rolled dice hoping vaccine September failed trying blaim everyone else themselves.  flu shots made dog kidneys many coronaviruses 👀 setup way that’s start things come think commenter trying point religion teaches us things outside territory verifiability. 

Religion says “here is” can’t disproven proven. accept not-proven truth, may become vulnerable accepting beliefs aren’t rooted objective facts. losing healthcare unemployment. didn’t really answer question. 5 million confirmed positive 162k death gives us 3.5%. said 5 million cases equal 5 million infected, not? getting OSS reporting I’m saying close years, add restrictions. Make schools virtual, work home, laws making people wear masks, contact tracing. It’s difficult countries worldwide done incredibly well. could *believe* use song. next level malignant narc evil. land borders Worker Santa wrote this. don’t think going get fixedly time soon US. hope horizon vaccine fully expect government fail safety testing too. took back time come back school get sick. local school here. contact tracing plan quarantine hard rules happens. kids going every day. plan, useless safety guidelines, What’s point? 

All parents talked CDC (written White House, original CDC guidelines May scrapped) points much kids need school. American pediatrics association said go safe. 

Idiots seriously. groups bending government. It’s obvious goin fail ! I’m glad mom tested negative. 
That’s kind thing I’m afraid family. takes lot emotional maturity self discipline, admit symptoms one’s contacts, deal people unhappy it. many people would keep secret.
I fear sneak-attack hug, relatives (in past) would insisted close contact, kiss cheek too. saw person, would distance half hour, discipline would break down. can’t risk it.
When comes social distancing, Loch Ness Monster role model aspire to. taking snip one paragraph main results didn’t even look data. can’t take one sentence Cochrane review misrepresent authors conclusion. 

Were participants trials good representation population whole? 

What power study? 

Did trials start good hypothesis (were trials set appropriately try hypothesis?). 

I urge learn appropriately evaluate measures look see data collected analyzed properly. 

If profession makes proficient critically reviewing journal articles, may idea, poor job sharing conclusions. Pasting authors conclusion critical review. 

Here’s Main Results: (which last part read journal article, meta-analysis multiple studies otherwise, don’t form bias opinion without critically looking data)


We found 52 clinical trials 80,000 adults. unable determine impact bias 70% included studies due insufficient reporting details. Around 15% included studies well designed conducted. focused reporting results 25 studies looked inactivated vaccines. Injected influenza vaccines probably small protective effect influenza ILI (moderate-certainty evidence), 71 people would need vaccinated avoid one influenza case, 29 would need vaccinated avoid one case ILI. Vaccination may little appreciable effect hospitalisations (low-certainty evidence) number working days lost. better alive. know might mean coming internet stranger. true.  


you can't replace people. can't replace lives. brave resign, necessary.  


Know one door close, another opens. fine. Stay strong.  


Respect. found 9. many showing symptoms, missed. Look data regarding sudden, unnatural increase deaths since beginning pandemic. There's obvious reason many deaths normal year, many tested virus, death something else, primarily pneumonia.

Lots people without tested it, lots people died without tested.

That's data still likely accurate percentage regarding data have. Better false positives cautious rather cluster fuck right now. Anyone willing listen reason vice thinking know better experts. we’re nation full science deniers, ya do? spend $1B chip us we've already chipped (phone, tablet, pc, smart watch)  seems... low. I’m sure America rise above. *facepalm* What, can’t find people already infected? Shit man go Florida School openings going ravage communities mandate masks students.

I'm little concerned too. recently *finally* got chance go barber, shooting shit pandemic affected them. knew barber personally asked kids, (of course) said 'unfair wear mask day, should, like, able take class they're 6 feet apart'.

I friends them, held tongue, man surprised me. wear mask day job, mind you. Everyone inside buildings.

I pray God district tolerance wearing masks. sure clothes. Tax fuck billionaire oligarchy profiting pandemic forcing workers various corporations work unsafe conditions, use tax revenue pay people stay home kids 8 weeks absolutely crush spread virus. Illinois county decided 2.5% rate high person learning. idea dumbasses playing at. already Melbourne australia terribly despite island based. essentislly shut states right Victoria getting locked down.

UK poorly well

Its community transmissions important track.

Then countries like US problem neighbouring nations canada mexico. small country isolated can't compare country's faces

Too late assholes. I'm betting 1M time next June, without vaccine widely available Trump re-elected. Wow know ten people doctors turned away told thing . bandanas. (Schooled one south Florida). I’m sure that’s still enforced corona too.... timeline referring to. Edited initial comment reflect this. 

And thank part trial. contact tracers seem solid job, virtually restrictions. terrifying. don’t (I can’t) believe doctors coroners it.

In current job marked? think would pretty easy pressure people following procedures letter, control procedures get desired numbers. live sweden lot people practice social distancing many streets still crowded. throw Covid parties without strict guidlines many still think situation serious. Can’t tell bit tall people susceptible sarcasm not. not, miss? I’m tall guy you’ve got worried lol  #SAD! saw dude get trouble striped polo once, reason Ridiculous. feel bad kids days. self expression allowed.  


Fuck. me. dumb question, exactly mean X% effective. mean vaccine say 50% effective(the low bar FDA approval) 100 people vaccinated would work 50 people? mean provides 50% (or guess partial since likely cannot immunity percentages like that) immunity 100% people get it? Lol wat. immunology change last months way completely missed? obedience. reverence 
the roughed, salt earth, common sense people yesteryear. This, turn breeds anti-intellectualism sentiment drives people protest masks affront ""freedumbz"". part plan really don’t know cater stupid people. Freedom limited non idiots. mandatory JANUARY. took 8 months smh makes sense. Masks pandemic unjust, bare shoulders threat functioning society MUST covered.... get it. 😬😑 Working Fair Fair ;p That's he's letting virus run rampant, worry elderly anymore... move Considering amount partying years back, I've probably done damage self virus has. take care self try stress less. CCCP astroturfing protest WTF? took long enough amount money resource thrown tests ridiculous. 

I wonder long get tired tested every time student potentially infected. imaging getting all-clear group kids tested one classmates showing symptoms possibly exposed outside school every week. stupid. Try 8 months took bike nice 120 mile round trip yesterday, need interact single person whole time. That's get feeling cooped up. Going biker rally feel cooped up. people ask beliefs others matter. Maybe exist vacuum beliefs inform actions (or lack thereof) (in)actions serious consequences. Yeah, herd immunity won’t happen. lose 100’s thousands lives. Young, old, sick previously heathy! sad terrible leaders funny meme culture still settled name guys. see everyone call ""male Karens"" Thank this. cancelled vacation Shreveport... tell voting for. Justify graves innocent people. History judge poorly, see, unless Q-Anon cliff lizardman 5G tower nonsense. 25-45 live alone health conditions, risk serious complications really low, risk infecting others. countries use CFR yet cite CFR I’m wrong? 1% much less 3.5% hence problem US. There’s nothing correct, I’m using one method, you’re using another. Whether one wrong right matter opinion. [II don’t think third US population reasonable line since figure 1900s. Well nobody drafted go bar get coronavirus. downvoted? I’m willing bet unconfirmed number way higher. Historically speaking, vaccine made Phase 3 85% probablity success. 3 reached stage, several close behind, chance fail tiny. happy calling liar since malicious heart suffer numerous ailments. Keep excellent stupidity.    

What possible motivation could spending time telling true.  Well then, there's nothing say really. Like said, see mostly knowlessness inexperience, especially racism generally frowned upon China US. may widely regarded something positive even, go around saying they're senseless it.

Anyways, that's I'll agree disagree you. Relevance quarantined COVID-positive Wuhan native area time, Trump’s claims taking preventative measures COVID Pelosi. felt given subject thread, wouldn’t need explained. intelligence reports showing Bill Gates past. however indictments Russians. See difference? Idk theres small chance side effect vaccine covid known long lasting devestating effects. Also covid spreads mean time people wait infecting thousands upon thousands others reasonable? depends. gotten tested 3 times. first time took week. second time took less 24 hours. third time took 2-3 days. Probably 5G antenna masks.

I hate /s, it’s America 2020 people believe nonsense. Milli Vanilli along top- shelf record player. Tupac's hologram Poor Americans busy drugs getting welfare. you’re missing point. Covid. put patients needs own. Irresponsible yes. pandemic, doctors nurses spread thin. time would fair argument say nothing coronavirus wrong. could gotten leg checked that’s one less nurse probably felt cramp it’d fine. I’ll give props, atleast statements dumb like people arguing whether Covid clearly does. Omg that's wrong many levels. sorry know horrible experience work. really shocked puzzled people taking simple precautions preventing spread virus. got masks, social distancing sanitizing. can't majority us accept life like vaccine found. super inconvenient accepted reality living every day!! lucky Im actually ok this. fucking despise loud motorcycles. stereotypical people drive catching covid dying good news me. Dead chads cant ride loud bikes. picked news, makes surprised heard Honestly, given America's track record, I'm keen voting all. Suggesting laughing means I'm saying something think stupid, uninformed, trivially easy prove wrong. 

Why prove stupid funny actually proving wrong? 

I'll answer you. 

Because response. responding way intelligent enough prove wrong afraid even try. 66, poor Stephen finally found calling boot polisher Sturgis. contagious diseases still same, buddy. go search bar type ""Oxford Vaccine"" see goodies. isn’t going bring everything else back normal. wish everyone else would too.

Yep one. I'm sure people hostile. No, quit trying bring manslaughter/murder, it’s fucking retarded, OK? tell justice boner want everyone position authority “pay“ actions unless favor 100% shutting everything. It’s cringe worthy. encourage everyone read article look masks. Make sure actually anything. new data intriguing. Apparently bandanas make droplets. reccomend n95 multiple layers fabric. right masks spreading droplets unmasked. new normal information weapon What's exceptional America huge media sources (primarily Fox News) dedicated spreading misinformation. see un-masked people every one pictures. local rallies virtually mask usage (wasn't mandate time). Still, sounds like making argument outdoor events completely safe everyone mostly everyone masked.  pointing greater mask usage protests data would certainly indicate that. I've tried educate people.

Maybe whining I'm grouping people call community give mind.


I'm calling anyone anything.



I'm pointing Anti-maskers claim people recovered medical conditions years ago, living full healthy lives, die Covid-19 'pre-existing''


While anti-vaxxers quickly blame vaccine, blaming virus.


I'd think many same, wrong.


It's bullshit excuses understand medicine science. never assigned responsibility party post.

It would interesting Trump picks another candidate. think male Pence scapegoat? No, win big money gate foundation. small part is. Bill Melinda Gates use invest many lucrative businesses. Still pay federal income tax, state income tax states. State revenue FL generated property tax, sales tax, government fees. Thus drastic decline tourists visiting buying things means drastic decline state revenue. isn’t event considered national homeland security risk? think so, explain claim I'm willing read cuz could know something #RUH ROH number correct. total death toll United States WWII 402,000. Considering much lower gen population much smaller cities interstate travel now? 

I'd surprised majority America get sick now. question. cracking 5 months (March July) pandemic. 5 months 60 years earth cannot look beyond? It’s temporary one year whole life? never thought would saying this, I’m glad kids’ grandmothers died last year. awful would way worse go illnesses covid able see kids grandkids. I'm much worried thepeople control virus response responding fretting whether top epidemiologist knows wear mask not. Pictures, please! ""braces itself"" sending kids back school, opening churches, opening restaurants shops mostly whatever want. 

""Batten hatches people, looks like we're going able state fair... worry everything else still on"" Great idea! tear billions billions dollars worth structures already built barrier Islands coastal wetlands? Outside national seashores state parks, whole oceanfront East Coast Miami Boston built up. I'm guessing I'd interested guess way line, risk catching COVID would likely mostly empty rest stop bathroom, wearing mask using copious amounts hand sanitizer considerably less eating breakfast indoor diner massive biker rally.

One, take precautions hands (short exposure, mask, sanitizing) mostly safe, other, bad idea (indoor space, likely crowded, masks eating). one wants take measures keeping people home. People keep wondering US acting crazy. I’ll keep saying this: US? North South. 

The South never wanted ruled North seceded. lost civil war doesn’t mean people comprised South changed. didn’t. still hate North still overwhelmingly racist still hate controlled WAY North. 

America two nations always been. 

I hope helps people understand politics US strange look crazy. We’ve living amidst endless cold civil war 150 years. It’s fought culture. 

This won’t end well. may sound callous measure impact quality years-of-life lost (and per capita basis) there’s question impact WW2 dwarfs covid. That’s even apply worldwide US less affected many countries war. comparing man made armed conflict naturally occurring phenomena? real? irresponsible plain simple. nurse neglecting health point needed limb amputated disturbing. think medical professional sort would especially aware dangers ignoring potential health issues. sad lost leg. attribute COVID.

not everything America coronavirus highlighting flaws system. Health care cannot tied employment. we’ll get articles testing labs cutting corners ensure they’re getting results windows highest reimbursement. 

Capitalists gonna capitalize. How

....how think work, then? I'll also add said also applies WWII generation Allied country, including colonies/under colonial rule time. WWII generation inherited world colonialism, imperialism, fascism genocide left world human rights, civil rights economic scientific progress. Yes, perfect, quite frankly, generation humanity's history actually fought implemented much progress did. They're best we've arguably done. European welfare systems largely built generation instance. political been, care someone know serious illness. know even don’t, general takes especially republicans heard believed it’s serious 5 months. 

The “good” news many experienced consequences. there's cannibalism. Drink blood eat flesh Christ. fucking care. 

It’s 30-35% fuck wits don’t care dragging us down. Could possibly fit ads site? Bingo. Tax churches. Zero support schools refuse teach well established scientific facts. Let religion run merit, taxpayer help. Surely pull bootstrap fine. Source nice guy claim? everything know points opposite. Hello Brazil. 45,000,000 1957 Asia flu epidemic 60.000.000 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We’re even close Right? quit job beginning year travel Europe/Asia (lol worst timing ever). passport useless, cancel plans, companies hiring, I've blown savings, I'm fucking pissed fucking nothing half stupid fucking country take fucking seriously god damn wear fucking mask fucking hard. Disinformation president retweets dr demon sex videos destroyed chances decent response virus dunno downvoted. anyone got source? us GAHHH

...I know...I know still using fucking cumulative numbers?? People test positive twice counted twice even occurred months before, people sick March still part number....serious question, cumulative number misleading, look active cases first foremost. look CDC estimation seasonal flu every year US figure 25million+. I’m downplaying seriousness COVID think stop highlighting cumulative number, focus ICU numbers, deaths, recovered daily newly flu virus common number people infected season estimated, determined certain. Centers Disease Control (CDC) calculated annual percentage U.S. population infected flu, results showed 8 percent U.S. population gets sick flu—which translates 26,176,000 million people year. And, it’s estimated 31.4 million people visit doctor, 200,000 end hospital every flu season.   Public trust government institutions relatively high, would think EU mask rates would higher. Also, social safety nets public health care better there, sick people less likely go work sick, opposed people continue working die, whether sick not, can't afford to. things would compound make situation worse here. end pandemic, compare overall death rates EU US get better idea widespread actually got place. yet they'll give hefty side-eye complain damn islamics anyone muttering 'inshallah' dangerous bus journey. Herd immunity explanation  nice see rationality Reddit, especially COVID. Honestly, insane panic got old months ago. COVID cause concern, yes. hardly something force peoples lives stop over. hospitals almost empty. around 70 serious/critical cases significantly better Spain, France Germany. Herd immunity claim questionable best though yes. 45% people even care enough vote last election. people vote, 45% voted reality TV show character, nearly ten percent voted candidates chance winning. anyone surprised country eating death already able turn blind eye new top ten cause death? Uh sorry America progressive you. first country herd immunity. helping population. 'merica #1, haters woooooooo. Survivor country edition air reputable IRB would allowed America sheep decided try control arm pandemic. provide plethora epidemiological data successful nations follow. I’m saying want see people dead. fact people change ways all. They’re stubborn, whatever want call it. So, obviously way keep people harmful others they’re dead. kind idiot goes cruise ship pandemic?

Those things petri dishes GOOD day. paradox American authority seems rebel science common sense population rebels authority think population would pro science common sense spite authority. known infected days showing signs infection since like January. compounds media thing, conflicting reports saying asymptomatic people shed virus, even though clearly do. Masks universal, can't know who's infected. Canadian here. Although fare well compared America, skinny kid fat camp. social welfare state lacklustre underfunded, medical system although free use quite inaccessible well organized, can’t hold candle response covid countries like Vietnam South Korea done. different provinces widely different responses crisis too, conservative provinces like Alberta Ontario fared badly. still go drive thru get meal, go outside park nature preserve, many us still go work.

Where live, stores restaurants open, everyone's work, couple places ask wear masks. I've used drive thru, local taco bell, packed people eating day (it's pretty small). went 20 cases county March thru June, added almost 400 past weeks. one's changing behavior, all. ask, talking about? R0 scientific term. Overshooting scientific term. ""Natural"" adjective... pretty common one, far know, apparently I'm Russian know.

Everything said comment raged true even trying refute it. (Except looked - overshooting R0 2.5 results final infected number 89%. apologize 1% wrong.)

You idea saying angry someone calling bullshit thinking lots dead kids okay. somehow makes Russian troll? I've never seen sign Russian trolls want *fewer* dead American children. extremely efficient testing contract tracking, could still go back normal. Imagine covid test gave results ~10 minutes less 99,9% effective. found potentially infected, like contact someone else later found sick, self-isolate specialised facility two weeks. mandatory, instead left devices. countries already use contract tracking apps effective. Also, temperature checks entrance everywhere. takes seconds, maybe ""normal life"", disruptive either.

I still think people wear masks crowded rooms lot people, whenever possible, that, places people would able go without wear masks time, they'd able go bars pubs, there'd events, etc. covid might immune weeks orphans..... Hi, banned muted coronavirusUS sub moderator making “blanket political” post, rules. post made constructive sociologically sound analysis incumbent parties ideology it’s addressing crisis. don’t understand divorce politics crisis attempting leaves working people intellectually defenseless. 

If you’re going sub that’s scientific nature approach, can’t dismiss valid political critique, it’s real dimension handling virus. didn’t spam saying anyone better vote person group. simply outlined ideological narrative motivations behind actions feel like banned said moderator upset analysis. 

On planet anyone think magically remove politics crisis life? missing fact European countries similar size, often smaller (both physically population) many individual American states. functional equivalency scale US state's individual response Covid-19, EU country's individual response. willfully ignoring biggest differential US EU (in totality) comes efficacy individual responses BASED GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE NEED ACT PROPERLY. Sturgis part area? Half don't. course he'll ANNOUNCE it. Trump whore. able get it. Yes. want us healthy kill grandma. No. wanna die. like idea. would call different countries though? could NE America, Midwest America, West America- there’s already South America. would drop America part altogether? Maybe everyone could vote different options. 

Too bad nothing like ever happen. think Canada would ever start accepting American refugees? quarantine long want beginning, don’t care. Seriously though. Someone help get Canada. Hmm, think get it. example, Washington New York declared states emergencies early on, back March think. Despite this, request federal aid, like PPEs, Trump. Though, OTOH, heard New York, local members national guard immediately activated deployment things (like PPEs) local communities, Cuomo received okay federal power.

I get saying, know understand nomenclature, think completely accurate refer military. Kind gray area guess. Ulcer Sphincter Ass-merica Honestly don’t know still replying. It’s obvious aren’t going agree.

You happily get vaccine. fact supply people like me, going wait. Yes Yeah hate central valley too. Know people there. heat cooks brains cow poop EVERYWHERE. Like science, real progress often made convincing old guard, waiting kick bucket replaced next generation difference Europe making effort managed control numbers slow down, America fudges numbers nothing letting run course. 20-25% tests antigen tests, high false negative rate. 
Most tests gold standard; i.e. RT-PCR. US massive many progressive states handled finely European countries. American handle quarantining progressive state, one EU country nothing people would go there. mentally stressful tiring seeing people follow safety measures “don’t want to”. bullshit reason many dying feeling sympathetic actually lost love ones due COVID-19 feeling cautious this. 

This literally LIFE DEATH think it’s something normal, because...

“It is”

~some guy can't imagine going (because can't actually get pregnant) yeah, rational people form health anxiety right now. I've personally thinking talking someone new online counseling services knows they're actually legit. insanely inappropriate generalization. may unpaid, sure make lot billionaires slightly rich. College football hugely profitable everyone involved except actual players. players benefit small minority make nfl, play long enough get rich, avoid brain damage. stutter

No actually thanks heads lol honesty think people mindset less people jobs. Less people pay social secruity problem home avaliable cheaper cost (if person dies home ) ge bored quarantine crazy bible belt people take pick  Start there. Go around showing pictures nice old folks died. show republicans seem think masks wedge issue.

A big sign. 4 large, colored images dead nice (white) folks. us do. really shows dichotomy culture it’s like here. leadership federal level, aside good doctor, we’re follow state mandates personal ideals. It’s incredibly bizarre embarrassing. general agree conclusions. I'd like think could hit 60% effective immunity threshold, may. positive side, Covid boost immune numbers I'd estimate 10%. However include part calculation . think could dramatic effect US.

That said, point vaccine definite plus.

Best wishes stay safe :) People add groups? That’s scary thought. went /r/canada asked advice polite, cordial way could muster, got called narcissistic monster, I'm still loss.  American problem, culture problem. nation acts age, we're made spoiled children think know everything. call lie. assumed made honest mistake, still thinking 80yos risk way believed back spring. ""proof"" data March-May. ignored disregarded sources.

If ""people sub"" delusional, entire world except tiny sliver US population clinging imaginary idea big deal.

What excuse average age US Covid19 cases deaths continues decline next couple months, summer? Blame... everyone else? proud American :/ honor money people. People byproduct capital gains America. Lose people? always get somewhere. Disinfection useless. school closed two days anyway (weekend) marginal surface transmission dead.

This case virus incubating contact nine cases government bad ineffective. me, Brit, Weird Al song first thing comes mind Albuquerque Kinda fair suppose, even experts proposing Covid could issue 2 years.

I heard 18-24 months many times first month head started spinning. former dollar tree employee, doubt it. shoplifters, told ignore it. serious bud I’m embarrassed American right now. Trump made many Americans numb pain suffering taking place US convinced many conservatives ignore facts believe him. frustrating way. I've mostly apartment past five months, wish people (if they're able to) would same. Sure, Canada much smaller population US, 8,981 people died due COVID. 😂 serious? 350 million people. Many us care. takes 5% (17,500,000 people) population idiots make whole country look like idiots rest world.

That 5%, ""it happened me"" attitude. people wear helmets seat belts they've never needed one. people drink drive know handle alcohol. shit stink, they're gods gift Earth. universe revolves around them. rights.

Sadly lot people like US. They're beyond entitlement behavior. think world owes something want.

And stay way happens them.

""omg, thought hoax, whole family died.... idiots were"".

The way people wearing helmets seat belts turn around something happens them.

It's sad.

These people seem lack ability watch another person suffering use lesson lives. experience suffering themselves. 


Not mention complete lack empathy people people get sick. 


There actually people covid (tested positive) ignored instruction went public like fine regardless countless others infecting. 


Oh change anything, rights! violate rights!! 


People dying, fuck rights. 


/A caring American. phase 3 trials mostly two doses. can't get 100% immunity one dose leading vaccines. might get 75% single dose. Two doses, 28 days apart really effective, trials going 


People worried hurrying safety. vaccines perfectly safe. get perfect immunity. get 75% multiple doses. 18 months now, we'll see single dose vaccines. time trade-off, safety vaccine, given far people getting virus, kill maim people virus. 

Regarding EAU, can't denounce vaccine given without proper, traditional FDA approval? can't go there? grandma died January 30th ""unknown"" viral pneumonia. sat side 3 days died. Keep away grandma costs. agree 100%. Also, every location got slammed early days much higher death rates places getting slammed today. governments current hot spots better job, doctors eveloped effective treatment protocols yet early days, short equipment. What’s said. Well half us care half doesn’t explain nearly 6% death rate vs us 3% Haha imagine trying censor people reddit Reckless behavior gets others sick.
Safe behavior keeps others getting sick.

Unfortunately, many people don’t understand. wonder there's something causes people veer topic still think they've refuted others.... New generation voters cynical towards **Republican** government. They're killing last remnants voter base. absurd. used ""blast"".... Definitely ignorance *Waving hands around*

No. Low numbers going slightly areas go local lockdowns, America locking control numbers thats difference. Lol states finally shut 2300 deaths day. got 300 averaging 1350 rising day. Every country able shut back open now. Republican America fucked MAGAs screwed country.

How hard fuck sister wear mask? Exactly, private citizen able wander around looking unmasked people use force make wear mask.

 I'm figuratively watching people drill holes boat *and there's nothing realistically stop them.*  No, not. Thw woman Texas interviewed ""fitness guru"" sells detox garbage. Good choice. paper could seem find February, suggests 2-5 days (also depends outside conditions : temperature, humidity...)

Article written study: 

Scientific study mentionned:

But even then, point people consider risk exposure surfaces low, worry much

 Let's 250,000 people go Sturgis. Average age death COVID 78 years old US. Average age death COVID worldwide 80 years old. 50% deaths obese people. (even overweight)

Open country up. need pander fat old thought clear this. No, don’t care. Italy, ""the model country pandemic"" OMS described it,yeah cared people went full maga shit Truth tell, probably would asked resign fired outright done that. 

I suspect number doctors health officials employ state held tongue realizing people charge would wanted regardless science.  quoting Trump ok random downvote. say now!! USA! USA!! USA!!!

/s Ridiculous. making bunch $$$ vaccines. what, $3 $20 dose? profit center anyone.   kind mask? N-95 respirator fit tested masks reduced risk 50%, every healthcare worker whose job exposes Covid-19 patients would catch within patients. Try reading founding documents, starting Declaration Independence. comment never read book topic, think simple. European countries deaths per 1M also Andorra, San Marino feel sorry kid. Holy shit. Imagine brain-dead parents. failure leadership. Make mistake. There's shortage reagents inability get quickly. could implemented ways increase manufacturing reagents. Instead mobilizing military citizens. leadership garbage. Trump virus? yet term google knows 😉 care. We're entitled. That's ever worked.

Right there, says ""Everyone (conditions apply) gets cast vote"", pretty much next thing follows is: granted vote chose cast vote, also chose whichever dimwits showing highest numbers voting booths decide future possibly four years. equivalent I'm good whatever outcome, cannot bothered.

And currently I'd handy example even possibly costs people even week register vote vote altogether - would've good choice, everyone involved. context, California 22nd country cases per capita. 29th deaths.

With appearing dropping. already COVID degree immunity, least short term. going Disney seems super low risk (that would catch again) (that could transmit you, immune). Getting COVID beating almost assuredly going give individual higher immunity vaccine will.

If anything praising roommates helping economy continue safe way rest us stuck home. Measured IQs continued increase leaded gas period.

Correlation require causation. ""Don't care?""

about opinions Europe? really. age groups outside 65+ IFR like 0.0017 daughter fine. someone came national strategy instead states compete medical supplies equipment...

But hey, it’ll gone July, right??? There’s distinction people dying “from” Covid people dying “with” Covid. shoot head fail die, wind hospital contract Covid there, you’re Covid death made hospital money. 

Maybe it’s prevalent state. NY pretty bad it, plenty states. Yep! chickenpox herpes virus, like mono, herpes 1 2. 

So, van technically come back us (like cold sore flare ups mono flares ups)

Honestly, interesting also unnerving.. agree statement solution everything over-prescription pills.

There's plenty countries federal/state government split system like ours, including Germany, Brazil, Australia, India lot more. countries done fine, I'd say Brazil bad example, can't use federalism excuse this. heard states defense forces going combat? examples? I'm calling friend liar, I'm familiar that. needs relax bit you. would risk live virus vaccine (and development) initial flight live virus thus quite safe high risk folks.

Respect! Seems thing going around lately distract us pandemic. Ive seeing alot people post similiar stuff. Im trying take away human trafficking lives destroyed it, last time similiar rumors got started i.e. Pizzagate, happened Trump running president afterwards. Wouldnt surprise one bit counter propaganda campaign. went sturgis 2012. Don’t step grass. pointed mostly people self-inflicted health conditions. Maybe one them? Homeschooling effective teaching is. sis hs'ed years Master's degrees great jobs. brothers hs'ed K-8 PhDs great jobs competitive fields. mom kick-ass teacher. 

We're homeschooling second grader year due Covid-19 things situation change, may offering host pod teaching kids grade. Preferably kids otherwise would option due financial concerns. time frame? lose million people year due treatable/preventable illnesses injuries annually anyhow. correct. People did. countries shown beaten. perfect leadership like “we initially thought everyone would get science proven beat plan beat this...”

Science situations change, needs communicated! joke. buddy. No. Don’t worry. money printing machine. $3T appeared nowhere. It’s like taking science test without pen. that, studied economics instead science. doomed get F. mostly agree oxford one, HELL Moderna one. 

1) Moderna never successfully created vaccine before; also new tech general.

2) fighting government agencies regarding oversight trials, highly unusual;

3) Chief Technical Officer Chief Medical Officer dumped stock company last months, watchdog groups calling fraud investigations;

4) trump appointed top Moderna executive big stockholder adminstration's vaccine program. people stupid? yeah... figured worse ways sexist said little, sexist would’ve sufficed. US failed state, existence 300 years.

Or recognizing fact? Smart strategy. Trump man known always return favours never fail support ally. Hey, gotta sacrifice wanna make great. Let’s see studies.  don’t think that’s unreasonable.  we? wasn't. talking generally, impact.

But yes, right happened US, probably unlikely will. However, happened US elsewhere reduction people admitted hospitals people decide seek medical attention fear infected. think much impact longer areas, significant reduction people showing hospitals New York back April. has, without doubt, caused excess deaths result pandemic, could count indirect COVID-19 deaths. He'll eventually right! happening way?

What describing exponential growth real observed trend seems linear. statistical analysis real world data. specifically, American dollar. dollar crisis goes parabolic, America deep deep trouble. call transitionary phase China comes number one, China gets economic boost (its oppposite), America sink low, even devasted China come top due manufacturing capacity. 

High corperate consumer debt, lack liquidity markets ,interest rates low get, lack foreign investors excess money printing due deflationary pressure, something Americans deal pretty soon, like 2021 soon. dollar peaking. pyramid scheme come end. Covid speeds impeading collapse dollar. 

It scare world considering 79% assets worldwide tied dollar. Many lose savings, investments, pensions, benefits, standard living take massive hit global economy resets. Cuts defense, social security, medicare pretty much guaranteed programs survive all. hope Americans like paper dollars broth chinese wont want trade worthless dollar anymore. yet  Yeah, let's ignore allies trying get Trump removed arbitrary tribalism. never heard concept enemy enemy friend? Hundreds thousands Americans dying inaction, ""they're still Republicans""? really? That's focusing this?  


Fuck it, Russia won. wanted, worked you. Congrats dude. subreddit clamps mention politics political people. ""They're still Republicans"", can't damn website anymore. American complicated issue. people take precautions frustrated inconsistency saying forget it. small minority think hoax sure. Europeans looking taking account vast cultural differences. Americans general like restricted comes day day, tight restrictions causing people lose jobs plunge poverty months instability come conclusion virus population 99% rate survival, would rather go back work risk supposed remedy worse disease. missed that? coronavirus preventable sickness?  whatever want. taking risk. contract COVID ask prayers gofund future realize badly messed up, remember dumb take lightly. going refute anything gets thrown way anyways, what's point. Yes sir. republic democracy. means choose people represent you. Based see government leaderships one fighting well “people” choose represent. So, yeah. Americans don’t care. Good luck nanny. covid positive cases county 18-24 year olds since DGAF social distancing. 

It sucks die WW2? well go. guess wont coming back then? Government scalable. somehow forget US? Yet Trump says ok. control. need test much. Yet death toll keeps rising, number cases still rise, keeps spreading. Hmmmm. good. mean federal government withhold funds way? people use bathroom somewhere? people want eat food drink open restaurants bars? Hey, *it is*, right?...

/s That’s drug combo, doxycycline. Ivermectin. much difference think made current official death count?  pandemic still joke. Can’t believe we’re shutting everything virus who’s avg death age 78 less deadly flu per case basis. Thanks people see posting Bill Gates conspiracy theories Facebook also type check every business ever visited post mundane details day-to-day life 
Yup.

Enemy enemy situation here. still exponential? I'm carrying virus go store infect two people, two people infect two people each, exponential growth? understand concerned vaccine “rushed” person works develop drugs want explain give examples cannot rushed process. 
First all: data data data, doesn’t matter badly want work whose pocket in. never rush data. test take five weeks finish still take five weeks finish even ask everyday (I constantly remind people that). data show vaccine safe, can’t convince data change “we need vaccine quickly”. clinical study data safety efficacy public knowledge approved drugs vaccines. current administration anyone makes exception decide disclose data, take vaccine. 
Now examples rushed:
1) lots people US vast majority partners work EU summer vacations. even work site pretty much shutdown entire month August. priority project like this, people convinced changed vacation plan. 2) prioritization every step. lab involved one analytical testing step standard turn around time 5 days lab work, review, reporting data. may asked 2 days. Still amount work people staying late night weekends. I’ve plenty times tight timeline turn computer work Sundays lab experiment finished late Saturday night. even COVID vaccines. 3) agency review times LONG. review time typical submission 6 months. Even simple H submission review time 100 days. want request meeting may take two month get meeting schedule. Doesn’t mean need time rather get line reviewer 8 hours day. prioritization COVID vaccine jump front automatically. reviewers could assigned people working overtime it. level review scrutiny, less time. 4) time drug development production long. lot work needs done commercial production. companies won’t even start discussion research portion project mostly completed product showed great chance approval. COVID vaccine companies preparing commercial production parallel. risk last clinical trial fails loss early investment commercial side. works well could easily save years timeline. typical example risk guided decision making. 
Personally I’m optimistic vaccines. would follow closely trails approvals read approval documents FDA EMA. checked compliance industry standard practice would gladly take vaccine soon one made available me. Mr Dolan tramp ware I. coworker convinced it. classic symptoms including loosing smell. hospitalized two separate times bad shape awhile (he made full recovery!) tested negative couldn’t get coronavirus leave ran sick leave some. treated severe pneumonia. March testing shortage couldn’t get second test. payroll tax cut (if passed) paid back, don’t want it. really wants forced short term loan?  That’s plain stupid. Let eat covid Oh, justifies it. Carry on. always believe everything read?

Do always believe conspiracy theories moron uncle emails you? Around one every 2,602 Americans killed virus far. include excess mortality cause may covid-19, number approximately one every 1,100. see saying agree part. still trials going tho. It’s hey here’s possible vaccine wants it? still tests show efficacy, otherwise would’ve already hundreds vaccines COVID market. luckily it’s Trump research, still experts making candidate vaccines trials Ok, heard 3rd test.

Hope land new job next week. manipulated numbers data, anything data like. Yes myocarditis without symptoms. 

You damage heart without symptoms. 

What think causing temporary abnormal result EKG? decreased strength heart contractions? Damage heart is. 


Active myocarditis defined “an inflammatory infiltrate myocardium necrosis and/or degeneration adjacent myocytes typical ischemic damage associated coronary heart disease”.-Interpretation: small inflammatory cells found heart causing damage heart itself. cells include monocytes neutrophils occasionally eosinophils, roles killing infections infected swelling. Myocarditis inflammation causing DAMAGE. sometimes, always. I. Just. Can't Germans 1939 80 million

I would like stay informed, need telling wet water every fucking day. 

Fuck. ""Some drugs tamp immune response, others enhance it. Everybody seems throwing kitchen sink illness. may true people die hyperinflammatory response, appears likely us block [immune much, going able control virus."" 

The typical quandary auto-immune disease too. suppress immune system build up. study, latter preference covids-19, immune systems deceased far weakened over-potent. Proud Canadian. Thought article would piss find accurate good feel differing cultures.

Vast political differences obvious reason feel article misses huge gulf regarding religion two countries.   
Religion huge deal here.

Most American zealots would spit Jesus give second time , let alone follow teachings. Remember, masks mostly prevent infected people spreading others. virus air, also get via eyes. Avoid people without masks. Makes wonder go church all. all, individual them, thing society.

You're reason put spikes benches. reason cops destroy people's belongings, throwing wheelchairs. probably want blame Republicans, truth is, happens cities Republicans aren't.

You probably call progressive, you?

You probably even think *better than* people, racist sexist actually surprise homeless person brazen stupid?

You problem, Karen. [Um. *[In USA] people 80s account less half covid-19 deaths; people 40s, 50s 60s, meanwhile, account significantly larger share die. median covid-19 sufferer America 48-year-old; Italy 63-year-old.* Sweden says otherwise. It’s theory right I’m definitely going keep eyes  I’m convinced nothing morals somehow believe sort karma wishing death someone else cause bad luck them. also think wishing death brian kemp via Covid wishing death upon normal person minding business don’t think they’ve thought daydream enough. vaccine combined genetic predisposition narcolepsy. different ways vaccines made one method used caused immune response person's body.

one want read effectiveness masks still debate? 

Wow.  Don’t sorry, you’re good. 

I’m American, something I’ve noticed time madness always comes glimmer information we’re reach from. example, supposedly contacted Parishioner something two weeks prior injection debacle, via letter, “informing” guy inner cleaning liquid cure thing straight turned fucking disinfectant. that’s obviously train thought came from. remembered letter asked question live TV aides.

Terrifying easily influenced. weak man never much power.

**EDIT** found it! Cool, according tool ascertainment bias 10, GF's dad's wedding next week (indoor, Catholic church, bride groom refuse wear masks) 70% chance Covid-positive attendee. Cool. I'm attending. Progress happens one funeral time definitely agree like said it’s theory could something big No. impressive. live Illinois, move Nunavut. Weather same, right :) rioting (which also coincidentally occurs Democrat run areas) Coronavirus, lot overseas friends actually surprised I'm still alive.  sortof, rich folks wanting workers challenge way life, even pandemic. Insert form governance caters special group, problem. Regardless class warfare end well historically anyone involved. sniffles...

It is.... thought ""it disappear like anything else"" ""we lower world"". care recover? fiery blazes hell Biden opposition Trump has? drugged hateful even children shoot schools

I say hateful society blame. lot what's wrong untreated mental diseases. problem that:

a: Mental disease taken seriously (applies globally America-specific thing)

b: Healthcare America overpriced point insanity. Forget mental disease, people can't even afford go real, tangible physical diseases. even diagnosis, still need buy medicine. thing choice. one nearly every modernized country managed, US simply won't. know people need healthcare, mostly people screaming go work healthcare one's scream ""SOCIALISM"" moment someone suggests uncoupling healthcare employment.

Fuck farm stimulus poorly executed. least cattle feeders. 

$230 per head cattle sold January - April 15 

$30 per head April 15 market actually bad. 

There times Jan-April 15 time market good better last year. severely missed mark this. customers March selling $1.30+ fat cattle worse last year. get $230 per head. 

The guy sold June 15 .95 cents per pound $1.15 get nothing. So... Yeah garbage. 

Feeders sold right meat shortage hit got live cattle last year also got extra money. absolutely take they've fucked beef cartel years. take handout get. sold may get nothing.

The last 3 years I've sold replacement heifers $1300 each. year sold paid 4 months prior. buy 680 lbs $1000 sell 900lbs $1000. amount corn hay took get course decent chunk $. sold April 20 instead April 15 lose $200 per head worked 4 months loss. $200 head would least maybe paid feed bill. imagine frustration cattle feeder pay work part food supply pandemic. You’re really following around now? Glad see you’re homophobic racist, also ableist. loser. Uh, they’re immune. Literally. Thankfully live New York state, committed shutdown shelter place seeing reduced cases almost deaths now. concerned allowing schools reopen, especially colleges state/country students bringing virus them. Haha gay mod bot LMFAO liberals think weak virtue. MIGHT sick week already it. I'm fine. week laying bed done. hundreds thousands cases trying downplay non deadly virus play ""lingering effects"" showing 4 people using fear mongers like BBC CNN sources ""prove death all"" look dude NBA players playing. fool. sheep. 4 examples enough. Show even 1% lasting effects. Ffs common cold lasting symptoms people. miseducated believe fits narrative. WAKE UP. Using mask protect covid like putting chain link fence mosquitos.

Edit: EVERY liberal friend/boss/cousin/coworker sooooo bad. Yet people know anyone 86% show symptoms. death count inflated there's proof. first guy responded asking understand sarcasm impression me? sure that? European watching, also completely unsurprised. mean even delivery drivers stopped wearing masks. infuriating.

Some dude gave shit answered door mask, said, ""it's you, me. able live got someone sick &amp; died.""

He got annoyed said stay inside. Thinking empathy dead. sign paperwork treatment facility gives full access. know seems silly, hassle already stressed, every person lives caring spouse like you. live abuser, even dork like FIL would blab embarrassing details surgery wife private parts drunk parties neighbors. Plus, patients go NUTS slightest information ‘leak’, even discussing case professionally colleague improve care (legal), tiny accidental disclosures, like someone else name, leaving voicemail wrong number reminding appointment. know else tears childhood away children?

Death. government doesn’t give shit people. affects bottom line people top start drop like flies. hope happen. need go lower. That's cool, to? country wants us point? loss young man 60+ years live average much tragic someone less 6 months left live already lived full life, majority coronavirus victims.

that one way see respect that.

Another way see sacrificing life fight fanatics like nazi japanese cause country took stance fight them, gives sacrifice meaning.

On end sacrificing life government less bare minimum keep safe idiot work you, job could easily home allowed stupid bosses, thinks virus hoax, want put hold right party, catches virus bar gives die, makes sacrifice completely useless absolutely evitable, matter age are. Guess won’t return favor consideration others. Would failed vaccine results people getting sick make look good? Everyone wonders hell people stupid enough wear mask turn around say shit like this. FDA CO-OPTED MAKE TRUMP LOOK GOOD USING UNSAFE VACCINE CAUSES INJURY DEATH. Seriously, rethink actually saying.  sisters supposed travel Ireland two days US banned flights March. lost 4 members close-knit Irish family (see username) four years ago accident best way honor memory help us heal. disappointed cancel, rescheduled last week, thinking SURELY pandemic would control 4 months. Ireland doesn’t want us don’t blame them. grandparents immigrated U.S 1930s search better life. Trump wins November, I’m seriously considering applying dual citizenship moving Ireland search better life. cannot take 4 years dumpster fire administration.  Health kind perilous moment. EU function like US's federal government. EU purely commercial, mostly trade routes. example, US federal government one controls American military. EU military. country EU military, country is, well, country. 

Your analogy would apply country like Italy example fragmented public health responses, 2000 which, scattered across cities. That's works, since European countries independently far national control quarantine US's national power. herd immunity won’t kick 60-70% population exposed. Assuming 5% already exposed 200,000 died, scale 50% TWO MILLION Americans die. US vast majority countries herd immunity achieved vaccine without deaths.  year ago would be. three months ago would be.  number infections 420,000, that’s reported number CONFIRMED cases. rough approximation IFR around 1% NY get around 3.3 Million cases. realize that. better education

This key. luck Europeans also get better education. (certainly biased) headline one imagine horror found decade ago 60 million Americans caught H1N1. weak mask can’t talk devil blinded him, guess screen reader read This. bailed banks. payments deferred (no interest) 6 weeks. Fines exception doctor appointments. Pick date three weeks advance allow people make arraignments. flights. Zero. ever financial cost likely cheaper alternative. Yeah, except excess mortality normal UK weeks. Lmaooooooo mean use money share buy backs stashed seas? guess blind deaf past 3 years saw squander trillon dollar tax cut.


Maybe read economics beyond high-school instead reguartiting good old sparrow eating  shit theory 357944 time , would know giving money people actually best boost economy since actually spend .




But boot licker unironically thinks theses companies robbing country decades need help actuall citizens. guy warned wear mask, walked away put one on, back stop 90 minutes later. think others getting away it? basically forced cops hands. understand everyone ok lawlessness now, get rid police, ok attempt least job? means getting us paid. good stand-off? help? You? R-naught skyrocketing EU. Berliners fed lockdowns. Revellers way Greece, Italy, Portugal. Meanwhile one gave two shits elderly homes massive death rates

Now best time ""herd immunity"" build up. Fair response. Mind linking t-cell immunity research? constitutional use executive order. nothing political stunt. 99.9% sure lawsuit filed next week EO court quickly block it. Yes reality new money flow federal government help struggling public You’d rather coffin instead ? everyone finally learns America huge extremely varied region region. West Coast south nearly different countries. Beat US? Where? Tactical retreats far different defeat. I’m European great deal respect USA, if, beginning year, someone told USA would situation, would never believed it.

I’m still trying figure even possible, completely sure USA going contain pandemic without breaking sweat.

For real, guys, happened? even manage end like this? went wrong response virus? can’t “Trump”, must deeper explanation.

I’m honestly looking explanation, can’t really get head around it, even point articles, there’s need craft long, detailed answer. No. asked 100ish million people vote? must take while. Unfortunately, true Christian modern age. deep seeded persecution complex creating battles feel like they're fighting lord. abortion, homosexuality, covid. need feel like they're repressed pushed back society. Interesting assumed disagreed you. interpreted response unspoken “... maybe die instead”. This. 

I mean knew conspiracy theorists. least thought know talking about. entertaining albeit bit exhausting. 

But Covid brought worst people. It‘s necessarily repeat what‘s said internet/FOX ABSOLUTELY unwilling anything remotely helpful. 

Look bright side: know who‘s moron isn’t. That‘s worth lot. sadly way many americans don’t even believe real lol I’m sorry. forgot /s. drives insane well definitely money grab. college moving 99% classes online, still encouraging people live campus. Luckily give us option cancel housing contracts school year starts, many students going that. friend said it. didn’t realize strain got mild. think another large problem seen failure American people... actually result intentional lobbying commercial interests due political system set up. leaders helping us navigate pandemic actually helping large corporations navigate people's expense. Then, everyone blames public lack self control. See also- sugar food industry obesity. Nope. Notice News section, Opinion section, marker, either. 
 
It's news story European reactions (which are, sure, opinions) unfolding US chaos.

Just news story reports peoples' opinions make opinion piece. I’m honestly trying sound like smart ass, current administration already pointing us direction. America going ruined one way another either revolution incompetent leaders, frankly I’d rather die orange, I’d rather die trying actually make good country.

Frankly put don’t faith American system believe it’s going fail kill millions neglect/for profit, seems pointless American died making country better place they’d dying someone else make easy money. might skewed sense self worth, anyone gonna make money body want people care about.

So guess right. want America destroyed something better take place. hope assholes get severe cases COVID recover new outlook.

There’s another option Every day 7700 Boomers Silent Generationers die.

Every day goes by, 7700 fewer people country deny climate science, epidemiology, economics.

Every day we're 7700 corpses closer becoming sane country. I’m sorry brat Reddit get attention. know you’re lashing need hug. DM need someone talk to. Hahaha. Really though! Like read!? drives insane. make sense given protests outdoor events, many without masks outbreaks. Ah, I’m camps still happening far. many people wearing masks lots folks needing n95 type masks various types work/applications, happened n95 dust masks? still cant found stores No, ones dont' wear masks care anymore. Even ones dying too. We've seen US Sunbelt rise, peak, decline, summer. knows fall bring, see pattern sigmoid curve declines rapidly 15-25% seroprevalence repeated again. know strictly ""herd immunity,"" clearly level *critical* immunity. many college students tested positive? party animals? know! Shit, news Considering lack universal health care, poor job benefits, education, etc answer quite obvious. Trump: ""Go, infect world little minions!"" Obviously manuals! also ""I hope"" part lol 

Next time write DISCLAIMER! BLM protests compare people refuse follow precautions?

The media decides photographs video footage show public. Given political climate, question *certain* photographs video footage promoted, others? 

These experts media criticize people going beach, parks, golfing, amusement parks, on, name. criticize BLM protests directly.  example, Fauci's response asked specifically protests. willing say generic ""You stay away crowds, matter crowds are"", criticize BLM protests name way. imagine cautiousness people going beach playing golf? 

Besides, know police used tear gas pepper spray disperse crowds. tear gas pepper spray designed irritate, leading people remove masks continuously coughing violently. droplets coughs yelling *the* major way covid spread? 

Supporting ideas behind BLM protests criticizing BLM protests spreading covid mutually exclusive. first individual's political stance, second matter science. want get politics science, means **all** politics, politics agree/disagree with. No, people selfish Keep beaches open goddamit tiddly shark Let’s agree infected end. don’t care dying anymore. There’s nothing live anymore. Everybody replaceable.  Lower bound rule thumb: infected = 200\*deaths Ontario 100 cases 7 day average 

Toronto's average really low well 

And today province 1000 active cases (981) Think mean Good thing unemployment bonus also going stick around. Wow.

You managed read 10 minute article within 3 minutes? Read article typing response next time. majority Americans support stricter coronavirus policies director Taiwan's CDC last week warned complacency, especially considering 2 cases people testing positive left Taiwan, raising fears potentially undiscovered cases. 
This week, everyone saw public buses masked up, started seeing people stores wearing masks again. Schools temperature checks, students teachers wearing masks again.
So, complacency set in, take much boot back vigilance mode. seems study make happened loads children got infected summer camp Georgia.

Also, remember “inclusion“ classes, classes contain special education students general education students, special education teacher general education teacher working together time. Another possibility teacher referring might dealing kids low academically taught standalone class specifically special education students.

Being special education teacher horribly time-consuming frustrating job, takes special kind person job. top spending hours hours writing IEP‘s, special education teachers routinely go 2-4 hour meetings get screamed parents special education students. parents want vent frustration power trip 99% time.

The flipside special education teachers generally great job security required additional certification. Ok, gotta ask ... who/what would worth risk?

So yes, deadly virus better non deadly one. stopped tracking them, many! process usually take years? risk dying, already showing many people developing life long disabilities. maybe think wallets. Betsy DeVos? C'est clairement pas assez efficace lol. could let happen shrew? 3-14 days iirc. point still stands though. k-12 schools operate daycares. main purpose free parents work. technology learn home people afraid means COVID. non-tiny-island country early? People leave. Hard get flights come back(NZ citizens)you pay quaratine $3100. [And South Africa fomite study slides transmission primary means spread.)

In bats, fecal-oral disease, dunno denial possibility. (Coronaviruses fecal-oral mammals matter.) said months away Trump winning 2nd term Wow teach middle school can’t wear cigarette alcohol advertising usual width straps etc.  Boo hoo cry river. think school counselors got bad, think parents infected children. school counselors hardly useful anything. WTF?! That’s aerosolisation works. breath plume without mask three meters long meter diameter. also stays air several minutes starts dispersing. Size doesn’t matter all. Good hope so, we've spent last decade legalization fence commenting wrong post? post nothing ICU capacity elderly care spring.  Guess jersey governor believes need casinos clubs bars gyms  Who's going overhaul? people power based system?

Civil war revolution. would know? Stop stereotyping.  Going back classroom Monday. spot back yard garden picked ashes! America gone full stupid sake economy.

How kids school even helping economy? imagine money comes pay unemployment insurance, food stamps loans? imagine consequences printing money without limit? know nothing inflation, deflation subsequent hyperinflation followed catastrophic collapse? never heard economic disasters Weimar Republic? suggest educate making shallow claims feel virtuous pretending know enough opine 'save lives'. Looks like many people taking casually even jokingly (I understand humour maybe thing still left). troubled sorry this. Lives lost unnecessarily due political narratives lack empathy. least part inevitable. happened to.

I writing Brazil, also hit hard, part due conflicting political agendas lack efficient national coordinated plan. believe US relate.

I hope best American people (and oen) already suffered enough pandemic. time seriously reflect society created ourselves, quality leadership elected power structures allowed stablished countries. nothing close, today, founding fathers dreamed of, unfortunately. weird I'm pretty sure even kids go along reasoning ""this way get sick die"" Ok, seriously?!

I get anti-Fauci crap. man never done anything help Americans repaid death threats family ridicule top politicians. 

If anyone hand vaccine profit, Trump. already tried several times buy supposed cures. definitely this. increase happens large number people start doctors telling do, wearing masks, social distancing. schools open see another increase 20% opinion.  think they're treating like challenge. Incredible like virus behaving exactly always been. knew praying work? people dying Fauci explained ""confidence"" without essential data support prove claim meaningless. means ""confidence"" could without data yet tested purely speculative. never feel confident dealing something requires randomized placebo-controlled trial prove it. feel confident start see data come in. I'm confident guessing surmising,"" Fauci added. posted 3 sources say data. CFR bad math. article posts reasons dont look CFR pandemic use end. also posted CDC telling weigh severity C19 IFR. give range accounted guess many untested positives. 

I honestly idea 3 people excluded non-tested positives math. know people catch dont get tested. FOX, rest lamestream media “We Italians always saw America model,”

It still is, way expression usually used. believe good intentions, way attracted attention using hyperbolized statements (and admitting chose words cause would get media's reaction) serve well.  Sure do. artificial life form, pasty complexion, can't dream, needs emotions chip, no? emcee Paris Procopis **compared mask mandate beginning train trip,” Procopis said. “When telling people get trains, ‘Oh, you’re going.’ know, sending people concentration camps murdering millions. think trying see much get away with.”

Yeah, wearing mask protect safety fellow citizens, pretty much thing. WTH wrong guy? “The ICU wards comparatively empty,” said Dr Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér, Karolinska University Hospital. “Elderly people taken hospitals—they given sedatives oxygen basic care.”

Yes, given morphine widely-known inhibit respiration, would say age-based genocide. 

The EU needs intercede.  Oh yawn. reads like ""President Trump refuses wear mask; drops dead day after, contracted COVID-19"".

Oh yawn. Yeah. people seem picked sarcasm comment. guess say easter facebook.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

You making bold claims part world clearly know nothing about. data anything else back up. 

Are 100% sure ideological axe grinder here? really looks like parroting things fit anti-mask anti-lock narrative. Huh, lutz, trinity, Brooksville. Strange see local towns lined like that. I’m Odessa ✌️ 9 cases. lol gonna SHITLOAD nine pretty soon. I've read ""eliminate infected"" thought expert North Korea Nice try Pete's Polonium Wholesalers, falling one again. know it’s overused meme Pikachu shocked face would fit well lol dear parents, politicians tell send kids school well, ring bell you?  
listen doctors scientists rather politicians... vaccine yet? Naw, coronavirus deniers / anti maskers usually cops, they're generally perceived crazies.

When BLM protests police closed streets protesters let thing.

There's lot tension happening center country right now, I'm sorry hear things tense there. know idiots point except encourage start conventions. No, say that. I'm saying telling victims XYZ stop happening people manipulative wrong. talk x amount deaths, start finding reasons who's responsible. 'my grandfather died' go 'he died Trump, go stop happening again'. guilt tripping them, fucking leave alone. essentially become clear imo stopping covid US now, either burn population fully slow infect huge number people time vaccine found. Even adiministration change happens nothing done time till early next year minimum. truely hope im wrong..... That’s really gotta suck people state. got friend way NC going there.

Not sure stay campus, return. Except going health problems life. here's one recent Korean study indicates kids 10 spread virus efficiently adults 

Teachers paid enough risk. unlock it, please type ""Croissant"" small typewriter hidden inside head Statue believe new position permanently eliminate reelected, i.e. immediately kill Social Security. Thanks! Success produces complacency. Taiwan done everything well far. Let’s hope figure out.  Zero Corona risk, too. “No, Mr President, ‘incredible’.” 😣 We're turning grief people loss something benefits us. Leave alone. Germany also getting cases again. went 1k new infections per day days ago. seriousness, stop school alltogether year? Let virus run course, kids pick left next year. Everyone finishes school year later normal. Try injecting it? effective mask fitted N95. Three-layer surgical masks cotton masks, many people making home, also performed well.

You seem like type that's dense enough take ""break leg"" literally. anti-police rhetoric. newborn start working next week (been home since February) 
I nervous/anxious. teacher teach 5 classes (25-30 students class). building badly ventilated, classrooms small.. 
My husband works home, isn’t around people luckily. 

We careful, baby think. People around us saying cautious, stay inside house much.. live people stubborn social distancing isn’t working all. see people going holidays abroad (we live Europe), parties, dinner, barbecues, beach days, shopping... 

I think one surrounding takes seriously enough hits home one day. Must immunity parts Sweden. Barely admissions hospitals Stockholm anymore. Still many regions low volumes infected people probably increase many parts country I’m one taking vaccine immediately. Shocking I’m anti masker, virus denier believe science. however mistrust government, don’t fool. leading vaccine candidates using new science yet used humans. vaccines brought market record speed good reason. attempting make vaccine roughly 10% normal time using new technology. Also interesting vaccine producing companies liability injury death result product.

It’s forced martyrdom healthcare workers get sick die this. don’t want feel good accolades. It’s heroic it’s sad. many people die usually per year? think coming soon. see we've passed 5 million cases. Projections adjusted hit 6.4 million end month. imagine much worse overpopulation would get 11 billion people every year wallet disagrees numbers years lost (to live) still lot less WW2. 

Example made numbers: life lost WW2 would mean 40 years lost. COVID-19 life lost would mean 10 years lost. Based age individual died. average. 

Before downvote comment, let say moral discussion I’m myself. life view equal importance, matter what. also think *year life* equal value. can’t get two statements/values work together... describes cramp like sensation. Holy hell can't imagine ignoring cramp persisted even full day. That'd really alarming situation already Omg that's amazing. recently talking think news source would trust would dry clinical boring. SARS vaccines failed antibody-enhanced disease vaccine made actual disease *worse* without vaccine. Dengue viruses also type interaction immune system: vaccine dengue, people eligible vaccine already dengue - prevents second infection bad, given first infection makes worse.

I sure hundreds covid19 vaccine candidates fail variety interesting reasons. knows quirks successful ones have, way early know quirks be. 

There reason think vaccine would make anyone super spreader. Nothing coronavirus patients far vaccine ever would support that.

Being overweight drag immune system. Overweight people likely trouble fighting infections, likely autoimmune diseases, less likely strong immune responses vaccines. true vaccines, reason think coronavirus vaccine would different, mean anything people healthy weight. I'm ""dismissing"" anything, I'm merely pointing even theaters added total amount US casualties still small fraction total lives lost.

If want look impacted US terms deaths, go death percentage. WW2 worse, COVID.

However, still stupid lose 300.000 people easily preventable disease That's crazy. tone def, maybe that's point. top we've also got lot people infected COVID-19 virus! 2019, 2018, 2017... around 2.8 million Americans died.

1) Vaccines effective people go back normal life

2) Vaccines moderately effective, people go back normal life roll dice

Keeping masks social distancing going happen. Welcome United States, nothing strictly enforced ""suggested"". feeling bad them. Stay home. pandemic going on. time holiday trips. am, half fellow f—ers won’t stay home wear f—ing mask. f—ing stay home f—ing longer. F—ers. I’m sure month, hundred thousand people trying vaccines vastly different hundred thousand people. Also, vaccine still side effects make phase 3, it’s determined reactions they’ve witnessed acceptable side effects. They’re saying they’ve witnessed possible side effects. General public likely get 2 3 months anyway would make game much fun involved play. Mutations like ""reduced immune system"" would good early effect, since would lead increased vulnerability re-infected later mutations. study talking :  wear middle-eastern head covering. red white checkered kind. always get weird looks, since I’m super white. brought back living Egypt, thought great chance actually wear here.. lol thanks job? idea people think workers ""heroes"". stupid narrative. father, 4x6 foot flag garage says “Trump 2020, BULLSHIT” believes (not George Soros thing, “Bill Gates fucking us”). won’t listen me, works covid patients who’s lost coworkers it, listen Tucker Carlson Trump. No, excess deaths probably missed medical care such, directly due covid. Americans care. may even idiots US elsewhere. ""I X of... freedom!"" idiots much common here, ruin everyone.

Of course Trump disaster, healthcare system many, none helps.  Hopefully safely behind scenes, someone take aside private heart heart. He’ll tested, it, he’ll corralled he’s safe around. bound folks around would rather safe sorry. “It takes village ...” going play Boston Calling May Red Hot Chili Peppers Foo Fighters.

1 year whole life. Literally, told people expect year disruption, maybe year half. That's rearrange.

People fucking patience. deserve happens, get sympathy. people choice actual victims. family members selfishness harm deserve sympathy. fools get straight head, could genuinely double around mid-January (if before).   Problem America there’s like 35% total fucking moron problem dumb rocks proud ignorance, makes believes whatever ideas reality make feel comfortable, availing benefits actual intelligent study science people morons think corrupt liars. group morons strategically located political valued 55% people morons care everyone (the 10% people aren’t morons don’t give fuck anyone besides theirs) Wtf? try suggest something tell good time COVID. 

Enjoy miserable life. Holy shit. God damnit Chris wtf!? See, problem... 

Literally 9 posts this, sub, title “Dr. Anthony Fauci says chance coronavirus vaccine highly effective ‘not great’...

How America come together “leaders” contradicting ideas media continues exploit knowing (not all) take headlines out-of-context quotes, face value? saw AZ sub, data Hospital Utilization: COVID Hospitalizations dropped 2%.

Greek website especially beginning horror, absolutely unworthy country, actually depends tourists much.
2. Flying NL, thing asked whether one indeed registered, one wanted see anything. Another example every airport pleases... first one false positive, second one false negative? reply based pure emotion actually valid point. Think it... 10 people died would consider success, right? still going tell families victims lives drop bucket. Harley still makes air cooled engines work better high elevation riding? Parents tip via Venmo! Thanks lot. hope government gets shit together, too. tough see people get sick and/or die reduced/avoided. Florida uniquely screwed. state income tax depend tourism taxes pay bills. Without people flocking Didney Worl beach bars we’re big trouble. believe burden proof skeptical earth isn’t sphere?  things happened span months. See, view end spectrum. So, no, 81 still almost 100, 90.

Would professional institution let get away that? They'll fall back high survivability rate proof virus nothing worry about, ignoring symptoms linger weeks even mild cases, ignoring people spent weeks hospital, ignoring people died. That's what's happening locally, city getting bombarded people complaining high survivability rate proves virus overblown simultaneously complaining masks control, even though makes sense. love schools think custodians’ lives disposable teachers’ lives Oh, clear absolutely fucking judging every single person attending supportive rally. Closer home, case 40-something high schoolers going together Myrtle Beach (why always Myrtle Beach?) bringing back bunch cases. Also judging parents thought good idea. stings pretty hard see pictures people who’ve gone Outer Banks, family supposed earlier summer, except made tough decision cancel. 

But family taking road trip lake house? spending weekend camping? agree sharing images Facebook normalizes idea everything ok, it’s impossible know precautions *have* taken aren’t visible images. Personally one activity I’m could considered “risky” practicing aerials gym. Except videos share, can’t see number cleaning supplies hand sanitizer use student, fact I’m alone room learning instructors video, I’m using personal silks bought, we’re wearing masks whenever we’re apparatuses limit transmission much possible (so entering exiting building). also fact I’m working like this, I’m best limit risk everywhere else includes eating restaurants, weekend trips right now, even seeing friends person unless we’re outdoor location 6 feet apart (and helps I’m working home). states it’s life usual affects you. People business don’t care wellbeing. It’s inconvenience can’t job get sick. hard stay away idiots everywhere go, like work, grocery stores, gas stations etc... country founded rebeling authority, people rebel science common sense. Yup.

I highly encourage everyone check things like National Flood Insurance Program, Community Rating System, etc. Flood mitigation insurance crazy complicated subject.  know. I’m beyond pissed state. joe rogans world extolling Texas’ “freedoms” Trending doooooowwwwnn. Sounds like Jersey argument. wrong. Even (rapidly expedited) Russian vaccine hasn’t finished clinical trials &amp; definitely available public Yup, that's fair argument. Though perfect world disabled people would bathroom good setup help accommodate them. :( Impressive! remember reddit people use say things false positive covid tests false negatives people reddit need humble know enough virus. people need humble pie people keep saying tcells makes us immune infection still dont fully know that. That's one best things biker. socal without speak people move. joy riding taking mick mates.
Miss bike like crazy. words great David Bowie, I'm afraid Americans. go anywhere Cork American accent, I'm tend leave. Theres point country everything else right fighting virus we're going import infected country world plane load, multiple times die. 

What fucking shit show. FF FG absolute disgrace country, everyone voted them. also trust Trump far throw him, trust scientists regulatory agencies actually developing studying vaccines. EMA going deem vaccine safe Trump president. vaccine developed US approved FDA agencies, sure understand skepticism. that's going happen. Available whom? vaccine first available us personally many months us wait option getting vaccinated based hodgepodge politics, risk/benefit analysis, geography. Remember death toll 150,000 said would disappear like things disappear. - complete failure administration. Well, able get tested symptoms. work lot people contact people sick covid. would nice one asymptomatic cases. Never hoity toity, respect signal virtue. important set good examples. Yeah guess Republicans uses approach excuse incompetence. point Sweden got hit hard travel Stockholm.


But proving Stockholm gets fewer travelers Milan, Vienna, Rome proves point exactly?


Sweden 1.5 guests spending night per capita 2018

Italy 3.6 guests spending night per capita half tourism, nearly number deaths per capita. don’t know parent could look child send school. I’m kids old enough stay home without supervision it’s stopping going work. Southern Maine. time lice, meningitis, uncommon contagious disease (so cold flu) send email notification everyone.

I thought pretty common guess not.

Don't afraid complain process inadequate. people need testing results anyway? Regardless testing. Social distance, wash hands, safe. feel sick stay home. Yes. I'm interested people's diverticulitis flareups right now. shut borders instigate rolling lockdowns, really beaten? Evil genius level. Let's see, population could get together tight proximity, catch spread disease, show symptoms? Wow, tweet aged like fine scat wine... Whew laddie. Sure. Ok. weak ass virus making fool country. 10 o’clock night country road main road drive shutdown construction. nervous driving unmarked car. Let’s say didn’t get ticket much wrong know didn’t want name could reported things well(long story). upset didn’t even think look name badge wanted get situation get work. terrible? Since likely camp terrible dumb. explain intelligent optimal timing interventions differs suppression mitigation strategies, well 
depending definition optimal. However, mitigation, majority effect

healthcare capacity overwhelmed. Given systematic surveillance occurs hospital 
context, typical delay infection hospitalisation means 2- 3-week lag

Only basement dwellers Reddit would continue peddle nonsense. hear part football funds education profitable? Without football education costs more. inability understand total counts accurate measure country's response fascinating, almost never worked data life before.

Total counts good lense look through. normalize data; taking population countries question.  founded rebelling business paying tax. I’m disgusted this. expect colleagues supposedly dedicated career pursuit learning teaching. experience teacher teach, unmasked teacher would run instead.  Maybe, maybe not. actually need spread prevent healthcare system getting overwhelmed, know 100% perfect solution years come. Uh, 99.9% people effected. see happening. next generation going baby boomers again? Okay factually incorrect say US didn’t fight Europe June 1944. I’m fine people want offer different interpretations key events look conflicts various angles objective facts open interpretation. I’m curious everyone’s contact tracing/quarantining exposure looks like.

My boyfriend live together close contact hours someone tested positive. He’s instructed self quarantine I’ve told I’m fine go work long wear mask. Models show wearing mask reduces risk 50% social distancing less 25%.  Here's latest case/death charts New York, running 7-day graphs show great job New York done. every state looked like that, job would done here. mean Sweden also rebelled science? Doubly so, land crossings, flights Canada, marine vessels crossing. good portion cases Canada recently due travel USA. 
The land border mix different exceptions truckers going back &amp; forth people transiting Alaska (but going Canadian parks). Sensible people care unfortunately people certain regions people certain political affiliation inclination towards behavior allows virus propagate further. friends sound afraid super cautious, becoming deniers makes sense then. see lot women mostly blame media (tv/movies) drawn to, i.e. Law &amp; Order: SVU. highlight women victims dangerous world. believe thoughts (if covid19 real) become dark, may 180 latch onto deniers POV. Worry not. 3rd nation (US) cretinous. truly Darwinism takes accomplishes mission statement. need tougher. kid luxury ability travel across borders hang friends good time. privilege taken away crying it? Suck up. Like really. anything people becoming weaker prone complaining ANYTHING. Case point. Americans complaining wearing masks civil liberties. REALLY, really worth complaining something simple wearing mask? bunch privileged assholes see. people like support them. said that? Trump's administration approved HDQ emergency use without science back up. also happened drug Trump kept touting buying. 

We can't trust them. Pure simple, can't trust them. They've proven many ways year.

There plenty reasons this, EAU hydroxychloriquine, shady stuff posted CDC website death rates, early lies masks, fact president lies time constantly puts undue pressure top officials even calls names constantly public defy him, switching stuff away FDA like doing, constant war scientists government agencies, constant lies public misinformation, etc. stuff happen normal administration, truly scary comes trusting administration's health advice. CT scan within next couple weeks high risk, thus masks metal (1 p100 1 N95) come off. effective mask containing metal switch get ready IV scan? feel like cloth defeats purpose protecting I’m hoping find something better. can't wrap head around it. American neighbors family regurgitate sound bite rationale over. tell fed Russian propaganda swallowing whole, there's way unplug it. one, getting quite tired winning. Nope. friends there. Wish them, everyone else best.

I'm saying 9 infected cramped mess deliriously hopeful. 

The next weeks going fucking mess, damned tragedy could avoided. 

I'll surprised US cross 300k mark things ""handled"" - fucking embarassing. Americans care. busy defending one cancerous presidential hopeful other. anti-maskers. young people feel invincible. old people care anyone anything aside Medicare. rich people need make money backs poor people. corporations stole hundreds billions tax payer money. None care containing Covid. Covid great business. Seriously...

EUROPEAN ASIAN COUNTRIES tested us. don’t need fucking experiment see WORKED. Holy shit... blind ignorant people? 

I bet half cultists haven’t even stepped foot country even state lives. 

Just look Italy China way worse Feb/Mar. They’re eating dinners friends now, traveling, going work, even going clubbing now! Probably think it’s jets releasing chemicals air. Meanwhile here's latest case/death charts upward curves, I'd say mail voting would fine thing. Honestly hate say maybe it’s best. wish eu instead China, USA pretty clearly rapidly losing ground superpower. China outpacing us hard even fragmented EU lapping USA coronavirus responses far. Seein next big issue climate change USA shown it’s completely incapable stopping something understand like virus, fuck would trust us take charge lead climate response? I'd like see numbers closer 25% 50% 9f world population dying off, would good long term survival. Let's pray hit Civil War numbers. They'll likely vectors, spreading rest community....to people much higher chance dying. It’s fact population ignorant enough controlled manner disturbing. Carin said best- “Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that”. Unfortunately started downswing average intelligence is. 

I’m registered republican, two party system. I’m also staunchly anti-Trump. hedonist sees appeal. pursed lipped pussycat would entirely easy manipulate make financial gain upon. Way easy reality star, definitely fit public office much less President “free world”. eyes may permanently get stuck rolled back roll November.

Please, repub dems alike, Vote! person feasible. Looks like mail votes stalled regardless forewarning. Vote bastard out. I’m definitely shunned peers, I’d prefer Joe Biden post-lobotomy another 4 years shit. mark words, false inflation stock market gonna come crashing down. It’s gonna cripple even long term investors curtain fall many supporters. Hate it, don’t hate them. think varies feed opposite, people complaining keep shit like pissed theyre even stuck working stores open early mask mandates place. care want normal life again. taking risks shouldnt think theyll safe it/its worth risk. Itd help point people actually understood science behind transmission, masks, social distancing, virus affect short term long term...... can't enforce anything everyone gun fragile ego's. completely asinine comparison. Even extending logic perfectly clear 300,000 deaths worse 1.  Welp, that's enough internet day. mean first say wear mask tommorow government tell us wear type belt safety device driving. end next week store owners audacity post signs saying ""no shirt, shoes, service""....where end freedom?! Current ICU utilization. still wrong thread, bud. Calm cowboy, soley speaking personal experience. never claimed expert. Hence word 'seems' 'does without shadow doubt' bad maskless mouth breathers also go shopping stores. It’s election year, district campaigning. also, can’t 500 people negotiating one thing time. Thats exactly family feeling. relative died suffer horrible death alone. relieved them. That's America's brought too. *really* rooting Moderna.

Not sense nationalism, succeed, prove efficacy tech. means, essentially, 3D print vaccines based solely upon virus *data*.

That's enormous leap.

Anybody know research shortening testing phase? Advanced computer modeling, maybe? Yes. It’s interesting bawking “we dying, cant fear, freeeeeeedom”

I wonder feel sitting father’s funeral. still like quarter die every year obesity. Telling someone they’re “healthy every size” irresponsible telling someone masks don’t work. dunno enforce traffic laws somehow. always maintained cops gone beaches shot one spring breaker everyone else would gone home hundreds thousands lives could saved. it’s like, someone shot Burger King employee Orlando asking wear mask. people. dangerous one thing compared another. What's deadly: bullets explosions, weak-ass virus people get test even know it? Oh, see. means saying population density default causes disease spread. Rather, gives opportunity congregation, leads disease transmission. Places bars, churches, schools, workplaces, waiting rooms, (as mention) public transit involve people sitting indoors close quarters long periods time bulk transmission occurs, assuming uniform distribution eatablishments per capita, see congregating action large metropolitan areas, especially considering cross border travel tourists commerce. confounded harsher hygiene regulatory measures common metropolitan areas, listed among confounding variables latter studies listed.

Most transmission occurs care facilities, hospitals homes. public. homes also one wears masks... how's irony? 

Of course makes sense, since mostly short-range transmission touching infected people spreads virus. add comparing Sweden NY ideal comparison. cultural societal differences two (trust government big one). reasonable comparison Sweden neighbors, Finland Norway, experienced 10% per capita death rate Sweden. Finland Norway issued lockdowns, Sweden not.

Forget NY NYC. Even 2x bad Sweden per capita death basis. NJ CT. 

Why reasonable compare Sweden US states? EU countries outside Scandinavia?

I see reason to, pretty clear shutting everything make much difference. US going catch Sweden total deaths/capita. We're still locking opening locking opening. total waste. I'm sure governmental trust it. like there's sizable minority people US actively trying spread virus. 

I think PM Norway regretted shutting last week? Said worth end something initial fears virus misguided. Found it, ""And no, little nothing 'population density' whatever ill-contrived excuse people come claim Sweden 'fairly.' puts lot people makes people less likely engage you. admit remark similar vein, initially intent engaging directly tone post, reply prompted me.

It’s difficult problem solve, areas ignoring hoping things get better. aren’t.  Since death lagging indicator, assume deaths plateau even spike hospitlizations first start decline.

Kids really efficient spreading viruses. kids school probably experienced this! Also Sweden low [student teacher ratio USA underfunded education years.

I thought kids didn’t get virus. (Another /s, case obvious.) fleece pull masks people exercise frequently use.

I sincerely hope fatalities low seems like 2nd wave time...... Correct, plus people avoiding regular medical screenings would otherwise diagnose life threatening ailment, ultimately may cause preventable death. Fuck!  I've seen studies say 40%. 

It's complete immunity clearly NYC isnt cases despite harsh lockdowns started massive deaths. beyond infuriated. many kids going suffer long-term complications?

Alas, annual physical Friday proved very, wrong. Source? Damn idea, wonder public education horrible. Two wrongs don’t make right. NY wealthy state hopefully agree...I know executive order bullshit comes attached good, I'm tired hungry want homeless come September savings runs :(


Five weeks? fuck point then! God damnit hate country.... Barely. Infection Mortality Rate (chance die get it) 40 year old 1 10,000. someone 65 1 20. plenty obese, asthmatic, diabetic etc 40 year olds, still, odds 1 10,000. real risk factor They’re getting test results quickly? county locked 1 case today w/88k people outbreak meat factory test results back yet. know matter fact individual Alabama currently infected SARS CoV-2 week long pass Buffalo chip Sturgis. soon completes treatment Monument health, he's headed entire family also infected. like better plan good leader / communicator

as said, im looking play achievement, nations failing due willfully ignorance, science. shortly got CDC telling us buy masks won’t help you. can't point flaws want get better MOVE! I'm sure would said right founding father's faces Lincoln power. Fucking retarded. many test results getting returned 7-14 days. trust negative result long?! 😬 Start declining permanently? huge waves states hit 20%?  Dude responded three times. ok? Haha Still vote last time. Idk fishing gators, snowboarding ones would probably make great masks. They're thick trap lot moisture in, meaning dropplets getting trapped.
You'd probably end getting really hot summer though Listening experts good communicator pretty much good leader is. Six one, half dozen another. test much would fewer positive tests. mean (the parents) need kids house. purely selfish push open schools. It’s flattening curve eradicating virus. position, influence, power rely upon healthy running economy. Without schools supervise, roles become redundant, thus bringing income, authority, jurisdiction question. pull shit like order justify positions haha insane

most people knew left kids home alone grandparents. never saw issue kids turned fine. still shortage N95 masks? TP shortage. Masks also plenty time catch up. currently 23 active cases. contained, people entering country immediately quarantining. yeah, almost impossible catch here, 100% clear sick eating fatty food sign. That's signature ended getting father get out. Dunno sure. can't eat stuff all. Yes. It’s control literally everywhere US essentially. global embarrassment. Oh doubt that! 140 pounds 60 days. Aargh.

People think we're immune hardship.

Tough lesson coming. Homeschooling legal states. states minimal regulations. good time people check local laws regarding pulling kids school year. kids private summer school summer hundred kids dozen staff. isolated infections problems. Maybe asymptomatic cases? I'm actually kinda surprised caught yet. crazies ones still voting type would push back mask mandates. Even anti mask people minority, gerrymandering, voter suppression, straight corruption, minority still keeps people power.

If support mask wearing, alienate people supporting regressive corrupt party. never story woe Juliet Romeo. think going back founding father's...all I'm saying this.

For kid say blatantly,""I fucking hate country"" sounds like rant. like country, get ass, stop playing video games, get involved local politics, make difference. 

It's way easy go online, make comment, think making difference. Like said, either get involved make choice move place feel better off. 🏝️

BTW, Lincoln said this: ""Do good hate turn ill friendship.” Sure, would incentivized GOP instance? I'm saying there's solution, reform effective specifics. Many parents feel comfortable leaving elementary age children home alone day long. child welfare organizations recommend leaving children age 11-12 years old alone others say even 12 year olds left alone couple hours specifically remember send message late January saying, ""Hey gang...I think Coronavirus could thing. need talk see might want do?"" Crickets.

Don’t get wrong, perfect word use first time. thousandth time gets bit repetitive celebrate top post yet, India coming #1 way faster.. 10c increase lettuce price going lead meaningful change labor compensation.

Not mention diet American poor already woefully bereft fresh vegetables is. Price increases intensify problem. politicians incentivized right thing, problem system.

Politicians altruistic nature. hell yeah they're actively harmful. Well flu vaccine available. Covid we're quite yet. want one want microchips. People want bad news. They’re fucking losers. Viruses mutate weaker kill hosts.  hope thid mutates quickly. Yeah subtract Florida, California, Texas we're basically Europe right now.  Wow could’ve guessed new report American Academy Pediatrics finds. 97,000 children tested positive coronavirus July 16 July 30, according almost 5 million reported COVID-19 cases U.S., CBS News' Michael George reports group found 338,000 children. 


So nearly 1/3 childhood cases U.S. discovered last two weeks July.


Were testing kids July? Omg!!! Don’t give yahoos ideas- they’ll trynna shoot virus! Sort of. Estate responsible amount assets contains. still angry people saying normal flu,not bad tb influenza. people social distancing can't maintained Bill Gates spending $150 Million. Trying make billions nonsense work honor health system Arizona. dude talking ass Morons It’s economy regular life. literal President US incompetent, guys supposed do? Dept education, someone answers Trump’s cronies. 6 months slow spread every single turn US failed. Elsa Anna mask kinda cute... worry, he's promising permanently cut pay roll taxes he's reelected. Think money save sticking elderly. ^/s Thanks...I pray true! Entirely reasonable fear. Keep us we’re collectively come senses. (Which appears likely take awhile.) Considering ran face first machine gun fire WW1 claiming 'nobody lives forever', i'd say got decent shot winning. arrogance USA led covid19 hellhole. I'm sure different think even Fauci's word would me, anybody Trump direct influence over. I'm getting vaccine administered Canada and/or New Zealand No. continued program. means mistakes happen things rushed. Assuming nothing looks super dodgy I'll getting vaccine available me.

But I'm thinking something like happened today, social media world, would really blow people lead huge trouble. London, Paris, Rome, Milan, Vienna, Barcelona get tourists Stockholm. silly pretend messaging irrelevant. personal feelings broad understanding elections work. Objectively, know messaging important.

And Dems, like political parties, absolutely pay people teach win. either they're trying lose they're profoundly stupid, learn 2016. Imagine dumb enough live city rent high lol can’t wait future tell kids. “So guys fight coronavirus?”. Well it’s simple. stayed home days, toilet paper sold everywhere, days people claimed right leave house wear mask claimed hoax numbers inflated, months sent kids back school wearing face masks capability home. future kids going look like I’m lying one would ever stupid done? government? citizens country hardly say rapacious antiquated government desires.  Oh is, you’re trumpet. Nothing see folks troll. Good luck you, I’ll waiting least 6 years.

I’m trying alarmist, reason long approval period, could permanently fuck body. look dengue fever vaccine…that failed hadn’t dengue turns made susceptible it, hit harder.

Who knows else would do. mean imagine protected covid, caused flu deadly. it’s vascular disease, causes worse reaction vascular diseases. 

I’m vaccine, I’m rushed one. Remember harmless asbestos, uranium, lead, nicotine used perceived. use 737 max, they're doomed fail anyhow. kind sad thing Trump done right shelling money vaccine creators. read article day that. 

 

this part (my bold) stood out.

 Stephen Sample, rode Harley Arizona, event break routine last several months, he's mostly homebound wearing mask went work surveyor.  don’t want die, don’t want cooped life either,” said.  Sample, 66, feared could happen caught COVID-19 rally. **He said trying avoid indoor bars venues, felt risk infection greater. opening day rally, said ate breakfast indoor diner.**

&amp;#x200B;

now might reading something Sample's words there, reek someone fully intended left home wear mask, saw big boys wearing think let little bit pee out. going happen US feel. Man fucking wish nano machine era. would first get shit. Never need worry virus again. two types ways Fauci accused ""flipping"", lot us tend lump together one, even though different:

1. science actually changes, masks.
2. Politically, like sometimes done schools. One day schools open fall. Another schools stay closed.

In categories fall? early tell. don’t understand point.

My point deliberately using language that, accurate, misleads readers concluding opposite facts point to. Zach's vocals best part rage... Republicans.  anyone informed Betsy DeVos? I'm sure would like send condolence card. Lets serious, every single person posting thread kinda dodged entire war got history lessons. much stupid one comment. Go read history book. Jesus, bone cancer. fact frontline worker nothing that. going lose leg anyway. title misleading implies somehow victim overworked corona. Working long hours double shifts something nurses anyway virus virus. could happened anyone anytime matter job is. Telling I’m stupid asking I’m 12 calling “bro” really highlights you’re ability understand. Go pour bowl Cap’n Crunch turn CNN. You’re grounded. tried spending less guns meds? taiwan proving human human transmission December. good day. ;) Look actual hard data behind lockdowns, swallow popular Canada search bar.

The. Put USA. Compare mobility curves. Let know consider significant difference. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. higher chance kill parents compared viruses? Statistically disease isn’t bad people make be. actually put cars testing revealed worse-than-nothing performance vehicles would recalled air bag system replaced. would probably end news, get information many people possible, would important thing know.

And see similar current situation, like almost exactly analogous conversation having?

At least US, would think non-standard mask common say Asia, wearing mask sick common place, 1 year ago, wearing mask grocery store even something people would even think of. 

Now, people using sorts things masks, without sort testing scientific basis, like neck fleece. However, someone preformed study, found one particular mask might infective, published news effort 'recall' it, people know use different type mask.

You really stretch see parallels pointing obvious, clearly printed article, masks worse wearing sort major breakthrough, high level scientific reasoning desperately seem need be. supposed to. That's unemployment for. ECONOMIC STIMULUS. hope goes femur implant prosthetic recovered. bionic well superhero &lt;3 badass. 

Also ... Fuck Cancer... Traffic violence - esp. pedestrian cyclist deaths urban areas point go back normal? there’s vaccine it’ll don’t know vaccine effective. prove it’s effective it’ll we’re afraid next pandemic. life held hostage I’d better dead. 100%. Palliative treatments improving already. 

I’ve got season tickets Austin FC’s first season starts March, I’m extra hopeful, think that’s realistic timeline. Cheers! use sharpie random map, direct hurricane want go. Right!! almost everyone died WW2 like 30!!! Insane. Like could even compare them! Right man. Amazing mental gymnastics there. ""That shows incompetent ~~or~~ *and* liar.""

FTFY end then? vaccines silver bullet, get common cold level severity disease? 

Bill Gates gave interview said vaccine could end developed world next year 2022 developing nations, rapid vaccine (ala happened 2000) would take five years. Scary proposition, we’re lucky occurred vaccine technology robust. Oh please - cities burned down. scattered incidents caused small number idiots. One best friends lives Portland told mayhem largely restricted areas endorsed majority law-abiding citizens. plenty reports right-wing idiots similarly destructive things, reported Fox, Breitbart pick poison. heard Boogaloo Boys? extreme get. attempt paint lefties problem woefully inadequate. extremists across ideological spectrum, tout god, guns violent actions. call equal opportunity extremism. feelings wrong behave recklessly would wrong. experts could warned us this. there's nothing then... countries back yard problems, definitely makes problem. knew anything economy would see economies connected. Yea make sense. maintain illusion self control following guidelines. feel safe still going masking, using sanitizer. 

There's got going here. people refuse thing would protect give control. Why? going teach kids teachers 1. Quarantined bc exposure 2. ill/hospitalized/dead 3. Retired/quit don’t get ? Plus kids asymptotic, many kids permanent lung/heart/brain issues? many die? many many? One kid dead many me. this? niece teacher; work cause kids like eat, live house, etc. asked kids attending school. reply virtual lessons home Nonny. using kids guinea pigs!! Interesting. wonder new guidance then. that's true, 6ft might enough indoors, rethink ventilation strategies. Beat it, I'm ""pro-lifer"". Literally one would win war, including US. US went war without allies every first world power everyone would fucked. Russia would likely ally would probably join axis evil hedge bet continue make US look terrible international sphere. wish constituents knew this.

It would lot easier move forward everyone page. least they’re outdoors. hope means won’t many cases this. really easy way around this, shell money. people trying pay rent, also landlords trying pay mortgage, people arent paying rent, banks take houses. Overweight, middle-aged stupid.

SARS-CoVs important customer base. really appreciate info gives hope future...I'm looking Worldometer charts seems like European countries virus control. However, countries like France Spain seem uptick last week so. happening getting close 20% seroprevalence? yet? confusing appropriation allocation. That's heard well. Instead $600, going around $400 believe, either way, it'll help millions people. Coronavirus hoax it’s dangerous election. Vote! stages grief thing load bollocks- even people came thought while. Ladies gentlemen, present argument mature academic! /s aware country chose compare US paragon wisdom currently carrying ethnocide Uighurs right?

Sandy Hook, debate gun control essentially over. horrific event shake us stupor, nothing will.  throbbing eggplant terms protecting exposure, seems important part mask-wearing FIDDLE mask. Put properly, leave on, don’t constantly touch adjust it, take off, assume it’s possibly contaminated virus outside carefully remove wash hands. main concern neck gaiters seems people constantly pulling therefore theoretically smearing virus outside fabric neck face day??? Family friend doctor prison. know where. forbidden wear mask prison officials want prisoners scared coronavirus. able find another position problem, suspect difficult time replacing him. Weird choice comment removal, automod. think missed main offender. don’t know. think people around many people every day, traveling many places. Teachers, medical professional, retail workers, business people, etc. many people almost required vaccination employer work. guess anyways. Don’t know mandated would think people naturally wouldn’t want spread anything customers, clients, etc may predisposed getting vaccine livelihoods depend it. two cents ... poster edited post quoted without acknowledging edit post. hard see happened. No, educational. make everything emotional issue. Well, site actually became site referring r/covid19. Apparently site drew much anecodtal information, rumours, etc proof provided turned regular message board discuss relevant issues pass along similar news subs, r/covid19 go-to sub want strict BS news discussion virus.

Be forewarned though - dry, scientific BS. Canadian 

Then give shit? Mind fucking biz That's _single pictures._ show single pictures police violence too. get waffle iron. waffle anything. back beginning January, started hoarding 3M N95 respirators.(okay, two 10-packs bought local Lowe's store) 

that week, also went doctor check-up. telling respirators bought. Remember, around beginning January. looked like crazy something.  said thousands people died year flu.... nothing worry about.

Well.... since then, thing changed... :( Haha yeah gonna say wrong tag. kills children? BLM movement part life, that’s expected, need fight equality all. add protesting militarized police ( badges) list. testing bill? tests supposed free? even must universal healthcare. actual direct quote, Dr Fauci included eat-in restaurants. logistics going airports hate. plane bad. Right, 300,000 cleanly equally representative Americans. people high risk people low risk. Low risk people might fear botched vaccine bout COVID. work like unfortunately. Even though COVID19 stable, still mutate strains cause reinfection. Thanks this. idea I'll reading Greed entire point capitalism. didn’t like idea extreme greed, would never advocate capitalism Recently I've seen reports studies,that exposure regular coronavirus confer immunity people. case, purposefully expose multiple people coronavirus hoping induce partial full immune response therefore inducing herd immunity. great ideas, get wrong. can't put bombs planes already fly hurricanes blow up? anything nuclear, that's crazy much fallout coming ashore maybe really big MOAB?

This started satire lol I'm curious effect *very large* white phosphorous explosion either eye multiple points along eye wall. could argue lockdown caught it. New metastudy showed recently presymptomatic. 20% remains asymptomatic. nice chimps mean using anger guiding principle? It’s interesting would even work? people aren’t Christians. think are, aren’t. Dear Midwest - actually stoppable. need entitled idiot. Wear mask, social distance, stay home weeks. 

Sincerely, Northeast (especially New York City) I'm already losing friends put temporary stop family communications it. people would consider otherwise smart. imagine hearing SO. 

I recently lost someone close due covid-19 good thing work home social distance anger feel people spout shit fear might become physical. stupid though, even like this. take ""remote-first"" position schools, start making exceptions in-person needed/available.

Because absolute intensity disease caused virus, prudent thing take every action protect contracting it. 

After all, pandemic started didn’t know much - learn go, catch year learn everyone’s nose falls 14 months infection ... well, late.

Obviously silly example, realistic examples scary consider. need consider enough motivate take seriously. one would go line thinking. *Obviously* meant properly hypothetical safe tested vaccine magically came today available all, would take it?

Granted, people already warping death GA’s 7 year old died week wasn’t Covid, kid died seizure drowned bathtub... seizure caused Covid. also death wish  It’s already 50. tests take long time turn around. goddamn shit. 1. death rate isn’t deaths total cases. It’s deaths recovered cases. death rate doesn’t account people yet die.
2. also spreading teachers, staff, janitors, parents, grandparents, students more. It’s kids dying, it’s everyone else well.  federal student loans, right? private ones? part day doom-scrolling, ruin positivity. 1- poor man’s death unrelated schools open. died community transmission already happening 
2- kids school cease exist. go daycare, go neighbor’s, go grandma’s care.
3- schools provide essential public health function daycares not, addition education that, again, daycares cannot provide. 

If you’re side science, believe wearing mask, claim listen experts - must open schools heavily hit areas. Open schools save lives. Titus Quinctius Flamininus Check stupid ask link, math wrong op. Debt dies debtor US. transfer someone else. Even marriage states, debt before(key word) marriage can't passed new spouse. Yah, seriously doubt 100 million people get shown safe effectual. positivity rate lower? terrible. Yeah $22 hour 20 hours technically wage-wise $11 hour. $440 week taxes. Barely pays rent cities.

This found case spent time work. also noted Swedens cases started dropping dramatically right start summer holidays(which start 10th June, cases started dropping towards end June) many swedes take 4 weeks work go summer houses. think fall/autumn telling Sweden really doing. expensive would remote schooling be? cheap laptop cut it? heard criteria mentioned repeatedly - given don’t understand virus all, sure seems like haphazard way go this. point straight murder. Let state spider-like nanomachines see movies PURE FICTION CURRENTLY EXIST. 

So want start unrealistic conspiracy, little research. currently even working intravenous nanomachines. plot device writers get stuck science fiction genre. got many people/kids close, constant proximity, regular basis, even mask mandate becomes useless. one coming ahead scenario. good analogy!

The benefit cheap, people excreted body waste would end water supply many places due poor sanitation. Like cholera stuff spreads, spreading beneficial version polio would turn innoculate people.

Far less recovered hospitals. 40 250 regions Sweden IVO found [Palliative care introduced start pandemic using general assessment rather individual prescribe treatment nursing homes. 91 1700 nursing homes IVO found serious reports mishandlings going in-depth medical records review patient. also point many regions geriatric departments outside-of-emergency-hospital-care wards prepared assigned accept end-of-life patients (as one hospice normally would) also general elderly patients treated oxygen on. Maybe 80% comes geriatric department best hospital Stockholm released numbers start May? departments state patients sent nursing homes even referral cases empty beds (not even ICU, geriatric care). gonna investigated part larger government comission investigation handling pandemic. 

I argue mishandlings cases gonna criminal medical negligence. argue people push organized government-level policy happened around Sweden. ""measures"" Croatia show, life going completely normally GF let buy one, I'll cool get Harley Davidson cap windbreaker. China long time tried overtake USA hegemon subcontinent, Covid gave another opportunity advance objective. However, say aid ever really important region, coronavirus-related aid also significant now. Yes?

It's still weird watch kill base. honestly good news rest us. get Covid-19 die see fit, we’ll able get vaccine sooner must touch position privilege able think working class person’s job essential family. That's 42% votes Trump. don’t say say old fat.... realize vast majority US ""fat"" according medical definition right? sure need wait know sure. Interesting hear vaccine expert without skin game way Fauci, Redfield, government employees do. hear different things really good know. Crime way up. Especially shootings. horrible. going get worse $600 week checks stop. Currently covid numbers increasing Chicago. However, fomite transmission considered likely mode transmission SARS-CoV-2 accounts believe approximately 20% infections.

So take-away comment *possible* catch covid touching infected surface, infections come sources (e.g. sharing airspace infected person)? That's i'm trying figure out. large percent athletes tend drop like flies various reasons( i.e doping,lack resting, underlying health issues checked etc.). Covid could well accelerate already existing health problems. certain based information article provides us. Covid might even role know. might even accelerated underlying health issue created new one. article told us straightly try link covid man shady title would reliable news source tbh. happened all. usage masks downplayed. people collective blackout watch news? USA, countries originally played usage masks West. Canada too. UK. even admitted interview. Stating PPE short supply downplayed lying. Ignoring fact people dead WH push. Sorry friend seems expericing denial. 

What context projecting think referring? posted photo mask stadium. suggest this. game. That's it. 

Was drinking water photo taken? proof another photo? seems like hands occupied drinking water. make moral judgement part. make assumptions took seconds, otherwise sound like making excuses without knowing. that, makes come across biased. think theres vaccine, likely outcome.

But, social isolation hard ppl...especially mental health.

Also, reading bc many ppl unemployed, states collect less taxes severe revenue shortfalls. like shutting businesses consequences... Know Irma... 10 day old baby 3 dogs. WOW. LOL. Seriously? mask defeating. God forbid ever ride motorcycle wear face covering prevent bugs, live cold climate wear scarf face time outdoors, work construction wear mask day prevent dust getting lungs... Far “unstoppable”, least according Dr Fauci addressed Brown University’s School Public Health week:

“Fauci said six fundamental principles people follow decrease curve cases:

Universal wearing mask
Physical distancing
Avoiding crowds

Thank you! people China wear mask allowed street It’s unbelievably frustrating watch US bungle badly. kids sounds like hassle. course. think said Canada?

Oh, no, see, places offer vacation time still require get time request approved management. get approved enough coverage cover duties one else currently trying take vacation time. Even then, really supervisor's whims tell dates chose work submit request different day/time instead. repeatedly get work year never time approved.

Many companies also ""use lose it"" vacation policy, instead rolling unused vacation hours end calendar year, simply lose them. super lucky company might let ""cash out"" vacation time lieu taking time work. get bonus check week's pay stead time off. Companies allow roll-over vacation time put limit long allowed gone position get fired, regardless much paid time may stockpiled.  look original research, study noted significant differences patients recovery less 2 months one recovery 3 months, presume heart healing happening super quick.

Sure, nothing person person still expecting them, given hard insist pandemic ""liberal hoax"" Wow wonder caused 9 cases /s think get soon can. I'm older issues would probably kill get virus. extra guinea pig others. problems vaccine alive year two, maybe others encouraged. Fuck you, Americans every right hate America Here's better way explain it.

Both corona. show symptoms. go get tested boom, comes back positive. Corona. symptoms. dont get tested feel fine. die. Bam Corona 100% mortality rate! No, im fine survived. 50% mortality rate scenario. imagine someone came along said ""Corona! 100% killer among tested"" thats accurate actually dangerous decisions get made based false data. 100% doesnt good except cause fear. Clearly not, would fucking done now. 

Instead repeat months end hope someone give attention. ~20% reported cases develop breathing problems, require hospitalization. 20% go hospital, evident many actually show hospital many die home. Hospitalizations vary region well. I'm Dallas, 13% hospitalization rate reported cases. I've seen study early pandemic CDC showing 14% hospitalizations (I can't find link now, sadly). link confusing many people: Counting strong suit part country. administrator fired replaced professional cares safety less censorship. Ok, I’m glad see expanding challenge COVID-19 initial comment came from. 
Most kids teenage years want spend time away parents instead friends. 
I 8 5 year old - still think great mom. 
In fact, daughter actually said enjoying pandemic one angle doesn’t play people every day. 
My son end social spectrum happy able see friends. 

Luckily though, don’t even really talk kids much interaction people. 
I explained March virus spreads relatable terms, give reminders along way whole followed direction. 
If already teenagers, extra hormones / rebellious nature / physical ability think would make things tougher. 
I guess reason say prepare type young adult be. US. Canada every province said kids go back social distancing, class size reduction, mandatory masks (for younger kids anyway). I'm furious. far province offered online options. husband realize need keep kids home, reduce working hours try get less money... figure homeschool. Given study even epigenetic (!) analysis virus infected person, think one could say investigation quite thorough. nothing else, it’s fascinatingly detailed haven’t read already.

Have watched Danny McBride's Vice Principals? damn GOOD. McBride Coggins play ultimate school admins... Well ideal world taking years study effects potentially thousands participants ideal, guess middle pandemic less ideal take years? Certainly every parent. live 170 kids elementary school. I'd say least half planning homeschool unless governments plans change, live area low infection rate. I'm heartbroken send kids back school, know quickly viruses spread around school small community. safe. Isolation isn’t something treated flippantly seem think be. Especially imposed people without consultation.

Many people died die without spending time loved ones again. median time spent nursing home death 5 months. can’t imagine gave many people choice never loved ones ever again, lower chance getting C-19 spending time loved ones limited time left, higher chance contracting C-19, hard time imagining many would choose isolation.

At age, isn’t much do, time loved ones pretty much thing meaning lives. empathy. heard worker inside one conditions like lockdown.

However, fomite transmission considered likely mode transmission SARS-CoV-2 accounts believe approximately 20% infections. schools allowed velcro.

See: sturgis Actually can't. takes around 5 days cases begin appear detectable. means kids infected before.  Well one, peak going deaths hospitalizations. Thats americans literally breathing one another. 

Whats next ? 

Also, mexico brazil deaths. Holy fucking hell. Long one ahead TL;DR is: learn basic statics, critical thinking, reading past 5th grade level might also help infected 25 deaths 0.00739% death rate that’s heavily favoring testing kids symptomatic enough get tested, means it’s even lower.

338k total confirmed infections. 25 children dead July 25 children died coronavirus **in July alone**.

See last part bold you? almost 5 million reported COVID-19 cases U.S., CBS News’ Michael George reports group found 338,000 children. 

I swear it’s like people can’t even read. shows type education kids getting here. Practically verge illiteracy...definitely worth corona getting even control get schools open! really don’t think children infected compelling argument keeping schools closed.

You couldn’t even read single page article though; clearly don’t understand statistics either since you’re comparing deaths single month confirmed cases entirely pandemic. Finally don’t even bother take time see numbers you’re spewing based reality. really don’t think understand idea compelling argument **at there’s gotta different arguments imo.

There is. argument they’re going pick spreads like wildfires schools they’ll bring home people much susceptible. Causing even stress medical system, turn deaths avoidable less stressed system capacity handle many patients. 

Your “death rate” would CFR means basically nothing like said: it’s confirmed Deaths/confirmed cases. Many kids contracted covid 338k, likely several times that. sort mortality calculation numbers problematic. [Especially wrong death numbers 

15 dead 1y

10 dead 1-4yo 

20 dead 5-15yo

225 dead 15-24yo (no, 24yo aren’t children, CDC categorizes.) 

That’s little 25 dead kids huh? Remember vast majority schools closed, kids around exponentially people school. data potential backlog two months... It’s extremely likely 25 dead July haven’t even added CDC numbers deaths reported table total number deaths received coded date analysis, represent deaths occurred period. **Data period incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more.**

And finally wonderful point made: number looks huge, virus really isn’t dangerous kids. flu actually much dangerous. kids every school year die flu way less cases. Legitimately.

That chart shows flu deaths well. easily accessible public data. guess shows? *legitimately*:

Under 1: 
14 flu deaths, 15 covid

1-4yo:
41 flu deaths, 10 covid 

5-14yo:
50 flu deaths, 20 covid

15-24yo:
52 flu deaths, 225 covid.

The difference minimal. deadly infants far, 1-4yo basically young even schools. 5-14 shows elementary middle schoolers better time terms mortality doesn’t mean they’re picking bringing home (which main issue). finally 15-24yo much worse comparison flu numbers. 

No, CoVID doesn’t kill kids insane rates. point agree dismissing saying “the flu worse” shows don’t understand bigger picture is, rest reply points towards understanding lot general...

They’re little virus vectors catching spreading disease; they’ll bring state closer point close again, hurting economy even more, what? Public schools glorified babysitters. Like covid one biggest events century education system led us? country people like yourself: can’t read article, can’t understand basic statistics, can’t find data you’re actually talking about, zero semblance critical thinking skills yet feel need voice opinion don’t care say thought process behind whatsoever.

Absolutely appalling response government leaders: lack leadership, lack focus, inconsistent communication, politicization degree beyond incompetence well maliciousness. Sure, going bother see username trolling. Face it, whole political system farce USA. think organizations get pass either many complicit. Can't recommend enough right get outdoors regularly go walks. Get fitness tracking app record distance time. See walk 15 minute mile. natural source vitamin sun exercise shaping vital organs best defense right now. month may jogging mile. many reasons. think evolution/ natural selection going here, seen along time. 

Like careful wear mask chance getting-spreading super low. Sad people end literally killing innocent people reckless. entirely reasonable one, too. sort person would vacation internationally middle pandemic, especially given US response, _exactly_ sort person concerned about.

I took 40H vacation time last month ""use lose it"" clear it'll expire vaccine available  &amp; enough doses administered travel reasonable proposal. spent driving around national forest roads exploring &amp; hiking logging roads, ""normal"" vacation activities would grossly irresponsible right now. Uh, no? plenty studies there, especially lower quality masks. Exactly. time lows. last years seen lowest homicide numbers since started keeping track. rate could 6x 2019 would still lower 1992 rate. 1 15,000+ sounds bad. bad 1 100 though. say MUCH better? Aside domestic manufacturing sure true. ( well polit preocc trying knife much) bring good point. Charts people show demonstrate US cases often leave Brazil line catching up. think would bolster argument countries ruled right wing populists deny severity disease show poor outcomes. I'll take one bedazzled gas mask please.  US extra deaths 2020? would put us comfortably 200K already 80% COVID. There's temporary UBI. withdraw something like that? 

You can't make universal, people different needs today. can't base people's current needs that's cementing current status rest life. Squares rectangles! True Americans believe constitution independence, fear porn. Gtfoh. stopping better stopping none? Sheesh. Yeaaaaa Boooooiiiii particular moment, perhaps. certainly past one immediate future. 

So go back work feel must healthcare, still choice whether LEARN this. things get little bit better conveniently forget fact current system forced risk family, still made choice. good one, viewpoint, choice same. Drums deep. *They coming* see another stimulus check coming, like 20th time I've seen video/article saying there's going another one past month.  difference endangering lives others. burn victims, would say fires/burns? minority. soooo many ignorant people country. depends body test.

Many individual states done commendable job, without centralized, organized plan beating virus rather 50 different petri dishes, much improvement made. haven’t even gotten first one alone tells don’t plan sending more. like two months make sure overwhelming majority cases play (like New Zealand did), yeah. could past back normal life, recovering everything. no, 40% population selfish pricks. No, Americans care. ignorant, self important, conspiracy theorists live bubble part sort national death cult. Source: I'm American.  UK majority.

The fear mongering propaganda what’s undeniable here. Literally everywhere read “it’s hoax” “it’s conspiracy” “we need get life”. subreddit seems intellectual people it. uk/social media convinced it’s it’s big deal One biggest aspects intelligence able navigate problem never encountered based experiences others.

We ample evidence happens pandemics history countries.

Pandemic guidelines Obama established followed would saved us much unnecessary death, president persimmon refused even look I'm whose name it.

So least certain portions tragedy absolutely falls upon shoulders ignorant Republicans.

Another aspect intelligence verifying things people tell you, something hardly Republican personally know talked social media ever bothered try.

__And way, that's is. mine, worthless opinions. really anything positive here, reason really want continue longer. win.__ move fucking colleges online only. ridiculous. opinion, money-grab college administrations pure simple. colleges “open” snagging many kids possible they’ll stay open long enough can’t get full refund back them. they’ll fight keep every nickel, come lawsuits. There’s fucking way colleges stay open fall winter. None. They’ll hotbeds coronavirus. read articles like this, recall work previous day store. Packs families, mulitple sneezing, yelling, coughing kids. kids running place, groups sent dirty restrooms, leaving uneaten food, drinks, used napkins everywhere. Hands mouths, eyes, noses merchandise. Shows every day American kids going behave hygienically school setting. even dragged shopping, one stop that.  Amen Imagine world rush vaccine find year horrific delayed side effects. don’t know I’m ready Anti-Vaxers smug That’s funny. Don’t slaves there? Wonder need volunteers then. sources reporting increased cases, posters celebrated problem believing it. 

Sure, suspect confesses crime, chances believe them. say it, less credible. thing Georgia doofs trying cover lack masking school. think cheering mention (I see cheering per se) cases turning up, rather deniers liars exposed. certainly hope result shut school down, since opened. yeah, high case counts (one hopes) silver lining helping get incompetents thrown positions authority. something cheer about, even illnesses deaths Even mistakes made, cases going go point. posters never accept they're rooting maximum death misery.

It's hard say cases go down, least mass vaccination. Even decrease, millions people long term health problems surviving infection. uncertainty vaccine effectiveness (it never 100%), anti-vax idiots, precautions like masks required years followed, virus stay population. virus keep mutating, possibly requiring seasonal vaccines boosters like flu vaccines. Good luck getting everyone keep up.

I've never really noticed issue hypocrisy. wanted chime let know Floridian stuck inside. feel way sometimes, nice reminded least us taking seriously. seems like everyone know taking vacation right now. fairly smart camping, going hotspot places like TN, taking cross country road trips, going south FL, etc. feel like never going get control. Montreal like least French city Quebec. What's plan people start dying absolutely good. 

This science-denier sub. That’s like saying , “explain vaccination science anti-vaxxer”. 

The effective thing shame move on. enough shame, won’t change opinion, they’ll stop posting wrong information shame acts negative reinforcement. 

We’ve successfully applying method limit reach science deniers years. But, real question would masks worked stop progression? Remember, virus particles far smaller bacteria. actually 1/100th - 1/1000th size human cell. That's quite small. Scientific research shown best triple layer cloth masks proper sealing face best 80% effective. single layer cloth mask without complete sealing around nose mouth (which 60% less effective. cases, like simple blue dust masks, efficiency low 1-10%. thoughts this?

Thank you! makes feel better getting it. Sincerely,
The Hypocritical Level  Tabernac...  Yeah, like measles, mumps, rubella, influenza, polio, HPV, etc etc etc. doesn’t need go away life return normal. Going movies great “date night” activity, also huge fun family / friends, don’t see disappearing. vaccine better unified response (hopefully deaths eventually bring recalcitrant fold) terms masks distancing eating/drinking ... cinemas doable again. Might take five years though 😷 Again, completing ignoring fact table children taken away instead choosing argue minutiae whether child take care given situation, entirely different discussion (and yes, hear saying personally agree majority it, also understand completely irrelevant discussion right now).

In context, I'm looking reality choices situation provides, coulda, shoulda, woulda existence right now. would like US universal healthcare. would like people able stay home pandemic tax dollars going people stay homes. would like people wear masks. Honestly, would like lot things right now, stop people make choice situation faced right without things would like would like available them.

That's empathy understanding situation comes play. Must Soros. kid's camp closed summer. Theres many good people struggling need empathy help instead. assholes wasting mental bandwith. used smoke, started giving panic attacks. Weed affects everyone differently ""someone"" top said hoax. good church folks around grabbed onto ""'it's mark beast.' told co-worker ""It's insert chip me, know, mark beast, I'm that, I'll take chances."" {facepalm} Okay, dude, stay away me.... indoctrinated, believe ANYTHING told. Sad. believe priority setter sure one could seen coming? What? let dumbest people history people elect “important people”.

Then shit like happens.

Because matter much “politics bores me” US, truth always politics kill whether you’re interested not.

This lesson half country likes sit elections. hope horizon vaccine 

An antiviral would completely eliminate economic effects virus. cares get don't...wear masks don't...social distance don't? ability reliably consistently destroy virus inside body simply taking pill pandemic instantly resolved take many years needed test vaccines prevent getting it. strange reason people expect better. Paywall, anyone care post key points?

Latin America needs help get right now. lot things tiring. build character develop discipline. still follow rules. know hold another month, think will. process adapting. Buy stuff helps, move things around room quarantine things need 3 days, etc. need unsuspend kid shared truth.. let mask wearing example us. always case hero gets suspended fools carry Yeah would probably test negative hour later. gives shit anymore following early Trump stuff Mooch, expected.

USA decline, need focus becoming third world country instead uhm whatever doing. We'd answers vaccine much sooner could return normality, people willing put lives line greater good allowed long fully understand they're doing. necessary risk. Coronavirus deaths US compare past deaths due wars (WW Ii, Vietnam war, Korean War)? wonder future impact US loss people Coronavirus. Yeah, compare illegal abortion countries! Wha expect flu shot, get scared afterwards: people, sure, get soreness arm shot was. Next day feels like someone punched arm, feels like bruise. like broken bone kind pain, nothing severe, kind dull ache move it. wears day two fine far better getting flu. 

Some folks get little bit flu-type mini-reaction, get low fever day, generally feel ""meh"". also reasons avoid shot mean ave flu complications; body's building immunity, like supposed to. 

And course millions get really notice anything all, there's that. want talk I'm around, mostly want reassure flu shot 20 years mean different experience. right thing! 

Just remind normal bit scary unpleasant, that's right. get every year dislike amount time, get that's that. Anyone non paywall link? I’d like know wording questionnaire. suspect headline might bit misleading. Perhaps 42% said would get it, 25% said would get long doctor told safe something along line. That's actually fairly common saying military government. bad saying itself, simply means look situation instead blaming people let's focus solutions. 

The problem one caused many problems say indication tone deaf hypocrisy lack concern. He's basically saying blame accept situation press find solution. bullshit. live Rapid City (about 25 miles Sturgis) largest city area, get bikers coming staying Rally. absolutely adopted bunker mentality.

Absentee ballots go month election. 

Slow mail take 3 weeks delivered 3 weeks return, ballots count many (swing) states use received date rather postmarked states. know that's true, though. guess, like lot things COVID. high numbers observed asymptomatic cases may mean good percentage people already effective immunity begin with. Long term immunity coming play short term, either. do, it’s never enough avoid surprises. Like thunderstorm coming want shut immediately, surprise! need update that’s going take 5 minutes absolutely don’t right now! Good luck! think new plan this: allow mail voting, discourage heavily every conservative media channel. create partisan slant methods voting, Republicans vote person, Democrats mail. 3 things happen. 

1) significant portions mail vote ruled ineligible whatever reason (not filled properly, matching signature, etc). true person votes. 

2) Disrupt mail service enough delay/lose mail votes non trivial margin. 

3) election night results (and exit polls) heavily favor republican candidates, setting late democratic surges challenged fraudulent votes finally trickle in, assuming steps 1 2 didn’t sufficiently tip margin republican favor. There's difference ""pro-vax"" long proven vaccines wanting make sure many, many vaccines novel virus produced, tested, (likely) approved faster ever historically done safe long term.

For example, work 3 different Covid hospital units. I've seen generally gets sickest disease. think odds me, personally, affected long term bad vaccine higher chances long term consequences Covid-19.

Will end getting vaccine? Yes. wait see experts vaccine field explain feel rushed vaccines safe, backing data. sane, science respecting American traveling right now. Well could changed country name Brazil India. 

/s  point US catering demographic people regardless whether group majority not, almost always yielded negative effect country.

The majority represented, done respecting constitutional rights minority. seriously understand people looking though zero sum game. bikers constitutional legal right town majority people live want to. However, US citizens legal constitutional right face workplace/government backed discrimination - regardless whether majority people agree not. 

Once again, represent majority people without violating constitutional rights people.
It's *really, really* hard. 

On personal note: Racial segregation wrong. Gathering 250,000+ people small town (with population 7,000) pandemic, spreading deadly virus that's killed 162,000 Americans (so far) also wrong. can't see that, bless heart. Interesting, feel way, especially vaccines expected approved month/two months/november Watch federal government confiscate masks schools. Good know America alone. Wait minute, isn't. cases hospitalizations deaths falling US compared 2 weeks ago, looks like Canada picking back understand this, actions harm two groups people: 

1. people expose virus, 
2. health care workers, inside circle #1, Venn diagram.  think happens Indians know diseases such, still living diseases almost extinct elsewhere Dr. Fauci mid-July: think I've seen source suggesting immunity period days. People suggesting multiple months, minimum.

From Dr. Fauci mid-July: think I've seen source suggesting immunity period days. People suggesting multiple months, minimum. Nicotine still danger. Less dangerous cigarettes, still increases likelihood myriad issues. Ehh, Sturgis small enough town time nothing really happens. one really imagined going thing. do---omer sub seek help stop thinking weak virus 24/7. also wrong immediately dismiss deaths occuring 3 months test. Broadway star died hospital coma 90 days death. one say die covid 90 days. 

I read wanted put ridiculously low arbitrary timeline covid. 


This bs tho...they way undercounting counting many deaths thinks like pnumonia. number counting likely pales comparison undercounting. Conservatives don’t believe countries control. myopic think US can’t control it, countries can’t either lying numbers. Trump hinted Axios interview. Everyone going get die already that.  not, deluded think death toll report daily misleading.


We far less serious/critical cases Germany, Spain France yet reporting far daily deaths. adding up. Locked comments getting political. 8 days optimal, 3 days showing symptoms, 20% false negative rate. Here's [medical journal getting test right away almost guarantees false negative “I understand you’re saying, people need hear positive thinking. past five months, it’s been, ‘The virus totally control.’ cases going deaths going up. You’ve saying it’s control.”

Trump: “Look, look, nobody knew thing about. never happened before. 1917, totally different, flu case. 1917 – there’s never anything like this. way, watch fake news television, don’t even talk it, 188 countries right suffering. Some, proportionately, far greater are.”

Swan: “Very worse.”

Trump: “Some, proportionately, greater are. Right now, right now, Spain big spike. tremendous problems world. look Moscow, look what’s going Moscow. Look Brazil. Look countries, what’s going on. sent us China, one way other, we’re never going forget it. Believe me, we’re never going forget it. beating China every single point. beating trade. making progress like nobody’s ever made progress. had, pandemic, worst year, Jonathan, they’d 67 years. know that. tariffs everything else did.”

I’m chopping monologue tariffs here, don’t day wasn’t particularly relevant discussion hand.

Trump: “Then sudden, game changed. close down. closed greatest economy ever history. then, closed down. we’re opening it. saved, way, closing it, saved millions lives. would gone herd (immunity), knew little disease, would gone herd, would lost millions people. Millions people. One person’s much. We’re 140,000 people. One person much. We’re 140,000. would lost millions people. people really understand it, really understand it, said it’s incredible, job we’ve done. ”

Swan: “Who says that?”

Trump: “Again, ban, banning China coming in-”

Swan: “But already here. already here. time banned China, came Europe.”

Trump: “Nobody knew extent. Nobody knew contagious was.”
   context pretty weird though. I'm cop myself, defending cop probably bad-cop. read national news police shooting unarmed black people here, know clearly problem elsewhere country (and shows statistics). Police shooting anyone rare always 100% justifiable situation (and statistics showing black people state killed police past decade).

Likewise, doubt places country police wear masks manner politically charged, whole country. U.S. Northeast, even cities controversy police's use force still broadly masking up.

I sincere doubts bad cops described would reddit lamenting wear masks. Yep. kind decision principals make. Things like discipline students, etc. he’s probably informed school board opens school finds new job. dont miss one fucking bit. mini USA brexit covid. warnings yet lock claiming herd immunity would save them. biggest slump g7; around 21% even Italy proper shutdown reduced 12%. death rate absolute nuts yet no-one bringing up. disgrace. place going dogs... Yeah, enough data. run around claim thing that's not... um... evidence based medicine... right? Please don’t let couple years. dream honeymoon planned summer devastated canceling it. want get much sooner later. (But intention going it’s safe) Holy shit, least SOMEONE got it. downvotes peak 2020 They're already getting since last big event, Days 76 rodeo, starting manifest spike cases. Said rodeo held masks social distancing old small stadium. governor encouraged people attend. Cases riding sharply since. county basically control that. Like, guess don’t live Vancouver, don’t know level “acting like it’s over” like.

For me, things returning normal. I’m acting like it’s (I’m going crowded parties, sporting events, wear mask Indoors)..... I’m also perfectly social distancing - bubble isn’t 10 people, went visit friends family socially distanced day, went drink bar day. It’s perfect, I’m comfortable I’m handling pandemic. semen demons aren’t sexy led believe animes vaccine month serious doubts another shutdown. Unless think vaccine never happening

Dang, wonder downvoted, feel confident vaccine say laughable. You’re one blinders on, proof, calling anything doesn’t fit personal tin-foil-hat paradigm, fake conspiracy nonsense. live real world. 

Your continued spouting falsehoods nothing back suggests you’re likely troll. recognize people concerns feel valid like hostile thread pissing . going get vaccine available me, contractually obliged university. Beyond protect people help us (or at-least myself) get back life miss. let preface rest comment fact I'm medical doctor epidemiologist I'm sure many thread anyways.

**But Rushed:** rushing making financially viable companies move ahead without risking monetary loss event vaccine viable. top oxford vaccine, possibly others, based attempted MERS/SARS vaccines gave diseases particularly pressing. Society effectively got shut disease relatively low (but still serious) death toll. doubt people trying get us back track willing accidentally drop something dangerous onto public

**There's enough time know effects:** one's available gone required testing. time likely going get already given priority recipients months. vaccine really long term effects take lifetime notice anyways. (From NONPROFESSIONAL, ARMCHAIR, background feel like scientific understanding allows risk long term effects really low)

**I trust trump give us safe vaccine:** probably hate Trump next guy, hell next 10 guys, fortunately he's charge approving vaccine FDA CDC state health agency's are. FDA [warns using medicine touted Dr.Fauci others afraid contradict trump name science. that's enough countries drug regulating agencies independent Trump U.S. government.

while understand people legitimate concerns hard trust government right now. Taking safe effective Vaccine great way limit death toll Covid get us back things love do. anti-vaxxers suddenly believe lot crazy shit. starts seemingly realistic, scientifically unsupported concerns.

I want come combative hostile Isolation really rough hard watch people complain others listening science making pandemic political thing. Good luck! know others won’t thinking never vaccine anything lasts month.  really hope I'm wrong. greatest country history

Narrator: wasn't. Exactly here. still access email I’ve removed mailings. decided suspend girl posting picture proceeded threaten others thing. wants use fear silence students. small, small percentage normal load, less holiday mail. 

It's intentionally sabotaged right now. Postmaster General admitted oath. 

So stop useful stooge, please. point happen, choice shut America reset. planning opened cities hoard save money live shuts again. stupid people spending instead saving literally giving away survival money. mandatory lockdown corporations reach quota money live year shutdown. save it’s fLU comments stuff unique Covid. 

You realize flu, million viruses, also easily spread densely populated areas, right? saying need shutdown. [The FDA refuted Trump's claims US now. It’s paranoia concern unreasonable. roll eyes cited article Atlantic ignored, lol. rolled eyes article written lawyer specializes public health wrote US equipped handle pandemic national level die way public health services localized via thousands different branches. called BS. 

Anyone contribute Atlantic. Author matters here. Ed Yong kind expertise here, opinion piece relevant. least, relevant piece written public health lawyer wrote public health laws. 

🙄 mean weird. I'd upset dad murdered died disease lmao im making fun people denying fact bunch rice farmers beat US Hell, people can't even read articles Please explain tried quote CFR percentage can't ""figure out""? CFR flawed statistic. designed flawed statistic. CFR's fault. take account uncounted infections uncounted deaths (of firmly believe US experienced 200k+)

You think I'm enemy believe 1% real IFR, read rest message realize I'm not. like COVID-19 *report* surge. Alberta tries hard emulate states surprise all. say confidence born family settled long time ago. Big pay cheques grade 10 education helped development either. Give someone 3k every 2 week pay sudden become important themselves. cases rising Netherlands? America fudges numbers nothing letting run course.

This true all. 

* ""Fudging numbers"" handwaving: states might, donot. 

* US different levels lockdown

* big chunk US population wearing masks use Apollo, set individual websites always open Reader View :) Really handy. Yesterday, mother told fathers brother became confirmed case earlier week. still don’t take seriously. told me, went sisters house (I’m welcome there) spend time sister grandson without mask on. today, mother went mothers house also thinks virus won’t without mask.

I’ve lost job months ago UIA still hasn’t given dime unenjoyment. didn’t even qualify PUA ended last weekend?!

I’m scraping nothing. I’ve lost everything, including friends Pandemic. family won’t even talk anymore think I’m delusional. 

I’m broke 40 pounds. Everyone keeps telling get fucking job. I’m trying, it’s extremely hard without phone car. Yet somehow nobody understands.

Take care dudes. 

Work hard please nice! That's bummer, loved watching balloons float city lived there. Honestly wish could believe us care absolutely think that's true. agree, giving facts. let in. 1% 3 million people.

The idea stave amount people dying using preventative measures vaccine developed. see value approach?

If measures undertaken, keeping numbers infected people walking around magnitudes lower, basis assumption everyone get vaccine developed? Call friends support centrist politicians. Republicans basically lost cause, push Democrats left pave way actual progress things like healthcare climate change. Continuing support centrist Democrats nothing pat lip service change going accomplish anything. took 3.5 weeks get letter mother. lives 26 miles away, basically marathon run. 

The mail services getting really messed-up Trump, screw election. shit scary. probably mean preventing spread, need pedantic Sorry hear :/
My job WFH since March (we covid scare didn’t want tell us about). boss’s daughter scientist thinks she’s overreacting. kept x employees fired 4.5x employees don’t ‘have money’. Except redid place floors coworkers going (Lights/ac/etc) since March. mad team since 2 us won’t come in. point since everyone things didn’t get wouldn’t come in. Like.. know everyone’s things.. home.. hard pass
I things, it’s safe Best hope Republicans get voted complicit get tried domestic terrorism. ""Former President, VP, multiple senators trial domestic terrorism led death millions, trial"" would fantastic headline wake people allowed happen. Would rather need that, are. Take good look Vyondis approval keep eye Aducanumab deciding politicized FDA days. gotten pretty bad. 

That said, vaccine decisions trial results heavily scrutinized inside outside FDA, there's bit less room greasing wheels usual. also much greater risk companies get wrong. Trump would issue pardon mean countries take action them. Pfizer may US company, mean Europe obliterate face earth actions warranted it.

And Pharma, amounts money play really large - less single year revenue single blockbuster drug. Pharmas much matter global goodwill - would lose fuck up.  Instead useful idiot, try reading article keep referring to, specifically 1890 Epidemic Act that’s mentioned extensive powers gives federal government. 

What didn’t work US administration’s lack response. authority prevent deaths there, went unexercised. 

So again, ask, stop BS. I'm going way, way limb saying people actually read past headline. feel. staying home time keeping family isolated. phone banking voting election.  I'm happy take vaccine long term studies.

Oh, what's that, idea problems vaccine cause long term?

Alright, I'm going wait years see pans out..

I hope controversial opinion. counting recoveries deaths? UK totally impossible right now, nothing cant screw up. Surface level infection really crazy it? 
I stopped getting anxious surface contamination long sanitize hands i'm touch frequently used surfaces (i.e. door knobs, handles, railings.. etc). wipe stuff buy grocery store wipe putting away, we're good. 
They seem think that's biggest way spreads, instead knew bare god damned minimum. wanna say number insane, that's cases day, right?

97k new cases among kids within two weeks.

today 64k new cases compared yesterday expect false positive false negative. Well fatality rate right 5% Might well start writing censored words Chinese. I'm willing bet that's literally hyperbole. Nobody even 10% infection rate. There's side fear mongering.  ""A lot people run Kyle."" Side effects may include difficulty breathing, hair loss defenestration. “In general direction covid” kids asthma, diabetes, obese, plenty high risk kids. even healthy kids could long lasting effects, new barely understood virus good assume things it. Let's say someone high school actually died due covid-19, case school would hold court? it’s fine, kids switch seats every 14 minutes Sue principal. politicization virus disgusting every side. Imagine science teacher school. Ding ding ding! 

The ""Rote learning"" taught schools many ways poor way demonstrate actual intelligence. quite good sorting useful ""yes men"" cronies hard workers. Well also probably thrown 10 times resources believe not, kid sized coffins actually high demand normally.

you might want prepare get one case they're still available. Yet released numbers. suspect obesity, hypertension, alcoholism, smoking &amp; diabetes foreign sturgis crowd. Lots people gonna start mysteriously dropping dead soon pneumonia. Bullshit unfortunately many people believe. I've read somewhere, 5 days supposed infection.

Googled found Medical using test shown false-negative rate less 5 percent five days post exposure."" Unfortunately, smart half country dragged stupid half. Selfish entitlement Go away! fear monger sub eliminate voices! easy you’re small island middle nowhere completely cut rest world. Prez might call ""Chinavirus"" pretty certain rest world calling TrumpVirus something similar upcoming months (or years still cannot shake it) :/ Follow money.  Yes I'm glad saw Moving Pictures tour. some, it. Many deniers feel sense control within lives all. Believing hoax(along false ideas) gives sense control, meaning even. makes others. countries exception Belgium population centers part. Belgium much smaller, added get closer population. population combined provides good comparison IMO. Also, ethnic diversity along urban rural areas. 

Germany steady trend cases. Spain France surged cases again. Hopefully they’ll reverse course soon. 

It’s good see California, Arizona, Texas Florida trending cases deaths, especially Arizona. Georgia seems struggling. challenge get places moving right direction others start surge. Yet also country rationed ww2, came together put aside differences right. Sure maybe generation exception. slavery allowed long ""eh go away eventually."" ""Well makes us shit ton money so..."" even reconstruction disaster ""Hey make president I'll stop making sure Lynch black people "" north east like ""fine live state near ME."" also bring anti immigrant fuck. 

And that's domestic crap Effectiveness another concern.

There's lot people smoke weed helps lot, anxiety pain relief. There's way could justify sending 70 year old cancer patient jail grew single plant windowsill (which would happen places like Louisianna) That's shame.they make exceptions It’s reinfection. It’s body doesn’t actually clear virus reactivates. ends killing people heart attacks, etc. going find good chunk people long lasting health effects virus. conservatives act like can’t care one issue time? make worse. understand issue addresses I’d like see electoral college go away presidential elections. outsized representation senate gives rural states enough, mind, address rural representation. mention many state legislatures also give rural voters outsized representation. actions produced highest fatality rate Scandinavia, far.

The numbers make clear policy failure. benefit, disadvantages. countries, types would maybe make 5% population big deal crazy irresponsible; America, 1/3 population.

That 100 million nutters running around tin foil wrapped around heads sneezing tiktok views.

With many crazy people, disorganised, corrupt, ideologically divided government, nothing ever going get dealt with. live 2. That’s know super spreaders. Reread comment. saying kids limited interaction since began giving people false sense security kids don’t spread it. agreement. Lol HEPA P100. Look 3m P100 filters. actually surprisingly easy breathe through. watching moistly.

mmmmmm.... omg... yeah swim lake, naughty boy, you... tell wearing... It’s you. Everyone’s risk. That’s whole point. Kids 10 died virus. 

You cant infringe others right life. 99.6% refrigerator

This madness!!!! EU countries' military spending obviously lower America's, combined defense budget still 3x higher Russia's. Russia really threat small countries bordering it. Claiming countries like France UK, nukes, afford social programs US protects nonsense. Karens/Kevins sounds good too. It’s like Muslims ever go war Muslims anything right? Americans? people know? Mixture dont care, dont believe, conspiracy, president Florida governor claiming everything fine control constantly reminding followers absolutely amazing control on. Many people family thinks experts saying opposite political agendas like trying make president look bad therefore cant trusted. Honestly way long leaders now. Incredibly frustrating time American, I'm completely utterly disgusted. see future country ever respected ever trusted advice guidance ever again. without doubt turning point country people realize years late. We're going hap-hap-happiest Covid-19! Could provide source that? data I've seen suggests difference excess death versus reported deaths suggests underestimating COVID deaths.

Yes, may difference DALYs lost 68 versus now. old people's lives considered forfeit they're old. People's lives worth saving they're prime.

Our reaction comprehensive efficient. Controlling virus minimizing death solves problems related spread. No, imo smoke drink. personally think people smoke drink least till 25. makes people act dumb leads lot problems, plus studied since human brain fully developed till 25, cause damage brain still developing. Thank reply. Hadn’t put much thought it, make valid points agree, extending point jobs America even two weeks extra hours expected them. ""Good jobs"" America mostly myth. put around 50-60 hours matter industry go unless upper management, salary per hour rate generally falls comparable countries large margin. many times history rushed vaccines caused terrible issues years later. Jesus that’s lot state low population public health background. I'm expert, knowledge. NZ (and lesser extent world) could go years like without vaccine. folks wear masks, keep physical distance, wash sterilize stuff. bother, yes, go shopping, go movies restaurants restrictions. real advantage low numbers (not if) someone gets Covid, test results back quickly infected trace back everyone they've contact with. People self-isolating tested get results back quickly. bit adjustment, worth saving lives. think winter Canada sucks put it. fact, we've wearing 'masks' 4 months year anyway, lol. Ironic lot business America ""No blacks, Irish"" rule. opposite. won’t 300k December. would involve ridiculous increase daily deaths. get 1mm ignore epidemiological evidence herd immunity. That’s admin matters.

The admin wants everything get back normal ASAP. They’re even still denying virus real threat. want schools, businesses, etc. go back normal regardless danger virus poses.

They obviously don’t see denying seriousness virus enough get everything back open (though it’s hugely successful making lot idiots denying). next best bet get vaccine ASAP regardless efficacy safety.

There’s reason Trump right keeps pushing hydroxychloroquine pushing legal protections businesses schools reopening. want everything open back regardless however many people get sick die.

So, would vaccine pushed supported admin likely developed? safety efficacy mind, urgency primary factor?

We’ve already seen admin leaned CDC, Justice Dept., governmental institutions, affecting policy directives. Would unthinkable admin would lean FDA approve vaccine isn’t safe? Yeah schools across country opening September uk Stopping college kids partying? Good luck. b) problem

Its actually problem entire country. really problem tourists all.

There difference problem problem. Irish *have* problem. tourists *are* problem. tourists ignoring quarantine dont problem.

I dont see thats obvious. Well GOP pretty much co opted Confederate Flag symbol progress Gee, could forseen packed high school without anybody wearing masks would directly result COVID-19 transmission....?

**England ‘almost reaching herd immunity’ COVID wards empty, death toll plunges**

&amp;#x200B;

The number people hospital England COVID-19 fallen 96 per cent since peak pandemic, official data reveals.

Hospital staff treating 700 coronavirus patients day England, compared 17,000 day middle April, according NHS England.

Last week, hospitals single coronavirus patient wards, one top doctor suggesting [Britain “almost reaching herd sign good news, virus death toll hospitals also plummeted. April 10, day highest number deaths announced nation, NHS England said 866 people died. Thursday last week, five hospital deaths across entire country. represents fall 99 per cent height fatalities crisis.

Dr Ron Daniels, intensive care consultant Birmingham, one worst hit areas, said “huge downturn” admissions.

Last Thursday, across three hospitals serve 50 per cent Birmingham’s population, three critically ill COVID-19 patients. “Compare couple months ago, almost 200 patients ventilated one given time, huge downturn,” said.

&amp;#x200B;

Doctors health leaders said dramatic fall demand means sick delay seeking help illnesses. mounting concerns impact lockdown wider health millions, cancer, heart lung disease patients particular hit delays diagnosis treatment.

Daniels said figures showed cause optimistic, even recent rise cases areas Aberdeen Preston.

A future increase hospital admissions could ruled out, said, expect one. “I think that’s highly unlikely, pubs open month, people socially interacting heavily time, natural history disease contract virus you’re going end hospital, you’re pretty much hospital within 15 days contracting it.”

He said reason hospital admissions deaths plunging “really difficult say precision” likely due combination factors, vulnerable likely fall seriously ill COVID-19 infected “very early March April”.

Another factor virus may become “less angry, less virulent”.

“There evolutionary advantage \[to virus\] conferred killing host. desire virus replicate replicate better living host. may factor. think quite likely we’re almost reaching herd immunity.”

His view supported recent research Oxford University, led epidemiologist Professor Sunetra Gupta, suggests UK may achieved sufficient level herd immunity prevent second wave COVID-19. Scientists say “threshold” herd immunity may lowered many people may already immune disease without ever caught it.

&amp;#x200B;

Hospitals scaling back number ward areas used coronavirus patients, admissions fall lowest levels since start pandemic.

East Suffolk North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, provides hospital community healthcare services one million people across east England, treating “substantially lower” number patients compared peak pandemic. Last week Colchester Hospital five confirmed COVID-19 patients. Ipswich Hospital none. Neill Moloney, trust’s deputy chief executive, said trend “really encouraging”.

With virus admissions falling rapidly, Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive NHS England, urged hospitals tackle much waiting list possible winter. number people waiting treatment set hit 10 million end year.

In letter NHS regional directors, Stevens wrote: “Having pulled stops treat Covid patients last months, health services need redouble focus needs patients too.”

The focus must switched “accelerating return near-normal levels non-Covid health services”.

Hospitals told hit 70 per cent normal rate planned operations month. must rise 80 per cent September overnight day-case procedures, 90 per cent October.

*The Times* take shot Hope Jericho's next ""list"" gimmick contact tracing. tell people slow testing down. papers going stop conflating declining deaths herd immunity, majority UK population infected. people hear hundreds people dying every day impact begins ripple communities people take precautions day day lives, impacts spread virus rocket science. numbers going Sweden herd immunity people saw amount people dying stopped going outside voluntarily hard understand ffs. could prevented? Good. Weddings people anywhere. Outside defs better inside risked it.

I went party since seen lot while, going keep social distance + mask. Also cases near low could. Except seeing surge cases recommending another lockdown. tumor ur leg rona Oof, everything going on, losing Neil real blow morale. bummer. worthless. can't believe see signs yards. We're going seeing huge outbreaks soon. party like 200 high school kids, new cases went 300 new cases day 900-1000 every day.

Parson done nothing, continue nothing! could anyone vote that? Although, voting Aug 4th...I'm getting hopes Parson lose. reason failed COVID strategy complete utter moron President. fish rots head down. We're number one!!! We're number one!! US par EU countries death rate, many higher death rates worse economies. sub acts like US beyond me. republicans want many people die possible.

how would politically advantageous want people die? point I'm making, holy fucking shit. point majority used want that, supreme court protected generations. People gotten stupid. 100k spent Russia Facebook

Likely correct. Facebook ads primary means. guy looks like picture health..what could possibly happened? Especially schools. Language specifically Oh, run elections ecomomic concerns win long term well being?

That's good know, thought like 365 days year....every year. Everybody. together this. need figure oust current leadership culpable dipshits contributing situation. wow turns get control act fucking retarded  test results taking week, it’s smarter use tools toolbox feel like I'm living parallel universe. I'm Bay Area. went shelter-in-place mid-March. mask mandate long that. time, I've mostly stayed home. Venturing weekly bi-weekly grocery run, Home Depot, hike so. essentially leave house like max three times per week go somewhere maybe small walks around block, always wear mask. stores mandate masks, people abide. Even hikes trails, people mostly wearing masks. get mask-shamed don't. went north last weekend hike (because like 4 months since escaped 10 mile bubble) people obeying social distance appear even mask. talk family east coast like another world. fact dine-in restaurant something can't even imagine. talk going vacation places I'm like ""you that?!"" Even state, I've watched YouTube videos shot LA beaches there's mask sight. I'll always ask husband ""is pre-COVID?"" he'll reply ""no, yesterday."" 

I feel like I'm another planet. I'm following rules outlined people much informed disease - feel like people whatever want. 

I'm necessarily afraid happen get it, found responsible passing along someone else eventually died, would feel responsible - that's heed warnings. miss family east coast. seen since Christmas know I'll able again. they're older healthiest feel safe. You’re spreading bullshit need backup claims.

Because easily I’m pretty sure allowed open, didn’t commit crime therefore can’t locked up. Many people South America must go daily bring home food eat. Even careful, risk. yes, mask-free assholes Brazil everywhere else help course. problems stem religious devotion well, Christianity culture often intersect way regular physical attendance seen virtue regular absences seen vice. America, buy food week one store 4 miles away want. many ""us"" physically gathering choice socially prefer it. really don’t think hit million given 300k December?  guess it’ll 15 going zero, righhhhhht? I'm talking voter base, congressmen general. stop infatuation stops killing 1500 people day. Yes also case Canada fathom something fake politics cause divide family friends. 

It's supposed us vs government. us vs other. can't get people vaccinate kids US. see mandatory vaccinations thing one told there's 14 day quarantine goes anyway, that's a) stupid b) problem.. especially complain it

I agree travel stopped entirely virus either contained eradicated that's we've got work atm. swear people look bullshit, nonsensical articles post here. parties, trips, college: COVID-19 rules fall

FTFY Exactly. First thought “we’re stopping 4?”  people unironically believe mask eliminate thing? That’s add “severe” there. polls vary. last one saw 40% leaning no. point Swedish strategy also avoid flip-flopping keep measures place duration. Failing that, government power close businesses public places deemed necessary. Let’s hope needed. Keep eye u/atealein’s post bi-weekly press conference refresh daily want keep eye progress. 

And information, take deadly serious holed apartment entire spring. visited mother, turned 70 last year, midsummer first time since pandemic started. 

Thank concern. Paulding County- surprised precautions aren’t taken seriously. work hard take context struggle reading comprehension? Okay tell us symptoms have.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* figure last year

Excess deaths usually calculated week week, comparing given weeks deaths rolling five-year average. need accept COVID responsible, directly indirectly, 200,000 deaths US. Anything else pure denial. Maybe, maybe not. That's speculation.

You know confirmed test.

Speculation Science. Russian vaccine cause knows kind long term side-effects.  arguing emotion fear science. laws Caucasian retired year road trip visiting friends .They new people weekly last two months. think everything wearing masks public. friends/family masks social distancing. waiting catch covid. Europe would well permanently ban travel western hemisphere.  protected Sky Man.  Oxford University experts come conclusion analysing deaths, youd know clicked link government saying it. pop. thing say, course I'd believe actually showed proof. believe without seeing evidence.

\-Flat Earthers, Anti-Vaxxers Yeah, too. don’t see end sight. one made claim! post sources claims.

But fair lot people posting super lazy shit. Really small underpowered studies.  Climbing tree brews friends much fun. Who'd a'thunk it?  ran tears long ago. point done hope best, prepare worst. going take vaccines one company like brand, might well anti-vax, there's zero way Oxford produce enough vaccines alone, nor, UK group, prioritize sending US. mean I'm socially distanced field scientist lower risk group. Short virus returning Italy like numbers state intend maintain distancing try wait least 1 year mark. Uhh...

So cool saying ""Alcohol danger."" ? unfortunately thing is, zero room error. is, antivaxx conspiracy crowd surge grow like never speak vaccines decades come. 

Idk error, would worried consequence antivaxxers worst part type deny disease also started say ""I let vaccinate me, who's me?"" still occasionally find rats infected plague, nothing ever really disappears. I've tired since subreddit created, place sucks, people bowling alley, dance clubs, every restaurant, eachother roller rinks malls bf went CVS drive took exactly 14 days get results. dad went got done urgent care center 2 days got back within 48 hours. win. Aaaand proved point. Yup buddies included. Haven’t seen months haven’t quarantined one bit. Ah yes, another narcissistic tactic...you're right! whitehouse propaganda time election. allowed travel Canada, Europe, Australia others let in, Trump start calling countries losers names. Right, yet published peer-reviewed journal. study find that, less month old, take grain salt. That's unreasonable. Ones gain benefits cozying him.
Use web search find them. We've already purchased large volumes Oxford Vaccine US distribution. So, doubting understanding situation Great. Let’s start re-opening! 👍 I'm sure brother publicly proud TV. Make Thalidomide babies great again! enough contact it.

This first comment.

And that's huge part.

Even 50% effective vaccine massively drive one's likelihood coming enough contact vaccine. Vermont kicking tail! Great job testing contact tracking. ? plenty evidence. I'm sorry Google broken. would saying Americans travel make racist? Uhhhh, what?

""Oh want awkward moment Grandma, I'll let believe toxic shit gets people killed""

It's fucking fault behave way. Yours. ""Golly people confront way magically realize causing harm"". You.

Your fault. conscious decision people literally dying better uncomfortable. Protect best do. Hope jackasses die. experts Tweeting key Canada’s success?

You guys keep dodging question: US ? bad bot One things read said babies born needs oxygen basically limit mother provide - end pregnancy maximum sustain long periods.

Imagine quite fit jogging 24x7.that's roughly saying pregnancy gets late stages.

If that's correct, unsurprising miscarriages happen COVID. quarantining online services so... sounds like least handling right. Yes also see literally every single person know California Instagram without mask read “undeserved”. Redditing without glasses. Could provide sources this? try find stats, like know information coming from. Thanks! 

Also, believe you. case reads differently intended. much misinformation, wouldn’t doubt coming Russia like past years. reset button go back simpler times? 1950’s simpler, like 10 years ago. Considering festering anti-science internet culture lack solid education, doubt things would different results. religious people, seem really keen winning Darwin Awards families. already encountered family traveled state sturgis knowingly infected SARS CoV-2. guy coughing head bragging $2,600 wrist band access Buffalo Chip Sturgis.

How reconcile entire world wrong this, right? 

All countries, even ones first, use lockdowns, countries recovered best ones strictest lockdowns. everyone, old fat people.

And still decisions made overwhelming majorities governments today, everywhere USA, debate half-ass it. 

Why that, think? Exactly! I'm you, virtues seem short supply days among people. point young woman infected time entire world acutely aware dangers COVID-19. Even so, Martinez ignored safety regulations wear face mask.

I feel sorry blame want punish suffered much possible suffer still alive, guess. got punishment, way deserved.

Do know deserves punishment? asshole bikers Sturgis. quote remains true. entire world acutely aware, still people making foolish choices ignorant dirt. dumbing america. ""leaders"" made political. deaths hands. would think lot people would get vaccinated vaccine becomes available..but want wait 6 months year. beginning (February) narrative I’ve always heard “flatten curve”. 

That means everyone gets it. time. everyone surprised numbers increasing? always goal. something changed? narrative “don’t get it”? Would first I’ve heard. ""Terrorists killed 3000 Americans. Time go war next 20 years.""

""1000 Americans dying every day. is."" organization financial ties Trump? safe so, id love go see this, never heard it! safe risking anyone's health this.  Monetary policy co-opted anti science movement (conservatism) science driven policy isnt. Simple that. New York 1660 deaths per million. New Zealand 4.5 deaths per million.

Please explain parameters NY alright? Lol! Disinfecting almost irrelevant. need wear masks (which isn’t going happen), tucked. Softbank CEO wanted fund millions tests Feb, triggered controversy Japaneses people flooded Twitter accusing wanting make Japan look bad, eventually pulled idea due backlash.

If surprised Japaneses would go denial, clearly know first thing Japan. sure trying say? mean COVID infections widespread studies show-then yes agree. data scientists study it. Thanks gold kind stranger. I'd ask friends around world recognize madness reflective small vocal (And currently powerful) part America, whole. seeing possible specific set political failures. wary negative influence right now, write us off. Probably, amounts unknown. guess Stockholm got though since winter holiday last Scandinavian cities. February 24 March 1. tactics used Germans French years war, too.

If want point American idiocy, much better examples that. I’m enjoying craft beer chillin Sunday loser. Use phone google death rate COVID you’ll see I’m correct. don’t subscribe doom gloom doesn’t mean I’m bot. means utilize critical thinking skills. Something obviously lack. Good luck getting parents basement loser. Trump never even got close, travel restrictions.

France, China others great put mandatory 14 quarantine inbound international travelers. got proactive tracking infected.

Trump nothing. hiking lahar mt helens, almost ran gas, stumbled across park ranger made phone call keep gas station open....

Portland?

A tiger... Africa? 
A tiger... Africa?! r/NegativeWithGold offence sorry nope. saw guy driving motorcycle highway today. wearing mask. wearing helmet. 🤷🏻‍♂️ *""We-ah-must-uh-meet-ah-the-uh-moment.""*

One worst public speakers I've ever seen. Keep riding horse buddy. even bother notice said nothing soon would happen? can’t conceivably move virus properly vaccinated. Why? fair jo one bring risk me. properly, takes 3 5 YEARS become citizen legally, right way it.

So, take incredulity properly stuff boyo. blocking one negative people ever interacted reddit choose longer so. remember one polio vaccines got contaminated live virus.

Are talking OPV live virus? Yes, squarely 1 party's issue. works pretty well. would probably go candy.

If 100 M&amp;M's 1 poisoned, would eat one? many friends family would give one well? Germany concerned rise less 1000 cases yet usa 50k cases day see issues might thinking ""no **developed country** would that"", still wrong. Italy Berlusconi. UK Boris. Austria Jorg Haider. 

There plenty others examples come mind right now. Insightful fear. want admit bad really is, pretend get lucky enough get sick supports belief system. need know  much  help

The article list estimates. 65% transmission reduction according one report, 40% according other, 95% another one, on. 

or they're undertesting  irrelevant conversation.

Great. Go tell family Cuomo's nursing home victims they're irrelevant conversation. Cases going report numbers White House good Hey fuck buddy Science vs. Politics, it’s choice. Yup. Buying right farm, it’s much better (and usually cheaper grocery store). lucky able often do! many also asymptomatic tested still spreading virus? Oh asking false positives asked false negatives. 

Ffs government said 787 Max safe. “Wow Billy, great coffin! joints top notch. hime room teacher gonna look really nice this.” - stay fuck backwards ass land - like third world country next door. Eh Cheddar Header? Honestly, it’s hard make things political ‘leader’ pushing schools open it’s proven many times point it’s way early. He’s even gone record saying BS claims like children immune virus go away (the latter claim he’s spouted time time course year.) I'll give cake! Happy cake day! think interesting constitutional issues involved. school district within rights suspend her.

Having said that, super morons would like think would kind parent would reward praise child suspended. good thing. Nice. don’t bother thinking deeply

Yeah, mitigation methods using

I know never see anyone explain ""masks work Denmark Finland using they're fine"" articles. obviously something different countries America. things control don't, despite mostly wearing masks. Well yes, proof cause hospitalizations decreasing spam month? 

Or going blame decline deaths well? Well, actual grown ups make actual decisions policies base things reality. yeah guess entire population stay home across world noone dies. tell me, many kids willing let die influenza meningitis drunk driving year?

We've already got plenty statistics percentage US vaccinations (16%, sadly). Yeah. afford pay ton get rid rest Hey, I'm keeping 💯 know votes? much agree politically fuck going USA, still say ""I hate it""...so that's said, move out. 

Take deep breath, smoke good Indica chill fuck out, life's short 💨🙏 think many acknowledge deaths, try rationalize excess deaths due lock downs, people get treated illness, etc.

Of course part it, terrible secondary impact. excuse Covid deaths discount. Might want invest fake syrian passport stop shaving... now. 78% people one study comprised people symptoms 33% hospitalized - nowhere near representative sample anything - showed abnormalities (which go away). JAMA article didn’t tie 78% people actually suffering anything result slightly increased inflammation. gotten posted 10th time week Probably things like mentioned one thread deaths worldwide probably much higher reported someone replied like ""lol, think people's loved ones dying hospitals hiding bodies without noticing?""

As far health care workers, know either. human sacrifice right now, less soldiers sent foreign war economic conquests come home missing limbs ptsd. Again, report evidence this? Thank flippant. try explain plainly: normal summer, much like normal spring. 

""Normal"" summers say involve camps, time grandparents, vacations, playdates friends etc. help working parents juggle childcare work period. 

But summer, two things stopped that. 

First: lack supply - camps, lots activities shut etc. 

Second, choice safety easier life + disease. Sure could take kids see grandparents, ok putting health risk. Sure could send kids play friends, ok putting health risk, ditto activities camps etc. 

Choosing easier life attempting ""normal"" summer partly lead rampaging virus thousands deaths. Many, many parents chose safety. means 3 months caring kids full time, top 3 months already did. 

Seriously, tough. Even little things like going store, usually opportunity take kids out, option there's mask rule short using duct tape, cant keep mask 2 year old (and even could, fair others IMO claim executive privilege potentially put others risk easier you). 

School starting safely lifeline many parents clinging light end tunnel. looks like another choice safety vs ease life (+ disease death everyone). Many parents luxury choice go former. find quite funny thorough, technical accurate explication nuances human immune response, role antibodies vis vis T-cells--which latched onto kind magical totem sub, whilst hilariously fail demonstrate understanding even basics like CD4 vs CD8 cells--somehow brings downvote brigade. little tip: wallowing delusions fantasies much good. immunological response is.

Unfortunately isn’t good idea currently Banner health announced weeks ago. permission slip, speak, still apply. mention obsessed Sweden's officials statistics.

All played. Content's always biased Bill Gates. get love deserves. owe world all, yet life's work help humans live. Man that’s scary. I’ll sure advise risks hopefully stay away dense areas people. CDC put yesterday (don't link, I'm sure reddit prevail) death toll year around 260k higher average year? would suggest far higher number end year, closer half million mark. “It is.” source that? Right, thought realized teachers high school around 15 years older them. I'm assuming mean Americans, vote every election. I've already voted year's primary. 

Trump win popular vote. screwed electoral college. true, can't know one way another yet. simply sufficient pool potential second exposures previous hotspots months later, since officials prior outbreak areas (NYC, Wuhan) clamped hard bring RO well 1, meaning there's little circulating coronavirus potential reinfect anyone who'd previously. top sheer improbability encountering second time even assuming random interaction without social distancing. definitely doable REALLY tried. there's LOT money table try:

* bubble isolated location middle nowhere: bring trailers everyone live in. Build bunch fields there; astroturf going do. Training facilities meagre compared players expect; make do.

* one allowed without 2 week quarantine coming back in. Players paid plenty play game always opt out. Everyone else (referees, etc): give pay bonus.

* Cut team sizes small possible. Reduce length play help make possible: 12 minute quarters, 10 minute quarters, less.

* Cut coaching staff. Head coaches offensive defensive coordinators (or want get really complicated, lower level coaches/coordinators coach via Zoom watching game stream outside bubble).

* Cut whoever can, even things seem small: maybe get rid instant replay season reduce number people bubble.

In end, simply NFL season year. think need evidence say reinfection possible, immunity typically lasts 6 months reinfection would possible would seen little none it. still effective method preventing spreading

Is dumb knowledge, believe one reason trials take longer much time needed monitor side-effects. difficult get many subjects exposed virus. trying find new vaccine xyz virus today, chances could ages dozen subjects get naturally, good data look at.

With COVID vaccine, less hurdle. Many Phase III trials taking place South Africa Brazil, current breeding grounds virus. administer vaccine/placebo tens thousands hotspot areas, likely 40-50 exposed end year. fact, think kind Oxford's study operating right (please take word one). first big milestone dozen subjects exposed virus, particularly tied specific date.

That's say going research done long-term effects. unlikely ever stop. Guarantee 2025 pandemic hopefully over, Oxford Moderna like still monitoring vaccinated population side-effects. still happening currently existing vaccines afaik. still released. seems general consensus among scientific community trials test efficacy vaccine keep eye long-term side-effects way round.

Another reason couple experimental vaccines (not Moderna) already existed decade now. ""edited"" fit genome virus causes COVID. like different flu shot every year US. fact many countries, investors, big pharma corporations pooling money resources vaccine research, I'm sure timeline going normal.

**TLDR: limiting factor trials less time exposure subjects virus. current vaccines ""bases"" already exist years now.

Win win. sure agree interpretation. 

Covid definitely doesn’t save lives lowering car crashes. caused lockdown. increasing deaths closed medical centers late cancer screening. lockdown related. 

We fairly attribute excess deaths Covid social response Covid, isn’t Covid alone. didn’t close medical centers may increased Covid deaths decreased cancer deaths. Unlikely exactly equal trade off. 20 minutes Sturgis Rapid City pop 70,000 sees lot traffic rally. necessarily. concerns getting flu shot early cause weaker protection late spring. Especially elderly. year concerns small potatoes compared Covid crisis. evidence based on. Unless cities use field turf problem solved. issue places field turf hot beds covid atm. tax dollars work!

Hasn’t gone away sadly. see people say old people get affected economy smh. There’s way socially distance contact sport. Milken Institute better tracker.  feel you. think aulglangly seemed like troll. Dude could i'd make decisions pandemic over.  Thank this. Idk article trying accomplish, likely fearmongering attract attention Wrong. Yeah sub trash letting kind info stay front page without sort comment article pinned top comment.

If look lot panic articles people post here, are:

1. Anecdotes. Useful initial information gathering, relied on.

2. Data pulled specific groups people, perhaps bias.

3. Method obtaining data suspect. in, call people ask them, ""Have experienced brain fog,"" rather data gathered actual doctor making readings.

4. Fail mention many things cause ""permament damage"" bodies. Like pneumonia, quite common lung damage lasts months, even year. many things cause pneumonia.

I trying play virus saying serious, people make fun Facebook Karen's spreading conspiracy theories research people taking unproven, non peer reviewed studies/articles saying opposite putting way much them. five months feeling frustrated ineptitude US government's response COVID-19, five months watching idiots reject masks throw parties, reached point giving fuck.

I'm sick watching countries put health collective wealth individual, US continues stubbornly opposite. I'm sick watching literally every single piece news data politicized argued like hyenas fighting bones. I'm sick watching people act blatant self-interest, complete disregard others. I'm sick watching floundering man-child center attention clumsily gropes power, keeps everyone distracted sideshow abhorrent tweets sleight-of-hand political maneuvers.

I want out. know US resolve internal conflict without completely collapsing, want whole thing crumbles weight. time, everyone know love here. can't see restarting another country. result feel lost purposeless stuck tar-pit dying nation.

But nahhh lot lok article seems suggest people coronaviruses may sort cross immunity (which explains someone get severely others not). moving comparing estimated cases actual cases? Good job! try figure multiple 3. Maybe ask parents? Flu still deadly. Sorry reality match want be. Stick video games kids. Thinking going well you. Looks like fine people. missed.  think pretty clear almost everyone point original comment administration's mismanagement brought us point sort sad thing happens. really think someone claiming US president actually personally signed restrictions funeral attendance every locality country? correct, not. High five, great contribution. time people believe science understand worse side effects happen right vaccination, product rushed situation we're dire is, every vaccine government backed immunity/indemnity Hence quoted Joker many seem expecting beginning many, many stories like this. doesn’t, rona discriminate based whether large gathering BLM protest/riot, anti-lockdown protest biker rally. Obviously rona doesn’t propagate BLM protests/riots Winkity wink wink  Killing makes sense everyone gets money owed, doubt ever happen Well jumped conversation someone claiming covid deaths undercounted. Maybe butt next time. Thanks explanation! Shhhh scare logic! could trump put place NYC unable themselves? resources every municipality besides federal government itself.

They built auxiliary hospitals even necessary end. part, yes. Also notable evidence micro vessel disease might expect clotting disorder. Right back 💙 Better nothing. that’s big deal, regardless. hope russkoe vaccine work fine drink lot milk take vitamin + k7 going mournful yearbooks. Oh terrified. However work, we've given choice. parents vs. schools. happens US puts work profits people's health. fucked evil shit evict sick woman onto street jump high building. dies, supposed happen. supposed happen, Jesus catch arms float like feather. sounds like lot Saturday thing I’ve seen come close ASAP Rocky drama We’re proud too! chose health family! novel coronavirus, nobody immunity it. Closest coronavirus Sars almost nobody got.  humans clearly require social interaction others. Can’t push college football spring much safer? Awww got downvoted day saying vaccine help much (ie: 50%) refuse take it. It’s good suggestion, United States America’s built upon foundation solid fundamentals many us wish realize again, even means watching house burn building back foundation. side effects might let live normal life. Supreme Court strike down.  


Very generous assumption. Nevermind, already regret interacting you, win. context? don't.

Parents go back work kids back school. That's about. Anyone says otherwise lying you. american goes Wuhan. Reinfects entire population. Cycle starts again. infection never ends. Yes goes friends. people, starting travelling, knowing was.... ""You're un-suspended, come back.""

""No, think I'm good right home!"" people, Neanderthals. point (soon?) actions (inactions?) need criminalized, don’t they? Let’s gather tightly-packed auditorium discuss potential solutions! MD family said would examine tests performed, rate high suspicious mean there's massive different minimum viable product months testing approval across thousands participants. Asymptomatic, I’m sure  Well called wanted mods would yank post . Basically coward wrote story trying point dont approve finger fozzy playing show mask becomes widely available, new cases adults banished disease island. get romanticizing covid deaths fucking weird. article explicitly states ""We got numbers (Barren River District Health Department) go back July 1,"" Skipper said. ""Their numbers cover anyone identified WKU students (that) live 8 county health department district.""

You would need include testing #'s Baren River District Health Department get positive rate. get banned spamming Bill Gates antichrist/Don't let microchip meme? god, /r/spitroast tastes great^^^nsfw! This.my mom incredibly high risk wary vaccine coming market quickly.it really reassuring we're told vaccine promising coming along nicely time new stuff damned thing keeps popping up. Sigh.... many grandparents gonna die? main difference coronavirus preferably kill young men, war did. death widespread, bias toward older people though. Masks work. may infections, spikes. parents Ireland trip scheduled May. moved October. Last month canceled altogether. don’t want quarantine, understandable.

But ignoring quarantine orders exactly virus going remain problem months years come. People need stop selfish bit. Yes, remember better look 7-14-30 day averages day-to-day. saying necessarily it, outliers exist. Hopefully situation continue move direction though. Supreme Court strike down. 

What I'm sick tired us cater ""real american"" assholes. majority, made people's lives hell. they're minority, they're STILL making lives hell. South/Midwest held country hostage prevented progress decades now.
Always wrong side history. think kind hearted person judgmental, however lot people traveling long distances stopping places may hospital capacity spreading covid communities. 

Also, seeing images normalizes behavior time need get handle virus. Unfortunately feel people less likely follow rules like mask wearing eating/drinking indoors big groups like this. article states one person drove Arizona intended follow guidelines ended so. Easy everyone needs working brain know work.

No matter much evidence matter. Cool bro, fun rona ... 405,000 American died ww2 Yep. Trevor soft, journalism claws. Yes, it’s irrational. 1,620,000 people died ordinary, non-corona virus causes since march.

Posting big numbers context sensational misleading fuck.

Is problem? Yes. world ending? remotely.

America 320,000,000 people time pandemic effectively America’s population *will increased*.

The media loves panic hates informing. That’s true! makes sense, see this. definitely acknowledge threat. 

What's strange aforementioned acknowledgment various life threats areas adamant refusal here. Politics, education, class play. 

We living interesting times, indeed. worry much. [Watch restore doomed.!&lt; Recently (necessary) long-drive road trip. Public rest-stop bathrooms— East Coast anyway— mostly zero contact (unless need sit), clean airy rarely one person *everyone* wearing mask. Hotels might bit trickier close quarters people spend lot time unmasked. slept vehicle hotels offer one else room previous 48 hours. 

IMO probably safer going grocery store. political representative area fun tropical vacation.....on essentially dime, sans masks....while others area losing homes? Aww cry river Betty. Also cares say? matter amount evidence someone want wear mask fight tooth nail take prove masks slow spread?

The fact people already told cover coughs.

A mask like better method thing

Think like covering cough without coughing hand elbow. much convenient Fine. I'll clear.

In many situations history, strategy worked. also work future. endorse it. Can't right, pension system designed unlimited growth. Thank God also hate immigrants there. Bro P2W jump Maybe. don’t know got it. Maybe wife nurse, maybe got family bbq. awesome....

just awesome bro....

right they've sold souls long ago. words, never. WWIII, war versus virus stupid/selfish people 405k Americans died WWII. I’m sure got numbers. highest sales month ever June gigantic amount.

Pfft... campus students moved last weekend university town. Every day see tons cars way work packed 4-5 college kids. parties maybe slightly smaller less plentiful throughout week. bar district town packed students even moved back even lots foot traffic. Oh cases, theres 1 person groups see wearing mask 50/50 chance sitting chin. 187 cases, 330 tests performed strong feeling absentee ballots ""mysteriously"" disappear nation wide found days election day. opening early. wouldn’t normally open first week sept, since closed last year many opening early make lost time give longer year case need shut again. schools article closed 5 months. See, exactly kind information government needs push public build trust. you? You’re one wanting kill old people vs young feel good. Who’s real evil one? hope won’t become old, feeble, sick Herd immunity nature taking course. serious? last time public bathroom crowded enough distance event? 

A person still wear mask 2 5 minutes they're going vehicle going bathroom. respiratory virus, something pick filthy area. person likely likely get virus nobody around spread washing hands properly touch face happens surface contamination. Bad guys killed us governing pandemic. There, connected dots you. really helped New Zealand island quarantining ***everyone*** entered.

We US can’t that. Even wanted to, borders long porous. 

Even ***could***, 15th day (1st lock-down ends) we’d get carriers coming in. 

It’s Rhode Island — hit hard Mar/Apr locked well — back trouble again: mostly RIers took vacations hot spots brought back them. Plus tourists. Plus college students. lost cause, spend much time someone who's proudly making fun fat people train thoughts fucked. can't win people, lives. dumb plan Amateur. tell everyone entire USA stay home 2 weeks pay it. essential workers get leave homes case anything big happens unexpectedly. 

Bam everything control factor. break rules Huge fine. enforced. Maybe also criminal record them.

That pretty much way control mess now. duration 2 weeks utilities free everything delayed 1 month catch back end.

But never happen. USA #1 YOLO yourself! biggest fear it'll evolve deadlier strain. We've already gotten quite [different ones notably contagious (though equally deadly) variant U.S. Europe. Even one two percentage points fatality would devastating. Americans vacation countries? Quite selfish behaviour Well much much bigger pool people who'll take vaccine compared phase 3 trial, data, maybe they'll able find anomalies something. would important vulnerable ppl pre-existing conditions, let's say. Prob healthy ppl anything worry about. know someone takes swab! sane people protested wore masks. rioters among order recognised. Maybe proof masks work protestors rioters without masks also, must infections among since also saw people videos without masks. 1,620,000 people died ordinary, non-corona virus causes since march.

It's disguised biker rally really bunch fat, old, gross boomers popping Viagra trying get hard long enough fuck lot lizard looking woman named Rocket. thought half million soldiers died ww2  vaccine-as-a-service hopefully thing Georgia's governor killed Georgians Sherman did. much this!! There's 100 years worth reasons rush vaccine b/c ppl cant control urge go Applebee's. FFS start “four years” chant? Look crowd, nobody wearing mask keeping distance. I’m saying protests aren’t risk, I’m located protests spread out, incredibly high mask compliancy, weren’t even particularly noisy. 

This bunch people shoulder shoulder singing along without face coverings. It’s death sentence, it’s insanely risky Yeah we're allowed grow 4 plants 21 Oregon well, medical card anything. yet sales still roof. Sturgis one place fly freak flag year am! stable genius. genius HUGE.  America great feels like? first wave, though.

The case fatality rate higher everywhere March/April June/July likely 1) even less idea treat disease 2) vulnerable population hadn’t turtled-up. Nice ty, gunna call local university hospital tomorrow n ask better ty man Mainly people hated Bill Hillary, necessarily Trump great eyes.  would’ve known Right. I'm okay ""guinea pig"" get vaccinated ASAP, hope scenario everyone waiting people guinea pigs nobody ends getting vaccinated. Glad hear gonna get it! encouraging signs though. cities infections initially peaking (Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi) seeing sustained reductions new cases day day since July 5. 

The cities initially infectious, catching up, that's taking numbers up. judging trends Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, cities start dropping new daily cases numbers 4-6 weeks. demonstrated previously hit million would require HIT meaningfully current estimates, infection fatality rate remain stable current level. 

HIT 50% level would require extreme marked increase infected people breaking quarantine actively try infect people. 

IFR remaining 0.65% would require us continue treat Covid patients way New York back March. 

Neither scenarios happen.  First got elephant. Secondly got assume elephants catch carry COVID-19. vets know case?  F*ck me, leaders really trying keep population uneducated possible - unless you’re wealthy enough go private school - aren’t they?! 

Before learning fact American teachers often buy school supplies class - even work second jobs manage - thought stuff happened truly developing war-torn countries.

Very, selfish people...most voting Trump. Welcome unfettered captialism Everybody needs close doors America don’t fuck 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 It’s met incredulity domestically well. girl’s parents went wedding Nebraska two weeks ago. small outbreak roughly four individuals confirmed COVID. wedding people got COVID.... went another wedding last night. 

The Midwest fuuuucked. $$$ Well, death death. Covid much highly transmissable ebola, which, nasty, easy get walking street. kills fewer people worldwide per year reported Covid deaths US. That’s nice summary statute! mean sentences common practice however. Look prop 47 changes made last 5 years. group 20 people? might enjoy see New York taken correct measures, things New Zealand, taking shit curve, makes sense.

The trick New Zealand without killing 33,000 people. real quality learning take place I’m sure, fear - absolutely necessary /s US government chose respond, we're paying it. happens uou blindly vote whoever R next name think good idea elect list reality TV star. options maybe try avoid Walmart. don’t even want see people Walmart behaving I’ve seen people mostly wearing masks pickup stores. lots options though - although drive minimum half hour larger city smaller town people sense...even though grocery store two minutes me. It’s huge pain ass. could start understanding time saved. they're testing, going ahead process assuming testing work out. does, wait months confirmation. doesn't, they've wasted ton money... that's governments subsidizing process, corporations take huge financial hit find vaccine they've working able distributed. Mitigation always better nothing. Judas in.. Judas state! Minnesota State Fair literally favorite thing year. I've gone least three times past several years (out 12 days). I'd requested days February.

No State Fair year, course. sucks. sucks bad. reasonable option. perpetual state shock industrial farming didn’t pay millions lobbying congress could continue do. hey let’s continue blame foreigners. Obviously doesn’t matter say. choice take vaccine, also choice vaccine.

The UK vaccine official trial end date 30/09/2021. sooner it’s rushed. End debate. southern states would rather die take experience Yankee state like NY.

You’re comparing cases state NY population NY city. basic point probably right, though. likely 20-something percent folks NY infected, enough drive Rt 1. reminds Chernobyl, main character explains runaway reaction. countries right wing news propaganda problem hard time dealing Covid-19.

Upstate NY March, obits local paper column people dying 50-62. single one classified Covid. one. 

That’s normal.  agree: seeing gotten thinking must range hard-wired human response pandemic. 

Especially “first-world” countries among middle-class / affluent accustomed (at least illusion of) control / agency. Along lines (random examples): buy Volvo, I’ll safe accident; live “good” neighborhood, I’ll safe violent crime; perform well job, won’t ever homeless.

They least feel though choices allow control. Now: pandemic chaos ensues. upends world view. 

Probably us going “Stages Grief” (denial, rage, bargaining, etc.) loss illusion agency. Grandparents busy lives guess. Nanny 6 parents could longer afford her. big question remains, reinfection issue?

No issue reinfection virus, say, basically nil. Every single known virus extraordinarily low reinfection rate. reason catch many colds hundreds them, many individual colds rapidly evolve antibodies longer respond it. Note reinfection; reinfections occur antibodies effective fighting supposed to. It'd like getting vaccine polio, catching polio anyway (it happen! rarely). 

COVID-19 evolve pace, there's really need worry reinfection. Think way. reinfection significant concern, vaccinations would meaningless. summer Stockholm?

This REALLY triggers conservatives. want go work. 

Homeless/starving = certain death soon

Covid = a-symptomatic/ less 1% death among healthy. who's blame boneheaded move ? Students ? Yes no.. knew better wear mask not.. teachers unless one unknowingly brought virus them.. higher ups meaning school board superintendent principal ? Parents ?

Many americans also dumbfounded ability inflict death, suffering, and, pain upon countrymen. don’t associate people take advantage situations agenda. sides that,that’s mean.

Anyone symptoms treat Covid, unless employer requires test absent. stay healthy stop spread. think misspelled “election”. check city number? website compiling this?

No. need move North Korea belong. Straight away.

Yep. local school district said allowing teachers wear masks don’t want incite demonstrations anti-mask parents. Give two full weeks see explosion cases families. Probably 10x number cases inside school.

Schools daily super spreader events. That's lot deaths either way -- percent population going continue make difficult people take things seriously.

If 300,000 people die, 10 million get sick, going leave 99% knowing anyone died, 90% knowing anyone sick, continue dismiss numbers hyperbole less likely carry precautions.

My family moved different state start 10th grade suburban school. First day, I'm getting bus try figuring paper says go, see kid DECKED side red everything. like, ""oh shit. fuck. kid bout light people up. picked wrong day start school y'all.""

Then realized one else noticed red kid. flexing colors. dressed up. kids school soft. helped get bullied.  Although never personally attacked anyone, acknowledge need satisfaction get it. Good luck According report came day ago undercount 57,000 based deaths since March vs normal death rate period. 

Yes numbers low apparently low think. Okay many died? playing Horizon Zero Dawn PC first time since came PS4. wild how, ways, we've gotten uncomfortably closer dystopian future 3 short years. Lots people wear masks China now, need. \+1 ‘Common logic.’ mixture common sense logic, two always same. 

Have considered actual logic? logic flowing actual science? “Nobody knew healthcare would complicated.” Can't believe retired right Trump got in. We're missing much Gold.  kids go school family member either truly suffer agony die rest world things like actually provide education young people healthcare sick people.

While understand coming from, ""the rest world"" providing education free universal healthcare literally lie. That's statement based feelings, facts. Probably friends alcoholics, dont give shit anyone else. sister like this. Shes bored, wants party. One places. Many countries brought control second wave. Australia second wave reopening.

GET CLUE, RESEARCH STUFF YOURSELF.  REDDIT PIT MISINFORMATION. We're getting murdered, we're killing ourselves. Right- send kids camp put counselors risk, school. Instead, top taxes already paid school, pay someone supervise kids work remotely work, pay babysitter. Working parents screwed. settle seasons change again. They’re uninformed, naive, dense.

Well, one Florida fired data people. Ducey tried cut ties modeling team Arizona State University. Unfortunately problem began 30-100 years ago. School became free day care (not original intent) made easier many social economic changes (so good bad) evolve. Either way, society households decided could treat foregone thing would always there.

Now appropriate dangerous, government little-to-nothing support households mitigate important is/has become, huge problem poverty one side infection/death (and possibly poverty) other.

My thinking every household 2 essential workers society would worse losing many-many simply depend two incomes; supporting could shelter/isolate long possible would solve problem--but state many Americans (where am) seem prefer death disease accept certain period time, people survive without working (and need make less non-essential stuff/services); seems unforgivable sin many minds. I've read domestic US flights stay seat ask use bathroom. take mask eat drink. assume allowed nurse drink abuse rule. yeah, executive order. $400 week unemployment state pay 25% it. defunding social security medicare.

It's EXACTLY want,. they're causing it. ironic.


We see lot civil unrest next 18-24 months (just estimate. ... maybe more? NOBODY knows.) There's saying never expecting man understand something livelihood depends understanding thing. see meaning increase would halved. We're 160k, get 300k we'd 140k increase. halved would 70k, we'd 230k deaths. writer ministroke typing. knows. 97k maybe 2 percent spread it. Warriors Btw
.yep She’s bully. make meth basement, surely could setup basic lab college. alternatives (distance learning) prevent spread deadly disease, i’m it.

which members family willing sacrifice? expect list response. also hard teach/educate child teacher dead too...It's infurating thoughtless stupid people are..In truth, parent's pushing kids go back school stupid, lazy, selfish, ignorant, asshats worried losing ""Alone"" time safety child, anyone else around especially...But soon teachers start getting sick dying, children start brining infection home parent's start dying they'll start singing different tune...They'll still try act like they're kind hero who's sacrificed much get kids school, that's idiots work..It's going disaster next 8 weeks..

Good example. born UK know rather lot NHS.

The NHS founded 5 July 1948. first time anywhere world _completely free healthcare_ made available basis citizenship rather payment fees insurance. brought hospitals, doctors, nurses dentists together one service.

(My American friend got hit taxi London, broke collarbone. recovered, went looking place pay. Hahaha! any! Finally ended accounting section, nice lady told her, ""We way take money!"" ""Pity keep receipt taxi ride hospital, would reimbursed you."")

_Sixty years later,_ ACA absolutely none things. ACA, United States worst healthcare developed world; afterwards, still worst healthcare developed world.

And collapsed like cheap suit first crisis. fewer Americans insured Obama took office - Obama, like Biden, strongly believed heart health care _had_ associated job _had_ profit.

The ACA total failure - designed little possible Obama could score win.

Amazing people see good guys matter obvious everyone else baddies. haha gonna super expensive  One problem heard case community spread people would need educated masks/distance/etc rest world getting used it.

The fact want invest good tracking app well.

Odd... I've heard quite anti-maskers complain humans survived thousands years without social distancing.


Never heard talk ""wine windows"", much less life expectancy much shorter wacky made fake medicine fancy science smart people believe started figuring things out. Yes, exactly. see good news ask person making claim. Anything Trump says bullshit. Fauci much credible, spouts doom time. unrelated. God worked food bank. dont even want know. Dumpsters full fruit, veggies, bread even give away. Tons day past ""best by"" packaged foods too. used take home ton trader Joe's salads... Photo virus go viral expected go viral. can’t get chipped fast enough. Trump deferred student loan payments hopefully helps bit. sentence quoted referring simulation results, real data. scientists making broad assumptions/hypotheticals e.g. explore effect school closure, simulated three months school closures varying infectiousness subclinical infections, either 0%, 50% 100% infectiousness clinical cases""

And despite line quoted, conclusion modeling paper COVID-19, school closures likely much less effective influenza-like infections. said anything social isolation? socially isolated right would highly recommend reaching loved one. ways safely socialize right now. There's probably money justify staying open long. last earnings report great understandably. still bet vaccine given mutations past.

It adds up.

Do get wrong, saying get it. make decision, blindly following recommendation. 7k huge! school planning fraction students come school in-person rest online every day? girl goes school anything close provocative clothing, it’s dress code violation gets sent home. 1 would considered significant number community managed isolation. definitely need keep testing numbers up. convincing argument though. ha...worth negative 9....still line man. te also considered lineman. 40% lineman DEs TEs NFL rosters...thats fact jack. go dawgs.

and add moot, tall people twice likely catch covid apparently...at least according read reddit. sport wristbands either! (You hide weapons, drugs, etc.) rare see competency nation. Go New Zealand! Probably kids cant take care them...

I already know, I'm gonna kids unless career....the school education, ""babysitting"" I'm work. They’re already home. can’t imagine letting kid learn wearing. ah cant wait go back school exact thing happen /s Rest peace man solution 3-4 months ago everyone, mean EVERYONE, stayed home lockdown 3-4 weeks, worn masks opened slowly. yet large number people crying staying home two days going partying acting like end lives stay home family.

Yet everyone whining wondering stay home kids school... pathetic.

You put work can't complain. know it’s yet, wouldn’t trust vaccine made Kodak? Would 6-month supply disposable cameras move needle you? live CA masks required. main non mask wearers I've seen police officers. Hard enforce enforcers refuse comply. Japan seen model handle without looking scientist Germany sure talking about.

Also Japan blocking mostly anyone without Japanese nationality enter country, including work visas residency permits. People talk enough. know it’s yet, wouldn’t trust vaccine made Kodak? Would 6-month supply disposable cameras move needle? house Democrats actually cared, pass bill let Senate Republicans kill it? better yet, pass amount Senate agree today provision money future needed? Funny enough Trump seems one anything getting money people's hands. manuals books say test much! Yep.

I'm trying best save takes long. think that's good point, article *is* specifically California, ethnically diverse state US, well one largest economies world. leader agriculture aerospace, also note influence Hollywood Silicon Valley human society. argument could made fair reflection world. Excuse me? saying Dems right thing? believe it. much controversy virus. Ignorance front center this. co worker tell me, granddaughter get tested someone school tested positive. told hope ok. says, kids cant catch it. told remotely true. responds with.... Bill gates China made virus.... that's knew nice old man dumbass. NYC shut hard. spread fast locked down, huge population never infected. Antibodies show less 20% people virus.

If let restrictions, virus run rampant. numbers low they’re acting like intelligent, competent citizens, everyone immune, absolute fucking walnut. testing it. Next week. ????? correct.

There studies flu confirming phenomenon since SARS2 much deadly confirmation.

However, simple exponential math lower initial dose receive longer takes get level serious problems gives body's immune system enough time beat it. immune system recognises threat race time (unless happen unlucky get cytokine storm). doctor myself, he's exactly wrong lot things predict high degree probability. might one many things. Cell damage viral infections different things. data sent internet enough radiation realy effect people animals matter, spread virus would even physically possible. virus spreads living hosts, animals close contact. 

How would radiation even spread virus? Would wave mass carry covid infectious agents something? Wtf talking about? People still dying heart disease still leading cause death year, likely roughly amount people affected. completely irrelevant fact alarming number people dying COVID-19.

COVID-19 leading cause death United States one point May increasing COVID-19 CDC predicts COVID-19 one top 10 causes death U.S. it. work ER, see patients come oxygen saturations 70’s 80’s due COVID-19 every day. end ventilators. ECMO, use 25 year old, last hear improved enough ventilator. healthy people 40 ok. around 350,000,000 people US, 60% 40, 200,000,000. 0.5% people 40 die that’s 1,000,000 people. 0.05% die that’s still 100,000 people. percentage goes 40. Letting run rampant population stupid thing do. think pretty unreasonable expect old people never leave home interact anyone ever again, especially ends lifetime immunity. likely 50-75% effective vaccine plus masks practical increased availability rapid testing would help us keep precious economy alive waiting improved vaccines.  would keep eyes closed moment entered restroom moment leave.

Things getting better Texas, schools started many places. think it’s much sitting hands saying “if push us answer, it’s no”, right? half would curse standing National Anthem. people probably also sitting couch one looking. could anyone known?!?!? Yeah know care... went DIRECTLY PEOPLE. sending kids school get life insurance money? make sure apply. Sucks poor orphans swear purpose get get with. president put death toll behind him. control gave awhile ago . want groom us become numb death numbers. knew deaths coming. spent time altering numbers spreading lies. more. Viral replication shedding COVID-19 clearly complex matter.

It’s hard enough get PCR positive swab.

Giving people even less sensitive test thinnest evidence people contagious positive result..is reason FDA rules test sensitivity.

Giving people false sense security confidence WAY WORSE leaving wondering.

The proper messaging “You probably may spreading it”. “if don’t it, everyone around does.”

People need relax guard right now, things started trending down.

Giving false sense security encourage people let guard. terrible analogy btw. wont contract Corona 100 times consuming 100 chips isnt correct. would better someone laid 100 chips table 1/2 one chips deadly.

Now that's taking consideration would propagating spread virus traveling opponents' stadiums, nobody making argument. reality lpng enough timeline, people going get it. ""Getting immune"" goal, way without risk dying vaccine. people cautious get vaccinated.

Instead of, know, getting sick weeks maybe dying. sterilizing vaccine

First thing ""sterilizing vaccine"". vaccines induce sterile immunity. means vaccine produces response prevents infection, unlike vaccines give sufficient immune response kill infection prevent happening.


Multiple vaccine candidates warp speed already announced sterile immunity. I'm 100% sure believe inducing sterile immune response since attacking spike protein. lost mocked disabled reporter. stupid fuckers running district plan.  fucks sake.  


That smart girl got suspended. suspend herself. better off, frankly worth saving. Country full heavily armed, mentally unhinged people safety net whatsoever.   hope so, fear want $$$ reason excuse everyone forced buy expensive model I’ve seen Trumps recent interviews. dementia best attack Trump thought keep jail.

(black) gladiators die entertainment masses ... that's jus price bidness. shitshow I'm anarchy prone em distrust US govt day long, even see logic listening entire fucking world saying thing. No, latest estimate 54k. Though I'd argue higher flu deaths way expected much higher given year's strain. There’s pretty easy solution: MACE diseased twat go day. DONE FUCKING AROUND SIMPLE BITCHES. I'm one family masks. grandparent celebrates sees people arent wearing masks. parents completely ignore fact theres proof help, says isnt proof, also done research themselves, anyway. fucking sense. Masks 100% effective? zero socializing? literally hermit? that’s call. 

Why wear mask already things? gives added protection gives others added protection. Exact reason get flu shot. 

The fact still catch Covid flu even precautions. May well get additional protection. Besides Covid vaccine likely come flu season over. point would presumably like drop current precautions taking. That's exactly point bailout expense already paid. Even face clear sources evidence calling bullshit persist. Isn’t past bedtime? Personally would pretty shocked approved FDA U.S. Europe think Victoria ever eliminated people still idiots? Ugh. Produce picked automation already tastes like shit. think I'd rather pay 20$ pint blueberries. Actually I'd rather try grow finicky bastards myself. how? Tap jazz fun.

I’ve never non-fun dance experience.

Dude positive.

Wow thanks sacrifice grandma kids immune can't real.  Money n holding position power motivation open schools (kill people)  I've wondering medical professionals US allow patients swab themselves. need go way back nasopharynx get good sample. 

Unless professional it, likely people squeamish go far they're comfortable with, producing bad result. Im nearly finished online computer science degree stuck country, please let know hiring! One side denies pandemic run pedophile, sides medical professionals also run pedophile. 
Both sides different categories shit but, oh boy, they're shit. 9? border collie pivot tables shocking turn events. \*Homer Simpson pulls side\* 9 COVID 19 cases far.  guess Rush t-shirts out?  make passes EMR software. 

If EPIC died tomorrow would celebrate departure. Sure watched China get burned, saw prevent burns, slow current burn, heal.

And watched exact scenario play Italy.

And New York.

But surely open bars schools everything anyway! Even though preventative things places did, fraction time did, half-assedly, anything all. Right? forgot hs schools general. bad. upvoted? source anything. Plus dont vaccine covid children gonna spread parents grandparents. pandemic, influenza Funny thing happened... also went protesting blm. Packing kids social distance teachers school sounds stupid done pandemic apparently one ""intelligent"" ones lol know Republicans try everything kill Social Security, etc order avoid raising taxes rich. oh fucking god.

GG, fucking USA what? stay closed years virus gone? Hey saved couple lives end right? Meanwhile economy dead, way life ruined. really goal here? Save lives kill everything else? Thats reality, reality sustain shut like short period time. rest world knew they've started reopen. Yeah government really abysmal job beginning, they've done better since. Opening schools necessity, otherwise doom generation far less opportunities rest world. 

Your idea reality, reality virus going around whether reopen stay shut down. Nothing change that. Reopening goal, getting rid virus would nice way rea h goal. Naturally, point there- COVID may new disease, least we're lucky enough far closer been. People twist anything make uncontrollable thing causes fear lives “more acceptable”.

Without doubt. uptick expected. 

The geography 20% important. useful drill local regions, exception, find areas affected previously starting previous regions relaxed controls. find pattern US. 

The best thing follow local guidelines, social distance, wear mask, wait combination natural immunity vaccination make thing past. 

Take solace fact hard hit areas like NYC 1% positivity rate. town pays dues virus, becomes much manageable. Still dangerous! still vigilant careful, math seems indicate city gets 20% virus struggles stay wildly infectious, meaning curve naturally easier keep flat. remember ended Easter?

China. still reporting new numbers. never said over. still chasing new clusters infections.

For reason think lying something even say. Jeez seems like someone needs supply Disobeying authority literally part national heritage. Sometimes that's good thing, sometimes bad. Keeping masks times key, easiest cheapest strategy. increasing air exchange rate HVAC systems adding filtration MERV 13 higher. would relatively fast easy free. I've read estimates would add 10% energy costs schools costs going swapping filters individual classroom. No. hospitals dire straits financially cancel profitable procedures (e.g., elective surgeries), patients sitting ICU ventilator weeks end expensive system.

This EO helps people.

It would extremely bad difficult control narrative folks sit right - Trump took decisive action homelessness help Americans - Dems perceived trying take money families need.

Even herd immunity, still going people getting infected. world leaders going make difficult decisions. 

Personally, think they're overreacting. Per 201st Situation Report (published yesterday), CFR calculated 4% (about CFR notoriously overestimates IFR (which true measure diseases fatality rate). IFR COVID-19 appears 1%, per latest still deadlier flu, significantly so. asking lockdown, personally, think leaders realize IFR high, vaccine out, lockdowns cease. that's opinion, says nothing time scale (I predict things start get better around February). True. like manslaughter neglect/abuse. people (politicians CEOs bosses) proven received health guidelines disobey them, getting toward actual legal manslaughter. [90k outlier, testing fallen, especially hopefully trend back bit probably get high peak.

Even accounting testing drop though, positivity rate also dropping. work fiction. real life. Temporary unemployment middle class mean debt profits banks. Police riots. POLICE instigating rioting. higher death toll hiroshima &amp; nagasaki entire threat .. meh.. USA older lot countries lot sicknesses kills wars. make corona-virus less problem weeks, frontline nurse Sette Buenaventura ignored pain leg order focus caring coronavirus patients. But, doctors eventually discovered tumor, now, leg amputated. 

Buenaventura, 26-year-old nurse Salford Royal Hospital Greater Manchester, told BBC News ignored cramp right calf two months working virus frontlines. pain made difficult walk, Buenaventura assumed side effect long hours spent feet hospital. 


""We every hour help anyone needed us, got real taste level commitment,"" told BBC. ""That working hospitals like — forget pains busy helping people, love do. But, everything comes cost.""

Working virus frontline. Nothing Covid. Pick one. coastal wetlands don’t jack shit communities built beaches barrier islands.

Those serve basically role coastal wetlands.

As long forced fine.  
Sadly think gonna make mandatory enough people vax themselves.   
I personally pro vax ( although also think vaccination adverse effects / kill people rare cases ) would still 4 vaccinations 1 100.000 poeple die it.   
But vax way rushed faith all.   
It take years be-four know safe not.   
If others wanna go take risk force well \* even enough people take vaccine \* pretty girl behind every tree! Repost point they're American tragedies. Yes, typically talk current events demographics/population regarding refer today's statistics, hypothetical future . think pretty orthogonal that. understand US sense must one camp another. Yep. store day way crowded, lady line next complaining, joked “we’re still pandemic, right?” kind sniffed said “well, don’t know that.” 

Didn’t engage further. US 7 day average daily new cases: 54870
US 7 day average daily deaths: 1025


1025 ÷ 54870 = 1.97% Illinois dispensers rarely recreational bud? Everytime I've gone carts available recreational users. think part adult ignoring health point amputation. that's me. literally nothing covid. That's pretty much figuring. Yes absolutely! Boring people get bored. keep thinking busy projects learning new things. can't convince 100% people everything time. always going people believe. Sometimes funny like people believe Earth flat, times detrimental like people believe vaccines cause autism. case people believe social distancing wearing masks. Even death toll rises people never gonna believe matter what. Unfortunately, people everyone else pays price. It’s almost like way make accurate number people actually want understand opposed masks, see 

By way, media misreported similar massive demonstrations Berlin week - extreme right wing groups: that's cheap attempt demonize them. Anti-maskers anti-authoritarian pro civil liberties, exact opposite right wing groups want (History 101).

TIL children schools. screaming go back work spend time kids themselves. Lol good one! familiar term ""clickbait""? God, think I’d scared wasn’t protected! yet, seem bothered even now. covid? have, totally big deal. Granted I’m young, (23). It’s clear everyone besides nursing homes, auto immune diseased people, obese (fuck them) it’s flu. need wear masks, need find vaccine, it’s simply fatal enough population entirely stay shut down. clear, id much rather get covid 2nd time get food poisoning. Gramps notice putting water mains anything?

I can't find actual records happening. Lots speculation Keynes quotes records yet Good luck transferring Yale. That’s told got tested USA gonna USA. ""good luck idiots"". still callous folks won’t wear fucking mask. Remember said flu kills people year ""couple thousand."" used government projects departments create jobs stimulate economy. 

Pouring even money black hole F-35 create jobs, transfer government money directly shareholder class. I’m downplaying, I’m realistic. Studies showing conclusions, children effective carriers comes children adult infections, are. believe? sure, I’m acknowledging learn there’s argument sides. respect anyone takes opposing opinion, don’t call realism “downplaying”, requires assert one side truth false, there’s evidence unequivocally support adults always get infected children. Would trust vaccine made Oxford University that's based previous vaccine already tested safety years (namely MERS ebola)? likely first vaccine available. emotional issue, regardless statistics. simply curious would say based numbers alone bad idea. OP saying could be. power change numbers. power change past events, power change outcomes things CURRENTLY happening. 

Loss life matter time period emotional me. I'm nurse. am. Worth noting second wave Spanish Flu fall 1918 significantly worse first early 1918.

If COVID-19 mirrors that, deaths lot higher. 2.1m higher nonetheless.

It worth noting US plans opening schools across country too. already seeing new infections daily. Spanish Flu actually close schools spring, fall. about? US 4% world’s population 25% it’s cases. justify 160k deaths?!! Nice try. Corpus Christi, TX: 187 INFANTS tested positive COVID-19 sadly one died. Georgia: 260 students quarantine due positive tests/contacts 1st week school. Florida: 38,00+ positive children &lt;17 yrs old. time 440+ hospitalized, 9 died. 

Big yikes. Yeah, fair, acknowledge could taken context.

He's done weird things though, throw first pitch baseball game mask seen side talking people mask example. let I‘d say FDA approves WAY stuff Germany. Let‘s take ADHD medication: actual amphetamines(Adderall), don‘t. guys allowed mix stuff food that‘s carcinogenic, neurotoxic whatever.. aren‘t.

I mean could wrong definition „conservative“ means something like held back, reserved, etc, right? FDA opposite that. 

Please tell me, treatments allowed Germany wouldnt get US? Especially higher risk? never called liar. I'm sure *you* believe since malicious heart suffer numerous ailments. Keep excellent stupidity.    

How ironic point feels like USA going draw deleterious effects pandemic long crazier citizens possibly manage. Right now, they're sabotaging social distancing masks. Next year it'll vaccination they'll sabotage. 2022 they'll probably start sneaking across borders still closed them, since gun violence, feel need validate misery spreading far wide. read correctly, 23 cases aug 5. 9
Cases recent ones. media filled people packed crowded bars.

Pointing social distancing dumb work. See big cases are, even social distancing. Excess deaths probably best way estimate. sure make lot excuses.

And yet, Sweden failed.  I’ve actually taken blaming Facebook. mother, one point, worked infectious disease research lab. 15 years lab last 10 Facebook several hours day, she’s become anti-masker complete denial severity situation. never taught responsible consumer internet content, therefore meme “news story” right wing conspiracy nut shared timeline used talking points discussion topic. makes sad actually, always thought smartest person knew, turns she’s another right wing nut job. yet... NYC likely [got hundreds undetected cases time New Zealand first mostly European travelers early mid January. Yes, NYC acting earlier, say, around time Bay Area started locking down, would saved thousands lives, already rapidly spreading epidemic seeded dozens embers anyone knew it.

Thousands deaths likely baked time anyone thought make decisions. elect Trump Jr. 40% voters voted Trump. can't blame electoral system. Yes, like think it’s result apathy country. large percentage eligible population don’t vote, allowing group people louder voice polls. One glaring things listening narrative many talking points internally inconsistent other. country done. Yeah live vacation town everyone coming ""escape virus"". amount tourism basically higher ever been, PANDEMIC, absurd. completely ignore fact community people live You’ve provided zero evidence. 100% going seeing stuff long-term effects virus years now. whole new batch chronic fatigue syndrome patients. 

One plus might medical system actually takes seriously first time history instead calling everyone delusional hypochondriacs. *face palm* Y'all gonna blame Karens bosees force people work pandemic even could work home. See post comment response to. Apply reading comprehension. Profit? 
They? CARE.

The people see online minority, majority us looking what's happening horror are. scary right now, especially Florida. understand why, little disheartening see many people countries generalizing *all* Americans ""cOvId HoAx NeEd ApPlEbEes!!' assholes see online.

A good 60-70% country asking rest country care well, unfortunately might drag us them. Great stats think stats miss point make seem like Canada half deaths per capita US. countries huge spikes April US trending Canada not. US half peak death rate April Canada 1/50 peak death rate.

Furthermore, US conducting lot tests delayed results theres many positives contact trace. quarantine enforcement mask requirements states spiking cases either.

Wait another 5 months think US 10 times death rate Canada, wish right now.  raise this: need lock again, every fucking person country wear mask we'd drive shit ground live south, majority people follow rules wear masks, social distance, etc. composed state one one different. month ago. embraced giving fuck anyone else. ironic? always use word wrong. 

I'm taking care watch Sturgis webcams disaster porn basement. joking basement. remodeled nicest room house. true. mounting evidence reinfection antibodies diminish. memory cells studies yet, difficult capture clinical, measurable way. 3 percent, .03 percent. Italy whopping 14 percent .14 percent. Maybe instead talking stupid liberals focus ‘easy math?’ skipping normal protocols

That factually incorrect position. America....half us retarded half also trump cult together Lol mom planning trip Vegas next week. Here’s future orphan :(((( You’re ridiculous. fucking clue. don’t use common sense quit laughable theory. 

If many people make trump “look bad”, supporters? Get real. Hospitals enough shit deal with, without trying make trump “look bad”. always fucking excuse it’s joke. 

Think brain what’s reasonable. hospitals aren’t getting money COVID-19 deaths. it’s say, make trump “look bad”, would hospitals get money deaths? Read link posted. got bad news you, buddy. 
This *not* first bad take ring. Yeah, pretty disgusting think it. type government take matters seriously capital flight risk. 

A major component making investment decisions based security. Let's go back people die every year common flu died war. Go figure.""

This could interpreted two different ways. Like this:

""And people (all around world) die every year common flu (250k-500k people) (all people around world) died war (70M-80M people). Go figure.""

or this:

""And people (in US) die every year common flu (20k-60k people) (US countrymen) died war(405,399 people). Go figure.""

Which mean, intellectually dishonest, absolute fucking idiot? Got get every dime there. Can't miss opportunity final time, Saying 3.5% number average person average health weighing risk mortality catch covid mathematically incorrect. explained why. math fine present right context. replied someone said ""live healthy life fine"" crap analogy wrong numbers convince poster scared. 

I already explained, situation, looking health looking numbers infected, 99% fine. odds im okay traveling daily life taking 1% risk i'll fine. Tbh, absolutely im fine actually 3.5%.

Going back chip analogy. 100 chips. 3.5 deadly. choose 1. I'd happy take bet. bills pay family feed. everyone? No. look risk determine accordingly. deem ok odds mortality infection act accordingly whats best safety. However, trying convince people weighed risk scared using wrong formula wrong. Thats posted you.  5 million? US population 330 million, means 1 66 people coronavirus! Crazy ok long term heart, lung, brain damage COVID? 30,000 deaths month? Europeans realizing 300m people live located next Sweden culturally economically similar. obviously comparable.

They not. Regions one country vary drastically. Sweden stayed open entire pandemic, read news, might even know virus. Schools stayed open entire time, exactly zero kids school age died. completely flattened curve, zero deaths per day now. Def ""fully"" open. Indoor buildings limited 50 people schools open yet...but schools limits that's real litmus test since school plan open masks except K-3. someone Europe I'm amazed stubbornness Americans. think one root problems society, appear impartial ""fair"", trying polite avoid rocking boat, end lending credence loonies. There's social pressure asshole. need call publicly shame people spreading shit. Fox doesnt need paywall entirety content paid advertisement. 

It essentially never-ending commercial disguised relevant information. 14 million people 100 new cases. Georgia (for example) 10.6 million people 4400 new cases. Glad know everyone isnt crazy here. take upon keep shape (as former fat guy) keep immune system up.

We pandering whole way life small vulnerable population, instead vulnerable population change way life.

It's frustrating. assumes everyone currently won’t die, go cases outcome it’s around 6% folks, explain good bad away ""It god's will"" therefore never learn lessons. ask people coop long. issues sticking home work understand venturing out. sure it’s right wrong, least somewhat understand. blatantly asking get COVID via actions. Extremes exist sides majority us reside middle. thought headline immediately shortages tests mean mass testing.

CDC says 65M tests done. 19% population. 

I think good number. key issue US keeps testing EU nations quitting ""test anyone"" strategy.

Obviously cases pile countries project sense false stability numbers.  brother still wedding next month older parents, high-risk preconditions extremely old grandfather attending. People really care. Dexamethasone already 'standard care'. friend son's treated it, successfully. kill viruses. limits damage tissues. germany anti-mask rally thousands people? UK letting thousands people airports without checking covid. Stop ""only america taking covid seriously"" nonsense National guard federal thing though, state thing. course sent combat. States request assistance national guard, that's different state military. Forgive link isn’t loading phone (my internet issue, fault) what’s confidence interval curiosity?

I’m guessing used critical value mean rather z values? astronomically higher levels regions within country. subscribe text message based alert system county Virginia things pandemic. got alert late last week Virginia department health utilizing Google Apple exposure notification API roll completely voluntary application greatly aid contact tracing broadly adopted.

There's really informative link discusses exposure notification API works found downloaded app Android play store. ability self report test positive, users system may exposed tested positive would notified given guidance department health steps take. Conversely, another user notifies app tested positive proximity, would notified. personal information gathered exchanged. merely intended really decent tool help contact tracing fully respecting privacy.

The users has, better is. zero chance vaccine available election day. Zero. understand that, would opinion change? 
Its middle August. Phase 3 begun. able collect reasonable data 9/4. time data, election day. violence November.

More like want violence November. Probably “it is” done everything American. Canada isn’t plan B, plan since first worked Toronto 10 years ago.

If I, single person, could anything it? would done already.

Those us see going try anything vilified, screamed at, attacked, killed idiots. One would think Canada would appreciate influx smart enough flee sinking ship. Average IQ rise obesity decrease notably (due deaths caused vast amount unhealthy people choosing change absolutely nothing lifestyle) sorely needed area.

I hope people choosing take precautions ones get affected, going spread innocent neighbors though personal negligence.

Don't ask sympathy rush headstrong death. risk rest us. Wanna bet money that? Imagine curves testing hadn’t slowed. One labs cancel contract couldn’t get reagent. state recently received new test, necessary components work. I’m set move campus later week. don’t think we’re gonna last long. takes groups people ruin everyone. agreed disagreed you. think people want virus contained, certainly right enormous amount power given federal government. However, print trillions dollars can't mandate mask wearing? Two. Right. die ""It time"" ""The good Lord called home"". Christian relatives nice peopme even 8 year old swallow justifications. odd mix 1% control wealth power making ""populist"" appeals uneducated living poverty.

No, absolutely no. thousand people day DYING. Allowing first responders, medical staff, high risk people early access life saving. 

Every month 30,000 people die. harm reduction Australian here. Take comfort fact virus really hard contain side politics would fucked well. assholes disregarding authorities anyway. draconian lockdowns able contain yet. argue really fucked instead fucked timeline fucked. Sure two sources.

This one: 
http://wondermark.com/1k62/ I’m you. gotten scary. around 15% common colds caused coronaviruses. main cause could kept lockdown going would realized payments/supplies people government would cheaper fallout/shit now. “thankfully” mentality helping people makes incurably lazy never work prevailed debate. setting plexiglass partitions teachers well. 

But least mask mandate even hallways. I'm glad this, admit disappointed many states basically dragged kicking screaming whole way.

Nobody ever said absentee ballots fraud ridden military ages ago, seems disingenuous suggest now. 

Really, state leader functioning brain cell discouraging form mass gathering time stop spread coronavirus. problem people care - people believe science.

I know people like 100% convinced numbers extremely reported, think hospitals killing innocent people cash payouts, use stupid logic like ""I know anyone knows anyone it"", think idiotic home remedies vitamins make difference, feel masks another form control.

Nothing people caring, stupid extremely popular. think exerted pressure institutions bend will, CDC, Justice Dept. yes, FDA, approves vaccines use. Nothing US surprises anymore. Dear Europeans, American. Many us care. mercy extremely poor leadership moronic following. Believe really care want care return back normal life. Hopefully one day.

Sincerely 
American small selection popular Christian hymns vividly remember singing church:

What wash away sin? Nothing blood Jesus. 

Some glad morning life o'er / I'll fly away... die, hallelujah / I'll fly away

Are washed / blood / soul-cleansing blood Lamb? Comparing one country another work well. can't even compare different regions within one country, like Italy. Compare Lombardy region far away, difference enormous

  also, virus came China, know bastion leftist ideology.  family tree shows great great (dont know many greats) grandmother sent Australia stealing roof tile. Maybe kind criminals think That's I'm feeling, too. I've wanting leave US since middle last year. planning grad school early 2021. Now....I'm sure that's happening.

I'm looking going Australia. Beautiful sun, water, semi-familiar culture, still US...and now... Jesus Christ. feel stuck. feel caged crazed sycophants concern welfare others.

I'm done US. shit show, want out. Dunno, might discourage masking up. Ideally, best thing would former anti-mask Karens bravely admitting wrong, become ninjas like rest us. mean, that's like spotting unicorn - unicorn wearing face mask made skin dragon No, carrying silliness.

It sad, probably agree, sarcasm needs indicated. poor minority groups socioeconomic classes try participate, US decades voter suppression political tactics statistically guarantee outcomes certain votes. Almost law pro-voter ID security measures disproportionately effects poor minority groups. Gerrymandering also tips scales pro political party charge time well fucks poor people Democrat Republican.

TLDR; United States fucked legal, political, economics systems pro-rich white people. Border patrol? Unless secret service launches coup he's going full Tiananmen Square There's uptick stillbirths babies testing positive Covid. Pregnant people need really think they're doing. population 350 million, virus less one percent fatality rate.  You’re telling don’t understand yet I’m giving information...? I’ve clear numbers mean. I’m simply looking confirmed deaths confirmed cases. Could positive asymptomatic people tested? course. also positive symptomatic people don’t bother getting tested. sake getting tested positive puts category could lead 3.2% chance dying covid. Ok, easy blame America, let's pretend Germany around million protesting last week. Emergency use authorization something FDA’s tool belt use approve products public use trials completed believe potential benefits outweigh potential risks. mentioned approving trials completed.

This actually smart mechanism have, safest thing vaccine-wise wait trials completed. However, know alternative waiting also risky. isn’t bad thing, need aware thing.

The second link works. tried it. You’re afraid it?..... Because, it’s spreading current rate is.

Over half US scared it. someone watching neighbors, community country, state local leadership, loss. suffering twin epidemics stupidity willful ignorance. lack caring others many displaying frightful, frightful COVID-19. Fauci thinks widespread vaccination halfway next year. think things start get better towards end year/early next year groups risk, healthcare workers, teachers, essential workers, etc candidates emergency vaccination. also think monoclonal antibody treatment works we're really good spot, we'll find end year too. now, I'd say worse case scenario halfway next year end, best case months earlier imo always joke unlikely catch twice though, actually tested? virus dies enter body surely antibodies would take care it. Assuming washed hands I'm sure fine People saying NYC flair since June (the protests). probably photos people hanging parks. haven’t.

But right, schools true test. somehow comforting know alone US stupid anti-maskers corona deniers.

I've feeling really shitty living lately morons. That's stupid thing say Announcement vaccine election day. Going drive thru getting meal well going outside park nature preserve one lowest risk activities actually.

I live country handled pandemic well &amp; things never forbidden. forbidden going places groups &amp; without face mask. think data May 18th recent data June 25th, calling people delusional?

Lol 5 million 330 million astonishingly small. It’s vast majority. takes dickheads get everyone sick. Every European thinks that!? Yikes, ( googling Europe total who) oh 19mil, 12 million recovered 734k deaths 75% age 65. Protect older folks sure. said sure many doses yet? thought still trying figure out. happens sociopathy allowed thrive. american would love able get work Visa another country.

So exactly audience?

Anti-covid avoid it.

Anti-maskers pissed angry. principle fired immediately. kid would calling fucking ignorant head. “Disinfecting” doesn’t fucking thing either, that’s virus transmitted. long halls packed kids masks outbreaks going explode. I've curious read yet. link PM something see? Iconic imagery failed state. June 17th. Average age 75-84 years old.
Try again? would shocked AEW made quarantine two weeks. minority moneyed dangle front means-strickened bodies. majority drowned minority’s screechingly loud, selfish supporters. I’m surprised anyone outside U.S. would surprised. numbers exactly you’d expect based stupidity selfishness lot people country. Yes, us best keep others safe, end it’s “America F yeah!” attitude loser civilians idiotic leadership us are. 

Screwing bad American thing do. really true? supposed get code health authority release proximity info. Wait what? People complain wearing mask? Man can't even imagine must like. can't even go store fear hordes morons people wreck town. Good luck Horrifying. Constantly sanatize. Frustratingly. Self isolate. Worsen. Exhausting. Selfish. Maddening. words psyche. need help. need get realize people give fuck there's real threat. got mild form. get aggressive form COVID-19. 

I initially thought person caused reaction. fact two forms virus. europeans think? No. scared know it, serious denial emotional reality it, opposite prudent. formation** *Reaktionsbildung*) [defense emotions impulses perceived unacceptable mastered exaggeration directly opposing tendency. seems really introvert vs extrovert thing.

I see issue staying house much possible till turn year so. bother one bit.

I good company though. No, don't. country adult infants. Kid wont chance imagine Even us care can’t make don’t change minds.

We initially hit hard Michigan, Governor Whitmer instituted strict lockdown measures. Several sheriffs police departments immediately announced wouldn’t enforce lockdown. 

Whitmer instituted stronger lockdown measures. Maskless protestors stormed Capitol, calling “Whitler” walking around legislative chamber big old guns Walmart tactical gear.

Whitmer mandated masks. Multiple sheriffs police departments immediately announced wouldn’t enforce mandate.

Even bullshit, sane ones us managed adhere restrictions help turn things around. went number 3 cases nation state earning response virus (as month ago. may states joining us now). asshats circulating petition recall governor. 

To paraphrase Theoden, one reckless idiocy? Karen? Karen you? People recovering dead England? kill every politician? *adjective tests also cause hospitalizations deaths?

“You can’t that.” Hello Im Europe English well tell USA retarded fat worst country earth???

Forgive english Thanks hint :) Reddit US.

So, governments start approving vaccines, alter opinion anchored politically, would rather FDA approve vaccines satisfy other, presumably less corrupt governments? considered this? worth 30k deaths month you? 


Is government regulator world would trust? Literally brainwashed Deaths under-counted Conservative Gov't way whitewashing distracting incompetence Nobody world locked society. Every country earth restrictions recommendations place people still left homes time. restrictions recommendations varied place place nobody really 'locked down' society. Maybe China came close limited region, that's it. Apocalyptic really seem like  seems type CYA move everybody opening business holding gatherings doing.

""Hey, told parties trips, fault ignored rules. 18-22 year old college students hardly ever follow rules. could known?""  saying everyone practiced proper hygiene social distancing 2 weeks would largely  it. Right away anti-maskers fit 6 months later. I'm sad say, want half thing hit. 

I'll leave decide half I'm talking here. Monday Tuesday actually.

Which doesn’t make better, they’re closing school clean even though surface transmission COVID nothingburger, reopening allow virus best- Spread air. Similar situation here. Feeling quite helpless.

My mental health deteriorating pandemic. Depression, anxiety, messed sleeping cycles. Take care mentally. Consider seeing therapist feel really stuck. actually going enforce tho?  long keep rats burning ship, rest world alright Canadians coming US right now. 1. land borders closed countries nonessential travel. Sure, canadians could fly, still subject mandatory 14 day quarantine return. Also- Canada opening border anytime soon. LD50 relevant that's literally measure dangerous chemical eat. cancer concerns, regret inform reports supported one meta-study looked glyphosate cancer generally. review found consistent pattern positive associations another meta-study looked glyphosate cancers immune system specifically. concluded causal relationship established glyphosate exposure risk NHL, HL, MM, leukemia, subtype human study n=54,251. large, prospective cohort study, association apparent glyphosate solid tumors lymphoid malignancies overall, including NHL subtypes.

Now fair, latter two studies found weak evidence link glyphosate one specific type cancer (though type different two studies, implies positive results may statistical aberrations). possible follow studies find stronger evidence links future. now, evidence claims unconvincing best.

That said, juries scientists. Conclusions determined popular vote people expertise relevant subject, that's kind point. Fake News! link contains data May 18th. Well, they've since may, got cases community control. 

There problems (France, example). part, they've kept numbers cases community low, helps schools.

I'm entirely sure we're arguing. agree realistic now.

My point that, US led scientists/public health experts instead politicians, could significantly less bad.

But instead turned political shit show we're paying price.

Here's hoping science help going forward allowed to. per capita basis US behind several European countries terms deaths COVID.  See I’m talking say arguing bad faith. You’ve completely abandoned “natural R0” argument called making terms one uses. try take words twist them. gone Vladimir, gone I’m Texas - neighbors, friends family mentality. It’s infuriating nerve-wracking. family staying much humanly possible since mid-March. We’re suffering mentally many ways know it’s worth best - us around us. 

Unfortunately feel it’s matter time personal sacrifice, health, reduced nothing absolute stupidity fucking idiots living around us. Mhm Yep. Sorry clear see reserves national guard units. letter command state governor's federal forces. States use national guard state emergency (usually help natural disasters sometimes riots matters) lot us care. can’t anything selfish assholes don’t. Oh yea absolutely I’m also really close hospital emergency. I’m concerned lack concern I’ve heard health care providers comes exposure covid pregnancy. it’s new there’s enough data turn translates “no greater risk wasn’t pregnant” work happy hear doesn’t ease fears public transit kids retuning school full time. one fears American. irredeemably politicized here, new administration would really two choices: continue business usual (a continued public health disaster), take dramatic federal action. potential downsides right thing taking massive federal action include civil unrest, including violence, right imagined. imagine lot. enlisted years back incredibly proud part country. discharge, current administration, corruption avenues, pandemic I've lost faith American entirely. live country politicians lifelong value life countrymen. can't even solve help current circumstances. pay system entire lives people sacrifice things I've given more. That's predicated word ""soft"". actually restrict things shut things down. needs stop making seem like nothing. Many repeat follow tests. think shortage tests yet mass testing time? Nope. president cronies getting daily tests, athletes. Every person tested positive likely one follow test confirm. People prisons hospitals nursing homes get tests, sometimes many. also need tests public catch light/asymptomatic. even close 19% tested even had, covers one moment time. need mass testing get control done. New Zealand went 100 days detectable community transmission.  [There's ACE2 expression sufficient virus land aerosoled. Well it’s like we’ve got Bill Responsibilities. **/s** Seeing post history, really feel you. Seems like desperately trying best make this. 🙁🙁🙁 genuinely don’t understand become partisan issue.

Coronavirus invented increase Bing marketshare. compressed 5-10 year process 1 year think US government requiring vaccine give 50 percent recipients immunity (similar initial Polio vaccine). assume would backlog get vaccine first. Test old rich first... Wait one we'll see then. Get FOXNEWS onboard (and perhaps new leadership push it) it'll easier..... definitely middle though, maybe even little lower school districts state GA everywhere else too. It’s damn mess. transplant Connecticut? part plan. Everything fine. would blown away entire demographic became strawman, too. Yeah let free reign kids it’s culling. determined mutations genes people worse outcomes first SARS may apply now. may evolve species people haven’t yet reproduced start dying. it’s old people dying it’s selection event. oh fuck 260? reading 97,000 students tested positive.

I even see that's possible..... concurrently doubt it. looks like document cases July1st-until past week. would bargain several July. trust administration, hopeful voted out. I'm going school September 7k people, I'm curious see that's gonna play out. Influenza 98% Australia right compared usual season, hopefully holds true us moment. poll. Lets see happens something works 300k+ dead. Mind control chips force use Bing. Now, now, settle down. I’m sure 9 positive cases simply “out context” way crowded hallway photos are. Magic Kingdom: losing one hour 
EPCOT: losing two hours 
Disney’s Hollywood Studios: losing one hour
Disney’s Animal Kingdom: losing two hours 

Not crazy though? Looking massive (almost 2x) case drop July 25. drop 2x bigger earlier day-to-day variation would also ~2x test-count drop date.

How go unnoticed? think dense. one part US building quantum computers measuring gravitational waves.....and others....well, much I’m going print similar “badge” letters:

#GTFO

And say, mam, I’m GTFO agency need get fuck out, mmm-kay? course know nothing non-symptomatic ones 5, 10, 15, 20yrs now. Maybe they'll w/o issues....but maybe they'll neurological, lung, heart issues. yay. DP whole quote whiners. can't handle bad language internet, leave good? I've internet since born. Pointing vulgarity mean need go away, hon.

Ok, I'm out, lol. think US problem outsources pharmaceutical costs philanthropic billionaires. 

What happens next pandemic Bill Gates kids going rise occasion develop public universities various science agencies develop vaccinations future pandemics? linked article? don‘t. masks all. Mind control make install Windows 10 use Edge browser. I've noticed: 

1. sale rent signs neighborhood
2. vans windows covered. someone living them?
3. heavy damaged cars parked neighborhood.

Signs time... damn hard, whole world trying figure fly, things seemed ""common sense"" early turned base.

Remember April seemed like ventilator machines would important piece puzzle? Turns they're nearly important helpful literally everyone thought, really respiratory disease all, that's one small part it. Likewise effectiveness masks distancing looking way higher originally thought, think there's single case anyone US contracting infected surface yet... remember early hysteria Lysol wipes disinfecting surfaces?

I think even good, capable, competent governments challenged this, best ones learned early mistakes, adjusted, improved. worst made policy first tried bend data fit decisions wanted make. Leading cause death behind cancer heart disease USA. risk dying vaccine vs COVID-19 many orders magnitude other. That’s also including long-term damage already seen many cases.

So again, observed *high* risk death (3rd USA 2020) countless cases long-term damage, addition exposing vulnerable individuals disease, also allowing mutations weaken effectiveness vaccine. take vaccine medical professionals testing across 10s thousands people, billions dollars supporting research yet show significant ill-effects. think answer obvious. Oh shit, went middle school daughter. family threw awesome Halloween parties. really great dude raised really good kids.  thing happen South Korea? see. like titanic saw iceberg. someone say today. “After election everything better back normal “. confused meant! friend Brandon says feels normal nobody inside awhile.  Correct. administration smart enough cancel school... students can't expected smart enough throw party. lmfao... FUCK WRONG COUNTRY  general opinion seems if/when America produces expensive rushed vaccine, seems general opinion forced entire population. 
When Russia produces rushed vaccine , LOL tested, public health disaster waiting happen. know . don’t get either Minority fucking mind, large portion either ignorant indifferent. stay home eat savings. long sustainable? saving living paycheck paycheck?

There's needs better options parents sending kids school getting infecting quiting job. Actually best. America becoming worst place raise child ( props 2) significant jobs = healthcare 40 mill lost healthcare along job kids means daycare without school gone. Also public school least one parent cant work( one must stay home) assuming 2 parent home. proven 2 incomes necessity home one child ( never downplaying predicament) Expanded unemployment benefits gone. Meaning get best 40% pay. 30% Americans verge eviction seeing forest trees. probably pretty good things considered. nice evening. CDC, Dr Fauci Pediatricians Assoc recommend generally opening person schools. Closing schools kills people scientific organization recommendation. time guys actually demand workers rights, including normal amount vacation time:

Will never happen long half country unironically refers things like ""Socialism"" think going turn us Venezuela. 

I'm exaggerating, really fucking stupid. embarrassing. general scared everyone else working hazard pay Rejecting virologists favor pediatrician/minister believes sex demons causes gynecological problems American way!

There’s literally good reason think preventive measures, mask wearing seclusion home improved disinfection/cleaning routines home running kids around willy nilly (my neighbor hasn’t taken kid local park pool months) don’t play significant role fact aren’t major vector transmitting virus. 

Not mention shutting schools daycares early because, duh, locations huge petri dishes children make effective transmission vectors. *surprised Pikachu face* lives house he’s wife since newly married. advanced topics, fucking chemistry 101, big name professors something offer you

Didn't

Think lol Dude, get goggles! I’ve heard children somehow less likely transmit

I think that's still really unknown. seems solid contract they're much likely mild symptoms, low death rate suggests.

*Why* case mystery. Kids tend socialize much mom ICU Pretty sure lot parents worried. Bit given good chunk choice possible homelessness taking risk sending kids school keep job, I’m surprised OK it. 

Plus plan. Like happens kids get sick spread it? absolutely will. plan shut back hell open all? 

If country shit together enough support people businesses stay home get handle thing, would OK. ive banging drum anyone listen simply cant conversation closing schools without also talking childcare/supplementary income parents need work forced stay home. education, kids fine. I'm saying, remote super dangerous 6-10 age group. going alter personalities way.

Also, never stated kids ""going die"". simply think going alter personalities way may long lasting effects. Exactly states forcing schools open? asking. thumbnail minute 40 mark video, showing mother child home using testing kit sent. equating US culture human nature prevalent? way believe humanity capable looking countries. reopening schools never children forcing parents go back work. open nation summer. Even worse that, goes ""send kids 8 hours drink wine watch TV.""

A lot goes past ""If get COVID, MAY die. work, run money, starve, die. I'll take chances COVID"" goes ""Shut shut shut kids driving wall. get COVID die, worth it- eternity peace quiet."" Oh I’m worried much do. I’m Canada we’re prepping school... still scratching head short wife quitting job (if made less I’d quit) stuck Hope people condemning BLM riots. Many parents though, refuse take pay cut. I'm single/sole parent eating retirement funds whatever crumbs government throw way keep kids school.

I'm sure there's plenty lower income single parent homes can't outright quit. federal unemployment continues end year, make lot easier swallow. Lmao, downvotes. Guess people mad audacity point flaw simple comment. smh says right statue: ""Give huddled masses yearning breathe free.""

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Well definitely parents/grandparents/teachers going catch children. I’m wondering, say 100,000 kids catch COVID-19, dozen adults catch them? 100? 1000? 10,000? those, many experience severe symptoms death? 

I’ve heard children somehow less likely transmit doesn’t make sense me. would tiny human less likely transmit disease full sized human? third? Koreans experienced 1000 deaths month, would straight murdered president. 1 3 Americans already disease time vaccine widely available suspect. We're 10% infected already. Assume .5% mortality work backwards deaths get lower bound number infected far. feel like mocking making specious adaptations popular slogans. Last year sent 2yo newborn daycare, least one person house sick 2019 around November except maybe total 3 weeks. remember summer rolling around shocked went week without anyone sick. crazy sick everyone got time. finally wrapped 2019 without anyone sick. we're spending 2020 trying avoid sick. Also lost daycare working hard get get adjusted it. sucks, everything sucks, worst thing lumping kids together inevitable house get sick.  sure people think democrats powerful enough shut entire country, forge thousands deaths, cause amount chaos. kids home 6 months gotten sick once... HSA ton money usually spend monthly sick visits kids antibiotics meds need.. 

I took HSA money went got contacts new oakley glasses... finally get spend money me! everyone... 3 dollars buy sip water printer stops. RN, I'm incredibly pro Vaccine really know would jump vaccine immediately approved either. I'm skeptic blazing fast vaccines went clincial trials, vaccine studies take time need learn potential long term side effects them. think glorifying billionaires answer.

Bill Gates company used capital position control markets profit decades. sued several times governments.

Now wants end encryption. force pedophiles terrorists use communication methods. Great. They'll switch something new almost instantly. meanwhile, lose easy access it. stopping pedophiles, reading controlling data.

He worst billionaire. Hell, maybe he's best. would fuck second money. 

I'm glad cares poor people, understand people skeptical motives. part science backs mask usage indoors outdoors? positive words pessimist : ) would never send kids back school. told wife can't online schooling let fail year. want healthy kids alive. Second amendment maybe worked musket musket. care many AR's us have, ain't match preditor drone. Ironic due social distancing measures. People understand bad news realistic good news bullshit happy talk politicians thinking problem go away wish hard enough. Reality going much worse anyone imagines. Lots people (really pretty much everyone) vested interest things turn good. Nobody vested interest bad. say bad, honest rather self-interested. That's bad news believable. signed Oxford/AstraZeneca trial. Hope get chosen. kinda worst possible time reopening schools, right presidential elections. others said politicians trying please voters, loudest/most violent ones ones would prefer masks enforced. really boiling worst case scenario moment. everyone forgot happened africa? kids died vaccine without it. Yes, lets trust Sadly, U.S. could call Obama center-left. European standards he's like center-right Bernie Sanders would centrist. viable Left U.S. politics. seems like realistic scenario US....except starting condition much worse little coordinated effort control it. 


It's really starting feel future country literally rests rollout vaccine ASAP....and plan never (implemented, is. I'm pretty sure number plan A's got ignored) pretty much best way create even super virus, mixing many varieties create biggest wave see next month.

I...don’t think that’s works. escape arm hell lot better. HVAC system slight modifications good, comfortable masks, could 100% in-class instruction minor social distancing place.

Proof? Hospitals operating entire time. Non-healthcare departments like Central Service, Patient Transport, Pharmacy, Blood Bank, Maintenance, Building Services, Bio Lab, Food Service, Environmental Services, Parking Services, Security, operating minor alterations day day. union. Unions bad teachers' unions huge, they're bad. 

Try pay attention Fox Ed, please. Jokes them. Brazil label deaths flu Covid “obviously” hoax. could number 1 would get impression? went pick script day omw noticed ""The Bar"" packed past gym and, guess what? Also packed. I'm done trying understand people. Unfortunately they're ones breeding fastest rates president campaign much wants. Trump president history. Usually president push ""short term results"" envelope near election. That's we're seeing now. Would trust vaccine developed haste? Proper clinical trials would take years. Untested unproven, right minds would take it? think black white. Kids need socialize function parts agree remote first makes sense, time need find ways socialize kids, otherwise they're going concept functioning society like post-COVID. 

Come though, concept functioning society like? like one year limited person meet ups let forget years normal life before. would argue kids ages 12 older still socialice many members previous generations lived remote places, mostly via social media, video game chats simply phone. also like kids completely locked in, keeping schools closed alone already ton good. 

Kids die going school year, parents grandparents might though socializing right fuck now. That's important part. Everyone sub look it. big deal debunks ""rushed"" fallacy. die it? \* cum dollars Well yeah I’d need trust institution developed it, really, really don’t trust specific administration.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* grew watching SCTV constant presence movie screens. remembering seeing movie remembering exists fucking embarrassing! 🦵🗑 Selfish stupid!

It's virus UHC—If people able wrap mind around bigger picture, would realize screwing over. UHC, that's pretty obvious (or be). covid, little complicated, laid clearly , pretty easy grasp: everyone gets sick once, overwhelm health care system. happens, crash stupid motorcycle, severe allergic reaction, appendix burst, heart attack, suffer number medical maladies, going die. one care you. It’s really hard work empathy people rationalize death like that, line reasoning inappropriate heavy contact inherent part football rolling around grass wincing part soccer. can't replaced. need ""data scientist"". need pretty basic numeracy skills. Hello question, serious others would like answer, currently moved back home town actually small village kinda people act like pandemic ever existed believe virus hoax, anyway becasue every place around open, including gym, think would okay go gym took necessary precautions abstain going anywhere get here? Also keep mind one shows symptoms whatsoever although alot regularly go visit city, also never wear masks wear one always treated like phsyocpath Nah, event well thought out. greed pure simple. nameless cogs want keep machine running. long enough cogs keep gong care many die process. idea machine stopping even moment way scarier them. short term least, could give fuck whole thing breaks future. ability read statistics seems gone away.

Including year year excess mortality, seems pop countries high infection rates, significantly exceeds past years Italy Spain, well beyond even officially reported Covid fatalities.

I guess there's single Covid fatality someone eventually died anyway point something, maybe distinction importance human well being? Keeps bong water cold! America: I’m number one covid deaths!

Brazil: challenging me? everyone can. high school student right, anyone would examined professional teams... least teams sense  comparatively disappointing honest it. impression compelled read primary literature part current project, Oxford team leaving lot desired quality comprehensiveness they're reporting, data actually report. Derek Lowe Science Magazine good run-down top William Haseltine's earlier commentary--Haseltine particular top-notch, Dr. Offit even top things Dr. Fauci particular must confess lot us UK becoming little irritated antics Oxford vaccine team, they're making things suspect something good, undercutting credibility media hype overcooked rumours contributing pressers. instead providing sober, realistic, cautious perspective vaccine would likely (if limited) positive effect population, they're raising increasing doubts project overall unfounded claims. Lowe summarised lot sentiments UK concluding paragraphs, whilst updates core objection remains true:

""As cells, text paper says induced cell levels peaked Day 14 maintained least Day 56, real effect booster case. actual data presented, there’s nothing CD4+ cells versus CD8+ ones.

These results, overall, fine – think would impressive come Moderna Pfizer mRNA ones. is, trouble reconciling big buildup British media (and, add, editorial staff *The Lancet*) what’s actually presented here."" (the latter part applies antibody data somewhat encouraging, Oxford team hyped before)

I personally met Adrian Hill, one leaders Oxford team, conference years ago struck hard-driving, energetic earnest fellow who's truly committed believes he's working common good. like heroes Greek tragedies, fatal flaw tendency overpromise underdeliver. understand happens lot right doses, perhaps even desirable quality ex. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs hustle get attention first place, like Steve Jobs, even get capital move next step.

But red flag comes fast-tracked vaccine lot question marks there's lot criticism, even among pro-vaccine pro-vaxxers, process clinical trials (which usually take decade) rushed. want quick vaccine much anyone rollout cannot botched released public find that, months later, key details Adrian team failed report, cut corners--this would dismantle public trust drug vaccine approval process, lead wave new anti-vaxxer sentiment COVID-19, immunisations general, would public health catastrophe. think Adrian's lot good overall, really needs step away pressers hyping timetable, slow down, take deep breath Dr. Offit said, simply ""be quiet"" let data collected. Even takes additional year two so. People terminal diseases live years, it’s big deal people denied chance live, say, 3-5 years COVID. Believed COVID real unfortunately, still caught it. Thankfully require hospitalization I'm approaching week 2 symptoms. I'm ready shit over. virus real wear fucking mask. Lots false postives design drive death rate Korea tested almost twice much people Japan less 50% population bro, wtf vaccine work pandemic going go away Trump used brain January like would mess he's office going mess go school going continue spread virus Someone writing checks month attacked Dr Yan's credibility quote HKU. merely pointed source credible context anything related CCP Seems like underestimate. 

Currently 165k cases April-Aug. 

The next 4 months 165k least. maybe even since current situation much worse April, gave trying contain thing, reopened schools, flu season coming (which kill regular flu seasons people's immune system likely weakened covid). 

Of course, attribute future deaths flu pneumonia. parents summer? Everyone visiting zombie, shit brains. don’t know dropped many states (Georgia) one don’t require masks, schools opening kids crowded hallways masks social distancing. nationally mandated plan stop spread would nice! Great analogy. Fact best aerospace engineers skilled members society fly planes filled people. best scientists health experts tell us stop thing don’t it. possible symptoms could another virus well psychosomatic. Coronavirus symptoms common many things. could relapse. mean 200k parents gonna positive next month? even that, fact person charge want admit wrong (ever) instead double downs stupidity. Thus, loyal subjects follow blindly stroke ego. alarmist, but, worth noting 'mild' cases (47%) required hospitalisation? Schools weren’t open 5 weeks ago didn’t catch school. sad really. ""rights freedoms"" wouldnt even table true patriots would responsible start done could done get control. smarter people tell you!!! tell contributed fight beyond (presumably) wearing mask washing hands? Supporting chinese government committing atrocities. Maybe hit Sturgis next year. Crowd thinned out. Yes. Almost certainly.

Also places schools re-opened second relax restrictions seems showing; especially restricting things small areas--the people go somewhere else bring/take them. I'm open that, seen statistics mean point people guessing. interesting though. personally think US (and UK) taking away countries comparable Sweden terms severity outbreak... country openly little prevent due completely inadequate lockdowns. course, major demographic differences, still notable pattern. Many countries similar Sweden they'd like people believe... Gonna take while, people survive damn virus organ damage they'll probably struggle decades.  everyone gets suffer gets second term huh?

What sh\*tshow. Korea tested almost twice number people despite less 50% population Japan, okay. lol fucking idiot. F we're 1 - 3 generations away farm. Yes, white people back breaking work.  want minimum wage.  Most. Bill Gates done good public health most. online companies frills cremation.  funeral homes. Sounds crude lots people die everyday cremation efficient affordable. it, picked body, week later drive office pick ashes cardboard box. fact HKU Dr Yan's former employer knowledge regarding research (more you), fact OP source Taiwan News caught spreading bullshit conspiracy theories coronavirus multiple times, fact HKU lie regarding Dr. Yan's research. fact, attempt derail evidence whatsoever side. I'm still waiting present actual evidence relevant topic, hey know it. prove point use antecdote. Also one saying life long immunity. South Korea scientisrs studied heavily believe immunity last least year I'll trust random redditor. Excuse really, every one whatever condition even cough, goes Covid. Impossible kind climate die anything else. Covid, even mention 40, 000 per year always die season flu,!
Where now? Hint box labeled Covid 19. Gosh rocket science require sane brain see truly going on. Sane rare Redditt peeps

Get simple clue, I'm world thousands people normally die daily many different conditions. changed death, label Covid 19 link website use reference one curve tools can’t speaking ass.

We need serious conversation UBI paying people liveable wage. government needs make education affordable people get poverty. way worry eviction. really dont get could someone stupid think whole world faking virus trump would look bad. economy country shambles think give fuck president gonna be? arent reinfection rather loss antibodies. Losing antibodies doesnt mean reinfected. cell response matters. didn’t say accounted five times much deaths per capita. I’m saying different countries different characteristics circumstances necessarily case country next another doesn’t mean compare 1:1. rational statement unless ideological axe grind. I'm going keep slightly open mind say reinfection truly significant _within 6 months initial infection_ would see cases already. 

It's pretty reasonable expect level reinfection. common among coronaviruses even viruses ""can't infect twice"" sometimes cause re-infection. Chickenpox example.

The big question is: significant? yeah... agreed. administrators ashamed. kids control situation getting exposed desperation idiocy... believe steroid type inhalers long term issues. Prednisone ones people worry about. using Asthma preventive inhaler almost year doctor mentioned me. Hospitals getting paid rumor. get paid costs treat covid patient. hospitals could maybe want make numbers, tests typically go labs. unless hospital running lab, there's like 0% faking numbers. Also feds would get suspicious hospital reports lot cases many deaths makes even harder fake. patients families getting paid anything except life insurance. “Haha imagine believing news Wuhan”.

/s Yeah fuck Chinese people supporting China!

Lol latter. misleadingly titled. read article. found worthwhile. explains different types tests, pro’s cons.

What know virus cause significant damage multiple organ systems. 

While immediate death might happen...it's entirely possible entire generations humans could crticially affected.

Earlier, brought HIV/AIDS. atypical person die first contract HIV. However, certainly die HIV turns AIDS.

The rationale applies. know know long-term effects virus? don't, don't.

Anyway, throw rock pack dogs, one yelps one hit someone dies know they’ll call god’s plan Janitorial, dietary, classes recorded repeated thus teacher, lawn maintenance, school buses, etc..... obviously pay teachers enough people intelligence level outcome wear koolaid sleeve. Europe took seriously, USA didn’t

I see problem. literally understand US government works. Spend time researching difference state federal governments. federal government limited range power, that's design. Read article cited earlier (which tell obviously read responses). provide point military control pandemic. meant highlight difference federal government EU, two different things different scopes power. ...with 5.5% kill rate. puh🤪 Yes. safety depends others. Ontario, phone app. lets us know near someone tested positive. think using BC too? sure....one western provinces organic foods pesticides sprayed like Glyphosate, ""regular"" foods pretty obvious one safer. Look governor Oklahoma. Maybe will, going take alot us them.   Well, chance blew it. Oh, couldn't. 🙂 actually like *Breaking Bad*. 50% fail come attend large gatherings? risk contracting slim none - yes, antibodies wane, cell immunity lasts reinfections widely observed. Panhandling thousands wealthy people homes give shit mask mandates unless cops give stink eye.



Until cops give people ticket arrest mask, idiots play stupid games.


What city's need pandemic thousands people giving shit. said **idgit**...haven't heard decades. Thanks nostalgic interlude. know give fucks. see based upon complete ignorance current issue.

Once again...vote Democrat November. may smart enough stay informed, least vote someone think issues you. 

So shoot foot like Republicans do, cry Democrats.

Help help you. ""It's become immune herd. know, like herd cows. ever seen cow before, idiot???"" Glad MLK Jr. take attitude. Lol no, course not. ever evolving situation. even require denialists expertise knowledge subject. climate change piece CNN back brought Rick Santorum comment. researcher field. expertise science climate change. literally reason call except paint discussion ""balanced.""

Real balance would asking Santorum overwhelming majority climate scientists disagree physical evidence skepticism.

Our news media circus meant entertain distract people. meant inform anyone. working intended.  Probably studies show ~50% cases never get diagnosed Eyeroll. ""Care"" exactly America's strong suit. They're pretty selfish assholes part. trust Fauci says. gets live tv even better. ""It's hoax dont see?"" /s Vote. Don’t vote Trumps Biden’s... vote fucking science majors. PHD laureates. Jesus, guys, it’s hard. vote career politicians, criminals sketchy fucking people that’s you’ll get running country. good majority us do...it's rare medical condition one. care,and shame many selfish,and respect realize value human life. Everyone become numb numbers,5million cases? many deaths,the permanent damage others recover facing.... Oh dear lord need miracle! Swede surprised every time go reddit, nobody wears masks here, everyone partying, bars open usual, distancing isnt really thing anymore either, like what's even going on. lot people thread running wild unfounded perception 30% discrepancy meaningful evidence counting virus fatalities. simply trying dispel incorrect perception. agenda. necessarily think opiate deaths explain it, concrete example societal changes invalidated year year comparisons.

If US's 30% discrepancy information value, simply tightens upper-bounds kind counting might taking place: zero counting possible discrepancy, order magnitude higher not. divorced real world. places excess mortality indeed order magnitude higher covid accounted deaths. low sensitivity metric useful, detecting accounting gone wildly rails. Even mostly useful starting point investigation, very, crude metric own, unimaginable confounding variables, pointed skew either way.

Earlier year totally convinced Canada missing covid deaths discrepancies excess mortality ranging 20% 300% across different regions. believe mistaken due lack appreciation crude metric is. Western Canada clearly opiates. US months ER docs warning people coming early signs heart attack. imagination limit types confounding variables world unrecognizable year ago. don’t know we’ll come together either, hope do.

I didn’t follow closely cdc statements beginning, unfortunately science isn’t clear cut right away, takes time discover answer sometimes wrong answer seems correct first. time seemed social aspects people freaking go buy masks tho. even basing guidelines think people react. don’t recall podcast listened to, Dr. Fauci said eye protection likely wouldn’t become part recommendation people believes people would push back even masks might make people even less protection. despite believing eye protection would reduce risk cases thought caused virus entering eyes. really wish people charge would give honest recommendations, people wouldn’t freak rush buy stuff, indeed far better people let hospitals Ppe wasn’t enough supply. Seems like feedback loop trusting us bend truth flat lie, don’t trust them, Someone tell wrong please

Observation: spread virus substantially reduced covering mouth nose public

Conclusion: ""You hate freedom!"" remember, supposed ""Christian"" nation. honestly astounded keeps getting worse administration somehow still refuses see much screwing up. hope somehow held responsible. freakin ridiculous. Here's novel idea, instead trying stop dying because, we're mortal death part existence, instead go back living sick.

Keep mind 'flattening curve' saving lives, keeping hospitals overrun, accomplished large. point would far beneficial resume 'normal' lives deal COVID-19 cases come in. Right damage economic mental health people country getting point cause greater loss life COVID-19 will, passed point already. I'd say 2/3rds country care. 1/3rd vocal controls much wealth power. Good question Pepperidge Farm remembers. Ask many cancer patients he's sent ER successful chemotherapy. going go exponentially. Almost like Georgia’s fraud governor trying kill people. make asshat hall monitor without ppe entirety school day. gives shit? even much work none old geezers wearing one pic  Thank giving time putting harm's way.

And assume apathetic. asked would vote. Apathy strong many make difference like 2016. comments? fake? 
The headline - sorry - write it.
The interview Prime Minister, Erna Solberg. 
Yes, said, actions correct, harsher necessary. I'm struggling find word ""slightly"". conclusion - acting fear thank god Lol america death cult. come here. Stay Europe us patriotic understand needs done tread values...while others fetish ""freedoms"" zero empathy others complete selfishness objectives. It’s definitely this. mom isn’t afraid anything could kill she’ll “just get meet Jesus sooner”. Even another great gran way doesn’t sway her. doubt actually bracing themselves. explain herd immunity bank account 2nd stimulus reads, 0.00 Ask many fucks give? This. nothing happened aftermath Sandy Hook dozens children murdered school, gave hope country may left. sick society. Majority us do. vocal minority fucking us. matter, man's death shows death possibility employees schools one reason schools open. teachers, principals, custodians, bus drivers die schools open Even mild cases never recover disease. effects long term even permanent. 

The severe ones die. think understand karen meme, Karen. Canada.......yes, masks make difference. Social distancing makes difference. fun, means slow down, that's tools available. me? me? exactly I'm one know taking seriously US. Friends family think I'm wackjob point, I'm like, science literally tells stay fuck home away people. Meanwhile, dumbass cousin scheduled newborn's Christening end month. ""That could never work though, America *insert noun here*."" Tying healthcare employment biggest folly. Right now, temporarily uninsured pandemic. stopped working, however. contract working switched new company. keep working, switch companies. miss day work, change employment created gap insurance coverage. Even taking measures onboard us quicker, I'm losing least 2 weeks coverage. Add that, new insurance accepted doctor, find new doctor, need new policy place so. angry this, literally control whatsoever. know case numbers high test more??? /s Survivorship bias. one care people. however maintain social distance, wear mask wherever go, hell wore two yesterday eye doc since know close, usually hold breath I'm walking past people can't maintain 6ft. play game well end I'd rather let virus run course. think is/was worth shutting economy for. We're going paying looong time. People going die one way another. kind like idea world wide culling leans towards weaker population preexisting health issues rather something like genocide reduce population. many people, everyone says thinks there's many people. 

I kind flip back forth thought I'm feeling time. 

My heart go cashiers though. get see worst population giving flying fuck. working gas station start amount people leaving house buy $1-2 lotto ticket, single adult beverage disgusted me. mention organic foods expensive essentially quality. parents saying that, like intentionally flout social distancing stupid shit get virus, shouldn’t later come crying hospitals take resources. thing dangerous unnecessary expeditions like climbing Mount Everest alone without equipment, well good okay choose get hurt that’s search rescue teams used try save people recklessness people live normally still run danger… person truely everything going well easy, put pressure things difficult soul revealed. strangely us assholes district starting virtually lot teachers campus. Already positive cases several schools, first official day Wednesday. took 3 days!

School won’t happening places US. try lot people constantly falling ill quarantining first weeks finally call it.  Well, Trump team botching test, that’s certain. words “Covid” “botched” don’t even belong sentence speaking current US administration.

(/s) Sigh... *guess* I'll take 2.5 doses bring average. moment became political people came woodworks blame deaths 100's thousands deaths left wing conspiracy. think there's something better lying confuse gullible people. flu vaccine essentially educated guess strains prevalent. really really well researched one, get wrong. bad enough I'm actually considering walking job. really know do. stay I'm exposed fucking plague rats, go lose money everything own.

This entire country fucking sick, like virus got here. Minority percent? much. That's awful. time get vaccine general public USA, like 100 thousand people already vaccinated months due phase 3 trials ( think oxford got like 10000 30000 + volunteers least 3 countries plan vaccinate UK trials end). So, see US public getting anything available like spring 2021. Even gives fever week, I'll take covid possibly organ damage survive.  I’ve watching Snapchat - wow crisis moves quickly, can’t wait studies tell us information. We’re already seeing spread schools, we’ve seen spread house parties attended high schoolers, we’ve seen spread summer camps daycares, etc.

That’s scientific data, don’t need scientific data say “hey, maybe shouldn’t jump head first person schooling right now”. looks like election campaign. 
Trump said go countries country bad let you... fault, ""did good job"".NOT! RemindMe! 30 days ""check Covid data"" V Vendetta Sure die car accident getting struck lightning. Many states handling fine. Without national leadership, impossible go 50/50. Hey, well, good thing worry anymore... Take care people. time try drop weight, stop eating fast food, regular exercise; TIME! war torn country.

Quiet! give 2020 ideas! :( Please stay indoors then. Except happened summer camp Georgia. Like last week. Talk memory gold fish.

It's funny following sub, know scientists. decline vaccine, also sign rights health care get sick. premiums double It’s tough bubble. don’t even order food delivery cooking home since March. Instacart-ing groceries, giving soap scrubbing jobs putting away, quarantining package deliveries 24 hours, longer plastic envelopes, even putting masks pick groceries dropped front door it’s aerosol linger hours air people huffing groceries without masks front door doesn’t feel safe wear one. Maybe we’re super paranoid top I’d rather safe sorry. Yes, I'm furious, response awful. Yet, counted 200.000 cases. That's amount deaths U.S.. Actually [has link Covid cases protests. 

Ah yes, Fox news, known accurate unbiased reporting. Nope, even going bother read headline. Provide proper source, preferably assuming protection? students teacher wear masks. 

Many states require people wear masks public. little chance going number people hallway given time. Stagger schedule minimize contact classes. Separate desks within classes. hard enforce.

The average class size America 21 students. room distance students other. schools countries pretty much closed infection rates high. Every year kids bring home sickness school. Strep throat, common cold, shits... no, covid different. contagious virus ever anything /s thing midwest unlike states like Florida, Texas, New York California several big cities, mostly countryside small towns mostly villages.

People areas community mindset fair number never left state lifetime. probably never left county. probably care outside world might shrug covid result.

The cases deaths areas fewer New York, California Florida thats much lower sparser population. example, Wyoming (the least populous US state), 50 deaths per day would equivalent 1,810 deaths per day Florida. need go hospital die living room. would think connected deteriorating mental health, issues like depression stress. Get trustworthy local business then. make yourself. Nukes. Canada cares little event lol hundreds gather without masks nightly Portland happens you—oh, don’t know—*politicize* pandemic. Imagine much privilege. happens generations go without experiencing pandemics. lIkE 12? BrO? evidence rapidly emerging aerosols generated even breathing. Science slow confirm things conclusively studies increasingly showing this. Given consequences that's true probably one times proceed caution definitively known. burden proof lies ones making vaccine. know trials exist reported go well, lower quality evidence vaccines.

Combine anecdotes past rushed vaccines serious complications, can't really blame people skeptical. Please tell Americans supposed prevent hurricanes? Get medical degree, maybe we'll give comments consideration. *It already here.*

You jerk moaning racism want told bans work, especially shitty unenforced ones, needed ramp mask production yesterday, needed consolidated national response go ignore every last word assumption make disingenuous racist? 

Get real. hope got joking. personally believe it’s totally selfish bring kids world right now, kids need smart, communally socially conscious people who, statistically, fewest children.  Maybe live do! Wait, TX CA it? F states Yeah. It’s fucking 100 year pandemic, shit. Yeah I’m gonna get it. much controversy. last breath pray Trump cast ballot 2020. Likely many orders magnitude resources. company alone donated simulation software hundreds thousands hours hardware accelerate search vaccine researchers across world. Best point one make. tree fell two days ago. would upsetting 2020... I’m happy alive. like 12? parents permission online? They’re supposed though. That’s confusing. sExIsT Teachers also work 190 days per year. Factor thinking. teachers worked entire calendar year, would making 60K-90K per year. 9 cases though wouldnt prove skeptics least partially right?

They still close two weeks, wouldnt expect lot cases? That’ll fuckin it. cannot open schools back up, especially hotspots. 

We’re asking teachers basically die fucking jobs. hope got joking. personally believe it’s totally selfish bring kids world right now, kids need smart, communally socially conscious people who, statistically, fewest children. Yes yes know dealing coronavirus patients also could’ve cashier store working double shifts. tumor leg ignored. That's really good point, denial first stage grief model. Unfortunately public policy also seems stuck first stage many places. welcome! discovered trick accident one day still evidence children 10 less likely spread older kids adults. said, seeing soon real life true 😣 ... guess depend quickly suspend particular experiment revert minimal in-person school. starting agree. skeptical too, unfortunately. bad leadership does, lack trust time crisis. put n95 solo trips grocery stores keep kids indoors winter reevaluate things around March. assuming deaths added Covid death toll. wife went ER last night. thought heart attack. Every thing feeling followed symptom list heart attack women. examining determined panic attack. She’s working nonstop trying get something ready school year, putting 18-hour days trying find new ways designing curriculum teach COVID era. damn panic attack. chest pains, trouble breathing, pains arm, etc. us teach, family dependent us going school week. She’s panic attacks. I’m livid. There’s way social distancing going work, many students. There’s way student going fill ‘COVID symptom form’ day get school. There’s way kid going get temperature checked walk building. 

It can’t work.

I want life get back ‘normal’ much anyone else, everything I’m seeing happen diametrically opposed reaching goal. seeing serves drag long possible. Instead letting wound heal constantly ripping bandage keeping wound open. “Most people myocarditis recover completely, either without treatment, lasting symptoms complications.“

Again. downplaying risk. clarifying myocarditis *can* cause lasting issues, synonymous large chunk US face eviction crisis, savings, barely able find work.

Talk billionaires. rest us great. it’s don’t read country! FREEDOM! think 300,000 dead December start helping encourage people. Especially children start getting exposed more. mention yearly, people begging vaccine. 

It’s amazing selfish we’ve become since people us suffer without vaccines 1000’s years since we’ve never deal privilege state won’t take vaccine. maybe cause price say would free poll? That's scary numbers though. I'm taking day comes out. oKaY bRo? one burning cities abolishing law order. minority idiots causing trouble yes, extreme. right-wing idiots pulling stupid shit also extreme. I'm talking ideology extreme thinking based narrow view reality leads needless conflict. deny existence influence bizarre. looks like schools going magically COVID-free places appeared. Yes, kids get spread it.

At point, ethically dubious keep sending staff students signs point problems. absolutely agree viral load, clearly factor case severity. sons case could easily picked wearing mask, eyes, way. jump conclusion mask responsible severity symptoms completely unfounded. He’s also encouraging people get train (Yamanote Line) together without wearing masks. He’s nothing terrorist point, go jail immediately. forget global issue. need *everyone* get vaccine train. Agree. bone cancer. Even went Dr. 6 weeks earlier, probably still would needed amputation. That’s good description nope won't. next week start testing travelers. parts holiday already over...a bit late opinion. Also startet schools...yeah cases go like shit.... beginning pretty good job what's going atm make us bad america doing. maybe bad pretty bad Risk went down, up. Meaning already hotspot plenty evidence Italy did. 

Can provide source then, since evidence US lockdown Italy.

Also, source this, please Kids still school, safely internet. heck many people want throw kids burning building? get it. course I’m accounting people got tested, I’m also accounting people died... people dead covid accounted for? - *trump* Ouch, 114 downvotes hour totally unrelated comment. Talk politically biased subreddit lol dozens us!

Dozens!!! like evolved lethal strain like Spanish flu did, reinfection possible? Whilst may moral duty also inescapably true may impossible without bad consequenses. way done issue, whether done all. maybe area's still enhanced lockdown example. agree. I've also heard many people sub advocate thing. completely insane want us live like forever. caring Covid patients due astronomical number hotspot, worked double shifts help, ignoring leg pain.

It’s corona related lot people claim it’s flu whole hospitals beyond max capacity healthcare workers suffer due politics stupid downplaying pandemic making worse wearing masks etc. It’s met incredulity too! Motivated, 'with predetermined motive', think. opposed unbiased reasoning. Take politics account might end something introduced might questionable. Make mistake end approval vaccine short time ultimately political decision reason enough least concerned make sure make proper informed decision. would increase capacity make money. area, capitalism actually works long incentives correctly aligned. 🎶 Test less. Smile more. Don’t let know million positive or... four... more.  UK US population seem become much similar since Trump Brexit... gloves restricting fingers, suppose enjoy life? okay bro? Need help? Well don’t go hospital they’re busy dealing lethal virus might time stop deal Butthurtitus. mean agree 100% that. wasn’t trying anti mask anything, I’m teacher worried returning. 

I replying post must misunderstood guy, thought trying pit Fauci’s word Fauci. come lady thumbnail giving nose swab isn’t wearing mask? sad. must address obesity crisis. 10% infected already

Gonna need source parents even sending school seeing pictures? Keep mind conspiratorial though. people die surge normal things due medical inattention. people die never knew it. places report deaths differently within reason (even political reasons one side reasonable spectrum other) plan stop it, like wearing masks social distancing. wonder? Would work? confused rival Gays Times Wow yet don’t care privacy plaster kids faces online school function. Wtf. Skeptical without factual based scientific evidence. They’re skeptical based emotion anecdotal evidence. Skeptical fear don’t understand. didn’t even know vaccines phases experts what’s safe, rushed unsafe. think learned behaviour from? revenue hospitals probably up. 75,000 Benghazis conservatives reading Let Darwin thing Looks like teaching staff dying huge numbers, schools end closed staff left teaching. way things right now, need tell ppl wear masks danger. knows happen everything scarce 😑 No, people take things lot seriously. People won’t consider “bad flu” then..z listen beloved Leader tell us vanish soon.i like feeling encouraged like I'm right. “Don’t care health?”

""Nope! Sturgis baby! 2 1 beers Senor Froggies! Owwwww! "" remember back December telling friends new virus found China Bro election fucked go back try reading again, we’re homeschooling trying work full time. life insurance policies we’re responsible adults. Thanks asking. user saying it, also heard multiple Conservative anti-Democrat lefties making jokes people believing thing COVID depends political affiliation. believe obvious reasons, since world full bad surprises wait see people like this. Oh come on. Nashville filthy antimaskers theory people believe mild case give people mild cases. Trump lies. factual numbers CDC. That’s plain stupid. country taking Americans right now. Ireland fixing get banned traveling within rest EU. one band _considering_ seeing end September first time ten years performed Europe (Aldious). However, small venue, UK cases currently relatively low, normally sit disabled area anyway (I can't stand long periods) keeping distance people easier. risks, depending things go then, seemed manageable.

Thankfully, rearranged March. definitely Boston immediate areas though. I'm Somerville trip Plymouth area yesterday half people wearing masks - obvious political divides people w/ masks people without... Lol ur politcally driven u want know symptoms affecting them? people actually masks misinformation social media causing this? Totally anecdotal work multiple nursing home 90% residents tested positive ~25% died I’ve heard that’s pretty typical nursing homes state. basically vulnerable people died around time mean that? NYC pretty good schools..... would vote guy called xenophobic, fearmongering hysteria January? Kinda proves universal suffrage may great idea. OK, galan77 overstated 450k infections, apparently 225k, according NYC Health Dept. 10x multiplier aligns seroprevalence studies referencing.

Clearly he's prone exaggeration, key point? 20-30% NYC showing antibodies sources, think that's huge advantage reducing spread?

ETA: all, Dr. Fauci recently say 50% effectiveness vaccine would enough get control COVID - even expected 50% adoption rate? line 20-30% seroprevalence terms effective immunity? (50% people taking 50% effective vaccine = 25% population immunity). least experience, two friends desperate kids get house two parent household one stays home. Although doubtless right many cases, last two sentences definitely true. y'all read story Minnesota Vikings player discovered major heart issue covid? Turns out, Bicuspid aortic valve since birth. Docs say wouldnt lived much longer diagnosed. heart attack died, every single last one yall thread woulda jumped straight ""It obViOuSly COviD kIlLed Him"" 🥴 rather waiting autopsy report come in. really sad see many people fear mongering like this. think end august get results approval September/October So, say Democrats wont compromise, really saying Democrats wont agree full stop Republicans everything roll over.

I think know word ""compromise"" means. getting others ""breaking law brazen ways?""  always point actually care one thing time. Yea retarded libs idea they're shouting about. guess? sure Fozzy dumb before, know.  country founded rebeling authority

The part hurting us right sneering anti-intellectualism passed egalitarianism suddenly doctors epidemiologists par loud republican businessman. like opinion. rule 20% theory definitely need science back up.

You right. shit show last month. amazingly able get today without locking down. Amen that. one take us :( 

I students family New Zealand looking options. give fucks , pussies. /s almost tons people dying effect economy!? almost going suffer massive economic damage regardless whether open not. major difference lot people end dead. give u loads upvotes would I'd problem teachers discretion enforcement.

Most kids care, get hang it. may forget others. may ""forget"" time.

And teachers police masks day. every school I've ever heard dress codes teachers enforced degree. believe disease, ain't letting shit enter body mess health. sure hell letting shit near little brother bad health problems, cuz probably gonna kill him. Also, hear vaccines? pretty much made fight shit mother nature throws us. I’m Santa Barbara town full tourists. Everyone upset virus control months ago. Awesome. Stand ground. A++ remember drug made Germany gave massive fetal defects. girls born moms took vaginal defects weren’t discovered years. Talcum powder gave knows many cancer. Oooh recent times, fear HPV vaccine could cause fertility issues market years. remember one polio vaccines got contaminated live virus. I’d say risks minor. 

I pro vaccine. Pro recognizing risks brand new vaccine especially it’s rushed. mean, far popular vote though, like small minority wanted president. Like 50 million adult people. lot morons. people shut herd immunity holy fuck.

No UK isnt reaching herd immunity. country is, localized areas are, like even cities, like city areas. summer generally slows spread coronaviruses Got mandate masks close dine restaurants bars. That's way would delay payments sent out. would horrible delayed (it constitutional, money CARES act leftover expenses FEMA disaster relief). People homeless politicians try take court (because want cut) 60-70% us care.

Unfortunately president one 30% doesn't. ""It is."" Republicans want one trillion. get American people relief. Go 1 T, get cash assistance negotiate later. must nothing? Also, Biden gets take Senate pretty much whatever like least 4 years. time strategy short-sighted petty. guy 2 masks him. given warning. refused put mask walked away. came back place 90 minutes later without mask. actually surprise homeless person brazen stupid? Look bright side, least Trump charge ebola hit. It’s design internal AC unit. don’t furnace. It’s old design frankly sucks (like almost anything originally made 80’s), coils drain pan connected together. I’ve seen part, it’s something partially replace. previous part replaced 2 years ago, 1 year warranty. Frankly, likely need upgrade entire unit, 15 years old getting hard find parts for. we’ve quoted $9k+ couple different companies, that’s happening year. care, enough means nothing. I'm still part staying home, family members drank kool aid give shit.  Yeah. Unfortunately seem minority though. American, I'm fucking embarrassed. Also ""I take responsibility all"" Agreed, Cuomo certainly isn’t hero, height pandemic didn’t ease red tape allow makeshift hospitals take patients, reports doctors getting paid sit phones. also sent post care patients back nursing homes.

Desantis better job much older population yet seen villain. disagree optics. Republicans trying spin way course; always do. I'd honestly wonder getting *didn't* try spin way. However, pretty obvious refuses compromise. I'm even paying super close attention right (because bad mental health) see obvious is. President give fuck neither supporters Times briefly thought serious indications slowing

Have looked data last two weeks...? messed up, reading post pissed badly. son *(and course teachers kids)* deserve much better. 

Browsing thread like this, like reading sort dystopian novel me.
My country pretty much fully open *(only things still closed things like nightclubs)*, expecting cases rise, roll back opening phase need be. 

A days ago, new case count/day rose 23 per million inhabitants, immediately started debate whether schools still reopen Monday, summer break *(they open summer, loads precautions)*. 
They still reopening, except localized hotspot, whole school waiting teachers students get test answers back. Thank god usually takes days *tops*, likely 12 hours.

I know help all, wish lived here, would better pay/working conditions son could safely go school - mention free healthcare both. 
I’m really sorry things shitty - hang &lt;3 article, original comment, risks children spread covid infections others, school home. guess understand numerical facts death counts viral spreading. care. It’s idiots running show followers ignorant. country fucking hopeless we're stuck watching burn

Until November. could see Trump deploying CBP liberal cities loses. episode basically religion. Peanuts deadly others. something deadly mean lie effect individual. We're extremely lucky virus deadly. supply chain would stopped us would starve death. Taking virus seriously important even deadly there's small portion citizens die it. literally stoppable. Italy become ""the model virus containment"". sub become politicized past months.  way keep Yanks killing us all...if only... guess arithmetic yourself.

The paper says 40-60% previous immunity. models beginning said 60-80% immunity required herd immunity. So, add current 20% people NY infected, 40-60% previously immune, get total immunity 60-80%. Herd immunity achieved. (It's good news - downvoting?) attain

I think got meant government pretty much grocery stores area require masks feel pretty safe going early mornings there’s maybe 30 people wholesale store like sams costcos.

i hadn’t haircut since january caved bought clippers shaved everything, figured one gonna see awhile anyways 🤷🏻‍♂️ America ignorant selfish. Terrible combination. Ok ... know consequences Brexit occur end transition period, right? Nothing changed yet we're still transition period. 1/1/21 everything changes. Potato potato. That’s am. self isolate around 90% time able wear mask, constantly sanitize wash hands leave food, gas, etc. 

It astounds hear friends going vacation right now, eating drinking bars restaurants, trying parties low, etc. People frustratingly selfish stupid. 

It’s honestly horrifying frankly exhausting witness sidelines safety home. Every time venture worry dumbass gonna get loved one infected don’t care follow rules. people acting like it’s “over” things going worsen come fall direct result insubordinate selfish behavior. Maddening. park ranger end undercover stripper? Better healthcare

'Bout time get universal healthcare. employer-provided, something better. I'm loss help. love country seeing fall apart front infuriating. help? educate? positive things help country? AIN’T FIRST, LAST. WOOOOO! Remember Pizzagate? crazy conservative friends FB heard virus hoax distract ""real"" issue underage trafficking. apparently also another reason mask pedos kidnap children undetected. saw videos memes change minds. wish making actually believe shit. Singapore

We National day today huge crowds

I’ve noticing loads people wearing masks past weeks too, I’m starting see largely American argument resumption activity online Yes. Given Trump, would react.

I'm shocked muzzled CDC successfully like couple months clear would happen. republicans would pretend one side political debate deranged defective whims madman. SF would fucking amazing...Mary Lou O’Neil couldn’t even keep fuck away Ira funeral social distancing practiced all. FG got us pretty well IMO. Thank pointing out. I’m pretty surprised you’re first one. Bullshit. can't fix them. they're sick they'll infect others. think America would actually shovel people furnace someone could make enough money it. nation's entire ideology death cult. Yeah admit skim response. That’s bad. guess reading clouded other, shall say, less informed responses. Canada that's get kicked fine done repeatedly.  read NY Times profile Dasani? Sge pops mind while. [it's long read worthwhile ](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/invisible-child/index.html#/?chapt=0)

With new wave eviction looming, really scary too. western part country problem 10+ years running all-mail elections. guess could problem east northeast, widespread tolerance corruption indolence. dunno I'm slim. Either way crazy killer virus 99% population. better chance car crash. I'm going live fear. I'm going safe, people's sake, though. I'm anti mask anything, I'm quite left leaning. Careful, someone start arguing shock therapy way keep COVID-19 bay. link confirming this? favor see taking vaccine new time long term testing stupid dangerous.

Exactly. safe reasonably effective vaccine available 100% get it.
I trust Trump.  ^ This. Exactly this. I’d say 40% us unfortunately care... thanks Republicans That's I'm saying. Get practical, compromise get checks bank accounts. Since FDA apply it‘s rough german. Still pretty hefty though.

When operation eyes sign waiver. „1 5,000 excessive build blood eye-sockets, leading blindness“. three „1 5,000“ complications sign of. Ü Neat. Let's apply schools open tens millions students Universal wearing mask

Maybe? kids good this. kids parents literally told ""Do wear mask, Trump said no."" Also, little kids (understandably) struggle this. Maybe 50% chance Physical distancing

Classrooms size are, they're already overcrowded. original mandate 6 feet distance, revised everyone realized that's even possible, 3 feet. Still cases, going work. Let's call one Avoiding crowds

You mean like football games school hallways? one logistical nightmare best cases, schools already opened, working. 10% Outdoors “better” indoors

Not possible. schools ""sometimes outside"" classes, that's full-time thing, even possible many colder states. 5% success Washing hands

I doubt actually happening much want, feasible one list. Let's give Staying away bars”

Well, fortunately apply much students, cafeterias going nightmare. 50% best.

Putting together, I'd say schools probably going able/willing follow Fauci's advice maybe 30-40% time. suppose that's better nothing, option remote learning, makes sense. We're going willingly kill lot people schools year. I'm ready leave, countries hiring skilled labor?  think it’s kinda ironic Trump took wanted build wall keep people out, wall could used keep Americans in. weed dealers historically closed group like drug dealing, black market weed dealers already knew business ""on lock"" can't nowhere decide want set-up shop start selling weed expect one take notice drop clientele. live nice neighborhood steeping people's toes selling weed clientele area taking kindly. least people would inform/snitch/drop dime operation worst get set jacked goods. weed black market. anti-science people minority far small minority. made enough noise international attention problem overall image country.

At point going taken seriously? can, see typing ColoradoSun saying ""study"" university Denver like this, type ""BLM protests slowed pandemic"" first result. also seen article bigger outlet claiming that, either MSNBC something, remember.








The articles say things like BLM protests create spike pandemic ""everyone stayed home"" ""stay home tendencies increased"" . find lowkey scary, could mean peaceful protests first turned riots scared others.





I also saw thing France, normal protests Paris ended riots. end riots rioters attack soon see police, black women yelling black man policeman, someone yelling counter protesters they're ""dirty Jews"". 2 days. think parallel things happened France USA. deaths lower weekends? virus take time reported later? *being* reported? must half country make everything political

We elevate people's consciousness. First all, no, [~2.6% NYC tested 

Secondly, they’ve done seroprevalence studies city, likely ~20-30% city infected. 

Far “nearly everyone.” article doesn’t tell you, police gave man mask. threw mask ground refused wear it. arrested. Joesph Bryant’s charged since dropped.
Keep mind, he’s person who’s arrested. It’s homeless arrested, guess didn’t fit papers narrative. new zealand acted early enough strictly enough. new york absolutely waited way long take action. time cuomo issued stay home order, large numbers deaths pretty much baked in. nobody wore masks like april may. lot new york's response suboptimal say least. said, least action taken desired effect bringing numbers. contrast states like georgia florida reopened cases still rising yet level  Murica.....

Wanting argue got lucky disgusting, proves self centered apathetic person is. deep lockdown since March 11th. Massachusetts. 

The country hand mess. goes show you, really matters. first half, gonna lie. Personally, I'm terrified kids getting it, I'm also forced go work, can't afford daycare. They're young spend whole day alone. want go school, fuck else supposed do? blackmail......when repercussions worse Greitens?

Absolutely continue distance wear masks! There's lot reason worry health, especially kids, that's guarantee everything okay.

Personally, I'm back eating restaurants living life, family one two close friends, always wearing mask socially distancing others. Says who? God make mistakes.  remember Anthrax vaccine side effects, hence ""Gulf War Syndrome"" though could causes. Americans care... Depending part country in.

Northeast US? Yeah, enough people continue give shit, mostly reopened SAFELY keeping transmission rates low levels. see people Philly, NJ NYC walk around masks even they're going walks. Mask usage high here.

The South? Hahaha... rookie numbers. gotta pump up. Arkansans able cite concerns covid-19 excuse vote absentee ballot November elections, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced Thursday.

The governor, previously committed expanding use mail-in absentee ballots election, made announcement alongside chairs state’s Republican Democratic parties, well Secretary State John Thurston.

Thurston said last week believed law allow voters choose whether vote absentee pandemic, interpretation Hutchinson said concurred with. Yes, quite variable people affected. family member hopefully realizes everyone minimally affected him? 
Unfortunately, die can’t go around telling bad was! Nope give flying fuck. bars open, people camping, partying going dates. ALOT people wearing masks social distancing. mostly people early 20s 30s. I've seen people stores kids... masks, touching everything. asked woman needed mask kids... laughed walked away. americans trash. I'm ashamed country men. point probably deserve nuked.

Companies. know majority money make? Pay employees, buy goods/services employ companies employees.

The economy relies circle supply demand. Giving money directly Americans doesn’t help much naive Facebook news reading people think does. New Zealand : Joke You? Yeah kind question lot unknowns. People still getting sick, many them, someone is. county-level data find? Also, example South Korea 1 case per 1M population per day, they're still wearing masks. Population density high, though, vigilant. imagine Americans would act amount cases 1/160 times lower... wearing masks, that's sure (many people aren't, now). points high ticket prices, captive/livenation prices beer &amp; food, fucking fields!

I suspect people selling food pickups grease wagons group sex happens night People bashing US Brazil last checked.

The thing Sweden country think litterally let people die without anything. US hamstrung political fighting Brazil atleast got state goverments something. Sweden doesnt that. Sweden didnt shit. let people die. Srsly, going posts apocalyptic comments us quite exhausting. really work way. 

Yes does. like adjusting inflation buying power gain perspective dollar amount past. They're saying that, WW2 happened today, would directly proportional increase deaths function population. They're saying, terms social outrage defined deaths, we'd need hit 730,000 match WW2 deaths. Well gets likely every day Dear Europe,

Coming Michigander staying home away others, true Americans *do* care, large population idiots emboldened ""freedom"" want squawk  lot football programs don’t break even, either. power 5 make money. rest barely pay good year.

Which fine, college programs aren’t turn profit. Oh totally agree trying nice lol, it’s 100% someone super pedantic ignorant. Yeah India fucked Funny never see psychopaths complaining companies getting trillions .


But I'm suprised people find meaning sad life shitting poor people high horse licking thoses shiny boots. TLDR: Teachers part problem.

My friend teaching 10 years SC. 11th year. started new elementary school 50 teachers. Everyone negative C-19 test order attend first day. friend taken test received results back yet Friday 7/24 start Monday 27th. received results 3 afternoon, called HR. said sure would problem come Monday.

When arrived Monday morning discovered talking several teachers many gotten results yet. bothered her, social distancing everyone wearing masks. Two teachers tested positive training orientation.

They scheduled 2 days training COVID-19. 11 first day, two teachers still wearing masks faces. Even instructor removed mask. pattern continued rest week. Teachers would wear masks cars school, soon away doors, masks came off. comments started towards two masking teachers.

At first things like ""how breath wearing time?"" similar comments. became ""You're making rest us look bad."" pointed jokes started, course, end first week devolved name calling like ""sheeple"" ""snowflake"". teachers.

But point week made decide something lunch Wednesday. two masked teachers sat far corner cafeteria ate lunches home, socially distanced other, 45 teachers Principal engaged pot luck lunch, standing sitting shoulder shoulder eating other's dishes, many brought home. 

Monday went HR told two choices - put resign. resigned. Monday evening received first text unknown number. simply said ""snitches get stitches"". last week went on, received threatening texts, along things like ""we want teaching anyway"". seen texts eyes. attorney teaching tutoring online now, starting pay $30 per half hour - far teaching classroom buy supplies pocket students.

Bonus irony point: mask dispenser front school, filled 300 masks first day, empty end week. Teachers taking masks, refusing wear school.

If kids school age today, way I'd send kids back. reason You’re correct. Misremembered hastily re-read. I’ll edit now. Thanks! agreed much FL bashing much everyone else headline misleading.

The article covers data March May country shut states started reopen.

A telling stat would include June cases started increase, July cases exploded upwards. FL’s revenue still poorly, it’s even damaging loss DeSantis recklessly reopening state cost lives little show bending knee Trump. Things must getting first thought is, Trump stock company. Neurodivergent mentally ill two different terms. example autism learning disabilities part neurodivergent crowd mental illnesses since part someone go away without treatment. According National Symposium Neurodiversity (2011) held Syracuse University, neurodiversity is: ""...a concept neurological differences recognized respected human variation. differences include labeled Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Dyscalculia, Autistic Spectrum, Tourette Syndrome, others."" everything cool/popular US goes 

Starts fun, low, casual, hip, awesome, (the big one) ***actually affordable*** 

then bean counters suits take notice popular awesome affordable things say ""how take jack prices make awesome thing coporate safe, much boring, total fucking ripoff?"" 

and plot plan usually succeed. Keep drinking kool-aid, bro. LOL. always believe everything read? Specially count motorcycle deaths covid. *older* institutions get blindsided current reality, respond *classic* way. another sad example. necessary listen people tag line obviously demonstrably false? Sources say no, hand, sources say hell no. concerned went there. late now. everywhere. state mask mandate many businesses still limited. really. replied linked comment seems dont know lockdown is. hope so! say halfway know talking number people infected take another 5 months? I'm saying Trump effect decisions.  point EUA HDQ prove that. 

Let ask this, use EUA, rather traditional approval process, advise people take vaccine? read rest chain mean imply already know enemy is, definitely made clear. guess point majority people going pain, suffering, bad times, whatever want call right different degrees way people experience things extremely relative. understand coming though see comes tone def. think almost everyone hard time adjusting whatever changes forced best direct frustration right now. 

I totally agree seems like schools opening terrible idea right now. whole year complete shit show seem like sign getting better soon. bullshit. Muricans willpower it, sorely outnumbered.  there's new take. good one, though pretty critical fast, reliable tests tbh, tests better. thing virus ton people spread presymptomatic/asymptomatic. Imagine work hospital, prison, school. Anywhere constantly crowded, really.

In scenario 1, imagine test anyone. happens people get virus, get sick, others don't. Even ones get sick stay home, carriers continuing spread it. Exponential growth inevitable.

In scenario 2, test everyone daily. Now, catching many asymptomatic carriers early quarantine immediately stop spread despite feeling ill themselves. spread might still happen, lot slower transmission rate might able held 1, exponential growth occur.

Obviously, daily hard do, even weekly bi-weekly lot better nothing all. see people producing antibodies...
So actually think 100% chance body produce covid-19 catch it? XD

Did skip biology class highschool?

Also, studies shown people antibodies could loose ""immunity"" couple months.
While antibodies known diseases stay (often) system human body mechanical/computerized machine...
There many factors immune system learn combat foreign bodies body...

Please read scientists saying local/central politicians saying. pandemic politicized.
Democrats spreading false hope republicans flat lying...

Stay safe healthy.
Listen medical scientists saying politicians following. airborne governments want admit it? GP know epidemiology? Thoughts prayers universities happily plunge kids 20 years crushing debt. 66 he’s worried cooped “whole” life wtf There's nothing basic all. fucking darwinism. people born stupid anti-vaxx idiots....

&amp;#x200B;

Or else going explain USA randomly several orders magnitude kinds people countries per capita? think american genepool somehow tainted large amount stupid people according darwin die stupidity?

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe problem education, isolated hiveminds internet such?

Overall whole globe along rise internet seen massive rise kind delusional conspiracy individuals, seems counter intuitive right? internet free easily accessible information right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Well also place people find like minded indiviuals, join anti-vaxx facebook groups, suddenly community people believes conspiracy, groups encourage delusion suddenly people believe you. Compare internet, would go finding someone believe moon landing? Ask people bus? 99% would tell crazy, would stop believing it. Ok buddy. Death America! They’re babies point time, they’re clump cells could eventually become baby. really doubt this. Three tests total. First one rapid antigen test Trump team, positive. Second test regular PCR done later day, negative. Third test, another PCR done two days later, negative. 

His wife staff also tested negative. okay. understand whole subject deals emotion easy separate actual data analysis. economists determine life value live bliss. medic military, switch career paths. can't deal death case-by-case basis, shoot save everybody, going drive insane. gotta step back look bigger picture emotions get ya. India's clearly going overtake Brazil US pretty soon virtue massive population case retail workers too. sign clean covid soaked surfaces people can't sacrifice little stay home. strip clubs already gross enough without covid? Evangelicals definitely part general arbitrary anti establishment disdain schooling general led this. Welcome party Japan! countries counting vaccine then, right? open social distance practices place. crowds, limited capacity bars restaurants, etc... remain place vaccine developed, otherwise cases start going again. one's going back 'normal'.

So there's never vaccine? countries forever? 5+ years reach herd immunity? 

EDIT: rhetorical, btw, genuinely can't find answer questions, that's part point OP making here: lack communication leadership frustrating. starts feel like there's real goal people stop listening point. see. kind person.

Unless something absolutely outright said, must false. There's perspective, connecting dots. Absolutely act react one body shock great enough: Pearl Harbor; Kennedy shot; Challenger exploding; 9/11. 

This different happened much quickly, sudden / unexpected / nowhere (for vast majority us); helplessness prevent 😣

Another way look range responses ways cope realize every one us descended ancestors survivors pandemics. since started living larger groups, always epidemics later, pandemics.

We assume denial serves purpose. America sending best go strip club pandemic maybe deserve virus. combining home isolation suspect cases, home quarantine living household suspect cases, social distancing elderly others risk severe disease

Thats lockdown. estimated total deaths stricter controls, closed schools much lower.

The paper explicitly says this. stretch man. friend group thinks I’m insane “not life”. buddies jumped airplane Colorado party smoke weed (and complaining delta forced masks). local bar packed. local
National park seeing throngs people. Interstates tons state plates. Keep smart! *black athletes*. got one dimensional playing field head, huh? I'm less concerned side effects vaccine completely ineffective. Definitely latter. years I’ve soap box many people people don’t real hobbies days. Everyone goes home work consumes preferred media format. course it’s going get boring lockdown— already boring! Wait, mean tell democrats republicans swinging team whole time? don't, unlikely. Even common, forms Cancer less dangerous covid, vaccine still win. Wait, would getting car risky? Unless someone riding exposing anyone would sitting home. 

As long stay outdoors distanced matter travel. stay away people. saw idiot wild yesterday (rare live), dicknose (nose mask) 

Common live. This. lot both-side’ism doesn’t apply science media makes seem like it’s debate. 

Is climate change happening? Science 99.7% agreement news gives equal weight denialists. 

Same thing masks, vaccines, anything science related.  death count already 165,000. 1,000 deaths per day, somewhat slower weekends, 200,000 milestone reached mid- late-September. Yikes, would also wear googles work you. course, lieu finding ""safer"" work location favorable person:idiot ratio. lose 290k+ citizens even get fuck Nazis? worst deal ever. we're going wearing masks, social distancing, avoiding groups, what, forever? What's plan then? They’re going counting places though. It’s like regular mail going kinds different places. can’t compare regular mail. would think end all, death toll closer 1% population. That's based model epidemiologist ran novel sars/covid virus 2019. husband’s best friend lost dad week. 50s, preexisting conditions. Remember dems called Trump racist travel ban Nancy Pelosi told people go Chinatown act like normal? live Canada buddy, think know populations work hey keep telling whatever want. ROC used Torontos exaggerated self importance. We'll tolerate anything ourselves. someone looks us sideways, *U WOT M8?!* ..*putting students, university budgets, entire towns risk*

What *turn phrase*. 

Why could *safeguarding* towns, **STUDENTS**? kind trash headline this? Considering charge right now, agree them. Lock up!

/s wonder point sharing anything then, right? find new examples use tell ""other people"" idiots?

I suppose hope onto hope lot people stereotypically dug far right left curious news. hope me. lose 5% 70+ population Covid-19, fewer deaths 2022 fewer old people, point? US pandemic protocol follow created expanded Republican Democrat presidents.

Trump threw tantrum. 

Bet hey, virus largely killing senior/boomers. die, less likely really old congressmen keep getting elected.

This virus might needed finally purge rot. ok, then? Point? many fantasy bros crying right see. think people using give number perspective. Like, people die lightning strikes shark attacks.

Everyone scared sharks much lightning.

In case, everyone hates war (hopefully), taking Coronavirus seriously. 

So maybe analogy helps people, whose psychological defense minimize coronavirus death, understand many families impacts. flu vaccines guessing actual strain since made well advance flu season?

In case, know exactly we're vaccinating against. college football men’s basketball allows sports play all. way XC soccer breaks even, men’s women. 

And big sport schools public, following money easy read financial statements. 

Everyone salty agree completely.  Congress also gave money Trump wanted concentration camps borders.

That week biggest news headline Pelosi ripped paper. Best part task force see movie working fixing problem fired trump administration one first presidential actions 30 symptoms. look SK China, symptomless ratio symptomatic like 4-1 Note Europeans rest world. No. Americans don’t care, care themselves. Even people seems reasonable don’t care. camp included sleeping together, singing cheering. also know initial COVID-19 incidence spreading vectors (Staff Children). Therefore report referring too, though interesting, enough prove R children school age school environment 1. Excess deaths indeed give us fuller picture numbers available. curious current count 200,000 from. seen excess deaths data yet. thought we'd wait end year see 2020 statistics.  delivered time shipping other, closer, allies rearming conflict east.

OP either shitty history teachers historical revisionism. Yeah, let know find anything. Maybe us two dollars hour taken us middle get help well. much appreciate work scientist, number BS. either F'n idea they're simply want tell public. take genius figure even 295k figure seems low, given thing going far Still republicans. whatever, ads far superior anything democrats putting out. treatments “way out”. 

Vaccines help build herd immunity effective enough people take (two huge ifs there) treatment turns COVID common cold people game changer. called way many times since March, constantly late, finally let go. little bit money, afford it. know everyone that. fuck it, I'm vacation. Think might go camping while. somehow entire global generation turned malignant narcissists stopped maturing emotionally 6. thing pandemic brought tendency whine ""but that's FUN! can't tell do!"" whatever feel like anyway. stay house months horrible disease die out? ""noooooo parties beach vacations bars restaurants that's fuuuuuuunnnnnn~"" remember one pissed early days pandemic people getting reddit twitter tiktok going ""look, social-distancing block party!"" PARTIES fucking difficult people. look are. would whole thing wiped everyone stayed fuck home narcissists ruined rest us. Haha. Happy oblige.  Plenty people care, they've sacrificing jobs mental health MONTHS get thing control. many others just... give shit. somehow think hoax. someone falls first group, can't even fathom hateful, ignorant, brainwashed second group must be. people like extended family. can't respect childish selfish they've behaved whole mess. Bullshit. Provide solid credible source. work hospital. I’ve yet see anything like that. 

Edited add: 

Quit spreading fucking lies. least they've got less cases world Well, CDC reporting 200,000 excess deaths 2020. Pretty sure lot higher 1% government regulator similar risk metrics. FDA conservative end Western medical regulatory agencies (which always good). treatments get Europe Japan US FDA over-reaction things like Thalidomide. media doesn’t talk much. It’s normalized. stories covering google news fashion masks stuff vaccines. Fewer number updates warnings. Lol. No. ones open great business. - Masks, lack thereof

- Absence testing February March

- Gyms bars opening soon

- Alternate facts

MAGA! funny, thing good orange twat presidency gringos insecure, dumb outspoken time. record world thinks Europe cool responsible brother guys sort inbred cousin. Sorry single scariest thing Trump done. Mail slowing many states don’t accept ballots Election Day. friend mailed card took 3 weeks get across Colorado, got yesterday. used take day. 

People need try best either mail soon receive it, find local ballot box drop themselves. 

Slowing postal service one things Trump could prevent mail voting seems like he’s best make happen.

I know he’s done lot horrible shit, dictator move freaks out. Europeans afraid criticizing America America protects Russia. 

Russia cartoon villain. Russia wants buffer want surrounded NATO. Russia interest invading France. believe European countries are, based what? 330 million-ish people. us staying home, wearing masks go get groceries, staying six feet away anybody....well exciting news. current situation shows though. man's death anything thousands people died already prove. We've already data necessary show opening schools would bad idea. never work. look adults guys raised children No, don’t. say Me: Cites article law professor detailing limitations federal law handling national quarantine.

You: We're done tolerating BS.

::eye roll:: Anyone taking bets long lasts? least NYC? surrounding states starting flare again, unless there's total shutdown interstate travel kiddos arent sent back school I'm betting get 4 months we're right back there.

Upstate fine though. pretty sparse there. ba-dum-tss! ;) wait couple weeks see people start developing ass teeth.

r/oddlyspecific

Edit - lol Step 1- Reopen

Step 2- ???

Step 3- ???  That's exactly said, multiple press outlets twisted words pretzel make ""bad news"". failed note multiple widely used vaccines single dose highly effective like MMR HPV Numbers lie....only .03% die virus. Let's see Europe doing....UK .15% die.....France .15% die....Germany 0.4% die....Italy .14% die...seems USA better job Europe...go figure. math yourself...just look COVID19 deaths getting virus. Easy math.  Yes, virus kills mega idiots world needs That's democracy works. vote still count. decisions made.

Any case, difference 3 138 ? absolutely cut number majority minority. 

Seeing bubble hard. Plenty us care, care deeply; problem many others goddamn selfish think anyone themselves, anything want, right now, screw everyone else. I'm going grit teeth wish every single one dead, admit wishing they, alone--not innocent people end infecting--get sick enough realize (1) no, hoax, actual virus disease still know little about, know enough know bad; (2) people pushing masks distancing impose socialism take away precious ""freedum"", we're still decent enough human beings try help get sick (God knows us; made plain word deed); (3) we're together, need work together order hope slowing virus point something vaguely resembling ""normal"" life resume. Given people behaved exact ways 1918-19 flu pandemic, however, lot hope us right now.

(Any reasonably smart, funny, decent-looking straight men Canada Ireland looking modern equivalent war bride, like women late middle age? aromantic/asexual women countries looking good roommate? Must like cats chocolate; work rest it. I'm partly joking here...) well deserved. Like 65ish percent us care, astounding number sure. anti-intellectual men, psuedo-science stay-at-home uneducated moms, conspiracy theorists stupid frat/sorority college kids fucking give fuck.

A part starting become jaded want get suffer die. We're better without them.  Yes am. Fuck idiots... forced renounce right medical treatment since believe it’s flu there’s need worry it.... American. blaming Republicans. Republicans blame Democratics. blaming someone else pass responsibility something it.

In Europe, Karens rednecks mindset. bunch Karens rednecks. think I’m permanently dehydrated point. love Bowie first thing do: stop buying stuff made china. Otherwise bankrolling crimes. need something made China US company makes buy used eBay. ask friends one use. Blink blink

I Belgian citizenship kid given 30 years ago 13. Think Belgium would reinstate asked nicely? US astonished massive increase rape cases involving young girls 20 year old immigrants never end justice

""don't care"" Sex, drugs, booze student housing. know dumb lol. think thing make sure vote right people. Right people.  Unsurprised still sad. us actually care doesn’t matter. Caring helps everyone it. dread numbers Fall.

And people returning communities. 

Sad know. Canada. obvious happens, right? numbers work fundamentalists' end times scenario. Uh there’s plenty evidence false reportings. It’s money, government pays hospitals every Covid death. thing care 1% getting returns stock market, means forcing minimum wage workers work pandemic without taking precautions. No, not. press accounts extraordinarily poor. said minimum bar 50% approve. said expect 98% effectiveness single dose, initial flight vaccines. ""Highly effective"" 98% vaccine development. MMR, example considered highly effective 93% Mumps.

So, multiple jabs, bad public health POV (people go back second jab) makes Fauci unhappy. family Florida rsvp'd come wedding Illinois. Yeahhh, I'll pass irrelevant conversation. Death rate function medical treatment well underlying conditions. means NY poor job treatment makes sense given knew lot less proper equipment readiness handle it. 

But conversation infection rates driven something starts treatment phase death rate really different topic. Quebec? worse Sweden lower population harsher measures. go vomit insanity them. I'm sure appreciate much do.  Ah, yeah, those. Okay, there's communication breakdown here. understand they're sometimes referred military, that's incorrect nomenclature. military region's organization gets called upon times war combat. They're really military people understand military. states defense forces that, even they're dressed similar attire. No, rebelled businesses losing monopoly, would lead fair competition reduction prices. 

Then rich business owners convinced public would paying taxes (instead less, truth) well... are. 

Started corporations manipulation population profit. mess proud tradition continued. That’s pretty much rest world it’s amount substantially larger US. 250k went sturgis rally last week! That’s potentially 250k infected taking back home homes around US. disaster. even allowed happen beyond me?! Thats WW2, WW1 every army run gunfire capture trench, stupid idea. japanese didnt learn 1st war would charge american soldiers would rip shreds. Organic good things respect animal welfare quality. want certification system keeps evidence-based good things leaves pandering anti-science, new age hippies bullshit out. No, care.

I'm still arguing people masks even work (yes work, nothing change mind 100% effective pointless). Yup. Even seems pretty unlikely. generally blamed specific adjuvant, adjuvant used vaccines see increases narcolepsy. researchers believe may caused combination already infected, receiving vaccine, that's clear cut either. also possible lot increased diagnoses due large media response initial findings. Typically, chronic fatigue takes average 3 years onset symptoms diagnosis. everyone country talking it, increase likelihood diagnosed. really know sure happened. case mortality rate 3.2%

Go tell Johns Hopkins they’re good bye. sad guys leave us take others wirh you, weak Wearing mask party bar wont help. private school Michigan never soap bathrooms. don’t know world they’re going keep us safe world doesn’t recognize sovereign country China want to. China considers Taiwan part China. Chinese revolution took place, ruling class/intellectuals escaped Taiwan tried start country. kidding me? think MSM one siding side Trump's? There's first time conspiracy theory. Oh please. COVID-19 deaths faked? wish people would cut shit out. It’s misinformation ridiculous. I'm aware of. Total case count entire state fluctuating 200 700 cases day months now. must shaking rage. sorry. it’s Portland see talking science COVID attack Trump.

Well done fucking job Crazy “Christian way” means I’ll want fuck everyone else’s safety. Another way screw poors. crazy Americans ( russian accent) Kick level analysis. 

I think real problem money. 

Taxes low, rich people profitable businesses. long term result 50+ years generation three people get rich inherit wealth things either bad society, take skill education. one thing actor athlete get rich, even without college education. That's hard work. consider Paris Hilton even Donald Trump. Inherently fraudulent ignorant people. get rich and/or powerful purely parents semi competent (but totally crooked) businessmen. 

I think Buffett said going give money away, bequeath children enough money ""they anything, nothing.""

This problem. much money power hands people literally nothing add value society. Negative value, probably. profitably them.

In context, actually feels sadly rational roughly half adult voting age people country give opt out. vote. 

What's point? system broken, matter hard work much kids study, they're never going rich. frankly, many folks, they're never going able simply stop working. Ever. day die. Never able afford buy house. Investments. Start company. Buy new (new-new) car. Go dream vacation. Fancy clothes. Season tickets favorite team. Whatever supposed motivate us notionally-capitalist (but actually class-driven, money-driven) system get ahead, work hard, study well, raise kids better life parents had.

I mean personal life see vestigial American Dream still true subset (minority) Americans. often mostly working class immigrants warzones shithole countries, literally anything better that. still offer that, least: anything. Something, else. 

But do, growing failed family farm? Working dying coal town WV? defunct factory town rust belt? Fishing codfish gone? do? 

For 50-100M Americans, despair. rage. get drunk, high escape. 200M+ Americans walks life, races ethnicities, urban, rural, north, south, precisely one thing still common: 

Debt. 

Before COVID, 40% America less $500 total net worth. cash bank. Net worth. Think that. greatest unemployment crisis century. what? really shitty excuse fucking suck. guess agree can, mathematically coexist. practicality actuality. get wealth content stop. dont believe real even, ""m'uh right's"" Simon bridges. Gotcha. That’s thinking, wanted make sure. I’m glad recovered shit though. Ah, better way put it. 'bout using word historically extremely hurtful population. think, ""if act selfishly"" better descriptor. Awful lot inconsistencies arrogance. agree you. feel like you’re risk dying it, one taking precautions catch it, rather rest us changing everything them.
And, we’re going get downvoted this, mostly majority Reddit’s population 15 year olds social distancing years COVID  Also American, I'm embarrassed us. understand! Truman going drop atomic bombs Japan!  wish more, elected people rather take country them. Exactly Halfway Diamond Playbutton Idk Americans keep convincing others anti-intellectuals minority, Trump ""an accident"". 

Because easier so. We've also generally speaking got high opinion ourselves, regardless reality actually is, something applies even liberals. outright reject anything goes beliefs. know, wait month, highly prioritized get vaccine unless high risk? full-grown adults punching retail workers asking wear mask. doubt even get teenagers wear them. No, shut up! America bad!!! People suck, they're easier kill fetuses. problem? Sad Pacific, African, Italy noises was/am abdominal pain. Went hospital yesterday. Urinalysis, ECG, Blood work, ultrasounds done. cost? 5 dollars parking. Um... Okay, Cleopatra queen denial. Portland? Seattle? Chicago? ""God, guns, grits"" folk? Looks opposite. ""Satan, laser pointers/steel pipe/fireworks/Molotov, quinoa"" folk. Burning cities tripping ecstasy. mean... Covid Kim Reaper says no. 

She never wanted close schools bars telling people fine stay open less 24 hours closed then. Mask usage Des Moines pretty high however 95 99 counties fairly rural mask usage 20% assure you. Japan ally US, lot Japanese people adopt American ideals. People China would never emulate American stupidity. response intended dark joke rather serious question... know... Americans oppose universal health care died. Mist places bars closed moot point. see japanese drinking US kool aid... problem lots people deserve this. got roped situation NA government beyond corrupt. hard imagine frustrating must live America reason. media refuses acknowledge government legitimate. It’s fucking set backs That's funny. moved Wimberley NYC. masks Wimberley. People bragging finding grocery stores require masks, hoax, bill gates conspiracy, etc. Stay safe!  That's like saying proud shooting n face. get praise avoiding obviously dangerous situation. accessible be. Unemployment offices notoriously hard reach process arduous tree full haha. still producing come tree. Yesterday 30lbs. Jam j got down, parents owned jam company Context : one disagreeing Fauci others saying masks needed general population, fine call. Quit making things up.


In fact, many medical professionals stating, untrained people using masks could dangerous. that's training they've received years.

Must meet certain standard, touch mask face scrubbing in. context, that's medical professionals shoulder shoulder operating room physically touching patient table front them. Joe six-pack bar shooting pool playing darts, Karen hanging drinking Frappachinos friends.



Context: 300 million people staying home minimum 6ft away others need medical grade masks.


They still don't. People properly trained many act like mask alone makes invincible, every little flaw makes mask useless.


Context: Medical professionals physically touching patients enclosed rooms, shoulder shoulder medical professionals do.


Context: N95 masks short supply still are.


Context: FDA eventually approved certain medical masks U.S. medical professionals N95, met standards, like Europe Japan


Context: doctor scientist right mind going recommend anything far know untested potentially dangerous. approved masks time U.S. needed medical professionals.


Context: Fauci sitting wife close friend. 

Context: Faucis water bottle knees.





In 2020 everyone video cameras pockets, game filmed live TV, huge focus Fauci there...  


Do proof lasted longer couple minutes?

Do proof 3 masks time?

Do proof three complete strangers?



You come across irrational vendetta Fauci.


Are Anti-mask upset Fauci pushing now?


Are Pro-Mask think Fauci caused millions Americans rush hoarded masks medical professionals enough of, staying home effective living like normal mask?


Do think Fauci recommend masks never studied approval U.S., knowing would possibly lesser quality N95 added risk regular people things medical professionals trained risk. Touching braces, masks, etc...? got trouble wearing one pants leg rolled like Cool J!! also we're going count way, might well count excess deaths covid column flimsy square fabric would save us this! Maybe look US right 3.2% 

This “case fatality.” statistics would call tested population sample population. survey example, can’t take answers say “WHAT PEOPLE DIDNT SURVEY?” go test run appropriate formulas. You’re person I’ve seen run around spewing IFR nonsense. I’ve seen listed anywhere reputable sources you’ve posted nearly everywhere else running case fatality. 

There chance could never know, never get tested never die. don’t know percentage is. know, certainty, test positive, 3.2% people died. It’s hard understand.   think science could provide proof want people would still go gut feeling YouTube video. Anecdotes emotions evidence. 

Complications vaccine? 40-50 years ago? due lack funding resources? safety measures technology changed it’s made? vaccine bad outcomes harder easier produce one?

By standpoint people must question every detail daily lives. wiring house safe? food you’re eating actually made ingredients bag? actually pumping gasoline vehicle? know few.online defend Boeing work bestest company ever. flu vaccine even get flu prevents getting badly/dying it. covid vaccine same? doesn’t work well overweight people mean people healthy weight? mean doesn’t work become super spreaders? Putting healthy Americans danger? masklesness good proxy stupidity, USA wouldn’t anywhere close stupid place.  got lot good time men North America look Justina Trudeau. need get creative make new releases streamable like 5 bucks movie something.

My idea best definitely way make work someone gets paid bug bucks able implement. guy positive rhetoric vaccines one day negative next. Well... wasn’t Bugs Bunny. Bugs Bunny &amp; Taz wearing long, loose sports jersies, backwards hats, crossed arms! SCANDALOUS! Look Tuskegee experiments thought also. seems mostly theatrics point. Virus rampant community + school open = every kid going get it. even bother testing isolating? weeks school cases going explode anyway.

I similar thoughts seeing news article every time kid gets sick. course someone got sick Notre Dame University. knew kids would get sick, that's entire dorm dedicated sick kids. need see article everytime happens. I'm complaining news coverage, per se, surprised people get surprised. prevent impact changing building codes change build, build areas easily flood. Something like 60% Americans never leave home state.
You start realize related. sucks people dying, country 400+ million barely drop bucket. shit... Americans would wasn’t culturally enforced young age don’t six figure white collar job you’re scumbag peasant.

We giving poor Americans jobs give living wages them, good working conditions, instead worrying foreigners. grocery store 1% events still go to. would really unlucky could catch covid and/or flu. sister told driving four hours baby shower. I'm like, wrong you? going travel longer distance, probably stop couple times way, go gathering matter small people? hope outdoors counting it.  big show put hygiene theater cheaper employing actually effective methods would clean air. it’s $$$ people charge, apparently. 🙄🤬 apology people charge failing right thing.

I think lot people charge look argument 2 sides, especially now. creates sort bias feel need compromise. ""We'll open wear masks, etc."" see lot situations can't bias without something bad happening. sad 1) they'll punished right thing 2) can't find way right thing. tl;dr: “The trend due part younger people falling sick, well better control disease’s spread high-risk settings, nursing homes. doctors say there’s another factor pushing survival rates: better treatments.”

Right, China, Italy, NYC, NJ, didn’t know much things like putting many folks ventilators; proning patients; fast crash; related issues cause death initial CoV infection; etc., etc., etc. wish they’d stop calling response. order classified response, form action required. baffling *lack response* truer description. (in mind quite well-done) Italian study looked probability symptoms based index cases contact tracing cases. one quarter males 80 progressed critical disease course. females roughly 15 %.

I think national policy, people affected help national policy someone screwed lower-level decision making. 

I think Swedish figures overstate actual disease severity elderly. malice, testing back still limited also see need concentrate testing severe cases capacities there.

What astonishes disease : I've seen polymorbic HD-dependant elderly patients almost 0 symptoms also saw young healthy people weeks-long ICU/IMC treatment. 

We still know far virus. cannot wait go school next week! anxious all! Dems flip say ""see, can't republicans offer this"", vote happen. ""slight"" mutation bit misleading. share something like 98% DNA chimps, one say difference humans chimps essentially ""slight"" mutations. Saying COVID-19 ""could well like that"" also misleading, since suggests higher likelihood projected. right indications far suggest COVID-19 evolve rate. We've got 8 months evidence virus, detected types mutations could dramatically change virus. contrast, know flu mutate time scale. Source China's disinformation campaign obviously lockdown Italy did. think hit upon lockdown idea themselves, claiming China's lockdown violated human rights? so, send volunteers US pool party. fun meanwhile get test need done. parents fight better working conditions stimulus checks instead sending kids shooting range? case thinking saints, case thinking used masks usually obey rules set government way higher rate Europe especially US population. 1 death yesterday certainly country spiraling control. fining parents sending sick kid school. Dont expert know process usually takes years done fraction time might safest. Dont think extremist stance either. look Trump. Old obese fear Chyna flu. responsibility save countries expense US taxpayer dollars. countries pay fucking problems. Report updated, 23 now. expected. Infection lags contact, testing lags infection, reporting lags test results. See Twitter photos mean India Africa US citizens care. severely mentally challenged minority loud. I’m trying make statement essential workers need something wether it’s hazard pay even small bonus. Yes get paycheck still people sitting home getting extra $400 month $600 without essential workers we’d screwed Oh, see. Thanks clarifying distinction. live California ex’s mother would work IEPs home a...middle school teacher? zero experiential knowledge saw heard perspective (and one friend high school teacher many years ago).

Vaccines easy get politics tries make people believe. Yea leftists board dont like facts like this. That’s things don’t get controversial something done it. Serious question. Isn’t week early confirmed cases? Couldn’t gotten virus somewhere else? Sorry sounds dumb.

I try keep everything going also don’t like keep much feel like it’s much times. Jeez, never failed hard something im bottom 0.15% 

Got going incident

If going guess, greater likelihood would extra cases Guillain-Barre Syndrome screwed up, since COVID linked that. sort rare autoimmune fuckery like rushed vaccine surprising. elders dying enough them, want kids die too. life anymore? Reddit hate 😠 emojis, use 🧰 well avoid scrutiny 🧐🔬

👍 &lt;Shocked Pikachu wish someone predicted sending kids back school would dangerous knew?/s

And shhhh. tell see! conspiracy theorists wack Four finger strap rule? choose die. living like decades. enjoyable I'm fun. exactly foolish demand United States goes back full lockdown. virus stay. Anytime lockdown, virus spike lockdown ends, means essentially destroying economy good reason. Oh I'm wrong, seems dont like science. Keep attending Dr Lemons lectures, seems speed No, reinfection. rather new strain. still correct refer second wave, incorrect call reinfection. Name one airborne virus death rate like you’re hoping for. even close. No, doesn’t exist did, yes would absolutely wiped civilization loosing education time? pffft. like able learn 5th grade english 6th. Let us worry quality.

Ever wonder smarter 5th grader? taught mind filling crap useful real life. Teach kids learn, find subjects fascinate them, love nurtured... stopping it.

Just opinion old mom.  found simply beautiful. paranoid? saying Soros insinuating im paranoid

Honest question, coincidence people anti mask protests time. humans globally enough covid it.  argue related population - reminder - Toronto, Ontario North America's 3rd largest city population less 1/10th infection rate per capita. Yeah right..let's send kids school see happens...throw dice..wtf
#tRUMP : is.... there's got people like every country, matters quantity. dozen people city 40 million, nothing, matter. nearly half population like that... have... America's covid-19 response I’m Massachusetts. pretty good considering there’s absolutely guidance federal government. Fuck Trump. wear “personal protective equipment” working prevent spread infection might Sick people. also wear “personal protective equipment” entering room person infectious. currently going Thru pandemic, resulted people attempting spread become infected. see people wearing masks market remember parents used tell believe everything read internet...

HA... hahahahahahahaha Got word friend’s university emergency meeting week semester begins.

Apparently 20+ Student Athletes tested positive, they’re reconsidering opening campus. Please - show us data regarding causes initial spread. far I’ve seen echoes Swedish authorities anecdotally claiming combination bad luck Stockholm connected world Copenhagen. 

From March 11-18 Sweden Denmark’s death counts followed exactly. 18th Sweden started pick speed. 

3 weeks average time takes die Covid 19. Average. die less two weeks. 

March 3rd Denmark ordered travelers northern Italy self quarantine 14 days. Sweden not. 

March 8th Denmark banned large gatherings public events. Sweden not. Instead 30.000 people gathered inside Globen Stockholm Eurovision finals. 

Could please see evidence differences effect happened two weeks later on. 

Also seem repeating claim reason Sweden’s curve gone much slowly Denmark’s entirely blame bigger initial spread nothing harder measures Denmark. 

Would lovely see proper data supporting bold claim. Thank you, thought so. read like 12 years ago, need again. Oh wow! 42 Kids died! people freak out?!? that's quarantine! bet kids even going revive let school! advice Doctor Australia. flu shot isn’t 100% I’ve never negative effects not, also haven’t ever flu since taking swear old women little girls school. Nobody ever balls tell athlete ass needed change clothes (fyi spiky goth kid). double standard stupid. Well tried eliminate back 40s! Well, fair, report states people tested positive—it doesn’t say anything symptoms. So, tested positive may asymptomatic. Would interesting know symptoms observed, any. Ban people national chains life. people never felt consequence shitty behavior. wonder many deaths preventable vaccines would really hesitate would 1) live-virus vaccine, 2) vaccine either Russia China. that, probably take vaccine becomes available. US 50x covid deaths per capita do.

These numbers insane  someone say flu me. could nod. World War Z, great read. 1) That's journalism works. That's cheerleading works. assure majority America likely world look happened Seattle Chaz/Chop happening Portland disgust. 



2) percent land area hundred people article take up? data got transferred HHS added 3 day lag period data least far tell. Right, forgot. Australia also south equator you’d going winter also right now. New Zealand too. That's still case Germany, fully reopened schools Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Sturgis 10 days, 4-5 day (median) incubation period, participants symptoms end rally. interesting. Stupid gets votes for. shame, good people suffer Nothing soothes throat like nice cup polonium tea ☢️ 🍵 problem someone mean China， make Chinese people government (most time both) think actor director friendly， movie guy make boycott， ban movie attack Chinese。 Well idea. immune response phase 1 phase 2 trials either mimic response people actual virus shown stronger response people actual virus. trying see effective response preventing COVID-19. get outside 200k range really failed beyond belief important bulletproof vest Surprised pikachu Title says Victoria technically it’s 6M people.

We’re number 1!!! probably best summary whole situation ever read least amount words possible., happened good ol shoes? #Shocked_Pikachu.jpeg typed many responses this. feel like accurate response point shit. go outside raining gonna get wet.


You open schools pandemic, guessed it... True. Fixed. begins. Omg, ridiculous 😂 think underestimate level isolation people doing. last week went see mom,I left house since mid March. Every delivery sanitized came socialized physically outside bf lives same. said, I've relaxed little lately look forward much needed distant socializing future. 

Still, want leave potentially expose shot. right things flaring more. collective “we” doesn’t really apply anymore US.

Never did. ICU capacity never risk Sweden, morbid choice:

“The ICU wards comparatively empty,” said Dr Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér, Karolinska University Hospital. “Elderly people taken hospitals—they given sedatives oxygen basic care.”

Yngve Gustafsson, geriatrics specialist Umea University, told BMJ proportion older people respiratory care nationally lower time year before, even though people 70 worst affected Covid-19. He, too, aghast practice doctors prescribing “palliative cocktail” sick older people care homes telephone.

“Older people routinely given morphine midazolam, respiratory-inhibiting,” told Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, “It’s active euthanasia, say *surprised pikachuface* send daughter it. Imagine 3rd grade. kids wearing masks day teacher freakinh dies, kids parents die, fucking die, etc... reopening schools stupidest fucking decision local hillbillies around demanding it.

I homeschooled last year since work home school blatantly teaching religious crap kids, allowing kids bully since everyone knows everyone (small town), generally nightmare. - said, going send back public school year since she'd going new school want miss social life comes public school.... I'm going pump breaks that. We're insane experiment. Wow 5 to1 that's nice. like 15 20 1 I'm sure crazier areas. Unless live small town. 
If 5 1 might ok it. I’m one taking vaccine immediately. Shocking I’m anti masker, virus denier believe science. however mistrust government, don’t fool. leading vaccine candidates using new science yet used humans. vaccines brought market record speed good reason. attempting make vaccine roughly 10% normal time using new technology. Also interesting vaccine producing companies liability injury death result product. Combine governments rush waive(the USA) liability corporations event spread. cause mistrust. 3 dollar price tag (probably) poor countries. UK every school uniform 16. thought 👍🏼 COVID: America’s Sweetheart Virus got fired purpose could collect unemployment fuck place worked. masks, loud fuck get right someone speak...

Have good time Covid-19. Whoo, 5 million, guys! Next stop, stretch goal 10 Million!

Wait.. No-  saw Dallas back day opening act U2.

Great show. Israeli here, America. went 5 cases day 1st wave 2000+ day bullshit.

I understand actual fuck wrong people there's something could potentially send straight onto fucking ventilator need protect *wear damn cloth face outside*, fucking hard that? embarrassing must student school shamed national medias Let eat covid. would bet $ get vaccine vials full saline right election. won’t know fake mid November. entire argument coming appeal authority. That's it, trust officials this. 

Normally, would agree. get flu vaccine every year think anybody get children (or even pets) vaccines ignorant dangerous. 

But different. Many us trust current administration, especially president needs vaccine announcement chance reelection. plenty reasons this, EAU hydroxychloriquine, shady stuff posted CDC website death rates, early lies masks, fact president lies time constantly puts undue pressure top officials even calls names constantly public defy him, etc. stuff happen normal administration, truly scary comes trusting administration's health advice. 

So since entire argument comes ""I trust officials"", big problem convincing many people. Yes :). I’m glad son found career works lucrative right now’!

I think especially boys education system wired succeed hands shy etc. saw time school taught especially middle school don’t mature fast. Indeed. However, FDA approves vaccine, trust FDA would make right choice. experts. know what’s right. almost children human too! Quick, someone tell Fox.  know percent long term health effects? Wouldn’t take years know that? WE'RE NUMBER 1! WE'RE NUMBER 1! Well, depends. start think may chinese operation spreading narrative alternative media. strangely enough always countries problems chine, bigger issue, bigger anti mask propaganda media. hope stupid idea actual reality. ""...mostly... depending..."" talking America, considering many deaths we've America shows definitely pace hit 500,000+ deaths 2 year period.

World wide think going significantly lower, considering level medical technology, would embarrassing people died pandemic 100 years ago War? It’s party time Brazil. Millions believe virus hoax people dying COVID.  leave kids home get supplies curbside. kids 10 wear mask- mean get go spread unmasked aerosols around store workers wanted see toy aisle. Isn’t White House burning hundreds thousands tests day results within hours?

That sounds like fear me. government state governments walk fine line point. lot possible mediation actions backfire resisted against, starting armed resistance one possible outcome. hand, top-down efforts would help chip away R0 value -- 1) ramp contact tracing efforts immediately, 2) ramp testing, 3) ramp treatment quarantining sick people actually get better (I believe ignored personal honor system large part spread), 4) improve consistent messaging explains what's going on, talks statistics, strategy is, 5) provide free regular allotment PPE people (masks, sanitizer, etc). Unfortunately, think none implemented unless Biden elected put office. I’m anti-vax, there’s way injecting anything rushed market administration. Noice

Every life lost preventable sicknesses devastate surviving family life. young victim, parents regret every possible choice got kid sick gone.

Russia could blitzkrieged Ukraine, instead used covert means: special forces, “little green men,” proxy militias mercenaries—all waging disinformation campaign. Kremlin’s “kill 'em confusion” strategy worked. time international community figured out, Russia's conquest Crimea fait accompli. Moreover West rally world defend Ukraine basic facts question? can’t. **War becoming epistemological: telling real fake decide winners strategists view war like old-fashion lightbulb: either off. wrong, cunning adversaries like China exploit space war peace victory.** trick keeping American war switch flipped “off” remains docile “peace.” example, Beijing goes right edge war—or America thinks war—in South China Sea stops, keeps captures creates. engage “lawfare” bends—or rewrites—the rules international order China's favour. rule law, rather subversion. also bought much Hollywood, making impossible cast China villain movies—a brilliant strategic move international court public opinion.

P.S. best documentary subject, even little dry. Haha. ninja. shed blood mean land belongs them.

In fact, I'd say Russia broken several countries. grown large holds much power region. 

Same goes china, lesser extent, India. Kinda same, GF wants get 3 wheeler ( classic am. bad back that) regular cycle. look nice but... It’s back normal testing four days already. Last four days 85k-104k tests. 3 day testing dip 2nd-4th it. excess mortality 2020 far ~200,000 US. Meaning number deaths expected July modeling surpassed 200,000 due Covid. 

For every false positive saying there, 2 deaths attributed covid maybe be. American even top 5 infections/capita

Pick one downvoted stating simplest fact? mortality rate COVID-19 0.5 %, 1-2 %. think India fudge numbers, they'd top. Still drop [massive wasted human lifes. I’m teacher won’t coming back work situation controlled. far able work home.
There’s speculation resuming face face classes. decide resume it’s clearly inappropriate, I’ll quit.    Best solution mandate everyone gets vaccine. Since know much shit storm bring anti-vaxxers, whoever else. shouldn’t mandate it, require someone go back work, required show proof. going restaurants/businesses. 

I feel people would much likely get vaccine realize alternative job going businesses like normal. mom Corpus Christi, yesterday went huge rant children childhoods torn wear masks school. pointed wearing mask 1000x better dying sick go PICU life support (I work PICU Phoenix Children's hospital AZ, could say know I'm talking about), entire family jumped throat protect kids pedophiles country. frustrating conservative parents give shit science shows. show article nah? wait ....kids can't get virus.....

Romeo Juliet endanger lives health care workers. steps skipped? can't claiming answer question? What's pointless conjecture vaccine released tomorrow clearly happening? care much potential long term complications pandemic itself?

There plenty reasons vaccine development usually takes long time. Money, bureaucracy, lack take risk failure turning large enough profit. unprecedented scope disease changed that. Billions dollars invested. Government helping streamline process, skip steps. Companies normally cautious R&amp;D programs willing take immense risks produce effective SAFE vaccine. conceivable benefit could company government gain rushing dangerous, ineffective unstudied vaccine public?

It's weird see people scientists, doctors public health experts act like wait month make opinion safety vaccines phase II/III trials run actual experts take longer that... do

[I'm good portion vulnerable people already died. bad news we're eventually vulnerable way. term vague me. anyone personally feels disconnected majority neurodiverse? fuzzy line drawn? Public bathroom toilets typically lids. I'm seeing phase 5, 4 testing subjects condition?  Yes been. done proper planning. time start getting back normal country. Yeah many deaths excessive reporting deaths. Less reporting = less deaths. Merica still number 1 ask me. logic applies though

You're covering speaking new hospitalizations covid patients? good news don’t need everyone get it. vaccinate 50 comorbidity crowd covid become clinically insignificant. 10 dead children artical covers matter you? least family calling hoax saying George soros Bill gates faked whole thing *405,399 1200+ americans Technically want bump based population changes, administration keeps doing, we'll blow past it. idea honest comparison less supporters dismiss it. Good point, though would think mask would probably help extent (as long hanging around bathroom long). ""It is."" -President Trump is, knowing that, residents town still supported cancellation. TBH mostly blame insane governor, essentially forced inaction. posted trusted people South Dakota make decisions, ignoring one actually made. current administration completely threw window adopted a, ""don't worry bro, like flu"" approach

Quite literally without even analogy: watching moistly. That's sad part this. people little regard, event literally find necessary endanger entire country little fun. Absolutely pathetic. worries, look forward updated data. Either way definitely see university enough testing. 330 embarrassing population 21k students staff. stages grief happen societal scale? Big true  many parts country people following instructions. common knowledge dude.
 
Not extent smoothbrains sub think. people don’t wear mask, far between. It’s easier point finger instead accepting fact virus long time though. There's much room error handwashing though, sterile. wrong, forgetting use paper towel turn handles, paper towel, what?

Personal preference. confident wash hands truly sterile way, it, best option. Otherwise, I'd probably skip use hand sanitizer outside (because careful touch anything bathroom begin with). I'm super paranoid though, honest, I'd probably bring bottle water portable soap roadtrip. I’m done 90% human race. wanted upvote 420 bad. Really good news seeing ER visits steadily decline! must apologize knee jerk reaction. wrong idea coming from. Typically someone quotes numbers large causalities cataclysms intention downplaying current situation. Either truly believe bad want make feel better. terrifying truth absolutely idea going turn out...

 Epidemiologists scientists make assessments data gathering adjust patient care focus research. 

And right there's nothing wrong sizing problem. feel can't adequately assess current problem we're going it. opinion though.

Again apologize comment wrongfully full assumptions. fell common internet mistake. Yes care #1 themselves. Yolo. 

Btw telling rest world Fuck it. least Cheyenne sense call Frontier Days year. Already there. Staying home much possibly can. recall Donald Trump ever working research, development, clinical trials current vaccine candidates. I'm sure masks name calling people barely related ACTUAL development approval process vaccine relevant approval safe effective vaccine? approve administration's handling pandemic, believe me, need recognize difference federal government scientists working tirelessly put end pandemic developing vaccine making widely available world. sinking feeling that’s Desantis trying hard appease Chief Malfeasance. knows need federal support balance budget obvious everyone big guy plays favorites. Remembering we're lucky, get *be* elderly one day. gutting social security also gutting *our* social security. 60% 55% turnout actually way better elections. That's bigger margin lopsided presidential races. RATM/Tool/Rammstein summer concert line :( 

Already got confirmation RATM Rammstein next year though, glad kept tickets instead refunding! think may nothing could done. Would people accepted locking NYC first case New Rochelle? No. would ignored it. would said nothing worry Oh, I'll still get it, likely exposed already, want die quite yet. wonder many people, read things like that, decide take chance limited-studied vaccine unlikely help them, even get it. 


I'm sure answer is, tbh. would news certainly current iteration government medical advances still able prevent us reaching death toll (by percentage population) greater equal 1918 pandemic. Comparing death tolls pathogens wars honestly apples oranges, good headlines. Comparing outbreaks better job showing bad job gov doing. first threshold showing blew past flu death numbers USA.  None old growth growers Humboldt kind cash lying around. many greenrushers trashing environment folks hills came back-to-the-land movement barely afford food property taxes.

Prop64 absolutely legalization. We're allowed grow six plants personal use. trouble finding sun grown dispensary learned ask ""bottom barrel cheap stuff"" last year.

It's probably lot worse now. Lincoln Project great anti trump ads. Make mistake though, they're still Repubicans. January 22: “We totally control. one person coming China. going fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut coming China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus much control USA… Stock Market starting look good me!”

February 25: “CDC Administration GREAT job handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's problem that's going go away… studied it. know much. fact, we're close vaccine.”

**February 26: “The 15 (cases US) within couple days going close zero.”**

February 26: “We're going substantially down, up.”

February 27: “One day like miracle, disappear.”

February 28: ""Now democrats politicizing coronavirus, know right? They're politicizing it…they clue…they dont clue…this new hoax.""

February 28: “We're ordering lot supplies. We're ordering lot of, uh, elements frankly ordering unless something like this. we're ordering lot different elements medical.”

March 2: “You take solid flu vaccine, think could impact, much impact, corona?”

March 13: National Emergency Declaration

March 13: “I take responsibility all” company use Epic department's director talks like best thing since sliced bread. use Procentive, everybody says terrible, got flaws bad. inability understand simple data that's easily publicly available ain't may work fine production studios obviously nothing theaters themselves. Strikes odd. started happen soon Hospital data taken away CDC Whitehouse.

There anything new happening, everybody shopping. People masks etc. Everybody partying restaurants.

So I'm bit skeptical correct numbers. Unfortunately us see lack mask wearing stay home. people fight masks, less want go spend money. never hit come close, true death toll drop cliff around 200k 8/9/20 mean, headline “Chris Jericho Uses Bathroom Doesn’t Wash Hands Prior FOZZY Set Sturgis,” l would agree. 

However, knowing pandemic occurring large portion people don’t really take seriously, hundreds (one whom, statistically, must COVID-19) attendance go interact thousands more, certainly appreciate knowing happened avoid area anyone anything it. I’d tell it’s decision whether continue pregnancy not, it’s hers. Now, whether sticks around afterwards definitely decision. doesn’t want kid, anymore pay child support that’s mother wants do. Excess Deaths already indicates actual count 200k. Well fascist reign total.  Saw news talking guy Sioux Falls. asked worried people going Sturgis bringing virus back, said “Look, nothing happens Sturgis stays Sturgis. Coronavirus, STDs, arrest warrants.” also give horses. believe read somewhere sometimes used humans Lyme Disease well. father first president Planned Parenthood. Sanger carried much baggage Eugenics views. We're already well 300k, acknowledge it. Explain, please. people I’ve said seem appreciative (mind you, I’m interrupting someone’s work make point). Well, spa could, worried risking losing clients safety. 

My advise see allowed install roomsized HEPA air purification filter room possibly fan move breath away you. 9 many? many false positives? got tested showed positive showed symptoms 24 hours later tested place turned negative. Basically. months ago would shocked hear allowed. I'm equally mortified, I've come expect now. think Cuba, China, New Zealand, etc. would play along too? ""hahahahaha"" yeah reason fucked are. official (page 9) RKI shows numbers July. Countries exposures reported every Tuesday! Or, they’re good enabling places go Trump+20 anyway, pretend care (but noti swings course). ""Anything else"" may involve self-improvement taking care others, obviously important them. Dam must hard go amputation, nurse taking virtue signalling route. worked pain, weekends pain... point, ignoring pain. feels better thinking sacrifice. think go tell families loved ones years past died flu wear face masks bad. I’m wondering Florida get tired wining. Actually, anyone government could call General Strike organize former party officials.

Imagine Obama Biden Sanders came national TV said way fight virus gather solidarity teachers essential workers stay home, stay safe, current administration refuses to. Thanks background Friends, connections, etc. People need realize covid exists people need realize people varying levels peer pressure tolerance despite knowing whatever know. know everything still make wrong moves life; one flashes light stupid retarded moves made could sorta see susceptible. many parts country people following instructions. common knowledge dude.

The 300k projection put around August 6th. new projection based now, 5 months ago. current date suggests still need more. ""It is"" - Donald J Trump school opening. there's positive case 6' less away positive case quarantine. big school, hallways going packed. going go bad real quick. learn nothing whooping cough outbreak last year? can’t speak I’ve never lived rural America. lived highly urban parts country, currently 20th largest metro population. 

Rural America also far Midwest, I’m sure we’re talking thing here. course he's talking America, thread coronavirus response America. Yeah young. hate old people literally touch anything. I'd bring bottle water portable soap me, avoid touching anything. fear. reality. We're disease ravaged, horrifically infested nation. countries build wall prevent us coming in.  


It's part ""great"". Yeah I’d argue Italy’s numbers went due much vulnerable population infected front. New Zealand closed borders super early, leaving tiny outbreak deal with. lockdown probably didn’t even much compared fact borders closed early vote too, that's depressing. subreddit full bunch NEET hermits can’t fathom anyone would want spend time bar. mind everyone isn’t like evil, evil people right leaning. government stepping shut down??? single event unrivaled potential spread outbreak ten fold. allowed happen??? Bonus: Work ab muscles free gains! What's point? know Eastern Front existed majority dying happened. dismiss parts war peoples sacrifice? Well get groceries delivered. things steps take minimize interacting idiots, else become one. Arizona turned shit around (no thanks idiot governor), possible.

Masks, enforced restrictions gatherings. work. organized teacher's union would great help counter nonsense. staffers health must considered decisions. good union could call in-school instruction practices question. Staffer PPE? Moving teachers around rather students? Lots options endanger staff. Dude don’t know. straw man argument I’m apparently asshole don’t want see hospital overwhelmed Covid19 cases needing ECMO. taking chances. honest, I'm paranoid, I'd probably keep bottle water soap backpack roadtripping, reason. works human body develop long term immunity, every corona type virus simply wishful thinking.
And leaves issues long term bodily damage due infection, lungs, kidneys, heart, susceptible prolonged damage, don’t idea yet, body recover. people die every year common flu died war. Go figure. depends teacher sub for. Last week 7:30 4. car duty. didn’t get breaks, ate students cafeteria ran restroom could. Nah, meant Nukes used WW3. That's wipe out, sticks stones used ""WW4."" said way put great perspective. Lady, I've pushing masks since February government Health Canada lying us masks dangerous. I'm masks way, I'm pro-mask person entire country.

Anti-maskers scum like anti-vax scum. braindead religitards conspiritards.

Asymptomatic transmission one biggest challenges virus especially due long incubation time.

I bewildered think I'm masks.. idiots picture saying ""my rights"". counter ""my rights"" right infect others viruses.

Stay safe thanks hard work. things. One, mask wearing back then. masks proven weaken virus. still catch Covid wearing mask, may difference stay hospital common symptoms treated home. Two, back NYC hot spots getting slammed. didn’t luxury shutdown prep hospitals. last mostly uneducated guess think majority country approached herd immunity, especially consider asymptomatic rate. We’ll continue see waves, hopefully smaller time. pretty cool idea. try US! sure back then, would easy days smartphones. order pay app. Facebook - important medical information found. Can’t believe needed ask. There's hypothesis gaining traction based findings four different labs T-cell memory previous, similar coronavirus infections may acting significant chunk population - around 40%. Which, way, percentage people asymptomatic. person still gets infected, body mounts robust immune response quickly easily. 

If that's case, right still big ""if"" I'm personally becoming convinced, something 40% headstart herd immunity. would make 20% figure fit perfectly time cases start declining sharply 60%. I'll take non-rushed, fully vetted vaccine one ready. 

Everyone else free test subjects then. Religion. reduce IQ one fell swoop... 60 % people fit description? us first half, ngl starts comparing months covid versus whole year cancer, logical leaps.

The rest equally waste time Less initial line up. health care workers anyone wants gets I'm letting idiots make dead broke form medical bills. probably family members recover fully might think it’s hoax much likely. Tests backed 2 3 weeks, states even longer. accuracy ""results 15 minutes"" tests debatable (a decent amount false positives, presumably decent amount false negatives well). parents can't afford drop everything take 3 weeks work kid exposed, probably happen often. NZ intend isolated world next years? also agree quick test. need get manufacturing one president congress get everyday. get going life. can't stay locked years. people century demonstrating careless stupid behaviors. ""new normal"" nonsense. I'm Midwest anything like 12 years went school started 1st grade 1953. thought past moved here. shocked one grandchildren got trouble actually choice punishment-take 5 swats 2 day suspension. even bigger surprise took swats! yeah, real. parents sign waiver want school year, mandatory, real. contextual irony opinion hilarious. apart BIONIC, around long time Bitcoins. Folding@Home people. big question remains, reinfection issue? reinfected, second third fourth times worse preceding infections? governments choice... 

your neighbours differently... see us bitching them? Nope.. go norway ! We’re doomed economy reports earnings quarterly. 

For shortsighted folks, “one lousy year” probably feels like forever. Cluster festival? neighbour virus thank much
for us roughly equivalent winter's cold.
I case already surviving relatives
So no, mostly likely seeing people carted hospital likely interested vacinne something I've already had! one counts expression shame to.me. trying Coronavirus vaccine decades, especially China. virus mutates, huge problem vaccines. live new paradigm could years. false flags vaccines pR stunt conjob anything else see stock prices jump upon ""news"" often news. looks like bit coin miner dis guy troll, actually mean things says 5G? RFIDA? microchips? Sorry I’m downer depressing. know vaccines never 100% vaccine possibility 50% effective, still important saving lives, discouraging things ever anywhere close “normal” again. 
I think holding hope could hug friends family gathering send kid school go bar without someone dying back mind seems relatively futile point. Parents come child care summer costs hell lot money many parents can't afford year round. realize single government warning people long-term damages, actually going major burden disease? government funded long-term studies ""recovered"" patients. hard survey couple thousand confirmed positives 3-4 months later? 

They basically hiding it, want know, want accept. Liabilities, insurance costs, unemployment money, whatever reason is. 

It easier say ""It psychological, making up, lazy work"" instead researching confirming it. vaccines won’t get? proven dangerous? what’s source information? tide pod eaters, anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, flat-earthers, bird box challengers, Tik Tok toilet seat lickers, assaulting coughers name few. Use idle PC keep cracking it, better trying mine entire families third-world countries subsist less dollar day. big companies lobby hard enough, might able exploit people guise ""helping"" them. I’m enter 13th year teaching, would NEVER become admin. You’re going take away one part job that’s enjoyable fulfilling replace paperwork money? Hard pass. Unimed kkkkk
I agree though, base protocols WHO’s guidance, ones said masks didn’t work long time start, said aerosol transmission unlikely asymptomatic transmission occur, didn’t object valved respirators now... Well, that’s smart, imo. I’d give another 6 months. then, I’ll wait facts reputable sources. work assumption people poorer years come securing long term individual success now. Common people struggle least 5 years like 10 though parts world things managed quite alright. hope. Crazy quickly conspiracy memes evolving now.  Compare Canada US Coronavirus better understand point. cant? XD hahahaha

Since mediocroty make rules? Oh right.. univeraal suffrage :/ really. believe anything thrown them. won’t listen majority doctors. listen potheads living parents basements (no offense people, sometimes life puts there) spreading virus help economy? me!! honestly, country would expect people take extra-precautions country pay healthcare lose job lose HC insurance. really understand stupid selfish adult be, mean even thinking hoax i'd still say ""well i'll wear mask case, want pay thousands dollars healtcare cause spared 50 cents mask"" stripped “coping mechanisms”, whatever stay try get sane... earlier show old games sports, sure still are. 

I’ve come accept need find new ways “deal” things get ugly me. struggle least aware whatever isn’t going work anymore matter much put head sand pretend isn’t happening...

I want emphasize struggle MASSIVELY find new ways cope, I’m dismissing anyone’s difficulty same, matter deprived of. I’ve read 100 news stories last three months different teams “very close” complete.

Close counts horseshoes hand grenades. going way that. all, they're children. chances never one? judging news regarding past three days headed direction? photos show boats jet skis rafts. Expect several downvotes brigade doesn’t matter diverse California is, it’s still America, still subject failings. 

The rest world things like actually provide education young people healthcare sick people. culture change alone wanting population stupid sick/bankrupt enough disqualify CA model world. Ouch.

You may correct, putting succinctly painful behold.

You tagged, way. tag Reddit users best lines way keep track never pay attention user names.

That statement worthy tag. Take care good luck everyone Sad part large number deaths could avoided. shocked. quite recently, FAA CDC highly regarded abroad. can't measure loss credibility American institutions happened years, trusting FDA (especially administration) would probably seems quite natural others countries. Fauci warned us would happen. Plus lot single parent homes parents working necessarily. Yes may never get vaccine covid also important remember we've never really needed coronavirus vaccine before. SARS example never really reached west got control kind died vaccine made never much focus vaccine. first time actually really need coronavirus vaccine learned year reading Indian coronavirus stats.

Now I'm jealous. want single English word 100,000. Ok, good advice. Thank you! That's little reassuring. like Q tips saying intended inserted ear. laws require statements everyone going ignore, people can't sue. 28 Days Later expense sounding like crackpot: trust sort case death count? Well anti-vax kids live long enough breed anti-mask idoits likely catch potentially die gene pools hopefully dry Thanks response. economists wrong 500k job losses overnight recession? Sorry I’m confused could conclude this. Train would take much time, see safer choice. Something consider. Yes, wrong. Even sat back nothing, would wrong choice, world would continue fine. Pretty sad, model do. area already shortage bus drivers... need change glasses go see doctor. new 42% Americans age 40. least give us taking virus seriously priority getting vaccine first still running around infecting other. know vaccine safe number go up. but... but... health authorities saying ""Vast majority recover completely 2 weeks, notice all"". IFR 0.0000001%, also I'm 95 years old perfectly fine?  would really like share moneys need affected would never want donate single cent idiots ""masks freedom"" ""the virus hoax"". one solve conundrum. also might change there's actual completed working vaccine went public elementary school Southern California early-mid 90s. banned Looney Tunes gear, well Oakland Raiders gear association gangs. 



We like 20 gang-related shootings vicinity school there. mom pulled put private school bad. See countries like Singapore, Qatar, UAE(highest testing per population there), Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman many others able test due lower populations richer nations. Sad story. unfortunate set circumstances, sure. Sounds like it’s inconvenience whole town, it’s like they’re attached mainland hot dumpster fire. Now, would known would happen? 2 people think of... scientists say kids spread 20% much adults think it’s higher therefor unsafe criticism testing protocol? listen to? Doctors giving us real numbers resistors making observations conduct professional business? need create new normal. Masks social distancing foreseeable future. inexpensive accurate quick test would help lot too. still wear mask, least could visit friend family member, taking test without much worry spreading it. do. last wave hit Florida Texas, Arizona California even come close killing many people first time NY NJ. 40% deaths America nursing homes, governors really fucked up. treat thing time get back whatever normal open everything up. Small businesses getting decimated closing left right shit. know democrats want keep economy unemployment election, sadistic getting tiresome. time get going. virus kill % way less 1%. Old people Fat people ones need look themselves.  Yes, that's palliative care prescribed. fact prescribed cases general assessment individual one serious hope serious consequences people involved, cases like say palliative care euthanasia generalized statement opinion wrong. Unfortunately, many universities still plowing full steam ahead bringing students campus, even classes online. professors continue teach online, many staff expected person. really wish people would let person instruction go fall. can’t safely. We’re nowhere near levels transmission would make feasible. interview organizer, biker Trump, still believes pandemic hoax left stop Trump winning election. know, using corona hoax increase number mail votes, faking death, illegal brown people blacks getting uppity voting etc... Retarded word vomit like that. 

Here's link mention hogging medical resources unnecessarily. (The players)  living time see world without vaccine looks like yet people still vaccines. stupidity people never fails amaze mass shutdowns many countries destroying food supply chains poorer countries. Sounds good me. Well, yes listened doctor. culling wealth.

Rich people work home kids stay school. low income people go work ones getting sick. believe there's fully shaped developed mini person moment sperm goes egg calling fucking anti vaxer? feared Reddit became hive mind new low. grouping people en masse decide basis opinion popular not, even looking criticism blindly accept Nobody claiming school reopenings result **zero** cases covid infections. already allow activities low probability spreading covid, schooling different? think risk open schools, well, important open kids learn stuff.

Just agree zero risk. That’s incredible- you’re sick energy go phone interview let alone jump hoops diagnosis illness cure...that’s really helping health community gather data help you. nightmare. making easy citizens share report anything everything. lot countries finding loopholes testing data wrong hope guys feeling 100% recovered reality situation Israel directly contradicts this. 

&amp;#x200B;

We empirical data shows opening schools causes spike transmission. physically can't be, Ebola take infected dying could spread others. BLM protestors also protest home. can’t pick choose parts first amendment you’re going support support. Show facts please, missing masks. single photo. might able discuss facts. then: thanks interest! wouldn’t matter Covid not, natural state hospitals America nurses work double shifts time; understaffing rampant. Getting away paying people possible job meant people, make dollars, name game. Ahh America. Can't make us wear masks (cause muh freedom), parent's responsibility kid skip class. problem they'll never get right pricing, one buy gov. live IL prices ridiculous. $78 eighth primo... idea people afford prices. bright side maybe they're working new music since they're touring. Maybe new album 6 years instead 13? claiming 'only old people deathbed dieing give shit, gotta live' finding anything out?

It's getting plenty people deathbed killed.

Because that's anti-maskers doing. Illinois law legalizing weed made ppl convicted possessing less 30 grams eligible automatic clemency. governor also pardoned 11,000 people convicted low level weed offenses day law went effect. 15 minutes 6 feet masks. sneeze, cough talking loudly singing goes 6 feet without mask. That’s small tidbit always forget mention. Yeah true. live super small, ultra liberal town protests months there's virtually crime cops still shit. also mobilize get people path hurricane path temporarily. hurricane, might try help rebuild area help people resettle elsewhere.  think businessess trying market bio-safety good thing. ""Only 9 positive cases packed hallway? See kids don;t get infected spread much everyone saying. success. Open schools."" 

-school, district, local, state leadership probably Vehicular death crude argument. apples-to-apples COVID. point plenty deaths reported categorized likely caused something else.

Every single person dies *something*, die old age.

Here's better example. Imagine elderly woman nursing home family comes visit. 4 year old granddaughter little cold. always sniffling nobody really considers issue. rest family gets cold visit recovers quickly, people cold. But, lo behold, grandma gets cold. Due age frailty, body able fight off. gets pneumonia. Grandma put ventilator within week, dead days later. actually very, common elderly.

Would say grandma died cold pneumonia? Maybe pneumonia related cold. count cold deaths?

If like CDC, count pneumonia death. cold kill her.

Imagine kind root-cause analysis deaths there? Imagine counted deaths respective, related categories? kinds effects would policy public perception? restrictions number visitors, visitors age, nursing homes? restrict nursing home visitors entirely colds exist? Would restrictions, fact, increase mortality rate nursing homes elderly people can't see families lose live?

Those last questions extreme purpose. maybe *do* restrict access nursing homes due colds.

But that's point. point need accurate data order make decisions. Counting related deaths overall COVID-19 death number out-of-line we've reporting causes death. unique situation, course, arguing paranoia kill someone (suicides ODs), instead *reducing* paranoia?  really religious people know convinced nothing done protect God's will.

I guess presents mask will. Uhh except really people part still get infected morons Chinese New Year Jan25, Trump shut travel China 31Jan, Pelosi encouraged tourism Chinatown April16. Trump conflates Pelosi’s statement new year parade embellishes saying everyone big party. Basically said it’s safe visit, took precautions tourism. America: Hold beer Yep, this! 💯 Bless souls. remember hearing story idiot Japan infected ate restaurants spread coronavirus purpose. Thankfully, died later.

America definitely monopoly stupidity Karens. ☺️ never claimed medical professional. work infectious diseases government. Mostly finding tracking people want found nothing username go of. We're 7 months in, technology stop virus (HEPA) around 20+ years. things ""fast tracked."" Ridiculous, DPA properly used could stopped virus long ago Fair enough. good points.

I agreeing sending schools, remote seems like easy decision. trying say we're going find alternate routes socializing young children go route.

Not sure voted take. “childcare” system US horrible. We’ve built economy requires two parents work, system childcare summer. 

Yeah I’m using childcare broadly. point tremendous mismatch.

It’s ok families scramble months get summer, it’s sustainable facing fact. 

I don’t know solution is, I’m also charge. CA, $4K $100K, depending size operation. slightly better, still fucked up, still way Beer/Wine license $3-5K.

i fucking hate world live in. like corporations government work tandem keep us poor. even doors open, open us, open them. ex reason. politicians, scientists, teachers, citizens saying terrible idea locked start? Meanwhile, it’s projection Sadly tourist season Spain year. schengen countries recommend come here. south Spain holidays, usually touristic area found tourists abroad year.

Right posted exact title sub rules, assumption means terms increasing overall societal spread, kid literally can’t spread anyone. Bad title, interesting hopeful news It’s term neurodivergent people prefer, yes. going say thing. last four years taught bottom. it? sarcasm? Well quite rude. Reading original two comments responded to, think absolutely reasonable way read comments still believe correct one. “At least IT’S mortality rate isn’t 99.6%”, “it”... obviously covid. didn’t say least isn’t another virus higher mortality rate. could meant it, didn’t type someone proclaims medical professional show professionalism discussing topic Americans never leave home state.

This sounds made up. stimulus check wasn’t part unemployment benefits  local one 1743. trust even weather. Neurodivergent. Gonna use one.

Hmmmm..... 🤔 get arguement America super fucked, haha. public health experts saying this. people sub looking next thing complain about.

Focus getting people wear masks first You’re healthcare worker you? tell comment aren’t. would bet anything woman ignoring pain working extra shifts everything amazing pay we’re getting right much heroics. US citizen reporting in...we plenty evidence case. Many countries Europe, Asia, Middle East, gotten covid control. include rich poor countries, large small countries, democratic communist countries. anyone say covid unstoppable?

Coulda, shoulda, woulda terrible argument matters Captain Hindsight. Although agree reported numbers look lot higher impoverished nations due access testing... one stroll outside tell crushing Anyway paying attention calling since April. large portion U.S. population going wear masks, way get things control. make sense me. one holding pee 6 hours overwork, one also probably making sloppy mistakes. meant criticism health care workers work ethic. human being.

I read Chinese health care workers midst coronova crisis wore adult diapers standard urination defection required taking putting back PPE took much time. seems like better response telling people hold entire shift.

If health care workers take care themselves, ability take care patients degrade. gonna get arrested reserved people [maybe might possible commit crime sometime  Country-by-country elimination certainly possible, hard ask:

* Close borders, exceptions. Make arrangements covid-side vs non covid-side freight arrivals protocol keep sides isolated.
* Test everything breaths, time.
* Prohibit physical encounters outside household strictly necessary.
* Isolate (by force necessary) infected, close contact infected, close contact close contact infected...

3 months hell, followed splendid isolation. countries get magic 100 days / cases, travel bubbles begin.

Under nightmare scenario, vaccines fail, turns immunity lasts 12 months subsequent infections severe, may best hope. way stop this... sad... April 16, referred event Pelosi encouraging patronizing Chinatown. Trump shut travel China Jan31. Trump conflating encouragement tourism China town April new year parade, course isn’t accurate. Yeah, confirmed fake news today It’s always followed “thoughts prayers”. Don’t forget part. volunteered testing locally... say ""rarely"". Yes. students staff absolutely picked elsewhere. concern 9 cases fact present school past week therefore likely infected others picked school. Another stimulus passed. Trump EO unconstitutional declared soon. congress appropriate money lead would wait peer reviewed evidence. don’t think even us wanted get vaccine chance comes maybe I’m wrong. Well... let's real here, almost 100 years start WWII, still people deny Holocaust. headline says ""pupils pose risk.""

That's thought Georgia camp. go well all. Smallpox would like word. gonna drag global travel countries fucked long time countries control.

Except really fair compare two way. European countries existed much longer America, already gone much political struggles within democracy. We're hoping head direction, wealthy need get politics. unfortunately, see way American people change that. lose job? funny politics sides/supporters think they're right. One prioritizes health. prioritizes economy.

In really...they need find way optimize work together. stopping one side voting doesnt help neither alternative full solution. Welcome results anti intellectualism Trump getting reelected types need catch die off. Society would better whole. Lincoln Project ad. former Republicans. us care. Yeah.... know affects homeowners renters? wonder homeowners likely wear mask renters. course people losing jobs across board. Bro, delusional. lost talk make fool yourself.  think potential trauma beloved faculty staff hospitalized weeks dying. could cause lot grieving schools pretty traumatic younger kids. Well, Stupid Ages u believe golf course sell. Next stop: civil war. 

And anti maskers competing get faster :/ gave hope virus hit.  I’m boat, grandparents passed away months this. Actually grandma passed late February. travelled Michigan right shit went down. I’m weird way relieved got go funeral nick time travesty. Trump led America greater calamity WWII. everybody suddenly think they're smarter millions public health experts around globe working nonstop since discovery virus? like Trump saying we'll vaccine soon like commenters seem think. highly doubt many world leaders scientists would putting faith vaccine seemed dangerous botched. Unless theres actual evidence vaccine dangerous, I'll side experts one. *surprised pikachu face*  understanding feces huge amounts virus them, seems like public restroom might well excellent place contract it. remember 100k first, like that's much around 60k. Many AZ went S.D. attend Sturgis Rally taking place. neighbor went large group week. Well, that's protest that's going get smaller real fast. Sturgis one big human trafficking events year. Many women free will. -- researcher publicly said think vaccines work fat people.


That's consider advice ""One 'expert'"" 


LIke Dr Demon Semen. Stop lying, everyone knows Covid eat breakfast doesn’t infect diners, bars! Oh no! 9 cases? ever do? USA, Germany, Japan : United Colors Stupidity

&amp;#x200B;

*note : live, there's lot jerks deniers too, tinfoil-hat medicine fans; ""no-mask"" protest… yet. (and often protest, know mean)* Ebola also airborne cleansing stupid. reason virus disproportionately kill idiots like this. Imagine utopia US become Karen's dead. 1) Extrapolating SARS-1 (f.e. )

2) Clinical observations long-haulers ( )

3) New clinical data coming ( ) I’m fuckin board ordered Halloween hazmat suit wear whole year. 1 died Yuuuuuuup dumbasse's can’t compare war pandemic terms deaths. 

Why not? difference ireland letting american rest europe not. worth noting Spanish Flu analogies well “For example, many people uncomplicated myocarditis caused coxsackievirus symptoms. sign heart inflammation may temporary abnormal result electrocardiogram (EKG), test measures heart's electrical activity. echocardiogram may show abnormalities, decreased strength heart contractions.”

You describing complications myocarditis, universal effects myocarditis. I’m sure many links would post understand, last attempt. Myocarditis cause lasting permanent damage, always. see stupid also contagious. American completely unsurprised. examine deaths per million population, USA better Sweden, Spain, UK.

Remember US huge population 330 million.

Otherwise they’re disgraceful job it. people care majority population including anti maskers know someone died Remember ... POTUS said control

Actually, quoting beloved Nancy Pelosi **[who said time. damn, feels *so much* better blame Trump everything, it? Active may strong word, US injuries deaths occur period around 2 years.  “In 2016, 623,471 legal induced abortions reported CDC 48 reporting areas.”

(Source: CDC, 81 is, definition, almost 100. arguing, adding context additional information. Agree neither okay. perhaps afraid way deep, can’t even consciously access it. Exactly right, believe (but course double check this) covid similar ""coating"" feature. course, mean immunity summer! help little bit.

But mean people get lazy now, going much difficult readjust weather drops again. hope I'm wrong surprised fall spreading get lot worse. wish apple released goddamn iSmell sensor iPhone 11 Pro Max like rumored. maybe storied could told properly. See easy think death now? Prior covid politically killing couple hundred thousand Americans, people really freaked dying. Now, 'eh, I've lived long enough' no, dont, sudgestion enforced, retarded government anything would hurt bottom line, pubs open, social distancing, house parties, etting americans etc. There's even chance we'll hit 200k mid September.

300k end year seems improbable unless (currently uncounted for) fall wave states already schools open week. sad sit watch, knowing could prevented. 

Disclaimer: Yes, realize parents stay home kids. Yes, realize children get food school. Yes, realize school safe space children. extended social friend group could draw line &amp; stand ground, we're talking Family, tricky maneuver around, especially foreign country. Especially covid ravaging US, may thought back family's mind they're giving shelter put &amp; shut up. way move live somewhere else Ontario? way excuse gatherings? tf guys arguing this? Neither situation ok. SMH live area almost one wears mask feel need apologize, least explain I’m wearing one, mixed company.

I actually health issue I’m dealing with, makes easy excuse, even shouldn’t feel compelled tell people personal health problems don’t think I’m strange — something anyway.  forgot type valid counterpoint end. Thing is, lot people right 100 years ago. yeah still wont hit spanish flu numbers, even close months? vaccine? 

Everyone start plan scenario good vaccine atleast another 2-3 years. dont understand optimism behind vaccine. 2-3 years insanely quick development proper vaccine. Usually take many years show exactly backs claim people doubting? Specifically projected deaths *with* lockdown 1 million US? feel like I'm crazy remembering 'flattening curve' used mean 'everyone going get anyway, make sure get time hospitals overrun'. 

That goal, right? everyone talked about. seems goal always 'eliminate' virus US failed miserably, despite fact nowhere hospitals reached New York/ Italy levels bad, thought whole point this.

Look, I'll whatever experts tell us do, clearly know subject matter. lack cohesive strategy logical communication leadership really frustrating. day we've expecting finally arrived - India passing 1,000 deaths day. Unlike Brazil US, situation India cannot pinned politicians degree, take virus seriously try lock (except poorly planned). India's problem impossible millions slum dwellers practice social distancing. daily case numbers deaths growing like perfect exponential function week ago. Numbers seem rising slowly now, found top yet. So, we'd internal revolution traitors Senate made Chump King, we'd likely SAVED lives...? dangerous left alive! also tail end world war creating mother super spreader events. Keep mind many people spread to. doubled India’s death rate far, they’d still every single state continental US, save one calling Donald trump republican party nazis actually insult nazis since lead death Americans Hitler did. *He’s also encouraging people get train (Yamanote Line) together without wearing masks.*

Literally Corona incubating train circles around important stations Tokyo every hour. Lmao people shouting loudest reopening refuse easiest thing toward making actually happen? Yup Friends New Zealand asked ""the media lying bad is...""

They are, worse. amazed still wearing masks video calls. is.... Hey, keep gerrymandering side border... Chinese bot account something??? comments r/Coronavirus tons comments every day. Still fighting January-May 1944 Fair point, morbid calculus, PBS timeline states first year 'more 35,000 US deaths'. 

Could phrased better, i.e:

 'most deaths 2 year period point still stands' nobody cares us. Nobody cares Florida terrible unemployment system. Nobody cares paid. want votes election, happy see us drown sea level rises due global warming. gonna get worse massive population size parent comment said million with. Two million without. main number paper 2.2M mitigation. However also paper (first page) (emphasis find optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation suspect cases, home quarantine living household suspect cases, social distancing elderly others risk severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand 2/3 **deaths half.** (The paper goes say several hundred thousand deaths, however important note describing US UK, UK non mitigated number 510K. Either way categorization parent comment close enough accurate level squabbling seems counterproductive.)

By math, 2.2M x 1/2 = one million. hardly “crippling” pandemic 😂 issue.. deadly, spread easily. 1st World Country guys USA #1 appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* I'm confused mean. 

Are simply implying people can't receive say chemo treatment Covid hospitals dying home normal deaths? eyes might Covid directly due Covid. deaths shouldnt count Covid deaths influx home deaths number counts additionally.

## Abstract

The design immunogenic scaffold serves role treating pathogen, rapidly predictively modeled, remained elusive feat. Here, demonstrate SARS-BLOCK™ synthetic peptide scaffolds act antidotes SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated infection human ACE2-expressing cells. Critically, SARS-BLOCK™ peptides able potently competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding ACE2, main cellular entry pathway SARS-CoV-2, also binding neutralizing antibodies SARS-CoV-2. order create potential therapeutic antidote-vaccine, designed, simulated, synthesized, modeled epitopes, predicted peptide folding, characterized behavior novel set synthetic peptides. biomimetic technology modeled receptor binding motif SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, modified provide enhanced stability folding versus truncated wildtype sequence. novel peptides attain single-micromolar binding affinities ACE2 neutralizing antibody SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), demonstrate significant reduction infection nanomolar doses. also demonstrate soluble ACE2 abrogates binding RBD neutralizing antibodies, posit essential immune-evasive mechanism virus. SARS-BLOCK™ designed uncloak viral ACE2 coating mechanism, also binding neutralizing antibodies intention stimulating specific neutralizing antibody response. peptide scaffolds demonstrate promise future studies evaluating specificity sensitivity immune responses antidote-vaccine. summary, SARS-BLOCK™ peptides promising COVID-19 antidote designed combine benefits therapeutic vaccine, effectively creating new generation prophylactic reactive antiviral therapeutics whereby immune responses enhanced rather blunted. sure comparing pandemic's death toll war makes much sense. Apples oranges. compare past pandemics? could also say US death toll approaching 2004 Tsunami death toll. Remember summer heat would kill virus? Agreed. cases people dying state reporting increase deaths days together.. God knows true numbers are. lot die might dying way year. That's average age death high. think that; 70 percent, anti-vaxxers public menace. Let's hope vaccine 85% 95% effectiveness range. even hopefully, maybe even vaccine prevent infection, make covid infection less serious. common vaccines. Vaccines way less consistent used believe. so, I'm fucked. spend early 20s couch surfing smoking stimulants kids. Thanks. lazy look up. doesnt mean reach poor people countries time. looked happened PPE Kushner  NZ likely get community spread one day NZ can’t legally keep foreign NZers coming “home”. can’t believe many entitled mofos come back escape free 2 weeks hotel.

 Basically, strong evidence support well people wearing surgical masks public. US Centers Disease Control Prevention [put ""No recommendation made time mask use community asymptomatic persons, including high risk complications, prevent exposure influenza viruses."" bunch people think freedom wear mask important others getting sick dying.

Ideally government would providing support parents make choice, least honest risk choice parents make informed one. Wrong, gone summer. Heat kills covid yet none die. *work cheap, die oh well, poor people desperate need. Man know plenty parents want kids back school.

They want house bring stuff like Santa Clara study suggested 54 times people covid previously thought lowers fatality rate like 0.3% well whole “they count anyone dies coronavirus death” argument wonder much effort put that. positives siblings - they'll expected quarantine track sibling's classmates interactions require also stay home? public health department live considers people within 6 feet minimum 15 minutes someone tests positive. ...and distance learning better dying unnecessarily.

nice try big words though. government run website. owners free ban whatever speech choose. That's freedom speech works. actually one hypothesis South Korea study (write-up links found smaller children seem spread virus less kids 11 12 - 17.

That said, growing evidence airborne transmission occurring confined enclosed classroom likely good combination. response basically 'hopes prayers'. Don’t even temp fucking list places can’t go provide social benefits don’t have. bet fucking healthcare doesn’t bankrupt too! Correction: *actual, true* infection rate. rate ""mysteriously"" drops testing capacity deliberately reduced. There’s remnants past viral infections throughout human genome.

My question theoretical though. Could theoretically stamp took care stay home order two weeks, everyone isolated virus simply took it’s contagious course two weeks people couldn’t pass on.

Bruh Ok thanks! getting bit tiresome UK press still using figures known wrong. daily PHE death figure meaningless due flawed methodology. someone Covid-19 April, recovered get hit bus last week died would still counted Covid-19 death. worse Metro actually wrote article explaining still merrily report inflated daily figures like facts. They're purposely misleading. rectified would suggest everyone ignore daily figure. Scoreboard still says W many kids testing positive 2 week period schools went back? number seems kind meaningless without knowing before. thought title US came across word ""Indonesia"". Nah. slave. use money get without too. Creativity beautiful thing. Go buy things-be happy. really hope people start see horrible Florida large chunk residents stop going there. 

I know pipe dream sandy beaches. would serve place good decent people stop spending money support shitty people politicians. Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King warned second national COVID-19 lockdown may imposed UK next month. they? keep reading schools opening despite covid. American school calendar mystery me. Doubtful IMO knows. Since we've basically gone masks determining factor virus growth supression, see get rid them. combo masks distance. many people actually distance masks now? seems me. People view masks option distancing. 6 feet away, need mask thinking see pretty much everywhere don’t know you’re getting downvoted. It’s pessimistic, sure, also likely accurate. nationwide protests people outside, many without masks, chanting shouting studies afterwards showed lead rise covid cases. even saw studies claiming covid cases decreased protests. would seem data indicates outdoor transmission covid kind rare even environments people distanced singing, shouting, chanting, etc..... going on. concern rally? article cite says 40% never leave country. figure 54% refers people say they've visited 10 fewer states. things said would do, actually spread virus.

Sorry comment sounds rude. Autism isn’t really mental illness it’s hard see connection.

Someone row got infected, literally across Tom, already upset returning. test took 2 weeks get results back (he fine), pretty disappointed nothing changed weeks.

Worth trying out, imo. Jericho match Orange Cassidy coming could either jeopardy cause AEW wrestlers become infected well. 

Y2COVID19J. Good one. going say Trump wins again? Mail voting works though, great degree. 

Yeah, I’d rather mail votes instead spreading pandemic. working different vaccine. isn’t working thing across different companies allowing faster data gathering, race fastest vaccine skipping normal protocols. 
If vaccine available tomorrow, know long term effects longer 6 months? reason takes multiple years. Good one! LOLzed! “Zombie apocalypse $500 Alex”.... don’t like money, go live woods build cabin stay rest life. Sorry bottom capitalist society, clearly makes bitter. Luckily opportunity change something life. Tell me, device accessing site with? cost money? device made corporation? electricity come from? food come from? shelter? things cost money. 

Hating people actually want make money, top ridiculously morally righteous towards them, doesn’t make better person, makes naïve. slaves money. accept it. Go ahead, write response device cost hundreds dollars lecture morally superior don’t “worship money“ like apparently do. I'd rather wait second wave vaccines sign first, make sure unforeseen consequences.

When vaccine shown clinically effective little side effects, I'll first line, think people sign first round might end partial guinea pigs much winning! yes right. we'll get hit hard next weeks. manage another lockdown cost alot many people protest comes make everything even worse That's equivalent US 800 deaths. Yeah see Australian government really cracking them. Republicans best response covid... take “world”

Go read manual dick heads Flood mitigation costs money governments want spend = area remains unprepared flooding = area gets flooded costs millions billions damages = flood mitigation costs money governments want spend

It's common documented problem field. Open RI, 😣 You’re throwing stereotypes.  Anti-vaxxers extreme minority.  Change question get coronavirus vaccine determined safe effective 42% decrease big time. hit right head, “willful ignorance”. society become close minded, horrifying makes really sad see devolution way life.

This payoff years corrupt assholes charge (looking congress)...

Term limits would helped here, ship never even made water. feel like i’m going crazy watching people live life like nothing ever happened.

my snapchat instagram stories filled bars, parties weddings.

all “it kills 1% people old”

yes you’re also obese gives least 1 preexisting condition.

man feel like 20-40 years people generation (Z) seeing advertisements saying “if contracted covid-19 may qualify free test check organ damage”  Possibly. music teacher starting private piano voice lessons fall, getting ton interest ! consider small group music classes kids homeschooling, 1-2 families max I’m using church it’s large space use masks etc. possibility need make money. 

The online tutoring general ed support, future still taking shape me! figure insurance thing, part nightmare! Clash back Joe Strummer still alive. Well quote nobody tends make things seem made up. taking post? term like aneurotypical? diverging from? Yes lungs already damaged get covid dead  could true. live district half stay home moms (which majority here) sentiment. I’d wager 75% don’t wear mask believe it’s hoax. Hardly see anyone wearing it’s needed. Still lotta rebel flags flown around too. kind gathering later today show support school system teachers. Honesty it’s bad situation around, digital learning do, others don’t choice. school board voted even cases going chance counts weren’t high neighbors. Looks like catch time. def trump country. Yeah, I'm anti masker certainly advocating wearing mask. overwhelming majority people US wearing masks. small, vocal, minority isn't. I’m autistic, neurodivergent majority people know also neurodiverse prefer terms neurotypicals use Oh, that's true. need multiply 5,500 then? Lol. really think that’s going happen? saying number needed order you, personally, take seriously? Good luck idiots It’s used hours kids gone. Someone would move unit room room cycle completed, another reason would difficult make work school, would likely need multiple units. It’s safe I’m sure would differ cleaner parents would say disinfectants school chooses use long pass regulatory requirements, does. People definitely personified states.  Every state basically seen one stereotypical representation state, determines whether people deserve live die.  People want Texas die, Florida, Georgia, Arizona, New York New Jersey enlightened people/states thus deserve live (even though I've seen plenty anecdotal mask meltdown videos places - cause - bear - states big diverse one kind person them). Counterpoint: borders eventually open up, it’ll hit Canada. many Canadians come shop vacation. hope don’t let guard vaccine *hopefully* arrives end-virus gonna virus I’m done stupidity. entire initial argument nothing coronavirus does. nurse directly working patients coronavirus. Explain nurse working coronavirus patients NOTHING coronavirus. would rather use system people's votes counted?

We handle mail voting well handled Covid....incompetently.

There already primaries nearly 6% votes (Virginia) rejected. Arkansas, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Minnesota 2 3% rejected. New Jersey local election 9% ballots rejected.

Scale national election already strained postal system recipe disaster. Imagine 2 3% votes rejected probably optimistic.....that's millions people who's votes count. dad literally argue Trump saying since he's protected, tested people around tested thought it. need think it. Um...what? everyone making less $75,000 year gets full $1,200. make money get less money, even accurate. BC says highest single day 145. never happened. happened take breaks weekend reporting cases... 145 cases actually due loong wrekend:
There 43 cases Friday Saturday, 29 cases Saturday Sunday, 46 Sunday Monday, 28 Monday Tuesday. They’ll start treat like flu. “Oh, you’ll sick while” it’ll take someone surviving mean something. ‘Merica!’ 🤷🏻‍♂️ mean? sharing solid information months certain sect won’t accept it, don’t know expect. Dumbest thing ever open borders summer holidays... skip shitty beach time once. It’s like Germany enough places holiday.... It’s term prefer, told this? I'm France definitely wear masks practice social distancing. *Which go office vacation*. over, definitely better.

School back yet though, honest worry. New cases rising consistently there's way going back school going make things better. France called want statue back Denies gravity real, jumps roof. ""I thought Road Runner cartoons real."" Imagine coming trying mansplain expert subject do. There's lot unemployed people world point able get infection levels point test trace effectively meantime basically wait idiots catch start exercising caution I'm confused best explanation Google Sturgis biker rally. explain you. says that? 


The manuals? 


Manuals?


What books? Probably gonna happen. school person? straight quit job. 

Our income going take hit, can’t work homeschool three kids time. Plenty parents can’t quit though, it’s important can, do.  really can’t say. quote Dr. Leo Spaceman, I’m pretty sure must staff physician school district, “Medicine exact science”. Vietnam well greedy assholes smuggled illegal immigrants China country currently around 20-30 community spread case per day. Yep, island definitely help one gonna sneak country swimming there. think dropped this: /s get agree you’re saying pandemic thing imagine schools disrupted for. Mate. There’s difference antibody test, misinformation arrived from, virus test, actually used numbers. Stop spreading misinformation, you’re harming others. Stop pretending children completely safe dense kidney bean. Makes sense... Montreal, police say noticed increase speeding general disregard safety lockdown, so... yes... restaurants even open Florida moment? like want infect entire population. choose brutal manual labor jobs minimum wage warehouse/ distribution, construction trades, assembly line manufacturing, meat processing plants farm labor (last two suggested Free Republic). doubt it. Agreed, go work get company believes sustainable. husband also worked remotely since March. we’ll continue work remotely full time (we don’t jobs done hour day), also figuring teach 2nd grader 6th grader home. It’s going completely suck, we’ve also already multiple medical issues summer. Got first bill $10k last week. I’ve negative PTO since beginning August. Oh yeah, spending $1k air conditioner July, get spend another $1200 fixing drain pan coils started leaking last week. It’s going take least week get parts fix it. get figure keep gallon water ruining hardwood floors every 2 hours. It’s fun couple days. School starts August 19th.

We’re fucking done 2020. ""I'm...not...really...sick"" *beeeeeeep* would chip be, though? Track go? would want that? would go trouble Google already makes map everywhere go? would bother something risky vaccine? single independent researcher looks vaccine notices chip? Like, whole thing so, dumb. Choose what’s best family, fine time self reliant.

Fuck that, that’s like saying able choose drive drunk. endanger around following government health mandates, population proven dumb realize stupid are, one party morons wrong side history repeating mistakes anyone logic already learned. would bad guys weren’t stupid ignorant. literally doesn't. boxes, kids bring home. prone ICU.

I cannot believe many friends kids texted something along lines “I hope school stays open weeks virus shuts down, kids really need get house”

Ummm, kid somehow immune? Cuz little dead sweetheart may reason school shuts down. can’t see staying close touch half people life seeing indefensible reactions this. dip testing sites closed Hurricane auch good leader, really amazing watching Karen please 😂 sad here, friend. love French. attitude, thirst life (in every sense word), fan. you? permanent?

yes. Scarring permanent. exact location extent scarring vary person person, determine ""permanence"" effects scarring. Arkansas schools haven’t started yet. governor backing down, even reports come out. says he’s “firm” this. I’ll back work 4 days. I’m sick it. 15 73 million.  Like see rhe soxial justice warriors tell put mask “It’s everyone’s immune system weak social distancing mask wearing!!” Class 15 minutes long one day. Even assigned seats that's much larger exposure.

Between that, possible second generation spread variable incubation times fact spread via aerosol (especially without masks), vastly simpler shut entire classroom.

Of course public health live convinced schools go person all. /u/jaredpolis pro-mask rally already. Masks, social distancing, 


Do weekday, let people uncomfortable much public call sick work. Essential workers teachers well.


Shut things day. Show fools elected leaders outnumbered now.

A couple months early Non p5 probably yeah. need payday games make money. P5 think hold hope long possible. incentive structure bit different many players legitimate chances make NFL. dont think reinfection. relapse. virus secondary infection mechanism - filopedia, allow infection persist throughout antibody response. words, unknown percentage patients, infection chronic...

When Australia gets first case like this, confirm phylogenetic analysis. say? get hospitalization numbers? hard time tracking personally could clean bacteria existence would building Clorox factories antibiotics. ;-) Losing full year school make kids dumber. literal fact. disagree maybe *you're* one needs schooling. Yeah I’m really impressed found every positive case one flew radar. happen they’d asymptomatic. know illegal, can’t aid abet coronavirus 😤 something similar treatment therapeutic tracking? vaccine free manufacture? better tell Serum Institute India Gates Foundation DONATED money priced $14 per dose. Additionally, India vaccine court. 

So, basically, every single thing said wrong. Congratulations. Um no... remember jailbait sub. WTF? Question is:

School shootings dropped! :D

r/ABoringDystopia Yeah know passed safety trials modified vaccine shit hit fan China [Supreme Court disagreed since 1960. Benefit guaranteed. Brazil hit 3 million confirmed cases 100,000 deaths day. Payroll tax dumb. Unemployment ban Evictions godsend many hopefully people put aside differences least challenge two executive orders court. would hurt American people drastically did. Judging whole ""our side good, side bad"" mentality Congress, everyone challenge everything screw American people usual.

I like Trump, kudos taking bull horns Unemployment Evictions. ...and daylight hours, still make 9pm bedtime. Schools closed. services kids like counseling special ed. man contracted virus despite schools closed, they’ll likely remain closed services like counseling provided. use excess deaths maybe, see official count continuing pace. Victoria struggling. rest fine. context mind I'd hate someone trying learn English reading comments right lol. might actually believe everything said else become convinced Americans always doublespeak. Obituaries already section news. Someone writing unusual worth noting article. missing point solution democracy free ""the politicians done better."" That's issue politicians, system itself. makes sure date replaces swankier tracker comes every 2-3 years American stupidity contagious. governors going start taking seriously lock states down? know house fire,I wait higher authority say put protect people ""Propaganda"".

What mass murders/genocides propaganda according you? bit topic would think Portland Strip Clubs must weird acts. agree European countries mentioned higher deaths/capita. difference countries (maybe except UK) contained virus getting handful deaths per day. high numbers March/April Western Europe caught completely guard, like Northeastern states US hit time. contrast, US outbreak ongoing little sign slowing down, politicians large portions public taking seriously. US reach 500 deaths per million today, could pass Sweden, Italy Spain end September. Dude, growth rate still exponential, linear number total tests done, i.e. we're saturated limit total tests produced / processed per day. Luxuries conveniences human lives! like incarcerated freedoms taken away walk about, respect rules. matter long takes adapt strive make better become selfish individualistic comes social problems affect us indirectly inevitably. vaccine come one point, need patient!

Trust me, die without parties vacation trips years, virus affect health around you! They'd nothing Jericho lead singer March said 2 million would die California alone, so........ guess numbers kinda bullshit.  started also said fatality rate 2%-5% looking like 0.05% less, dont see big deal. people dying heart disease alcohol related incidents weak ass virus. get source? source claim American KIA ww2 400k breakdown age average life expectancy please?

In Quebec, 80% deaths happened elderly homes life expectancy homes less 2 years. people died couldn’t even feed without help.

Now I’m saying lives don’t matter, reason people abandoned families. taking seriously enough man. sound snarky never know touched pump you. Also god forbid use bathroom. Hiking isn’t minimal exposing anyone. It’s worth risk others. supplement vitamin I’m good. stay quarantined long takes, sucks I’m right side history. pray change mind. Cheers man.  Funny EPL went months without infection. many people high risk work shows too. incredibly selfish Chris, say big fan AEW work AEW. Playing music front couple thousand people worth potentially killing legends like Jim Ross Jake Snake. Well, us “terrible” people. look makeup government.

90% incumbents get re-elected fall, too. go. We’re dumb. 250-500k die flu annually. OP states. 250k people died since outbreak. So. forget simple math? Again, provided significant evidence US Italy influenced significant many China.

It’s ad hominem began directing argument *me* instead asking for: source illustrating CCP influence lockdown US Italy. many Americans died flu past 6 years? Damn man face mask experts told January. told shit hit fan y’all decided listen. looks still don’t. Dream keep blaming everybody else see brings you. Good luck that. 

Some words advice: Don’t lick doorknob! that, medical science vastly improved last 100 years, curbing many deaths might happened, Covid got 1920s. WTF talking about?

The Dems let Trump become dictator parts actually something.

Moreover, EO garbage stuff like ""recommend"" stuff. actually make difference. still young cases pass 5m best estimate actual infections? heard 10x recorded number 50m country 330m seems way high. 

Maybe 25m then? find zero comfort I’d rather behavior anomaly inherit part humanity. I'll wait updated version. get bugs PCR testing Covid minimum 20% false negative rate, depending exact day since symptoms started (3rd day highest sensitivity), even 30-40% false negative rate even people still symptoms. doctor, work, need assume Covid point. tests ruling conditions worthwhile, really ought get 2nd Covid test. wish widely explained people positive Covid swab test results reliable (it's highly specific coronavirus RNA), negatives pretty unreliable. Lol it’s genuinely reading graph. comment written 3 days ago. *still trending downward*. don’t choice. know Fauci now? Lol really, primates. learn watching others communities.

Lol convinced troll farms Yeah biggee, amiright? It’s sickly, weak, old. Wait.... blaming Dems here? Honestly, I'm probably looking it. right exclusively that. Thanks helping see side coin well.  People die alzheimers/heart disease/general organ failure getting test ""OH ANOTHER 'RONA DEATH!!!"" way everyone grieves differently? never get death loved one? Sounds like thing me. I’ve noticed number massively inflated COVID death toll rises. Apparently plandemic folks think flu kills 200k per year US. Adjust life years lost less Vietnam well 200k already look excess deaths Actually I'm pretty healthy. know others least exhibit hypertension. obese that. fact remains population curve flatten type thinking. That's he's ""confident"". Can't confident without data. article spinning fit narrative. I'd take odds, would help pay medical bill er. Imagine catching COVID wanted see Jericho's buttrock band much. Pepperidge farm remembers.  There's south korean study showing kids 10-17 spread adults. spread covid way adults middle schools &amp; highschools horrible places send kids pandemic. ??????????

 Trump make decision approve HDQ. focused Trump absolutely nothing research, development, approval covid vaccine.  evidence far clinical trials leading vaccine candidates point safe effective. see later year phase 3 trials concluded whether safe effective. choosing believe science, free get vaccinated. see one us ends worse off, either getting coronavirus, getting vaccinated.

US response indeed terrifyingly bad (total lack preparation, total lack coordination, non-existent federal response, etc), strong doubts Western Europe much better quite get ""astonished"" part.

The best metric gives reasonable idea severity epidemic deaths/1M population (yes, great either, case counts much worse)

UK,Spain,Italy, Sweden, Belgium still quite bit worse US, (and France 10% ""get it"" don't.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yea, confirmed. strongly believe actual 3x 4x confirmed amount. want look impacted US terms deaths, go death percentage. WW2 worse, COVID.

That's said. order equal WWII fatalities percentage population, COVID-19 would need kill something like 730 k people.

I surprised ends that, yet. hilarious even pretending contact trace 11 positive cases considering pictures saw. Dubious 🤨 pleasure! hope great day also! think understand ANYTHING viruses, diseases, people, airports, disease spread, lung, health, society? doesn't. cannot understand anything. Yea tiny lungs less viral material expelled probably. Although towering like adults do, it'll still go straight face actually worry. HIV instance stay dormant full decade progressing AIDS. tests showing people testing negative long term developing symptoms people experiencing worried. need bail anyways... Also think many people actually travelling aa expected. Friends mine HR ITA weeks ago. Reported pretty much empty places. 20 days husband's test result. San Mateo County, CA. may well even tested. issue is, describing estimated four million deaths almost *no* mitigation efforts, all, course several years. We're likely 1 million deaths, massive, world changing mitigation efforts, eight months.

Your stats belie point trying make.

And preventable illness children getting talking still COVID. first half. 100% agree. strict dress code, can't enforce wearing something keep people healthy? Bullshit.  RemindMe! 3 months Wait week, getting tested early false negative. Symptoms typically start 2-14 days infection (Yeah long window)  
Act contracted it, wear mask, distance. Keep eye symptoms. Buy oximeter.  
We started achy muscles, tired, cough started. Never got fever chills night sweats sucked. active symptoms 17 days. Still severe exhaustion, getting winded going kitchen trying load laundry. Onset symptoms 14th July. still check blood oxygen daily. 

Keep mind tests 30% false negative. get saliva test, accurate apparently. US steel, fuel, etc., responsible winning war, blood price paid almost solely Soviets comparatively, 20-27 million dead, bearing brunt German war machine entirety war (80% 1941-1942, 60% afterwards). sacrifices Russian people, Nazi regime would Europe Russia sole control. Russian people facing extermination, meanwhile sent 3x much UK, albeit much closer Russia.

Not mention atrocities inflicted upon civilians Japan (yes nukes, napalm bombings). heroes WW2, sat sidelines long could Nazis Soviets would tear one another ground. Later breaking promises made Soviets would handle post-WW2 Germany inflicting horrifically high civilian causalities wars come afterwards.

The Japanese, Russians, Germans Americans committed atrocities WW2, condemn stage say acted sooner? Millions civilians, Jewish, Russian, Slavic, Chinese lost lives WW2. Genocides must condemned ideally stopped late, failed stop WW2, failed stop many others decades afterwards (even day Uyghur ethoncide China). Perhaps made sense time isolationist lend aid terms supplies instead armies, mistake let millions die. European: “Don’t care?”

American: “We let numbers speak us” one gives shit anymore. moved on. Wear mask wear mask. stop Corona infatuation BLM protesters also wore masks part....opposite attending Sturgis get cost money. makes sad still denial phase there’s phases follow. work health tech. thinking making switch life insurance tech can't morally deal corrupt admins anymore. life insurance industry going bankrupt.

I mean world get Covid vaccine.

Also easier get New Zealand citizenship Australian New Zealand Citizenship work Australia live Australia long want.  supposed go Ireland year, too. excited. rate we’re going here, may never get leave country again. could predicted this!? told friend said, “so?” Luckily Midwest know slim healthy individuals. even date linked. One state data recent find. provide data wrong, gladly eat crow. can't.

Average age death 80 US. risk outside alone property pretty tiny probably need mask. probably hurting anything though, might anxious high risk trying overly cautious. I've occasionally read people using mask mowing try control allergen exposure too. Stagnant air like elivator etc measurably worse allows particles remain suspended longer period. reinfected within 15 minutes opening morning least they’re trying? 🤷🏻‍♀️ Nope Right. travel across state lines that’s trepidation comes in. I’m sure idiot standing behind grocery store road trip pit stop. I’m letting guard state’s positivity rate low. know? Exactly.

And that's positive cases rise everywhere makes sense criticize US nothing Europeans clearly interested confinement situation anymore. 


To assume EU done better job controlling covid fact way relaxed many US sates, makes sense. two days in-person closing Thursday Friday. school closed minimum 4 days get it. try ever say ""99%"" really mean ""the majority"", 99% specific number. just...I'm going spend time typing nuanced ways Trump hinted implied wear masks. summarized sentiment. good. mean, headline calls Brain damage. seems lot different articles I've looked refer outbreak using different terminology. CDC website specifically refers chronic fatigue, talking alleged neurological side effect pandemrix vaccine Europe. think google search engine existence????? First off, claims google are, again, bullshit. don’t like them, try another search engine. plenty. 

And you’ve basically established evidence you’re simply parroting nonsense. 

Use fucking common sense don’t buy bullshit easily. 

Edited add: you’ve seen “actual first hand knowledge”? Don’t make laugh. haven’t heard? numbers made up! Nobody know Facebook knows anybody hospital clearly it’s fabrication CDC death counts manufactured OPEN EYES watch evidence YouTube know TRUTH! /s

As long people exploiting pandemic build fan base spreading shit like above, take long time. fact people think like need disease family they’ll take seriously. sad.

They paraphrased statement actual speech issue incomprehensible word salad. spoke ""the position White House"" position White House completely insane. put lot overtime giving completely unserious President gravitas they'd give Eisenhower Truman. could, best, imagine ""Oh GAWD"" reaction news editor copy came in, picture thinking going make lemonade yet another disaster. 

And NPR. Yeah, kindergarten 8 wear uniform, high school Sure mentioned emergency use authorization, vaccine could administered completion Phase 3 trials, potentially helping flatten curve giving scientists little time study side effects understand interacts vaccines.” quoted it, first comment responded to. think live district talking about. parents mad one know either like flu. Yes, STILL saying flu. frustrating. 

Im happy though niece nephew attend school now. worried contacting virus giving parents. course parents worried. Sure, small population island nation's did, whole Scandinavian countries contain shit. Deaths counted without looking whether someone recovered?

I'm going way, way limb saying dead people recover. biggest problem Democratic party can't get other's way. definition ""perfect enemy good"". Republicans tight system ""get line dead us"". great system, just...you know, they're totally morally ethically bankrupt. Yes small minority fliers couldn’t used basis banning people. well understand groups... they’re sacrificing portion privacy expedited security checks. Ew. pointing alternative phrasing 'censorship'? People asking refrain using certain words actually power stop using them, they're asking use them.

Hey, discovered name next album! I've thinking getting motorcyle. wanted cruiser anyway. Honestly, think ask people. We're talking global pandemic killing hundreds thousands. Yes, absolutely put adult pants on, stay inside, adjust routines, suck motherfucking *deal it* sake saving hundreds thousands lives.

This coming someone who's deep pit yet another wave paralyzing shelter-in-place depression, fwiw. know easy. better spreading virus causing extra hundred people die. better comparison would expected remaining life years lost. pretty sure WWII would much worse. Ok, let’s take look testing, PPE, etc. label “Covid-19 supplies.” testing, US could asked received tests various governments international bodies instead developing botching own. Twice.

In case supplies states’ medical professionals need, supply chain horribly twisted appease ego also funneling supplies friends’ associates’ companies middlemen.

What makes think vaccine won’t benefit way one passes FDA me?

If Oxford vaccine passes governments’ regulatory bodies proven safe, “wait see” period speaking of. would likely public distribution administration amongst countries’ populations would pass FDA would able get it.

And that’s really unless somehow profit vaccine way, whether it’s financially, politically, both, likely lean FDA delay approval “for safety reasons” “that country/business bad” choice.

Instead trying browbeat morality lives lost someone much understands gravity situation, try understanding might reasoning behind situation. believe things quicker US cities.

In US, people refused tested. agree, get date go (about week) get results 2 US, keeps reporting thousands useless positives (because exactly suffering disease)

Uh? useless, even person asympotomatic. still spreader, need confirm person know also need test everybody got contact France, Spain Italy Germany experiencing considerable resurgence new cases.

France used 1000 deaths day, less 10 deaths day.

Germany less 15 deaths day right now.

Spain 5 deaths day right EU done US hasn't? countries period confinement.

That, USA that. New York, New Jersey California that. states half that, country close country acted differently Sweden. confined anyone stands, sensibly rate infections deaths countries.

Sweden deaths day going end june, 1800 deaths day. Every country Europe really low early may. Right Sweden still 300 deaths day, Sweden alone half death Europe everyday.

Well lot bs.

Typically government capability, staffed conscientious, responsible adults able put public health profit margins billionaires. England nowhere near herd immunity!

You could go out, pick someone wearing mask, get virus, feel perfectly fine, go back give else different reaction ends hospital. Yeah it, whats fuckin point right guys?! Let's go beach!  I'm seeing hearing elements too. teacher friends already back professional development telling administrators district leaders wearing masks nose taking completely.

New York 19 deaths July 27 Texas 97 date. doesn’t change fact New York 32,851 deaths. American ghetto, 10/10 would recommend. insightful Exactly, they’re vacation...so umm unless get called back talks won’t resume September. Hopefully we're seeing last days unregulated capitalism. 🤞  Cuz sole superpower world strongest economy brightest minds better average? fact we’re even better average. taken actions make spread more, dying out??? EU+UK 510.000.000 people 180.000 deaths, i.e. 360 per million less stable (less 100 deaths per day).

US 330.000.000 people 165.000 deaths, i.e. 500 per million growing 3 per day (about 1000 deaths per day).

Now shitshow? smh *The government expected receive bill approximately £60 million, 60 victims expected receive £1 million each.* 

 

940 dead healthcare workers due COVID-19 UK beginning June.

How much money families get? “I don’t like number I’m going divide 2.”

Based username, sound like somebody better grip math/science. CDC somebody else comes better estimate, makes sense continue use current estimate multiplying confirmed cases 10 Ladies Gentlemen! Please stand national anthem! Performed Sneeze &amp; Coughing C Minor.  Right still. One could find thousands photos people wearing masks protests. Doesn’t really matter virus doesn’t spread outside surprised right could well loud minority suspend person suspending. Fuck. makes tear cause I’m chopping onions aggressive manner. idea downvoted, that’s correct today.  Im saying dont know lockdown means.

Lockdowns include social distancing entire population closures schools universities. mentioned quoted passage different column table presumably looking at. think caveat noted Louisiana. state report Saturday (a fact verify Worldometers), Sunday's numbers also include catch up. Louisiana one highest deaths per capita country, 56 deaths day unprecedented. 2,700 new cases likely figure two days. You’re promiscuous sex every time exhale? lobotomy?  There’s checks coming. It’s fair worry. country closed borders 3 months, knocked Covid heels (Did new case weeks). small operate autonomously forever, opened borders (to all... influx actually came population going Florida bringing back, much actual tourists) cases grew 700% 1 month. 

My recommendation? US Government show signs actually something stop spread, go US to, lesser degree allow Americans without set criteria prevent spread. authority course, humble schlubs opinion based one small country’s experience thus far. Hmm wonder play global warming/climate change...sounds bad ya hear balls going sterile also? Double whammy shitheads! helps somewhat way stops it. sneeze still cause droplets thrown air mask. know. People acting like vaccine never bungled before. employ least bit critical thinking vaccine stamped “anti-vaxxer” stamp. think latter might happen sooner think. vaccine even approaching effective, give risk severe cases would rapidly see deaths hospitalisations drop. 

At point becomes thing live with, much like flu. Hospitals overwhelmed low risk groups need medical intervention get it. 

My guess would taking place next spring/ early summer. bet people don’t protected sex Last one 10million! Woo LETS GOOOOO shut would good, 100% positive tests absolutely good thing “in effect shut down”. you, Sheriff Hammond. public safety. is. recover young. old sick teacher personal responsibility. Can't let China Flu win. must fear. How's stock market main concern. /s And? virus never going go away, _inevitably_ cases schools. long hospitals overwhelmed original goal (flattening curve) achieved.

That's 39X return initial 150,000,000. pretty big financial gain, he's using pandemic advantage. Oh Ok. mean non essential workers send kids school don’t options available. worried kids. Best realistic immunity estimate 75%. recent poll 42% respondents taking vaccine. recent article read pointed vaccines significantly less effective overweight/obese individuals.

I like adds up. Summer camps, summer programs, summer sports, there's lots things usually occupy kids working hours summers. shut right now. I'm lucky kids old enough stay home, even would normally summer camp majority season. smart enough look *overpopulation* ?  see not. need win discussion , you? Women often told doctors pain real, absolutely believe ignored pain, also performed job expected level.  That's though. It'd nice was, isn't. Everyone's choices affecting everyone, even privilege/capability stay 100% inside house next 18 months. way around it. forget video games Still bad number innocent defenseless human lives eviscerated every year legal abortion I'm listening, go on... keep digging, we’ll never hit bottom. sure would nice get stimulus payment though. Maybe Donnie EO one, too. I’m liking sound kicking road student loan payments though, that’s really happening. Look! stupidity outside US!!! getting hit hard, taking seriously fact virus exponentially grown midlands last days trying nip bud. We've gone average 15 cases per day nationally 100 one county alone. Ah, realize talking MIS-C, thought speaking COVID.

Regardless - like parents taking children doctor stubbornness. reality *are* considerations, including exposure risk contracted it, global social distancing recommendations contagious is, dangerous groups. framing seems put blame parents way that's dismissive callous. Even takes 100 years need stay locked vaccine.  Hahahaha. Happy cake day Would run around shorts t-shirt middle unexpected snowstorm? adapt environment. different. guess refuse put heavy clothes drive slowly that's ""normal""? *Draws gun.*

Always been. Every person taking vaccine test subject, even saw happened midterms, right? talk Republicans blue wave coming, would easily hold power. senate seats grabs back then, would already looking different (not necessarily better) president. 

Trump losing November. corruption voter suppression sheer number apathetic citizens awoken crush him. Wait days.  Morons. Life measured length time times number people alive, number people. bandaids arm reason. Catholic school suburbia, gangs. Duh. need pull bootstraps harder. Sure. 97,000. staff don’t jobs. Cause that’s nursing home is. 

So hospital. That’s another cesspool. That’s goto one it’s last option. mean bs platitude redditors relate actual devastation small businesses going leave us future nothing amazon, Netflix McDonald’s? british PM saying basicly:

I give priority schools economy.

In way makes sense. Restricting people travel restricting contacts adults seems like way effective meassure restricting childrens movements / contacts. Children travel far school compared distance adults get work. would even argue people vistiting restaurants pubs wil travel children visiting schools.

Containing spread lot number people come contact with. many people come contact with. adults contacts grow way faster children.

During normal schoolweek child wil contact parents, teacher children school. may seem like alot right ? not. contacted people outside bubble through: Adults.

So, restrict contacts adults automaticly reduce amount contacts children have. parent teacher worried child: limit contacts, extra vigilant keeping distance interaction others.That protect children.

The virus fly school school. travels school school adults. I'd like clear, since we're betting now, believe option one **vastly** likely. I'm UK, vote Labour, American politics impact world especially impacts happens UK. I'm going pretend Biden good candidate he's going one worst candidates ever. People downvoting ridiculously naive think otherwise. Anybody going better Trump Biden progressive policies, course want Biden win. Biden pro reopening economy since April, that's America experiencing first peak, make promises wants fail see decisive leader crunch time.   Woah we're halfway there, woah livin prayer... pessimist might one positive people here, ironically. ;) good percentage Americans concept community common interest, largely thanks decades effort business interests.

Years job without significant raise? Certainly don’t consider forming union!

Unforeseen minor medical expense? Hope you’ve got least thousand bucks saved up, unlike businesses went belly moment pandemic disturbed cash flow. I'm pro-vaccine even nervous current admin might get compliant officials rush approve something needs testing prove works properly. vaccine failure effecitiveness, causing severe side effects, would hurt trust vaccines. need told front facts people know front say paritially effective 'go back normal' breath risk relatives yet. Keep masks something effective comes out.

I'm personally hoping one internationally tested ones gets first approval like Oxfords tested UK, S. Africa, Brazil, USA give good solid test wide variety people get best idea good really is. outside US hopefully give anyone trying hurry things cost make look good say November. subreddit, different articles saying vaccine work rich get cheap involuntary labour from? number many Americans died battle, real number ~497,000 2025 pretty extreme, think virus become manageable phase within another year two, without devastating death toll. course cause lose much money long-term Great argument, compelling, I'll definitely taking consideration. we're clear, af Abercrombie Fitch, correct?

This infuriating!!! unlike whiny abdicating teachers administrators daycare providers open essential workers entire pandemic. kids already programs bunch children 5+ months point. 22 yr old soldier vs 80 yr old long term care home resident. Whose death causes loss life? said one insanely idiotic things ever heard. point rambling, incoherent response, even close anything could considered rational thought. Everyone room dumber listened it. award points, may God mercy soul.  Yes, advances science since then. issue rush.

Salk’s research sound vaccine worked — rush get market, several manufacturers hastily approved. One manufacturers, Cutter, ended putting vaccine live polio virus (rather inactive). researcher NIH learned vaccine serious problems, warnings weren’t passed licensing folks company authorized produce vaccine anyway. Disastrous results.

The point rushing get vaccine sometimes go quite badly.


(Brief overview Cutter vaccine Yet Trump 74 year old Herman Cain Tulsa rally end June, drumming support black voters.

Several days later Cain went hospital Covid-19, died last week end July.

Yeah, stage IV colon cancer, 14 years ago.


Then 20% Covid-19 deaths U.S. people 65, 24% states like Mississippi.


At least 1/3 people work would qualify ""pre-existing conditions"". Overweight, diabetes, heart attacks, kidney disease, cancer remission.


So like talking feeble, frail, elderly people death bed, confined home here.



Who's going mentor teach 18 year olds, parents, uncle's, aunt's, grandparents drop dead? surrounded highly qualified medical science professionals foundation and... wait it.... *he listens them* student took picture suspended. unsuspended. article says unrelenting. noticed well.  need test kids school Well, mean it’s level infectiousness - thanks think plenty parents worried kids bringing home COVID. They’re equally worried able pay bills, mortgage, put food table, etc. many families, work financial necessity school provides education also childcare. Yes, absolutely parents idiotically don’t think COVID huge threat, many know it’s threat feel immediately threatened prospect able work therefore pay roof family’s head. 

It’s horrible proposition many families, see willing roll dice virus. friend single parent choice put kid daycare work right now. doesn’t want to, knows she’s risking contracting COVID, doesn’t choice. Unless pay parents stay home come better option (which think could put minds it), think there’s going parents want send kids back school, even knowing risk. It’s sad place country. question....if someone gets covid severe enough hospitalized allowed visitors. little kid? baby? means what? mistake 65 years ago shouldn’t get vaccine?  part ""Trump literally stupid"" understand? demagogue, narcissist, corrupt business man. “Wearing mask personal choice, practical way enforce mandate wear them.”

this stupid. trump’s mind kids get sick coronavirus. Look Trump. wanted reopen schools? seriously wanted reopen schools? agree. Absolutely it’s devastating. However, virus end entire world scenario, fortunately. Sadly, tens thousands. understand need look local incidence level affected regions/counties. national graph. Also need keep mind todays tests last weeks infections NPI need weeks kick in. ""Immunity hand, ,*a* primary reason.""

A reason, one possible one, obviously gross misreading/complete lie someone who's explicitly stating also reasons. consider ""fully vetted"" though? well fact, I’m surprised countries don’t recognize independent. shame. Unrelenting relentless unrelentless. word. Millions! sound like one conspiracy nut jobs. devil's lettuce illegal sir Exactly. I’m really trying part test group, find develop dementia 3 years future. Maybe something like 3/5ths?

 What? serious? sarcastic? Well opinion. perspective data seems indicate measures effective neighbors effective longer time. know that? Well public health agency analyzes movement patterns using anonymized cell phone data largest cell phone operator Nordic countries, Telia. see [summary Nordic countries. [Here data broken largest Swedish counties (Skåne, Västra Götaland Stockholm). 

So according public health agency, measures effective.

So caused excess deaths?

1. Elder care/nursing homes: lack PPE, poor routines handling infected residents. account 50% deaths Sweden.
2. Spread immigrant communities. Initially Somali immigrants greatly overrepresented infected cases special measures taken make sure made aware risks. 
3. Simply people became infected Sweden Nordic countries measures implemented. million Swedes (10%) travelled abroad weeks 7-9 winter holiday schools Sweden. Stockholm schools holiday week 9 (February 24 March 1) also hit hardest. Denmark Norway winter holiday week 8 comparison. Genetic analysis virus samples Swedish cases shown virus Alps, China Iran stopped Sweden spread Sweden today came places like North America European countries.

\#1 already well understood. #2 investigated detail [some this. guess #3 main failure. failure recognize virus already spread much world brought back returning Swedes health authorities focused places registered cases.

Trump republican party actually psychopaths completely different level everyone else. I've discussion co-workers. Would government able mandate employees show proof vaccination return work? show proof vaccination continue receiving UI benefits? sure legality it.

I take vaccine minute available. choice starving lack income either job unemployment taking vaccine, imagine anti-vaxxers choose latter. long ago this? I'm pretty sure vast majority people living Laura Ingalls Wilder dream currently. would understand literally last generation like this, cars internet globally connected world, like geographically isolated good reason completely incapable grokking situation worldwide pandemic. Unless suggesting due geographic isolation, care anyone else even though they're constantly around others modern world, would buy. Well people disagree public health lawyer public health laws, clearly people correct public health lawyer wrong. suppose they're clam makes even right. exactly SF government? 

FG ok - allowed virus care homes killed huge numbers early on, we're still 20 highest deaths p/million worldwide. response effective considered, still allowed borders stay open highly infected countries sake tourism industry industries protected given extra privileges, maintain good relations larger countries. Portland 70 miles away Mt Saint Helens. That's fair, though say 'a Hitler' subtlety indicate numerous 'leaders' questionable resumes. 

It bit jump part go Hitler, idea even wishing death nastiest people currently living seems garner negative response, seems like most/many people give second thought Hitler (because people pretty unanimously agree he's bad) like balls know  Well, Utah online porn consumption, balance out? No. 1 online porn subscriptions, report 203 new cases Greece one day, population 10 million. papers going stop conflating declining deaths herd immunity

Who says they're conflating them? says they're quoting top UK doctor herd immunity comment. rushed. another comment:

This also mention Oxford's vaccine passed safety trials far coronavirus Moderna working technology around eight years. engage one time.

Xenophobia defined prejudice people countries

That textbook example provided earlier, now. top off, denigrating character associating people real problem country. so, also made sweeping generalization I, individual, would provide value people Canada.

Also, know exactly diverse Canada worked several times previous tenures. Additionally, family, interracial international, CHOOSE vacation Vancouver Toronto often so.

Therefor, individual done much individual, non-citizen, lives thousand miles away, bolster Canada people live bringing business leisurely pursuits shores.

How, exactly make undesirable Canada? Answer: doesn’t. makes exactly kind person WANT come Canada stay type person would provide value around them.

Your high horse kinda short there. Especially since virus last terribly long surfaces. could close two days without ""deep cleaning"" probably similar effect. Shoplifting something worth dollar... Yikes Obama shit bag Trump, well every member congress. Anyone claims otherwise delusional.

 *corvid 🐔 Tremendous. even recent data (August 8th California, state done fairly good job) still shows average death rate upper end 75-79. 

Yes, ""still"" important, that's big signal declining early skew. go 80 75 78 couple months serious indicator. trend really clear: younger people getting often, killing younger normal healthy every day person virus hardly risk. arent old fat like common cold.

You right that: much deadly old, obese. kills young people every day well. Even percent, percent half million deaths, we're heading, *tens thousands* young Americans, downplaying strikes crazy talk.

And, really, everything deadly elderly. deadly falls really kill old people, 80-plus, still make handrails everyone. way likely die hit baseball (pre-2020) baseball game, everyone goes behind net. sisters entire family 5 early still anti mask person... 7 year old 105 fever day still gall share plandemic bs Facebook.

I'm saying never going possible, quick turnaround months seem likely me. Thanks man. Hearing say tough. got sick toy stomach sit down. I'm loss words, quite devastating thing experience amongst family. definitely doubts administration, urgency levels we're at, near infinite monetary resources, clear path vaccinated first (like know vaccinate), still little bit hope pretty quick.

Last week, 5 countries around 500 people died total. current rate 1050 die every day US. 

At current rate, ~1 month 2 countries Europe worse numbers dearhs per capita US Sorry cheeky first. Im jaded Redditors. want play russian roulette? 

Russian roulette played revolver one bullet meaning there's 1/6th (16.67%) chance dying. COVID's fatality rate 0.25%.

The Russian roulette analogy one stupid ones. virus course real need spread panic misinformation.

People like dangerous mental health susceptible. Prior covid already I've felt. Raising children reason life know death inevitable. try minimize impact others tho Honest question anyone knows; happens parents/families refuse let go school? 

I live area &amp; schools opening near me. However, even did, way would sending kids school. Yup you’re allowed literally lock restriction put place. state said can’t leave hone last six months. issue put people risk, whole point. go without mask, you’re endangering Americans lives. understand risk small. 

Beaches opened people started violating rules place put lives risk. state, NY, beaches open state response citizens follow safety measures contained virus. They’ve open month. 

The reason beaches closed places, like hone state Michigan, people started violating safety measures implemented, spreading virus put general populations lives risk. 

These measures put place you, sounds like responsible care common good, even personally responsible, ten assholes think it’s giant conspiracy right endanger lives friends, families neighbors ruin everyone.

Aaron Hernandez’ CTE certainly well-advanced college years. estimate discrepancy first noticed around 4000. three weeks since probably closer 5000. see comment getting downvoted. I'm sure I'm stating fact deaths calculated. believe country way including UK nations. second doubt UK deaths extremely high. excess deaths show that. However, flawed methodology means daily reported deaths extremely inaccurate. helpful numerous reasons. No, odds won’t. Even seniors isn’t death sentence, high chance beating it.

If going relativist morals, aren’t really position criticizing Americans stupid. hear you. live Maine filled tourists country, including hotspot areas. supposed quarantine negative test, tests picture time. Obviously, get infected right test. 

Hardly anyone wearing mask. People figure Maine super safe since never many cases deaths. Schools going opening restrictions. imagine may lurking population now. Going vacation last thing mind right now. Remember Fauci said masks were’t necessary?

Remember govenor NY sent patients nursing homes? people infectious without realizing it, begin show symptoms? least, that's heard seven months ago... appreciate enthusiasm (read: annoyingly juvenile patronization), telling basic things already know. explaining guy making simplistic comparison add context number deaths WW2 vs. now.

We get decide rules game. hand dealt, play it.

I looked post history seem like awareness first shitty bill similar shitty EO. Weird. lol mind. Kudos people wearing masks call going gives going Yeah, think need make sure there's granularity question. Vaccine Oxford? Sign fuck up. Vaccine company Trump stock best vaccine, greatest vaccine ever? I'll wait couple weeks see people start developing ass teeth. going gives going ballpark 10% positive, bad. 

for context though that's 40 something per 100k, roughly 1/5th testing tennessee 1/2 testing arizona right now.

one problem though, bbc reports regards type test used : ""But one independently evaluated ICMR Indian Institute Medical Sciences (AIIMS), found accuracy giving true negative result ranged 50% 84%.  "" They're astonished now? wait December.

  tested Friday, lab reported getting sample 3 days, got results following Saturday.  knows actual valid sample point. understand, still shpuldnt 3x made even close true. fact, you’re multiples.

The models making predictions bad inputs. 3.5 months go quite frankly aren’t enough active COVID cases support 300k December. would astronomical increase spread, timeline symptom onset death, halting every single current downward trend currently don’t ignore herd immunity still get million.

Assuming Covid 50% HIT (which almost double estimated) IFR 0.65% (which high estimate based March April’s high deaths didn’t good grasp treat virus) get 1,072,500 dead. one numbers better (both be) don’t reach 1 million. Trump going get another 500bil slush fund? courtesy Aaron Hernandez well acquainted CTE cost them. Unrelated course CoV except team seen invisible injury (or thousand little ones) cost guy. Now, Red Sox player benched Covid-related complication. blame one bit. Trump violated lot laws. weird violation determines dictatorship genocidal policy family separation.

You fucked morality. That's probably true would also half millions deaths.  one deflected wars America involved in. 90% population lives south latitude line 100 miles north Montana. 20 cases northern half Canada Yukon Northwest territories, flat avoiding it. northeastern Canada? Nunavut either (sorry). Yep, welcome inverted totalitarianism. Yea, ""hoax"" generally means ""fake"" not? saying death numbers faked. wasn't. completely agree kicked off. knew would interpreted way downvoted posted that. Actually posted though point maybe something missed original comment. odd thing reddit mentality general. 
My point taxpayer always gets fucked need set federal justice buildings fire they're fucking joke healthcare free people barely afford shelter. answer titles question: us do, others follow their... leaders... America worst, bottom 25% sure. countries handling poorly many better job. we're projecting almost 300K deaths we're opening schools. God bless America. That's I've do. district barely get enough cleaning supplies, buy see them. Lol. No, isn't. That's opinion. try think things another perspective good minute two? try grasp idea every culture shares American ideals. I'm blaming parties parties responsible.

Are not?  IIRC I've seen studies said cotton masks need multiple layers.

I think mask making sub, might look there. I'm Iowa too. I'm still grocery pickup. Although one time I've gone (last week), see anyone without mask. Unfortunately, person makes point every one idiots clutches flag chests, starts shouting ""MERICA!"", basically attack vapors. think vaccines fail annual triannual boosters maintain antibodies may required. no, said ""more people die every year common flu died war."" OP talking American deaths. According words typed, clarify American deaths, inferred talking global deaths. gonna talk global flu deaths, gotta compare global WWII deaths. 250k-500k annual flu deaths compared 70M-80M WWII deaths. 

If talking US flu deaths, number around 20k-60k. Number Americans died WWII around 300k, Coronavirus deaths currently sitting 165k lot coming. wrong counts.

Again, *you* forget simple fucking math? every class? teach middle school well, told sanitize classroom per day LOL. rumor state/district barely get enough cleaning supplies manage daily cleanings. I've stocking cleaning supplies classroom see them. They'll still consider ""something Lord wanted get."" So, reality, it'll get better die longer harm anyone else. say skipping steps, said skipping normal protocols. Normal time scales accelerated. want talk actually skipping steps look Russia.

I mentioned scenario vaccine tomorrow gave simple time frame. makes comfortable add 6 months it’s available length time effects known for.

Why don’t care much potential long term complications vaccine? confident everything fine even hesitant absurd?

Let’s face worldwide governments moment desperate get economies going l, proud owner deployable vaccine international points. 
Assuming vaccine works, people value vaccine dependent probability surviving vaccine without side affects Vs chance surviving virus without side effects.

By way someone chosen every free vaccine NHS. engineer masters degree. looked vaccines comfortable taking one. don’t take information Facebook, actually look deeper use critical thinking evidence reach conclusion. conclusion receiving vaccine. 

As new information constantly produced comfortable changing opinion something change outlook. welcome provide sources rebut claims Well, there's full-proof cure it?

You must mentally challenged lol Great choice. Seems appropriate. deliberately obtuse. 

That second ironically, least using Morissette definition, self-aware statement made, mention cheap out.

I think problem took offense first comment lashed out, rather taking moment try understand point making. And, anger impaired ability rational discussion consecutive reply, evidenced personal/aggressive needle add comment.

You really turn little bit anger inwards, rather lashing assuming everything personal attack MASKS.

Thanks, seriously...unless, course, creating untested design, case switch one common cloth mask designs, stop making masks. 95% literally literally money bud!  happened English scientists outside CEBM? Sunetra Gupta claimed pretty recently IFR covid England's all-population mortality due covid! Kind strange see voice repesenting expert opinion press counterweight. Funeral homes crematoriums making bank, hospitals make anything dealing huge numbers COVID patients compared lucrative elective procedures, know get information from. Im litterally opposite end political spectrum would never vote SD. Covid hasnt changed that.

 Sure maybe genocide bit harsh shitton people died unneccesarly.

Politically dont understand Swedish left taken completley different path rest world. New Straits Times. represent oligarchy.  Yes subdep worked really really hard it. model made death close one. Biden can't answer either. dude full blown dementia. It’s probably percent actually getting tested too. Also, tests aren’t easy come by(at least weren’t first months coronavirus) aren’t reliable, really think US vaccine readily available ? Yeah, works country actually cares citizens.

How people supposed stay home way survive next week go work, get paycheck, use paycheck buy groceries, hope landlord fine less full rent.

Everyone reduced hours workers, they’re earning less, don’t money.

And trump wants force states magically invent new program give us $300, plus $100 states already don’t money give us extra $100 first place??? GET $300 extra state give us $100 extra???

It’s insane. Teachers, including myself, brought superintendent via school committee meets times year discuss pressing concerns. response district intention testing staff students return in- person due widespread availability testing.

Teachers returned Monday I’ve personally around two principals chose consistently wear masks. morning sudden onset gastrointestinal symptoms may may related COVID, learned nearest place get tested 30 miles away. ...70-80 Million people dies WWII. 250,000 - 500,000 people die flu annually. 

Did forget simple math? Well, given pretty much job POTUS lead nation, yeah. SOMETHING COULD DO. asleep read stated?  Thank kind words support. Insane states OK others not—in later seems die court. care, severely misinformed. Much credit absolute idiotic precident. They're weird. really push Biden hard real dual nature pandemic America. feels like everything still going usual many ways. still go drive thru get meal, go outside park nature preserve, many us still go work. threat COVID, bankruptcy us individuals companies/employers, true civil, political unrest weave together make invisible pall draping every moment every day. fair comparison either compare Spanish Flu considering done century Covid-19 still *ongoing* far over. ‘ really doesn’t’, understatement. fight ? Part thinks, yes principle. since us see left run course, says nothing accomplish nothing. Especially 85 days left. imo.

Another tedious af PR stunt useless incompetent administration. got. It’s actually pretty viscous. Cruelty point shit show, believe, say. yea, go coronavirus challenge, lick toilet seats ever see one even hit national mourning. disgusting. no, really can't. nationalistic attitudes cancerous bred ignorance misinformation.

Russia went war country betrayed them, helping grow. that's them. nationalistic pride purely subjugating countries, feeling bitter unable so, despite large area map. 

It's almost like feel land ownership directly tied representation among global stage, rather economy offer countries. hateful pretend like they're still superpower. corrupt government stealing wealth using improve image leader country uses portion attack countries/seize previously 'owned' territory (like Crimea region Ukraine). people care grift he's encouraging nationalistic attitude; breeeding ignorance/hatred/nationalism poverty. consistency criteria reporting, (infected persons dying gunshot wound car accident counted Covid death happening multiple states) post misinformation?

&amp;#x200B;

Infected deaths present symptoms also going unreported though Covid may exacerbated existing condition. data unreliable. projections make great headlines bad data bad science. much. print much money devaluation dollar starts, inflation sets in. portion american population werent gaggle jerk-offs, actually abided guidelines would much better shape. government shit show people guilty. opinion. definitely see point. God looks nice there. anywhere looks nice compared living Phoenix 110+ degree weather perpetuity. story article take place US. created temporary UBI like Andrew Yang suggested, instead passing bill every months, bunch pork inserted bill. Also, direct payments people, need most. Instead trillions going business, funding new lambos (it actually happened) payroll tax cut benefit people, game guessing business going pass payroll tax savings employee? Although part issue deaths US arent slowing down.

At current rate US may well least overtake Italy Sweden. feel like everything canceled good reason all. Yeah understand lot mistrust guided emotion, also hard ignore fact nothing like ever happened recent history.
  
When time comes say, Dr. Fauci come say take vaccine, probably trust him. somebody close relation Trump, would definitely skeptical. 
  
It also help many times CDC told Americans one thing, reneged statement. why, like say, absolutely zero room error vaccine today's political social climate.
  
I really know, time comes, collectively come together solve pandemic. current divisive nature politics America (and world) makes ever difficult. Let try:

A lack atrophy critical thinking skills lifetime led susceptibility sources like FN, mastered art manipulating emotions via right tone imagery knowledge dig deeper headline anger outrage cathartic fucked way.

Put media sources blender, make louder, fast forward, run mixture bunch static shit like QA, preys already fragile mental health people like (fragile country historically treated mental health like bad joke).

So people filled brim rage fear world changing around them, often better. lack ability emotionally regulate means can't process fears internally consciously, instead project world, lack critical thinking ability also leads disinterest seeking truth even verifiable fact, preferring stop easiest step makes feel better - scapegoating common theme throughout human history. feel like day there’s new poll says different amount people willing get vaccinated, feel like it’s hard tell many people actually get vaccinated. think hesitation though No, used parasite infection. 

It damages central nervous system invertebrates, mostly vertebrates. central nerves protected protein pump prevents entering. Certain breeds dogs missing gene mutation invermectin harms/kills dog breeds.

Used Africa humans treats river blindness, disease parasitic infection time causes blindness. Also used cream treat scabies. Thank faith &amp; trust! Anything soak holy water earth fire!  Nobody answer that, unfortunately I'd definitely report that. Perhaps 311 Alberta. show got data Japan? 

The source BI used article I’m you’re relying but, kinda. It’s way parents learn take seriously. kind parents anyway? kid even 1% chance getting school wouldn’t go. number one issue hvac air flow rooms. needs solved worrying sanitization procedure. hard cleaners wipe surfaces people commonly touch room. need device unless cheaper extra people cleaning. Well, vaccines kill you. really, really rare. Reminds old Bush moment. woman telling story works multiple jobs worried economy, wants make sure family eat.

There 2 ways look story.

""Damn, need work hard make sure family eat?""

Or Bush way ""Wow, work 2 jobs? Uniquely American it.""

He saw ""good work ethic"".

Sacrifice health job (like nurse story)? Good work ethic! I’m sure whatever won’t enough locals die nonsense.

It’s incredibly sad. point been? country effectively controlled virus pretty much stayed number.  change subject like think best thing say ""You're right, pedophiles problem too. Let's conversation another time. Right we're talking Covid masks.""

Don't let distract unrelated nonsense. Make stay subject. 
The death toll WWII estimated around 70 million people, 291,557 US casualties cited represent rather small fraction that, 0.42% specific.

Yes, take history Way miss point, yet still get angry somebody puts US casualties context massive total loss lifes WWII resulted in.

Not angry, calling ""mistweet"" that's quite representative lot Americans education mindset WWII, regularly actually rather dismissive total scale particularly sacrifices made Eastern Europeans end it.

I like *just* posted article detailing dismissiveness French regards Eastern Front, go single Americans. almost like there's ignorance everywhere, focusing one 
I mean look whole interaction: merely pointed US casualties small fraction total loss lives WWII, absolutely factual, trying kind argument that's supposedly ""dismissive"".

Because obviously dismissive. particular thread US action WWII. Someone said US get 1943, patently wrong. decided call Americans died battles ""only drop bucket"".

If can't see that's dismissive, can't help you. guess main problem vaccine simply work. approve severe effects show up.

The ""might work"" would make like flu vaccine get every year. Oh there's ways... Last read arrive Poland flight UK able enter problem. schengen.

So basically us-uk-poland Boomers ones mostly dying, talking about? facts please.  We're 7mo this, 160k+ right?  see deaths single figure last year say “See?? COVID even DEADLIER thought”. Nope, doesn’t work way. They’ve moved next talking points, ones see lot are: (1) people aren’t going put another shutdown, (2) economy can’t withstand everyone going back normal, (3) doesn’t matter it’s old, sick, people preexisting conditions die, (4) hydroxychloroquine miracle treatment proven demon semen Dr. anecdotes Dr.’s disease experts around world lying undermine Trump, (4) kids don’t get sick need back schools order force everyone back work. Hey guys! video wedding 🙃it would nice subscribe YouTube channel well☺️ thank much! Rants nothing .... I'll brave set really cool tool. Interesting see data across US different gathering sizes Nobody's enforcing quarantine, know time, hey made rules that's us. smugness protects Coronavirus problem, otherwise maybe big problem. subreddit fucking joke. literally cite articles March April show exactly thinking shut everything down, people choose upvote blatant lies. everyone case amnesia? 2020: hold beer.

Arizona continues see drops cases, hospitalizations, deaths testing remains around 7500 day. 

Arizona one lowest Rt values country 

Data yesterday:

Here's updated chart new AZ COVID cases last months (with today's data): LINK
Cases: 7-day avg continues fall. track for: 200K cases August 20, 5,000 deaths August 25.
Testing: Big drop tests, demand likely falling. 54K tests shy 60K. (22 days left ""Project Catapult"" supposedly pushes 60K capacity.)
Spread: Overall PCR positive test percentage dropped stayed 14.1% (based 1.021M tests, 6.6% low) average week stayed 9% (based 37K tests, previous week revised 11% 10%).
Hospital Utilization: COVID Hospitalizations dropped 2%. ICU beds COVID patients dropped 10%. (Overall ICU bed usage 83%). Ventilators use COVID dropped 7%. Intubations Respiratory Distress stayed triple digits (55).
Data Source: ADHS cousin attends one local churches. wear face mask. it’s optional parishioners. asked many wear masks said less half parishioners do. also said one wears one church transportation bus. One family attends sick covid-19 said asked prayers. called last night asked would going church morning said yes. little taken aback since already one family congregation ill. gave explanation God knows doing. US one country. Europe least lot better knowledge world affairs world geography, US crazy sucks at. may care much one single individual country, they. idea ~50 whole countries Europe would care much geography history one single country ridiculous. huge motorcycle event Fayetteville, Arkansas every year called Bikes, Blues, BBQ luckily city foresight cancel event. restaurant Fayetteville business perspective sucks canceled brings ton money, I'd rather suffer financially little bit thousands inevitably unmasked bikers funnel bar course days! assuming Why? wear mask I'm public, bar/club public event 20 people since march. 

I want know take over. dont know much individual do.  want Europeans know Americans stupid. Alot are, all. many us taking seriously, we're undermined powerful political interests. believe allow walk bikes/motorcycles, don't. check testing location. wish, Great Plains it’s maybe 20%. It’s gotten closer 50/50 Walmart mandated mask wearing go store it’s 15-20%. Got city parks it’s zero. Tennessee story, left May around 20% may highballing vaccine made available TODAY would take it. Even week now. month.

There time test thoroughly. body, forever.

Most people going inject ingest something new. Regardless examples past vaccines explaining trials average, rational person still probably going decline option.

It depends fear more: virus infection possible problematic virus vaccine.

It comes fear. You’re absolutely correct rural communities mask wearing. feels hostile walk around one on. 

Going grocery store (which done handful times since March) last night eye opening uncomfortable. Masks offered door, see people walking around without one frustrating. [Ain't got job ain't got shit 14 days mostly meant people reason stay long term, vacationers vaccines born get like 2 something like could go college dorms. I’ve never even flu shot I’ve flu one time life. I’ll probably skip one too. I’ve coworkers get flu shot still get sick. think last time cold early 20s I’m 31 now. r/NotTheOnion That's virus free sustainable. borders still open returning citizens/residents couple working exemptions like film crews; obviously opens us risk reinfection even mandatory quarantine. also likely afford keep border closed vaccine ready. 

There's good chance corona virus get despite precautions. introduce people concept masks now, it'll lot easier contain spread happens. Technically that’s Florida for. almost like knew nothing virus initially speculated mitigation tactics, continually revised got new data testing. 

Were entirely asleep science class covered *fucking scientific process*? could guessed tv celebrity zero government experience, 6 bankruptcies, 5 kids 3 different marriages, 4 college deferments, 22 charges sexual assault, could bad President?

xpost youtube Exactly. MSM would job actually informing people, instead siding this, perhaps could exposed political theatre is. Yes, know person research but... R0 close 1 America dropping. numbers manipulated. fact. I'm sure looking Resorting calling names changes nothing, shows weakness fear. Best luck that. countries going dishonest it. Plus company making can't dishonest open HUGE liabilities.

This case best business interest completely forthcoming results. y

I see owners 100% problem look far find it... 80% Canada lives within one hour US Yea mean North Korean Kim’s Great Leader kids studied Switzerland everyone else locked North Korea. show got data Japan? slightly oecd average much higher us 🤣🤣🤣 Odd remember 2.2M, 60,000. 60,000 would literally comparable ordinary flu season. started informative sub turned hysteria. bulk voters posters lost plot month ago, place dumpster fire misinformation America hating. one cares facts data more. want dispense unsupported ideas virus works great farts smell. nothing unproductive circlejerk now.

&amp;#x200B;

Any information developments undermine agenda downvoted reinterpreted absolutely silly ways. can't handle truth, barely hang onto concepts know situation fluid is. pathetic. Grow up, stop thinking know everything. course ain't easy. one said is. still better , dunno , literally fucking losing life clue vaccines developed normally. know current situation normal huge amount pressure pharmaceutical companies roll vaccines asap. health related, also economical company getting first vaccine going get huge profits. 
And yes, makes second thoughts wanting get soon becomes available. also none risk groups feel fairly comfortable self isolation. People rolled dice health even knew COVID many ways. vast majority people recover disease, make sense would cause new normal, except short term.

But again, argued whether even called new normal case. Well, completely besides point. Wearing hats general meant two things. Protecting head weather rain. It’s disrespectful wearing means don’t trust host person owning building protect find unsafe around. 

That said think gonna enforce something petty school anything limiting spread potentially deadly virus says lot. Hard keep line poster boy Dump. (Usually get annoyed goofy names don’t want run afoul ridiculous automod.) 70k protests year. stupid enough protesting masks. culling IQ. order 100,000 people dead need be. Lots lots people blame many listening people supposed leaders.

And yes, many people careful get it, spread anyway, need bad focus economy May April killing economy today. Remindme! 3 months  really; legal abortion incredibly safe nowadays, death rate really low! Yeeeaah... spent minutes listening YouTube. can't say worst thing I've ever heard say there's way I'd risk getting Corona watch them.

Obesity *both* choice *and* symptom larger socio-economic cultural issues. Certainly, obesity rates US caused financial difficulty obtaining healthy foods. instance, [this showed richest men (those whose incomes 350% federal poverty line) obese poorest men (those whose incomes less 130% federal line). Moreover, obesity rates lowest poor countries, [Vietnam way reacted virus really changed opinion country whole. Im talking government response, mean people.

I've always known politicians every stripe bunch corrupt bastards, much surprise.

But pandemic clearly exposed average every day American Joe arrogant, self absorbed, selfish piece shit. always though ""those people"" minority, true.

Really disgusted homeland point. 1) burden proof person makes claim. butt hurt it. 

2) said, gone beyond anything I've expected web debate. I'll actually take time read links today. gave thumbs up. 

3) far I've read first three articles. one links peer reviewed study. study done April concluded research needed, find nice bit info.... remember we're dealing coronavirus, influenza. Taken nature.com article linked. actually supports use face masks prevent spread Coronavirus. detected coronavirus respiratory droplets aerosols 3 10 (30%) 4 10 (40%) samples collected without face masks, respectively, detect virus respiratory droplets aerosols collected participants wearing face masks, difference significant aerosols showed trend toward reduced detection respiratory droplets also demonstrated efficacy surgical masks reduce coronavirus detection viral copies large respiratory droplets aerosols (Table 1b). important implications control COVID-19, suggesting surgical face masks could used ill people reduce onward transmission. even realize they're anymore sell sides truth depending need moment. Packed halls 9 cases impossible makes seem like 99% students asymptomatic. infected student would come contact 9 people. many total students school. 1k+ isnt amazing news 9 kids got covid-19? hundreds 9 people could easily got covid outside school too. 

The girl posted pic another Greta thornberry. looks talks aspergers. fox news mentioned trying disrupt school ways social media initially got suspended posting pic. Apparently also choice words w/the pic. Yeah, I'd probably counted 58%. want immediately I'm it. There's probably gonna limited supply anyway, rushed humanly possible, I'm happy wait months let everyone else test subjects.

If there's unforeseen side effects consequences, produced quickly administered effectively, cheap, that's great. Fantastic. Sign up.

But I'm gonna first one line. canada. Overall put institutions risk. Released non violent offenders average recidivism rate 58% 3 weeks. Almost back 90 days brought virus. cases 4 months, started getting inmates back released brought virus in.

Unfortunately people isolated imprisoned likely take rules pandemic seriously. 

There also cases releasing offenders deadly consequences. ""non violent sex offender"" released, ended raping girl knifepoint. Unfortunately easy simple people suggest. No, didn't. That's called out. idea getting Prime definition aside. WW2 victims 2-4 times younger covid victims are. Dr. Fauci mid-July: think I've seen source suggesting immunity period days. People suggesting multiple months, minimum. hate freedom cable television. No, anybody diagnosed COVID later dies, even recovered COVID, listed COVID death. COVID, three months later die car accident 'COVID death'. Try crazy approach actually reading article, fun. might best place, honestly. cull going happen US. Hopefully mostly confederate flag/prosperity bible sorts. move novel non-novel

With diseases crossing humans animals rise, may need rethink novel means. claim understand virus 3 decades study, that's 3 decades late don’t think principal gets decide close school, generally. would assume orders came higher. pretty well established everything outlined part GOP play book begin with. They'd exact thing without Russia's assistance. absolutely be. school board citing stuff Europe ignoring anything inconvenient. guarantee look Georgia see happening there, look Scandinavia say, ""Well, clear!"" good studies articles children young second grade still spread virus? Insufferable. Hanlon's razor applies here, albeit slightly modified. one symptoms covid loss taste. makes sense Ignorance bliss. envy you. What's way picking leader, voting? Taiwan, mic drop. Either way stupid Interesting. seems they've used wording would allow emergency use. conditions basically known benefit outweigh known possibility harm. wording clear, seem speculate could mean approving trial data collected, full analysis complete. guess kinda splitting hairs, me, they're still running vaccine 3 phases clinical trials, they're basically skipping last steps, peer review publication. There's also indication they're likely this, they've included possibility framework approval.

I dunno. guess I'll say right. understand. think important stop saying things like 'get sick die'. statistically, one things likely happen. 

Someone could read think 'Ah, one thousand chance I'd die, I'll take odds'. need remind problem worry that.

That said, even risk getting sniffle see butt rock bullshit It’s definitely stoppable ones gonna try stop  argument american cavalier behavior exceptionalism fundamental core identity type behavior considered illogical therefore, dumb. somesuch. 

Were also clearly easily turned one another. Despite well educated populace we're pretty easily indoctrinated fooled taking risks believing idiocy. could make argument, wrong doubt 90% people ever read anything past headline post. read go shoot mouths thread. dont symptomes people around neither every human world safe like me... Yeah sure... dont know single person got cancer. Cancer existing bad? Ur idiot Nah... NYC Covid-19 deaths less 15% U.S. deaths Covid-19 far.

So lower 20% 65 across U.S. 1-in-60 people tested positive never met someone who's gotten it, live tri-state. got shit together fast still mandate masks everywhere, almost non-existent area now. Weird states shit together states falling apart. government oversaw state governments, could something nationally... pandemic specifically sure shits would happen president term fuck up. union ruins business business business. Correlation =/= causation. Yes people died COVID probably part due said before. numerous factors addition illness contribute however, needs empirical confirmation distinguishing causing jumping conclusions, even seem obvious. Thats right. Make statement, reply got told. school offering online in-person learning, think I'll online learning. see virus going away maybe sometime 2021. Carbon Dioxide Go on.  Please seek professional help. America: ""Hold beer!"" can't find single source states virus airborne, instead say airborne vector aersolized droplets. article JHU backs up. risk health citizens somebody else's pride....what ally vaults experiments, I’m sure people played fallout know that. morbid fascination watching Georgia’s decision making right now. care aren’t great enough country anything it. Sad really. 15k people going tease insanely rare side effect.

If there's long term side effect, another 100M people 3-6 months irrelevant. He's homeless, he's less person eyes. article posted recently sub regarding claim. lot doctors nurses came onto post saying it’s true story. One said girlfriend Nurse, came home balling eyes delivered 2 3 stillbirths day, normally may deliver one month. research conducted far I’m aware. Shaun Dead comes true. issues it, even slight soreness! TB test gives bruise, though.  amazing one reads actual University experts revealed significant proportion daily out-of-hospital death toll England related patients recovered virus weeks months earlier
The system meant even people died accidents counted towards coronavirus toll previously tested positive""

So hospital leave fully recovered die unrelated circumstance still counted covid death. school closed minimum two days. think world awaiting american people show cannot stand behind president acting like does.. Less 100 days.. lets see happens then... Let’s forget California higher population Canada border control...not mention multiple densely populated cities. 45% Americans could vote didn't. vote, 45% voted reality show character president. silent, majority Americans idiots, nothing say make take seriously reactions it, thing evident day day lives covid reaction contain it. time gives ray hope, it? USA way protect misinformation way important topic.  post day poll said almost Americans would get vaccine? stupid waste everything. Good know long time effects.. /s Exactly! ounce prevention... It’s summer lot countries virus still spreading even stated one big wave, possible reason, although unlikely could herd immunity although think it’s lockdown effect still coming despite deaths rising cases still increasing deaths lag effect. Even go despite reopenings apart gym shops that’s also antibodies disappear fast may suggest people can’t detected antibody studies  Here's article publication source, citing luminaries Bioethicist Art Caplan New York University School Medicine, written politicizing lockdowns, explains Trump, federal level, mismanage outbreak. 

It goes detail national, international diplomatic response kill people, importantly love misinformation botch recovery. 

It's article Atlantic, therefore expect completely drop old misinformed ((** eye---roll  **)) opinion, adopt opinion, accept full truth.

That's articles Atlantic work, right? provided source, MUST accept work freaking covid lab full protective gear, STILL someone (no longer there) covid. People going even masks still baffles completely, despite behavior actually normal now. family goes eat like every day, goes beach, etc. extremely frustrating. vaccine take 

causes response immune system. Oh bad antigens happen resemble ...
a receptor liver ...
or heart muscle.

This rushed vaccine Trump, wait family get first doses.
When shown safe, I'll get it, yearly vaccine based old inert virus already taken 10 times 10 vaccines.

No, old virus, different genetic changes slightly different structure, epitopes, thus new vaccine required.  can't inject random antigens say ""Don't worry, hurt you"". still clinging old data skew first wave spring, keeping number high looking. even 85 one point. ~78, still falling, continue fall.

One really obvious indicator look states recently dealing this, means initial spike retirement communities unaware mitigated.

Many states hotspots virus surged recently deaths among older adults may lagging, including Alabama (where 76% COVID-19 deaths among 65 older), Tennessee (76%), Nevada (75%), Arizona (74%), Mississippi (74%), Arkansas (71%), New Mexico (71%), Texas (70%).

And trend continuing, really obvious reasons. argument Americans stupid faultyinfantry tactics war ended 100 yrs ago? Huh? still need extremely vigilant, testing infrastructure + contact tracing place. Places could WFH continue so, adopt hybrid model people come twice week. state visitors tested case. sister decided go beach friends. mother high blood pressure lupus need dialysis. type people give shit. also American. virus exposed us ""The greatest country earth"" (so many Americans think anyway) selfish, many give flying fuck community. conspiracy theories, misinformation, selfishness ignorance staggering. divided, time desperately need come together. argument valid far today.

But layoff packages end. People Europe work sooner later. Socialist health care perpetual. ends state runs money.

If vasts loans EU provided multiple states would bankrupted now. point, differences US EU inexistent. would love see math behind that! I'm also convinced seeing 2-3 times less actually Dr. Tam needs change messaging wants people adhere it. 

If take group 20-39 year olds, current (Ontario) mortality rate 0.1% try tell 50% vaccine STILL socially distance wear masks ... 2-3 YEARS? lost attention many age range. 

She needs better job different messaging different age groups. See CBC opinion piece Dr. Kettner week. See link below. kind, much. interesting! Thanks follow up. Mark words: months media change narrative. 

""Trump trying poison rushed COVID vaccine""

""Read potentially harmful side effects Trump's rushed COVID vaccine""

""The rushed COVID vaccine might kill loved ones""

""Grandma dies taking rushed COVID vaccine!""

It never truth. never was. always clicks. could start health insurance co-op. true. mean misrepresent activities dangerous, point *at least* degrees normalcy remain, blunts puncture COVID's protein spike daily lives. Well unofficial mantra Republican party ""fuck got mine"", surprised happened. America's golden years far behind us now. Hey now, I'm healthy weight, diabetic, I'm side this. us like friend. Try  Cant sugar coat level fail though American, (and others) hope return Ireland soon, right time..   


My wife look forward returning safe so. reach herd immunity something? income high lol, income high mean poor. live paycheck paycheck can't save--i qualify Medicaid  Tibet independent, part western China probably gov't Uighurs, Hong Kong independent, idk anywhere else it. Agreed. it’s droplet spatter first kid sneeze doorknob railing day one start new chain. it’s aerosol (more evidence time) cleaning place won’t make difference little Johnny covid case breaths teachers friends. 

Theatre great word it. Awesome Trevor Lawrence #1 player football right #1 pick. Keep mind, *"" Masks required school, Mr. Otott said, though administration strongly encourages students staff members. ""*

 

This going keep going. recent 7 day average 198, yeah pretty close record lows.

Not saying Sweden amazing, resurgence, Denmark’s cases doubled 60 140. US wearing masks are. mitigation methods think US *isn't* using are? Likely?! could.

Do know know could? article addresses that, super basic suggestion anyone researching deaths would think about.

The article step that, one makes argument (and numerous thread) actually read article. forgot type “maga” caps end. OP comments political. sub? fair, one first governors order lockdown back March taken thing pretty seriously Put shut up. cannot lie, refuse provide evidence, claim I’m one putting head sand. Enjoy spreading disinformation, you’re one people last word, please do, I’ll reading it’s credible journalism documentation lie. You’d surprised many untrue things become common knowledge people living bubble lies. you. really. Vietnam also went 100 days without community transmission case discovered Da Nang, likely Chinese caught crossing border, it’s hundreds. Illegal border crossings difficult stop NZ, like island nations, big advantage. makes perfect sense think guys start flocking north stay-at-home order lifted? lot trouble understanding someone works healthcare, education requires, could blind virus. testing sites closed hurricane. well like picked high low end arguably far misleading, got average fair enough Maga Unfortunately us may suffer consequences, say ""see? bad! vaccine I'm perfectly fine!"" article mention that.

It also mention 50,000 deaths can't attributed those.

Almost like people researching deaths know super basic argument.  cool, guess it'll easier get vaccine  curiosity, come across studies using stimulants (adderall, Ritalin, etc.) cure symptoms COVID-19? briefly looked google, see anything, guess make sense since they're controlled substances. 

Brain fog, difficulty concentrating, issues short-term memory people Inattentive ADHD (or ADD) experience, I'm interested see would make difference people symptoms due COVID. could possibly given idea? interesting watch unfold. Hopefully failures South least provide data rest country use forming sensible school plan. Well realizing ""they"" killed grandma. care hits close home. know data talking about? link something? Henry Ford Hydroxychloroquine study specifically found flawed study.

The study found use randomized methods individuals given Hydroxychloroquine also likely given steriods.

It’s true blind study obtain true outcome.

Also, yes, correct paper peer reviewed yet. Given COVIDs ability affect nervous system, including smell taste, highly likely real possibility. Hahaha. Let guess, bill gates wants microchip you. Well yeah, course. else spin numbers everyone else manages contain it. I've said I'll say again:

Freedom killed football. That's science functions.

""...but, but, found 1 5 100""

You found 20. God damn Jericho, I've liked/looked guy years present day always followed closely - thought smarter this. ayatollah spread corona (not denied)

enjoy borscht I'm surprised Anti-Mask League restarted yet. You’re displaying exactly sort malicious simplistic thinking totally degenerated political discourse. It’s absurd way conceptualise entire country many vastly differing views. 

We don’t know question worded. It’s also worth noting actually younger people likely skeptical vaccine. Given lean left much greater degree older people seems unlikely happening reasons want be. headline seems little bearing actual numbers within article anyway (many absent, despite absolutely critical meaningfully interpret results) guess none matters you. Politicians suppose heros. suppose best job possible make country run keep going. closely packed highly populated area job best could. Likely, grass pollen levels pretty high area think embarrassing people still change minds given facts tbh. need accurate data else pretty much useless. ""Deep cleaning"" prevent covid like wearing N95 make sure get AIDS. Democrats symptom rot republican party? fail understand point trying make bothsiderism. Studies long-term side effects.  Look Thalidomide babies Pandemrix side-effects narcolepsy.  insufficient testing. Yep. shows Europe taking seriously consider Greece's situation alarming, rightly so. Highest number infected planet. 5000000. Highest number new cases per day. 2477. Highest number deaths 160000+, probably greater 200000 believe CDC data. Highest number daily deaths. 1100. r/NegativeWithGold countries test 10 million people finding 10 cases city 10 million.

Some countries send kids back school 100 babies test positive 1 died single town 300k.

Which country think care human rights? lol Something like 2.6 million Americans die every year. understand everybody clutching pearls million more. let nature take course instead destroying economy trampling people's freedoms. South Korea New Zealand already done one said anything eradication. It’s suppressing point stamping small outbreaks Stupid thing say, course I'd believe actually showed proof. believe without seeing evidence. ""And I'll believe moon landings happened release *real* footage"" genuinely curious are. New Zealand strong level control covid currently. seem like likely place in-door schooling happening.

And need google unsuccessful attempts. norm Reddit. Over/under long next security guard gets shot? key context clue mowing lawn.

Mowing lawn causes respiratory symptoms people grass allergies. Masks theory block particles. Lol Idk tell man statement end almost word word CDC director Robert Redfield said, feel like knows he's talking Masks make difference feel like Americans putting much confidence them. Europe got virus control without people really wearing masks. Social distancing far far effective. seems weird everyone talks masks staying away people big thing yous push response district intention testing staff students return in-person

Wow, weaselly bunch bullshit. didn’t want require testing plausible deniability—if required it, wouldn’t able say “we didn’t know!” everything blows up. 

Sending good vibes. Make sure stay hydrated keep electrolytes up. Sudden GI problems fuck up.  I'm prejudiced, opinions Americans based fact reason! 


I could give flying fuck vacation much money spend here. really think need you, specifically? many people want move here, ridiculous. irony there's nothing special Americans except go bankrupt keeping alive. save trouble stay home, thousands miles away. Keep business leisurely pursuits, right important things dollars. Like Canada retaining things make place want come first place. ASIAN COUNTRIES tested us. don’t need fucking experiment see WORKED. Holy shit... blind ignorant people?

The Netherlands' government wont enforce masks experts concluded maks dont actually slow spread.

Are experts Netherlands morons? went dollar tree twice pandemic. time walked in, saw line like 50 deep, walked out. rule simple, think enforcement would simple never dollar tree. exactly would happen. point insanity safest course let Trump continue mismanage moderates vote component leadership November. 

Latest estimates 300,000 dead December. Continuing current course means reality. isn’t worst case scenario. Trump team win November expect number triple. Dems going offensive effectively allowing 130,000 Americans die without fight save 600,000. Ok dipshit. .. police? else lol seems really weird right wing talking point right now. I've multiple conversations conservative father says YEAH GETTING RID PEDOPHILES. everyone 3 weeks food, bread, milk, medicine etc sitting there, money get it. would allow local food shopping needed, collecting medicine, seeing doctor, essential working. socialising. mixing. Churches etc online only. individual local exercise. Seem mostly rural areas. Go figure.... Masks slow down. parts CA masks mandates least 3 months.

Japan universal making cases rising now.

It slows momentum infection soon takes it. Well yes, said agreed nursing homes boosted number initially. 78 average age death two months think actual number. Give take points course.

And well young people percent almost extremely obese. fat older person, sure virus scary person take upon avoid risk. shouldnt changing society high risk group. help mitigate risks like baseball handrails do? course dont disagree all. care stores enforce masks.

But agree shutting businesses locking down. Let people make decisions. Open country I've gotten quite comments it. necessarily complaints, like condescending comments. One guy laughed said must librul. friends 30 year old bird articulate Trump. legit conversations him. absolutely real threat. People extended family contracted it’s terrible them. friend’s step father died complicated due covid last month. I’m personally immunocompromised every time leave house myself, it’s risk putting danger. Luckily, able keep potential exposure low side staying eating home, electing go crowded areas, grocery stores restaurants, etc. 

But people attitudes like your’s reason US poor state it’s currently in. Wake up. exactly local boarding school handling it, interesting experiment. general, called statistics. no..you say...really? believe it.   Lol, love dad-is-fed-up-with-your-nonsense routine. acceptable Timmy! Move spring everyone wins accept xfl. Even kids going nfl draft win aren’t risking health paid zero. COVID nowhere NEAR 5.5% kill rate. sniffles pretty much every study matter shows COVID MUCH widespread case numbers show. Glad there’s sanity threads.

People don’t realize think hospitalizations going down, many transferred long term care facilities like grandma.  yes right need change we're going down. rich ones leave planet smartest rest die sooner later anything regular person besides eat healthy exercise take basic supplements boost immune system? article say? wrong interpretation data? That’s true they’re vacation/recess rest month doesn’t change fact won’t see stimulus check September earliest unless get recalled. Gotta keep collection plates circulating. kept travel advisory guys would crying racist is. bad GOP really PUSHING start school reopenings first covid-19 symptom pink eye, probably got eye that, republican party live on. decades decades. They'll find less offensive version trump president. Yo need chill man. Two vaccines considered frontrunners (Oxford Moderna) actually progress extent COVID, fact Oxford's vaccine passed safety trials COVID. Moderna working technology eight years (Obama deserves credit making call lead this). Plus, worst side effects happen vaccination. Maybe I'm optimistic, definitely think quick solution we're hoping for. hope bro areas CA mandatiry mask laws place 3-4 months now. obviously magic bullet mask fetishists Reddit wish was.   got word happened. need release actual case notes I'll believe that.  football season happening wont end money college football, many smaller programs lot non revenue generating sports, particularly womens sports, look like chopping block due pandemic Ahh, mistake. Thank information. simulate it? Trump wants spread US virus around world. Yes indeed HOPES PRAYERS, GUYZ realistic way closing school least two weeks. 
She never thought could get virus. asked nursing assistant early weeks pandemic. “They told needed people, although experience, easy. said yes despite risk needed work daughter,” woman explained came Spain Honduras 2015 search means pay syndrome treatment child. hero. UK excess deaths US Fine. Go outdoor event lots people without mask. Feel free take chances without mask. Financial cushion. Lucky bastards.  I'm sorry. must incredibly frustrating. suit ass take daddy work day show what's up. Yes, yes did. Remember kids getting sprayed parents lysol coming home school first started? board wants deaths, they'll one way another. probably less people would die thing allowed run freely, loke states kept everything open. economy still going tits anyway. 

this win/lose situation, lose/lose situation accept lose something, pretend power end losing much more. go around calling others stupid can't even understand basic statistics, son.

Come back education delete *rest* braindead comments 😂 I'm Traverse City - every hotel motel filled like normal summer. Got takeout last night restaurant packed. pure insanity. source right-wing ""think tank.""

Judge accordingly. to, literally, **not catch AIDS**. **death sentence** pretty recently. wearing masks  doesn’t show blame house gets hero really outmaneuvered sadly also geriatric millennial. Bars overrated. I'd rather drink home.  stopping reservations cause tribes allowing through. Commercial vehicles, locals companies business allowed rez people passing denied entry. Actually equitable system would free Willing, extremely well informed, coerced it. ethical order tall. much man's best friend Noted article : ""Based data, cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate among children aged &lt;18 years March 1–July 25, 2020, 8.0 per 100,000 population"" also use FEB 27th tweet CDC show goes ""back forth"".

classic misinformation article IMO. Go beg table scraps billionaire overlords everyone else’s wages shrink cost living balloons, cult personality hero worship lame. people massive criticism Religion Politics make even smartest people make incredibly stupid decisions. mask studies make mistake. genuinely know they're bad messaging base gullible.

How every single replacement ineffective? Dems whole ass generations worth ""messaging issues.""

And examine actual legislation, pretty shitty. May people want party better know else blame messaging? I'm assuming mean Americans

Be glad please help Americans vote best can.

Help register voters, help election day transportation, food water lines. letting people GO WORK might prevent eviction crisis.... Whats helped someone starts talking conspiracy ""insert reason"", politely respond with, ""OK, we'll see."" brain seems short circuit response. 

The way see it, I've attempted warn friends family beginning. point going believe want doubt anything change they're personally affected. Even doubtful. sit back observe, hoping change. Well considering that's said yeah that's thought sounds like you’re saying kids go school else infect staff, like guy educator. guy’s example one teacher catching students, case doesn’t serve example. ability read statistics seems gone away.

Where see statistics? study study suggest average years life lost 10 (10.8 14). study suggests Italy lost 66-132k years life total, \~33k deaths. would 2-4 years lost per death. strong evidence counting.

For example, Western Canada, massive discrepancy (200% more) explained eventually dramatic increase overdose deaths.

Most countries examined excess deaths discrepancies ranging 20% hundreds percent covid-positive deaths. 30% particularly remarkable range.

Excess deaths crude metric making year year comparisons world socially economically turned upside down. say again, cases excess deaths triple covid-positive ones, explained away uptick opiate overdose. Noem idiot thinks entire state loves her. Problem is, saw government add YouTube saying wear masks keep want do. Counterproductive. Nearly **100,000** children tested positive coronavirus last **two weeks** July 

Out almost 5 million reported COVID-19 cases U.S ... **338,000** children.  

More 25 children died coronavirus July alone.  imagine enough wealth cure world hunger going, lol, nah. Bill Gates one evil human beings ever lived. Pure evil. see you’re saying significant percentage deaths could attributed lack healthcare delaying medical treatment diseases. Literacy rate Mississippi misleading well. one convinced.  mostly white city, Karens Kevins keep losing shit every time someone mentions reopening schools. probably assume precious kids immune 'other' kids be. medical community overwhelmed nobody seems following examining anyone unless sick ended hospital. Plus way easier examine people already hospitalized. want see data health people never hospitalized, also confirmed infected symptomatic. far tell, none exists. 6 months, that's inexcusable. One failure leadership. 95% 65 least one preexisting condition. 

Source? says otherwise. 
 I'm hoping tag related content (guy recovered home hospital) instead headline. worked remotely, husband. Since March actually, way life point. work virtual anyways. guy said ""one many"". That's limit. He's guy making rules regulations. opinion one dead kid disease many. prefers zero dead kids. many dead kids disease limit you? Yeah fuck Chinese government drone striking Iranian number 2 guy. website Rand Paul style politics circlejerk cherry-picked anecdotal evidence basically everything.

I genuinely hope ypu find peace. Stay safe friend. We'll get this. tests several problems. Propagation uncertainty keyword becoming important huge number tests done. Basically, number positive test results within expected error range tests like this. need design error in, sum human error, manufacturing tolerances etc. job. Well, *ARE* 12 months leap-year 57 states map using fractional reverse maff leaves 7 possible cases 1 really sick guy turns illegally count.

Fun fact: coroner Mississippi, need high school diploma. Mississippi high school diploma that. agree deaths reported, question much. Arizona, hospital moved grandma hospice free bed, said Covid pneumonia, died couple days later, telling reported death. triage-ing elderly sick like Arizona end June. far right said kids can't get covid? Oh man.

But, like, NONE FUCKING MATTERS WE'RE TALKING MAKING PERSON HOMELESS.

Maybe society garbage OK mad that. blame Anyone know stats kids asthma? Seems like always label kids underlying health conditions don’t often get details. 2 asthmatic kids make trips ER twice year due common cold/flu I’m interested many asthmatic kids gotten Covid.. It’s reasonable suspect it’s direct measurement like controlled clinical trial. You’re population level epidemiology it’s rigorous trial.

Edit: say. fucking trial. don’t guess. don’t infer. move forward confidence. think funny try show expert guidance gone ""back forth""... use CDC tweet FEB 27th.

Aslo, say Europe's top health officials... quote doctor. quoting top scientists top researchers.

This hallmarks shoddy reporting pushing agenda. proposals this. understanding hospitals researchers going protocols authorise studies, may know months. talking can't take vaccines. Talking won't. understand people sending kids school. super inconvenient keep child home causes able work health life far important. people believe can't happen them? really wounder. hope right. would control destinies.  live people still refuse wear mask !! never getting No, think random droppings. “Nemo touched butt!” mean great, love freedom number continue growing indefinitely. *will* new cluster point, maybe 1 1000 people coming border pass tests symptoms 14 days still it. end bell curve real. perhaps one border workers accidentally slip up.

Personally can't see us getting Christmas without cluster.

The point is, *when* happens, need super quick locking shit down, need Kiwis keep community testing high level detect new clusters early.

So keep getting tests done. free, it. Southwest wiping seats flights anymore. suggest finding top 10%? I'm flippant. read whole article, talks tough double working parent household also coordinate kids learning schedules among things. would March-June problem.

But summer normal kids home 2-3 months heading camps, daycare, staying grandparents? whatever normally worked out. get summer sucked kids, minimal social interaction peers, none camps sports might normally get do. 

But choosing school online school two many options could going school year. One course wait start school another month two. feels like would continuation summer. 

Anyone able work home kids home summer must much better position tons parents there. He's elected coroner former registered nurse, got appointed job dad died.

 Elected coroners like elected official, experience necessary. graduated High School would enough win election. 40 hour course need take, training times Independent thought incompatible conservatism. used lean conservative platform stood limited government, least sunshine, amount horseshit believe condone conservative quite simply unbelievable. sure actually meant scarred, work opinion.  seem making mistake many people reddit make assuming centrist = sides equally valid issues, case. 

Being centrist means align fully even majorly either group. typically means align group differently different issues. covid? rose-colored team dead wrong pretty much every single step way, refused fluid evolving changing situation. really middle ground leader utterly failed demonstrate leadership, lead directly chaos drastically worse situation needed be. There’s proof that’s anything exceedingly rare I...don't really care, honestly.

Yes, agree completely. money government gave huge corporations could instead paid every parent stay home pay childcare. country doesn’t believe citizens deserve something basic HEALTHCARE, that’s much ask. Didn’t argue point. good ya point out... again. Who's blaming kids?


I ask please send kids back school...... LOL, learn think budd instead parrot. Bernie always nothing pawn distraction hope none us likely ever get enjoy. single ounce critically thinking feeble little mind make infantile remarks.

The way US fix point completely clear house make politicians make less teachers. Here's thing. Summer 3 months long. much easier find care 3 months versus whole school year. that, lot families use teens sitters summer would option school starts. Perhaps parents take leave summer. several reasons would able continue summer. mean japan island country thats hard illegally get blowing due incompetence highest levels sales, can't imagine much sociopath mislead public resulting deaths overall stupidity nation.

Wait - they'll telling people tooth decay ""on last legs"" blame kids? Rindlisbacher contract virus capacity educator. many schools even open? came That's fun. I'll maybe get own! principal want open school forced to??

Neither. Schools open. nothing opening schools. also happens principal. said worried mom high blood pressure works autiistic high schoolers I’m double worried.

They would scared knew even mild copd breathing issue like. competent governments lol. means legal illegal borders dont really matter much competence govt become worth $118B nice guy. like people lost fucking perspective money, that's LOT money... oligarchs soaking much society's wealth absurd. hire PR people make look like benefactors. hire lawyers, accountants lobbyists make sure they, companies, pay little taxes possible. 

They become Kings. Whether that's good bad personal perspective. parents toss kids Tylenol reduce fever, send little viruses shoes straight school. bad parasitic leeches find way pay fair share taxes find ways molest children.

My previous comment censored containing word ""shitholes"". changed ""leeches"" even accurate reposted comment longer ""uncivil"" always like look data Italy Singapore. 99% fatalities Italy old folks health problems. side, Singapore concentrated 300 000 foreign workers dormitories. 50 000 got tested positive. None died Corona.

Why difference? miss opportunity call covid-19? ;p Next month going scary month northern European countries something right United States right. think getting away wearing masks mitigation methods place. five things limit spread, four them, maybe one enough screw things up. This. thing keeps awake night. year now, know virus going horrifying, learned hard way. always right wing response?

There elimination large reservoir people immune, without [impossible] restrictions movement people. She’s leaving kid grandma mean time so..... Wow, come conclusion like that? call racist!?! That's Terrible thing say French, dude wtf seriously fair, well aren’t screwed, kids still harmed pandemic pods whatever aren’t substitute actual socialization. really upsetting much country failed children (and MUCH others). people making shitty decisions generally adult children.  Republicans want anything destroy teachers' unions privatize education. using moment strike greatest blow. bad news. control many people get admitted hospitals, especially they're middle effort minimize extent pandemic. edge situations get sent home whereas would hospitalized. say interview well? swear said 2 separate occasions. Wow. Double that. sad, could’ve done much surgical masks wear fashion?

Hope goes through. quite easy see though? Nordic countries started restrictions around time, 11-14th March. start restrictions takes around 3 weeks affect death rate, one reasons people really freaking acting late still wait 3 weeks see effects. 3 week period Sweden went 0 deaths around 400 deaths, make clear without enough time would past make lockdown effect. period Norway went 0 ~25, Finland Denmark bit around 150 deaths. initial spread much higher Sweden already gained foothold restrictions cut off. 3 weeks past could see slow Nordic countries, including Sweden. since already spread takes much longer go normal again, like saw Italy Spain example. think many mock small towns football culture thing relevant, meanwhile cancelling college football hurt schools financially could even destroy number athletic programs. Yeah incompetence another issue. mean look UK. island nations done well, better, containing virus part don’t illegal border crossings. forget people protested Target walked TVs. Peacefully, course.  conspiracies turn true, doubt. History littered conspiracy corruption. time, feel like someone wanted microchip entire population already many opportunities so. vaccine fluid pandemic? annual flu vaccines? tap water? sprinkled Doritos? sky vapors people concerned about? lot bigger problems hands microchip, unwilling dig hole, like stubborn donkeys, fear distrust leaders. resist now? ten years ago? We've known corruption government business long. let get this, take stand - vaccine - thing help us get historically destructive pandemic? Humanity nothing, irrational. Okay take Canadian government instead people actually know let know goes fifty years. vaccine free manufacture? better tell Serum Institute India Gates Foundation DONATED money priced $14 per dose. Additionally, India vaccine court. 

So, basically, every single thing said wrong. Congratulations. Meanwhile, half world containing it, treating potential disaster numbers flare levels 1/10th average American state.

No excuse. He'll leave light ya. people drastically reducing testing would never manipulate hospitalization data... encourage less admissions faster dismissals. ""go home hope feel better btw"" live US man. Phoenix full lockdown month. Maybe 2. even ventured downtown took photos. Streets baron. like apocalypse movie. problem was, cities/states same.

Asymptomatic ER everything in-between ""mild"" definition that's point I'm making  It’s probably better fall dangerously ill. imagine loud shitheads would shouting hoax got mild symptoms. popular approach refusers sign waiver agreeing pay medical costs get sick. tricky though we're talking vaccinating kids, person refusing pays stupidity, also kids real choice matter. comment related using discrepancy evidence counting covid-positive fatalities. lot people seem think 30% discrepancy strong evidence under-counting covid-positive fatalities. not. mentioned two well-known secondary mechanisms virus causing increase fatalities year year. going Asians danes issue. offense, way cases way experiences. here’s effective vaccine different coronavirus that’s used cows. said help covid. I’m sure follow logic. saying sit back let Trump solve Yes does. everything testing. exactly everyone asking for. Everyone wants availability testing. 
I agree, America healthy. HUGE problem. try change bottom up, agenda vs agenda corporations. messaging vs resources financial backing, mention government also side. sure messaging (which require lot money deliver) game par, sure, worth shot. government actually power change things work corporations. take lot money effort too, better shot going corporations directly. government supposed be. stop powerful preying weak. betterment society whole. corrupted, sure, fixed. Otherwise, instead letting misused, tear down. ""Viruses kill people. People kill people!"" ""Jokes you! pretending retarded!""  Yeah, right. neighbors south - close fucking Dells - suck begin TBH don’t think ever working vaccine. They’ve trying create one HIV decades. Fauci known better made public statements possible Covid. mean they’re work? totally fault. random three letters. go WSU know lot I've saying exact opposite I'm much knowledge field, wonder could use data excess deaths estimate total number infected individuals US, assuming accurate estimate infection fatality rate (IFR). Someone expertise subject, please give feedback thoughts here! would greatly appreciate it.

From could find, estimates IFR COVID-19 0.5-1.0% source also gives equation IFR: IFR =(# deaths/# infected)*(100). Plugging numbers have, estimate # infected individuals US. rounded 200,700 number simplicity.

If IFR% = 0.5:

0.5 = (2*10^5/#infected)*(100)

0.5 = (2*10^7/#infected)

(0.5)(#infected) = (2*10^7)

#infected = (2*10^7/0.5)

# infected = 4*10^7 40,000,000


If IFR% = 1.0:

# infected = (2*10^5)*(100) [simplified x*1 =x]

# infected = 2*10^7 20,000,000

Thus, upper lower limit estimate # infected individuals US. accurate, accurate number COVID-19 cases US could 20 million 40 million.

If estimate way accurate, actual case count COVID-19 US could 4-8 times official count confirmed cases ~4.9 million course, estimate relies lot assumptions, major biases data. biggest assumption ~200,000 excess deaths reported Mar 15 Jul 25 attributable COVID-19. another factor responsible significant portion number, estimate infections less accurate.

Again, little knowledge field, even know valid approach estimating number actual infected individuals. please come conclusions based this! Actual scientists statisticians surely studying much better methods, please research! putting disclaimer want spread misinformation.

If anyone knowledge input anything I've said here, please share it!

(EDIT: Added number confirmed cases CDC link) Family made construct? That’s probably stupidest thing read Reddit today, probably don’t get along well family prefer think that’s made up.

No, that’s lottery system. buy ticket might win. hope become clinically depressed millionaires kinda depends worried about. worried contracting virus, I'd say maybe avoid gym since people around take measures seriously (remember, masks protects others, mask protect you)

However, worried potentially asymptomatic carrier spreading virus, respecting measures place careful around people *probably* enough (there's guarantee, obviously, risk go down) think facts logic matter arguments? We’ve 4 years trump 40% support. guarantee facts play role positions. gotta admit, admissions essay gonna SLAP

""When Good Morning America interviewed whistleblowing unsafe conditions schools, resulting brief suspension, several thoughts went head ..."" xD  “It is” - orange shit high school max number days could miss would automatically fail. way around every one days excused doctor. I've heard enough people places talk know uncommon policy. elementary school niece goes to, 7 absences 9 week period results referral social services (found website). Truancy laws also thing. Fact is, can't choose send kid school. laws policies place made situation mind. media told us so

[google reason author matters, way verify conflicts interest. Identifying conflicts interest makes easier identify areas paper need additional scrutiny. There's also pesky ethics part equation. case experimental study (as opposed meta analysis like this) knowing authors also help validate data. author claiming data someplace (say, african hospitals) they're junior researcher American based company ties, active connections, contracts said African hospitals, makes easier spot potential fraud (in case made data/unvalidated data) would red flag study. things like that, difficult spot faked data without knowing individual is. 

In case authors site, I'm fairly certain heavy political motivation possibly lack credentials style analysis. Additionally authors indicate ratings results weighted age factors, least best tell clarify **how** weighting factors are. also bring things like Nigeria vs NYC try hand-wave away age difference, quite possibly biggest factor, along co-morbidities. Keep mind NYC basically ravage retirement assisted living homes, probably at-risk group imaginable, Nigeria hit general population, younger lot fewer co-morbidities. also issue lot early HCQ places good data likely counting cases deaths order magnitude two. 

We've several controlled studies point, 1 showing significant effect (the Henry Ford study) 2 3 showing change, 3 4 would discard poorly designed/controlled. weight evidence controlled studies currently suggests HCQ either minimal effect effect. Given evidence would take meta analysis like large grain salt start looking potential factors involved. man, calm down. We're done. We're making great progress. go away, quickly, quickly. day people die one day closer defeating horrible thing. like house fire, let burn, calm down, go away.

/s See above. Antibodies whole story immunologists, virologists ID specialists, they're straightforward marker overall immune memory. we're immunised infected virus previously, antibody levels drop still tend basal levels circulating around, allows immune system rapidly responding largely process called opsonisation. antibodies fall become virtually undetectable, generally harbinger lost immunity would need boosting restore enough immune memory combat infection. Two weeks?! Jesus Christ that's incubation period. probably already millions. that. Act like fucking common sense would fair start. infection rates go due vaccine due another factor you’re aware of?

Let's real here: *no* regions infection rate dropped nothing. There's enough empirical evidence say Russia starts seeing significant drop infection rates deploying vaccine, really reasonable theory say vaccine working. know ir could seem way, want say, you’re feeding troll. need call teachers organize walkouts. can’t fire every teacher students eventually without educators states choice give in. makes great press release know won’t true. dick ranges size .5” 4” full mast Makes lot sense guess. Keep good fight! absolutely need do. guy evangelizing while. FDA needs stop sitting hands. Taking account recent excess deaths report, seems already eclipsed number. one example. wonder call people left money afford bike, time use boring ass trip pretty boring festival, middle biggest stretch fly country MIDDLE FUCKING PANDEMIC!? Spring break older idiots. four series canceled covid Agreed.

To clarify, 'I told so' moment doesnt require side admit it, frankly common admit somehow blame ppl told so. Ask anyone IT! don’t want responsible 7-4 whatever. like 300k+ covid+ results children? 97k last 2 weeks? ""It is."" \*looks USSR playbook\* Throw hard labor 20 years please Beats dieting Well right he’s invested heavily helping third world countries. It’s USA boat new illness. guy projecting fucked world view. certainly wasn’t blaming them, know agencies supplied. however, seen many cops nose mask, mask around neck. least critical law enforcement behaving like general public.

Nothing’s gonna stop putting Harley trailer driving South Dakota RV riding around town like bad ass! Gotta keep collection plates circulating. Sure..all Democrats fault lol. Hong Kong: Keep Keeping On.

USA: YOLO one, herd immunity strategy (a herd immunity strategy would essentially let many people possible get number immune people becomes significant), ""soft lockdown"", aggressive testing contact tracing, combined social distancing guidelines education population

&amp;#x200B;

But perfect success story either, death rate per capita much higher neighbors, epidemiologists admitted strict lockdwn would allowed better prepare pandemic

 cancel school/economy makes people’s lives difficult it’s fault. open things covid wrecks havoc, it’s covids fault people charge “guiltless”. It’s dumb, that’s little minds work. even post sorts stories can't believed? know truth rich get first, countries. religion, ideology, tribe dominantly power, guess getting vaccines first regions control? sorts stories basically telling us world's rich powerful better people world getting vaccines first, that's story always been. sure accidents went significant amount? road accidents dipped slightly month so, deaths per mile driven went up, cancelling lot gains driving much. (Could result excess alcohol consumed), heard household accidents actually lot people spent time working around house. closing business US government respond fast enough, plenty time prepare. countries got top quick enough made 10x worse themselves, places like UK/US mightily fucked absolutely correct. Less terrible, still terrible. alternative LOT nuanced that. net worth doubled generation vaccines.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* would want use another term? Rare accurate. opinion Sweden really plummeted. dont think word ""shut down"" means think means certainly hope so. Wow guys excited this. I'm surprised People like throw 61,000 people dying year flu. Consider covid killed 150,000 people, even full year. People like compare apples oranges serve interests, simply cannot compare 2. year, compare flu. much number people killed, ton, comparatively flu, rate growth rate killing people. Hospitals get swamped truckloads dead carted away flu season, covid. That's difference. I’m agreeing think. I’m saying capitalism without restriction regulation whatsoever bad communism terms abuse people. capitalism easier put leashes make work. correct, virologists infectious disease specialists project team constantly roll eyes meme ""it's cell response matters"". Firstly talk T-cells neglects specify actually argued two types T-cells--CD4 CD8. CD4 T-cells ""helper T-cells"" help coordinate immune response (and targeted HIV) course always going involved--and viruses vaccines, key initial effector response CD4 cells stimulation adaptive immunity form B-cells (the type lymphocyte) produces circulating antibodies. turns out, patients true immunity (with substantial immune memory) present, almost always basal levels circulating antibodies present, even many years administration vaccine previous infection. antibodies fall nearly undetectable levels, reported studies COVID-19, tends immunological signature overall lymphocytic response (including helper T-cell response, coordinates everything) tends quite poor immune memory low.

Yes, lymphocytes specifically CD8 ""killer"" T-cells. killer T-cell response effective cells already infected--a much slower delayed process compared humoral (antibody) response--so CD8 cells mounting response large number infected cells, means patient likely going active infection capable shedding enough coronavirus spread others. again, basal antibody levels decline thoroughly, means CD4 T-cell memory low, means CD8 response would also low even slower rev up. Yes, low undetectable antibody presence 2-3 months previously infected patients mean there's immunity all, there's lot know COVID-19 immunology specifically. based what's consistently seen true immunity before, disappearance antibodies tend correlate low lymphocytic responsivesness, including T-cells general activation interactions. even view risk. rate things going, expected average IQ America go due sheer amount idiots getting killed. huh? study  Actually SSA started going upside Pres. Clinton tied federal disability program it. research. First non surplus year SSA year fiasco. 1995. Like said, depends goal is. Indirect deaths may relevant goal. may need distinguish direct indirect. Neither inherently better accurate other. They're different metrics. Yes wont fund rapid testing, key. means ppl arent returning work whilst waiting results spreading it. 

We results 24hrs - 3 days Overweight boomers respiratory virus, name iconic duo. fragile LOL, i'm saying guys quick defending protesters. Also watch videos portland protests, see people wearing masks.  Prediction: Based Fauci said earlier week, setup big drop vaccines working planned. close schools? got test results (negative). say swab collected 7/28, received 7/29, reported 8/2, actually get test results email 8/7 full 10 days swab. would good enough establish form protection, particularly young seem transmit virus elderly vulnerable willing get one. one two I'd much concerned. National news piece bandanas used masks said worse mask large droplets get broken smaller ones fabric person talks, sneezes, coughs. masks improve chances avoiding virus bandanas increase risk. Oh god. really think? world big hoax get Trump out? Italy killed 30 thousand people get Trump? 

How self centered Americans be? I'm guessing never left America. Grant Imahara passed away started looking way reduce risk. lower sodium like changes. overall health also fringes mental health good I'll stop looking it. people shitting streets take baths told good medical system accessible  hope right It’s one Right’s new talking points. Instead worrying kids catching covid, worried CHILD TRAFFICKING PEDOS! idea talking point came (Fox news? Facebook memes?), it’s right-leaning family members’ pages.

(Disregard funding family social services would go long way toward keeping kids safe predators, kidnappings aren’t contagious.) Right point still stands it’s lauded cure reality needs studied further. isn’t event considered national homeland security risk?

Because Trumpanzees. started projections said would millions death, let bit sceptical attain statistics I've searching study like months! I've using gaiter wondered effectiveness, guess need new mask. mention homemade cotton masks performed relatively well can't find information made mask used study. anyone assist? I'm even sure number corresponds homemade mask. Yep covid stop wear masks! Exactly doing, except grocery runs. Even infrequent use delivery services.

But fellow countrymen care .. suppose watch home see happen next. concerned nothing do. county requiring masks always followed. ""we""?

The stupid loud minority? 100k spent Russia Facebook ads nothing. epoch times, funded state department spends millions Facebook ads. recently banned though spreading covid misinfo pro Trump propaganda. go ahead delete feel absolutely gutted people die alone/can’t see loved ones one last time, angle glad got experience this, lack true precaution astonishing, alongside fact needed cared whole team doctors exposed well.

I'm sure everywhere, mainly providing counterpoint 'don't good jobs 4 weeks PTO US' comment parent. Yeah serious shifting goalposts here. keep masking social distancing vaccine, also flatten curve (or, live, Canada, keep flat). absolutely *not* OK keeping whole life. isolation starting take serious toll me, mentally, see also lot friends family. think hard sell tell people keep life like even vaccine. Almost every expert says COVID-19 going endemic already endemic, thought game-plan vaccine would allow us resume normal life keeping COVID-19 manageable level (sort like flu vaccine... flu never really left, probably never leave...) 4 ways? must introduction full report. cramp calf... turned sarcoma. extremely unlikely outcome common symptom (rhabdomyosarcoma apparently incidence around 4 million).

I've seen thousands people calf cramps time doctor... precisely none due sarcoma. fact think I've ever seen calf rhabdomyosarcoma.

It's pretty unfair call irresponsible.

If ignoring chest pains shortness breath yeah she'd stupid. That’s pathetic. chance prove wrong, know fucked argument, telling research? LOL!! conversation over. time research it, didn’t know nothing. Lame.

If one that’s making claim, back up. I'm US, decided going friend's outdoor wedding yesterday. Saw pics today, 20-30 people mask sight Ireland panicking American vacationers, us Canada shitting bricks Right. depends lot question worded. I'm gonna first line, cause takes years develop vaccines get one 10 months, want first Guinea pig.

That mean I'm gonna get one *ever*. Let put way — fauci objectively correct everything he’s saying. said, way I’m wearing mask distancing next 10 years. Uhh communism means stateless society. Literally opposite much government control. everything half way, half shut downs, half population wear masks etc... ignoring infectious pandemic. Hundreds thousands died due virus year, think blown proportion people die cancer heart disease. 

I probably surprised people react strange ways something unusual (though particular unusual historical timeframes). Yes, probably over-reacting, see making historical comparisons numbers can't normally comprehend seem like fear mongering. I'm sure read comparison WWII think diminishing pandemic WWII saw US fighting 3 4 years casualties like we've seen coronavirus. German remembera poll suggesting 60%. Fine me, increases chance able get hands vaccine. course do, mandated. That's issue.  ilk celebrate lockdowns mask orders like bunch fuckin sheep , cuz gubmint said so.  Think realize enabling imprisonment endorsing buying fear. dealer said prices shot lockdown. said paying £4500 whatever amount buys pays £5400. doesn’t mean comment flu shot way relevant issue rapid antigen test less reliable, it’s usually paired slower, reliable PCR swab test.

Thanks comment tho already farce. I'm surprised seen even cases. keep piling doubleheaders end season, that's good trick! sustained 1,000+ deaths day now. 300,000 certainty IMO. 1,000 deaths day November Vaccine Party wins nowhere surprise miracle cure, still past threshold come January.

What drastic positive change envision current situation near future? Anything would news me. Schools opening people still hard headed ever. 

I made mistake listening Ben Shapiro podcast recently there's significant number people actively taking medical/preventative advice anti-mask morons like him. guess point is, people changing quickly enough avoid 300,000 deaths. hope avoid 500,000 ""official"" deaths. You’re also forgetting people don’t die still serious illness. average age hospitalization far lower, even minor cases long lasting side effects. Lung scarring, etc. buddy mine thinks ground glass opacity symptomatic covid positive patients presages massive pneumonia fall winter helps vs covid irrelevant. want get around time. flu shot gives 30% less chance getting flu I'll take it. get covid, less chance get flu middle flu season navigate healthcare system better.

You want battling virus time. Proof sending people home results less hospitalizations? can't help figure out, sorry.

As deaths, believe me, Mark today's date check excess deaths week 2-8 weeks cdc page. Gee, I’m surprised haven’t asked US guidance /s positivity rate important. problem they're shooting 50 percent effective rate vaccine, hopefully like 70, even 30 percent population refuse vaccinate still leaves lot people vulnerable lower effectiveness rate even vaccinated. Basically I'm saying anti vaxers going fucking fuck us over. No, could made deal play hero instead hopes buy good epic loss november. 9 people tested positive place hundred test positive short order depending size school. guess even [Cat rational thinker...

I hope things clear soon visit, transfer positions, move leave mess behind. Even family. Honestly, one could seen coming. fault, there's way could enforced mask wearing.

Girls baring shoulders though, that's need take hard line!!  math always bit shaky. Explain feasibly reduce workforce 90% without use online (which would assume impossible teach equivalent numbers kids 9/10 teachers removed). would think say 20% needed, 10 course either expenses go workforce stays reduced meaning students/teacher.

Oh no, they’ve gotten rid limiting sick days/absences year. problem parents thinks school daycare sends kids whether they’re healthy not. Symptoms? Take Tylenol/medicine send anyway. Seems getting better. Hospitalizations deaths starting follow downward trend well. Still bad, getting better. Well going get second term irrelevant. Yes know.

I’m talking back then. I’m talking consistent failure trump administration. literally, intentionally slowed testing down-

SO DOESN’T MAKE LOOK BAD. 

He still lying today. Still saying “it’s going away” “it’s control” certainly not. 

Back January China absolutely should’ve transparent. not. Yet, trump thanked China “transparency, behalf America people” anyway. Hmmmm. 

By time march rolled around, deep. trump everything could slow testing down! It’s here. It’s here. China fucked up, sure. would confidently argue trump derelict duty people. Beyond that, slowed testing people STILL can’t get results without waiting week places. 

All truth makes look like monster is.

You're comparing full year flu deaths normal school year 4 months covid school. sure let's fuckin open schools get accurate comparison. asshat. People complained.

And started wearing masks.

You're fragile ಠ_ಠ I’m sorry community’s loss.. Don’t know fall politically, Biden’s platform significantly progressive Trump’s. mean Biden man great person? I’m arguing one. Masks considered less effectice social distancing, hand washing avoiding crowded indoor spaces impeding person-to-person contamination.

But surgical masks prevent droplets projection, known decades medical staffs specialized technicians wear them. zero split question.

The issue average joe may wear improperly, may touch often touch surfaces feel protected may discard social distancing. authorites sure pushing masks situation would cost-effective. UK, comes deaths-of-people-who-have-tested-positive, may wait days.

Second, please send poutine.  Thanks. Truly appreciate understanding. I’ve blown away symptoms evolving COVID similar sound Behcet’s body. Obviously, different illnesses manifest differently every person, similarities include: inflammation vascular system, potential blood clots, inflammation lungs (tho far worse different COVID), brain fog &amp; swelling, fatigue, fevers, etc etc.

I’ve disease entire life (I’m 41 yrs old). lot healing work basically went remission 15 yrs ago - occasional mild flare - plan take chance know horrible life feels chronically ill. stay inside long need to. 

People never experienced chronic illness cannot comprehend might experience get COVID suffer long-term symptoms (even exhaustion &amp; brain fog). did, wouldn’t cavalier lives. 

Stay safe kind stranger. 🙏 think another unidentified illness killed 54,000 Americans don’t care either. What’s endgame vaccine doesn’t end then? wait year two herd immunity? I’ve read without modern vaccine technology would taken five years. Okay, let 'em take it. point give fuck. people want willingly live ignorance, free roll dice loved ones' lives. rest us healthy move catastrophe.

The current outbreak corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), affected almost entire world become pandemic now. Currently, neither FDA approved drugs vaccines available control it. recently Bangladesh, group doctors reported astounding success treating patients suffering COVID-19 two commonly used drugs, Ivermectin Doxycycline. current study explored possible mechanism drugs might worked positive response COVID-19 patients. explore mechanism used molecular docking molecular dynamics simulation approach. Effectiveness Ivermectin doxycycline evaluated Main Protease (Mpro), Spike (S) protein, Nucleocapsid (N), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, NSP12), ADP Ribose Phosphatase (NSP3), Endoribonuclease (NSP15) methyltransferase (NSP10-NSP16 complex) SARS-CoV-2 well human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. study shows Ivermectin doxycycline significantly bind SARS-CoV-2 proteins Ivermectin better binding doxycycline. Ivermectin showed perfect binding site Spike-RBD ACE2 interacting region indicating might interfering interaction spike ACE2 preventing viral entry host cells. Ivermectin also exhibited significant binding affinity different SARS-CoV-2 structural non-structural proteins (NSPs) diverse functions virus life cycle. Significant binding Ivermectin RdRp indicate role inhibition viral replication ultimately impeding multiplication virus. Ivermectin also possess significant binding affinity NSP3, NSP10, NSP15 NSP16 helps virus escaping host immune system. Molecular dynamics simulation study shows binding Ivermectin Mpro, Spike, NSP3, NSP16 ACE2 quiet stable. Thus, docking simulation studies reveal combination Ivermectin doxycycline might executing effect inhibition viral entry enhance viral load clearance targeting various viral functional proteins. 2B.

Let's say sleeps month, allowing spread. wakes fucks 99% mortality rate. would pretty much end world humanity. classic anti-vax rhetoric. results saftey trials efficacy trials published. ""They"" FDA, EHA, MRHA etc going approve unsafe vaccine regardless whose pockets might think they're in. 

This going next step massive failure US kill tens thousands people willing trust science regulatory agencies successfully determining safe decades. World War III

You saying US death toll greater US WW2 death toll like WW3? 

Do idea many Europeans Asians died WW2?  US tangentially involved compared suffered. 

This nothing like WW2. Almost like high population density areas ideal conditions transnitting contagious virus  Absolutely false. tried compromising MANY things reds budge inch. dragged feet weeks even proposing counter offer scarred Russia please protect us... Here's lunch box. Excess deaths higher, count means terms percentage deaths caused COVID vs. deaths occured someone COVID still fully Yes, may difference DALYs lost 68 versus now. old people's lives considered forfeit they're old. People's lives worth saving they're prime.

On individual level yes, old people considered, rights like anyone else. societal level need prioritize point. Lives varying degrees value absolute sense, talking policy outright affects everyone society need consider those. iis comfortable fun thing do, must done. purely societal preservation progress perspective makes sense prioritize elderly reaction comprehensive efficient. Controlling virus minimizing death solves problems related spread.

It doesn't. sense, minimizing deaths solved problems locking entirely, forcing people homes, burning virus would best solution. obviously it'd create far problems deaths virus.

There absolute statements situation. Everything value equation, whether want not. $$$ IDOMD says less 25%.

covid.idmod.org/#/ could means supposition. Although articles literally saying BLM protests slowed pandemic BS like this. Sadly BS supposed news, people might actually believe word word. Also, morons everywhere, even group people like dislike. What‘s flu shot like? 

Is like vaccine might slight problems next day like tetanus makes want rip arm out? Imagine criticizing someone living state whose economy likely supporting state’s inability govern exactly I'm it. Let die. pull ""so much tolerant left"" bullshit guess what? I'm tolerant left. radicle left. believe shunned ridiculed ignorance, stupidity, form outdated mindset holds society hostage 1920's. Duck people. beneath educated countrymen need shown rightful place created temporary UBI like Andrew Yang suggested

Did even read persons comment? generation Americans would lost ww2 Karen would refuse ration Chad would dodge draft. never see person outside families outside church social gatherings year.

Going disagree bit. Grew small town (around 800) one bigger ones. Yeah, mostly farming community, people would congregate one five churches one five bars. went bars, would often drive back home drunk. lot people lived like mile apart, gather quite often. Worst attempt gotcha I've ever seen. Unfortunately $150k stipend ""low risk"" players must repaid next year, even players make roster. Players deemed ""high risk"" medical history family member get $350k need repaid. 

All money NFL best do. love football NFL sucks. Yea well yall go riot 10,000 people say riots spread virus 50 people church proudly stay “ ignorant” one. Ever again. I've sold medicare Brockway, Ogdenville, North Haverbrook, and, gum, put map! Haha stop talking it’ll go away right? tiny brain works Agree. feel empati comming female leaders. always gov parsons 🤦🏻‍♂️ hate stupid state... Yeah Dude, don't. going accomplish comment inspire stupid people go: ""yeah, fuck wearing pants"" bus seat droopy ball sack adjacent. I’m happy people dying. anyone die, I’m okay non mask wearing, anti science, hand sanitizer drinking nut jobs. Covid hits dumb, ignorant, especially hard. Aw hope too! That’s another place I’d love visit. would expect US 5x cases example orders magnitude more. ~3 months Missouri smashed curve lockdowns active across state. reopening plan may fail, people saying ""they nothing, modified behavior one month would fine"" ignorant situation yokels think want die tribute Trump. want smoking!!! would maybe buy ever received first check. *When actual government tries make people actively distrust media pass anti science / pro billionaire policies Oh, win interaction? know, thanks recognizing that. highly doubt number 42, would guess along lines 20%. feel offended. happening insane regularity, imo... BS. many years people Sturgis welcomed racist scum town. Look Confederate flags, Nazi symbols. Shake hands devil hands get dirty. Wearing mask literally costs nothing. people stupid thing? government tells wear pants, too. That’s bothered most. Governors pompous politicians know better Sheriffs. supposed ones community looks co-worker going want dumbshit come back work 14 God damned fucking days.  sick idiocy US.  Freedom needs spelled Freedumb! Minneapolis weekend. got back home. state mandate awesome city. see anyone without one. 

But south Minnesota go see people wearing them. defiant around chin. 

Then get Iowa city shit show. Yes, look many models, prefer one goes November.  got long ways go beyond that. spot on, mate. may necessary, unfortunately. current pivot. trying share information relating current cases involving kids US, instead discussing that, denialists accuse person caring child trafficking pedophilia. People know I’m mandated reporter (teacher) accused past week. It’s frustrating, can’t imagine much would OP. US response....or rather non-response entire ordeal really scary. Granted, US big ass country, size population but...

The US cases (and track deaths) entirety EU countries like India China billion people.

The US many deaths even though hindsight big outbreaks countries.

The US also one financially capable countries paper compared big countries handled much better.

But hasn't. point, even many developing countries dealing better despite obvious limited financial capabilities massive populations.... actual death rate? sorry. hear you. probably thinks came Hillary's email server. wrong US? Like i've said before, called rally protest, virus would stayed away. scientifically proven! Still minimizing time public here. want shit. sacrifice year avoid potential future organ trouble. Yup. writing wall concerning months imo, watching people behave stupidly selfishly, none ""wake call"" unless affects personally need hospital stay damn lung transplant.

To say sucks ass us took seriously, understatement life. horrible mental health, sadly, fucking reality it. lives stunted/on hold, go health care provider get vaccine. awful reality it. Lots bootlickers here, landlords. ... realize daily growth rate exceeds us several day last week. 

And right, would never expect country 67 million amount deaths country 328 million. feel bad tbh. Especially see videos like (All gas breaks - 4th July). Yes, .3% listen that's enough deny science. Pivot Ireland. never understood people don’t take preventative measures assumption God save you. Growing Christian household, always told God helps help themselves. God wants us protect other, play part spreading it. Y’all really still trying scare people? Sheesh. Governor Holcomb makes want vomit. USA officially become ignorant nation all. Hard say proud American type nonsense continues worst situation almost every single American see lifetime. can't reason stupid. masks actually something 50 million Americans caught virus everyone wearing them? made list. Nice projecting. I’m even American couldn’t vote wanted too. keep seething. I’m also agnostic. diagnosed “sIcK BeYoNd HeLp” hahaha. popular vote

i mean got like 45% he...

that's basically half country nuts. Ahh, America... global leper colony 2020.  early results America's COVID19 Great School-Reopening Experiment start roll in, conclude following:

...A combination completely half-assed safety measures, non-existent enforcement, school administration's denial severity virus, surprisingly yield good results! Shocking, it!? ever. Pelosi Schumer much busy explaining urgency necessity economic crisis facing Americans actually compromise Republicans get us fucking money. Yes lots us care. situation find completely unacceptable. 

The problem rule minority party. party actually got votes power.

And correct flaw government, down, black white, wrong right, lies truth. 

Because way currently set up, losers winners. selfish capitalism, UK smaller scale figures fiddled make seem less.  US successfully sold American Way brand world, turns Colossus feet clay. expensive paper wrap covering inedible treat. dreaming coming States pandemic, breathing American values, crisis apparent much third world country actually is. Trump could disappear puff smoke, millions people voted idiotic, anti-science beliefs would still exist. met incredulity here, too. school district US same. They're required 100% time.... sit seat. Classrooms can't sit 6 feet apart keep on. yeah want sit 6 feet apart someone unmasked someone coughing. 6 feet enough scenario. Imagine uncovered sneeze.   God damn you, comment made laugh way much I’m Midwest Friday largest school area announced 100% remote. I’m teacher neighboring county. Today, MIL told stupid go remote one know it. nephew pregnant wife April... reminded said, “but mean like severe case”. We’re doomed. Many us absolutely care putting lives indefinitely part limiting spread. rest us dumber realized, sense empathy social responsibility, undermining significant efforts former utter stupidity selfishness. Deflation terrifying, infinitely absurd inflation debt fears bandied relief bill. meant handle this. must run IE, instance.

And you’re applauding team made app must run IE? professional dev team reasonable caliber would rejected mandate violation cyber security policies. 

Just somebody tasks project make piece shit doesn’t mean it, especially becomes security vulnerability.

Case point: server “mysteriously” shutdown. much wanna bet due hacker exploiting obviously poorly engineered web server? ""Quick...everyone stop counting fatalities ""

US DOH - probably problem knowing do, refusing cooperate. Whoa whoa... Albuquerque Neal Pert, soooo....whose gonna bitching drum solos? Thank god school districts around closed in-person classes; siblings go school worried schools reopening. also essentially gave students chromebooks use distance learning even issued high school students webcams students needed it. reason schools open meal-to-gos students rely it. 

That said, mom basically said siblings going anywhere schooling anyhow (even district said so). Yep. Thats basically next years. No, don't, live country like it, leave. hell everyone affects me, everyone help me! Gods
Please let antibodies treatments work
I'm 
So tired Nah, ideological. Jeanine Áñez pretty badly too. ? absolutely insane amount people get wearing mask helps reduce spread. many people think they're asked wear mask protect themselves. Here's science. simple test. far droplets go face covering- 8 feet

bandana-3 feet

handkerchief-a little foot

cone shaped mask- 8 inches.

and worried contaminated masks. 2 masks, wash one use it.  There's plenty people loved Sons Anarchy lot trailer trash loved see goal. actually case, New York nearly everyone it.

With 450,000 infections actual infection rate 10x-50x higher tested cases, number total infected likely least 4.5 million likely higher. New York 8.7M residents.

For example, 68% hospital residents already antibodies Covid-19.  Good see post India sub, barely gotten attention lately. dream visit Ireland supposed happen year postponed pandemic started. Americans ever actually get pandemic we're going (more) hated abroad. Weirdly enough would trust one aspect actually vaccinating me. Yeah hahah like I’m single taxes last year easily gotten one. parents live house got still didn’t. Pretty sure we’re suppose write taxes next year fuck us Here’s deal tho-. hotels Greece won’t give refunds. booked January July. Spent March trying get 3 refunds hotels. Although cannot fly banned hotels literally say cannot stay still got zero money back even voucher. rich person. saved 4 years take 3 kids Greece 50th birthday. Given job would great money pay rent. Greece F point. It’s another reason everyone hate us....I hate us right now. enough don’t care old”

The rampant ageism freaks out. want people 65 die prematurely. perspective: Americans killed army navy WW2 (318,274). Total US military (all 4 branches) dead WW2 (407,316). waves, tide rising, New Orleans. There's website volunteer, though URL. think well 100,000 people sign last checked. think leading vaccines already volunteers phase 3 trials, sample sizes around 30,000 they'll work way list pretty fast. When. Name once. recover become pro-prevention, counterparts accuse becoming ""liberal mouthpieces"" Fancy Jesus.

I mean, knew coming, would idiot think wouldn't. think part deep deep hoping people right overly concerned. kind hoping charge knew something didn't. definitely think conscious level, like deep down, sake freaking every day absolutely insanely horribly leaders handling this, hoping knew something didn't.

I wonder much worse get might admit wrong learn mistakes.

And yes know solution get vote extent, feel like that's basically equivalent close door button elevator, especially state California. vote simply make difference, despite people feel, genuinely feel people vote less individual vote matters. too. peds floor got converted overflow adult COVID unit got slammed (we open two overflow icus, half adult med surg floors converted covid units provides perspective). see stat there. really. quite possible could hit million. Maybe time bring closer home everyone. 

""How many people know?""

""Which want die?"" exactly going said done? people something realizing things pandemic never will.

You running time implement change. November. - game over. USA death per capita rate 50, New York 168. want rest country look like that? Really? finding far right family was, much moron lot are. considered smart people lot trust them. ripped cool maaaan. time thought kinda dumb really. may hard time paying attention able read book, least open mind listen experts see whats going there. America I'd suspect hoax perhaps. entire world. dragging dont implement basic countermeasures. 

its largely western europe win them. want less educated people it’s easier manipulate less educated people. They’re vocal minority several major media outlets amplifying message, including Facebook Fix News.

What progressive outlets there? CA none crimes puts jail lol. Assuming able keep decent paying job coming economic apocalypse live west side Indianapolis nearly everyone wearing masks public places I’ve visited central indiana. Monon Tail yesterday lots people wore masks, even exercising. friends wore masks every stop. bullshit article making blanket accusations toward republican states. I’m republican. saying true tell. Hundreds thousands dead Americans blink eye, ask Ben ghazi.... Wait, Smash Mouth biker band‽ owns media US. lot people do. people charge not. Unfortunately. Assuming source reputable still says

""Our work intended serve as, substitute for, medical advice. find latest information COVID-19 local government health authority. protect coronavirus, please visit the WHO CDC."" 

In words, listen WHO, they've also run numbers. There's possibly something source missed, small percentage changes add big population.

Secondly wearing mask big deal, causes reduction risk catching potentially fatal virus even kill still give long term lung damage think worth it. 99.9% seems accurate. Masks work. 

I’ll join protest 10k protestors masked 50 hicks wearing mask inside enclosed, small space like church day week. Got source that? usual pessimism. busy trying ruin Double Deuce, what?

Shitloads people saying months regarding reopening schools always say would never wear mask bank, BS.

My bank let anyone without mask in, screen everyone enter. Uh oh ... pfffhahahahahahahahahahaaha

Whew... wait moment-

hahahahhahahah know lot virus statistics

I believe using word correctly Lol can't fix stupid. ""Americans smart enough recognize entire society favor personal health - would care themselves?""

A plausible explanation I've seen recently is... racism. They'd rather hurt minorities instead helping everyone.   100%. obsessed actually look analyze statistics.  Everyone going go economic depression US absolutely fail, basically complete failure across board, left right.

My posts defense US handled this, garbage, fact we, global society, addressed overall risk poorly.

Africa starving now. global economy teetering brink collapse. We've rolled back almost 40 years gains global poverty. address virus proven deadly mostly people already ill elderly. Even potential long term effects toying system prone failure even good times gambling outcome save lives killed virus wont end destroying rest world.

If everyone could like Sweden we'd mess now. trick establishing new normal ASAP. Sweden better every western country terms overall quality life post virus. us don’t. work contractor come work facility. telling thinks politicians selling fear shouldn’t anything it’s hoax.

Needless say doesn’t work us anymore. wants personal life. threatening lives employees

For fellow Americans think fake. cost job. No... need burn own, real dearh certificate Anti science minority?  Based what?  Anytime go anywhere seems obvious people ignoring science. also *want* destroy country, “If can’t prosper minimal effort, one prosper all” sentiment, also literally *want bring biblical end times.*

They formally considered enemies America. none happen America. go way massive countries: Russia China. Dictatorship corporations ruling class. People fell Trump's specific brand anti-science bullshit minority, unfortunately, anti-science beliefs general much not.

Look many people left believe GMOs ""chemicals"" dangerous, organic food safer/healthier conventional, ""alternative"" medicine works, forth.

People believe whatever confirms pre-existing beliefs. funny people reddit attack landlords(in cases justified people leveraging themselves) never talk real issue. 

The banks entire system. 

*blah blah landlords evil/greedy blah blah*

I'm pretty sure times probably want independent landlord negotiate bank billions dollars + lawyers retainer want evict you. Don’t worry covid come long term effects damage lungs blood clots, wont live long recover. one reason think I’m person school ridiculous right now. students need consistency-I provide remote teaching. can’t school-out school-in school-out school! even chews anymore. swallow apple whole let stomach acid digesting. actually makes feel little better. ""nearly everyone it!""

\*gives insanely huge range potential number cases, extrapolates hospital residents overall population\* Sauce celebrity dies. That's happens leader polarizes every issue. quarantine started, everyone cool President Chaos went TV said ""OPEN THINGS UP!"" debating effectiveness masks, went TV said ""DON'T WEAR MASKS!""

President Trump literally trying kill many people possible, supporters cheering on. people choice. old. I'm talking people young, actively reject 200+ years hard science, teach children same. people shred sympathy for. 

This getting us nowhere. said opinion matter, free disagree. going circles point. Great time opening schools September... Hard disagree conclusion. rural areas are, *do* hang out, everyone hangs together spot. hospital capacity back up. going pretty. even arguing point? never said would stop said won’t get 300k Dec wouldn’t get 1 million deaths. supported available data available moment. try compromise, still good enough Republicans. Compromise mean get everything point, honestly, don’t even feel bad. Everyone knows needs done refuse it. sucked, never want go thru took precautions necessary. you’re anything it, fuck it, deserved it. lots love people U.S. think we've touted idea freedom much whenever someone suggests something, take personal offense opposite. patriotism downfall.  curious people put India list. Even lot media reports US ignore them. country realistically competing USA Brazil. voluntary times, mean wont get punished obeying mostly people, one forces work. read outlying cases. race might make work since prison gangs like lazy folks cant fight. gangs make sleep shoes fight moments notice. American cares deeply, really sucks. Thankful live reasonably compliant city. Even we're get rocked gazillion returning college students month. Fuck it, every trial needs it’s sacrifices, it. Here’s hoping sacrifice time comes helps later. didn’t accomplish much maybe something help humans later on. Well, rather denominator small. 1/2 greater 1/200. Stereotype much? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Even anti-maskers know stupid. Sunday times joke got reported. ignoring key factors exposure time quality air circulation store. 


You're usually going store long enough enough sustained exposure catch it.  I'm sure dead now. thought 3% Yeah, except one one data point galan77 used. analysis used confirmed cases conservative multiplier health officials pitched leads similar conclusion.

We know 5% NYC tested positive COVID. percentage think tested - especially testing rationed NYC's peak? tried paying people maybe 3 grand stay fuck home 5 weeks? Cause would work. cheaper upfront, lead stronger, quicker recovery. though. true. go almost nowhere. do, wear mask. work home, might go office maybe 1 hour week less, like 3-5 people there.

Well, last time went office, learned one people roommate positive, wearing mask office.

So despite extensive efforts avoid infection, came uncomfortably close exposure. mean - won’t exactly rushing get it. want one would rather go healthcare vulnerable first. wait. Spanish flu entire native communities Alaska northern Canada wiped completely. wise avoid generational (eg exposure certain disease younger age), genetic? difference people? seem awfully upset someone pointing reality situation. metric shows NY good job completely fabricated. Investigations need launched nursing home massacre. Fools! know things virus cause? Even recover left variety symptoms including extremely exhausted point need stimulant drugs make function, joint pain, that's tough one. 58 percent people spent day immense fatigue would change mind immediately unfortunately many mentality ""I feel fine"" Last heard US CDC figure said death rate 4.7%. course that’s amongst tested diagnosed. I’m assuming USA lot people get COVID-19 never get tested can’t afford it. death rate reported countries 2-3%. telling current oxford vaccine exact one one? Yes... read mine? temporarily? pandemic stops? Cmon. It’s getting started. Every dispensary overpriced considering grow lbs organic buds 70 days $300.

All need closet, $300 access internet. It’s human point, innocent rock. Like, grow human cells shape heart make beat, doesn’t make cells human person. normal flu,not bad tb influenza.

""Flu"" *IS* Influenza. 

Good lord, people get dumber? US pop 132 mil 1940. Also way faster show symptoms way easier detect infrared camera airport. 

But yeah, virus pretty awful mix contagious deadly.  Dems need run ad shows chart deaths rising time presidents words playing go up. 

""It is"" change school safety measures prevent flu deaths. Everyone schools required turn proof vaccination medical exemption form. someone get flu close classroom week deep clean prevent spread. people wear masks flu symptoms, school everywhere Forget Pledge Allegiance, probably brought praying every morning great leader whole family get tough times. virus knows truly loyal. /s Liberals hypocritical, gullible puppets earth. keep following MSM Pied Piper I’m sure virus take care using face mask, face shield, gloves, minimum, risking life. Hopefully, carry sanitizer them. testing mostly done private corporations, charge tests even backlogged 7+ days. Medical theater. backlogs could solved insurance/government payed nothing test results come within 48 hours.

In Asian cultures, value collectivism much slightly individualism. Whereas America individualistic country earth. Australia comes close. can’t get daycare lose jobs longer health insurance money essential things take risk charged neglect leaving child home alone you’re anxious, try gummies 1:1 ratio THC:CBD. small doses available (2mg) well. point hopefully people realize matter cities states. city going need number. That's going take long time much country, happened lot places. Ok dunno

How feel influenza? #1 cause death children. Guess virtual preschool on. it’s new way racist without using n-word. They’ll always find way, ignore them. Wow. 6 months ago “so? It’s China, stop fear mongering”.

Then Italy. New York.

Now you’ve given “it’s everywhere”.

The point kinda AVOIDABLE. actually took action day one, wouldn’t deaths have, economy wouldn’t nearly bad, etc etc etc.

But nooooo gotta stop fear mongering. know this! NerdWallet collected ton data prove Hey, I'm student high school, let say administration intentions closing school. lot us terrified lives administration refuses anything fuck talking about??? fuck changed???

You full shit think schools could reopen safely could sports.

No one immunity. vaccine.

Deal it. Yes, thank goodness dangers society us. went school sheltered country burb practically gang activity, would enforce weird-ass rules like that. town part meth-land lots gang activity :) gatekeepers pointed medical educational privacy laws reasons withhold even basic counts coronavirus cases. That’s despite federal guidance saying laws aren’t barriers disclosure legal experts note schools share information *as long don’t identify individuals.*

Exactly. easily report new cases. Yes is. called contact tracing testing. Hey stock market Average Joe Alabama obviously zero issues. Many repeat follow tests. think shortage tests yet mass testing time? Nope. president cronies getting daily tests, athletes. Every person tested positive likely one follow test confirm. People prisons hospitals nursing homes get tests, sometimes many. also need tests public catch light/asymptomatic. even close 19% tested even had, covers one moment time. need mass testing get control done. New Zealand went 100 days detectable community transmission. German states coronavirus regulations. See last question. NSW state imposed border closure neighboring Victoria state, since literally entire point federalist system give states rights. states set coronavirus regulations.

Sure, compared 48.2%, 46.1% smaller, call ""minority"" disingenuous.

In real life notice roughly half people dumb. Half ""minority"". look ways crossing street? Good let americans carry stupid Yes  American:

S.O.S. noticed young-20s neighbor mowing lawn, mask on. He's awhile. even needed? mean, he's himself, yard. rides tractor mask on. 

I thought masks needed stores crowded area outdoors. situation one might need wear mask is? grew conservative Christian home. Like, GOP party GOD Christian; like church 4 days week homeschooled Christian. remember asking brother kill could go see Jesus. 7 so. 14 — said yes. Glad chickened out. far left really exist appreciable capacity country. Stop falling boogeyman every intelligence agency current DOJ even admits exist. communist memes Reddit count.

Oh no, CARE...its shitty leaders act like big deal, additude trickles small bit idiot public dumb impressionable... Guess hot tail. Peace big groups IQ also pretty dogshit politicians care. Half population care. us care really amount actually make difference. Seriously we'd rather sacrifice elderly children inconvenience even second. That's happens politicians care two things. Money one upping side. population people care less anyone else ""freedoms"". Michigander here. frightening surrounded clueless morons horribly contagious infectious disease simultaneously. Please know many us care.

I hard time walking door drive work every day, get like alternative reality. Management warpath everything except pandemic. People maskless everywhere, reason they're allowing plastic face shields. protection.

My boss wears construction mask exhaust valve. says ""we let infect everyone"". 

People take face shield set carry around, they're completely unprotected since can't made wear masks, even though executive order necessitating requiring use state. 

There's singular, widely approved message responsibility safety. expectation might catch give everyone come contact with. may die. may die. that's fine them...

My face covered collar bones bridge nose two cloth layers, medical mask top cloth ones. wear goggles everywhere keep eyes. ordered $150 disposable single use masks re-using getting risky.

I've grocery store times 4 months. Everywhere go coronavirus main topic discussion. Yet, like joke people here. employer enforces nothing. I've edge sanity months week worse one came it. Nazis socialists name, argument?

Lol no, confusion website. understanding there's national guard that's federally run, seems local deployments across states. guess entice someone join give kind benefits college tuition, state dependent, guess get state dependent benefits joining national guard. 

I'll spend time researching specific connections things. Good points though. friend lives Prague, they’re literally traveled Germany Italy past couple weeks went multiple bars restaurants countries. wear mask trains transportation. Europe pretty much open awhile. That''s stupid sentiment covid hoax. Roman downward spiral 😔😔😔 started like r/killthosewhodisagree , then.. sure, let something happen changes minds. pretty well established GOP Russia working together. That's became part GOP playbook. Nah couldn’t it. It’s fLu bro Damn, live Vegas missed ! Would loved opposite side idiocy. bad still believe science personally responsible avoiding gatherings size.

Fucking embarrassing. really sucks country’s culture pure individualism. don’t care nothing anyone else long get pandemic exposed it. Sad thing it’s illegal asshole. kill Hitler baby? *makes strangling motion* You’d surprised much Americans give rather admit wrong. Uhh yeah, let's praise idioits idiots. given amount people recovered covid vs number even rumors reinfections, less 0.1% get reinfected, all. already covid-19, fairly safe. No, cited first thing confirms point, without broader understaning. 3.2% people test positive coronavirus die. many, many people covid19 dont get tests, mild symptoms asymptomatic. denominator John's Hopkins uses ifr lower actual count people 'rona.

Notice blame John's hopkins, they're clear numbers mean. Blame spouting without understandung. think is. chemicals get dumped waterways, etc. Ahh, can't even subject. I've said I'll say again.

We need sort opt registry people.

We can't force wear masks stop clogging medical facilities people taking seriously use garbage exc still wearinguse selfishness. in-laws afraid die it, figure go time. BUT, selfish assholes still social distancing wearing masks go out.

My mother already it, still wearing mask chance could still carry it. People can't smallest things garbage. Two months pregnant, 6 months started spreading significantly U.S.. sound like best country offer. stupid is, stupid does. priveleged

^^^BEEP ^^^BOOP ^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^bot. ^^^PM ^^^me ^^^to ^^^contact ^^^my ^^^author.  ""But mah freedom"" /r/Coronavirusobesity FDA approves vaccines use US. Québec I'm sorry Florida Canada. I'm ashamed province Well, read removed context church, sure ya guess reads little weird. Lol save climate? useless fair, one wanted us either. That’s made us uniquely American, amirite? Hell, even half America doesn’t want half America vice versa. Sweden also way better health care stigma ill, would mean anyone feeling ill wouldn’t go work despite might broke payday. Look rates Lombardy versus every region country. Expectations efficacy vaccine overall penetration resulting vaccination campaign vary wildly we're trying predict future something we've never done before. 

Fauci says expects vaccine around 75% effective optimistic estimate. government head [US vaccine development said expects 90% higher. Obviously vaccine 50% going amazingly helpful, extremely wide range possibilities.

Similarly, mention [this 42% respondents said planned get vaccine. However, [this one three *wouldn't* get vaccine. That's quite large shift still 20 percentage points. 

A 40% effective vaccine delivered 30% Americans would create 12% population immunity. 90% effective vaccine delivered two-thirds Americans would create 60% population immunity, nearly enough general population immunity near total suppression virus. 

I think point rather hanging expert opinion polling projections shop we're probably going better mentally assume vaccine coming it'll big help. big help we're sure. we're lucky may end whole pandemic. may also need prepared continue supplementing basic health measures like masks good hand hygiene better treatments prophylactics invented another year two road. Ironic, it? worst part pandemic hitting black &amp; brown communities 50% twice hard white counterparts. back many white Americans' minds, there's notion they're relatively safe since health problem that's mainly affecting colored ppl.

So seriously think white people looking around saying ""Ope, looks like blacks affected, us whites must safe!"" stupid take lol. Less week suspending student took original pic upset implied school wasn’t safe.   Oxford Group even US!  No, don’t. Lol, fuck said would 2 weeks? Even March? priveledged

(Small business person here). Downvote ..don't give fuck..its true regardless WH.  Time it. 

Most world also astonished many say 'it's minority' obviously case. know that's true. large number asymptomatic cases may mean large percentage effectively immune people begin with. love people even realize privileged are.

""Can find beforehand taking another week...""

Well job gets paid vacations. can't single mother working 2 fast food jobs take week off? fault, really.

and eyes rolling back head.

Please never ever jury rape case. want know wearing? Oh right too! know Germany particular look favipiravir COVID context. AFAIK, Germany authorized it. FDA not. know test cases would right? read manuals. mean Sweden much same.

Craziness boundaries. Ita testing more.
/s Astonished? 

In terms surprise? No, really

In terms impressed? Yeah, astonishing greatly fucked Canadian states visiting family. confirm, care! Yeah, good luck finding evidence google, company love China censors truth trying get Biden elected taking money dems / China. 95% media anti truth misleading bs. History rewritten. dig it. Fact-check.org might well CCP state media far I’m concerned record bias. 

From actual live reporting I’ve seen actual first hand knowledge false reportings, they’ve mostly (but entirely) suppressed, it’s pretty obvious something nefarious going way worse Covid 19. believe government want. They’ve never lied before. mean totally impossible itw one hell gamble take.

If large part population already immune likley means coronaviruses give cross immunity. phenomon basis vaccine discovered *impossible*

But said, would hell gamble. Many us care, unfortunately enough get rest US care. suffer look foolish result. Sadly know people took religious approach virus literally said get part plan. also said die time know they're going. could barely believe heard. Sure. could see another wave. natural consequence opening lockdown. 

The thing bugs total surprise agencies governments infections rise opening up, putting blame second wave. 

A five year old could forecast increase. 

I think wave concept first used Spanish flu. autumn 1918, flu virus came back populations communities eliminated months before. aggressive strain virus. (If misunderstood this, please correct me. I’m expert Spanish flu, 1918 version). 

The situation today Spain countries different. spread slowed down, present community along. 

If New Zeeland would another outbreak, would ok calling second wave though. nothing returning school. whats funny first weeks outbreak, many schools policy shutting 1 positive case. months later yolo mode Mayor talks lot highly unlikely anything COVID patient right hematoma covering half body. surgical resident following along inevitable happens - skin starts become necrotic. hate virus much. 

Also, interestingly MASSIVE uptick acute cholecystitis (gall bladder inflammation) acute appendicitis people fitting normal clinical picture. Part wonders it’s virus related. 

Yes practice Florida. would time activate super weapon hid Statue Liberty, please. thought children almost immune COVID-19 president said. Reading thread, kinda understand they're coming from. Everyone quick pin death covid zero evidence covid involved. Nobody wants wait autopsy see preexisting heart condition always going kill him. hard take people seriously they're quick jump conclusions. Every single know spouts line last several months *exactly* type person. crying constitutional rights, big conspiracy theories making big to-do they're standing freedom. 

I like refer ""garbage-people"". 9?!?!?!? plz send help Happy cake day! makes think sudden care anyone's health take steos protect anyone!? /s Irish citizenship comes added EU citizenship there's too! There's much truth that. hurts. sure is... is. realize Europe almost twice population US, right? Blind patriotism immune corona It’s Europe, course it’s nearly severe. Also helps countries much smaller US overall. naturally lockdown helped lot, US poor lockdown drastic effect. Regardless, many countries still cases Western Europe, Germany spike recently France highest daily cases past week.  Every time scream ""There's god idiot"" face, complicit letting people die. 

 

If educated people less polite, now. matter president then..we've ready deal situation point. sourced way much product battle it. say want DT, America First battle exactly happening last 20 years last 4.  sad answer “no, don’t care. even annoyed inconvenienced manner.” 

Ugh.... United States Apathy guys seem like sane rational people. see stuff news social media; know, “Karen’s”, conspiracy nuts, people shout “liberal” drop hat, MAGA people, guys...”embarrassed” become, somewhat “the face America?”  also straight GOP play book. GOP using racial tensions win elections trying bankrupt social welfare programs decades. nothing new even Russia taking action stoke flames, fire already roaring Americans' actions begin with. Trump wins second term, would yall let chill Europe? fewer deaths World. Winning It’s supporters blame unfortunately, even close. can’t even wrap head what’s going right country I've seen good bad both. staff taking masks stores closed. Totally stupid. I've seen complete departments co.e covid19, hazmat teams come scrub departments. morans fail realize, stores 1-2 time clocks. mask come till I'm car. Sigruts? even letting us in? Come fuck people close fucking borders us ASAP get sorted far I’m aware current mentality “the flue kills people per year” “it’s 99.7% survival rate, it’s nothing” That's case universally know it. Yet cases associated protests. would seem spread associated indoors outdoors. worst part belief they'll never know wrong, best part, depending perspective. sure Dems totally incompetent. guys made good headway healthcare Dems, Vets well it, too. made good headway jobs &amp; economy, too. Sadly disease that’s currently WH taking credit good stuff did. politics turns tyranny and/or violence, wrong side whichever side shoots first absolutely nowhere go. many people left believe GMOs ""chemicals"" dangerous, organic food safer/healthier conventional, ""alternative"" medicine works, forth.

i seen evidence prelevant left, got sources? US schools: ""Hold beer!"" Natural selection viruses much faster natural selection say, people, millions person life span much shorter. country finished. mean, first reaction was, ""why would anyone that?"" remembered. 2020, Trump inexplicably squatting oval still. Smh. we're order magnitude, talk that.

No, injustice crying heaven.

Are reasons lawfully justified - so, there's ways comply change raising awareness voting whoever wants vote addressing issue.

Are reasons completely random, wrongful:
Can find beforehand taking another week presidential election ensure cast vote properly, process fight stop happening addressing parties willing vote cast vote accordingly?

Why that? hard uncomfortable unfair us now? Literally, that's us mountain dead bodies starting millennia ago ""Na, much, I'm good whatever."" US ready regardless president now, 20 years ago.
Just ready due amount people sourcing products needed battle it. blows mind greedy wealthy people are. bezos money could ever spend lifetime. doesn’t need wealth. could much good. could fix Flint, Michigan’s water issue even bank account feel it. could buy equipment PPE struggling hospitals. There’s shit-ton could do. But... mean? Hygiene Theater.

Disinfecting much breathers return breathe covid19 next time, crowed hallways, classrooms. Nobody astonished here, thats fat lie. dont get tested enough literally clueless. agree predictions making explicitly transition period time immediately following referendum, that's correct english man would agree would insert meme cant  They’re near herd immunity. requires 70%+ population get infected even haven’t proven long term immunity yet. talk around T-cells antibodies haven’t long lasting, especially mild asymptomatic cases. might right that. sister said one. said ""sorry, hang up..."" Step 1, brother go TV praise you.

Step 2, send sick people nursing homes.... Also note US, many workers benefit/getting paid staying home sick. Therefore many continue work meanwhile sick spread virus. 
And second note, US many people hesitant visit hospitals medical attention shit expensive. Therefore even spreading virus risking others.  
US really bad majority people lives paycheck paycheck. Also NY (LI) I’ve heard conflicting things young kids masks (last heard teacher friend new guideline recommending everybody age 2 wear one), agree - you’re public there’s potential around even one person, **wear damn mask**. still don’t know know virus! 

I cannot comprehend *thing* that’s literally size index card became big deal. hardship, exactly? mean, people willingly microwave $800 smart phones, *this* tests limits science? Half countries world histories revolution **same** country USA revolted against. Lysol stay surfaces forever nothing air. Sick kids right back Wednesday infect aren't. mean state hosting whole fucking NBA state out-of-state tourists right lot cases? well i'lll damned

and they're still behind california total cases Interesting. tested positive, obviously reported testing positive. I've reading, state deals voluntarily provided data them. example, could state require opt providing personal information state? would cut false positive reporting. Americans need care first. families nation . Maybe heal opioids rampant alcohol abuse. actually care. are. website gave universal states, logo bottom saying ""United States National Guard""? Well serious apologize insulting you. looked like missed sarcasm immediately resorted calling guy Trumper. reddit all, one step Twitter. many people know tested positive? Okay. mean...no, magic formula.

You close like should. is. second link work.

The first link say anything skipping clinical trials. mentions possibility accepting vaccine lower efficacy might usually consider. say might approve vaccine 50% efficacy. Nothing skipping trials determine efficacy safety.

Sorry reread post mention skipping trials. mention lowering safety standards. provided evidence that. Yeah maybe pink unicorn comes along solves problems. weird thing is, far scientific data-based sister subreddit, almost everyone extremely pro-vax, vaccines particular, people reading actual data. people read data - going feelings politics.  They'll close Saturday Sunday Millions individual Americans care. US *as country*, though? Nope, one bit. We're fucked. wear mask dude It’s daughter, it’s people she’ll infect go back normal. Many people pre-existing conditions younger 65, ignoring that, say good luck everyone 65 reopen? God doesn’t want people act stupid get killed could prevented.  Lol that's politicians ever worked... guess could say hope none less..

Thats deaths us!

Dont care Europe? smug clearly test less deaths? misleading drivel?! Honestly seen massive change mask behaviors recently work I’m outside it’s night day Cool, elbow-bump tongue. don’t know many times I’ve wanted raise voice someone like wear fucking mask properly idiot. I’ve seen many people dangle one ear walking around inside department store like why? wear properly 15 mins you’re ass hat reddit, though, solution lockdown forever. [WHO supports promoting video games covid, AVOID going doctor. IIRC there's increase still births/miscarriages likely attributed women experiencing issues they'd normally go doctor avoid fear getting covid. feel need go doctor please it, especially Canada. Oh live Florida. Prime stupid grounds. condolences fellow Floridian. hate here. still think way early open schools again. Agree. too! thank heavens people less cynical still trying. Except, pictures show many (if most) protesters masks. not. think people wearing masks huge issue many countries already enforced it, instead leaving people? people get sick, virus particles floating around ear surfaces, harder avoid getting sick. Masks 100% effective, especially way people wear - still touching mask thee hands without sanitising first, wearing mask longer hours, even reusing masks without washing them, etc. many people still unconsciously rub eyes sometimes? takes one unlucky time. countries trying get many people wear masks possible. public health issue. people diligently wearing masks washing hands still died. Nurses especially. Viral load matters too. might want read this. I’m sure got info without masks true. person incapable empathy conscience psychopath definition.  I'm using app thing app manipulated.
Anyone download thing click YES I've tested positive troll others way anyone going go so. Like many said, almost shame virus isnt lethal. was, people would actually taken seriously, less net deaths damage. Instead, bad enough, allowed thrive part lives going forward top Australian doctors told us kids immune. one talking money. Well that's one way reduce America's carbon footprint damn dirty liberals stoop anything perpetrate hoax. flabbergasted.

When done testing get one her. meantime worth risk; keep quarantined to. SUSPENDED HER. 

The took back hell. cases count positives ? Beats me, sounds like loud extended farting me..... politics feels good instead actually works? 2 kids here, scheduled go back another month. Honestly sure make go first month see goes. low rates Toronto sounds horrible. can't expect young kids touch face school masks required age. think least end year distance learning pain ass worse risking lives. local university webcams every classroom infrastructure broadcast classes multiple ways. Yet, forging ahead person semester. Ya, woman children bomb sure huge threats us. Gotta send kids somewhere mommy daddy go work make people rich I’m absolutely accounting non tested cases.

But wait... anti-vaxers interested.  


So, no. Sadly. We're stuck misery long time. dum dums, Well biker gangs across US probably decrease now..... mom gave extra $20 I'm much better off. Many parents retirement funds, savings, life insurance funds work question. us kids various issues delays we, parents, can't deal help with, needs addressed professionals... person, especially younger kids can't handle online classes, parents can't monitoring child day even work home.

We asked school district choose class online school coming fall. deliberation weighing pros cons decided would put risk ensure child care needs. I'm sure many parents find situation opt in-class instruction despite reservations. Get well! usual safety processes vaccines gone through...? I'm getting politcal dude. People get $400 extra bucks next week would gotten $0. wonder 16% number works. example, 3 kids vaccinated, probably won’t getting future vaccines. 16% parents 16% people antivax? we've spent years years shitting experts science. outcome. people working mean people scared them. unfortunate understandable essential workers risking health keep shit failing apart even more.

Now people essential workers,who NEED risk resuming usual activity. I.E schools &amp; sports. them,it simply safe. sentiment going. “It is.” ... due common sense. accept anti-mask.

Second, money coming FEMAs disaster relief budget. Right hurricane season approaching. one fund plunder, feels like good candidate.

Thirdly, likely illegal reallocate funds like since Congress controls purse. least surely legally challenged tied court. state unemployment office, going send +$400 checks funds backing may wind vapor? course not, one going get paid anytime soon anyway.

The Dems passed Heroes back May Trump McConnel sat ass week CARES provisions expired come garbage plan side even agree Trump throws hail mary unexecutable EO.

But sure, another round applause Trump usual definitely injecting situation making much worse. Np!! “It is.” theyre getting tired complacent virus hasnt hitten close home yet...... Except Nordic countries followed proper guidelines selfish completely disregard well-being fellow citizens end 5m confirmed case 160k deaths like America. grand scheme things losing year 2 school matters not.  


They catch later life.  Plus, understandings generation school kids later life.  get fine.  


Keep em' school. live. Good luck, fellow Redditor. math poor. Youre accounting non-tested cases. IFR % = (# deaths / # infected) x 100. 5 million confirmed = # infected. even close. wife sold life insurance. large part job going people's homes, explaining coverage that.

Completely denying potential risks one first ones taking vaccine idiotic.

And ""At Risk"" category disease idiot taking vaccine got albeit rushed Phase III. That's strange way interpret it.... set end week without anything Congress. would 0, 400. Hopefully Congress actually passes something soon. 3 people could *see* facing away camera. Shocking. gonna make go school, least pack science class.  Yeah, hard lesson... taking seriously saw maybe like 3 people state started opening (I’m CA .. Orange County land masks). shock told didn’t confront next day. Haven’t talked since end June. still shock. It’s really hard Orange County. one takes seriously feel crazy. capitalism? 

That makes sense regards little kids, high schoolers. They're perfectly capable taking care taking virtual classes parents go work. Denial river Africa. End already. Ah damn. start gofundme him? lot work vaccines prior coronaviruses large part reason going able get vaccine developed faster.  like started scratch here. we've known since April.  dictate terms? congress for? wrong. article says 3,000. 300,000 ton people never even knew it. way it’s 5%  teachers idiots too.. hmm... bodes well future. America finished ... this. close friend Nathan Mhyrvold published lot material, Gates support, global viral threats. Maybe /u/SrGrafo might find interesting challenge way contribute. I'm vaccines. 

One rushed like scares me. I'd love worry getting COVID, yeah. going lie, idea getting vaccine put usual safety process freak little. 

Again, sure thing freaks more: getting spreading virus risking death long term effects; basically worry vaccine. 🤷 Stay hospital get sick keep immediate family out, too. Thanks. 3 people wore masks entire crowded hallway. Anything 100% idiocy safety point view. Put aside financial political reasons moment. COVID-19 asymptomatic many people incubation period 14 days. takes one person highly populated place like college campus spread like wildfire. think college students going sit hands downtime? every single student going wear mask outside class dutifully maintain physical distance? takes handful assholes—and US seems abundance right now—to turn category 5 cluster fuck. hope I'm wrong. College football gonzo. NFL next. shit, that's wrote ""I dream"" :P Well I’m really trying go anyone, trying possibilities explored, appears one It’s mentality sure. country would brag dumb shit, wear hats like “back back World War Champs”. Trump exactly US deserved brain dead ideals. It’s pessimism. It’s reality.

It’s gonna take long wish take. It’s gonna take long takes leaders get heads asses get shit done. US garbage job, opening schools dooming us potentially years virus. absolutely fear going vacation. Literally everytime I've used leave extended period, always results type negative repercussions. See, issue American leaders actually political agenda is, country they're from. doesn’t know pharma works he? yet.. somehow... people made bad guy. People fucking nuts. amount shit average person believes frightening. I’m talking 10-15% certifiably nuts America... average people. know nurse who's anti-vaxer COVID denier. wish kidding.  left job end 2019 job basically taken new management, transferred 100 miles away, take transfer leave. left. needed break anyhow, taking months spend kids clear head, thinking could look new job beginning 2020. Obviously things changed. I'm single parent two kids, masters Engineering, still can't find job places actually hiring want office, even though 90% usually remotely.

So I'm stuck. could stick kids school form daycare (pretty much breaking regulation supposed allowed right now), way I'm that. literally linked linked ignored best available evidence countries opened schools indicates COVID-19 poses low risks school-aged children, least areas low community transmission

Stop pretending like advocating listening science selectively ignore parts inconvenient you. amazing killing way. Amazing. number reflects kids whose parents actually took tested, realistically number larger Calm down, french hanged kings years ages, americans one civil war still thrilled. They’re stupid...they don’t care ~0,035% mortality rate highly risky? Eat healthy, life healthy u fine. state (in Australia) we’ve closed whole schools someone tested positive. Sometimes it’s 24 hours deep clean, close contacts (including students/teachers) quarantine 2 weeks. weekend they’ve announced one whole senior school closed 2 weeks quarantine second positive case found. could know? US residents complain constantly Reddit. think joking? serious problem. Many us emigrate US refuse live shitty lives. even plan outlined above, deal that. Kids parental support home could part exception (or pseudo-exception, maybe parents swing 1-2 days week home lighten load, employer named-and-shamed flexible like everyone else be).

All could accounted for, Trump polarized like everything else. He's literal cancer society. honestly crazy trust government? SARS 2002 SARS today. getting stories entire families wiped students day now. ""I'm mommy"" look, heavens knows moms afraid boogies. economic impacts COVID deaths? talk hospitals collapsing, etc, reality require baseline economic services well. Americaned Gweneth Paltrow Andrew Wakefield could understand ignoring COVID-19 climate change favor safer universe, they're perfectly willing terrified minds fantasies rampaging anti-fascists, illegal immigrants, baby-killing liberal Democrats.  I'm actually sure point comment is. schools planning go back things way were. Every one I'm familiar altered operates significantly. inspected intestines sacrificed goat quite intently. nothing indicating plague. know else could done?! man get enough credit good does. thing is, He’s good probably care They’re likely mutate weaker stronger. apples cost $9.99/lb become extinct.

Slave labor subsidizes many products across north america.

More broadly consider things like diamonds, chocolate oil.

These thing exist, least anywhere near current price point without heavy subsidies form virtual slave labor, imperialist wars control production. regulations like farm subsidies. regulate corn products food supply prop corn farmers. many cases regulations problem. Even then, spread adults family risk. must stupid consider that. mean dehuminize innocent lives, government think good idea long term? long term health costs survivors going crippling next decade. friend middle school teacher. School opening week. 140 students. expected sanitize classroom class. teach students classroom virtual learning also janitor too. report cop! They're endangering others. mean, first time, still... Yeah I've thought that, religious. I've definitely heard pretty good arguments it, can't get board yet. Mainly believe Antichrist supposed come power essentially ushering peace uniting people.

But is, unfortunately what's happening. 

(Not unfortunate he's Antichrist, unfortunate he's promoting driving peace throughout society) love pokemon go. care. people realized spreads, greater chance mutation? could become deadly point worst outcome possible believe they're saying conservatives bothered the, ""If like leave"", narrative Obama president. tell ya 🤤That’s instruction manual. Here... probably read too:
Yes, great time everyone self reliant... means generating electricity, filtering water, growing food. Unless that, relying essential workers need move around country filled virus cases people selfish. god forbid catch bad case covid can't breathe, plan self reliant go hospital? fair, forecast says 300k *by* December, means 300k above. CDC hospitalization rate hospitalizations / total population, hospitalizations / cases. I've seen error made alot disinformation posts. What's real fun take vacation one job go work overtime second job. 😀 think black white. Kids need socialize function parts society.

That's happening fall, period. Sitting desks 6 feet apart, wearing masks, contact activities...the social aspect school going basically agree remote first makes sense, time need find ways socialize kids, otherwise they're going concept functioning society like post-COVID. wish struck balance regard, instead ignored problem said nothing.

Ironically, done remote-first keep large groups gathering together schools, absolutely could small groups friends playing outside school, setting time groups come week physical interaction. Instead, we've tried force schools open, they'll quickly close teachers/parents/family start dying, that. We'll left hacked-together, second-class remote learning option, kids get zero quality education back full quarantine.

This terrible plan, worst possible outcome. people demanded it. Totally surprised this. Correct Fuck employers impatience. shows total ignorance fuck bosses understand what's going on? makes realize many sociopaths run society. Thank you! child came out. heard worse horriblesquirts selfish asshole friend could likely super spreader. Anyone symptoms ought quarantining themselves, especially waiting test. since tests least 20% chance false negative, even case negative result, people symptoms ought quarantine. Ask Karen someone hose power washer, telling laced mucus drained corona lungs. april wife working retail able stay home, faced difficult decision kids (4 7) stay grandma 3 weeks. supposed 'peak' mom properly quarantine watching kids couple days week. Well realized going short quarantine decision got even harder, long kids stay there? seeing stupid impossible. Wife ended work lot less stimulus helped make possible her. became unaffordable june working hours, sign waiver saying longer full-time, subject whatever hours could give her....

Now August. lease 22 days, landlord going RAISE FUCKING RENT move. board educators said school would return person waive white flag, governor declared online learning return. survive, working harder ever kids stronger lived all.

Fuck corona. Fuck trump. Fuck politicians take breaks figuring livelihood. Fuck covid deniers, anti mask anti vax fuckheads needed bars salon's open cause 'bored' co-workers sweatin bullets worried one another became sick.

CFR children age 15 greater 1/400 (since age sets m&lt;5), ~.2%. course, IFR going lower. group probably way undercounted compared groups, biasing CFR upwards. Also, includes newborns separate category, might shift things bit upwards well. 

You throw everyone 25 still CFR higher 1/1088, roughly .0919% (that's right, 12 people age 25 died coronavirus Utah). least 15-24 probably closer accurate case count (though likely still large undercount). Interestingly, CFR 25-44 ~.059, ~1/1668, slightly lower 25 CFR. probably represents accurate case counts adults children. 

Utah also gives hospitalization rates. Including newborns makes 15 hospitalization rate ~1.3%. Without them, .963% (roughly 1 104). course 120x rate given CDC. think childhood cases undercounted I'm sure we're missing *that* many cases, I'm sure going here. I'd definitely trust CDC back napkin calculations though. better data importantly, people trained estimate properly. Yes, great time everyone self reliant... means generating electricity, filtering water, growing food. Unless that, relying essential workers need move around country nownfilled virus cases people selfish. god forbid catch bad case covid can't breathe, plan self reliant go hospital? Even beyond requirement factor, fair equally say ""Every business declared essential work required pay workers employed company year pandemic- including people left pandemic due furlough, quitting, fired- get vaccine released. they're really essential workers, pay able safe work."" /r/highereducation grim reading lots us field. 

Its gonna blood bath next years Myocarditis involves changes muscle permanent. real cluster fuck going start October(The beginning flu season). School starting going keep COVID numbers high till it'll ripe explode. children spread adults family higher risk dying numbskull. Thank you! can’t believe forgot movie. someone please tell surprised? How’d got it? think misunderstood me. pointing obvious - magical gate holds virus back unless spend 15 minutes near someone go within certain distance.

There continue countless examples guidelines shifting WELL people become infected following “all” protocols... sadly, including Asia Europe.

I masks distancing, extremely strict household. think false comfort think 5 minute, 7 foot away exposure means someone safe.

It’s arbitrary, based extremely ancient science, given new unknown deadly possible disabling disease, I’m going pretend moment 6 feet 15 mins sort magic panacea. Maybe, maybe, lot people believe vaccines reason believe father claimed used elephant repellent keep elephants away house western New York.

Most people seen polio whooping cough measles. easy believe vaccines effective. Perhaps resistance talking vaccine crumble neighbor, mother, spouse taken hospital.

Sabinada happened Bahia state (not Amazon) lasted months. weapons time highly doubt thousand people could died.

Balaiada lasted 3 years, killed 30.000. simple Google search would suffice. sWeDeN Jerk, feel one best movies, definitely timeless classic. would love in-home sewing lessons since still cannot figure I'm wrong threading machine, browsing subreddit always changes mind. 

Our hospital shut dedicated Covid unit late June. Reactivated late July. Every day code inpatients least one Covid case. I've given expecting people take seriously. Statue begins move. People begin run scream ferries, Statue them. lowers torch begins march water south-westerly direction eventually disappearing waves. wrong. Sweden much worse Nordic countries. look good global level good health care system generally healthy population. think I've seen film like ending. neither school gangs. Good you! wish luck. Sorry hear can't face reality though. This. Never before. This. eyeballs. feel like six year old goes way cough/sneeze directly eyes daily basis.

And animated talks, non-fucking-stop, I'm sprayed spittle day long. mention kids 10 also younger parents. Parents likely mild undocumented cases. Wow. could predicted somehow prevented it. /s also think unlikely make difference. There's way know sure anti-masker sneeze something hour bought it.

Soon enough I'm going need take time since max vacation days accrue coming.

It true high-pay high-stress careers, can't actually use vacation days ""hey Peter, could come day, it'd great."" going comment kids less likely die, probably talking family infect.

This sad. really fucked preventable. people country care much unless affect us, rarely cover country news situation sometime talk total number it.
The reason know country news explore like videos, podcast, random news report channel,...
But can't say ""Karen"" situation happen ot not, damn sure protest anti-mask, vaccine completely stupid.
And think censored, tell like China hiding info public, care image citizen, think HOng Kong protest still happening right now. think black white. Kids need socialize function parts society.

I agree remote first makes sense, time need find ways socialize kids, otherwise they're going concept functioning society like post-COVID. wish struck balance regard, instead ignored problem said nothing. even want eat restaurant pandemic lol economy thanks sacrifice. Here’s study control group you, fren: study, dumbass. press release.
Here article regarding researcher it. investigation falsely promoting FDA sanction 140 person non randomized study. 
www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-md-who-promoted-virus-cocktail-leaving-community-where-he-tested-it/amp/

Your Gates Foundation paranoia tells tin foil hat tight. *also* don’t trust Oxford/NIH - given entities completely unrelated one another - don’t know tell you. Seems like university, public private health system, non profit charity (let alone group them) could fund study without dismissing it. could list another unrelated half dozen I’ve spent enough time this. simply ignorant reason with. sure actual agenda ignoring science promote crap treatments, lucky plenty HCQ available need it. free part thin herd. Maximum dose, way. Good luck. They're country 5 million one least densely populated countries world. hope they're well RUSSIA BAD, NIKITA NATIONAL TREASURE (Maker Escape Tarkov) country’s SUPERIOR testing capabilities. great big Numbers testing. would much less cases virus children tested LESS. Cut back testing ? It’s simple... 5G cannot spread virus. physically impossible.  Okay, I'm going level you: already it, I'm old af, care there's 1... choice 😕 hope assholes get severe cases COVID **don't** recover ~~with new outlook~~.

FTFY They... Yes. government no... First, source. Second, nature link points bunch studies don’t necessarily rely assumed prevalence asymptomatic cases rely antibody testing random sampling testing. First die lol I'd prefer recover. Less likely even selfish stupid shit future alive. crazy society devolved degree people feel offended emboldened enough harass someone wearing mask HOME answering door. delivery person less. Politicized thought processes even defeat basic entry level professionalism. Related question - poor ventilation high ventilation worse virus spread? air stagnant stayed office wouldn’t safest? active hvac system spread virus around more?  5 countries half EU?

Also realize US' fatality rate keeps rising, right? months able use excuse anymore. fact, death count US accurate, deaths per million US would already higher basically EU countries.

Between 1st March 30th May, US 25000 ""non-covid"" excess deaths. pretty obvious total death count US complete bs. remember fools like claimed situation US bad since cases per million MUCH lower countries like Italy. 4 times high. 

The entirety Europe, includes Russia, 331 deaths yesterday. total population countries lot higher US, yet US 996 deaths, 3 times more.

But sure buddy, Europeans bad math.  virus death sentence. everybody equate cases death? 5mm many asymptomatic many minor symptoms. Let thing run course already. No. mired selfishness, ignorance, right wing propoganda.

To fair isnt everyone, enough perpetuate disease. *chuckles* I’m danger! NY, completely agree. wish Cuomo would literally say potato charge.  following closely since early January, around world, IFR seems converging around 0.5% (a bad strain flu comparison around 0.1%). Important note, assumes normal access intensive medical care critical cases. capacity exhausted, rates go dramatically.

Second important point note. person crippled life mind important avoid fatality. know virus significant percentage infected, simply yet know many affected long term, human 8 months. SARS-1 half infected life-long pulmonary fibrosis (serious damage heart) chronic fatigue. important fatality rate. know happening, idea much, unfold long term. 

We over-emphasize deaths easily counted, long term health impairment possibly bigger story. guess meant that, enough people died due Covid, ignore fact hoax. 🎶It must nice, must nice...

To COVID-19. 🎶 Possibly so, hopefully September-October US better state. Public opinion UK school reopenings optimistic US. becomes difficult compare government statements policies two countries think USA always sympathetic Ireland, Ireland want seen letting down. Also **many** American companies European headquarters Ireland, means employment taxes... US ""isn't built deal pandemic"".

FFS. people bother commenting threads even read articles? reiterate wrote first comment here. 

Here's piece February law professor detailing this. fact matter country wide quarantines issued European countries simply worked piece written politicizing lockdowns (before state issued lockdown, back known US negligibly cases)... LAW PROFESSOR specializes public health law, detailing specifically US ill-equipped handle pandemic. 

JFC. Absolutely. you’re right - it’s US, much Reddit wants believe is. US = bad rest world = good. [vomits shoes] He's antivaxer us care, given government completely unwilling what's actually required because, ""Thats socialism!"" lot people choice. either go back work let Karens run amok financially ruined ass. tolerant people putting lives danger tolerant intolerance. ""so much tolerant left"" bullshit straight gas lighting. right, everyone US acts like already.

My friend went beach last week, saw videos posted Snapchat, packed people. Depending state/city in, many restaurants still open. antivax nonsense. concern trolling bullshit extreme honest, difference popular vote what? 1-3 million so.
That means still lots people batshit crazy half population Right Covid-19’s 2.5, gives us 60% threshold. implying “natural R0” vastly higher. You’re obviously making shit idea you’re talking about. nation case.

But Onion always pulls headline every time school shooting happens. They’d die change minds... though, really, go one form thinking another. president small paraeducator union Washington State. overall state educators union fighting hard protections least district, winning. starting on-line, one required building unless ask covid sick leave top normal time. superintendent nervous anyone getting sick blamed extremely cautious. lucky hope stay way. Problem state system. Republicans willfully ignorant. small central government something like happens federal government refer states us do. Others, much. Yeah. People need stop letting *slightly worse flu* control everyone else's lives. Like, someone paranoid afraid 'muh corona', stay fuck home. right ruin lives others force uproot lives one stupid virus. Ah ok, virus European countries land Sweden, Norway, Denmark time amounts, get transferred people amount social mobility? unless case, perhaps judging Sweden versus neighbors besides geogepahy supposed yell ""harder, harder"" want CDC estimate likely wrong due new data coming showing asymptomatic cases far less prevalent previously assumed. Here's problem: know facts were. still completely know.

This **novel** coronavirus. Fully open mask mandate. Goes show essential masks getting spread down. Nope don’t. Rather enough don’t virus able spread like remember someone tweeting something like bunch toddlers getting murdered didn’t bring single reform gun laws US (to say nothing mainstreaming right wing conspiracy theorists doxxing harassing parents lost kids...), US past point return absolutely nothing would ever change matter self destructive path got. Feels relevant today; sure really death toll ever overcome Americans’ toxic selfishness. Americans care, I’m vet scared family. dumbass “freedom” preaching people aren’t Americans . would rather see fellow man die help out. 
Pathetic. Someone nuke us. think Trump control Oxford Group? Pfizer? quote “It is” Donal J Tump currently known PUTO, mean POTUS stoppable. make sacrifices stop exactly. always people like US always lot them. someone like charge emboldens social media spreads message.  Understanding circumstances outside control may lead untimely death one thing. Actively shunning simple recommendations researchers doctors save life lives others another. People pretty stupid. That's ignorant. tested much population yet antibodies previous infections.  suppose lot more- countries testing results public cough cough China present, cough India. reasons? antivax nonsense Maybe theaters unnecessary then. Time say goodbye. see *a lot* people Facebook feed traveling place. understand makes livid. I'm immunocompromised two small children want die potentially lifelong health problems *on top of* health problems already have. want anyone else. 

I wish could put deniers island somewhere let thing rest us get control. found freedom breathe agency today. We’ve really hit whole another level stupidity past 6 months. number cases community low zero, risk gathering resulting new cases low

It's imaginary thinking could ever case. soon European examples think highly re-open, virus spread there. 

Repeatedly re-opening/closing crush left economies countries. 

There end game approach. never realistic begin with. You’re right! Germany alone 16 states 16 independent Ministries Health decide corona regulations state plus course federal government provides leadership funding. Overall 7 different parties involved state governments. 

The mess seeing US matter complexity, it’s matter (wrong) principle. communism good things happen bad things happen, real communism generalize ""prolonged indoor contact outside one's bubble"" realize line physicians, high risk people, first responders, etc? OPTION get vaccine immediately release. first 10m doses specific folks. 

You'll wait 90 days regardless feelings. “...the failure powerful nation world...” 

Clearly anymore. 5 years ago, would legit surprised. Trump may drained swamp... gotta give credit showing half fucking country swamp. He’s great 4 year cash grab. meant combat retired nation guard.

But FAQ

Could sent combat?

Yes. National Guard's dual state-federal mission, Guard members mobilized protect defend America battle domestically overseas. happen, trained, ready prepared go, mentally gas station cashier touched recently  am. People need get grip stop panicking COVID. recovery rate MUCH higher fatality rate.

And honestly? Western Europe POSITION point lecture. country exist plan B Americans want Americans anymore. Stay home clean mess created. owe rest world They'll take whatever snake oil they're shilling say ""see snake oil work, scam!"". Special mention MMS essentially bleach. figure that? possibly going know every single person set foot bar grocery store? happens try meet halfway people constantly running backwards Maybe try shutting turning back again? Hey fuck face bud Therefore solution issue would wear full head cover. Unlike mask protect everything many flaws; example - still perhaps lets contaminated air edge gaps. Eyes exposed.

Ie could get garbage bag form shape head, get clear material like sandwich bags cut hole see garbage bag seal sandwich bag sheet hole created. Get HEPA filter fabric cut another hole perhaps front face garbage bag head cover - cover hole HEPA fabric, ensuring airtight fit contaminated air gets through.

How connect stuff together? Perhaps waterproof adhesive bind stuff together - perhaps plastic plastic areas vacuum seal plastic together.

Now something way effective mask / face shield. Virus may still get simply going around mask/face shield edge gaps poor filter like cloth mask. Airborne virus floats air, air fluid dynamics renders something like mask / shield ineffective. Something like head cover hand make sure seal air tight let contaminated air, solves issues.

Now go step make entire garbage bag suit seal head cover created - seal together like space suit - perhaps use temporary tape seal head cover suit.

Though make need supplies so, also food - may need go somewhere risky, perhaps try seal mask face tape wear swimming goggles perhaps compensate till something better. Fuck republicans. think people locked killing babies... Yes. “freedoms.” I'm American, feel secure.

Essentially half voters voted one way half other. close electoral college resulted different results depending look it.

That much means Trump voters minority except tedious definition ""not majority"". wife wanted go Europe last year asked wait year 2 save, fear banned Europe years Can’t sane people leave insane ones there? They’d probably kill go back reclaim country. used lot replies Twitter ""updates"" - Especially everytime calls ""the China Virus"" instead Covid19 self isolated home since March 12th, leaving home take children pediatrician vaccines. Everything delivered house. 

I part! us care time stump lumping Americans together. south. Republicans. is. . . people think educated makes elitist. people revel ""simple"" thin veil selfish. live Northeast. care. Masks required. People try socially distance. still work we've gotten one 1200 dollar check, still cases least trying. I'm sick hearing ""Americans this"" ""Americans that."" SOUTH. REPUBLICANS. us. protesting rioting isn’t exactly helping. can’t help think big corporations actually MADE money Covid relief funding - including tRump family real estate interests. American I’d spitting fire... sure helps, world really feels sorry you. guys. :( guess 3 months so. Then, long lines. Could six months get everyone wants it. 

And need two doses, 28 days apart call 5 million statistic. ""Are going try convince black people's fault?! Good luck.""

\-Dad  mostly NYC realistically second say grocery store bar tracing pretty much screwed. Good luck even remotely identifying everybody one places 

Sure, home work parents house fairly easy trace. start looking public places number random people go pretty much dead water. place blame bartender would wonder touched every single surface also placed hands random people shoulder shoulder trying walk bar table. misunderstanding guy's point mile. They're saying relatively low central authority EU well, individual European nations responded pretty much individually. unlike US, pandemic become politicized 40% population fighting pandemic response, European populations pretty much understood/understand situation behaved differently individual levels. managed suppress virus, haven't, social reasons, US ""isn't built deal pandemic"". think live constant existential crisis question every decision ever make entire lives point one wants leave homes. would solve problem. mask would decrease sales lipstick secretary education's pyramid scheme sells!

(In case know *why* DeVos family funded astroturf anti-mask group convince people wear masks. talking about? Mythical? Diseases R0 measured. Since referencing ""bad faith""? care! However, caring many Americans stops immediate family. little communal connection American, political views grow divided people come see people opposing views points enemies. house divided. 

Now here's opinion address this. national mandate health safety practices appropriate consequences followed. Consequences fine piss people off, mandatory education, similar States bad drivers return driving school (but online). national effort unify us support one another, beyond usually get, idealistic campaign speeches.

Furthermore, massive restructuring US education system major funding increase education standards. 
(As well large financial incentives become educator, similar military uses increase recruitment.) 

I would also suggest outlawing lobbying groups use financial incentives sway politicians, punishment politicians take money. (Special division IRS FBI monitor this.) Lobbying could still done, public debate setting qualified fact checkers review board present. 

I would also like see term limit Congress committees needing minimum 50% members specialist subject (rather often uninformed Congress members.)

Sadly, none likely happen long rules made plenty personally gain them. ""~~Soylent Green~~ Children people!"" highly abnormal. world, including United States, gone back normal life back normal months now.

Well thats true all. live BC Canada we've done amazing job keeping numbers things still nowhere near ""normal"" here. Statistically, according CDC stats, COVID-19 already 3rd leading cause death USA yearly basis, projected 340k deaths coming third, heart disease 647k cancer 599k. 

These stats don’t consider lockdown measures specifically lower COVID deaths without affecting cancer heart disease.

5.15 million people tested COVID-19 USA, 165k died. 3.2% mortality rate. Assuming COVID deaths accurate (which they’re not, they’re undercounted) double amount people caught COVID tested, leaves 1.6% mortality rate. 16x deadly deadliest iteration flu, even accounting extrapolation CDC get flu deaths.

This without mentioning significant statistical evidence COVID leaves infected people possibility countless long term issues, like heart lung failure, propensity develop MONO pneumonia, weakened immune system.

Which part statistically bad I’m making be? stimulus check $400 dollars unemployment fix everything. College sports merely athletics, (for football basketball) revenue streams. 

#followthemoney Yeah. True. got lucky Zika. Brazil Germany. Kind makes sense now.... it. I’m sure you’re arguing, honestly. I’m acknowledging serious complications myocarditis I’m acknowledging people may develop permanent damage. making the, correct, clarification myocarditis synonymous scarring synonymous swelling...in *exact* way myocarditis synonymous death, even though sometimes outcome (like scarring *sometimes* outcome). think cardiologist disagree assertion, sure, send way. sad needless. Slightly OT: saw contagion first time last night shocked..

Remember teachers used give questions would test, slightly different wording parameters, test?

That film. phony cures social distancing masks...

And fucking failed didnt fit well love freedom.

No, that's wrong, failed small percentage population willing kill people tourism entertainment industry thrives PROBLEM. Surfaces common source transmission, yet stuck them. anyone told Mrs. DeVos? probably wants update score card. I’d rather infected. system broken, corrupt, needs changed can’t tell things fixed? even “problems“ are? rebel without cause. EO helps 

It really doesn't. entire memoranda EO bait switch media operation designed make look good. one, UI extension talking authorizes states set new vehicle pandemic unemployment assistance would take months bring online. Additionally, federal funding makes $300 (and enough 1.5 months), broke states kick another $100 somehow.

The payroll tax holiday another bait switch. commanding IRS collect reducing amount owed. deferral period must collected lump sum. top that, holiday apply people making 100k.

The technical complexity changing HRIS system hold SSOADI payments people making less 100k vs. people make 4 month tax holiday exceptionally high. Many companies inhouse HRIS development team need pay $200/hr consultants figure out. hold SSOADI taxes escrow 4 months. gut tells nobody comply places keep paying. first told needed quarantine waiting results, that’s changed it’s plain stupid. I’ve directly exposed work 3 times. H coworkers ridiculously sick got positive results , things thrown face, people screaming me, guy try pull mask face, people coughing money handing me, complaints corporate enforced mask rules. 
Our owner told us stop enforcing people get angry messed scores visits. basically said suck don’t react people get face throw things... yeah finally quit nervous breakdown. Idk wtf I’m going feel like deserve work sort environment shitty pay(even assistant manager made bs money). Well fair 7 day average new cases also significantly, positivity rate still mid-teens suspect something pitiful amount tests conducted lucky expelled her.... California, 3.6% people diagnosed COVID-19 March May died disease. Among diagnosed June 1 Aug. 3, figure dropped 1.2%, according Times analysis state data. 

The fatality rate probably keep falling. long run, surprising proved 0.5%.

But highly contagious.  one-quarter US population gets infected (an infection rate similar Spanish influenza pandemic), end 400,000 dead US alone. exactly great. Even 50 percent effective vaccine would pretty much allow us return normal. Ugh, dumb take. one, even kids get sick die this. another, notion kids shorter can't spread adults nonsense. Yeah NAFTA Mexico Canada really negatively affected agriculture industry Mexico sudden super-subsidized US corn wheat market. coincidence obesity took either. Americans already go Canada say they're ""going Alaska"", Canadian citizenship. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* nurses take step back leg checked cause isn’t worldwide pandemic going draining resources spreading health workers thin. pandemic?

Okay. wrong. tax regular sales tax? waiting month tell phase 3 trial won't? Oh part media does, Trump likes vaguely refer ""Radical Left Media"" instead actually saying names networks.

Thanks Buddy making lot assumptions me. answers, that's elect representatives knowledge access information form effective legislation.

Besides, sounds like answers already. gonna lie, nodding head agreement thinking US, see formula result even across oceans entirely different culture. US really actively involved around 1943, quite 4 years still. Well fine till trump messed mail service knows ballot make time seems like incredibly illegal grow lbs bud. guess grow process oil something lower weight illegal new vaccine medicine long term side effects won’t known tests able run long term. Let’s say causes issues 2 years people. won’t know data least 2 years out. opened early ""economy suffering"". we're seeing long term economic impacts long lockdown. example one, multi billion dollar, industry wont run.

Much ""Me Generation"" ended selfish everyone else's good! waited Chinese queue? would’ve done ANYWAY!!!! That’s nurses do! heinous thing do, works 

Did sound like endorsement?

I simply saying wanted country reduced ethnic strife - draconian, immoral, effective solution remove one culture/language. 

England effectively many colonies. 'former English colonies speak English - nominally aligned ''shared values''. Japan effectively Okinawa Hokkaido. 

Was moral thing do? course not. worked. works too... Thought took two weeks?  I'll eat hat get eventually, report still says 9 last week. 23 cases number since July 1. equate racism senselessness. far know it’s illegal impersonate police officer… Therefore wouldn’t illegal impersonate federal agent? Separation desks... smaller class sizes...

They'd build classrooms order implement recommended separation. context would completely ridiculous claim, could see reading literally. stopped reading Italian guy talking shit U.S. hc system. Yeah ok buddy. I'd sooner listen Trump tell humility. care him. Hence added ""s"". damn, universitys risk cause cant make millions black athletes backs free smh. Tough times. Im trying rude, waiting line anything “common sense” intelligence China’s people OP said? I’m lost that. you’re suggesting takes longer something reason obvious comparing population (btw, waited line DMV South Florida 8 hours last January).

Also, definitely agree average Chinese person probably perceptions Uighur population (I used tutor Chinese children would speak candidly bad Muslims Xinjiang were). part blamed government propaganda. Since we’re comparing US China, though, Chinese racism Uighurs different American racism? I’m talking government policy here, common beliefs society general. Americans racist whole. Spanish flu existed 2020 ease travel, number probably goes Ouchie! investment huge.

This investment. grant/donation. philanthropist, charge charitable program.

The Gates Foundation charitable program. ""It's like one guy"" Exactly, projected deaths.

Hello mcfly! Running school hard. Reworking entire school system accomodate parents, governors, teachers damn near impossible.

Make mistake, horrible course action, administrators never going able come total plan. said would result millions deaths. People laughed said dramatic.

I’ve sadly proven right. epidemic biggest nightmare human affairs probably since Black Death. It’s already worse WWII statistics attest.

Then take account fallout yet come (including possibly civil war US) makes frightening.

This something could prevented current administration taken seriously.  mean. really surprising, Harley created entire brand around baby boomers rebellious, that's it, riders follow image, mostly dont wear helmets, do, wear half helmets really protect 37% accident(based riders hit accidents), mostly dont wear full gear.


Plus, bikes objectively bad compared Honda, Kawasaki, Ducati, Yamaha, etc. 

They way expensive get, bikes arent really fast aerodynamic compared bikes, super heavy are, makes slower. German outlets too.

No. 10, Washington... take reply however want. However, take childish proves desire entertain nonsense right take. 

Go troll bother someone else. BLOCKED finding loopholes around pandemic bunch shitty humans want remind everyone people Sturgis overwhelmingly rally, ignored. mostly state business owners lobbied go ahead anyway. forced hold event, suffer consequences, will. Congratulations New Zealand! I’m happy all. wish US like place. Yeah title tell whole story. lot smart people rightfully skeptical, especially vaccine like going pushed soon, likes never seen before. know long term repercussions. Imagine dumb enough live place saving 50% salary even max retirement accounts LOL

Higher rent fine long save more. Yeah family date vaccinations. getting Covid vaccine? Absolutely! ..once watch everyone else take rushed version make sure there’s harmful side effects. Well, like Brazil horrible track record dealing epidemics either. One could easily argue fucked even worse US. US system already unable deal opioid crisis. Brazil contained zika quite well comparison. know two different things still. Schools aren’t things. school supervisor Georgia even said CDC guidelines crap wasn’t bothering them. 

The camp least *tried*. heard stages grief necessarily follow specific order, stages necessarily happen once. Today This. way optimize slow spread much possible. half measures made economy worse could been. 

I don’t agree voters disenfranchised this. going say thing. Also, would imagine average age would much lower case WWII, perhaps makes loss tragic worked pain continue helping patients. Yeah clearly didn’t read cause wouldn’t talk did. Tots pears concur it’s going need active tracking tamper resistance collars Sacré bleu seriously expect American tourists self-isolate 14 days? That's vacation time year right there. watching America news much??? he's Demo God Coastal wetlands might help residents/communities live near estuaries upper river happens tributary ocean, coastal wetlands don’t jack shit communities built beaches barrier islands. Allow lol. bunch dumbasse's don’t see helpful comparison all. many people die heart disease, auto accidents, etc don’t put world war level effort. 

To clear, obviously terrible job managing disease many lost lives needless, don’t see comparison really opening eyes. graduated 91. rule too. Spuds Mckenzie! Girls sent home showing much skin also, think people knew it. ever disclosed us, girls sent home. One girl knew curvy hated rule. really care school though, wear whatever wanted ended suspended. never see that. feels like years-ago memory. Wow care?

Me noooooo. people realize astounding. people think everyone run drug store, day approved?!  sub would benefit removing least delaying visibility cattle voting. OP posted relevant topic responding replies. better peeps stupid thing write end Organic foods pesticides used also, different types. Organic mean pesticides.

Also, think ""pretty obvious"" all. EPA released statement earlier year saying Glyphosate substantial risks human health used directed. I'm saying that's true, obvious continue study it. Well taken, thank :) Ah yes loud stupid minority. 

Mix younger people want keep status quo going bars seeing friends largely unaffected pass others shit keeps spreading Pretty happy telling partner morning driving populated street. outdoor restaurants packed. Like, yah, guess you’re outside you’re 6 inches person next you, wearing masks. Friends posting vacation pictures. We’re moving bc expect go long time don’t want waste money city rent. head knows it’s right, it’s disconnected I’m seeing. can’t shake feeling I’m paranoid retreating gone plain nuts. USA #1 Lets go free. important, bigger question wearing masks increase spread? answer no, wear already. zero evidence generation exception. coincidence peaked time they, generation, peaked. downhill ever since, especially starting Boomers getting power. Yes agree. I’m predicting study used country justification reopening schools country founded rich people avoiding taxes tbqh. spirit never died. don’t understand point racial divide. saying virus racist? it’s Maybe Phase 3 trials, collectively hundreds thousands people. one 30k. side effects seen far mild - headaches, injection site pain, mild fever. things mean immune system working. care bunch people side world think us because...? stoppable! New Zealand stopped it. Mongolia stopped it. Hong Kong stopped it.

Rawanda stopping it.

Americans want things necessary stop it! even small, southwestern Virginia county we've went 100 cases since reopening....the total cases lockdown? 2. 

We've 2 deaths last 10 days. 

Know people saying? ""Its fake"". Every day hear stories people knowingly confirmed positive tests going lightly symptomatic infecting others think sniffles flu. president even said this, multiple times. 

How change persons mind? knowingly deadly pandemic went like nothing changed cases hid symptoms. Idk anything situation Quebec, cant say much it. Canada whole hit far less harshly Sweden guess Quebec epicentre there.

Atleast Canada seems actually stopped outbreak spreading beyond Quebec, Sweden Stockholm worst hit region allowed spread throughout country.

And hey dont want people upset country, dont goverment lets thousands people die. Sweden democracy no? gonna lot worse that... Colleges schools opening lot person wearing masks anything try get virus... mean look Georgia. gonna lot worse rest year. I'm afraid leave house starts. almost like COVID survived think kill you. didn't. USA one religious countries one uneducated. think God protect weaken “sinners” live mormonville btw r/coronavirus started, along Lockdownforever symptoms don’t know would reason. probably should’ve said 50% asymptomatic rather undiagnosed. ""We Italians always saw America model,""

People countries looked US decades. But, truth have. US messed long time, cultural exports (movies, TV, music) made seem like US shit together.

Only people finally realizing truth, US exceptional never been.

Let's hope Americans realize too, COVID death toll hits half million. money. Ireland can't afford lose political capitol Washington. US key ally country run by... well, know. guess hundreds thousands people got remvoed voter rolls ""reasons"" care. Right? Country run bunch even know anymore. watched Trump's axios interview explains everything, man living world, far removed reality. GL USA. I'm gonna need see source that. I've seen, terms rushing process, talk allowing ""challenge"" trials, speed process. Challenge trials affect quality data, they'd really unethical. one advocating releasing vaccine without sufficient data. Reddit isn’t rational evidence immunity impossibility still spread probably isn’t confirmed yet. comes across like well read, erudite even. *If* Americans care, care enough actually anything. expect/hope enough others right thing make go away. 

From observations three main groups (and little subdivisions go into):

1) Actively following regulations recommendations slow spread protect can

2) Care, enough act (the group mentioned top) beyond least effort asked

3) care all, take action/actively offended others caring That's assuming 60% estimate accurate. people effectively immune virus whatever currently unknown reason (see large asymptomatic population) percentage may much lower. actually, perfect reason use guide. went highest deaths per million world (your words, know true) condition now. sure, initial response lacking, mistakes made, end eventually worked. I'm Peruvian, confirm. political situation shitshow helps all; new Health Minister said today new quarantine happen cases keep rising. people support MMS bullshit """"""cures"""""" yeah, there's lot issues here.

China hungry natural resources, I'm afraid ""help"" gonna cost us pay. must depend live. know people support Trump, ones know like stock portfolios well. vast majority people know real life think Trump complete idiot fully believe science. Well people WI worst good luck would known; create dumbed population ignores science common sense social media cancer fake news end bringing entire country down. paradox support.

If stop issue come ask bother paying you, there's never issues.

If stop issue come ask bother paying you, stop happening. hard-core dgaf lives citizens. matter comparison stock values?

Edit: hard /s world isn’t limited US. relevant UK policy makers, still relevant rest EU many, most, countries. Biological products software Yup, exact situation outcome... I'm starting hate people. I've become really vitriolic pandemic. Quit. Spreading. Lies!!!! 

You parroting bullshit you’ve come across idiots fucking clue. STOP IT! takes long get test results! trapped  

Speaks volumes me. month long vacation planned Germany summer. gonna go fact hunting real plausibility moving was. (Mostly seeing job opportunities would be.) Cos fucking done US bullshit here. now, literally can't go bullshit. feel like caged animal. takes long get test results! Took two weeks! wish dead.

And yes. CDC numbers real. Even anti trump biased mind stops admitting yourself. 


PS. Italy nations quit mass testing. anymore. Portugal too. Government said it. test people severe symptoms. Why? want alarmism want save touristic season. 


So.. YEAH. Instead posting random 2 words comments show ignorance denial, least try make point. Get together get vocal. lots way get message there, mean attacks Reddit subs.

Never thought that. Good point one point, probably given slew documents regarding testing, virus, possible outcomes, etc., promptly threw trash name mentioned 20 times first paragraph. So, grab live power liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiìi Southern speak,

""Damn ain't so."" reminder bot buck got stuck somewhere else Europeans allow explain what's happening U.S.   

For purposes explanation would considered 'liberal'. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

A majority white people 'christian', deeply bigoted, also known 'christian right', 'republicans'. account 40% U.S. population.

The 'christian right' considers non-whites, non-christians, non-striaght, pro-abortion people enemies country, consider citizens.  'christian right' considers people siphoning money country, making weak, due welfare, food stamps program designed help poor.  'christian right' believes poor people poor choice. 

The 'christian right' considers white, straight, christian, pro-abortion people race traitors, country traitors, better known 'liberals'.  christian right **HATES, HATES, HATES** liberals, hate groups believe liberals brainwashed side god, 'christian right' groups could suppressed driven country. 

The 'christian right' hates liberals much would willing shoot thought would hurt liberal, joke exaggeration, see COVID-19 think I'm joking.   

**'Christian Right'** 

They believe U.S. christian nation, believe earth 10,000 years old, believe god planted fossils test faith, believe Jesus white, U.S. god's chosen country, white christian, U.S. citizens true believers.  

They believe science, mostly scientists tend liberals.  believe government run liberals government trying actively stamp Christianity, white people.  also believe media run liberals. also believe government taking money 'christian right' giving undesirables way destabilize country. 

They convinced beliefs **hatred**, quite easy manipulate block.  

These people believe god protect them, reward afterlife. also believe law god abide laws men. mind means justifies ends.  

They also believe Constitution gives freedom please, know freedom.    

Most 'christian right' see Russia enemy country populated mostly white people, large Russians hate group undesirables 'christian right', enemy enemy friend. 

**COVID-19**

The leader cult, Donald Trump told virus 'fake news', told wearing mask work, people saying differently liberals, course definition means liars trying destroy country.  Lock-downs liberals way ending free speech, freedom religion. Wearing masks another way control masses make conform.  

The 'christian right' believe published cases, death tolls, thinks liberal plot push welfare 'undesirables', effect stealing money 'christian right'. 

**HISTORY**

This U.S. happening country prior WWI, war happened internal agenda got put hold, great depression, WWII, cold war, cold war ended U.S. common enemy, 'christian right' went right back deeply bigoted roots, trying harm undesirables. Plus, came back yelled 'I killed Hitler!', everyone would like 'who?' 😳 answer is! - some. overlooked comment entire thread. hearty guffaw. hope assholes get severe cases COVID recover new outlook.

You're much generous Same...😢 Right? people defending Nazis day told go back inside home saying right wear it.....they braindead morons would let holocaust happen say ""we can't anything right hurr"". people say society. harsh statistics ethnic people, they're bit unhealthier average, hitting democratic cities first due tourism/business/urban population/nightlife, republican talking points 'it cant hit us spread out' Basically yeah.

The first doses vaccine would earmarked risk severe cases covid.

Worth remembering severity deaths evenly spread. Certain cohorts demographics make lion share. targetted vaccination effort could drastically cut hospitalizations deaths.

Effectively giving us situation covid eradicated deaths, hospitals overwhelmed it, making comparable flu. 

Add that, things like encouraging working home, hand washing proper sick pay would help mitigate it, allowing normality resume  short: not. weed purchase online, according lab tests seller actually pretty high CBD knows accurate results actually are.



Yea, smoking definately help. Got dared gravity bong friend proceeded cough point throwing up. 1/10 That’s don’t understand people. debate seriousness virus reacting think whole world secret meeting killed people ruined economies potentially decades get rid trump? Americans care. government not. Also minds Europeans, ""If Americans can't take care themselves, reliable ally they?"" 4 types Americans far pandemic goes. 1) scientists telling everyone stay home much possible wear masks/ social distance must go necessities. 2) Americans believe listen science. 3) politicians worry money believe cant scientists say bc hurts economy- regardless many deaths costs. use lot false information justify stance. 4) Americans believe politicians know best. too, freaking live here!!!! Right now, 3.19% Oh no, whatever happens, ‘it’s God’s plan’. Yeah 45 million people don’t jobs. They’re trying figure survive rich people existing. can't fair safe working living conditions all. mean. lot countries really well without masks. 

Look something like Finland.

And I'm saying masks bad, clearly best solution agree this, let's act like Tfump popular vote that's way game needed played. campaigned right places beat system. needed popular vote would spent time Cali. Dont put words mouth. whole conversation based 3.5% high death rate around 1%. no.. Im worried 99% survival rate. age 65 underlying conditions sure i'd weigh risk accordingly. However... wear mask case im asymptomatic catch im essential worker, eat healthy, exercise, take vitamin supplements. Im worried getting covid. i'll quarantine 14 days thats that. paranoia catching silly based data hand. 

Most countries went partial quarantine wanted make sure hospitals werent overhwelmed. 0 cases. always going positive case growth. local hospital underwhelmed laid 60% workforce. youre personally covid hotspot worried odds. Act accordingly. However again, ever corrected math 3.5% fatality rate original comment youre young average health... fine. Killing fetus ""bad"", killing innocent civilians war animals ""okay"" mind, stfu. Gods don’t kill people. 
People gods kill people civilization collapsed every time Ebola outbreak. even read comment? Higher mortality means severe extension visible symptoms. leads easily identifiable cases means spread identified contained.  LiTeRaLlY sAyS cOrOnAvIrUs There's plenty evidence Italy did. US lockdown Italy. pretty much ingrained us ignore personal needs duration shift. peed 6 hours? slept 24? bad, keep working. Sometimes makes sense me, we're willing put needs hold. still hurts see. ain’t Captain Trips Wait, guys pay 10% income health insurance? Plus copays top???
That’s pay healthcare Canada, peace mind know I’m covered almost anything icing cake long term effects potential risk, timeline trials pretty much important piece  every common cold coronavirus though. types viruses cause cold symptoms. That's disease referred colloquialism (the common cold), rather virus name (influenza, measles, HIV). Similarly, ""stomach bug"" ""24 hour bug"" could whole host different viruses (norovirus, rotavirus) well bacteria parasites.

It's ""common cold"" symptoms a, well, *common* defense mechanism body experiencing infection nasal mucous membrane, 5 symptoms Pepto Bismol jingle common defenses infection GI tract. Currently upper Midwest, right middle 80th Sturgis Rally. Mask wearing non-existent. People packing concerts bars. Social distancing joke. Already multiple instances people meltdowns asked mask up. Then, event ends, huge Central States Fair setting Rapid City. huge gatherings. huge events concerts. stupidity. doomed. That's smart take said.

You need control stop spread. vaccine, get significantly easier. people get heads asses start actually considering health neighbors, done relatively soon vaccine comes out. America care.

It's south. south care.

That awful cesspool humanity blight country since Reconstruction.

And REALLY need step listen science, we're acting shocked won't?

Why keep acting surprised Sun Belt disappoints us? politicians speak like parents want discipline kids want like best friend.

Get authority, leader, people what's right.  Well need select politicians voted whatever party fit in. 42% Americans brain, guess. college partially going online teachers still teach person I'm scared them. Fauci offers 3 weeks election? Every country crazies. Thing is, let drive bus (fly plane run government). US military made us get multiple rounds anthrax vaccine. don’t know single news story past decade involved anthrax deaths.


I’ll gladly take vaccine. people conditions don’t allow take it. minute risk fair trade help protect fellow man. 

300,00 dead Americans December. Try bit compassionate emphatic. Try sacrificing micron normally do. God damn hate fucking moderators. Well, inevitable people eventually going exposed virus. way slowly letting sections population become exposed. stagger it, hospitals cope.

Great plan. 

Who shall start with? Older people dependents. makes sense. literally says coronavirus title it’s head? Uh okay. America close 419k number end Trump’s first term. might get double re-elected, easily see 500k+ even Biden win. 

Counting excess deaths. dead people don’t care officially death certificates. American’s talking point comes to: gun violence, healthcare bankruptcy, covid, hurricane, etc. miss anything else? live San Antonio everyone wearing masks social distancing.

US shit-ton wars since American revolution. add starting 1775, exclude five huge wars (Vietnam, Korea, WWI II, Civil), we’ve lost people American wars combined since 1775. 80 wars. think misspelled „desperate laughter“. problem symptoms. minor symptoms. easy say would isolate, slight headache runny nose it, something really important do, hard actually stay in. also comes potential ridicule, repercussions, reality lot harder people realize. 9 19? Fucking trash articles used, fake news written it
















































/s thinks people understand think do. people, included, think vaccine could unknown side effects rushed quickly. 

I'd say people like that, however people think it'll give autism Bill Gates using microchip people. 

Those people never ever take vaccine, (and me) would take it, now. 

Most people follow measuents, wear masks social distancing. thinking critically vaccine see precedent taking years make, one coming within year.

If turns safe effective, that's great. people deserve die. people refuse take vaccine autism thing. Well, agree there. understand reason behind vaccine pushed released end October guess. Trump would advertise tout even clorox solution. Anything get reelected. percentage obviously 100% crazy country much higher non deamon semen doctors behind it. Trump, Kushner Co.... fault too. countries next line world dominance turn make things worse, lot fingers pointed US I’m completely serious. deaths same. It’s different COVID kills child 100 years ahead versus old person would died next year anyway. Agreed. And, unfortunately, since pandemic hasn’t quite effected Midwest, community mindset urban areas isn’t strong. virus still abstract many, local governments started opening up, many assumed safe need shelter place gone. I’ve posting weeks conservative ever responds. I'm inclined agree even though think late. kid responsibility aspect drilled us. idea without people behaving responsibly, freedom all. everyone wanted without care consequences, we'd suffer. 

Turns Mr. Van Duerm entirely right that. absolutely agree you. think easier people see policies set corporate levels. keep climbing sure. fuck bitching about?? 
I don’t want need applause maybe mouth breathers like would stay phone use turn signals wouldn’t need loud bike. 
Eat dick loser yeah saw too. like yours. get upvote Call is, *A COMORBIDITY RALLY* south. You’d surprised healthcare worker part. nurse friend goes way shame people taking masks off. Surprise level: Pikachu. way stops body bags start filling up.

What makes think that?

Didn't hear POTUS Axios?

""It is"" scaring children goes back school September. constantly bringing home colds, tummy bugs god knows els. Children gross creatures, even ""small bubble"" get back. What's going do. eating classroms. kids school 30 children class. really want send back. much little darlings driving insane. 🤣 would rather go insane put risk, risking others. It’s literally tho. 

If need qualify developed world’ fine. 

They provide actual education includes math, science, critical thinking. things education system neglects along heavily subsidized tuition free college education. 

For healthcare, funding comes tax money bankrupting people getting sick. fact, feelings. 

If want put feelings facts it’s feeling country ‘great’. Hopefully keep numbers . Uh, hell? wish virus killed 99.6% people infected??? mad? Civilization would absolutely collapse Roadhouse. private corps accept limited number tests process within 48 hours, decreases daily testing capacity governments take heat reduced capacity.  Health care execs, politicians pay, idiots get information sounds bytes That's absolutely false. getting control many countries now, guess everyone eventually catch US/Brazil/Russia numbers. Lmao It’s trending Japanese twitter, pretty much majority hates it. (Duh) “Frontline Nurse Forced amputate leg ignoring pain care *CORONAVIRUS* patients.” Yep, nothing coronavirus. parents lost house stock market collapsed late 80's grandparents buy new house. However, newly retired little enjoying money saved up. took cousins trips lot never took brother. I'm really sure why. parents also traveled without us lot too. We'd one family vacation year, usually Disney World parents would travel every month friends.

That said, grandparents born countries (Ireland Italy) growing culture Italian-American big focus family, not, guess, long term daily commitments? We'd huge parties birthdays holidays would everyone first fifth cousins attendance, day day basis spend lot time extended relatives even though lived 25 minutes away. /instantkarma Thats telling FDA untrustworthy years. Many countries already didn’t trust FDA. ~~not gonna follow guidelines~~ risking lives needlessly ~~freedom Trump~~ stubborn fucking morons. 

FTFU ""Don't care?"" Apparently enough us do. Certainly enough people power.

If there's one lesson I'm taking, root America's issues many ways disgraceful proportion Americans actually fucking stupid, country plays idiocy whispers sweet lies they're smart ones.

And dumbest part think vast proportion people think problem would agree wholeheartedly, confused becomes obvious I'm one people *they* think stupid sheep. Biggest threat* Like said plenty link quote idiot. need make things up. go TV say ""DON'T WEAR MASKS!"" said million things make stupidity clear. invent? Pretty much Y2k Christianity *is* death cult. agreeing points you’re American get it.

Actually, I'm disagreeing them, European understand American governments work. **Read article**, tell similar country specifically handled pandemic. especially hotspots. somehow implies wack-a-mole approach okay.. say anything spoke might want work reading comprehension. “The inner fuckwit” going go-to description. Thank you! I’ve lived CA, OH, MA... people know actually say things like “we’ll never hear virus election” “I’m scared you, don’t need wear mask” people know born raised San Diego county. Good luck, home state! right spray spittle sing, god damnit! never take freedoms away! /s Time real Revolution planet on? Mortality rate lot less 3.2%. haughtiness gen people astoundingvas spout lies cliches, insulting anybody disagrees deniers science. staunch advocate science, get fucking facts straight. Youre removing political post purely political thread? Or, maybe, Darwinian principle resulting milder virus? comment shows little know flaws American political system, climate politics last two decades. Instead examination vocal segment populists, conjunction perfect storm circumstances led biggest political blunder US history, reason assume majority Americans anti-intellectual simpletons. Americans aren’t trying convince anything, believe not, understand situation better non- Americans (shocking, know).

Edit: yes, downvote real reason current shit show “americanz dum lol” 60-70% herd immunity isn’t even remotely close based observations Sweden, closed environments like cruise ships prisons. It’s probably around 20%. know exactly they're doing. Playing politics. country, other, entire population would rioting streets non-stop goverment comply demands.  


You actually critical mass that, 100m+ Americans stopped working went national strike would produce anything? fear population selfish/brainwashed thinking economy ""Creates"" society total opposite, people make economy. 


I arguing non-stop 2 years Reddit dude said ""Vote!"", ""Call representative!"". That's naive, politicians (Specially corrupt ones) work way. Look BLM movement, moment went ""Peaceful"" mode stopped covered major media, nothing changed policy wise save companies completely missing message.  


And no, ""We big country"" excuse. plenty examples around world people made demands clear every single state.  


I used see USA dream country kid, see mistaken was. honestly hope get rid ""Freedom"" shackles, I'm awaiting November popcorn hand, biggest shitshow modern democracy history. tried disinfectants injected lungs, sprinkled bit UV ?

I seen President United States saying this, live, official White House Press Conference.

He must serious, journalist told spread rumors, President told journalist Fake News...

May History remember face America. ""Farce"" America.

&amp;#x200B;

Make America Farce Again.  Ehhh let's equate uneducated simpletons one history's greatest monsters. Nobody issue wishing death upon Hitler, middle aged former teen mom south deserve dangerous regressive views. Reminds joke God sends boat, helicopter person still like ""where God help me?!?"" dies People need hurry spread more. Glory CCP Republicans care. *who could predicted tragedy???* /s list musical form ""they"" - outbreaks typically follow bell shaped curve. gets better gets worse. hitting cities ripples countryside. Oh! Sorry! Wrong Reality. meant say ""it's Trumps fault"". ""its people wearing masks"". Sweden decreased gdp well, happens global American - saddened state country. really gone pot.  So, EU confirmed 19 mil patients. US half EU population. see EU better honest. shit lol! first step voting current President November. Nothing drastically change America new President comes power January 20, 2021. yeah, we'll suffering disastrous virus pandemic least then. Hopefully along new President, we'll bringing good vaccine. hope. Random Guy establish cause thing place? see people tried, failed, one causes. give best shot see come with. forget long term effects, still unknown. Lets forget deaths counted COVID. Let's forget undiagnosed people. Also, death outcome. lot people ended renal problems, respiratory problems, etc. think important forget that.

1. Let's forget long term effects considered 2-3 weeks. patients display none week 4.
2. Let's forget deaths counted COVID even though cause death accidents.
3. Let's forget early months testing sh\*\*\* real number historically infected least 100x times official one CFR 100 times lower.
4. Let's forget death worst outcome everything else treated. Nah. Need hope DON’T recover A) remove gene pool B) let deaths clarify people near serious acting like it’s dire consequences.

We’re way pass point “maybe they’ll figure out.” We’re war dumb losing. Particularly since beginning pandemic word ""hero"" become synonymous ""expendable"". People think call hero go business without second thought ""heroes"" care get sick. REALLY DON’T CARE, U?  Americans thick headed. won’t listen rules obey them.

Americans allowed in, period.  Yup, even quoted link. 

Month old info failed acknowledge issues raised see ""it's hard people"". requires leadership organization...which have. No, Currently backyard grandma’s place 89th birthday. Everyone masked, staying like 20 feet away, separated drinks nobody allowed inside. didn’t like this. Spoilers: don't. Rich people exist workers compensated well. I’d say point leftist movements make many people ‘rich’ possible. problem wealthy; billionaires up, people never had, lost meaning word ‘enough.’ People who’s greed self-centeredness arguably defining characteristics. *can* exist alongside well compensated cared-for workers, don’t *want* exist alongside concepts inherently means can’t continue **more**. can’t they’ll destroy whoever need *get* more. *have* eat Jeff Bezos ilk want survive. wouldn’t describe ⅓ controlling wealth power. Certainly are, rest plain vocal self-centered idiotic assholes without wealth power.   trump biased

I never mentioned Trump, need get tick looked YEAH. Instead posting random 2 words

It 4 random. least try make point.

Why deleted original post? surprised find Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden outpace USA per capita COVID19-related deaths? Positive cases meaningless without proper context. straw broke reasonable gun control back. Couldn’t even get universal background checks close state based gun show loopholes. don’t wanna take anyone’s legally acquired point guns, slow flood. ridiculous comment.

First 40yo thanks calling kid. still feel like one times.

Now, live exactly?

Because live EU country order get tested STILL wait days wait even get sort results. believe things quicker US cities.

No testing done went back work. overwhelming majority people never got tested state issued new policy ordering random testings stop. sick people immediate contacts will.

Most EU countries acting way.

Now please tell many positive cases mild asymptomatic infected people books? Unlike US, keeps reporting thousands useless positives (because exactly suffering disease), European countries ""under control"".

And use "" "" France, Spain Italy Germany experiencing considerable resurgence new cases.

Also, EU done US hasn't? countries period confinement. Things slowed activity started again. expected, numbers sick patients started rise soon people free walk around.

The country acted differently Sweden. confined anyone stands, sensibly rate infections deaths countries. Sadly true. true sad. Americans act like perfectly acceptable.

No don't. We're pissed it. Europeans hold 100% consistent views things? We're much slaves corporate masters rest you. 
 
Acting like Americans peachy status quo we're along ride... SHM Thousands people walking around street, going bars money alcohol, souvenirs, food, etc.. knowing mask mandate, without mask.


That's what's brazen stupid me. know vote probably matter, also want everyone else think way. think healthier pretend know sure vote one decide election. 

It also help think like this: one vote really matter, amount matter? vehicle could fill people want vote preferred candidate would drive vehicle polls enough people make worth going, many people would be? 

For would two, person. would automatically worth take one person vote.

So me? value vote?

Then also think rare occasions where, odds, ten votes really deciding votes. I'd spend four years wanting bang head wall sort against-all-odds situation came voted. Unlikely, impossible.  wrote dumb article? pay attention Europe countries. recently big clash Belgium police beachgoers. Many people going maskless countries Spain Greece. Australia better. Canada problems. terrible, reputation let trump campaigners lie boldly time ridiculous. federal government limited power comparison Europe US works even better. You’re agreeing points you’re American get it. People underestimate terrible NYC bad. Unfortunately, people already getting lax threat still there. Mother God. jumped Fonz.

EDIT: bizarre mental image I've ever had, I've done serious chemicals life. Nope. lot people simply don’t give shit. 500 children sweden got narcolepsia vaccine. comparable figure would like 16500 children USA got it. (33 Times population) wouldnt call ""small numbers"". choose wrong make. Pandemrix instead Focteria didnt side effect. helping. helping either. Running Hillary help either mess begin with. Lmao.
Which problem itself... 

Someone: 'We successfully prevented problem!'

Everyone else: ""Why waste resources problem?!""

That someone: ""....."" make international pandemic political, listened science experts government financially help us stay home. back running, safety measures place public spaces.

Ontario, Canada. Unpopular opinion: think USA going ""send it"" Covid. I'm pro mask, pro vaccine, mad state leadership, think viral genie bottle us. 

1. Trump psyops damage done terms politicising mask wearing, blaming current problems China, basically incorporating platform. think undone vaccine becomes available. 
2. We're going feel pain. many feeling pain virus loss right now. numbers place typical sources unreliable. Johns Hopkins case fatality rate UK 15%, simply cannot true. live UT, 3%, despite state's numbers almost four times lower. thing change people's minds mask wearing see loved ones suffer die. 
3. We've unfortunately ""voted"" push point. Yeah, many wearing masks, distancing recommended things, many aren't. think there's close schools businesses again, achieving total containment going happen. ""one mine,"" he'd opposing use police force someone commiting property violent crimes.  care. do. nearly fortunate Europe was. got hit lot harder. anything less Europe did. exactly did, cases lesser extent maybe. I'm concerned fact can't get control matter do. Even half nation cares, enough. Everyone needs care. sucks living individualist society. Everyone's themselves. Numbers much higher. odd drop cases since HHS took CDC.  3 posts. Wasn’t sure would get replies. Help us Probably gladly. Maybe 250,000, biggest BLM protest Los Angeles definitely hit Frankly, I'm amazed nutjob GOP members screamed people drug tested get unemployment benefits food help. lie, grandma showed gave hug days ago. told to, wasn’t safe. says “His done”... like love grandma honestly, fuck?? High concentrations carbon monoxide cause cognitive impairment.  deluding reason herd immunity? maybe places started mandate masks public places, regulated public gatherings closed many public places like bars? Maybe real reasons?? sadly pandemic shown us there's quite frankly lot people care stupid. I'm saying everyone America aren't, right media highlighting idiots still screwing everyone else :/ can't 1 oz person outside personal residence.

On residence matter. Yeah love NPR, they've captured plutocrats too. claim journalism unaffected, consequence NPR funded grants, bequests, foundations. groups agenda.

That's important actually donate local stations. country fucking hopeless

Our country going done virus (which survival rate, btw) well Europe. Europe delaying inevitable; everyone going get point. needs burn way population.

When China locked 50 million people, red flag? 
When high school kid established Covid19 dashboard **IN DECEMBER 2019** red flag? 


China set health policies: paranoid Republican looters do. worth it. real experience nothing all. feel like everyone become desensitized first $1200 gone April. We've nothing 4 months. next check needs less 4x last one we're giving away country Corporations. got results 9 fucking days tested. waste. absolute bullshit.

CVS pharmacy. Nice work guys! think so. too. obvious America solve problem. simply *endure* it. 

Most people seem take semi-seriously, takes actively hostile minority really screw things rest us. Even get new government makes sensible plans, never national strategy, nation divided. 

I would plan today's state affairs go years. first test less reliable one results quickly. doesn’t even count reported case unless patient positive test result experiences symptom corona virus. There's nothing anyone say fucking people refuse listen facts science instead take everything gospel literal propaganda machine. USA: ""What say last one again?"" ""Science!"" Cross road gets that, somewhere gotta try something! Yes raise good points, point it’s lesser two evils. government would help us financially people wouldn’t work it’ll solve lot problems. odds happening wearing proper mask (which make) goggles going low. ""Approximately 90% hospitalized patients identified COVID-NET one underlying conditions, common obesity, hypertension, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular really. 

Faucci says he's hoping something 75% effective, anything 50% effective get approval. 

Which means probably still decent chance getting virus even vaccinated. Um, no. last ten years flu deaths 12,000 61,000 US. “I want small government can’t tell do. But, need government take care kids work, better teach anything don’t agree with!” 

Instead of, know, going facts. science... liar sometimes! Omg realized America Mac. I’m playing sides, way always come top. schools going back weather cooling, really need maintain current plateau hit 300,000 end year. Schools returning pretty likely cause least bump current levels 4 weeks - whole new population going get exposed schools. You’re suggesting dangerous thing. here’s something pretty similar saw TikTok:

[Part don’t. 2 weeks turned 6 months. I’m it. Give shot Oxford leave alone. Resting hands front mask.

Okay... setting good example here. 'It is' official response. course would. politicize disease expect type response. amount meaningless deaths American politics caused staggering. argue kill lots Americans need democrats republicans continue existence. handful examples US companies selling Germany technology resources prior outbreak war. Count that's case. think I've pretty good thus far adhering ""six fundamental principles"" lifestyle interested living long term. need get place within year semblance normalcy. world means going bar blow steam shitty week work. need combination more/faster/better testing, affordable effective treatments, hopefully reasonably effective vaccines get us there. references I've come across swab test says that's far likely false negative false positive. Gov. DeWine certainly using rapid test... sure record is. ""I'm sure really cared""

No lady, could care less holiday, they're caring trying right thing. Harley going eventually brand name gets put cheap Chinese goods

They already are. Go walmart bass-pro. school Georgia packed hallways already seeing cases, gonna complete disaster. kids would homeschool heartbeat. school district isn’t even offering online option... sounds like pretty sane place right now.

I assume there.  Yes no.

Beijing city people city Tokyo. However, Greater Tokyo Area people Greater Beijing Area. addition, Tokyo far dense Beijing (Chinese cities actually dense).

At end day, guys arguing arbitrary lines map. could easily claim (Pearl River) greater bay area considered ""metropolitan"" area, would easily exceed 50 million people. could take draw line around japan claim Japanese metropolitan area 120 million people. Classifications like cities ""real,"" abstractions demographics helps humans simplify complex information make Funny enough concert pink floyd cover band early peak pandemic people attended south.  Compliments Here's updated chart new AZ COVID cases last months (with today's data): Cases: 7-day avg continues fall. track for: 200K cases August 20, 5,000 deaths August 25.
Testing: Big drop tests, demand likely falling. 54K tests shy 60K. (22 days left ""Project Catapult"" supposedly pushes 60K Spread: Overall PCR positive test percentage dropped stayed 14.1% (based 1.021M tests, 6.6% low) average week stayed 9% (based 37K tests, previous week revised 11% Hospital Utilization: COVID Hospitalizations dropped 2%. ICU beds COVID patients dropped 10%. (Overall ICU bed usage 83%). Ventilators use COVID dropped 7%. Intubations Respiratory Distress stayed triple digits (55).
Data Source: ADHS


So hospitalizations, deaths, cases state. Testing remains flat around mid 7000 range day think people assumed everyone going get reason. Multiple countries knew shown that’s case, retire appeal futility talking point? work CVS think reason track results easily CVS contracts outside company testing. put test dropbox drive-thru never interact again. outside company picks up. 

I'm 100% sure rules though CVS work become COVID pharmacy yet. 3 tests CVS first one? ""Yeah title tell whole story. lot smart people rightfully skeptical, especially vaccine like going pushed soon, likes never seen before. know long term repercussions.""

That statement bullshit mean claimed. Ffs anti science stop.


Americans believe pick choose science real. must convinced, even basic education grasp entry level topics. There’s many factors same. First all, 1940s 2020 vastly different population sizes around world. Secondly, pandemic, significantly people potential die. 

In order compare war pandemics, you’d adjust total population larger “susceptible” population.

For example, Spanish Flu, appropriate comparison, killed ~700k Americans, much smaller total population today. Adjusted population, that’s 2 million people now. Essential right. bars, refuse go anything grocery store every 2 weeks. social media filled people packed crowded bars. get deserve. can't stop now, part what's better I'd remain extremely healthy. Exercise, eat well, keep healthy foods freezer. may get need ready possible. That's see sadly According wikipedia nealry 500k americans died ww2.
In school (here Luxembourg) also learned 500k americans died.

So now? Obviously much avoid it, hard person work wears mask, 90% people help wear masks. always say would never wear mask bank, BS. bank last place area close lobby, fully open less month. Freaking McDonald's better safety measures workplace Ebola air easier quarentine infected well. it? know happened, read articles this, didn’t read one. good quot. always use that. goes ways. People europe also dont really give fuck USA geography history whole world thing lake want right thing happen extremely passive. leader listened Trump expected. Good luck Brazil. “We working Department Public Health confirm, contact trace, quarantine notify school community.”

I love administrators think writing sentences verbs means they're good things. nickle amount of: ""monitoring, assessing, coordinating, informing, planning, notifying, confirming"". favorite throwing word ACTIVELY front makes less pathetic non-action. China still office like 80,000 something?  (broadly speaking) countries common? laissez-faire attitude toward containing virus... ""I mildly stoked.""  doubled Disney world decided open? It’s probably based growing data super-spreader events coming bars. constant drinking, shouting indoor bars, increasing evidence covid stay airborne hours probably caused Fauci add list.
One constant interviews there’s much still don’t know. flexible evolving advice instead “why didn’t say before??” reaction sometimes pops up. would better test came back positive everyone. would effect shutdown - would good thing.

Or could save money shutdown without farce testing.

I saying shutdown good thing. bad thing. would improvement current situation: planning fail. Yeah mate travel things that’s good. Look I’m avid hiker get car drive it’s risky. eight months pandemic. Please educate long-term side effects!! Give facts, wild speculation “experts” want get news!! People argue flattening curve time here...and proves point! clear either 1) don’t know flattening curve 2) poorly communicated goal hurt us long run. 

And get Fauci saying correct, people going run quotes context headlines, going hurt us long run, people going see vaccine isn’t completely effective (more 98 percent) get vaccinated think it’s rushed ineffective vaccine...when lower effective vaccine NEED people take it.

But nuance going lost USA #1 School Kids testing #1 world.  See: close reading first pages imperial paper plus slim remainder discussion section would also answer it.

Hope helps! Rude generalizations.  see news title future. 2021 Contact Americans no.1 cause death. wish everyone responsible are. article Sturgis rally (or whatever it’s called) made upset people know take things seriously comes pandemic, post pictures parties without masks going vacations Vegas. 

Thank right thing stay healthy! # test code production masks... Tomorrow leaving 5 days vacation island parents decided to, also today country reported highest number cases since pandemic started.

So let's say thought worked Covid-19. gave Pandemrix 300 million Americans back January.


So 20,000 Americans alive possibly sleepy, vs 160,000 dead far? “Since March now, it’s close 167. last time reported, don’t remember exact date, 85 infants, 23 months younger, since date number almost doubled hasn’t long time period,” City-County Health Director Annette Rodriguez told KSAT, ABC affiliate station San Antonio area. Republican Party led Trump much care. Bad news: already 207 k excess death period, compared years before.
And likely whole locking down, home office also reduced causes death.
Like traffic work accidents example 

Maybe suicides overdoses.. don‘t think really takes dent.
So would guess ten thousand deaths addition 207k realistic. think that's almost biggest thing though right?; Knowing expert. keep overhearing conversations like 'How's flimsy mask going protect me?'. experts taking nuanced evidence based approach. spite much talk people they're best demonstrate ""common sense"" oxymoron  caused upswing cases. Quite substansialy sweden example? forgot include estimates herd immunity

I said (before 1% Americans somewhere 2.31 million (1% 70%) 3.3 million (1% total population) dead. problem leadership management density?

Lmao death counts accounts counted. Death certificate farming. Dying Covid included deaths Covid. Etc

You’re grasping straws now. seem actively rooting deaths? knew sounded awkward Yep biker culture Sure, do. Sorry delay. 100k comments day, thousands reports. We’re bit behind sometimes, sorry COVID-19 symptoms bet FDA relax usual safety standards grant emergency use authorization though. Youre wrong, communcation skills political stuff could use polish. know probably not, arguments come weirdly contrarian alt-right sort way doubling probably doesnt help.

They're basically saying ""Yes, impossible. it."" told last week ""when time go God take me"" mask skeptic. wanted ask stopped red lights, ever taken antibiotics life, routinely quenched thirst stagnant puddles. infuriating. American living Tennessee appalled blatant disregard many including governor 'leader' show toward this. watch number surge even small town mask every face handful grocery yesterday, first time couple weeks case then. horrified daughter classroom Wednesday. shameful country allowed powers make political issue. ask send us prayer healing energy. little common sense well.😷🙏💜🤷‍♀️ feel way. We're trying make smart decisions safety everyone, losing idiots believe anything truth. Where's truth refuse? something infecting killing people, individually. ask specific GP information his/her background. sure that's relevant. yea fuck black market, fucking hate shitty dealers claim "" purple urkle moon rocket strain"" proof whatsoever. prices state dropped much ones goes ""dealer"" anymore, 4 years. praise dispensaries area. live desert SW context. Definitely sounds like statement someone thinks everyone New York lives New York City No, trust fund never anything “retirees” lived life like dipshits cause laws 21 drinking nanny bullshit blame youth old people don’t care.

Fuck trust fund wanna nobodies act like they’re important they’re replaceable. 

We’re looking OC. I’m aware option, first time I’ve Walmart years, parents home picking marinade going smoker. Nothing else within 40~ mins. I’d say I’d use curbside pickup next time, happily next time keep seeing comment, density vs density comes virus spread it’s pretty apt. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* would assume FDA approval process co-opted would make Trump look good?

It's old FDA, politicized agency. can't certain trustworthy was.

You get vaccine, I'll wait see works out. safe effective get it. Yearly. yearly flu shot.  admit country dump failed experiment full depraved idiots. Loudly, moistly, right faces!  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* there? also assumes continue undercount number dead. trying #1 something besides obesity. USA: No. need go things. lucky. I've trying reach Republican family, basically told conservative, vote Republican matter leads party. 

They claim look news sources determine truth, actuality world view cherry pick information support it. 

My dad doctor last 40 years truly believes health insurance go emergency room, treatment free. even engage provide evidence contrary, he'll offended think know better 40 years experience medical field. swede: least USA. Yeah state rural. country would expect people take extra-precautions country pay healthcare lose job lose HC insurance. 

Let's forget information stupid selfish people gotten leaders: refusing wear mask, refusing limit in-person gatherings, refusing listen medical expertise, alternative facts covid, etc ad nauseam. leaders shoveled misinformation bad advice pandemic since beginning, gotten worse. posing flexing delivering misinformation badge honor way many people authority.

Small wonder rest world shocked country's refusal follow guidelines that, now, everyone knows way stop spread covid. gone beyond incompetence bungling corruption: US willfully opposite works, deliberately trying spread virus, everyone world sees knows this. fuck's sake, millions US citizens trying infect vulnerable neighbors. civilized society going incredulous. Don’t forget pray. $$$ first...

*This way.* web development actually involve much math science all. terse sets instructions Right... world whole jumped skin nobody fought steps lock immediately Ebola. NPIs also work better killing Ebola nasty killing quickly. death death people reacted Covid like Ebola, would gone lot curtailing it. 

It’s like MERS SARS1 well. liked quicker larger numbers right away spread got limited people died quickly people reacted quickly. 

COVIDs spread onset symptoms lot like flu, people want oversimplify compare directly flu, frame reference world has. happen everywhere virus still widespread. Even social distancing. can’t get children act like children. Damn that's dark...but...if means saving lives, it. Complete utter incompetence stupidity time national emergency. continue behave manner demonstrating fit lead. Yup. Many Americans think either invincible going bailed out, would cross street piss neighbor fire. Deadly 1-2 combo pandemic. No, unfortunately. lacking leader. understand issue used address. whole states aren’t competing like used to. something affects us equal say.

Jimmy Alabama shouldn’t get say do. play poor victim card, set GoFundMe profit. like Europe fared better. top 12 countries highest death rate, 8 European. USA #10. cases slowly rising European countries. NZ Korea, pretty much every country fucked response yeah lot “younger” people dying obese, leads lot health issues virus loves attack majority EU countries higher 14 day average New cases? significant higher?( European Centre Disease Prevention Control) Maybe yet trend clearly pointed one direction, indications slowing Europeans account approximately 133,000,000 + United States Population. 

 Europe past peaks

Based what? Georgia Florida believed past worst two months ago started reopening. European countries position now. I’m still *so* curious referring to. Yeah, well they're laughing us anymore, they! Amiright!? MAGA!

Some Trumper, probably. tends happen people keep giving ghost.  Oh NHS. much love you! STATE 5th highest GDP world. contribute plenty. one perfect. failed? Try again.  recently offered down-the-middle compromise $2T republican leadership rejected it. talking about? bakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabakabaka 79 years we've rolled red carpet assholes, treated way respect they've ever earned, one year ask basic respect community lives, refuse.

Now, fair, rally way compared usual. lot people right thing stayed home. absolute scummiest already scummy community. I'm saying arrogantly dismissed masks back March public wearing could potentially saved many lives. Furthermore, randomized controlled trial mask efficacy occurred yet opinion changed. understand numbers increase r one. someone ELI5? r/NotTheOnion I’m sure greatly missed 99.9% That’s damned crying shame. sentenced serve time potentially legitimately considering parole.. weren’t sentenced die Covid. died imprisoned fucking Covid. problem get lumped people point weird stuff gone particular one. Meanwhile still won’t even get haircut let alone go anywhere besides grocery store community about. obese comes prexisting conditions that.

if you’re obese likely high blood pressure, weakened immune system, diabetes, organ damage. “We managed get students study sometimes useless skills busy work, arrive class time, get abide dress codes every type, put away phones electronics devices, control can’t use toilet... masks? Way far!” This. Lots things risk factors young people may indeed manage. Hopefully get creative like split attendance person classes partying probably gonna happen. rural representation thing utter bullshit. amazes Americans accept normal people over-represented government others disenfranchised \*by design\*. unique system, systemically flawed. forget Infowars valuable medical advice.
/s America going fucking pariah world years come, possibly forever Yeah, close election times. true. I've successfully changed mind 3 science deniers week. 

I say, without doubt, effective method dosing LSD, tying chair eyelids taped open brainwashing see things way.

Very effective. Highly recommend. 10/10. Ope, gonna bad. Yet everyone know still says it’s hoax. Yes Republicans looking better, Democrats worse. longer goes greater solidified distinction come. okay stand principles principles without results worthless. operation success, patient starved death evicted home. they’re willing get it. I’m nurse rush get I’m sure it’s made reputable company I’ve read trials see there’s immediate unintended effects population. 

Then know pretty good sized handful colleagues never get years go they’re conservative. They’re cautious. They’re straight Fox News, conspiracy theory leaning people. thats americans ,

they lie call silent majority way Kim jong un calls country democracy ur idiot u think manipulate numbers order get money govt. place next candidate 20% theory, mean global epicenter one point significant percentage people virus get mild symptoms, large percentage change getting virus. Look Jair Bolsanoro Brazil, really affect much, he's going double view bad cold Ireland places go? Im afraid antifa/ sjws dude scary. one said kids couldn’t get it. said much less susceptible. overwhelmingly accurate Hey friend! 
I won’t go details exact people harbor feelings for, rest assured hit level feelings time back. 
You probably guess specifics fan of, anyway. 
I mince words either whenever I’m conversation friends / family. 
I’ll still bite tongue work around like minded people (still WFH big deal case). 

The best like minded friends - get hopefully meantime weed bad ones. Actually calling social distancing works really well Canada made clear meant, inforces citizens general it.


Edit: also called physical distancing half time. guess Germans marching caring... Maybe mass protests place start... think people like everywhere. problem US people *in charge*. despise fact get lumped ridiculous Trump followers eyes world. 

To rest world: we’re ignorant! promise! may true (i may need research apparently comment real)

However, assertions may upper limits, assertions (that ""forgot include"") flat out, demonstrably, incorrect.

You want debate details? That's fine. wrong plenty, start incorrect information yourself. phone drive letter writing campaign boost postal service? every organized effort person. 

Every Republican holding local federal office inboxes flooded.

Voting great - people even - exactly squawking.

It seem like Americans taking seriously. today learn europeans know nothing united states It’s design internal AC unit. live older house, internal AC isn’t attic. issue couple years ago, too. replaced home warranty paying half bill (we stopped paying home warranty scam shortly after, we’d already paid “fees” paid repairs). $2200 year isn’t anywhere near paying $9000+ replace entire unit it’s like 15 years old now. recognize it’s stop-gap, frankly I’m draining entire savings year. October really build, November people trying ""beat rush"" xmas shopping, idiots Black Friday. There's end sight. [The real Idk Americans keep convincing others anti-intellectuals minority, Trump ""an accident"". accident, would removed tried many times already. mean, assholes Congress self-installed? Nope, voted for. situation formed Trump, doomed happen. paying attention. Typically tuesdays consistently highest week, presumedly it’s they’re able catch everything weekend. I’m sure there’s plenty slip never get counted werent downvoted accuracy, iit percieved non-conformaty [This theme whats going happen unemployment money runs wave evictions hit literally trapped. darker timeline expected knew past 4 years would hard. would died anyway, thousands within months. Covid coincidence. somehow wrong elitism indicator RWA heavy mindset.

You're somehow right americans freaking stupid political terms politics better focus pandemic. distract child guess Buy guns shoot virus away! Can't believe guys STILL comparing cases countries. relevant all! 
It's gonna bite ass using political leverage Trump. death rate always decreases point out. Actually it’s looking like 20% seroprevalence offers sort resistance least virus, well certainly two places (NYC Sweden) seen drop cases know *little* most, try best.

Your immune system best job protecting virus say ""Hey, recognize you!"" lot cases, that's enough completely immunize somebody.

A lot traditional vaccines composed virus particles similar virus question, harmful humans. way, immune system learn recognize actual virus encounters it, deal disease.

mRNA vaccines contain virus particles all. Instead, contain instructions cause *your body* manufacture protein mimics important part virus. immune system learn recognize protein. encounter virus itself, immune system therefore primed pounce annihilate it.

A big advantage mRNA rapidly produced. think Moderna vaccine candidate created within 2 days, solely Chinese data.

Somebody please feel free correct drivel. conveniently omitted fact homeless guy **first** arrested mask violation. also omit fact reason outcry complaints police ignored others breaking law brazen ways. They've far arrested exactly two people new law.

The man also homeless. Feel it, sure; understand it, doubtful. Lol Well they're stupid allowing Americans in. care, know wtf do. anyone really know do? tweeting lives matter shit floyd king first went down. Hes exactly smartest guy oh man read lot stories pregnant women covid losing babies people need get real Unfortunately, still wrong. said death rate (you used word ""stupidity"") *uniquely* American. posted great, verified, evidence esteemed medical group showing America indeed unique death rate. fact, America better large majority countries.


Raw numbers accurate, please go take college level statistics class understand importance removing population inequality data.

But sure, keep anti-America charade, I'm sure makes feel secure that's really matters. got reversed. society accepts, even welcomes for-profit healthcare inherently selfish, selfishness also reject inconveniencing oneself protecting others.

A collective effort combat pandemic universal healthcare, inherently incompatible American values. sub literally become Anti-America sub smh Even common, forms Cancer less dangerous covid, vaccine still win.

I doubt that. mortality rate Covid vs. ""most forms cancer"" whatever means. purely legal complexities fifty independent states unique jurisdictions, extension, CDCs fragmented power.

Like Europe 25ish completely independent countries? argument work He'll probably still vote republican ballot. likely understand republican politicians problem. Trump symptom rot Don’t forget Better Call Saul! people deserving rarely get what’s coming them. also need stop acting like fat death sentence. Yes preexisting condition compare preexisting conditions, pretty far list comorbidity hit 400 million cases, worry 'Rona anymore!

*taps temple grinning* go record, American, yes...a majority us care. smaller number not...and honestly, can't understand either. talking indoctrinating propaganda called 1619 project?

It's teacher pay benefits (including pension) that's majority spending. Probably believe affects African American &amp; Latin Minorities.  Someone tell red necks minority entire rentier class garbage, feudal vestige. percenfage split Asymptomatic/low impact cases/ severe cases requiring hospital treatment globally? think randomised research early days Italy 80 percent cases we're mild asymptomatic.

Assuming 5 million pp tested severe /medium symptoms requiring hospital attention might worst case scenario 20M ppl already this. 

Another months might achieve herd immunity worst hit states. (They actually sacrificed less able achieve this) Surprised Pikachu face? Occasionally? rather fond term already ascribed Trump: Fake Patriot. 4 million July. projections show we’ll surpass American WWII death count 291k months. 

We leaders. People happy willfully ignorant. America, Land Great. bit digging reveals much ""evidence"" vaccine since retracted, impossible reproduce. know, results cannot reproduced worthless. 

Just google Cold Fusion example that... Understand. clear I'm referring categorically deny effectiveness vaccines wholesale falsely state vaccines cause whole host disorders. drug without side effects I'm way, shape, form anti vax absolutely due diligence getting line new drug/vaccine - whether fast tracked fully vested normal channels. thing though us (Wisconsin) going since May WI GOP ruled Gov. “stay home order” unconstitutional. We’ve fully open since people mass gatherings. Memorial Day, Fourth July weekends brought huge crowds IL MN. I’m saying won’t happen feel like already would’ve hit really hard now. honestly come winter gets -20 everyday one outside imo get better. wear masks take precautions though  Congrats! 🍾 I'm shocked, shocked!

Well, shocked. unstoppable 1/3 people live willfully ignorant, selfish assholes. responsible it. fair, doubt anyone could even conceived situation elected him. like campaigning pandemic rally. Laughable assumption. rare occasion see tax increase bad thing. Sadly, voting tax increases often little control distribution money. Unfortunately agree. hoping Democrats would give us younger, smarter, tougher candidate could knock trump (metaphor) show turds real American patriot looks like
 Instead get guy gets lost middle sentence old stand pressure. 
 pity say ""well, care him, got, I'll vote him"". 10,000 people suffered major side ease worry?

Hell no. would want wait different vaccine side effect.
It's like one vaccine.
There probably few. want see safest effective. America, land Karen’s land chads r/conservative. folks either ""FU libs"" ""Trump awesome"" ""Trump bad... but..."". screwed. read scientific article talking about? point anyone mention political affiliation slowing spread, people staying inside due civic events occuring (mostly protests). That's quite different saying ""I'm republican can't catch it"". measuring real impact world events disease spread. little disingenuous say blm protestors impression can't catch covid. find lowkey scary, could mean peaceful protests first turned riots scared others.

So *did* understand article, chose intentionally misinterpret ""blm protestors say political affiliation affects catch it""? particular reason that? well worded appreciate optimism much. Hopefully opens eyes brings care closer together.  one them. cautious vaccine years study behind it. I’m saying won’t get it, want read multiple times take worry pressure speed one came next months. I’m curious mRNA one successful phrase give liberty give death comes mind. americans treasure liberty freedom else. dumb dumb could enjoying life rn others took seriously. 

are better shape broadway actor? seem impression us Americans happy this. Stop acting high mighty like would could anything else position. disease isnt morally upsetting enough vocal minority. 

If tell conservative South 1/65 Americans contracted aids past half year outrage would enormous pitchforks would out. [Or God live? people take seriously around me. I've got friends Alabama family Florida nobody takes seriously around them. free market determine Covid success! I'm currently happy kids

I already knew best thing me, feel like hit lottery. kids NYC need school? fail anyways. COVID crisis, 40 million Americans lost jobs, 3.3 million businesses shut down, we're 5 million infections, 160,000 deaths+, states experiencing ICU capacities small Midwestern towns expecting experience COVID surges, think hardly crippling pandemic? Lucky you. US get proper healthcare post-covid, see it'll ever happen. extended health employer, everything hospital free. employer covers 100% dental 80% rx's.

\-a canada/usa dual citizen, happily living canada.  seems Republicans somewhat ignored happened fellow Republican, Herman Cain, they're still pushing selfish agendas. Thanks Yeah, I’m loss do, besides staying home time wearing mask can’t stay home. washing hands time. way trump pushing everything sun ""a big beautiful cure best ratings"" even I'm tad hesitant. Especially news Russia pushing cure ""100%"" success rate it'd share America. trust anything trump excited about. words great leader, Twitler; “It is.”

That sentiment 40% US population. Quite agree. let’s say right it’s flu - would want get get flu could prevent minor inconvenience. remember feeling like wanted die flu. insurance policy I'm getting Greek citizenship, plus get sweet EU passport. It’s likely around .6%. Nobody thread cares cite sources guess. That's fantasy Unless virus gonna take corporations, US government doesn’t care. Corporations rule American citizens peasants. We’re f*cked. Editors change headlines always start “At least...” know number goes It’s even mask. Ppe last resort

You engineer hazard first option. Stay away parties gatherings They're ready now. Strike iron hot. certainly one way discourage immigration. Weird flex, OK. No, thats false sense security.
You go dangerous situations potentially get infected. think you’re missing point Reddit. delusion higher standards, ignoring political reality Obama faced. 

First, something better attempted before. 1993. Bill Clinton. [ ] crashed burned, made topic fifth rail. 

Second, Republicans added many amendments project, ultimately voted amendments [ ]. means, even something better proposed, chances passing slim. 

And third, fail take account filibuster. arcane rule abused prevent legislation go floor. Oh, requires super majority override. even Democrats majority Senate, legislation could died via filibuster. 

As future USA (and UK), I'm betting anything. many things planned 2020, (if all) panned out. Americans care affects them. could say Republicans well.  Right. get hold situation portion people spreading rapidly others. (Not reasons, still) Show us verified numbers Europe. Europeans always standing high ground thinking better americans. It’s Karen’s mankaren’s Hey Europeans, us got memo! It’s half people country really really stupid. Time start dealing get us cash. Nice try. public vote still 40%. Bit stretch call ""a minority"".

25% would alarming us... keep hoping remove population stupidity Something really can't wrap head around fuck US people hear people dying like flies country, difference EU masks general exercise precaution, yet still try fucking something i.e. copy Europe basic sense responsibility. I'm facetious hyperbolic say can't comprehend keep kind behavior. outside seems like large percentage people forgotten lot basic life rules they've buried bombardment ""information"" ""opinions"" current-age North America.

Edit: I'm Greek today 203 cases reported. That's biggest spike since first days first wave, people seem like they're starting take situation lot seriously again. curfew 23:00 bars etc. already announced. would got upvotes right herd immunity part.. chance anywhere close. Democrats understand game Republicans playing shot foot, need fight stop unemployment extension court nauseating abuse federal power. I'm defending it, I'm saying expect plan start this, Democrats fell hook line sinker. Nancy Pelosi really want fighting stop extra unemployment, are. already stated, Democrats tried compromise, three trillion two, Republicans go one trillion two. That's compromise.

What happened? tough guy! macho oozing him. bet Rona stay away good! really way solve this, right? prefer Socratic method asking questions make people realize flaw arguments, since leads less fights (I guess case). holy shit, never would imagined many people could read poorly, I'll give theres small chance side effect vaccine

1. know? speculation.

2. importantly probably several vaccines coming out. I'd rather rush get one turns dangerous less effective. TBH gonna learn loved ones ICU, die, recover serious complications.

Anything else plays right people believing want believe.

Smooth sailing makes bad sailors. US addicted comfort people act like huge inconvenience.

If know people lived war, sickness, famine parents grandparents taught things see difference behavior.

People job asked mask shield gloves said ""Oh I've ventilator."" liar really believe Trumps testing lies? wonder force public school systems break option go private... aligns Betsey Devos’ vision education U.S. mean stubborn keeps us getting cash assistance majority Americans desperately need time. something like early campaign discredit public health experts, combined poor initial understanding transmission methods, infection rates, comorbidities (because novel virus takes time sufficient data draw firm conclusions) made easy Americans assure COVID-19 serious threat us individually.

It's people's problem someone know personally affected. Even people actively fighting masking distancing orders see issue taking vacation within US. We're stressed sad cooped up, justify traveling around spreading infection ""need"" vacation, expect 200 family friends attend wedding masks would ruin pictures. priorities fucked. 

Many parents want schools reopen work child care options. information consistently received kids high risk, sacrificing teachers school staff apparently accepted risk. also think parents tired kids 24/7, can't say without making joke wine o'clock.  Poetic Yup, care dozens 6 year old children we're gunned schools. 150k, 200k, 500k, 1mm dead still would care. truly selfish country. fools think socialism good idea Deleted. Kansan, I'm fucking dissapointed. Laura Kelly trying hard - limiting social events, making schools go online... no. Republicans. party politics, we're waiting friends family members get sick potentially die. people know wear masks, follow 6 foot rule, limit going whenever can, many people around us refuse even simplest stuff. 'Against Constitution' ass - people fucking care long inconvenienced. problem lot young people don’t care(as well mouth breathing adults.) 75% close friends (I’m 22) caught virus scared miss drinking opportunity. People like friends spread store family, etc. people care , don’t 95% people taking serious, it’s gonna work. squawking, expect us beyond trying get vote like already are? March streets dense crowds spread virus even more? I’m going vote, I’m whatever try get people vote well, I’m appalled Trump fumbled even sabotaged response virus. ""Some bad apples"" last part unlikely happen mindset issue. people fixed mindset result never see ""their team"" problem. seek anything adds confirmation bias echo chambers make ""reasoning"" dismiss anything goes already believe.

Teaching heavily emphasizing Growth Mindsets one best things future generations, individuals, whole. many issues face today come deep rooted ""us vs them"" mentalities everything binary team team issue anything gets twisted fits one side other, neutral middle ground design divide people. Yes 70% upper limit outdated estimates. many needed feed children pay mortgage. Still lower death rate several major European countries American unbelievable position. Trump Republicans responsible debacle. 5 million cases,,,,it aggravates end. “But it’s MuH RiGhT entitled idiot!!! ...And turn entitled idiot mode full blast last dying (gasping) breath!! FrEeDoM!!!”

Sincerely, everyone around me.

Please send help.... really. thx Florida 2 3 years behind them. economy crippled due lack seriousness. one wants come here. get social media relentlessly call trumpism - death cult, beg friends family drink coolaid Recover lol, covid extreme adverse effects lungs afterward. Like scaring decreased lung capacity? half people ideological enemies progress peace ability organize politically crushed. get say anymore. many people care, movements aimed towards fixing it? Civil disobedience, socially distanced protests, coordinated media attacks etc. basically see absolutely nothing happening. BLM protests happened, they're different issue (and also died without achieving anything tangible...).

Honestly I'm kind sick Americans saying ""it's us"", side second part sentence ""but we're bothering anything it""  I'm predicting now. *will* violence November. Either far right far left accept outcome. Also, make sure healthy possible. Stay exercising keep away co-koebiditiies obesity. Diabetes, hypertension, etc. reported masks unconfirmed effective prevent Covid transmission

Depends type said airborne

This according CHina WHO

&amp;#x200B;

So thats fault media. worked Yes flu vaccines basically educated guesses dominant flu strain be. said even 50% effective flu shots much better nothing comparison works fine. It’s bunch smaller independently controlled jurisdictions yet don’t see nearly COVID issues USA. 

The USA anti intellectuality problem. Europe took seriously, USA didn’t. virus isn’t political opinion here, it’s pandemic agree that. It’s simple. argument military mean US easier time coordination response? generally use military enforce lockdowns btw, don’t need neither you. Trump: Thanks bold actions administration, finally achieved universal state United States longer worry people going nations, spending money boost economies- thanks great fanbabs- fabulous fantastic- truly is... truly is... redefined contain virus great American tradition... need longer worry exodus encouraged Democrats- worries... We're used it... Unfortunately.

At early height pandemic beef cartel making $1300 per animal killed person selling usually losing money. American I'm sad infuriated incompetent Trump administration let happen, I'm surprised that's deafening!!! 

I can't fathom anyone supports administration, especially now. reckless 4 years left country divided weak. America become mockery world stage. 

Remember **VOTE REGISTER VOTE** November. time send clear cut message administration time incompetent ruling care, dumbass 'leaders' sure fuck don't. Yeah, wasn’t far drive, maybe 1.5 hours? probably would've sat war, let Axis go wild Europe Asia. Probably could found ways make money too. I’d add comment....the US highly individualistic mindset. It’s gotten even worse last decades. We, country, anything “for common good”, viewed dirty socialism. People whatever want, everyone else damned. look great capitalism working us US. society brink collapse rich people fine. Great. Meanwgile scottish governmwnt paying citizens eat out. dont test dont really know. ask every post? still die it. Blah blah blah students need campuses develop socially...


... Turns campuses schools literal prisons... Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus Yes. point, truly believe people either ""Pro-COVID"" ""Anti-COVID"", refer anyone refuses wear masks, wants open schools, thinks crowds fine, etc. Pro-COVID. know COVID kill people, they're ok that. is. No. Americans selfish, self involved group is. That's point. point COVID numbers US higher mass testing still done.

Europe greater population density US proof behaving better Americans.  


That's seeing Americans losing shit number infections Europeans acting cocky makes sense all. 


We endure it. vaccination arrives take waves develop considerable immunity nothing made stop it. NOTHING. maybe smart enough go? Keep proud dumb though. lack credible alternative national capitalism thing stopping global revolution. used go time, since start I've sworn entirely. unless there's vaccine completely eliminated internationally would revisit. Sucks cuz found nice dealing stress work, I'm less stressed now. sucks one ones trying care...then pics Sturgis Paulding County HS start showing up...  Yup. sing praises single payer day die (soon way things going, I'd guess).

These people willfully ignorant. argue bad faith entire ego buried hatred opposition team. UK hit 20% cases/antibody tests a/the population? live Georgia...

They reopening schools like idiots.
Then area getting surprised school kids infected..

""Masks completely optional.""

Lol

All need rich dude offering 1 million last student standing. Lol could quickly turn game show. Nope. That's common talking point, apply everything. Atleast 1/10 people bars wearing masks, small amount all. Even get made trump makes pay thousands medical bills.
They still vote he's red like them. parent protect kids.from pedophiles? parent thing?


Oh, protect COVID too? Like kids wear a.mask? can’t nice things like this? Link? Using official data, mortality rate is, now, 3.5%.

3% thing anyone catch lot. Even 0.5% lot.



Let's forget long term effects, still unknown. Lets forget deaths counted COVID. Let's forget undiagnosed people. Also, death outcome. lot people ended renal problems, respiratory problems, etc. think important forget that. 

Taking account studies say case count 10x higher, mortality rate, 2-3x higer. get 0.7%-1% mortality. high disease like COVID spreads like crazy.

What misinformation spread? Stop closed minded ""Russian roulette"" METAPHOR. careful, know virus impact life negative way, said, want play game ""LUCK"" (now understand metaphor?). Imagine family, accumulative probability death, using official data, similar Russian roulette. Happy analogy? Impressive childlike behavior Experiment sounds thought professional.

Are really Mt. St. Helens lahars near Portland? Wait, OAN actually promoting hydroxychloroquine cure? That's actually illegal do, reported taken court since there's nothing showing cures Covid-19.

Edit: wow, usernames two different sides spectrum. line begin hump flag? Sweden let people die, stop bullshit propaganda. true, all. There's regional differences Sweden well, regions managed better regions managed worse. 

Newsflash. deadly disease, deadlier older are. People nursing homes usually pretty old sick, disease spread inside homes, people die.

False claims pure propaganda. Disgusting honest. principal want open school forced to??

Regardless said worried mom high blood pressure works autiistic high schoolers I’m double worried. pretty much right Moderna never vaccine approved AFAIK phase 3 shortened several years many vaccines get out.

You're going convince make think otherwise. Anyone takes vaccine clearly pushed Trump administration come election worse Trump voter. 
As Denmark Norway. Exactly situation. claim happened larger extent Sweden. Where’s evidence? 

And where’s evidence Stockholm larger center business Copenhagen? Copenhagen higher GDP larger international airport. Yet Stockholm supposedly much connected world accounts 5 times number deaths per capita? Idk could see funeral homes price gouging pandemic. person replied clearly read article. really going bite Trump ass though. parts country voted Trump places without many (or often any) ICU beds, means death rates could 4-5 times higher. also places person school, expect massive increase infections, followed deaths, Trump's core voters, election. Good thing they're practically immune. XD There’s money now. **They spent all.** don’t trust start right thing now, you? Payroll tax cut help unemployed treated control group challenge trial. whole population serves control. challenged group stays healthy significantly greater rate demographically similar group general population, we’re good go. know challenged group exposed. It’s fact far better evidence effectiveness typical placebo-controlled Phase III. come please? hate here. inject blood mean also vaccine? part puzzling me, every parent knows kids like walking petri dishes. dig deep enough, whole ""experts say children spread covid"" line huge frikkin load manure. experts studies actually found kids 10 spread much lower rate adults (5% - 20% much, pick study); also relying reported observations, absolutely established young kids much less serious cases, often symptoms. possibly lot kids infected nobody ever knew.

And kids 10 50% infectious adults, enough say school classes safe places. lot teachers taking early retirement rather working fall. reality children much less severe cases symptoms, would people take kids, zero symptoms presents runny nose, clinic hospital tested? 97K figure almost guaranteed way, way lower actual percentage infected kids there. Unfortunately both. Even though hospitals nowhere near overwhelmed, contrary slower usual was, routine check-ups delayed several times still haven’t able get in. Dentists, also affected directly Covid patients, also shut down, ones screen mouth throat cancer.

I don’t know much Norway Germany follow DK closely, much lighter shorter shutdown, thy deaths haven’t excess normal. Kids back school way back mid April. Offices back 100 percent months ago. much less socially disruptive response. Much lighter shorter shutdowns. one good job keeping non-Covid deaths low keeping Covid deaths low. people would say ""Chinese movies suck!"" praising crouching Tiger hidden Dragon best cinematic viewing ever, Jackie Chan best stunts, breath. going interesting see plays though. noticed order directs deferment withholding well, agree wise employers withholding unless forced - 

I guess we'll see treasury ultimately implements order. mess. I’m saying limiting exposure shielding saliva, putting US risk, wearing cloth masks don’t filter small particles. realist media right now. used able work empathy deniers, it’s August I’m pretty worn out. Stay safe friend. disagree. think unethical nature challenge trial preys poor subjects likely highly compensated. unethical people go back nuclear reactors prevent meltdown cost lives? No, heroic.

 People take risky dangerous jobs time. said, think covid ways less dangerous said, generally, young adults dont suffer worst outcomes pretty likely youll get without trying. taking non-insignificant risk, societal benefit could roof. Australian bushfires one original Murdoch media company realized enabled denialism fires grew worse, wrote letter colleagues. immediately fired letter scrubbed computer systems, supposed free speech crowd.

Whenever one grows conscience easy sweep rug world forgotten week later, often disaster caused getting worse. Sure. “easy fix” come **more money.** want out. Well necessarily immunity all, also long immunity last. immunity lasts 6 months would make sense would seeing reinfections Probably thing uncompromising Democrats Congress think: “I’m putting name unless also supports thing want” can’t that! look amount burns people touched stove people stoves! media scarier numbers report I've stopped caring stories. Tired people ignorant. response like 

&amp;#x200B;

 

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Fox bad though. CDC fumbled masks, they’ve pivoted good data exists pointing people wear masks. 

Trump, Fox co barely gotten board wearing mask. Imo, stronger response person saying masks debatable. 

There literally debate. Wear mask. 

If platform that’s engaged public you’re reminding people wear mask follow hygiene social distancing protocols, you’re part problem. Cremated someone 2 years ago TX $800. 

I read, calling BS story. lot cardiac conditions would need ECG part sports physical. y'all surprised? point banning political talk subject posted article politics. appears entire thing banned cannot talk article article politics. reported original article helps. mean make job harder appears someone targeting every post replying politics. Indeed, free market. It’s impossible corrupt government’s poor planning effect standard living! data UK months ago minorities represented deaths - even *doctors*.

Doesn't really matter are, doctors poor.

Several plausible mechanisms noted. Low vitamin apparently correlates worse infection. sunny UK, likely darker skinned people low default. There's also mention sickle cell gene African ethnicities carry higher percentages something clotting (but resists Malaria better), couple innate factors forgot little bank balance. Millenials young anymore. College kids young twenty somethings Gen Z. Look gompertz curve every single hard hit location, regardless lockdown. way virus acts quite predictable. herd immunity strategy like sweden did? one hand, risk death volunteer tiny real. hand, challenge trial could speed vaccine development production months, every single day cost thousands lives. would volunteer challenge trial available region, think moral balance clear, I'm impressed government (to best knowledge) forcing scientists challenge trial despite fact save billions dollars. mean it’s theory, sort pre-existing immunity/resistance else could cause huge decline cases deaths?

Its combination alot factors, would put money summer season, took alot longer Sweden catch rest scandinavia due cases. think go winter virus scandinavians celebrate success. Yaaaa live people believe that. Mississippi going get bad. Yeah, sadly think anyone saying bad cares graphs articles all. Unless talking masks work there'll chips vaccine, course. confronted articles like ""fake news."" Ah, man. Good luck. wanna ask 200k excess deaths include confirmed covid deaths extra 200k? I’ll take “upvoted old comments would get conservative subreddit banned” thousand dollars, Alex. Excuse me, 25 buck buy ingredients single meal? Still Windows 7, would consider death preferable another Windows upgrade. Wow sounds intense. Thank do. mom nurse always craziest stories, y'all rock stars. Good luck you. lol, yeah there's nothing between. either slavery abolishing prisons. real person? insight works I’m 98% sure it’s going play out. Fuck.  anti-mask family south delusional. uncle said doesn’t think virus real it’s conspiracy get Trump office “He doesn’t know anybody sick” 

Then continues say aunt got extremely sick weeks ago high fever, really bad cough, trouble breathing, loss taste. 

Did hear fucking said? problem people get infected bring home. Freedumb awards. Cool. wrong about? data suicides yet. fact final data increase non-covid related deaths.

You're epitome non-scientific, ideological thinking. Go play video games let adults talk. race dumbest corrupt always excused, even gleefully know upsets others. Makes wonder would’ve made without extra fat stores

Edit: gonna new excuse 20 Covid pounds I’ve put “They died covid covid” hope worth take stand? stubborn? Stick man? Whatever. Hope it’s worth it. remember seeing infection map end credits Planet Apes movie? look like that. Note voting mostly meaningless primary, (obviously) November general election. Ain't truth. Add fun actually getting covid ""recovering"" enough go go back work. right to, precision matters. Thank you. 8,500 new cases? That’s kinda low Florida lately. even mean... bro want cry im sick stupid virus another comment:

This also mention Oxford's vaccine passed safety trials far coronavirus Moderna working technology around eight years. Yeah, think maybe it’s phrasing? idiot Hacker News told heart attacks diabetes stuff, people going annual physicals. Oh Vitamin deficiency anxiety overreacting virus.

How talk someone like that? get new, novel, etc. kinda goes Virology 101 not? classic RNA viruses reinfect strain/variant within months initial infection? know flu past March (think flu), felt better 5 days, 3-4 days later felt horrible another week. strange others Covid feel fine get hit symptoms months later. wonder virus completely cleared/dormancy, etc. chance might multiple strains/variants? Can't catch flu a/b season? many pieces fecking puzzle.... makes sense since there’s currently FDA approved vaccines prevent flying. get flu shot. mean, surprise stupendously high rate school shootings, absolutely ZERO steps taken prevent more? republican party abandoned americans poverty, sickness, death. Par course. ""All individuals died [positive] covid point major medical problems prior contracting covid,"" Pounder wrote, adding majority older 75 many people died already terminal diagnosis kind.

“They would died anyway”, Facebook classic might time mandatory re-education courses requirement voting. let want opt so? 200,000 excess deaths US months virus keeps gaining steam.

But talking deaths schools open 'dramatic.' they're taking it, good news me. makes vaccine even cheaper. Savage good news tag dude  already happened, student coworkers going go back school speak management they’re longer going away school ‘Shuts Down’ pretty misleading. back fourth nobody really shut down. trump administration number dead 37 December. substantial minority? thought closer 35-40% ...wait let check trumps approval rating.. work China, neighbor Vietnam, colleagues China, UK, Philippines, South Africa, Caribbean, America, Kenya. talk lot. Everything see mentioned news corroborated - made up! chronic fatigue, brain fog still occasionally, sick March.

It's really strange, fucking annoying. Fortunately, seems going away. Or, least far less frequent 2 months ago. Preach! also mention Oxford's vaccine passed safety trials far coronavirus Moderna working technology around eight years. I've seeing varying reports suggest could go either way, bit concerning many indicated second infection relapse appear severe first least large fraction cases. made clear French paper, many patients COVID-19 recurrence died second bout, even among survivors, second case tended severe first. 

 

A guy Koreatown apparent reinfection case also said second time around much worse first.

 

Some researchers saying raises spectre antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), seen viruses like dengue seen SARS apparently, would greatly complicate many vaccine efforts. Apparently ADE hard detect would noticeable early vaccine trials, likely becoming evident longitudinal analyses year first studies data looked aggregate. also means it'll still difficult know sure aggravated recurrences among previously infected patients mean. Think earring, guess that's better? Somewhat possible. However, matter many asymptomatics have, spreads family 1 5 end severe symptoms, get hospitalized, followed later 1 500 deaths so. hosp deaths pretty low MN June/July, im fence. Trump: enough testing. Good you. I'm team living long can.

I getting vaccine first year two specifically reasons foresightfarsight mentioned.  Frankly speaking think better position January 21 better vaccine time. university commissioned home theater sales job FutureShop (Canadian version BestBuy BB purchased eventually shut brand) mislead people order line pocket. 

The top sales guys racking commission lying/misleading customers. #1 older charismatic guy made $110-130k/yr (cad) emptying customers wallets, pushing unnecessary products, services, warranties, accessories (ex. Monster cables), etc...

I resulted manager lecturing 'stats' time. sold enough get though (just top) honest getting repeat customers + referrals. 

That sales, can't imagine much sociopath mislead public resulting deaths overall stupidity nation. Even millions dollars. Herd immunity strategy Native Americans used got sick white colonists.

Didn't work them. Underlying condition? can’t even leave town get away noise! think considered hear thought highly unethical. challenge trial vaccinate someone purposely infect them. 

The reason thought unethical still much unknown it. really can’t tell live die live horrible symptoms afterwards. purposely tried infect someone may sentencing person death lifelong illness decided it. hate everyone thought good idea send children death beds like  Uhhh... far tell one mentioned GOP buddy. think I'm downvoted fully aware schools open US. I'm Lombardy, FWIW, schools closed end school year, though they're slated re-open September.

If people hitting downvote button helps release stress thinking school kids getting infected making bad situation worse causes, means I'm glad help. 2 14 days,  nearly everyone attending attends portion it, everyone attend 10 days.

Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Hanukkah  girl took pic got suspension reversed.  keep seeing sub shaming people hesitant covid vaccine, think reasonable cautious vaccine made less year. Vaccine development takes little decade complete, clinical trials, 3 phases testing, regulatory approval. We’re watch Russia skip practically every step give basically unproven vaccine. trust vaccine developers best can, huge risk missing something important, especially long term effects. Personally, I’d rather wait vaccine company like J&amp;J Moderna, that’s me.

By means think vaccine injected microchip paid bill gates, [but let’s allow history repeat public skeptical public health officials. can't get starting new trial volunteers received vaccine going exposed coronavirus. plot twist beginning post apocalyptic world. mean little bit both. still know little virus longer longer mutate become deadly. common denominator 2020 death unless take seriously large amount population doing.

Merci mon frère. La France manque tellement. I’m really defending thinking data stronger waves send, likely damage cells don’t research back claims this, it’s theory clearly testing intentionally lowered 8 billion people earth (approx) x $3 = 24 billion.

Just remember things, really don’t want part school administrator’s “science experiment”. science already there. tells us epidemic bringing group people live together indoor space lead virus spreading. computer models taught us reality. 

This social distancing guidelines begin minimize time spent indoors people don’t live with. Make trips store possible. indoors stay far away others. possible stay least 6 feet away. Wear mask protect others you’re infected unaware.

Every school administrator opening schools looking precise advice saying “but know sure?” come rules, “clever” hand waving tough questions movements hallways handling wearing masks presto open school claim done safely.

The reality handful students known sick. case seed exponential growth curve. school’s actions led deaths. modeling shows this. model doesn’t care opinion it. U.S. needed enough T.P. 300 million plus people now.


We've normally needed N95 type masks million people day, that. profession falls healthcare probably N95. due closely work patients. EMT's clinic doctors office receptionists.

In event, even flu, still fucking go risk getting infected know people infected. Maybe understand important education is? science clearly shows shutting schools much devastating opening them. March, two tweets lauding China’s handling outbreak liked reposted hundreds thousands times. posts shocking, funny newsworthy, originated users modest China lockdown
2. Italy got hit virus
3. misinformation campaign specifically targeted Italy China promoted measures stop virus, namely lockdown.

Here tweet fully expect read tell fuck off. Sorry: responding final sentence. Nevermind man, stupid even grasp conversation trying have.

I also love majority post history trying convince America stupid. covid real. Duh.  Well could prevented crybabies wanna wear masks. ignorant shits. I've despised entire life. I'm even gay, someone whose dealt continual nonsense around climate change teaching evolution schools. America militarily driven, health driven this? gf’s kid lice blue one day. told school notify parents check children refused name protecting privacy. “You don’t need say it, really let parents know check kids.” “We can’t that.” read EO? orders state pay 25% federal unemployment feds can't do. Also congress change money appropriated. Lastly judge need issue nationwide injunction stop money get vaccine ignore idiots again... considered irrational? well idea Man then, immediacy absolutely shocking seeing happen outside. said many times now, news coming America daily like poorly written, unbelievably ridiculous fiction. society surreal. Yeah believe that. talking IQ here, though believe little higher well? Anyways, that's irrelevant. I'm talking common sense. China example country. Work school district. custodians. nice. way hell “cleaning” way district advertising. way hell. art deal full effect one replaceable. Saw that. one data point. Hard know positive negative overall. Yeah that's easy. multiple cases released ""non-violent"" offenders turning violent offenders pretty quickly. top many released prisoners give 0 shits pandemic took 0 safety precautions - ended back jail started spreading like crazy seems wildly irresponsible, seeing know enclosed spaces transmit extremely effectively. Welcome freedom japan!


S/ far tell Minnesota, many mask orders either. know town south one shutting 30+ businesses week due infected employees, enforced. 

But lets real: really expect 100 officers police population 100k wear masks? saying would, even tried, they're seriously outnumbered. students suspended fact prognosticators realized posting image would get suspended, therefore making safe COVID Trump: ""But, saved 322 Million Americans die!"" I’m sorry think leg amputated corona rather cancer it. 1 case Toronto day....1 feel like there's undermeaning related old generations basically run country due biggest part population quite *old-fashioned* mind. within 2 weeks without school reopenings taken consideration yet. That's lot kids. interesting commentary exponential growth, cant tell title follow rules. many died causes combat. nice gesture Germany, showing leadership time crisis. 

I wonder pays foreigner gets hospitalized covid? one hand, country responsibility pay treatment another country's citizens. hand, want foreigners avoid going hospital walking around spreading covid afraid cost. You’re wrong that.

I’ve staying home smoking poles. Roosevelt's New Deal met resistance right wing but...there Twiiter FB tell people programs obviously help really hurts them. Talking friends Medicine telling 70% folks ICU rural counties Bexar County Hospitals someone literally criticised BLM protest supporters subreddit use phrase ""no risk"", also wish US politics would stay Reddit disagree overpoliticising issues, completely disagree actually believe politicising issue here.

I agree protesters all. said:

Some masks offer protection tear gas. masks useful spread COVID. lack masks usually due availability affordability. support protests refuse criticise using every safeguard. 

Meanwhile, protest COVID measures following COVID measures. exist solely flout protections place. refuse wear mask want to. wish protest COVID lockdowns masks, eyes, right follow COVID safety measures so.

In simple English, politics: BLM protesters likely follow COVID safe precautions anyone protesting COVID safe precautions. Israel: ""Really? Hold arak..."" 9 90 soon. on, on, on...oh boy. Ok let's honest. wh lying hospitalizations states governors certain party lying deaths. Better? Yeah, even government fucks every way imaginable, America least better 100 years ago. Progress! Source? might misremembering I'm Ontario Canada definitely people still birthday parties get together like normal. Yeah, issue totally underestimated people even mild cases inflammation heart muscle possible scarring heartmuscle, lungs. Interesting likely depressing. Agreed. time leaders need shine show bad are. Come November voting everyone position, democrat republican. Yep, lot people go church think Christians. aren’t. Neither rest country, government. knew anything government works, would understand federal government wastes billions upon billions dollars year pouring money programs don’t turn profit. Like military? public housing? subsidizing flood insurance? public schools? FDIC? FBI? Tennessee Valley Authority? seriously trying debate this, yet clue wasteful government spending is? None programs listed ever turn profit, yet government keeps pouring money them. LOL yeah I’ll take drug test, think might exposed I’ll quarantine two weeks take test. What’s skin game? always see posting schools need re-open children don’t spread it, what’s agenda? Sell school clothes? shortage materials make HEPA filters though? I’m sorry pessimistic world view. show children primary cause spread. make assumptions guesses best. People rounding up. US WWII December 1941 September 1945 Japan officially surrendered.

Pardon french thing supervisor work said father tested positive. fans drinking Jesus soon enough top densely packed area spread rural area. comparisons worthless. can’t compare war pandemic terms deaths.

Great Depression Eisenhower didn’t give free money people. used government projects departments create jobs stimulate economy. Seemed work okay back then. health department admins school go fully online, don't, yeah basically murder point. 69% statistics made up. wrong WWII??

^sarcasm Lol, ikr? It’s like alcoholics fool themselves: “Sure, fell bar stool, I’m bad guy,” (and gestures guy vomiting woman’s lap) 😆 we(the US) getting ripped apart covid. stand tracks, feel vibrations, hear horn, see train coming round corner, *stand like fucking idiots act surprised runs us over*. can't wait virus spread taking action. Remember Bernie made statement everyone thought nuts projected death toll million lock down. locked projected two million hospitals overwhelmed. Well, stupid, surely senseless? Preposterous? Absurd? 3 kids identified gifted. One gifted exceptionalities.

In every case consulted committee consisting teacher, spec Ed school board rep. teacher actually wrote EIP along us. read One Gets Alive, I'm sure Jim Morrison would anti-mask. plus side constant tardiness would probably lower likelihood infecting anyone. yet, school districts across country still planning full-on reopenings, included. childrens' lives talking here, mention teachers amd families want live see kids grow up. 
 People seriously messed up. Beijing entered conversation You’d think would obvious, enough nurses staff situations arise someone dispatched deal immediately, “productivity” profit driving forces American healthcare. It’s abomination. Everyone’s going get spaniard, Madrid. read newspapers watch news TV daily havent heard anything like this. wait 18th september? think situation currently bad. sounds like fake new. aware Latin America neighbor, make problem. Countries need support help themselves. knew anything economy, would see head recession anyway, pouring billions billions dollars countries literally nothing return hurt United States. Right. That’s thing worries me...The second tweeted safe children back school knew wasn’t safe children go back school. 

I think motive even it’s safe want people get economy sake. like gave wearing masks sure won’t help convince people fence getting it. Unfortunately that's truth. Nope. Thank goodness ain't you. people coming back hometown days tell it. John George alive Paul Ringo. folks thinking dividing population area country explains why.

Sure country land mass huge, almost one lives arctic, 50% population lives south US states Yeah would honestly wait safe, personally wouldn’t trust vaccine November. Oxford vaccine development decade. started SARS. Fsf.org encourages encryption stop bulk surveillance. I'm looking page right now.

So see power hungry really paranoid overreacting power flexing yelling kids easy ""looks like"" job old WASP board members. Actually give many thoughts US. US ruining economy also means hardship us. They're deferred year People deciding whether news fake based whether like news - thing anti-maskers New Zealanders still wearing masks?

I extremely dissappointed individuals (or large groupings people) little regard other's lives. sorry ill-informed/decieved pandemic happening. hope pray people start coming thier senses get people killed. also helps many false positives, people must get moved cured list instead lowering positives list. Every time comes up, needs pointed many pro-vaccine people want sure vaccine safe rushed testing. Maybe given time understand long term effects it, any. government throwing money get scientists doctors working it, rush testing phase.

I think antivaxxer issue, people common sense concerned safety vaccine rushed masses fraction time usually takes create new vaccine. nice, comparison would like average person throwing couple quarters salvation bin jug. December they'll busy booking tickets foreign countries avoid facing consequences terrible job adults take I'm outside Toronto, last Sunday heading bus stop work, four police cars parked parking lot right behind stop.

""Pre-existing"" anti-masker anti-vaxxers call that.

Granted keep moving goal posts.


Any bullshit excuse antisocial medical science luddites. know would target rich people poor Latino family small Bible study? 300,000 dead single year countless hospitalized seems pretty serious. Especially immunity last short period time people survived year might survive next year. read it, specifically searched connection lockdown.

That’s right, fuck misinformation. deaths likely counted cases. Almost a-symptomatic cases counted. Yet deaths tested now. 
It’s way 3.3%. irrelevant starving 100%. 

Look don’t care honestly. don’t blame parents governments failure welfare everybody. *approved* vaccine mid 2022 earliest. Right get that, guess think situations reversed - study 20,000 people said huge risk amongst kids single camp social distancing significant increased risk spread - would trust more? 
 
I’m saying it’s definitive isn’t “reading sub thinking know scientists” Unless alls lobbyists execs list forget it.

Insurance, even best policies, expensive maintain. Beside deductible coinsurance premium.  notion structures destroyed every 5–10 years ridiculous. time structures destroyed town takes direct hit category four category five hurricane, exceptionally rare. Or, tree falls structure minor hurricane, something like that. seems theory coastal towns America constantly destroyed rebuilt hurricanes, simply isn’t true. Hurricanes damaging think are.

For example, lived city evacuated approaching hurricane. least 80% residents left. hurricane category five Sea, actually hit area, category one, got outer bands. results: 25 mph winds moderately heavy rain two hours. it. vast, vast majority hurricane experiences like this. 

Yes, powerful, destructive hurricanes indeed happen rare. Didn’t get first one, won’t get one. y’all bitching got one it’s enough... Unfortunately, endpoint. milepost. based way it’s written I’m taking comments mean wish virus 99,6% mortality rate would mean would virus’ properties (transmissibility, asymptomatic period, etc... 99,6% people got ended dying).

Then read entire comment rest comments well. Can't help citizens think help others. good time write letters friends Florida. Especially social ones Definitely listen happy music do. Japan's population 130 million. find people believing sorts things. important question **the number dumbasses per capita**. 

I wonder America's dumbasses per capita compared rest world. everything ""Paul"" inside degenerate dangerous humankind. Sad truancy comes back parents though. Yeah, original comment saying never get normal again.

Social distancing isn’t normal. continue vaccine, that’s depressing world. need it. I’m rough Sunday. Testing Germany also mostly done out-of-hospital labs, run commercial companies. companies instrumental built capacity govt concerned issue.

The problem US testing outbreak big, cannot procure resources (swabs, machines, reagencies, personnel) keep testing keeping outbreak. photos Georgia prove that's happening. 

Plus, must nice well funded schools even attempt that. States Broke Many Eyeing Massive Cuts. Here's NOTHING DONE! JESUS SAVE US! *Sips Bud Light crowded patio shoulder shoulder people mask seen* Agreed. interesting see situatuon plays out. Smoking anything make vulnerable badly afflicted covid Tool....and tickets. point funny happens. never check restart computer time though? Channeling grief preventable death action prevent future deaths healthy heroic. might benefit community, I’d argue primary benefit person grieving.

I understand explaining grieving people seems wrong, however context blatant, continuous broadcasts misinformation coming people power caused death. Helping clarify that, despite message broadcasts, death *was* preventable people caused *can* held accountable legitimate way support grieving people. got hand. apologise.  hate us cause ain’t us.  Ok well maybe saying different things. you’re saying wish virus instead Ebola Zaire (or something insane mortality rate could stopped early it, see point trying made). based way it’s written I’m taking comments mean wish virus 99,6% mortality rate would mean would virus’ properties (transmissibility, asymptomatic period, etc... 99,6% people got ended dying). latter case would absolutely death civilization I’m sure know work infectious diseases Username checks out. someone gets pissed social worker disrupting party pulls gun? vaccine likely approved US around years repurposed covid. going trials multiple regulatory agencies third party services monitoring release. government needs better job educating people phase three trial compete turns safe effective. peer reviewed articles published trials concern seems efficiency vaccine rather safety. 

More likely 100,000’s people get vaccine months us able to. realize won’t know effects let’s say 10 years I’m professional field know enough whether issue not. mean ever know vaccine someone 30 years it’s administered? ""This Account Suspended""

YAY! Well people think nothing claim billions die China. Schools Oklahoman here. started school last week. 3rd grade teacher said masks use believe virus. think. many people like think. want daddy government govern harder, exact opposite whatever people smarter them(Dr's) tell ""Muh freedums!"" dont know whats infectious. corona virus idiocy people Ooh really part *love?* Please disappear ass. US help poor people country first. people struggling. Dude bro  Good analogy. know happens children get coddled. become nightmare adults. bad lots bikers overweight health problems they’ll probably severe cases catch it. Wow, know like states legalized it? Cash Pope It’s unstoppable don’t believe science. still read you? mean practical make money it. wrong exactly? Good.
I’m tired people thinking they’re law; laws don’t incentivize people start wearing masks, maybe monetary penalties will. Shit. go again. show finally wearing mask. entire bubble led anti-mask wearing one symbol wrong he/they along Terrible spa workers community. good hedonistic started party... people MDR-1 mutation? know ivermectin kill dog MDR-1 mutation.  We’ve already changed behavior, masks social distancing, limited capacity bars/restaurants, etc. assumed happen worst models get touted sub. sure? We're talking Spanish flu right? Unless talking America. 

According history Spanish flu pandemic 1918, deadliest history, infected estimated 500 million people worldwide—about one-third planet's population—and killed estimated 20 million to 50 million victims, including some 675,000 Americans.Oct 12, 2010 ""It's unstoppable!""

*[refuses press brakes]* think explicitly stated. US cases number, deaths daily increase that's embarrassing honestly. Sure, Brazil India well moment either. Still... country claims 'best' world, plain embarrassing. USA! USA! USA! whole ""it's flu"" bs even make sense. Thee flu still deadly even die get seriously sick take weeks feel fully normal again. Honestly already wearing masks, social distancing extent, ffs everyone getting flu shot  K earlier post say ""a mortality rate 0.1-0.5%""?

Now saying ""it puts mortality rate around 1.2%"". Like, why? phase 3 trial 30,000 people remember correctly. 15,000 actually getting vaccine. That's going demonstrate every possible negative reaction. want data. honestly I'm bothered health care workers, police, military, especially vulnerable get general public. 

More data come that. Thats great! good luck trying convince hords stupid Americans believe fake meme facebook masks vs academic report. Americans lack reading writing comprehension. send America tourists around world spreading corona virus? would way aren’t even allowed visit reasonable country.

Not tourists, military personnel. American military personnel subject rules civilians. Japanese upset US military bases spreading covid. Many universities courses face-to-face directly due pressure complaints students. I'm sure parent poster saying road trip worse biker rally, still necessarily safe going road trips plenty people well. Also, would think rest areas restrooms would mostly empty? mean it’s probably possible, side bell curve mother. know bullshit says poses ""no risk"". scientist worth salt would speak absolutes. Admittedly uncomfortable. *Yawn*. what's point? never hide American. would pretend right now? get laughed world? Hang Trump! agree, wish article enumerated clearly. That's also rounded down. 

7 8 counties area rural county WKU (Warren county/ city Bowling Green) also actually considered rural Bowling Green 3rd highest population center KY (not saying much tbh) mean we’ll hit point many dead social distancing byproduct people left country. they’ll start giving away jobs, houses cars. works? [already actually way serious making people wear them. 

""[mask could face fines, prison times even publicly shamed newspapers names getting published.

So ""modern drugs machines"", apparently also way ""modern"" idiots smart people scared forcing what's right. obtain way rest us it. virtually. It’s hard understand. They’re alcoholics. Don’t get Russia who’s actually pulling Tumps strings. talking Latin America, Middle East, idiot. haven’t bombed Latin America. Money doesn’t grow trees, dumping billions dollars nations incapable taking care foolish, especially impending recession horizon. fairness, isolation help, lot ppl can't deal long term solitude ppl started going places opened little. work alone weekends pretty much stay home alone week. would simple thing see anyone wanted to. However understand ppl can't this. 

Like another commenter said, area Jersey highly infected comes out, I'll consider getting it, however see reason wait months. ""if stopped testing, cases would go down!""  death toll already devastating. think change behavior December? It’s four months. Closer 6 could maybe argue 7, lying saying four detracts absolutely terrible cost pandemic Trump’s response. anti-maskers care scientific proofs, anything scientific ? is.

I've got it. Well call memorial day ""it day"" out. 1. remember having* arguement.
2. one angrily telling people mental illness.

Have fun getting angry strangers. fine along grandma grandpa dying? Computer simulation Didn’t intend say all. It’s definitely men women that’s creating hard times us all. Look Karens! 

It quote someone else thought rings true (I change quote/gender always interpret “men” humans here) showing we’re cycle (i.e. lot people good times past decades creating bad times next generations). Y’all ridiculous. say s*** like this?

It *clearly* Hunter Biden. mean bunch afghans ak47s explosive beat US. military might rated ""Just sprinkle racism war rhetoric. forget this."" Ireland banned Schengen agreement continue let Americans in. “It is.” I’d interest see total number people died say jan1 till year compared last year. drastically covid? people dying less things like car crashes people staying home resulting similar death count. case, game would far hard enjoyed. They'd restructure LOT game. might pollen allergies noticed masks help them, not. help me, fact. outdoor work backyard summer, mask typical allergy season quite nice.  gift keeps giving /s You’re right subjective perspectives.

The commenter suggesting WW3 due global acts espionage economic/cyber attacks undertaking time. quite bit global unrest world much “fighting” done different way.

You absolutely right stating rest world suffered far WW2 United States you’re point (as know) goes well beyond casualty count. People torn families, entire cultures nearly wiped out, rape destruction rampant Asia, Africa, Europe. disgusting scene truly battle survival freedom fascism; freedom ability establish form governance allowed people power. virus cannot leave body, people catch covid first place? stay inside along seniors. stay completely safe. don’t worry anything contagious. situation choice one way other. go work, buy groceries. one interact wears masks store employees. I'm 40s diabetic. I'm teen ""just get it"" someone could afford even time go hospital get virus. assessment situation die get virus, one gives damn anything protect it. One family members wife supposed go Sturgis weekend. went cabin several friends instead... allegedly. still really stupid right now.

They’re late sixties prime covid fatality range. 

A couple us, including myself, think actually went Sturgis lied it. boomers used life prosperity whatever TF want do. fact halfway 5 months pretty good indicator poorly government handled this. Omg. That's. That's awful. That's literally wasting efforts. Groundhogs day them? Best wishes you. Exactly! Go hiking, find secluded beach... substitute Texas make $75 per day Bachelor’s degree. I’ve already worked first three days school scheduled next three days. 😬 

Wish luck, y’all! Generally true always crazies, unfortunately percentage people convinced virus fake least wildly overblown way high country. Notice CDC definition testing positive, April, require real test suspicion virus.


It's bunch words otherwise I'd copy paste here. Obviously, degree protection varies lot. Besides said earlier, FPF2 N95 masks work overwhelmingly well. Tissue masks really protective chirurgical masks work okay also thrown trash much faster. COVID-19 also infect eyes, rarely fully protected. That's laughable. GP worth penny knows kids go back school, whatever virus among community spikes. literally happens _every year_.

Surely SARS-CoV-2 follow pattern... transmissible flu sit corner play nice schools /s people care this? guess I'm missing something USING ANTIBODY TEST IDIOT assuming daily death rate increase winter joke comment. say long term complications virus may reactivate future? Personally, don’t think even felons disenfranchised. wrong / wrong, don’t think render voiceless democracy. believe disenfranchising undemocratic. Now, shunning — that’s style. I’m New England; maybe it’s regional thing 😜 Well what's population county? thinking well. Thats first mistake everyone makes plague inc, make virus deadly quickly even manage get Madagascar. think given larger government support education, permanent contracts safer work environment care staff, hope make profession get attention (and respect salary) deserves, unskilled-temp work replacements described happened regular staff started getting sick March. certified nurses homes, certainly, qualification certification make staff eligible provide treatment (when prescribed doctor, course). obvious always need consultancy, read resident doctor sometimes end situation doctor give assessment patient based phone conversation nurse only, without ever seen patient medical history. sure common is, know also standard home country. also read sort ""consultancy"" doctor starts make fuss something, next time nursing home calls another. lack consistency follow-up general advice. Respect parents. Get room two. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) population thousands infected student that's lot asymptomatic cases... Obviously, people care rights, anybody else's. Correct points. Reagan start. elected b-movie actor. came Newt Gingrich ridiculous Congress, turning things insane. Bush 43 Neocons lied us colonial war mideast, refused regulate banks watched implode. reality-tv conman crooked way head we're paying price. volunteered. think. least did. wore BLM shirt songs, think means virus can't spread.  Them's rules, clearly say people coming 2 weeks self-isolate 14 days still choose come, that's us. hope didn’t purpose 400k us soldiers died ww2. Please fix post logic substance arguments know right, try paint crazy. really immature pathetic. Good day sir. can’t that! 5'10, assume? How? send America tourists around world spreading corona virus? would way aren’t even allowed visit reasonable country. 'the complete lack of' variety logic. nobody going point graph article shows US whole dropping 29% FL 26%? Comparatively, FL terrible. looked May lockdowns still effect. get involved approached first asked information, justify things falsehoods given others.

That’s good point respect qualification. Don’t people take Lyme Disease? googled, looks like WWII claimed 400k lives? isnt enormously insignificant amount deaths gonna go mortality rate here, thought pretty well establish mild asymptomatic cases. 

But example, Stockholm randomized testing 1,000 people March found 10% infected COVID-19. models say 17% something infected now. total population 1 million 2,400 deaths, puts mortality rate around 1.2%. cases basically stopped Stockholm, last death 10 days ago possible even higher percentage mild asymptomatic cases, given there's masks shutdown people roam around public transport like normal. eviction moratoriums soundly ignored local state governments.

But landlords ignore therefore still relief would otherwise homeless.

And important make distinction federal vs state. CARES Act designed prevent foreclosures. applicable participated federal housing programs. state responsible state level legislation protecting everyone else.

Look, argument seems EO helps falls short. agree. hope Congress step carry home.

But level aid relief previously exist receive - important. Dude painstakingly explained going take months set special vehicles $400 trumpaid

You provided one example immediate. provided several were. I'm wrong brought immediate change wrong provisions likely going help many several months all. numbers insane. clearly plan anywhere except NBA bubble. rest country throwing people numbers giant equation death Hopefully can't enter european Schengen area appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* flesh colored ones know people complained people asking protests? 

Well here, asked bars restaurants. please denounce well? Settling long hall. Went second test last week, still negative National Guard wearing goggles.... I'm expecting deal least next summer say completion phase 3 trials, analysis data. ya, doesn’t mean good idea take vaccine, good thing know fully informed. People scared talking nuances fear stoking anti-vaxxers, say sweeping things like rug long-run fuel anti-vaxxers.

I always say. Educate, don’t manipulate. Fauci sometimes manipulating, educating. people don’t trust him, part reason anti-authority sentiment USA. worst thing can't change stupidity others... Idiotas early dichotomy established: suppression v economy.

By Trump also deniers. wanted believe economy hindered meanie governors. 

Turns there's real problem behind that! Maybe wipe tears masks refuse wear. JFC

The audacity still thinking right despite many people take time sundays calmly explain missing. Still gotta comment though! r/China_Flu leaking. many, they're hospital friend family member dies. real affects personally. Florida teacher unions fighting back weeks. litigation process shit show poster personally voted folks problem? take kindly accusation. Ummm...................you sent message quoting text even write............

Did intend sending me? even know content message was....... that's people forgetting/ignoring morbidity side things. disagree arrest warranted, man certainly put mask on. actually started enforce [this became obvious homeless man alone behavior. I'm sure would others weeks homeless man arrested actual enforcement going on. 

But moving right direction people starting wear masks Broadway, that's good. Doubtful. Death rates place questioned start. That's people looking things like excess deaths instead. see arguing masks anywhere?  I'm taking rushed vaccine, slave away company. Adjusted population (136.7M vs 331M) duration (1365 days vs 185 days), COVID-19 currently deadlier Americans WWII (2.7 deaths/million pop/day vs 2.2 deaths/million pop/day).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, 40-60 percent infected estimated asymptomatic. would triple safe, say 15 million. Still long way herd immunity. well said, sides sound anti-scientific.  
 Striking Florida means lose teaching license. So. Greece done well right wing country Yea, it’s fucked up. forget need “/s” days. one player many? 🥴 believe it. think news clip company head bought ferrari lambo covid payouts business?  Yes, that's allow kids play street run around thunderstorm. ounce prevention worth pound cure. much mask weigh again? Also seeing adults brazenly care kill poor decisions. way value human life. I’m glad luxury. Unfortunately quit run risk losing house DEFINITELY lose healthcare pension I’ve paying years LOL hopefully start better pandemic next weeks schools push shit up. like germnay. numbers rise next weeks. sad using children labor rats. school opening one worst things could do...

good luck get better president K I’m actually floored teams even get insurance cover players. used date pro hockey player, got injured. MRI injury, discovered born one kidney. team could insure him, could longer play. 

What actuaries recommending commercial liability health care insurers it’s ok send players back field? It’s MF madness. bet make players sign waiver- SICK. Mars closed travel, too. Sorry. Thank you, sub front time subbed there.

As retail worker stress public enough like founded hopes individualistic landowners, craftsmen merchants, pay taxes keep themselves, finally morphed state served said interests. 6 months?

You really concerned effect less 1 5k~15k chance happening? outlier family members anyone circle going bars restaurants. live liberal Midwestern city part everyone good. I'm sure there's still irresponsible people around think majority trying best. Morons. Sure, clean school top bottom, limiting liability enhancing PR, right? one kid carrying virus, mixing population one wearing mask absolutely failure lead highest order. Malfeasance. Cowards. I’m talking closing school. I’m talking suspending threatening students. wasn’t board reversed decision, astronomical amount public outrage. Ontario 981 active cases total well also wrong immediately count deaths occurring 3 months test. even counting accidents.  Bringing anecdotal outliers like Broadway guy silly. too. read title thought ""poor muffin"", I'm glad read entire article got true meaning Here’s works NSW normal person’s perspective:

Positive case found. history taken.

Each venue provides sign sheets, every group people contacted. Depending venue exposure time either Close contacts need self-isolate 14 days, casual contacts need extra careful symptoms. Test results usually within 24hr.

Venue names published hospitals get asked getting tested you’ve visited them, mentioned news.

Then venue closes time period.

Finally there’s tracing app, certain effective is. Last checked 25% people installed.

I don’t get feeling goal contact everyone every situation, spread awareness.

Usually 5-15 cases day (population 7.5mil), we’ll see next weeks look like... least January 2021. mean, still screw up. countries managed wacky useless death count. necessarily. study came recently talking COVID may able block pain receptors therefore people believe asymptomatic may truly asymptomatic.

Link: ...I thought said it.....50% 25% come enough contact it. Maybe covid, allergies. short anti maskers think COVID overblown. think death rate 1% shouldn’t changing lives. don’t want inconvenienced masks. It’s selfishness guise liberty. HATE people say this... would said year ago parents putting kids school? advocating either way, acting like parents don’t love kids shitty max. Kids supposed social interact kids age, parents people also need space. situation extremely stressful parents, constructive sit back make inflammatory comments parents need support families. working mother, don’t want spend time kids, fulfills human, mother. That's commentators expect vaccine approved. hard part production distribution, far people shockingly trustful government fucked everything far fuck vaccine distribution either douse alcohol.   
And water.   
And many shit foods eat.   
Nicotine addictive fuck.  show real scientific proof damages u worse legal drugs like sugar alcohol quite literally explicit predictions immediacy case leave vote, unbelievably wrong. get make prediction, give time frame, get disastrously wrong shift goal posts. kneeling! know someone works Vaccines told takes years vaccine tested approved. think talk COVID vaccine pacify us isn’t huge world freak out. vaccines tested ready side effects could happen years now. scary situation either way beginning horror movie. It’s gonna quick solution vaccine like Contagion movie people hoping for! sorry, fighting rhetoric posturing, combat problem rhetoric posturing own. pretend CFR IFR scare people.

you quoted CFR entire post discussing IFR.

In long well detailed post discussing confusing CFR IFR kind misinformation makes people take problem seriously.

Think that. self-preservation technique simply ignore discount bad. harm done public whole individuals acting way terrible, however consider individuals themselves. would mental blessing able live without fear COVID people seem pulling off. know lot anger, resentment, judgement given towards people behaving recklessly; cursed felt disgust ways. Maybe another part human condition though way envy them. _must_ travel least take responsibility [consider kills 1% people old

oh good 3 million dead. people can't even assed basic arithmetic. wanna denial. wonder stand recite Pledge Allegiance onto person front them. sad neocortex 2-2.5 inches thicker nearest evoluntionary relatives yet still act like bunch damn animals. Nope, everyone becoming mentally numb numbers.😔 agree people want get back business usual. next decade we're going really major repercussions climate change think covid disaster smaller scale version that's going look like. Many want go back normal late now. OP fully quotes sources they're prestigious yours. Swing miss, must change opinion. Atlantic, that's works. leave people broke developing Cancer. leave people without kids go fight wars reasons made up. leave people homeless standing employer abuse. let kids go hungry parents going rough financial time. depraved. Great advice, course. will.  

But that's many people it, steal election. Hypernormalization.

*Everything Forever, More* Alexei Yurchak; book talks process occurring later stages Soviet Union.

In effect, glasnost allowed Soviets see rot hidden lies, thus glasnost began widescale awareness fact Soviet Union already collapsing. liken coronavirus crisis US glasnost Soviet Union- demonstrate rot hidden beneath veil legitimacy. post twitter? Probably.  No. think reprehensible, apparently board got reversed.

But totally separate manner, totally different thing, suspect permission close school. agree many seen yet, article yesterday Mayo Clinic doctor talked first patient don’t know enough yet. 5-7 months studying it. really idea yet. Yes, strap must wide wider four fingers acceptable. got daughter ona Matilda Jane dress second grade. Sent home cardigan lost found buttoned way top. Broke heart. Okay question. Say group 20 people yesterday, get tested today Covid? need wait days getting tested? 

If get tested day after, results accurate? said - true - PCR covid tests. Very, rare false positives, ones read caused mix contamination swabs. governor using quick antigen test good false positives. least know eliminating sports return University focus education. least people graduated 50th percentile. Brazil pretty large population living slums well unfortunately. large India, still. Karens Kyles I’ve heard Woaaaah we’re half way theeere
Woaaaah livin prayer talking about. happen little school environment. “projected” calm idiots, don’t get excited certainly looks unstoppable nothing try stop Im Canada, thankfully U.S. party yesterday. Around 16-18 people. one wearing mask. Got shit close friends nothing offended me. respected wearing it. Can't imagine States rn. realize US 10x larger population Canada, right? Yes true unfortunate. least good PPE. wife nurse covid unit months gets tested every week. Still gotten sick. That's say disproportionately kills stupid. Okay question. Say group 20 people yesterday, get tested today Covid? need wait days getting tested? 

If get tested day after, results accurate? Oh okay, thanks explanation. Fuckwads  can’t full stadiums outdoor concerts? ""This unstoppable""

*Laughs New Zealand* write article poll without link poll itself? 

53% voted certain likely, 16% voting definitely unlikely. 31% people? “snitches get stitches” “bitches end ditches”! Kind explains wars, bad faith trade negotiations, spreading ""democracy"", oozing influence American Corporations, CIA military industrial complex: 

Chop legs suddenly tall. think meant Easter 2112, Solar Federation liberated. number travelers low, density low total population area bigger US population similar Texas. different type test. PCR tests covid almost zero false positives governor tested quick antigen test - much less reliable. needed PCR test confirm result - PCR test turned negative twice showing first, quick antigen test wrong. Hey fuckwad, catch obesity others? No? take analogy shove lard ass. looking final insult send generation off- That's exactly people said couple months ago 1968/1969 Hong Kong flu killed 100,000 Americans, yet 160,000.

Never compare active situation vs one that's done decades. Yes makes sense. hope mask wearing social distancing actually serving make last longer. appears Sweden might taken correct approach. Oh yeah dude EMS room snacks hit different see active cases per capita state country? surge counted hundreds new cases tens thousands certainly thousand death day. could time virus shedding onset serious symptoms long. small group affected high transmission rate. Okay question. Say group 20 people yesterday, get tested today Covid? need wait days getting tested? 

If get tested day after, results accurate? Lol looking submission history, that's real pot calling kettle black 

The ratio age dependent. clearly worked didnt Right. big pre-election fight conjure another $1T another $3.4T. not? It’s like anyone 60 going pay it. sad truth American public cares itself, immediate family. Everyone else expandable. worst part pandemic hitting black &amp; brown communities 50% twice hard white counterparts. back many white Americans' minds, there's notion they're relatively safe since health problem that's mainly affecting colored ppl. Europeans realize US become much divided racial &amp; class lines past decade. Many value others' lives equally. got lot awesome movies watch isolating home! Radiohead guess means event Georgia never happened. maybe anyway? I'm people getting hoist petard unfortunate fact hits poor communities harder rich ones

So, yes, surface older voters susceptible...agreed

But people truly responsible hold multi acre estates Interestingly 200K actual died 'in civil war' due injuries, 400k died diseases. understand sanitation diseases spread. Kind ironic current situation. don't. stop moving goalposts.

""we can't say trump working russia without evidence!""

""Okay, here's evidence""

""nooo like that, admit putin also admit it, otherwise count!"" mean requiring masks make safe people public, travel place place, eat out, work... would save economy FREEEEDDDOOOOOMMMMMM. Americans care? Facebook feed filled people gathering weddings, cookouts, birthdays, going drinking etc... applied one (we military, living state) last election never got all. I'd rather vote mail, I'm sure want risk it.  enemy enemy enemies enemy, nothing more, nothing less.

That said, least arent sitting back nothing. agree colour choice kid-friendly, timing off. get mean horned god - I've never seen associated death only. symbolise duality everything? Life death, dark light... decision. life house. one forcing anyone attend one forcing anyone mingle strangers anywhere might attending parties. 

Indeed know spreads: touching sick people short-range droplet expulsion almost exclusively. aerosols contaminated surfaces. read stuff, that's OK. is: 

So stay home, stay inside forever want. avoid people. That's business. Everyone else want. one forcing (within feet right face, public), medical facilities, outbreak reports related indoor crowded spaces (40) suggested possibility aerosol transmission, combined droplet transmission, example, choir practice (7), restaurants (41) fitness classes.(42) events, short-range aerosol transmission, particularly specific indoor locations, crowded inadequately ventilated spaces prolonged period time infected persons cannot ruled consistent evidence SARS-CoV-2 contamination surfaces survival virus certain surfaces, specific reports directly demonstrated fomite transmission. acknowledge data-based FACT absolutely none major protests caused local outbreaks?

Hard know, contact tracers instances told ask person attending protests. case idea talking ""silver bullet"" - even miracle one companies able produce vaccine effective enough fight thing end year, federal government dumpster fire right now, confidence distributed efficiently end hands Joe Schmoe well 2021. no, holding breath vaccine, people need learn live restrictions indefinitely. Scandinavia, US fuckin' A, explicitly tell people idiots, idiots wonder nobody told to.

OK basically thinking world fire hide ages. Good luck ya! ~1700 players reference, around 4% Using English language would suffice. Unfortunately, that. CDC's official recommendations 2019 lock down, close schools. WHO. pandmic far worse scales one. reason changed China.

Also, ad hominem exactly call doing? Here’s thing; Japan, already culture wearing mask *when flu* (when cold well). So, statement may seem bad; wearing mask much bigger deal (assuming know infected). considered rude go mask-less, know sick - now, course, sticking point. COVID could asymptomatic much longer cold flu. So, objection probably mask mandate public spaces. rhetoric pretty ridiculous Japan, though. would convincing argue mask based “not sick”. man, don’t mean insensitive approach sounds extremely unhealthy. It’s important get outside, get sun, stay active.

Getting gas isn’t risky. You’re within 15 feet anyone typically, want extra careful wear glove sanitize hands after. You’re also outside, somebody walking past 2 seconds going infect unless cough sneeze directly face. 

I promise it’s healthier get safe things minimal risk like hiking, rather staying home 6 months year straight. say hoax? I'm saying numbers bs US. No, administration said was, ""Why spend money put money pockets?"" back grocery myself. Family coughing children cloth masks (shouldn't stay home symptomatic?!), half people store wearing nose chin straps. went parking lot entire family masks leisurely bicycle tour. one N95. Everyone knows secret good sarcastic joke *clinical accuracy*. always generalize people? Tell thoughts make conclude 360 plus million Americans selfish outlooks. system perfect. American tell us citizens perfect. Please do. American urge vote however think improve country. make difference Americans selfish suggest. 

Anyone makes blanket statement like ignored. part problem trying make us look like terrible people. Cause death: insufficient freedom! Imagine made laws hire Americans jobs pay fairly give good working conditions. if? BS claims backed up, hey, **lazy** unable so... LOL sure ok 🤷‍♀️ still purchase teaching supplies herself. also wash hands going bathroom

I co-worker regularly walked right restroom taking leak. reasonably intelligent guy sloppy means. get could this. 140% right. #DonTheCon blocking data communication medical science experts.  loud-mouthed, lowest-common-denominator minority

Every country that, denominator rather large. comparisons meaningless. real comparison excess mortality number average number deaths given time period. may still higher comparing war something else sensational bullshit.  they’re covered Jesus’ blood. /s wish recorded it. amount times happens far low.

Gots gets dem damned darkies tho. (Said sterotypical southern accent) trying help them, quite literally spit faces. I'm gonna make sick trying change Karen's mind masks, older mother home. instead help children Karen's dragged protests, nip bud next generation. 

Im happy deaths. I'm happy people's claiming virus exist, die 2 weeks later. sucks, duly, SEVERELY, warned, matter would listen. cruel irony, unless ready lock people insane asylums, continue spreading thier idiotic mindset, there's damn thing  Idiot tourists 

Stay home   Wrong, could asymptomatic spreading it, get symptoms while, gets worse die. agree. sure schools open UK state fall. give 6 months people tired restrictions beg vaccine. clump cells well. things normal ""clump cells"" become adult. separates fetus baby? life begin? might coma expected recover, mean kill conscious. usually mask indoors only, unless there's big crowd outdoors. I'm going buddy's house mask there. Usually stores theory yes, one main reasons family extended period time, frequent visits probably dissimilar staying here, feels almost pointless Ontario see often. article talking pupils cohort school environment R number schools potentially &lt; 0   know, I’m sorry pain, whole mess, I’m presence health care worker it’s almost always I’m hospital tests treatment, know lot health care workers suffered benefit, feel need thank them. get point, won’t stop appreciation. I’m happy leave war metaphor though. hero part, they/you are. tumor. think seem outcome aftermath Nov election fairly call US failed state. It’s fair comparison, long note caveat Covid on-going. It’s much better comparison war casualty. Similar conditions you’re able adjust population. Sadly, all-too-typical American story. Guy even Union Steward 😣 People want make big changes called radicals. REALLY behind, making giant leaps forwards. behind, half measures actually radical activity. earth letting Americans in? wondering since coworkers neighbor heading Alaska probably 30 drive here. get turned around border saying can’t enter 22 kids shot dead care **that** either, so... surprise. really work way. like magically enemies would kill Americans. all, higher population would made less casualties.

Um ... population gone worldwide. would ""magically enemies"", get born way Americans get born. Must super spreaders there. Great, Treasury would actually release funds approved USPS months ago part relief act get along days. raw numbers far? 25% death toll.

In per capita numbers? 7.2% death toll

In terms timeline? way ahead 1st wave spanish flu did. second wave factors made spanish flu bad (mutation + war), could easily get us close spanish flu numbers America. reason can't roll drive testing motorcycle? looking US Canada Toronto Metro like 10th. GTA Metro population 5.9M little less #9 Atlanta 6.0M still weddings going Notre Dame university. brother going one. trying stop friend cancel. ""It booked 3 years advance."" 

Yeah I'm pissed scared happen think deserve point. Unless plan introducing something water supply see campus-wide party ban going happen... shit takes like got us mess first place. Difference is, ward killed 200k young men COVID gives cancer/heart disease/liver damage/CFS/clotting issues/brain damage? Seems like least those. Heard immunity 70%. means majority population could permanently disabled. really want take risk real front faces much smaller risk long term issues vaccine? Even vaccine gives issues 10 years line that’s 10 years don’t deal issues COVID also get go back somewhat normalized existence. There’s sense taking large known risk small unknown risk. I’ll take chances proven vaccine day.  Thanks, extremely helpful. Remember told us get touching surfaces, started wearing gloves, told us REALLY get air 6ft apart, said ok actually 12-18ft brushed rug opened country back up? You’re right don’t trust administration trust multiple agencies (both scientific regulatory) producing oxford vaccine even moderna one. agencies aren’t American either. want go concerts bars meet new people? Yes.

No, don’t want kill grandma.

Yes, understand young people die suffer drastic damage.

No, won’t go anyway anti-mask/bad/science.

Just let people acknowledge massive toll shaming people wanting socialize isn’t actual strategy. pulled something together last minute, learn zoom stuff. great. took class year done learn online classes effectively efficiently. professors did. takes things seriously. 
She genetic blood clotting disorder, can’t take certain medication (I can’t remember is). brother actually got coronavirus super spreading event Idaho ski resort back March? survived thinks it’s taking meds, can’t. 
He sick still issues. people rebel science common sense.

Caused, least part, several generations evangelicals teaching kids science something ignored. First evolution/intelligent design debate.  morphed science denial climate change manifesting pandemic. less year war lasted five years. Second this: pedo thing seems **total** non-sequiter.  WUWT? Trump, always been. care. “They” don’t. done proper planning.

Not without doubling number schools teachers next month, not. wife teaches school built 700 kids there's 1100 there. Closets converted offices. teachers even classrooms. already working 50-60 hour weeks. We're paying classroom supplies pockets. unique - many schools around us situation. say ""planning"" issue height ignorance, stupidity, willful blindness. resource issue. 

Education fucked decades matter people. Salaries cut, buildings left rot (my High School condemned building - tore two years graduated), calls alarm ignored. get come tell yet even less. nice robust, resilient education system don't. life support *before* hit. proposing insulting back normal country

This new normal. Get used it. know deeply want ignore let others die think anymore, surprisingly other's willing die inconvenienced. RIP homies. 

I hope grow this. know hoax dems We'll find wife cabinet get sick like Brazil Right wing, religious retarded way go life. Wonder many ww2 veterans died covid first people get need most, First Responders Frontline HealthCare workers etc. lots time see opportunity get it. ""and a favorite members “Jersey Shore” cast,""


That's enough stay away.  come numbers though. surprised disappointed sheer number parents whined pushed *for* clothing rules sons ""can't concentrate"".

I disagree stance reality school administrations always going take path least resistance. one level, blame then. wants deal Karens? hand, whiniest groups antimask... students', families, lives line. think bit important hormone addled kid getting erection. US also 3x population then, looking 1.5-3M deaths equal death rate back then. I'm fairly confident hit that. believe first day 1,000 without benefit backlog Americans always valued Individualism collectivism. movement towards latter people start fear communism (too much government control lives)

Everyone looks anyone else. Europe different people “neighborly” thus better equipped mentally wise handle pandemic. think anyone's life ""drop bucket."" consider 10 deaths vs. 1000 10,000 deaths success bizarre me. tell families family member going make trust heartbreaking. think causalities success vs. failure...I just...don't understand it. Every life lost tragedy. died would normally died tragic way. Depends. want people believe earth flat, yes need prove so. Likewise, want others like believe vaccine dangerous, need prove us. listen reason probably 58% Americans. given track record America current leadership, see happening right away. stop this. rioters masked hide identities, protests, especially back first kicked off, nearly mask free. Back government still pretending masks work. They'll say something else contracted instead covid. Yet support people like Roy Moore.

Make make sense. king said, behold fields fucks barren fuck left give  Good news raining season over. chance another flooding year WUHAN exceedingly small. true. expect people come vacation. feel you, april 2020 feels like distant memory.

It feels like pandemic years. don’t protect children pedos (uh, since when?) shouldn’t protect COVID?

Seriously, I’ve stopped trying make sense stuff. It’s worth it. lEtS bRiNg kIdS bAcK sChOoL tOtaLlY sAfE good idea, #1 testing. Test students, staff, support staff, first day. site testing equipment. Quick turn around test results. Immediate quarantine suspected positives. Keeping isolation untested til proven negative. guessing might suggesting here. Lol, drive bus, gave box clorox wipes, said look sick send em home. mean bad, losing people 70+, different losing people 18-30. better comparison would years lost, 80 year old loses 2, 18 year old loses 64, death 31 times worse. Usa #1? Fortunately movement bigly tiny. health hazard none less. never able find out. Often overlooked history U.S. aided Soviets War Lend Lease Agreement. 14 thousand aircraft, 12 thousand tanks, 40 thousand Jeeps, 376 thousand cargo trucks, 4.8 million tons food, 15 million pairs boots, 1.5 million blankets, 250 thousand radios, almost 1 Billion rounds ammunition. No. read sources. I’m arguing China propaganda encouraging policy changes.

the op troll meant also almost 3x population too, raw number higher percent population lower. Probably lot. ask? Hard, yes, however impossible minimize risks.  yes, everywhere. Get groceries delivered, gas without touching handle keypad skin, wear mask outside, avoid unnecessary trips store anywhere may find idiots. saw idiot wild yesterday (rare live), dicknose (nose mask) gave 12' distance stayed upwind times. Yes, going hard, survival traditionally difficult. finished one actually. 

Wore mask
Had hand sanitizer right cup holder, used every bathroom gas stop.
If place looked crowded kept driving.
My destinations desert parks. Make mandatory exceptions except legitimate medical exemptions doctor. Round people up, force-inject them, release. pandemic time idiots. Burnouts downvote speaking magic plant Except numbers BS, hospitals counting patients multiple times, claiming covid patients died something else, accepting false positive tests, list goes on. Ur idiot u think numbers correct. 9 infected people walking halls nobody wearing masks, 100 others haven’t diagnosed yet. people seeing stupidity time seeing friends family post social media acting like naive, ignorant, fools care people.

If there's one thing quarantine given time think reflect ourselves. test, can't come positive. ::Taps head:: Scientists fail - POLITICIANS did, like US. Nooo way can't believe it, Florida places?! never happened. never tour again? could last chance. strip clubs open anywhere right now? casinos. Add effects CTE outplaying Russian roulette health heads. thanks Meaning low risk (or I’m assuming are) still spread high risk individuals. isn’t feasible high risk people lock forever. us getting vaccinated better chance us another 300,000 dead next year even wasn’t us. I’d parents even people don’t know compassion. That’s mom giving child swab using home test. They’re 1:40 embedded video version. Even 1% death toll crush number around 2.5% 2 people come visit me, also self quarantine. dont got anywhere leave home hang eachother every while. dont contact anyone else unless go store. Even 2 people see feel bit irresponsible! see another person goin beach, dinner, movie etc etc etc. could better damn people. Stop going rivers beaches! Fake news  Fauci already said skeptical first generation vaccine

This isn’t vaccines done. need tested, studies adjusted 

We throwing everything got anything sticks rushing mass production 

Don’t surprised need vaccinated 2 3 times It’s really what’s right smart. things wouldn’t gotten far. Yeah shit. first one got may? fuck expect $2,400 support Americans past 5 months Americans barely savings (if any) wish sadly not.  know many freedoms would cost? may woooshed guys realize REALLY FUCKING OBVIOUS SARCASM RIGHT? RIGHT?! Portland awesome, went hiking lahar Mt St Helens almost ran gas stumbled across park ranger looking poachers radioed gas station stay open us. genuinely nice place single stranger wander around. I’m Canadian, high bar ‘nice’. wants pretend he’s something without really anything, since knows poll numbers terrible due idiotic pandemic response. Last week:

Spain: ~55 deaths

UK: ~370 deaths

Italy: ~60 deaths

Germany: ~35 deaths

France: ~50 deaths

USA: ~7000 deaths

you math... Why? recently Barcelona. blast there. ""It is."" fuck? Thats true actually. Even florida im seeing masks heh yeah sad say there's gonna ton evictions rent/housing needs go way zero background public health medicine, rather business economics. 

From gather mobility studies, NZ Australia absolutely cannot continue way years unless want live economic depression.

To return mobility would return GDP anything close previous levels would result infections, regardless mask usage. bad

I'm trained automatically reinterpret headlines, better worse. Idk Minnesotas pretty good heard Republican relative there, told AZ going problem Democrats hoax virus. big city thing. lives outside Phoenix. fears justified.

I mean, day US state department lifted global travel restrictions.

 

What mean Americans?

It means government saying, A-OK go travel since countries relatively safe now!

Yes, read right:

**Take infected asses go vacation overseas beaten COVID-19, spread shit back them.** sound like idiot tbh. can't hide fucking pandemic. Useless, good portion stolen identity fraud probably still sent already deceased individuals. anything *stimulate economy.* go urgent care today waited waiting room 10 people. Supposedly there's 36% chance county one infected.

I hope one two wearing masks. surprised disappointed front desk lady give make put on.  Don’t come SoCal. I’ve always hated living loved Bay it’s totally different world. Granted it’s progressive there... feel always never ending loop 1/4 maybe 1/2 state I’d following rules. went completely downhill Gavin jumped gun started reopening everything. constantly hearing death rates going signals people really whatever.  Prediction: rapid antibody tests become widely available election. find 90% population already asymptomatic.

Business continue usual. Life go on. Fear mongers doomers feel like idiots. Sucks man. dream vacation planned September we’ve saving years, would first trip country. don’t even know realistically aim for. test people rain wet yes dry due use umbrellas. reference message every time hear someone use ""But choice!"" argument. People worried USPS &amp; voting: Check drop ballot person. YMMV, I've able drop absentee ballot county offices every place voted.


Feel like I'll copy-pasting comment lot coming weeks :-/ would necessarily rush young healthy taking vaccine. Might stupidest take time one slap face would vaccine coronavirus never made before

For *human* coronavirus. veterinary vaccines coronaviruses. Wow money people’s lives smh 1 2000 americans died (more like 1 1600 go excess deaths). However amount required hospitalization quite bit higher (to tune 5x). wonder much needed people start taking seriously. NYC time high murders tho... probably least control city America already months countries used think minority believe anymore. Even everyone know know n real life describe, people know online actually share beliefs facts science proper research. real life conspiracy theories everywhere. dont want know many times family continues say masks harmful dont anything still compare flu like long symptoms everyone safe forth. Agreed, seeing kind news. That's going challenge think going even harder vaccinate enough population even matter, even crazy credible evidence indicating vaccines safe. I'm implying we'll said evidence, best case scenario gonna uphill battle get folks lining jab. vaccine yet... also claiming 100% effective? deflecting again, - get paid it? I've read people may asymptomatic cell memory fighting coronaviruses like common cold. infecting everyone cold virus substantiated? Everyone person infected case new viral disease know little about, also experimenting getting it! 

If think dodge COVID forever, good luck, without herd immunity virus going touring planet irregularly. understand risks, I'm making conscious decision mask hand sanitizer safe enough. 

Not everyone's risk equal, someone underlying health conditions person stay home? Citation needed get point part mostly villages seeing anyone besides family little extreme. midwest like rest country outside cities. cities midwest too. Children immune! means little Bobby go school fine without mask! It’s nice they’re opening schools ;D

But since doesn’t wear mask, shouldn’t either go store outside!!!!!!! I’m gonna tell whole world follow genius footsteps!

/s goddamn cynical, disgusting, plain stupid. pandemic. we're together whether like not. can't hide it. nihilism fucking lame. one ""brain washed liberal college""?  way totally eliminate virus whole world goes lock 14 days together. Military take 14 days ration food anyone fail follow rule arrested sight put lowest priority come covid treatment. 

People selfish entrusted right thing. Stick required comply. leadership certainly care. believe tests accurate 5-9 days exposure. Probably first 2 days test negative even process catching course care.....about ourselves. well least MBL players got union, covered It’s pretty ridiculous. Every state fair share dumbasses. know Californians love shitting Midwest, even Central Valley. heard people say valley “basically Midwest/flyover country/insert state think boring uneducated”. Like no, it’s not, it’s still California, it’s side people refuse even acknowledge state LA SF. goes states. Washington Oregon filled neo-nazis methheads, New York isn’t New York City, on. 

I swear people would shocked realize Midwest cities. Normalization. That's really is. testing do.

Some people say test much. Read manuals, read books! ""We're New York!"" heard phrase much locally shut March...now, crickets.

On plus side, masks work. county numbers showing significant decline two weeks mandatory mask orders. approaching 40-50's per day, 6 less past days. think Greek houses open summer that's feeling driving area, hard data models already predicting 300k December don’t ignore herd immunity still get million. Four days exposure optimal. Actually starts two weeks now. guess give people time buy one. bike work. virus early got numbers 10 per day. Yesterday 40. Still quite low compared u.s. state. getting little complacent since summer live beautiful British Columbia read names...""Jamal"" *tosses* ""Frank"" *keeps...etc*

Same ever Interesting. shows clear downtrend currently. NY highest deaths per million world....I wouldn’t use guide. ""Americans smart enough recognize entire society favor personal health - would care themselves?""

This. 1. Donald Trump

3. Donald Trump

4. Donald Trump Exactly. COULD done safely. crazy part. I'd note country, Finland, part NATO, conscription army largest number total military personnel per capita, North Korea. unallied military wise, expect support countries war Russia (who fought WWII without US support, yea, thanks that). entire military defense policy based Russia attacks, alone without help.

Yet, cheaper better health care system US.

Secondly, US second expensive health care system world (depending year). health care cost per capita European countries less half US: words, US could already afford system European countries have. excuse US cannot afford ""protects Russia"". US paying health care already, US affords much European countries, still health care system US worse. Wait really? told you’re fine go work? dunno, definitely older conservative crowd whining masks live. flu killed Americans every single war combined. meaningless. I'll get vaccinated, front line. Right. completely manageable. But, (US) can't it. GOP terrorist organization. Please keep saying loud. 100% true. They've testing apart freedoms since Nixon. time abolish republicans forever. Stupid cunt. Half countries world histories revolution, US hardly unique generations removed others. Yeah mean, American I'm mad. I'd want us lock country infected ours. know read chart... I'm even sure arguing about... fewer dead people right less lethal originally thought. already 100k+, calling someone saying 60k predicted bad how?  Death denial go vroom...

Sarcasm ignorance? kills it'd one thing X% population sort dithering, really board necessarily exacerbating situation badly either, perhaps waiting information, perhaps sort half-assing it. That'd still set back, perhaps manageable. 

But no, assholes actively enthusiastically *against* collective actions might give us fighting chance ending thing. Literally possible solution involves bit 'hard' work 'spirit blitz' common cause ignored, rejected pushed back against. 'solutions' hear magic silver bullet cures (which, comes vaccines, they'll also almost certainly group likely reject taking 'forced') 'it is' fatalism tells nothing done all. hyperbolic say 'pro-virus', yet, actions demeanor effectively indistinguishable conclusion. US spends second education per student world, $12,800. can't educate people want educated, thus throwing money problem pay idiots try solve futile. response prime example this. quite bit countries europe higher death rates. maybe raising awareness right thing everything planned conspiracy.

Context perspective matter. ask me, republican. Wait there's people pay people cut nails? low opinion humanity somehow takes new level. whether die simply make rapid recovery, either way, we’re supposed say “see, really bad?” makes sense. Why? get safe vaccine ineffective place mean vaccination rates high large percentage refuse vaccine? mean, US gaining Europe hit earlier right it?

Going capita, last time Belgium 300 deaths(10 actual deaths x 30 population) 29th July. Plenty days 60-150 even 0.

Regardless population, density, US follow strict fucking protocol, would jump, would actually trending right direction. Neither letting people die sociopath feel normalcy. dont know virus high survival rate, test way nation, case numbers highly inflated cause death questionable, USA 330 million people.

However, doesn’t get complicated people sheltering exposing less risk accidental deaths? Well, can't argue fact.

Although white birth rate decline, government's hatreds towards brown immigrants, population decline matter time. Still, military budget help that. What's backwards really worried reopening economy, we'd investing heavily testing rapid result testing.

""As April 14, 2020, CDC case counts death counts include confirmed **probable** cases might also want read release US CDC bases counts also direct fact EVERY symptom list symptom many diseases. even using bare minimum two (used three) matches, still could another disease.

Generally, parallels absence universal health coverage US presence Europe. root it, believe, lies significant part situation wars. coded European DNA (metaphorically speaking) face death great hardship, rich poor; may huddle bomb shelters together, country may literally overrun, matter rich are. Obviously, classes Europe, truth cut tissue European consciousness like knife left scar day, good scar.

The wounds war different wounds disease, however. Spanish flu wound way Great War, scars speak. Spanish flu movies. Pandemics come party dressed like everyone else: illness already beset threatened by, losing lost loved ones to. Wars involve intentional actors kind swift, maiming, terrifying violence registers, reasons biological, cognitive existential, special way. end result European culture better, sober sense mortality vulnerabilities welfare outside setting intentional combat.

Or that's theory. Clearly, minimum, entails sense ""bleeding through"" wherein wounds war bled wounds disease way elevate disease level universal concern commitment combat. happen Europe (by theory) US? Obviously, difference attack one's shores country borders. American song Great War was, all, *Over There*, *Over Here*, whereas European experience ""right here, right now"". intentional attack translate ""attack disease ill health"" Europeans, Americans ""in *the* hospital"" Europeans ""in hospital"", like one's ""in church"" even ""in bed""?

I think European ""bleed through"" (from war ill-health universal threat) matter mentioned conditions working together. enough US support full transformation universal. Absent war shores shocking consciences awakening, hope US regard internal movement compelling stature. Bernie Sanders' idea ""political revolution"" one possibility. others, slightest idea either could even means serious real movement takes forms yet unknown. sense movement assume one ""does one does"": marches street, say, commits revolutionary acts change voting box; or, undertakes bloody revolution old style (no one really wants save nut jobs, thankfully.)

No, honestly know prevalent left right, make specific claim.

But that's irrelevant point anyway. point type attitude common left, problem. american hate Word socialism? people know, democratic socialism good thing, want improve Individual living situation? understand looked people. really think free healthcare anything communism? Considering China facing food shortage due floods relying grain, corn, soybean imports US interesting situation.

I'm wondering risk exposure grain corn sterilization process is, lot crops grown Midwest. Someone colleges subreddit already posted Snapchat video party 15 people. People recognized kids said lot nursing students. school plans bringing us back we’re screwed. remember video, true gem. There's something majestic cop cars chasing mean operate US army hardware...helicopters tanks etc. would consider military? 

Fair points. skipping, consider authorizing use finish trials, monitoring public adverse effects.

It also good tool use vaccines. 

What mean safety vaccine isn’t thing question. important safety people. know wait trials completed, alternative people sure dying C-19. need balance unknown potential dangers vaccine danger know there. emergency use authorization for. good thing use sometimes. Even vaccines. shouldn’t pretend like issue emergency use authorization, safe every vaccine there, almost certainly safer alternative vaccinated. important make sure people fully informed process works. equally blame, no.  lazy. Ya, even wearing one outdoors poses way lower risk, especially around anyone. like oh yeah heard seems pretty big care I'm pissed ready war. calling republicanism mental disease now? Please! way happen lifetime US. anybody cares getting back business usual. pandemic scare finally get back pre-2020 routine, nobody see need want make effort change it. situation would unlikely happen lifetime.

If happen pandemic over, happening all. fuck gave award caught ""Friend"" Sharing facebook post basically said kidnappings rise easily hide kids behind masks. literally checked website that's just... incorrect? Balkans near USA levels new cases. Everywhere else lower. past fifty days USA around three million new cases, Europe whole one million. Europe double population USA well rate roughly six seven times lower...

Stop spreading misinformation.

Using 850k new cases last 14 days america, get 257 new cases per 100k. Europe 270k new cases timeframe, giving 36 new cases per 100k. Italy one point hit 11.3%. 

If people can’t get admitted hospital, .5% longer valid. 

Or even go hospital. Stop fear tactics. money they’ll sign Medicaid spot treat fine. Kindly fuck please.

Sincerely, Canada ""Them"" Americans? What's proposed alternative? Please whitewash hard, bush Reagan monsters Uh oh RHINO-22 sounds scary af  Lack leadership WTF? He's dictator-like ling time. WTF wrong YOU? can't point stuff? people thinks wearing mask taking away freedom. AKA dumbass Americans. love motorcycling worry hysteria reporting like may cause. absolutely feel like public might blame bikers becomes ""super spreader event"" predicting group already suffer prejudices cultivated us police. last thing need run road someone believes ""the right thing"". attending Sturgis. wear mask wash hands. support Twitler. motorcyclists idiots. Please blame us idiocy (maybe insubstantial) few. want die pogrom. Edit: yeah see mean, based people it, would obviously tested positive, otherwise would know it? explanation pretty self explanatory. People = people testing positive. Except that's situation they're talking about, what's called Howard Koh, professor Harvard T. H. Chan School Public Health former Department Health Human Services Assistant Secretary Obama administration, said testing shortage created pattern unequal privileged parts country getting daily access others access all,” Koh said. “We’re never going solve pandemic give everybody access, particularly high-risk groups. That’s public health principle always try Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said testing delays are ""totally unacceptable"" need fixed.


In lot cases high-risk getting prioritized, well-off. regardless, massive delays testing unacceptable defeats entire point testing. won’t even see comparison know existence. people need learn surround propaganda American “exceptionalism” feel good narratives they’re good guys everyone disagrees boogeymen get them. Exactly needed no-expense-spared PSA campaign celebrities ends spectrum stops between, 30-second spots simple one sizzling skillet, egg cracked it, egg sizzling six words (spoken): “This brain drugs”

[Disclaimer use foot, set. dropped ball hard can't comprehend can't go back 'old normal'. fascinatingly sad many levels. We're going 2021 looking back saying: ""so many stupid people, many sick life dead now."" Google Q pedophiles bad people used say, ""annual flu deaths still higher."" matter major world even deaths, coronavirus killing people died otherwise. Stop trying downplay seriousness virus Hey flush feet. making things worse disabled people can't things like that. agree. summed concise manor. sounds better imply nurse couldn’t look leg busy caring corona patients. won’t work people public aren’t coughing. Funny. Theres post /r/all right guy want kids gf pregnant.

Almost every comment telling man take responsibility actions.

I'm guessing tell thing? don’t understand cases children people thought “immune” opposed LEAST EXPOSED GROUP  Considering people obnoxiously rev stupid engines 3 weeknights disturb whole neighborhoods, I’m surprised. American one thing learned country conservatives literally get money TV networks, even networks owned wealthy families prefer tax cuts go easy them. blame actually trying hard none resources voice comparison.

e.g. Fox News watched news program America, larger next combined, dominance sell fantasy they're weak underdogs. Real underdogs never even get voice world, blamed, top get perpetuate whatever fantasy want. close friend wide. took real fast also take drink water. even explained said people want take one anecdote context go ahead keep thinking mask deniers die, maybe they’ll finally get it.

But don’t. 2 million die malaria every year. See? Covid big deal people. Back work. someone realizes Philippines part United States World War 2 Philippine death American Citizen (they literally American Flag uniform). I've really hunt good news potential treatments worked right now.

If anyone creditable information therapeutics working well please share others may want good news!


Thank Look charts...there time deaths dropped 500 per day, daily cases much less hospitalizations significantly well. due lockdown schools closed. effective reason many states deemed time reopen, averaging 1000 deaths day 2 weeks so. numbers go schools reopened many places now, may take weeks us see change.

The spike 2k deaths result NY shutting things widespread...it really bad time shut things down, deaths showed weeks later. It’s impossible talk sense MAGA cult. April. one we’ve found treatments help patients didn’t try start. Chances longer goes on, likely get vaccine find alternative treatments. think would greatly help reduce deaths. I'm saying necessary, I'm saying get hoity toity people choosing wear masks. Presumably mean “I take safe, approved vaccination,” “I break research labs prior clinical trials, steal batches vaccines, inject them” Ken colleagues working finding ways boost immune system may help people future pandemics. think make immune systems stronger, we'll better able fight coronavirus, well viral bacterial pathogens may unleashed future.""

it CANNOT hurt give everyone MMR booster.

“Who cares, people die wagon accidents every day village” entire thread retarded jacked up. Apparently tested negative, yet symptoms, currently suffering Pneumonia, never before. local urgent care, hospital interested testing stuff, get larger bill. Im sorry, medexpress? effing business suddenly decide day take covid test, drag inside, take blood, xray lung cancer. Sure found pneumonia, explains alot, wtf.

But covid test came back negitive, now, barely able breath, function, think straight, dont get started fact seeing things corner eye due lack air, go back work able pay bills.

Im prolly going loose job barely function. broke sweats getting bed, fever, im free that, fatigue. Im super scared right now, antibiotics dont seem helping. good safe whole quarentine, credit card companies me, need feed family got back work laid up. even know do.  

My lungs fire take breath, yet ""fine"" according blood work stuff. Im sorry hid xrays doctor people saw lungs. saw clouds fog them. hey, test cancer, thanks 500 dollar bill cant afford. Good you’re brainwashed stupid lmao. Hopefully give life general, stop wasting oxygen could using ourselves. Thanks good riddance! no, wtf talking about?! death toll projected millions completely shut everything. Stop spreading lies! Sure, require symptoms order test we’re missing swaths cases. Still surprised surpass number. size virus largely irrelevant. carried primarily droplets fluid expelled respiratory system means mask simply needs fine enough stop droplets effective. Crazy people exists every country.  Preach! Newt ever living shit bag congress besides Strom Thurman Mitch....Jesus....what happened? men heroes. Sometimes sit wonder virus actually seasonal worse yet come Ahhhhhh, well...back day, would called 'freedom masks' boom...problem solved.

Stop disingenuous. Stupid sexy Flanders! lie text.

This arguement. trying spread misinformation throwing fit called out. Ah yes, ""I know am"" defense. could see reading literally.

Only someone 5 brain cells can't understand context. 

The guys comment easy understand obviously meant American wars. Anyone taking something else either stupid, intentionally misunderstanding dicks.  asked I've told can't dictate kind face covering wear. Meme version that: Conservatives man. Conservatives. wish parenst grandparents dead mean people feel same. ""We can't enforce people wear masks."" Says society enforces people wear pants. even talk Corina virus? Gees liberal media clinging straws make clicks virus die down, vaccine multiple ones develop. Travel restrictions lifted, things go back semblance normal. Use warning US place live raise family. fooled complacency Trump loses election. There's large portion population willfully ignorant going anywhere. listen reason science logic, listen ""their sources"". see way this. administration trustworthy things. sorts reasons distrust them.

There plenty reasons this, EAU hydroxychloriquine taht later rescind, shady stuff posted CDC website death rates, early lies masks, fact president lies time constantly puts undue pressure top officials even calls names constantly public defy him, switching stuff away FDA like doing, etc. stuff happen normal administration, truly scary comes trusting administration's health advice.

So since entire argument comes ""I trust officials"". Well normally do. right now, that's darn sure. not. Stop saying fear-mongering ass shit. getting upvotes?! That’s ridiculous. 90 year old heart disease vs. healthy person prime lives? Covid takes, what, week life 90 year old? Versus WW2 taking 70 years deceased. spaghetti straps! PROMIT SEX! Terrorists wish dangerous nations anti-intellectuals liars are. don’t want eat inside restaurant, going able go concert? Italy inconsequential WW2, losing fights 10-1 man advantages vs British, terrible tanks aircraft often using WW1 era equipment (1 4 Italian soldiers proper weapons rations). hasn’t yet. goal projected death count warn people happen continue act way do, predict absolute future. 

I think rate going, hit 300,000 December. totally believable that, barring miracle, hit number I'm American, I'm scared resentful, like you, maybe becume one reason virus statistically killing older people young, would help healthcare system long run reducing high cost patients(older) short term? Mostly people exhibiting symptoms, opened testing anyone feels like need it, restricted symptomatic individuals. title made laugh hard Exactly, man around long time. wanted would have. Especially bad time get politics given next administrations likely going difficult thankless set tasks So, contagious infected people got inside body first place? one put there? Injections, food, water? Yep. Who's say vaccine give cancer 10 years road? Phase 3 trials can't catch that. “And therein lies conundrum: it’s safe see it, it’s probably effective. it’s deactivating virus bacteria it’s harmful humans,” says Lilien. request really came true! /s Im sure be, last time saw months behind pleasantly surprised see much recent version! Somehow heard one yet admit, got chuckle it. would skip handwashing? Hand-Sanitizer 100% hand sanitizer least 75% alcohol is.

I'm going criticize accuracy comment. I'll say comment misleading important facts known, I'll leave facts want sure they're taking best precautions can:

1. people idea use hand sanitizer. apply way *should* wash hands: rub 20 seconds, ensure hit every area hands; palms fingers. slap go, effective going give false sense security safety.
2. people idea [properly wash either, compounds problem hand sanitizer.
3. Soap usually actually sanitizes hand. Friction does. supposed wash hands least 20 seconds. Instead, soap vehicle germs: scrub hands soap, killing germs, rinse soap off, allows slide hands scrubbed. Antimicrobial properties soap makes difference. (And, fact, soap property discouraged due potential allowing antimicrobial-resistant bugs evolve.) friction washing hands matters most, miss spot, placing risk. exceptions this? Sure. [clinical even then, hands visibly soiled. everyday life, non-clinical hand sanitizers, [not skip handwashing. Washing hands effective method sanitizing hands outside clinical environment, according CDC. take word it; take theirs. Guys can’t wear tank tops either lmao pedos this? Ugh.
Thank trying spread sense anyway. lower. Disgusting risk reward. boogie man virus stopped vaccine. media needs virus split demographics power axises control. viral infection, propaganda - literally flu 99.7% people. think registered yet people option waiting week month get vaccinated: one going offer soon.

 median person US probably wait several months dose vaccine (not necessarily one tested one like best) available them.

During time, FOMO going push lot people ""let people go first, I'll wait"" ""I want mine now"". point, quite possibly offered 1st approved vaccine, already given 100+ million people several months. given choice getting newer, less tested vaccine immediately keep waiting 1st approved vaccine. Stupid people exist everywhere guess. large number infected, new case mutated anyone infected previously extremely susceptible new deadly strain? Oops forgot put /s that. Also didn’t make personal choice. bone cancer. Gern geschehen! Thank criticism, helpful. see point. 

I've emailed author article see clarify many positives came Barren River health department. problem instance enforcement. big push get polio vaccine 50s, manufacturing mistake live virus instead dead virus used hundred thousands doses.

Tens thousands kids got sick. couple hundred degree paralysis, ten died. Yea partially means different things different people body chemistry different, hope one size fits dose sedation give enough keep comfy since won’t able tell isn’t. beyond sad. going kill thousands! Welcome club. sad sit watch country fall apart; especially feel powerless stop it. heinous shit would happen thing reported “What listening to?” school wearing heavy metal band shirt meant satan worshiper malfeasant. I’m wondering mean 9 people started school covid positive? thought 14 day incubation period...? seems early 9 cases caught school. 14 day incubation period debunked..? clothing? student's KKK lunchboxes bumper stickers cars say ""Repeal 13th Amendment Now!""? Don’t try sativa first you’re anxious person. aren’t supposed wash produce soap Okay, first.... take deep breath.

Second, remember sub something disaster fetishism. That's casting judgment it, there's horrible beautiful time science situation. headlines make feel better, look math.

You already experienced first part. people, especially young healthy, minor illness. fever, felt crappy days, feel better. ""long term health effects"" nearly rare dying disease, prevalent people serious illness required hospitalization. 

That you. Look - FEEL better? probably better! Isolate give body chance eradicate remaining virus spread it, go life safe knowledge immune pandemic (before people start ""three month antibody"" stuff, there's immunity cases re-infection rare statistically insignificant). want everybody agree one response immunity 

No, that's complete lie made up. ton reasons, laid article. Let guess, pay increase? working? would good know we’re going need save pay taxes next year. even sure legally this? Well... least never hear kind thing Mainland China. Sources? don’t think are.  gotten flu shot since little ended sick hospitalized. Wondering maybe risk year. I'm glad someone stepping plate. Latin America getting devastated Covid. Financial aid access vaccine save lot lives.  Imagine horrible person you’d bully minimum wage workers threats lawsuits don’t want inconvenience wearing mask 10 minutes store. Wow wonder want everybody agree one response *immunity* , see variables, like overpopulation, cannot immunity possibly created virus. one coherent. End discussion.  country populists act overtly anti-science made fools themselves. profit crisis. diving shark infested waters, choice wouldn’t support accept. problem insisting dragging don’t want shark food waters them. *Only* hospitalizations. Let’s try stay honest. don’t know you, 11-13yr old family members running around neighborhood playing kids neighborhood since early June. don’t think every, even kids sitting house since March given many people stopped giving fuck virus months ago. No, teaching actual history, propaganda version. Kids told bad guys worked stolen land stolen people. Ignoring nothing [In ""moral duty"" keep healthy. yes, that's people history. successful. US cares much kids alone age. kids would fine, give games snacks, microwavable food. higher?!?! People dumb! That's six years away COVID time. much experiments waffling like panicked chicken I’m going adapt “new normal” bullshit, sorry dude. I’m already seeing friends family, ensure I’m going lot active social soon vaccine comes grandfather's assisted living facility Georgia started allowing visitors month ago. rule two people, outside only, 30 minutes day, everyone wearing masks sitting opposite ends 6 foot table. hugs. least something. thought covid testing free??  Welcome ~~Vault~~ District 123. Masks optional strongly encouraged. Remember, speaking media consequences! even talk fucking her... objectifying much? Plus, we’re talking that, looks smoking hot. Weird flex  kids school influenza season? Influenza far #1 cause death children hospitalization rates 2.4 1000. option safely re-open schools anyone, children not. trade losing year two formative education (in case young children), vs. risking death community, pretty clear correct choice is.

additionally, plenty things parents/other adults teach young kids purely academically based. homeschooling bit dicey depending who's administering, i'd argue results probably different general schooling people get. public education system america pretty shit actually learning things. None friends health care workers. know health care workers.

I would prefer health care workers idle day, ever needed services emergency there.

I understand it. nurse busy attend leg pain, probably busy properly care go hospital. obviously taking time deal unlikely return 100%.

Even greedy, selfish bastard want - pure non-altruistic selfishness hospitals overwhelmed. get it. obvious...the virus spread photograph publication. Wow😂😂😂 Ireland getting hit seriously question merits article. I'm afraid people supposed learn something learn this. *shocked Pikachu face* I'm sure feel honest. Sure, agree intentions likely good I'm sure he's gotten results past. hand, he's essentially fear montering, whether he's aware not. I've heard enough stories lately elderly cancelling most, all, home care fear, imagine pretty deleterious effects. stories relatives fighting keep family members elderly homes, get seriously ill hurt due getting level care needed. like fear short supply lately I'm sure get behind adding top that, matter intention. point virus animal reservoir almost impossible eradicate. Coronaviruses found bats,cats, dogs, mink, etc. 

That mean can't get control. Neither posts thread even coherent responses replying to. Perhaps responding wrong ppsts/thread? Why? One parent stay home work babysit day.

My wife informed apparently called babysitting children. see something like coming /s Well, well, well - consequences actions. IMHO, leave states.. go another country, since American, could get good job gulf country(where from) Asian country. wanted study states MBA, seeing what’s going there, would never since government can’t even advice people properly enforce things done long ago.  Isnt trumps sons school online atm? forget name. lot private schools seem happy go online I've said since beginning line beat trump probably 2 million dead. Less I'd bet he'll win.

Tell me, number 20,000 60,000 *more* number 405,399? Thanks! I’ve also saw Twitter high school closed Monday Tuesday. believe even 'show cases'.

Now, businesses state licensed, terms liquor campgrounds, governor absolutely could stopped them. not, posted condescending video trusted ""her people"" Sturgis overwhelmingly favored cancelling this. makes sense consider people average South Dakotans, people give cronies money.

Those urns prove anything. economy stopped weeks, course reopen backorders going come compensate demand funerals/cremations placed hold.

the two sources piggybacking first ""source"", usual.

If China stop sure /r/China would talking it, even anti-CCP subreddit believing numbers they're actually see evidence working.

So it? 

When majority, *should* ""made people's lives hell"" ""wants/needs majority"" ignored 
-or- 
We ""ignore(d) wants/needs majority"" avoid ""ma(king) people's lives hell""

You arguing sides. say that's reason, one big reasons.

1. Lack universal healthcare meant lot people want go hospital get tested early on.

2. Lack paid sick leave meant lot people went work sick.

3. Poverty austerity (50% nation can't afford $400 emergency expense) meant lot people work matter what. 

4. Lack social safety net meant states couldnt really shutdown. cant pay unemployment claims. 

5. states (Florida) income tax tourism (why think Disney World opened, Disneyland not?)

6. General anti-science anti-intellectual culture party spread Republican Party win. 

7. confusing state federal system designed handle situations like central planning, especially without competent government. 

8. Excessive focus corporate interest meant politicians cant shut make corporate overlords mad. appease $6T bailout. 

9. corporate media immense influence nation, exasperated issue ""both siding"" coronavirus debate (airing bunch ""it's flu"" folks ""it serious"" folks).

Exactly. Half deaths people nursing homes. 95% 65 least one preexisting condition. average age dead 78. Seventy-fucking-eight.

Yeah. would stay away Chinese vaccine way U.S China relations right lol. right, really early make real assertions lasting effects. I've probably done damage self partying. I’m confused...I thought US first world country still struggling virus? Don’t forget active shooter drills prepare for. 700,000 tests today. New record. didnt dodge point though. strong temptation break rules, ie spend entire years vaction quarantine, rules arent enforced rules may well exist.

Even better, rules changed easier enforce. easier stop people entering policing travel enter. anyone expecting??

Such shit show. ☺️ failed remarkably. Look need look paper say stupid things like that... say ""lockdown"" mean things lockdown mentioned... believe it. want discuss 6 months more. another year more. I'm also skeptical wheter use noses mouths breathing, think science inconclusive point. Also, wearing masks public places dangerous super hard. impossible thing do, like I'm gonna die it. thing choice. one nearly every modernized country managed, US simply won't. know people need healthcare, mostly people screaming go work healthcare one's scream ""SOCIALISM"" moment someone suggests uncoupling healthcare employment. worse, vote people ardently opposed idea share hatred something. 

Coronavirus done fantastic job ripping ""mask"" fantasies telling others American exceptionalism. got voted disbelieving Swedes saying thought vaccine would take 10 years. need here. People walking around without masks they're uncomfortable they're masters lying themselves, Big Orange conspiracy.  Yup. closed schools. places children weren’t even allowed leave homes (Madrid one, IIRC).

Anyone spent anytime around children knows frequently sick frequently getting around sick. See kids playing together quickly see little germ factories. got nose swabbed today (3rd time me) didn’t feel like nurse administered went deep nostrils wherever they’ve going cause pain before. going compromise accuracy test?

My hope assholes get severe cases COVID recover new outlook. I've seen articles like now, defend Trump administration's bungling, per capita death rate USA right line nations, several European would consider death rate accurate measure disease prevalence ""confirmed cases"", subject many confounding factors rate testing. least couple years then.  made point invalid comparison. Finally, data differentiates immune responses survived died. 

TLDR; coronavirus 2 proteins invoke immune response. protein N protein.

Those patients’ serology survived showed effective response protein N protein.

Patients died serology showed strong immune response N protein protein... Given excess deaths much higher official probably much. Realistically given complications Covid possible later deaths counting probably Covid related. chance getting Covid low, chance getting Covid dying something else even lower. inflated certainly deaths used make decisions anyway, point going exponentially hard bring control. can't agree say people collectively stupid somewhere like China, example, US.

Give break. disease started China people obsessed eating weird shit there. One big difference China China allows stupid people audience suits country's goals. So, anti-mask protest China, they'd send fucking military re-educate people. government China tight grip information (so disease could got quite bad there, necessarily know), pressure control situation high. Imagine response would governors officials could executed dereliction duties crisis. That's threat really came China point. want live kind government, see seem less shit deal with.

I think biggest problem right comparison China way people elect stupid motherfuckers office. coherent competent government response disaster, would real enforcement rules bunch people seem stupid would fall line cease problem. media US tends give biased view vaccine development, often mentioning efforts US companies (Moderna), efforts US companies involved (Pfizer).

You hear less Oxford/AZ, Sanofi, heaven forbid Sinovac. think key flaw even among people don’t openly flout science. assume staying away strangers they’re taking precautions. can’t tell many people told “yeah i’m careful i’ve seen cousins grandma friends kids...” like strangers grocery store way get it. Inflaming racial tensions literally Putin's playbook. behind response BLM, sluggish coronavirus response, Trump want help poor people. 'I'm afraid Americans' Bingo! agree social distancing, think masks could easily become norm public. I’ve already seen tipping point becoming normal area live, weeks ago still largely non-mask boomer types. rarely see anyone without mask. countries agree probably representing COVID deaths, representing.

And yes, mitigating, mitigating disease objectively less worse 1968 pandemic struck young people prime. parents scared take kid doctor potentially cause striking young people prime.

That problem need address. virus bad, apocalyptic. reaction though could be. starting year kids already quarantine, still plowing ahead. Next Monday PE class 178 48 minutes. see people wearing masks physical distancing. unmaskers simply getting louder ideology failing. remember Biden said xenophobic, fearmongering hysteria. can't win schools give damn; they’re orders above, though. better. good indication going handle future crises. People can't even wear mask social distance consequences face. think there's much hope capacity address something like global warming abstract requires much planning. 
Zoomers' retirement plans going made pissed Generation Omega wielding machetes. even sub then? "" reinfection truly significant *within 6 months initial infection* would see cases already. ""

Again, necessarily discussed elsewhere here. way would true previous hotspots like NYC Wuhan drop infectious precautions let virus freely circulate throughout populations again, simply going happen. previous hotspot going instituting tight controls bring coronavirus R0 well 1, we've seeing New York Wuhan example, already low chances previous COVID-19 patient re-exposed coronavirus become virtually nil. reinfection occurring, due sheer epidemiology public health responses, we'd expecting trickle cases occurring (and even fewer reported). seeing, may may indicate reinfection. got Xbox I’m switching PS5 comes I’ll get Crisis actors get's interesting pandemic many cute little examples ethics class meet reality world demand.

Not saying easy answer, remember reading lead developer one Chinese vaccines taken well got stage 3 approval. Don’t want DOX work large institution US. We’re testing every single student come campus M-Sun rapid testing available year starts. Mandatory masks lots social distancing measures. I’m really nervous it, optimistic. American way!

You argue it’s American way, you’d wrong face. become almost symbolic political like flag thanks leaders weak Democrat wear one.

You need stop pretending like they're pieces fabric incidentally symbolism attached. beyond ridiculous. Flags inherently symbolic designed represent country and, therefore, inherently political. Masks not. Flags also ceremony attached them. supposed displayed certain way even disposed certain way, ironically burning. 

Attacking someone ""disrespecting"" either symbolic token (the flag) ceremony symbolic token takes part never justified, get decide whether person feel offended whatever act deemed disrespecting something SUPPOSED symbolic. want die hill, feel free send drawing ""the Prophet"" sucking camel's dick embassy KSA return address claim ""just ink piece paper"".

Your equating two types attacks strengthens rebuke attacking kneel anthem completely downplay egregiousness attacking somebody simply wearing mask. daddy do. Exactly. universities talking compromised gov't officials. mention rely money. fair lower world 60% against, seems shockingly low.

These numbers staggering. :/ projection far low? 


Assuming prevalence 10X tested positive average 3-5 week lag contracting virus death, US 2M testing positive implied 20 million actual cases. squares new estimate 207k deaths time ( ~1% fatality rate).


Extrapolating forward, 5M testing positive, would imply 50M actual cases, 1 7 Americans. Taking death rate, suggests 300k additional deaths next 5 weeks, 500k total October. haha school goes brrrrr right. responsibility bomb remove democratically elected governments countries expense US taxpayer dollars.

Also can't directly compare flu covid deaths like infinite wisdom, CDC tracks deaths age group different two viruses historical data sets, dumb. find chart comparing flu February till now. super dumb flu season Oct Feb surprise surprise flu death numbers lower. comparing deaths though infections different numbers overall cases. Look instead historical flu death data year year see deaths 18 compare total covid deaths 14 categories see even missing 4 years ages, numbers even close. evidence super clear influenza deadly children covid. contract flu kid, probably fine, chances dying much higher covid. There's better arguments schools closing kids getting covid. annoying trying use science justify shutting schools, reality children risk normal school year. kids go back school kids generally fine normally are, people going complain ""scientists said can't go back school kids die, happen, another example scientists lying"". make claims understand science statistics want fit narrative. Science care narratives.

Kids going back school dangerous teachers spreading parents. dangerous kids. News citing kid illness emotional argument work shut schools riskier pathogens like flu unless really bad. argument instead towards ""how best protest teachers parents students"" focus mitigation efforts there.

All this, coupled least lip service things like human rights equality, positioned us one powerful influential nations history world.

This meant advanced democracy world leader 50+ years post- WWII.

And one short generation starting 9/11 culminating (so far) Trump, we've absolutely pissed everything away name of...what exactly? ""America First""?! idiots realize world leader best thing could advancing interests prosperity.

It take generation undo damage, we've opened door China, country little regard human rights, pre-eminent global superpower. Fucking madness least Trump get wants, remembered. one worst Presidents US history, we'll remember. Every time see health care worker, even it’s janitor wiping handrail, thank service, let know heroes war. Seriously. mean, even get FOXNEWS Montreal :(

Yes can. mobilize nation focus going war China. would wipe source virus, masks need afterwards. Whatever China preventing virus, shall learn that. That's communist thing. can't that.  risking life, others lives well? places require asymptomatic people receive negative test something skews percentage artificially. like people symptoms direct contact positive case tested. would fine article also make guesses claim guesses stuff know sure.  Wtf problem? Easy there, *Victims Communism* project. think missing point bud, yes relative fucking human lives regardless. games themselves, too. It’s funny watching backlash buggy game would waited 50% get anyway. Corona did. Corona forced really silly. bunch soft people wanting roleplay tough hardened people. can't follow rules protect others holding short period time pretend stronger thing break rules instead. 

What disgusting weak people guys are. Yes, population USA 132 million 1940, whereas 331 million now.

Correcting population, WWII death rate would 730,000 people today. 

I surprised see USA approach exceed figure, especially election produces anything really clear-cut victory Biden, yet. imagine going thing period. like good party, Sturgis biggest sausagefest history parties. Oh I'm sure there's 50+ skanks nothing worth damn. I'm sorry given better options. wish best; loss. enough reason model shouldn’t trusted forecast deaths. fucking fuck.  Positivity rate always mandate U.S CDC CDCs around world use judge general medical understanding virus spreads. 

Educate America testing wrong people chunk pandemic duration. 

When testing efforts cannot keep spread virus, end huge number tests, high positivity rate little understanding asymptomatic patients. USA #1 Americans care countrymen, care others countries.

Most caring #1 themselves. course, full nano machines need worry biological viruses software ones.  anyone read paper? 2.2 million projection would happen nothing changed, authors said unlikely. mean US came delivered victory punch allowed allies win war. US full participant war, come 0.32% Americans died war? Compared like 9% Nazi Germany, 14% Soviet Union, 4% Japan, 4% China, 2.5% Finland, 0.94% UK. 

Clearly dodged bullets. 

Funding war actually participating war human lives. Sweden funded allies ball bearings shit, funded Nazi's steel iron ball bearings. even gave allies 15% discount, really pissed Germans off. 

The modern ball bearing invented Sweden 1907 played big roll war. SKF held exclusive rights radial ball bearings used airplane motors, tanks, automobiles, guns, submarine engines similar war material. Vastly important war. noted SKF provided even substantial discounts Britain’s ball bearings purchases Germany’s.73 Table II shows 1938, SKF charged British 74% price Germany material, 1943 figure dropped 68%. discounts list prices commercial decisions agreed part trade negotiations.   reasons choice quality domestically produced bearings. post‐war British government report bearings industry maintains ball bearings difficult replicate, citing 1940 1941 attempt rapidly expand industry supply shortfall created blockade Sweden. presumably applies equally Germans. Ball bearings exactly sized perfectly round, without defects ensure long‐term use high stress applications engines. metallurgy, machinery machine processes difficult reverse engineer; virtually impossible produce identical ball bearing wear way. 

Sweden's big role war basically playing sides prevent getting invaded Germans. Definitely important part keeping war going. 

Having 100 military deaths though... Sweden completely dodged war. one cares anymore. concept human life value nothing facade country, existing serve agenda, ignored not. Yes actually happens it’s risky landlord really can’t complain “business” goes under. f's ran sometime mid July. part check family week, I've stepped soap box. There's plenty others willing carry torch. Even don’t give shit old people, “mostly” isn’t good enough. Thousands upon thousands non-old people died. WELL COMPLETE UTTER SURPRISE  Fauci say schools safe reopen. short nightmare scenario asymptomatic transmissible two weeks, followed 100% mortality rate. Idk man, Guadalcanal, Phillippines, Coral Sea, Midway pretty active. So?. gives shit. get violent idiot protesters fucking dumbasses rioting. means nothing anymore. can't start pretend caring now. Crazy works. Doubt Trump admin anything (directly) though. CDC still independent. Gotta look closer numbers seems silly me. Wear mask improve lot life making things better everyone else; selfishly choose spread disease making self vulnerable. even question? Oooohhh, explains lot. Sorry misreading comment, never thought would encounter one guys. Goodbye, well guess? Count dead dead...

Let know consider significant difference. Nah, believe things backed logic actual data. It’s 23 now. Japan isnt well either last heard. Repeated mistake opening economy way early. Gotta salarymen working 16-hour shifts kissing bosses ass know? Calm down, Jon Groff. Bro dropped 5G somewhere there. Clearly problem letting viral photos get there. everyone’s infected!

I say people time time, blank stares sight behold. sure I'm getting through. try.  There's absolute overwhelming amount death cases occurring predominantly Democrat areas. Brace continuing wear masks. clean idiots right planet. probably troll I'll take risk chance helps someone. 

N95s best (but near impossible find now), materials serve weaker filters spit catchers. quick Google search lead studies different mask materials. except fleece better nothing.

Fabric masks helpful preventing sick person spreading covid, also somewhat reduce likeliness catching Christians aren’t young earth creationists. YEC wrong, straight up. There’s absolutely way earth 6000 years old, majority people don’t deny it.  5th wedding anniversary October hoping finally go year. I’m sad we’ll miss milestone, risk everyone involved worth it.

America made public health (a pandemic) political issue never understand? Nope bunch people don’t care bc it’s affecting directly reality likely 32 million cases, testing sucked continues suck (a lot less march/april/may, still sucks) path forward keep increasing testing contact tracing. Free medicine? talking about? Americans expect pay money medicine. 

Animal shelters found must charge adoption animals. Animals free treated poorly. 

Likewise, Americans expect pay medicine. cost, perceived value goes window. Medicine cost worthless stupid Americans equate price value. developed countries socialized medicine citizens don’t think like do.

I think question goes show Americans warped something universal right something elite afford. 10 15 years wait. Almost million people died already covid. FDA granting approval means believe benefits vaccination significantly outweigh unknown risks could side effects. I'm going getting vaccine, getting covid. everyone's choice make, know making right choice. wear clothes, find hard wear masks? 

We restrict airflow crotches girls wear restricting bras, simple mask much? claimed could blm protestors one mentioned before. Bringing blm protestors claim. back up? reason specifically mentioned them? Yeah 1% dying OK...unless them. Around 500,000 people die annually due tobacco use, something government control over, that’s pandemic. numbers standpoint, shut economy save 500,000 people tobacco industry survive thrive match number next year. thought!

Ultimately, looks like Sweden got right.. generation gone depression competent leadership helm.

So yeah, definitely rooting too. There's women ages daddy issues, mental disabilities &amp; drug dependencies latch bikers biker gangs sorts things questionable consent/coercion. Think people relationships main people Tiger King. were. anymore. 

I agree people high risk stay home. people need support families. agree theory that's poor way express Possibly October really understand Republicans idea masks. Even politically make sense. weird sort moral stance taking, hurt fellow Republicans reelection chances.

If Democrats wear masks, Republicans wear masks, Republicans suffer coronavirus Democrats. suffer consequences getting sick, suffer financial issues relating getting sick, etc. make sense would this. 

Republicans lose support Republican votes traditionally older, voters could literally die. know strategy simply make sense even best case worst case scenarios.

Republicans, smart, would tell everyone wear masks dump money unemployment stimulus hope win election.  fair Ned's dad, ever asked Gene Krupa go boombooboom bapbapbap boombooboom bapbapbap boom bap tingggg won’t. Doomers never wrong. I'm guy replying I'm deeply side implementing preventative measures - ask literally social distancing, mask wearing avoidance public places groups *indefinitely* norm, I'm going say no. People can't, won't, live like that. Help, we're held hostage Republicans. Apparently Constitution means nothing, cops armed like military can't fight back, neighbors also armed like military careful. remedy except voting, also controlled Republicans. we're trying stay alive pandemic we've lost jobs running money. asking collective alcoholics they're danger? even kids don’t get sick often...

Enough enough. people want stubbornly reckless, deserve told we’d better die. That’s literally thing keep harming others. They’ve proven it. Nothing change minds. Yeah! I’ve lived little year sort thought SoCal similar politics, quickly realized it’s not. seems though right leaning folks loud it. “the government can’t tell body” folks apply mentality masks social distancing. 

The Bay Area much strict guidelines Newsom. seems helped (except places). don’t really keep what’s opened closed anymore don’t go unless need to. 

It’s mind boggling health safety concern soooo political. “right” “freedom” ruined us. Congratulations!! moron year award!! lot competition year, sir madam, WON! lifetime supply crayons lead paint chips?

Stick nose eat them, respectively? Brilliant!!

Seriously though, ""young"" people dying. Perhaps volume elderly, are. symptomatic died, likely lives changed forever. symptomatic, knows what's going happen 20 years. simply dont know. Fauccis picture says lol humans always done, adapt. Change constant. able accept life always same. isn't. read international news regularly multiple languages (I know comes across, whatever), stories ubiquitous. US media invested showing countries' successes, understandable, failures exist, too, culture allows endemic USA Anglosphere generally. dogmatism!, repeat it, again, again, again. I’m happy stuck middle I’ve stayed home since March see others going like nothings changed. *cheers* Either trolling need unsmooth math brain, gits shiggles: Canada 4 deaths, US 10x population, proportional deaths 40. Actual deaths 1290. 1290/40=32.25.

Typing out, I'm actually hard time believing numbers myself, that's math. Watching family member struggle breathe shuts lot people right fuck conspiracies. Americans think socialism imagine Soviet Union depicted US media.  fair, mask compliance live high. comes case case basis. 

In states covered unemployment insurance leave work health concerns flu leave lifelong issues, comparison. Polio would closer threat level 50% pf Polio vaccine useless Children Future.

Infect well let lead stats.. New York!""

Hello outside Charlotte. Heard alot. Still dum dums.  


I tell ACE2 receptors everyone else NY world. look like I'm speaking Greek. science goes heads. do. really do. majority us deeply concerned taking actions keep others safe. loud minority people making us look like morons. paid Russian apparatchiks (and many losers actually paid) fiercel protective shithole country. Anything dear leader disaster pandemic response gets tide downvotes. FOUR?! one -- LACK COMMON SENSE.  That’s false equivalency. hate defend it. Seriously. eating alive it... Ebola clearly dangerous fuck. outwardly fucks shit up. Nobody downplay damage open. 

With Covid, people asymptomatic transmitting thousands. 

Even Ebola highly contagious, it’s hell lot easier like “yep, got Ebola!” yep got COVID.

And what’s death rate COVID now? Like 1% areas? Ebola upwards 30-40%. mean, that’s good comparison all. many Americans look like potatoes? told you....DO stay long indoors shopping!

Not sure would cause exhaustion immediate symptoms show caught, GF wore mask went inside store shop spent hour there....I read good stay indoors public place long, fear may compromised herself.....anybody? Everybody wearing mask store, keeping distance etc., obviously mask prevent catching virus....

hence concern That’s true. We’ve declining steadily. hit 1,300 one day one time went down. 900, 800, back 1000, 800 on. I'm okay this, let virus cleanse stupid. fuck writes ""a 8?"" Journalism really went downhill Even Disney open? Guess risks match rewards  Alcohol doesn’t cause drunk driving, driving drunk causes drunk driving. That’s like seeing duck calling orange.

The reason cigarettes aren’t illegal tobacco lobby damn much money.

We 5 million cases, peoples actions. Combine “re-opening” done money, exactly they’re wishing us. Seems fair wish too. CDC lists average 3.3%. Love whole sequence comments. Maybe bring lynching back style behave then. ""Don't care?""

That's problem. Way many Americans simply don't. Man, I'm fucking sick hearing left &amp; right. POLITICS! POLITICS PLACE PANDEMIC COUNTRY SITTING ARGUING LIKE FUCKING CHILDREN THEM. ""UNITED"" STATES FUCKING ASS. 

""the left hate america."" ""the right care you"" STFU! TIME STEREOTYPICAL BULLSHIT! WANT BEAT PANDEMIC NOT????? LOVE AMERICA WANT BEAT VIRUS ASAP! Let keep safe, face consequences. Oh? source claim? Hello fellow sane Floridian stupid title. Half Europe higher fatality rate US. Guess Europeans bad math average Redditor. good look, EU friends.  Same. people know even initially reasonable completely blown precautions. like others know want make safe getting f*cked idiots vastly outnumber us. point stay hell home watch depressing train wreck, come sometimes come contact people - I’ve go pharmacy, veterinarian dogs, ect. it’s nerve wracking. thought people would see sense things got worse. It’s opposite. said, it’s like everyone lost minds. I'm thankfully kids seem affected adults. I'm picu NP place already seen quashed peak. really get many cases. mixed (kids adults) hospital definitely getting adult overflow. 

You teach picu nurse adult ICU nurse faster teach adult med surg nurse ICU nurse Try thots pears? Remember back ""at war"" ""invisible enemy"" coronavirus? we're losing war, we've decided send child soldiers front lines. Yes, kind idiots nothing take polls?  Europeans may read this, many us care. Sadly country without leader Three half years idiots among population extremely loud. Stop living fear. Covid 19 death sentence. wear masks stores etc, outside home. going store fine. Im Minnesota though, safe. problems. Actually, we're getting ready open public schools pandemic, tried nothing, we've actually tried less nothing, working actively make things worse.

The leadership country incompetent best (Democrats), treasonous worst (Republicans), either way result going same: lot dead US citizens. Still lower world went 1300 day 300 night. exactly, tell ""I research shit due diligence"" reedit I've seen initial studies estimate obese, chances dying virus go high 20%. Live free spread COVID lose money go hospital treatment 

Yeah, money lose... money actually right moment dying? hospital laugh face tell gtfo. stabilize us, *treat*. Oh, wasn’t trying attack undermine „dedication“. 

I simply wanted say reason vaccines usually take long. 

I often said I‘d getting vaccine when/if available public end year/beginning next year. 

For personally deemed around year development testing safe get it.(So beginning next year ~January.  backyard birthday barbecue Nana! Family coming everywhere one wish happy 80th birthday! far Florida! wife's throat little sore long day daycare, got hair done felt little better, ready kiss grandma! bars! Biggest study kind, tracking 20,000 students/teachers 100 different schools England summer, published later. Understanding risks involved keeping schools shut well-being children, along fact there’s “very little evidence” significant coronavirus spread schools definitely weigh government decision making. Whether case countries different would harder tell, UK didn’t easy ride summer. Suck cow titties Saw “if masks works protest sign”

Ignorance real Idk RSI looks overheated. see 50 day moving average? I’ve received ballot almost month advance 6 years.  you’re doctor!! guess 8 trillion people infected flu let's keep counting. Fucking geniuses lol Don’t forget birther conspiracy Obama playing way much golf started trump himself. No. agree that. meant that:

1. friends, one wearing mask, people bound comment it. 

2. lot people, epecially YA, feel bit insecure 1. Well least bit since ""you're trying fit in"" ""be cool"", ""be different"" get made fun of. Hence, respect comes play. parks outdoor areas New Hampshire clogged months. normally summer anyway, ridiculous many people packing trying get away. several waterfalls closed amount trash people leaving behind. ??? Look worst case scenario model. 98th percentile deaths Nov 1 would barely put us pace 300k Dec. 300k year isn’t happening evidenced source backup. antivax crowd can't tell fact fiction.  actual blunder would barely register. Tennessee opposite... Damn.. least three things something people well covid. I’m sick conservative family flipping statistics around saying “well it’ll give us herd immunity.” Like what??????????? people jail prisons even work (it choice work outside cell even assigned work one forcing anything inmates , internal services like culinary rationing, humane. outlook many cases poor, taking hospital would change odds. Grandma would intubated probably suffer brain damage lack oxygen transport. Lewt alone spend last moment bunch unknowns full PPE.

Providing palliative care familair surrounding right thing do. yeah, maybe 1 grandma could saved (and again, condition), 59 would suffer horrendously last moments. ""dealing"" way tried prevent it, going bad time. 42% sounds optimistic me. Zap who? reference Lord Farquad Shrek. rational logical approach this. Given I've told county...what myself, wife, kids? comorbidities. continue social distance since March? friends family gone back ""normal"" speak. chosen virtual option first semester school would nice eat restaurants start going places again. Europeans behaving like Americans even worst.

Beaches full, (few) events take place, people go work public transportation, streets often crowded, restaurants open, bars terraces functioning (with special conditions).

Why would Europeans moral right critic US?

The reason US registering many cases test 100 times European nations. That's why. US cases mild asymptomatic. even count. would count number mild cases flu every year, entire population would get books. conservatives weirdly obsessed violent crime statistics cities live Exactly, long flavor message people disregard everything else. really quite shocking honestly hard comprehend. assumptions never questioned.

Good know USPS can’t handle tax returns, property tax bills, utility bills, credit card bills - going places also. way around.

Divided stand, United fall. 

That feels right wrong situation. want see Ireland place world. promise won’t set foot country behind us.

You’re right fear American travelers. taking thing seriously enough. I'm Midwest read post one Trumpy Bear commercials came on. thought absurdity appropriate. care way lean, everything feels touch reality imo.

If know wtf Trumpy Bear is, Google search however feel it, add appropriate response thanks.

Eta: point get wild Midwest one way another. Simply looking tell dumb science deniers. Regarding down-votes, know feel. admit desire people like write, little bit hurtful. Sometimes post unpopular, mean bad information wrong. Reddit community interesting conversations, design echo chamber, hostile nuance. Conservative ideas 100% wrong liberal ideas 100% right. progress ever going make areas room disagreement. That's true. Though suppose COVID could also mutate. took money they’re saving bus students school run school, could make babysitter grant fund pay babysitters. Would put unemployed people back work solution this. trump Plus, isolated least isolated person visit. like STDs. might sex one person *ever* might trust person much. person sleeps 10 people, risk STD goes almost much slept 10 people.

Family carry disease. Family take risks comfortable taking yourself.

Sorry, know I'm preaching choir. must it. never brave enough politics. two issues. coronavirus plague. America plague everyone else 6foot pole. gonna lie, Ive smoking 20 years, know/never met anyone went jail month weed. nobody goes jail this. know plenty idiot old democrats won’t wear mask. LOL.  Logic furthest thing mind.  driven fear emotion, thats it. one side people reject science shows masks may effective. side people reject science shows regions may approaching herd immunity. Imagine trying pretend hospital residents way representative general population.


That’s like estimating height average Americans based NBA basketball team. Exactly. Schools get shot say 1% *blah, blah, blah*...

What people expect wanted open schools?

They probably think them.  Every time someone criticizes China r/Coronavirus, guys bring America. Yes, get it, America fucked up, doesn’t make China innocent. Can’t guys think better response doesn’t involve America? like logical outcome. want violence. put words mouth. interesting. experience complete opposite. Nearly everyone know sensible gets science wears mask. internet see lot conspiracy theories bullshit.  post wrong spot? think incoherent rant anything comment answering? ""You"" keep talking to?

You getting flipped consensus science changed dramatically first weeks now. think learn science works. Exactly. disgusting traitor Reds country l. pray enough Trump family. Fuckin killed America hurting world long time nobody including people America done anything. Quite frankly, nobody happy call american. Nazis socialists name, argument?

Look history state defense forces national guard. second amendment made standing army trusted. says national guard mean state separate independently operated serve country that's state militias for. There's concept called overshooting. ""herd immunity"" threshold 60% mean infections magically stop 60%. people currently sick population gets 60% continue spreading effective R 1, results quite people sick effective R low enough finally stop spread. fact, homogeneous population, final infected number 90% disease R0 2.5.

Of course, populations homogeneous. general benefits us society, means herd immunity threshold less 60%. However, works kids schools. rate covid spreads school lot higher 2.5 considering students confined rooms hours time. reason jails get close 100% (not I'm comparing schools jails general, terms spreading infectious diseases).

Even none true 60% figure correct, saying number dead kids 100% spread might problematic, okay number 60%?

Hopefully little bit educational stop lashing people correct bad math. Tweets concert made laugh.
Funny...but 3.5 number people died tested positive. aren’t considering kids, heathy people, older people. simply amount people positive died. It’s actually less 3.2%. I’m saying 3.2% chance dying covid, I’m saying test positive 3.2% chance according case mortality rate. analogy might slightly flawed, would apply eating chips virus already. don’t virus chance dying almost zero assumes first contract virus fall victim 3.2% population. 

Glad that’s settled now. summer US, hot summer, too, that's anything lower infections. Half us care, half us think giving shit makes dick shrivel Don’t forget “you can’t that” understand people concerned. would brand-new vaccine brand-new virus discovered less year ago, still don’t fully understand, don’t know long-term effects of.

Like medicine, [the scientists create vaccines immune making I’d guess margin error lot wider we’re talking new disease. diseases vaccine developed quickly first discovered? so, would reassure little. That's radicalized. BS? Check yourself. Times pushing it. Australian pushing it. Someone Downing 10 needs good news friend. Connect dots. 

Btw freakin' love StroopWafels. Germany wouldn't. There's green card program something. say make someone believes die they're going paradise give shit safety people earth?    Good. follow rules deserve get sick. That's ridiculous. Many medications followed 24 months. many cases, authorized long date. one insisting protocols violated. unethical biomedical POV refuse administer medication sufficient data indicate reduces net harm they're fucking pregnant, holy shit, tell kind parents they'll be, poor kid, future doomed. want point UK counting deaths community well. highly doubt US let alone kind accuracy. Bars closing 10pm state. sure going major increase smaller campus gatherings. Maybe lose limb two. show em. guy replying to, lot actions rather words. work retail area that's relatively taking seriously.

People changed act within stores. still crowd next people. buy drinks go around drinking masks off. pull masks talk. People get inches ask questions ignore backing away.

I coworkers still wanting take vacations planned it, driving states stuff that's closed here. roommates still guests go visit people.

So no. majority taking seriously, really broadcast people significantly egregious states. think America country world drug abuse violence? That’s cute. No, it’s sets awful precedent moron. Fantasize people’s deaths dumb ape. American passports become useless right, 500 children total european union study Stockholm winter holiday week 9, February 24 March 1. Norway, Denmark rest Sweden preceding weeks. see pattern? 

It also important note virus spreads mainly returning travelers, visiting tourists. trying summarize sentiment feel like linking 100 different articles Trump winks nods people wear masks. pregnant woman whose told doctor there’s evidence support Covid dangerous pregnant women terrifies me. I’m Canada! feel pregnant women right now, especially America. wonder many people die result healthcare due unemployment caused shutdown. Whether that’s physical death financial death they’re crippled debt rest lives. see people wearing masks shops right widespread enforced. government encouraging us stock masks said community transmission inevitable back masks made mandatory Clearly everything power cover best can, democrats revel every Covid death makes Trump look bad. agencies bought paid for. I’m saying Covid isn’t real, numbers way inflated. Also skewed idiot governors putting Covid patients nursing homes killing thousands.  Symptoms *usually* show quickly, would take longer 24 hours feel sick. 

If everyone wearing mask respecting 6ft, risk great. worry unless starts showing symptoms

If want info disease look for:  works giving mass injections kids southern high scools him, definitely read like “all wars ever” me.

Unless culling weak, species whole fail become extinct. antivaxxers, flat-earthers, climate change deniers, antimaskers coming LONG time. sucks rest us dragged them... gave equation feel free input numbers yourself. oh Hi fake account. hell Sturgis, people like this?

Edit: mean, people they’re showing Sturgis rally, wearing masks? brother rights motorcycle special mask wears keeps dust dirt lungs wouldn’t wearing mask second nature?

This wildly inaccurate. First off, America basically funded war begining. Lend-lease program, Allies actually infrastructure supply military. America, Russia would unable relocate renstate industrial capabilities handle German advance.

Secondly, America participated major allied offensives European theatre (North Africa, Italy, D-Day). America entered war Allies lost entire content Europe, Britain holding onto edge cliff fingernails. Britain barely fended German bombers little show it. dodging war?

Thirdly, America almost single-handedly fought Pacific war. time America entered war, half China lost British colonies SEA seized Japan (while posing real threat Australia). reversals pacific came America's involvement.

I disagree schools indeed important kids need them....
...I disagree opening RIGHT NOW.

The traditional brick mortar, traditional services even feasible follow CDC guidelines. guidelines state area open infection rates certain percentage (In places, well right now...was 5%?).
The thing kids need stability. open close, quarantine 14 days, come back, repeat ad nauseum.
If START online learning, actually apply (eLearning powerful budget needed train put necessary things place).
Speaking budget. Schools practically nothing work far funding goes first place. suddenly faced extra things extra money it. Yeah, going half-assed.

Another facet everything, people parents thinking whole ordeal overblown, fake, etc...there teachers camp well. That's downright dangerous.

Lastly (and means exhaustive everything), seeing evidence covid works children. may display many symptoms, may already easily, fact remains setting like school, viral load much higher masks not. spreading families teachers.

-Some R politician, probably. evidence weak doesn’t even give anecdotal examples real research. asked reinfections simply says, “Yes, indeed. may accurate number gotten infected again. call say 'Doctor, recovered admitted hospital two three months ago.' already warned many interviews, based research reports China places...”

Did post scare people? William Henry Harrison better president Trump. That’s saying something. seen many terry cloth wash rags. wild. Keep mind back March/April, pessimistic forecasts said US would 60K deaths defeat pandemic August... CDC's excess mortality data shows 200,000 Americans may died already.

For example, small study article discussed skin symptoms. Even many articles read skin issues, seemed focus ""frostbite"" like presentation much beyond that. article talked rash rather blue toes, fingers. said people skin rashes 40%more likely test positive corona 6% peole found skin rash symptom nothing else. 

I personally experienced bad rash couple months back. Abnormally sensitive itchy, painful/irritated thought turned dermatitis debated going Dr figured sort bug bite cluster. lasted weeks maybe slowly went away. never even considered corona talking coworker recently described exact mysterious rash (even presentong areas back/torso). I'm trying get antibody testing done heard back Dr yet. 

Its frustrating bc there's much talk one two symptoms much else thats reportedly showing. wonder many cases grouped asymptomatic bc theres enough awareness nontraditional symptomology.  Can't full genome sequencing particular infection check resembles virus looked months ago looks like ""up date""?

The virus constantly mutating suppose possible see relapse reinfection comparing new infections area. what's safe, what's profitable. actually even what's profitable long term, half-assery dragging entire thing out. Yes, many holding getting vaccinated result, there's substantial evidence safe. limited initial testing, may possible aware potential side effects (immediate long term) implemented larger scale, plenty science minded folks may let fellow citizens serve guinea pigs there's data available.

Understandable: Governor you’ve got world-class gaslighter 😣 Can't get drug tested job anymore. *taps head* work home talking friends do/dont wear masks. Anytime go grocery pick takeout, mask thr car. last month, I've started putting mask go drive-thru. dont wear mask get gas unless go inside. Paying thr pump. dont see need mask. go walk, dont bother mask, pass someone. move away other. Friend mine wears mask anytime leaves house, even get mail. Hey now, forgot hourly board member parent calls threatening job absurdly mundane details wildly corrupt ""ideas"" quietly inform ""likely illegal Steve."" Darwinism. someone could spin narrative think government wants wear masks thin heard they'd turn sides. People dying lower rate 20% hospitalized long term health effects. It’s death rate. like idea changing building codes, quite rational, good luck convincing everyone there. Change easier professed perpetuated.

Only N95 approved FDA, handling mask wrong would contaminate wearers face mask.


Did miss nurses stating this? practically every news channel story face masks.

Did miss supply shortage stories?

The ""how disenfect"" N95 mask stories?


Doctors scientists going recommend unapproved treatments cures think may even dangerous.


Stay home, 6ft strangers safer wearing mask fidgeting day contacting people.


Sorry upset Fauci recomend PPE safe.


With lockdowns easing, people coming contact people. people touch faces anyway, mask mask. trained medical professionals don't, call screw up.

In scenario, masks safer mask, even bandanas. similar limitations colors, early 90's, small Kansas town 3k people, 2 hours major city.

The Satanic Panic fears gangs absurd begin even communities like mine. taken currently resisting masks calling everything like Marxist fake news. sounds good I’m theory realize world small place global economies interconnected.

These people stupid. Every goddamned last one them. 3 feet? like within 2-3 meters. Disease war comparable. 650-700k deaths USA Spanish flu. Less 1% death among healthy? mean? excessive deaths reported March July reported deaths Coronavirus far counted point making 3.3% death rate substantially lower reality. Tough times everyone get much worse. Kids need school socialization, doubt. Looking early numbers everywhere schools opened seems disastrous solution. Wait see much money family makes vaccine, chose one least invested in. showed corona spread like wildfire among children. new. Same, lived 5 years don’t believe post lol  Lizard King Live free die baby! /s Another interesting Gates though US leadership dig idea greatest testing can’t admit close pointless.  Private companies therefore get paid useless tests incentives faster try report back.... Uh... Prioritizing tests likely pass virus largest number others makes flawlessly perfect sense. sucks people end government officials whatnot, people need put prideforks look math. kIdS GeT iT! appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* symbolism two horned, two winged helm red star forehead synonymous neo-pagan imagery horned god, harbinger death. red, white, black official colors Nazi Germany. building old style playground really encourage social distancing welcome students pandemic, feels poignant.

It effects old ill people worse. protected. 

This coronaviris craze blunder decade government fairly effective countering actual virus, rather spineless terms halting travel; stop flights Italy late March/early April repeated Americans. think days ago. omits context whatsoever? war 60 years ago less half many people utterly irrelevant except click baiting fear mongering.

Here’s context: 620,000 people die heart disease one bat eye it’s utterly normal amount.

This entire sub unhinged. us didn’t much fighting tho Japanese islands short Africa campaign invasion Europe costly rather short Exactly, congratulations understand point : war made less people die preventable virus. nice day hesitate ask questions still confused! Love cops supposed protect people? Instead bunch egotistical power hungry shit stains. feel sorry guy gets severe level rona, kills people cares stricken grief --who kidding, guy care anyone! Aging roster, Brady left, multiple championships recently gotten big money contracts already

Don't blame em really ruin doom gloom. literally worse WW2.  I'm claiming I'm skeptical. can't approach skepticism saying burden proof skeptic. That's get 58% Americans side. argument literally transmissible disease? fear Americans around too. sucks I'm American. accurate, 400k us soldier deaths. another fear mongering post. fuck people post shit like this, enough misinformation virus. Exactly. 

It simply means powerless anything it, way family used it. 

And hate that, always something. That's 56.67% spokesperson said positives came University tests, rounded down.  guys talking about? around 1k deaths per day @ 161k total cases curve clearly going down. get 600k deaths, keep pace almost 2 years lol. Stay calm vote smart Isolation hasn’t working well, that’s almost 1,000,000 deaths around world date sign slowing down. Sure, it’s uncommon vaccines require long decade gain FDA approval, covid vaccine able put market quickly due number reasons. SARS outbreak 2003 result slightly different similar coronavirus. Research helped fast track development current coronavirus outbreak’s vaccine. Moderna vaccine currently developed enlisted 33,000 people placebo controlled study test vaccine. goes well, large enough sample size confident safety get vaccine myself. I’d rather risk astronomically low chance side effect vaccine instead real likely chance get covid. would say Africa whole far worse people realize. Even South Africa case counts aren’t accurate due lack tests looting funds meant covid relief amongst many things. agency reported officials worried gains may threat people refusing get tested, using government's contact tracing app, following hygiene guidance. 

That's solid worries there, really requires administration pays attention testing capability, closed contract tracing, reliable trustworthy guidance even worry them. rights stop start infringing others rights. They’re right life examples. ignoring lockdowns infringing protected right Life. None things extremely contagious viruses barely prevent though, wouldn’t good comparison. otherwise wouldn’t able die talking someone. Everything listed action. Also, wasn’t original point. talking age, I’m saying age factored in, fuckton younger people died. It’s pointless mention old people know fact kills lot young people. *nice* think someone actually back March April running pro Trump states. I’m correct threatened cease desist?! I'm trying advise advocate people. Fuck 'em. Let burn out. Ebola also much harder spread bc uses fluids spread... aerosoled droplets like Corona school literally went viral way media works nowadays, headlines likely 'Up 360.000 Americans Dead Covid December' Covid. like flu kills hundred kids per year. uniquely focused Covid accustomed flu flu deaths don’t make news. Covid much dangerous overall flu, almost entirely deadly Covid older/elderly people. kids flu. KiDs CaN't GeT iT! made unsubstantiated claim refused back up.

You used word science, think know means reason. assure anti-vax. fully vaccinated children. trust science fine. However, it’s clear good portion leadership care science all. president clearly wants magically go away. He’s consistent making wrong choices selfishness lack concern people like me. discouraged masks promoted doctor believes demon sperm. doesn’t like CDC, WHO, goddamn post office. don’t trust anything happens administration, think it’s fucked would blame lack trust selfish, demented con man currently absolute astoundingly poor leadership job experienced lifetime.

This America. Wear eye protection. Boom.


Seriously though many people discounting eye protection. Ane asy vector virus get is, gonna make fun retarded comments like decided point stupid real time. Congrats bootlicking imbecile.  Phase 3 trials show us side effects. minimal show up, good. would likely die covid get rare side effects.

If 80% population gets vaccine, everything goes back normal less 1 10,000 people suffered major side effects. Would ease worry? I'm glad dismiss it. Many right now. 

Big picture thinking needs multiple pieces viewpoints, detachment. Detachment defensive mechanism. Everyone suffers everyone suffered, increased suffering pandemic response pandemic caused overwhelming difficult think about. people decide think all. Suffering cannot quantified statistics deaths values equation people become numbers. 

Regardless, hope take care stay safe this. wish ill suffering anyone, matter worldview.  Honestly point think I'm pro-virus vote island gets them? Australia default type thing?

ETA: could build island. lot people 20s learned yet. tend think they're invincible usually lesson hard though. I'm bit angry mostly feel sorry her. vaccine ever developed quickly won’t really know long term safety point. Yes one spreading bad news instead spreading something positive.

People die everyday, nothing new there. darwinism works. Compassion? talking about? 
 
It's one thing refrain going bar wellbeing 70 year-olds. injecting possibly dangerous substance? That's ""basic human decency"", that's trading health theirs.  'Murica kicked errybody's asses big 2 themselves! Pretty sure due quickly kills people, whether kills people. Time spent transmittable mattet. Ebola kills spread. covid killing people day 30 infection, we'd absolutely fucked. yall laughed Bernie said exactly would happen. Well sure came late. 

It's well documented cavalier suicidal american soldiers entered war. guess people downvoting dont like characterization. clear eyewitness accounts american officers soldiers going, lack better term, postal germans. 

The euros were, understandably, confused shocked behavior. Amazing thing none local cops wearing masks either. JFC time proven deaths ""falsified"" counting ""flu like"" death covid right now? tired fucking sheriffs. Denying science inst job, seem think is. Wash hands Yea good excuse get hands washing in. others said get much clean hand sanitizer. pretty simple wash hands turn nozzles elbows grab paper towel without touching anything else. Shit, heard that! definitely get attention. Regardless, sounds like vaccine least provide limited benefit obese people, guess still worth getting. funny I'm obese (working it, hard genuinely love food dislike forms exercise) I've never gotten flu strep went three years without cold. immune system generally great can't explain why. would much worse close schools earlier year, opening going better?

People travel business kids, people work hospitals kids, kids spread around take home. They've always petri dishes. certainly true experience. voted McCain 2008 grew rural conservative area. 4 years college education later, proudly voted Obama Hillary 2016. Anyone care copy/ pasta. Article behind paywall Including international media? People yell “fake news” read see something don’t like disagree with. Reality something deny goes away.... 

I wouldn’t disagree media may trustworthy people disagree scientists, doctors healthcare experts.... high school diploma whatever liberal arts degree there’s reasoning them. 

If distrust science there’s hope you. definitely go hospital waste doctor’s time you’ve part problem instead solution. 
You can’t disagree doctors, flaunt social distancing guidelines, get infected go see one help 😒

May well throw away medication maybe phone invented scientists... would people outdoor bicycle tour need masks? They’re outdoors presumably moving fast enough spend 15 minutes close contact anybody else. Imagine disconnected reality. heat kill me, COVID will. Cheers you. Sadly, right. Nope, almost anyone suspects is. estimates seem .5% .8% (id actually say .6% precise estimate right now, although probably never know sure it’s always slightly changing gain new knowledge treatment) Let people life life, scared stay home. wear mask, I'm shape, young enough I'm worried. summer man, enjoy it. Life short. Even living east coast, watched daily briefings impressed seemed taking issue earnestly aggressively. I'm sure much leadership blame vs stupid-arse citizens, would assumed, months ago, California would one better states now, perhaps even model follow... Yeah oops, unfortunately way reported bar Brooklyn dozens people, unmasked, sidewalk inside. Places neighborhood following rules, bar can, too. ""You can't that. go cases."" /s

Some counter arguments thread show us good math skills. wonder people believe science never good science math.  Wisconsin: city live (Milwaukee) surrounding big cities following governors mask mandate. north recently people live normal lives believe it’s hoax. Yes, hoax, even real. Everywhere went beside casino told take weren’t needed. Truly astonishing. Wearing mask, social distancing, avoiding large gatherings literally least do, enough people it. It’s epic crisis solution requires almost nothing terms sacrifice yet, still can’t it. not. Sorry hear that. sold mine 5 years ago, looking new one recently. Good luck eventual move! frustrating see folks giving damn virus. get happen get virus nearly every election year (correct I’m wrong) reason people take lightly like it’s nothing. Yet amount deaths happening daily still say something like “The flu bad it’s killed people.”
Okay, cares flu killed people, matter people dying. responsible part helping spread virus. 
Here Texas we’ve got lot folks truly don’t give damn. Fucking mental decided 40 mins later already Health Minister said ""fear people take parties home"" .. then? also understand sure may survive, sacked thousands dollars medical debt long lasting side effects fully understood yet longevity. Dying probably best case scenario compared horrors survival stories, people losing limbs, permanent mental organ damage learn basically function again. without insurance many lost due tied jobs able afford. Shit goes south real quick could land hospital 8 weeks ringing bill millions easily. want know many FDA-approved drugs market serious adverse effect rates higher haha parents genuinely worried pedophiles, they’d stay far away conservatives seem promote. Statistically. Strong evidence coming supporting school reopenings. balance risk disease spread mental health physical health risks posed continued school still lower Europe's. magically go away.

Just like sanity. Sweden finally back control, yes. Spain peaked earlier. Right South America US/Mexio, along south africa hot spots. ME, russia, India rough bad time. world respects us now. /s People died unnecessarily lot countries. pretty obvious countries like Norway, Denmark Finland odd ones. people bashing Netherlands? Belgium? UK? USA? Brazil? Etc etc much Sweden?

And countries start realize, hey, Sweden's strategy maybe wrong one all. 

Maybe people countries focus shit instead bashing Sweden every chance get. one advocating release violent offenders... they’re advocating release non violent offenders cause sentence DEATH No, unstoppable. countries proven unstoppable.

The stupidity, however, persuaded. way Tawnee trailer park model one time. Freedom Masks! Oh shit. Stupid American Virus spreading. like there. Walked line, tip towed crossed. reported ""incivility"" along comments. expect remove well, unless think calling someone ""heartless prick"" ""dumb af"" falls category ""completely civil"", case blaring obvious bias would showing, it? grocery store can't keep 12 feet away Fein people. 6 feet decent compromise brief encounters live walking part someonein store. Someone accepts reality people going die illnesses naturally arise humans control everything mother nature throws us? Yea sure I’ll happily one those. Enjoy living fairy world there’s disease disaster. Yea, I’m sure there’s going scheming going mail loses bunch ballots certain areas such. election going sham, there’s way trump goons cheat. coin would give fellow Redditor. like ""protesters"". (brief) article say. say survivors immune response one protein, whereas died apparently mounted immune response different protein. separated — age sex. doesn’t say anymore patients.

Massively f response address disastrous blowback saying “we can’t withstand redo kind, much less better one first f’d-up one”. Thank info. question hypothetical, never large group wanted know best time get tested would something come up. 

Sorry situation though, hope guys getting better days go on. Best luck Kinda point just... stopped caring. gone long I'm tired. wear mask I'm told too. Basically bare minimum that's it. Need practice social distancing wear mask! stop wearing N95 switch cloth mask. N95 one way valve type mask. save catching virus, infected, continuing spew virus everybody vicinity. think important thing realize ""parties indoor dining"", ""my party"" ""my night out"". mentality ""it big deal bunch friends over, everyone else isn't"" ×100,000. Pretty soon nobody acting like assume everyone else is. Like reverse bystander effect. don’t blame knowing this, prone position one treatments used severe COVID patients.

I first noticed deployed Italy’s darkest days, practice spread along virus.

I encourage look yourself, links save moment. Look podcast. He's Jr variety science denying idiots. He's one them. past,America ensued rationing enormous draft genuine domestic hardships. Today half people even wear mask go bars. Lol. Calm bro. joking. cry it. weirdo.

Thanks agreeing me, though. I'm glad finally figured out. Americans bought fable rugged self-reliance, regard attempt raise collective standard living personal attack. also view compassion empathy forms weakness. even believe preserving relative status depends keeping others down. American, feel slightly responsible spillover mentality 😔 I'm sure eager go back post history - advocated herd immunity strategy order save high risk back March. knew long term symptoms middle risk populations, realizing comprehensive strategy protect risk.

However - save lives. never comfortable guaranteed sacrifice lives comfort others. Economies recover. Lives lost cannot. this, we'll agree disagree. Africa already struggling. Allowing virus potentially high permanent morbidity spread world order save idea well thought strategy. illegal organize. illegal action employer obstruct organizing. course, companies like Walmart close stores start organizing. Lots brainwashing unions management union hold managers accountable contract labor laws. would big fat American state &lt;4% positivity rate, trust federal government low trust state local government. I’m afraid whatever tell me, isn’t true. following science. 

We don’t go much do, try one person leaves time order eliminate need child go public. It’s hard trying focus health grateful good health everything need. 

I know vast majority Americans don’t care think actions won’t affect me. control myself.  Strip club regulations strict WA, everyone goes Portland fix Russians discord boner intensifying!!!! Brace Trump/GOP/Russia creates division beyond Cold War levels Sigh..... article talks nothing herd immunity anything 20%. 

Later, dude outbreaks tied protests see rises cases outbreaks. strong indicator going get outdoor events completely safe. Yes really inhumane thing guy's tone.

Not couple hundred thousand entirely avoidable deaths. airplanes though? That's me. Exactly.

I want see effects people.
I trust Trump sponsored vaccines. Trump office popular vote.

Not exactly, get popular vote. got 3-4 million votes less Hillary. complicated system US has.

(But even 49% vote says something country. Mike Ehrmentraut weeps. quarantining well according contact tracing course took, prolonged exposure someone positive live I’m feeling anger too...never disappointed people generally believe humans suck anyway. I’m never going forgive people they’ve behaved actual damn pandemic. I’m getting depressed seeing people fun living life I’m sitting home trying safe wait out. Like life frozen them. Sounds stupid type thing seeing people’s stories made want vent second. Speaking nuts..re-read pathetic orange rage driven nonsense again, pretend adult. Regarding handwringing self loathing required see articles bullshit, apply common sense. 
Compare EU wide US dont feel like using simpler method, per100k.
EU testing rates vary 30-70 per 100 vs US testing rates 170per 100k. 
The 14 day cumulative average for.new cases US around 16 per 100k. (Johns Hopkins). EU wide ranges 10 countries 10 per 100k 14 countries 20per 100k. (European Centre Disease Prevention Control)
Don't get triggered bullshit, look data take bait stop pretending people support obviously see opposition party ""conspiracy nut"" ""anti-science"". said people approve ""protesting"" densely packed groups shouting rioting mobs It’s similar Greek myth Cassandra lot - see things going horribly wrong making sense people around don’t believe it. America: nation idiots, idiots, idiots. Embarrassed maybe? Canadian say Quebec Florida Canada. shit embarrassing. You’re wrong it’s work culture + workload thing. days beginning COVID I’d go 14 hrs without eating drinking water. I’d come home crash. really really fucking awful I’m glad we’re past stage here. would lose shit eating desk. “make make sense” rhetorical, damn good answer. Thanks. mean, can. Staying home option. option I've chosen, too. get groceries delivered. order meals local restaurants delivery, too. go drive pharmacy get medicine month (with mask on). week, work 8-5 home. Otherwise, play cats, clean home, watch hockey baseball, talk husband, play video games. miss family, otherwise I'm pretty happy stay home life now.

Plus I'm way less stressed risk getting covid, would likely affect pretty seriously.

What part life makes idiot? Make Canada French Again! Curbside pickup. 

No one posting, ""I went inside Walmart, everyone wore masks properly, great!""  Sure. lot violent crimes two well.  American ashamed couldn’t better protect people keep getting evicted fucking pandemic! ‘leader’ doesn’t care us.  posts title unfortunately rhetorical question :-( literally way get lower numbers idiot-fucks &amp; karens. rest world calls plague, calling IQ raiser. Trump lost 3 million votes studies show long Covid-19 lasts aluminum surfaces? see studies 2000 Coronavirus strain shows 2-8 hours staying power aluminum, none specific strain. wonder since drink cans drank yesterday packaged 7-21-20, forgot sanitize them. Given packaged 7-21-20 OK necessarily panicking it'd good peace mind well future reference. Trump isnt problen. regular people like fucking country favorite schools saying possible ask teenagers wear masks.

They've problems ever bullying girls spaghetti straps skirts inch short. masks different for... reasons? forgot include estimates herd immunity would make impossible anywhere close 100% population become infected. Early cdc estimates based Rø ~2.5 put herd immunity threshold around 60-70%. That, however, likely doesn’t paint whole picture recent paper found 40 60% unexposed people cells responsive novel coronavirus, likely resulting previous exposure betacoronaviruses. puts threshold herd immunity far lower that, Rø starting substantially decrease approach threshold herd immunity. money left make difference. media done favors many times they've reported outright wrong things, like reported masks unconfirmed effective prevent Covid transmission, said airborne. People tend believe first thing read, people believe masks necessary Covid spread surfaces.

The media complicit issues we're seeing now. skepticism given pharmaceuticals. Whatever vaccines end approved, go clinical trials medication. one trial design looked randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded, sample size 30,000 patients. study finds vaccine safe effective, see reason skeptical. think way break cycle people die?!?!

These people born stupid, like said brought probably stupid people, cycle continues, ways break cycles help people, starts social safety nets like Scandinavia.

&amp;#x200B;

These kinds people bad, want suffer. feel bad victims. Judas pretty good song 3. Vaccines effective, people go back normal life roll dice. small significant portion population becomes shut-ins. Pepperidge farm remembers. That's point - say science, not. Rather, appeal authority. 

But problem is, particular authority (the Trump admin) well trusted many bad record things.  covid crisis created opportunity people blame. What's point comment? raise anxiety? blame President? suggestions? 

Here're suggestions, since seem offering cause alarm. Use HCQ widely, appropriately, vulnerable populations. Audit hospital records over-counting Covid deaths, apportion actual causes truthful facts. release prison populations, they're population least likely act responsibly epidemic. Recognize many illnesses already accepted normal part life. Take legal action Chinese govt misleading world disease. Here’s lesson Vietnam, country 99 days without cases, dozens per day: don’t open country, stay alert time. 2nd wave hit harder. You’re assuming they’re wrong? mean fuck georgia sure, isn’t good thing? rooting 98 cases say told so? USA? I’m American, covid started spreading august actual strain first found Sichuan 2013 *COVID-19 rubbing hands:* ""Back business"".  half get healthy half get die choice.

Fuck em. Yes rips paper like communist. she’s WOMAN! Can’t see danger we’re in!?!? Yep people well aware covid determined ignore show church, wear masks, keep enough distance people, difficult much sympathy them. Especially since undoubtedly proceed transmit people there. 

You know. everyone sucked buckled first month, mixed messages outright denials covid real, proper testing mandated measures promptly put place get go, control now.

The US could one leading countries successfully managing virus. Yeah I'm fan GOP, guy's comment stupid shit. know plenty Republicans hate Trump voting Biden year. Republicans problem. GOP leadership brainwashing issue. 

Saying ""they're still Republicans"" needlessly antagonistic group people genuinely trying improve country world spending TON money anti-trump ads Holy fuck literally Hitler truth danger remind of. Mass generalizing either individuals can't possibly prove statement like media showing worst us news. 

You speak anyone else. Speak yourself. Americans, especially NY'ers taking seriously, since day 1. leadership get grip since day 1 megalomaniac interested narcissistic agenda anything else. 

Unfortunately leader makes false statements, disagrees science experts, people idiotically side him. Why? news facts anymore. ratings left vs right. joke. sides ashamed themselves. 

Our leader dividing us two camps. Left vs right. positions, like person's statement above, Democrat's bad vs hero Republicans. saying Americans care. flat wrong. 

Americans care. care deeply. take freedoms granted. need eradicate fake news strange anti science agenda plaguing country long time. 

We need get rid sociopathic leader need year. 

Some people hoodwinked appealing religious beliefs one example. wish religious leaders would stand teach flock science devil's work. humanity used free given good.

It seems like many (not all) religious people zero faith mankind. God going stop virus. believe God, believe given us need good well. big deal. comparisons world wars stupid. I’m glad see you’re resorting ad hominem arguments. occurs can’t back argument.

The US Italy could reasonably went lockdown without Chinese influence. this, need form evidence show CCP influences decision. Remember, is.

 2020 dead us. game plan save 2021 still chance. bit undeveloped spooge human. Shutup. China can't provide people. treats like shit, look Uighur situation. to. could've tested lot more. Better contact tracing. Fund available antibody testing. Mandated masks. know, reasonable shit scientists public health officials tell us works. 

Instead, we're cutting funding testing trying reopen schools business usual (cuz fuck teachers staff students live vulnerable populations).

The rest developed world save UK laughing us. HDQ. saw system bend president's rather science. 

That's point. Sorry, mean imply right take land, understand mentality nationalism people ruining sarcastic joke facts. Social outrage everything else lot complicated adjusting numbers. compare e.g. renting cost back nowadays, absolute numbers adjusted inflation tell far less, using % income spent rent. workhours needed pay student debt.

For example Vietnam war, lot less Americans died, yet outrage bigger. Iraq war, 5000 soldiers died, tiny comparison WW2 (Okinawa alone 14.000 dead), yet grief scale accordingly. 9/11 3000 people. research published yet, think, found article Forbes you! got links might get started. ""It is."" weiner almost 8 inches long tell chicks dudes. would mental acuity know take care recognize danger. look older haven’t figured many organ donations made motorcycle riders. one old (March), there's really damning dem ad too: one cut 30 seconds went TV. need food water survive

Allow introduce allowed bring filters sorry  seem particularly upset US, look reason justify it.

The death toll WWII estimated around 70 **million** people, 291,557 US casualties cited represent rather small fraction that, 0.42% story French give USSR credit, French publication blames Hollywood French ignorance?

Way [miss yet still get angry somebody puts US casualties context *massive* total loss lifes WWII resulted mistweet ambassadors staff?

A ""mistweet"" that's quite representative lot Americans education mindset WWII, regularly actually rather dismissive total scale particularly sacrifices made Eastern Europeans end it.

I mean look whole interaction: merely pointed US casualties small fraction total loss lives WWII, absolutely factual, trying kind argument that's supposedly ""dismissive"". important point consider. Newsweek mention all. know people days read past headlines think rationally kind sensationalism irresponsibly fear-inducing. worth remembering studies measure effective mask protecting ""others"" instead wearer.

To protect wearer, really need N95 equivalent masks (kn95 pff2). studies showed, wrap panty hose top surgical masks better seal. First ""wE'Re TOgetHer""

Now take pictures report neighbor.

Wear masks, get tattoo, board train.

You fucking sheep. never hit herd immunity remember back March virus came Brazil, expecting Bolsonaro something, kept silent. media asked everyone get inside wear masks etc., did. 

After like week isolation, billionaires started posting videos saying something among lines:

- virus going kill 1% population! need get back work!
- can't let 5 thousand - 7 thousand deaths stop economy!
- Yeah, virus bad I'm sorry dead, somebody think economy!

We pissed elite right reasons. President still silent kept isolated. 

Then appeared national TV ordered everyone get back work ""little cold"", bad, he's athlete, even gets virus, nothing going happen. isolate elderly sick get back work. media lying you. 

My state's govt. aligned Bolsonaro, like city's mayor. city quarantine all, save two weeks Bolsonaro silent. Right now, hear cars passing by, people celebrating Father's Day, restaurants full people... 

It seems people think 100 thousand people statistic. long hit personally, matter. help Bolsonaro developed mild version virus (if even got infected first place) claiming saved hydroxicloroquine. guy asshole every single time appears public holding box cloroquine. 

TL;DR: Covid-19 Brazil class issue. Yeah hard reach high numbers disingenuous reporting standards upvote. partially agree you. care, I'm well. mental/emotional faculties taking toll. younger daughter video therapy anxiety acquired this. glad hometown represented well! Albuquerque, scheduled 50th annual Balloon Fiesta year. Balloon Fiesta big deal us. People travel world participate. probably thing we're famous (except *Breaking Bad* Bugs Bunny). going special one; 50 years!

 Balloon Fiesta lot fun. go watch lift dawn, go Balloon Glow evening. get see hundreds balloons flying city every morning week. course pretty important local economy.

It canceled year. Why? actually competent leadership. sucks, course, right thing do. I'll miss year, much would miss friends loved ones died. That's death toll end November. point lucky we're even first wave COVID end year America. fine me, ill first line guinea pig it. 1/1000 every 8 months like 1/10 80 years UK is... slightly dumber USA! 

God save Queen? stoppable. months avoid incoming surge. I'm approx 193 cm (6' 3"") flying horrible. Mostly narrow seats are. It’s gonna shit show locals too, won’t worry treating 250k bikers kind point. isn’t simple “masks help, wear them”.

We need know *how much* help order (for example) a) know stop wearing b) know bad outbreak mandated c) know mitigations help more/less masks correct mitigations chosen relative relative cost/burden.

Should places low steadily falling cases mandate masks now, mandated trend reverses? Arguing Mississippi wear masks easy New York? Canada? New Zealand? study say asymptomatic spread common symptomatic spread. found viral loads similar without symptoms. statement never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) rarely infect others. 'screw up' asymptomatic pre-symptomatic, reported clearly. 

This study found similar viral loads across groups (symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic) still advisable isolate everyone tests positive. point say otherwise. statement came data reported contact tracing measures member countries. study challenge concluded all. Furthermore, another study posted weeks ago confirmed said. used work major bank US, *total amount* time given great (2 weeks plus personal days/floating holidays course regular holidays, certain number years got bumped 3 weeks), *required* take 5 consecutive business days per year, exceptions. internal controls reasons make sure anything fishy, still something always looked forward to. Oh god, shut fuck up. Stop saying everything disagree real absolute fucking smooth brain. hysteria dying. That’s real story. Yea last four months they’ve fine. second wave expected. U.S. still fking first never ended it! Smoke contributes higher levels pm2.5. nothing all. hope everyone realizes Bill Gates twice rich 20 years ago started ""giving"" away money. whole Gates Foundation tax dodge lets grow Microsoft stock wealth without paying government. Imagine charity makes way money every year spends. Everything spends gets charitable expense gets keep money started ""charity."" Warren Buffett fool, put money Gates ""charity"" well. share grown well. brilliant. Must nice rich enough pay taxes. side benefit everyone thinks saint running ""charity.""   South Dakota good hospital infrastructure? mean locals go larger city care may already overwhelmed? comes Flanders dad. lousy beatnik family Iowa. I'm seeing pictures year. Groups people bar, sitting around campfires, hugging none wearing mask. I've wearing one since early April. sucks look group selfies gives creeps.  term format propagandized headlines? 

Who quoting? care random person thinks topic? don’t heart attack medical problems next year you’ll good. virus gonna around long time there’s cure found certain individuals can’t comprehend severity situation present point time. Yes. order FDA even approve EUA, FDA must come consensus treatments [the known potential benefits outweigh known potential risks even 2021? Whatever, I'll set reminder post r/agedlikewine We're past Easter 2021 already? Curbside pickup. Lockdown there's vaccine. Except medical personnel get exposed treating idiots also die damn, pretty different Seattle. surprised governor mandated masks, seemed like 90% people already wearing masks, guess getting control Central Washington. plus noticing people taking things seriously got town ways work. Ah, that’s say now. (And knows random truly representational sample was.) 

Even so: vaccine out, first go first responders (including whoever’s giving shot), doctors, nurses, EMTs, etc. people risk / vulnerable. plenty data pouring in. 

And fact plenty folks ***will*** want still wait turn ... think rest come around. Especially given much sick Covid we’ll already sick 😜 primary observation astonishing differently states responding pandemic clear responses working. Masks make difference!!! go school Massachusetts right outside Boston EVERYONE where’s mask EVERYWHERE including outdoors. rarely see someone without mask on. wear mask jogging biking outside everyone else children spectators little league baseball games even on. family connecticut way (with exception beaches, people seem think COVID won’t touch beach). anyways, states northeast lowest reported infection rates deaths...so again, masks clearly helping stop spread!! baffles states look northeast see results required mask wearing, still choose enforce it!!! many conservative talking point virus shot past months believe current one designed address number. Basically goes something like claiming number dead inflated includes deaths caused causes attributed virus. Nonsense like politically motivated virus opposition current ""throw wall see sticks"" talking point. 

It's exhausting see point point shot discredited conservative Republicans US simply turn yet another easily debunked position. believed reason, logic science less selfishly ignorant. Thats got? Stop making politics. Many right-wing governments (USA) failing coronavirus, left-wing governments (Spain). Many right-wing governments relatively well (Australia), left-wing governments (NZ). moved 17. mother degenerate gambler. never knew father mother. dropped highschool help pay bills. Unknowingly funding mother's gambling addiction. Moving best thing ever did. got g.e.d. 19. lived friend family went college paid two year trade program. I'm making good money trade regret nothing. People harder tighter little cry baby, matter, leading in. Stereotyping cool test administering, unlikely. again, frequently needed developed nations. I’m saying cause want opt out? put cap it? I’m sorry someone doesn’t feel safe anymore environment able opt given moment matter circumstances. 2021. Soon failed state, agree. largely huge divide rural vs. urban politics. China problem, instance, real democracy lol. 😂 It’s probably Watership Down. Heyyyyoohhhhh! Yup, without vaccine everyone going get eventually thinking makes lot sense. closer vaccine people thought would point yea long term planning short sighted. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* would nice hospitals could throw EMTALA window refuse treat anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. Think hoax? Overblown? Liberal conspiracy? remdesivir you. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* bizarre justification many levels. Tell next time there's terrorist incident. Verdict decided yet. We'll see! Thanks much US reached 5,000,000 cases. mortality rate soooooo low, that's ""only"" estimated 75,000 deaths. top 170,000 already dead.

Are winning, yet? No, don’t. Like Brazil. People allowed generalize, problem think everyones stupid literally think 100% people same. Nobody besides complete morons. troubling part GOPs strategy convince everyone government bad ineffective. course accomplish amazingly well convince new generation voters cynical towards government.

Not more
I appalled total selfishness fellow citizens I'm sure Pareto Principle *disagrees* that. suggests 80% wealth generally owned 20% people. that's good effective thing result good portion suffering hardships. 1.I'm furthest thing progressive
2.I love associate article homeless guy brazenly violating law ""minorities"". Typical ""low expectation racist."" US like 50 different countries, one. problem national response all, every state left fend own. states good it, others haven’t. really depends part country live in, attitudes/intelligence level people are. I’d say U.S. ended way did. really need stop thinking one big country.

Trump legitimately sucks leader can’t imagine would much different president. Trying organize 50 states anything like herding cats. There’s sense unity anywhere. know.

The rich? powerful? Yes. grandparents? No. opposite. *They know.* can't comprehend much harder life now, ""still same"". Get job (through education), buy house, get married, kids, keep working get old enjoy left die. 

They realize become *basically impossible*, become unobtainable, question even worth it. removed perspective: ***it's not***. born generations advantages.

No, born generations *same difficulties less*. Every generation made easier easier 70's - workers wages stayed same, *everything* else started increasing. never subjected either ""just little bit harder"" already established lives. workers, drudge profitable extravagance.

And due extremities increasing every single *quarter* (no longer decades years), people getting fed-up it. Ah, simple minded left. ones willing shun people can't speak eloquently enough cause turn people around way thinking.

Shunning people symptom adult temper tantrum, lowlife move. Asshattery Yup, title really read 300K Confirmed tests. Excess deaths suggest much higher actual death toll. called 'the world wide web'. YES CARE! Canada Provincial leader nothing schools come opening September words “it’s gods hands now”. care. trumpy doesn't. know internet, right? privilege choice, yes, makes sense.

If privilege choice, entire thought moot.

Ignoring situation others live privilege situation lack understanding empathy. nothing kind thing. vaccine going extremely effective means everyone take we'll still rampant community spread. wait actually false? 405,000 us soldiers died WWII I'm confused  Even everything saying accurate, bunch employees layed they're sick quarantine makes economic recovery lot harder.

Masks + social distancing efforts way go. already amount. Many states counting deaths Covid. example, pneumonia deaths skyrocketed year. way information need considered? learn America give American response. 
I don’t care. opinion wrong. opinion right. 
Americans don’t care.  wearing hats either hide weapons pay us $1 free dress pass day wear problem measures put place, midlands country put lockdown-like footing due increase cases there; similar measure place flights.

And hey, nice job dodging point, lad. flu shot also helps lessen effects flu even perfect match strain flu circulating. Think like priming immune system. Non-essential. Shut down, Lock up. Simple. backwards. 

If trust trump administration trust vaccine, people trust Trump resistant. approved /int/ moderator President Plump did. US response par countries like Iran, Brazil, Mexico... shit show way prevent China contained it. /s actually forgot important part:

Never flush lid open late possible (just leaving).

Flushing huge source aerosols don’t trade lives.  right. Thank informing me! that's editorializing _want_ tile -- author's. go first reply. sub rule post deleted. equivalent ""40% sick days taken Monday Friday"" Well use word perfect. 
By saying Chris Jerichos band fozzy played activist tattling fozzy .I mean fact use real name story ready shows us pathetic loser is. Kinda sad school district although hybrid distance learning. pay increase. go online, plan shitcan para-educators similar positions. Thats 1000 people fairly small community.

 classic economic literature.  sad true. want disappoint Daddy Putin. Ruining world 85 year olds isn’t solution. That's one dumbest things I've ever heard regarding Japanese people. American Japanese cultures vastly different. American culture extremely individualistic Japanese culture extremely collectivistic. pros cons different styles collectivistic cultures shine times like these. Yup majority football players big guys. fat others even mostly muscle already put lot workload hearts move mass, wise mess virus could put heart muscle risk. sucks people dicks, still everything that's within power protect yourself, regardless people think.

Tons people never move home state, take Disney trip Florida/California, trip Vegas, trip NYC Chicago St Louis something else state two sports event concert. however comfortable making fun country's stupidity. dislike guy. 291,557 number comes combat deaths published total 405,399 US soldiers died WW II. difference accounted deaths combat zone due enemy action. What's tens thousands known killed, remains never found tens thousands MIA. WW II gigantic catastrophe world got light considering 16 million uniform. USSR thought lost 20 million, mostly civilians. Yup, board infected people apartments disease dies out. Uhh... line discussion started comment “selling out”. Seriously, don’t anything else do? Plenty maskless mouthbreathers end asymptomatic hospitalize kill others, perpetuate spread virus can't get control Suppose COVID-19 completely stopped spreading right now. many deaths think US would see already infected, would see last death? 

We way knowing many people actually infected moment even idea fatality rate, tough say. 

As last death, probably early November, correct? cares flu. Flu sucks enough wearing mask would stop getting would wear mask. disputing notion myocarditis = swelling. inflammation myocarditis inherently tissue damaging process, tissue heals before. inflammatory process literally kills heart cells (apoptosis).

When someone “recovered” myocarditis normal heart function again, heart before, increased risk forever. one country handle badly. let's testing Canada vs US


Total testing


US - 195,462 per million

Canada - 116,580 per million

How deaths per million


US - 499 per million

Canada - 238 per testing started dropping hurricane. don’t expect back near levels previously. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* specific county USA shows 1.13k cases per 100k. that's true still rough times ahead? big break new cases 4 weeks ago hump curve starting go down. It’s exhausting days literally everything calculation much risk you’re willing accept, make acceptable trade offs risk strike balance safe going absolutely insane. Overall seems like risk public bathrooms (especially rest stops along highway) relatively low you’re spending small amount time there, really shouldn’t crowded (unless you’re fucking stupid mega rally middle pandemic). think it’s lower risk eating indoors restaurant, don’t know we’ve seen data support that. 

Personally I’m trying really hard judge people may choosing travel right now. It’s hard know precautions might taking aren’t visible pictures post Facebook, whether they’re eating restaurants bars getting takeout, they’re wearing masks every opportunity. companies don’t care anyone money. sorry appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* hid, wants 'e' overrune wonder I'm going blow time big players (companies) Illinois? early determine anything conclusive line, remaining precautions reasonable. viruses detrimental effects individual decade line, like Polio's shingles. entire sub full pussies Right, controlled situation.

1. Wear mask.
2. Open door paper towel.
3. business.
4. Flush foot.
5. Probably skip hand-washing, actually.
6. Open door new paper towel.
7. Use hand-sanitizer outside.

Is 100% guaranteed? No. like 99.999999999% guaranteed? Probably.

Unfortunately, really work women well. :( /r/conspiracy ethnocide Uighurs right

What numbers, compare muslims killed America? seems working well around world.....hahahahaha...it's good.... [Dr. Stella Post-pandemic, widespread federal public works program really chance restoring country. That's basically military turned fun possibility shipped fallujah 18 years old. two thirds us take hope best. 
 
""it is"" crowd fend themselves. Yup. already thought people hand, really solidifies big issue be. government, people themselves, complete rot empathy. 

Unfortunately, really see someone taught empathy adult. love community, shit hits fan, good place be. want fucking lovable, average disgusting little creatures moron said higher thread tons upvotes. one could predicted this. Wait hear 650,000 Americans die heart disease YEAR! WW2 NOTHING! disabled Facebook page couple months ago.  reason every person friends list knew someone died. way depressing look at.  help people friends list concentrated New York, Florida, Pennsylvania New Jersey. live florida. great place lots great people. hard times Haha!!! Stop!!! We’ve read it! Nah. school kids spreaders. They’ll take home families. families take work. That's sub can.

Positive news forbidden. trump figured way fuck hard enough overcome modern medical science completely yet.

But he's certainly trying hardest. Incoming: 

tired old jokes USA number one. saw pic Mike Parson, came see someone shared quote sending kids back school. Glad did. 

His ‘Oh well, do?’ attitude infuriating deadly. live rural Missouri you’d better believe I’m glad it’s election year.  I’ll glad see fella thrown out. Couldn’t stand Greitens, couldn’t done worse dumbass replacement. People cling sorts nonsensical delusions order maintain grip 'normalcy'. Even normalcy gone. Think dude eating steak Matrix. knew real, care. that's people. still republican supporters there. needs terrorists trump? Why? part process shortened feel necessary show safety? far I’m aware still phase 3 clinical trials whstnot different strokes different folks...how article titles determined? that's editorializing well...by author. care. choice. mask time me. see reason care care. Remember guy represents typical republican, folks ^ 

Remember November. Republican Party terrorist organization. They’ve destroying country half century. horrible actually around 407,000 Americans died world war two Pacific theater war. fEAr pOrN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! implying treat coronavirus like 9/11 holocaust?

And treat coronavirus victims attention honor treat people died trying stop Hitler taking Europe, continue die every day stopping horrible oppressive warlords Middle East? predicted 5 million February ""Do not, don’t give damn too.. NY Cali put covid patients right nursing homes CMS guidelines! Geez!!! Florida didn’t that!! 

You're cherry picking trying draw equivalency none exists. NY Cali followed federal guidelines nursing home patients. actually UNCLEAR patients caused spread stable (and less contagious) moved. thought nursing home workers actually brought infections...which cases, nursing homes proper procedure place.

With NYC, completely gloss fact Cuomo reversed decision went Federal guidelines moment outbreak occurred. completely gloss incredibly quickly NYC turned pandemic hotspot area steady decline new cases deaths.

Meanwhile...Florida? Really?? That's baseline? Seriously. state completely ICUs people dying homes streets...that's shining example?  Florida case complete utter neglect. Therefore...false equivalency. 

You zero care issues ACTUALLY concerned badmouthing Democrats...so yea, shame you. complete hypocrite, possibly troll, either way I'm done ya Hopefully people continue careful vaccine distributed soon. clearly willing die hill bad math. CDC say use CFR pandemic numbers dont reflect actual risk death. CFR used END. US thick it. Measuring Risk getting Corona measured IFR during. done, look back get better CFR. Countries control tail end CFR 1% matches IFR 1%. During, calculate risk death IFR. After, calculate CFR. vaccines work way? Start somewhat effective enough manage rate severity infection time manage make rogue case then? Still think Mr. Gates bit optimistic say effectively eliminated wealthier areas end 2021 though think manageable enough level productivity without significant fear. ""Where's Sharpie?"" primary danger going older people spread to

But also they're drinking smoking, they're making susceptible complications  cover least half population usa? saying since kids get sick adults, means also able transmit virus people? that's viruses work. trying kill us families save money. Well, COVID kill 100%, way 100% people goes beach drown, still lifeguards. Well current covid vaccine candidates need pass 3 phase clinical trials get FDA approval. covid vaccine won’t go market without FDA approval. He's releasing new album soon. actually result American vegan terrorists. Specifically band Cattle Decapitation. released latest album black Friday last year, called Death Atlas. preceeded single 'Bring back plague'. There's fun quarantine video YouTube. cancelled European tour April. tour called 'Euro-pandemic'. know did... “33 billion dollar study reveals shocking turn events; children may spreading Covid-19, 11!” spread across US gas 100% man mad. even moderately intelligent president population vast majority covid victims would alive. glad finally understand, getting close. 

Now let's cut sky-high military budget invest citizens. went one elite universities let tell you, rich people go purpose mingling others richer them. one them, quickly catch leave cliques. cannot join either month Bali summer break, etc....it difficult make friends certain circles. end, connections part bit restricted rich kid outset. Surely saying 47k death covid recoveries got hit buses.

There perfect method, perfect number country. Ignoring overtly critical, grain salt sufficient. Americans mostly won’t care they’re selfish self-absorbed... it’s painful acknowledge see...... it’s nice least see people care reddit.... I’m angry wrote that. :| oh USA....... ship sinking captain singing... Insaniacs!  work local public school friends work local University. night day difference school handling versus seriously University taking makes want cry. wish school even half much University regarding protecting everyone requiring people wear masks. brother moved FL March (from DE) try look what's going there. wish SOMEBODY would take responsibility enforce whatever necessary get control least barely manageable. Good luck stay safe.  Right, comparison ""heart disease vs WW2"" Cool thanks help That’s works, unfortunately. people want get sick, okay. also get people sick DON’T want get sick everything right. History judge moron wanted school administrators thrown prison capital offense charges simply opened school. say you? Maybe don’t force women children will? even realize said? 13 year old girl gets raped becomes pregnant “Maybe don’t get pregnant.” woman loving husband use condoms every day one day misfortune happens condom pinhole it. “Maybe don’t get pregnant.” used think humans survive diseases strong ones... later generations become stronger stronger...

then realized logic applied viruses... ones survive battles humans become stronger... they'll much lethal huams. image anyone great would risk COVID-19 watch them.

I seen parents since pandemic. risking health. band existence important folks.

Having said that, Fozzy OK. listen them. Prepandemic would gone see show. far aware still steps phase 3 clinical trials truly apathetic person reading would conclude nice narrative, great others awoken enough take care problem. Maybe he'll upvote comment. go back flamin' hot Cheetos.

Please convinced narrative forgot vote, convincing others allow continue apathetic. Maybe finish ""you one citizens!"" such. want emphasize war required americans storm multiple fortified beaches held fanatics. Like Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Normandy Ya compared normal New Individual positivity happening time around 18%. Here, read. Enough examples sceptical body product thats rushed havent tested years see body reacts Caring stuff is, like, *so* cliche “The world doesn’t give us credit tremendous job done! mean look numbers we’re testing! tell there’s comparison!”  Oh yeah really changes things. I've decided actually dig vaccines Someone slap face apparently probabilities [much flyby source read come 25%. According site, vaccines infectious disease 76.8% success rate phase 1 pass, 58.3% phase 2 pass, 75.3% phase 3 pass.

If look vaccines phase 3 (including ones combined trials), probability absolutely none 7 vaccines succeed 0.14%. one slap face would vaccine coronavirus never made before. Another slap face would vaccines China untrustworthy. Keep slapping face looks good true. Canada like many countries vastly outperforming America willing make self-sacrifices people. median age groups compared? like dealing projections. know 160K Americans died point anything happen tomorrow. 400k American soldiers died WW2, aren’t yet. Moderna Pfizer? I’m gonna say, think holocaust way worse coronavirus. comparing someone died fighting end it, probably given greater respect someone died disease. Canadian here. weeks, I'll flying States (which Yanks still allowing, stupid reason), marrying American girlfriend simplest ceremony possible (her neighbour happens judge), immediately whisking back across border, away diseased madness. (My province 15 million currently seeing fewer 100 positive cases daily, falling.) honestly feels like I'm planning high-risk mission behind enemy lines.

The USA always pretty weird place, virus lifted many thin veils normalcy country looks behaves like 19th-Century insane asylum point, we're looking forward watching November's election play safe distance.   population three times smaller telling people “missing point” pure gold. Almost golden nurse ignoring calf pain things. Also almost golden assumption pandemic access healthcare limited somehow. said works. heinous doesn’t mean don’t endorse it. Damn, brutal position in. Well, sake hope successful ""throwing everyone's hard work away"". Houston cops anything write ticket car chase. Yea can’t talk positives instead dead! That’s I’m saying know breakdown. sounds really reasonable, assuming someone monitoring make sure masks stay on. grandfather nursing home, chance he’d leave one alone. give money big corps day they’ll allow us jobs back truth we’re still first wave. far over. understand know answers right?

Ffs working speak. kid dude, primarily Fox News. basically them. They're filled lies, half-truths, misinterpretations. It’s bad, let’s also honest stats, people dying 70s/80s/90s crapload conditions many cases don’t many quality years left. isn’t young people died war. There's meta principle too:

**The enact principles** Hope real one all!! sub astounds every day. sense rationality reality.

Where start?

The loss young man 60+ years live average much tragic someone less 6 months left live already lived full life, majority coronavirus victims.

The population US today 330 million, vs 130 million WW2.

On average 8,500 people die day US roughly 250,000 people month. mentioned, majority coronavirus deaths life expectancy less 6 months. Think little.

Finally, reasonable predict second wave flu season based behavior respiratory viruses (the already circulating coronavirus strains particular). that, virus fade away public eye rate spread slow due increased widespread natural immunity. continue circulate, cold virus like circulating coronavirus strains, similar mortality morbidity rate viruses.

Most importantly, steps taken ""limit"" Coronavirus already killed people saved, continue orders magnitude greater next decade. concerned saving lives, attitude prevalent sub mind-numbingly misguided makes sick. financially ruin say ""for good"" lmao projected 291k looking reopen schools. Wtf?? believe majority medical professionals acting Good faith best knowledge available. don’t take medical advice politicians. agreement medial field what’s best I’ll take it. $$$ I'm asking curiosity here, possible virus could spread asymptomatic patients kills host?

In theory would possible. Take exact characteristics coronavirus individual inhales virus, point capable spreading it. Said individual goes life week feel anything. replace effects virus one 50% kill rate. 

I kinda think possible high spread high mortality virus, unlikely. Still though, entire existence unlikely.  someone shit flushed hours entered, eyes got full blast aerosolized badness.

Covid not. sure plenty restrooms good ventilation. sure plenty not. Sheriffs refusing uphold state law constitution?

Jesus fucking Christ. That's wrong, stupid, immoral, unjust can't fathom it. Oh universe, feel like died inside reading ignorance. know there's small chance? Even using one based preexisting vaccine, change enough could new side effects? 

I'm vaccines, wary one pushed fast. plans honestly idea 3 people excluded non-tested positives math. know people catch dont get tested.

Your math also excluding non-tested deaths.

Excess death numbers come out, guess what? 200k time period last year. Also: suicides down, car accident fatalities down.

There's LOT uncounted information sides.

That said, agree IFR important statistic, think close 1%, I'm nearly laissez-faire 1% are. please see response figures 1% looks. There, they’re Waiting see kind outbreak Sturgis Bike Week starts up. Idiots driving country certainly doesn't. also probably caused swine flu vaccine. Fauci's goal minimize number deaths Covid. goal get back normal life gatherings economic prosperity. vaccine accomplish latter. Lol fucking moron.

""Pass buck"" literally exactly Obama president almost entire term. Trump replenished PPE past 3 years? sure time golf!

But yes, lets blame Obama using executive orders, republicans constantly WHINED LIKE LITTLE DIPSHITS using, despite fact **OBAMA ISSUED FEWER EXECUTIVE ORDERS PER-TERM AVERAGE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT 139 YEARS**. read right. well century, republicans issued fewer EO's Obama ones served 1 term therefore enough time more. Yet fucking losers religion around pretending Obama practically invented EO.

But yes, lets blame Obama, president 3 years now, issuing executive orders Republicans whined about, order overturn psychotic, evil, endless assault funding social safety nets systems like PPE.

But ""passing buck"" fucking lunatic. Given managed supply 40 million disposable masks Timmy’s don’t get can’t get steady supply disposables. 

I mean use cloth masks (I freebies government husband prefers those) use wash every day. many cloth masks - filter mediums - switch new ones use even can’t wash right away. think kids - parents - going wash masks everyday even every second day?

There also already groups protesting new mask mandate steal childhood suffocate nonsense. 🙄 sister thinks Anthony Fauci Hillary Clinton released virus. Yea like three year old hits sister says “my arm it.” Yeah kind strange headline considering that. Many stats thrown around past months, far anything I've seen, may want find reliable sources spreading misinformation pandemic. problem. Winter coming, lot us bit Arya us right now.  hard get NYC train, bus, car, plane, bike, walking. New Zealand like Hawaii. pretty damn isolated (except Hawaii issues now). aren’t making bad predictions bad inputs. state, model accurate within 10%. I’m sorry problem data, “it is”. Texas one states constitutionally required balance budget. good general theory, convoluted general practice leads short term thinking.

They're already suffering fallout Hurricane Harvey. Coronavirus + falling oil adds that. trumpvirus STD. shoot lol what's hard understand guns need guns too. They're fucking inbred shoot straight anyway Ayatollah Rock ‘Rona. Haha, no. 1/3 country follows president, even drove cliff, surprise anyone. I've seen several articles today.

&amp;#x200B;

once diagnosed positive, 

the thing matters who, where. cancer go work support family, like uncle. 

Your argument simplistic. Many American cannot “stay home”. 

He cannot stay home family doesn’t eat. interact people don’t wear masks conspiracy theorists think right “liberty” important right life. 

But state implemented rule can’t leave home. mandatory masks. Beaches open. don’t understand argument. Long haul self quarantiner - WEAR GODDAMN MASK FUCKING BABIES! quarantine since March I'm high risk (multiple reasons). Get yourselves, wear damn things get back normal life. I've worn mask 12 - 15 hours day without taking (work animal health), asthma....if it, you.

It's human right issue - that's Black Lives Matter is, human rights issue. Wearing mask decent, selfless thing help others (and yourself). anything rights, medical safety issue. PUT GROWN UNDIES, QUIT BITCHING WEAR FUCKING MASK! True, bonus could they’ve already recovered tho. wouldn’t ask, heard NPR fancy pants people selecting people that've already least substantially smaller bank balances (if they're incapable new outlook). lmfao imagine blaming nonmaskers We've Tried Nothing

That “nothing” caused highest rates unemployment since Great Depression, setting record deficits ($3 trillion - ) saddling grandchildren unfathomable debt, 40 million Americans might become homeless year’s end: expensive “nothing” tried. zero effect what-so-ever would kind preferred hadn’t murdered economy shutting businesses.

I take want double go mass starvation event? notes.

Weekends typically large drop, due reduced testing lab processing, drop significant compared weekly high.

Shimane prefecture, small prefecture 200,000, never reported couple cases one day, reported cluster 91 cases high school dormitory.

Okinawa announced record high 159 cases small island, right start 'Obon' holiday travel season. Okinawa popular destination travelers. know planet fucked Japan starts protesting - ever protested anything? friends family quickly learned offer solutions complaints. repeatedly complain better tried fix you’ll get sympathy me. course exceptions, everything fixed - sure try. wish knew many big problems we’re facing year. vote, wear mask, always tried racist. I’m speak try guide around - like reasoning toddlers herding cats, nearly impossible.  


I’m considering shock bracelets everyone; Say something racist hateful? That’s gonna hurt. Refuse wear mask? That’s gonna hurt put get 18 feet next person. Lie public selfish gain? That’s gonna leave scorch march ground! 

If only... sigh. Rip sister dumb isn’t raw computing power meat computer. People people comes that. Let’s get racist comparing race’s brains work better. done taboo look at.

Part stupid empathy others. better cooperate people. caring others stupid move. Cultures care everyone borders better better around us better. isn’t zero sum game. Dirty South, y'all really feel no, dont Good luck convincing people this. could study results showing 100% efficacy almost side effect profile people would still think shit gonna give autism. anti-science surrounding vaccines actually mind blowing. amount dunning Kruger effect... take learned (their mistakes well) apply it, look happened mock let happen you.  made list. AYATOLLAH CORONA Good move. time got around looking out. find ages. Next time see doctor ask start wearing mask yet lol. true 🌽 whole country’s hijacked rabid capitalists willing others die profits. Modern Robber barons ever were. Yep! That’s silver lining lol. [Maybe stopped voting them. tried praying omnipotent sky being? Surely let us suffer something terrible like drown everything funsies feel you. scary. problem we're *not* together. people still lockdown, social distancing, wearing masks carrying burden getting us this. rest country pretending like there's nothing going making worse longer lasting needs be. See someone know? Big hugs!  50% great! know flu vaccines less effectiveness rate? Yey. Half million. accelerating speed plaid. talking you. Make yo paper boo boo. 

They talking fuckers bar, restaurants, house parties, packed retail stores, etc. now. Wait till school starts. Yeah, shit? Kids going revive. You’re sarcastically saying it’s big deal. arguing actually big deal. [Celebration know difference Sweden Finland comes policies? closed primary schools, Sweden not. Please tell benefit closing primary schools point have. Yep plenty us care! problem ones much bigger impact ones do. fucking infuriating new? Used USA customs absurd worst compared anywhere else. sucks minority. Trump office popular vote.

Yes true, 62,000,000 eligible voters, voted Trump. freedom Dont tell do? Social distancing would near 100%. can't catch thing near thing. that's case 0 reason opening everything back up. Avoid people. agree statement large enough sample size also necessarily. 

Long term side effects won‘t visible well, long time. That‘s 10-15 years for. quite re-evaluation time phases, thus ensuring won‘t nasty side effects. Wait schools open in-class instruction. 

A lot naysayers family started wise grandma got it. She’s recovered thankfully. Sadly many cases doctors claimed done everything correctly still got it. Iirc somewhere Europe 40 year old nurse died recently known top cautious. It’s tough fighting invisible enemy unless shave every morning work even proper battery powered ppe mask built fans small chance breached. MUCH better disposable masks currently make MUCH expensive, realistic average consumers. asbestos removal company used work used top line masks range 1000$ that’s purchased 64 once. Yep. I'm believe vaccinations. mean I'll blindly get family poked. thatsthejoke.gif Good. I’m sorry came dick. Sneeze minor quote doctor saying “in present [political] climate it’s unstoppable” Congrats, better source time. But...

Iceland's IFR shit based pure guess basis.

UK's IFR solid basis probably close correct.

Don't even pretend quote China's data straight face. people screaming China hiding numbers January magically ""I like China's IFR I'm going pretend complaining numbers months ago"" party.

I actually never problem 1% death rate, think pretty accurate. like grade school, get points right, get points showing work, first link shit. second link *some* useful information.

Here's kicker, seem think 1% problem, whereas think HUGE problem. Left unchecked 1% means 2.3 million dead americans (assuming saturation point around 70% estimated herd immunity 1% 70%).

Let put Freedom units you: that's 776 9/11s, 577,500 Benghazis, 92 American Revolutions, 3.5 Civil Wars, 19.8 WW1's, 5.7 WW2's, 63.3 Korean Wars, 39.7 Vietnams, 1042 Afghanistans, 513.7 Iraqs.

1% problem. Grow watched ABC7 livestream protests San Jose, LA, Oakland, lots (probably around half) protesters wear masks. Taking consideration incubation time, 9 cases might even came gathering.

Anyways, else want do? Stop world? can't. Things must go on. Take precautions that's it. get probably days immune X amount time. 


It take us another 1/2 years reliable vaccination program stop crying 9 cases group people hardly suffer virus. Terrible news. God hate people. stupid Americans?! Somebody added support group republican governor candidate see posts pop up. literally they’re saying, damning democratic governor shutting us down. posts say it’s bad nothing help us beginning, also shutting us begin with? They’re exhausting party hatred. I'm surprise we're 5m. there's social distancing school probably taking social distance measures “I really don’t care. U?” Shoulda locked us out. Especially bunch profit companies trying “first,” We're still first wave yet countries exactly - locked much possible, burned virus, able open again. *every* country done that, would back normal months ago. Instead, politicization science science denial prolonged crisis far beyond needed be.

The prioritization could occurred March April. US failed utterly, controlling this, we're forced talk we're willing sacrifice. way. Wasn’t mostly democratic states practically murdered tens thousands elderly folks sending back nursing homes? Viral photos caused spread... It’s cowboy culture bs engrained us. It’s bad, really bad.  point going get believe past point kind mitigation. Alright. I'm done talking troll named kick_the_autistic. tried. Psh, shit effected anyone know. never wear mask hang groups day, zero social distancing. leads believe virus bad say numbers blown proportion. Change Ireland World colour orange. family member MD exactly this. incredibly mild cases April goes around talking even bad flu. wear mask still frequents large gatherings judt keeps talk COVID issue getting visited family Alabama. Full restaurants, people believing numbers overinflated, ""people die flu, too"" etc. take seriously hero white house doesn't? main concern Nascar ruined reputation forbidding Confederate flag... got me, I’m bot. Great catch!  surprising, no, reason may suspect. US run like countries, difficulty US COVID unsurprising, *predicted* way back February. mass ignorance malice. purely legal complexities fifty independent states unique jurisdictions, extension, CDCs fragmented power. 

Here's piece February law professor detailing this. fact matter country wide quarantines issued European countries simply worked watch wrestling passing, disappointing learn Chris Jericho ignorant he's always one truly nice people industry. Hard respect guy this. get qualifying hospital bill goes it, might change tune little. raging entitlement willful ignorance destroying country. utter unwillingness realize free healthcare possible, coronavirus real, masks aren’t safety key indicators coming implosion. foresee 10% people loudest complainers can't vaccine soon want it. actual death rate estimated .5-1%. Kinda annoys people theses subs can’t simple homework topic sub. u don’t like thT, here’s cdc saying essentially thing homework people. It’s hard. guys need follow /r/publicfreakout motorcycle would. gathering juggalos. like new experiences weird people, year Oh man. I've Garlic fest once. Hot July summer - saturated people smell garlic. once, think I'll volition. It’s weird comeback, too.

“Sure, state may suffering avoidable catastrophe due general incompetence ignorance elected officials voting populace, least didn’t marginal increase violent crime year year!” Stupid hipster Flanders mom. Remember flattened curve? believe American exceptionalism. Half country lied manipulated believing liberals made coronavirus make trump look bad think wearing masks communism Asians wear masks, needless say people horribly educated. rest us trapped inside people trying go back normal like nothing happening. Idiots exist everywhere every community. even medical doctors anti-mask wackos. small number, sure, exist. mean, kind did. state 10 million deaths entire country. OK. ban anyone who's unvaccinated shops, airplanes, public transport, schools gyms sake protecting everyone else. shelter home live like hermits / peepers wish. know American, hear another state city wearing masks surge cases, kind feel disgusted want badly avoid going there; encounter someone feel edge, never fully trusting them, wanting get close them?

That’s rest world feels us right now, country. Yes. summer ""easy"" part. winter horror show. Gene Krupa? house passed second bill months ago. Republicans sitting senate, absolutely nothing, pure political gamesmanship. maybe agent looked social media found anti-mask posts? get fucked, entitled animal sale analogy ... Us big stupid guy ... brain pass exams runaway Sithole.
We need US protect us. nuclear power know diplomacy 2 millennium now.

US wanted EU said fine, want go ... know exit. Exactly. I've pretty much lost hope global warming this. comfort I've got powerful people make huge change, hopefully powerful positions get taken smart people did, wasn’t making commentary good bad thought read mid-50s Faucis expectation. I'm pretty heavily concerned COVID even admit IFR pointing towards 1%.

I'm sorry, fighting rhetoric posturing, combat problem rhetoric posturing own. pretend CFR IFR scare people.

Want proof work? look effect Reefer Madness War Drugs Say campaign.

When tell people something going worst thing ever, turns bad, bad told them, become immune information.

Still believe me? Abstinence education leads teenage pregnancies comprehensive sex education. ""Having sex worst thing ever, get AIDS girls pregnant, AIDS baby three die"" fuck 1st, 2nd, 16th time nothing bad happens. Guess what? Try telling person ""hey, lying before, seriously, wear condom"". dice, lost lying caught.

Don't make ""War COVID"". Stick real numbers, scare numbers. Take real numbers explain real numbers HORRIBLE. expect lies tell story you.

1% Americans somewhere 2.31 million (1% 70%) 3.3 million (1% total population) dead.

That's atrocious. unconscionable people ignore potential 2.3 million dead. ignore facts? Well... first told 5% dead facts, everything proved wrong, CFR IFR. trying convince ""hey, we've lied once, believe us now"" wonder Sturgis thing, wonder Oklahoma rally thing (love Trump's interview said ""wasn't bad rally, happened one month later"" absolutely inclination bothered make connections there), wonder Florida thing.

You lost truth, tried spread fear, lost message.

1% looks like reality (CDC estimates .65% IFR). guess what? 1% fucking terrifying.

-

Stick facts. please complete motherfucking fool ignorantly tell health mother mother-in-law. Asshole. No. Can't shit people give fuck police enforce anything Please, please keep up, New York. Set example rest us. Honestly I’m impressed they’ve done this, gives flicker hope future Well, contest, I'm done *99.9%* human race.

Pretty sure 0.1% sub includes you.

Stay safe!

Edit: Well damn... Someone understand humor math. take back. definitely truth this, don’t forget also lot poor middle-income Americans make choice sending kids school (the parents) go work, keeping everyone home able pay basic necessities like food shelter. time employment many areas country already incredibly precarious. Stay home. absolutely can’t stay home, wear mask every part face breathe of. 


It’s fucking difficult. hope get coronavirus don’t recover. would better.  BS

Does California special branch USPS simply cannot handle delivering envelopes per household? realize ridiculous sounds. 

5 states done 100% mail-in years. Florida largely mail-in voting. PA 2 million mail-ins primary significant issues. That's disappointing hear given Chris Jericho one good guys wrestling biz. Certainly going respect guy given he's clearly alright spreading deadly virus. Yeah majority wear masks flu season Herd immunity apparently reached 85% since devastating R0 factor. Loving downvotes. It’s science science gets way real agenda. I'm glad think state good leadership. Army friend NM absolutely lost shit Balloon Fiesta cancelled. believe disease serious, believes closures shutdowns unnecessary. fully admit reason still social media watch events unfold NM lens schadenfreude. might case sometimes I'm sure difficult single parent really choice. would tough situation. I've never situation know. Stupidly transmitted disease Panties would interesting pic.
Funny, don’t remember CDC recommending them. forget Kyler Mikayla chugging white claws partying us death. Except manifestation communism ever looked like scale country. greatest concern potential loss scripted male soap opera ""Match"", probably crawl mom's basement open fuckin' eyes.  good thing.

But happening: (“New Postmaster General Overhauls USPS Leadership”) much care ensuring profits ever feel like crisis going end origin story societal supervillain? mean already picture montage head. Right. Big difference going bike trip people, stupid things like attending large rallies or, know, opening schools pandemic. crazy. People buy tin foil hats masks. 

Maybe sell tin foil masks keep government away mouth nose? I'll honest though, I'm Manhattan one thing I've constantly see parents kids, parents wearing masks kids. Like lady, know kids spread literally everything everyone too. don‘t know anything look swine flu vaccine got administered Germany. Apparently Long term side effects. Judas! Pfff, rich people ain't sending kids public school. C'mon son. No, real danger people actually getting virus system. aren’t contagious, living dormant virus periodically decides attack body means long lasting health issues potential storm responses body absolutely kill you. need prevent many people possible contracting it. Duhhhhhhhhhhhh ok sane. money one power cares you. short term capital gains. Especially administration. 


Here another little thing. Scientist arent god. dont answers. thinks safe knows. knows virus next 6 months year. Science set stone isn't. dozens county's stopped virus . do???? Better lot things could doing. Less harmful drugs tends keep people relaxed, contented, staying amusing art, TV, music, etc. ideal pandemic. say world, don’t say Ireland. ""gotcha"", I'm calling false information defensive offering counter-argument it. Maybe obtuse, treated like child. Who's going enforce it, Trump? someone he's appointed? governor state level cronies also rabidly pro Trump? Bracing? Lol. live Ohio people ever yelling it’s fake, it’s over, masks useless, etc. like funeral homes bracing influx business. I’m really sorry. parents COPD mom several heart attacks. feel worry. hope mother father get without catching see sense things get worse. way keeping mine (mostly) safe basically drive nuts constantly insisting begging, there’s much short sitting them. hope get okay. sounds like you’re everything can. Fortunately us US, terms vaccine blindly trust Trump since countries own, independent review boards check order see vaccine touted trump actually happens effective safe articles like that? true outdoor spread much less likely indoor, seen scientific really even journalistic articles saying ""blm protests slowed pandemic"". epoch times, funded state department

Hold on, what? thought Epoch Times run Falun Gong. relationship State Department? Lmao vaccine need 100% effective, needs effective enough make R&lt;1.0 Remember Obama Ebola? remember people 'well, flu kills people too!' that. really incredible frankly, internet distorting reality now. wear mask, god can't see pious are. Maybe stop voting property tax levy... joking? kids love ECMO! Remember year Tickle ECMO hottest toy around? Well, almost. things New Zealand

What parallel universe from? NY NZ completely different things.

The reason low infection NY NY reached [herd immunity threshold [(Nature paper NZ stay isolated rest world years (or eventually give up, let COVID burn NY did.)  counties emulated? Imagine total control back March. would done? freeze bread. I'll get 4 loaves time, 3 go freezer. thaws fine. 
I love almond butter (fluff jam) sandwiches. going go Olympics r/woooosh asking communicable respiratory disease preventable? have, large, sitting home, interacting people since fucking march, going work school running errands. 

Certainly neighborhood, that's case. I've watching kids around play hang months. masks anything. anecdotally, I'd shocked covid already spread like wildfire children already. I've several protests, mask usage overwhelming. fact, largest demonstration, people handing masks along water/snacks/etc. happened upon march yesterday was, far could tell, unanimously masked. matches photos videos I've seen around country. hiding one's identity, that's another great use mask. 

If masks used early days, that's bad news, there's excuse now. See Sturgis event. Yes, that's exponential. right growth around 1.0 in, person gives one person. linear.

Some states bit worst. Hawaii right 1.36 bad. next worst state, Montana 1.13 whereas Arizona 0.86 meaning case counts going (after going 1.25 month ago)

Back March lot states like 3.0 - 4.0 right, large part problem internet. People get stuck giant comspiracy groups, never leave. type brainwashing. simple truth stupid people breed stupid people. Education issue, children product thier upbringing. matter education good, go back home life archaic, racist, comepiracy thinking ideals, children grow mindest, thier children, viscious cycle continue. Also notice Fox websites never behind paywall. mis-information FREE folks seek it. reputable news sites need paywall. I'm guessing depends lot cases found.

Remember 1% avarage across whole population. actual risk dying probably different 1% people. old risk group higher. arent young lower. Soylent veal tender tastier option Oh I’m 100% agreement. don’t think living depressing world social distancing saves lives solution (is got many upvotes? people actually believe that?).

I’d ok with..... ONE fundamental principle public health effect. Washing hands. crowds? Always wearing mask social distancing? That’s life. 

My question this. Let’s say (US/Canada) completely able eliminate virus vaccine + public health initiatives. open border country hasn’t...... can’t get global public health success, honestly always wear masks socially distance? (Obviously answer no, won’t let happen. want know opinions THINK happen).  Speaking math, people look real numbers making judgments. Per 100k things look bit different particularly massive testing disparity added Probably gonna pay vaccine EMIs something. Imagine world 5-10 year prognosis COVID-19 survivors certain death. We'll vaccine long discovered, fallout would massive.

That sounds like start good sci-fi book. imagine reaction something like see Hoarding: Buried Alive family friends comes hoarder's house first time sees rooms piled high trash junk. would say 2/3rds us care great deal. Unfortunately we’ve hijacked. pandemic global pop quiz critical thinking morality. countries, like New Zealand, passed flying colours. Many fall somewhere middle. Others failed critically.

But every country, individuals failed test. hope rest world balls make individuals feel intense shame social ostracization, treating harmful behaviour personal right ""opinion"" like calling murder form art. We're 6 months pandemic. people going fully grasp fucking serious is? global death toll nearing 1 million. Yeah clue people saying 2-5%. get rhetorically effective say kills 1 50 people we're trying fight ignorance anti science behavior kind ironic misrepresent statistics make point. supposed care something isn’t real?

All people fixating hoax trying tank economy get Trump office failed fake impeachment attempt real crisis. 

I could go bullshit people actually believe it. That’s what’s really unbelievable crisis lies. implying Corona rest world would gladly take you? tracked summer? schools even session then? “Mentally unstable American claims responsibility unsolved 1918 murder Germany.” Welp ya don’t like don’t come USA cared month grew bored it. least BC, Canada, they’ve estimated actual cases 8x confirmed, we’ve got 2-3% positivity rate. honestly wouldn’t surprised it’s 10x states since % positivity high. made think guy replying progressive lmao? He's one bro I'm delivery driver catches shit customers coming houses without masks. Like damn man even professional requirement what's wrong wanting safe/do part little. like vote guys year. guy lunatic compulsive liar says crazy things guy liar lied political life entire life pretty much laughed presidential races plagiarization example before. Tough choice. think general Americans (I one) way obsessed “treated,” “cured.” you’re hyper can’t sit still traditional schooling, need prescribe meth.

People anxious, rather teach brain, chemicals cause it, ways put body optimal state handle stress loss, etc. prescribe permanently brain chemistry altering pills long term studies. 

our whole pharmaceutical health care industry runs prescribing people things don’t “need,” squeeze money get hooked. opiate epidemic accident. 

There people severe depression anxiety may kill immediate future, risk permanently altering someone better dying, extreme cases. someone prescribed whole gaggle shit growing up, thing equipped deal anxiety bipolar tendencies psychology neurology textbooks, maintaining regular schedule, eating clean, journaling. 

I agree mental health taken seriously here, it’s taken seriously fronts. Diagnosis aren’t treated seriously public healthcare industry doesn’t actually want natural tools deal yourself.

Hate certainly blame, nearly cases involve people bullied traumatized prior. therapist someone talk things, hate confusion wouldn’t build point wanna line classmates lead.

Edit: mean sound antagonistic, re-reading appears tone, intended. agree points recently conversation times lately things add.   Hes going ,the facts dont line agenda States military. Everything else comment correct though.  doj nothing maybe offer pardon level impunity good patriots lose soldiers, losing young people. losing future generations longer families, losing contributors workforce economy. Losing hundred thousand people mostly obese, 70 years old, don’t many quality years ahead doesn’t really compare, sad is. Dear Americans pond. Please blink twice held captive will... true. Technically ""postponed"", canceled. we'll still get big celebration. (Btw pretty much Holocaust occuring China still feel like jack shit done... someone even do?) That’s reddit loves gloom doooom Americans care, adminstration leadership not. know guys give single fuck. would invite people like you?  work strip club idea fuck opened 20 percent New York it. even close herd immunity. hell matter percentage hospital residents general population. antibody studies population samples. State defense force state national guard Man im texas panhandle. stores require mask get see 3/10 people wearing mask. usualy older white guys fat 20 something year olds. used get pissed hold breath wish slow painfull death. Karen started ""person gets people's business demands accommodated.""

Recent attempts Karens redefine ""anyone accommodate get business"" pretty pathetic, think. hanging friends coronavirus? Why? \- need mention anything. easy read.

\- Oh! count!

\- don’t country care. It’s disgusting. Gathering huge groups without masks. would rather stubborn right wear mask send children back school!!!!!!! WTF America!!!!! insane then. point letting plague infected tourists in? Crazy idea. understand logic. feel One dynamic I'm really hoping lot people already immunity - could explain vast difference symptoms severity people experience, number asymptomatic people.  antibodies. Herd immunity one confusing Covid concepts everybody means something different say it, I'm hopefully there's lot immunity already limited new cases, hospitalizations, deaths many places. American, tell enough us care. answer question, lots us lots us don't. sad people care put risk. Americans have! fuck wrong people? pandemic shown unadvanced species. It’s insane. Canada national expert country provincial expert province. Simply take look Twitter feed. repeat simple steps need followed. ten countries success measures. Month old info isn’t exactly outdated hasn’t research contradicts estimate fact represents systematic review available evidence. Im assuming everyone symptoms gets tested assuming deaths accounted for. clearly didn’t read either links. sooo rich six months ago american redditors giggling China poooor sanitation many people cost life cheap. Started bottom here.. Translated: ""Fuck it"" Rolling Stone long history political involvement, least gonzo journalism Hunter S.

This may completely true it’s sure hell looks. Americans don’t care simply needed 🤷🏻‍♂️ really don’t know better tbh that’s bottom line. Mama always said, “Stupid stupid does.” Nope Dude it’s crazy! fucking roommates decided go Disney yesterday!!!! two months pregnant!!!!!! move end month damn wish could leave sooner. COVID already, hasn’t even two weeks since quarantine finished. 
I see people know going eat restaurants, people going bars, beach, swimming public pools. I’m completely dumbfounded. Keep mind UK handled coronavirus differently did, fraction cases right now. UK schools also structured differently better funded US, that’s discussion another time. study, although applicable UK, work US, situation radically different used argument reopening schools every kid country gets it, whatever percentage deaths occurs children happens, acceptable you? Even reaches thousands? parents, teachers, staff die result rhetoric push? don’t. value profit lives. country fucking sucks."
