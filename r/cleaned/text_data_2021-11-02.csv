0,2021-11-02," Tldr: rammed measure thorough part budget, pass own, specifically forbidden AZ constitution.  Cool story. 0.9 11,  want talk myocarditis, talking info today's discussions showed nine reported cases death myocarditis people age 30, 86 million doses. nine, six fully investigated far. Three confirmed died myocarditis. none actually related vaccines. myocarditis caused bacteria/virus. 

But won't, make scary headline. get kids vaccinated ignore assholes. going you? family members tell mind business write off. think right thing family let live religious prison. wife Sunday, reasoning :). Minimal side effects. Posts like far worse. Stop getting caught upvotes/downvotes second comment posted. 

Reddit millions people it’s quite easy find dissenting opinions comments section. It’s easy read debates see people countering arguments. 

Knowing stuff never welcome Reddit? Talk dramatic bullshit lol. Good god Tucker Carlson can't 90 years future Right now, \*have\* vaccinate them. fact, cannot, since approval 5+. probably couple years diminish fears.

You probably \*should\*, if/when recommended .

Here's reasons why:

1. CDC FDA would estimated benefits \*to kid\* outweigh risks. probably know better :) go read papers data validate, ...
  1. thinking know long-term effects vaccine are, keep mind know long-term effects COVID either ...
2. addition benefits \*to kid\*, benefits community. less COVID going around general, also means less busy hospitals/ER, better outcomes things may happen kids. Chances are, also better economy, better communities etc.
  1. Given communal benefit, might make sense public schools (and maybe group activities) require vaccination join. seems issue couple years ...  It’s pandemic unvaccinated, take look California’s Covid numbers last surge. Despite large number state vaccinated, unvaccinated people accounted 7X cases compared vaccinated people. 

The vaccines effective preventing disease, even delta wave. Great news.

What realistic timetable next group? 3yo can't wait get vaccinated. native Americans write book (or better, encyclopedia) topic. please love God nice to... people

Listen, I'm ardent pro mask vaccine mandates *if that* means put fire control, first moment useless morons say over, I'm tossing box masks dumpster head swinger party. That’s exciting, congratulations! Wishing kids best health. 5 year old tested positive today. wish moving faster, though course understand delay children Exactly. population 400,000. 30% (unvaccinated) 120,000, seeing 100 confirmed cases day. Yet headline makes look like vaccines working. I'm curious, asked reasons get vax? asked pediatrician that. kids already hereditary heart condition (i also it) dad discussing it. However, doctor recommended adult shot. That's **hate** antivaxxers, ruin whole progress pride ego, douches always change minds survive COVID deathbed, cost? Since spreading damaging nonsense always people responsible perpetuating crap. every ex-antivaxxer 50 spawned.

Whenever possible GET booster. vaccine efficiency starts wane GET next booster. Whenever dickhead variant threatens wreak havoc, GET next booster. got second jab back August fine February next year. Whenever health authorities start seeing hospitals overrun again, alert population get next booster.

**That** seems endgame better treatments market, means necessary get booster every six eight months. would make mentally unstable? Because, opinion former LDS person whole mission thing, LDS missions meant cement loyalty individual convert new people. New converts bonus happen. missionary program Mormonism clearly cult-full. Cult-y conditions make loyal soldiers, that's point, that's send missionaries places everyone either Mormon purposefully Mormon.



Side note, Mormon membership numbers self reported, based church's definition, auditable. IIRC, lose track someone move stop attending person still counted Mormon 110 years old.

Any time country collects census data including religious self-identification, official LDS numbers shown inflated. turns substantial amount people affiliated church longer attend actually even consider Mormon anymore. Covid known cause neurological cardiovascular issues people, even symptoms mild. People survive Covid find dealing problems like blood clots, strokes, permanent loss sense taste smell. There's even recent concern Covid causing autoimmune disorders. Covid primarily kills older populations, ""long Covid"" appears impact younger people nearly high rates older people.

It's suspected issues may continue progress, could lead problems like early onset dementia.

Meanwhile, vaccine incredibly safe. Even serious side effects, like myocarditis, rare resolve without permanent damage.

At end day, want explain kid reason can't taste smell anything decided Covid going kill them, worth getting vaccinated.   It’s long time coming. past 5 years I’ve pretty awful experience Southwest consistently.

Well guy, since native island. dont think job done yet. still learning studies population takes shot. actually feel anything covid shots injection. even watched push plunger second third time still feel anything. Agreed. neuro cardiovascular issues people developing Covid scary. want kid spend whole lifetime dealing shit. Blood clots, strokes, loss sense taste smell. 

I'm getting kid vaccinated soon possible. think consensus Colorado pretty well earlier pandemic, there's lot people never infected fertile ground infection. Yeah watched second shot booster instead looking away still feel either going in. Flu shot year felt less usual, still absolute nothing felt covid shot. zero covid rest eternity? surely costly, vaccination allows one live it. Booked 3 4 kids Saturday Utah. one needs wait birthday coming within days he's big enough probably get adult vax. gets happy birthday shot!

I could cry we're finally here!   first vaccines developed without indemnity. Many medications developed without indemnity. 

With logic testing data would far rigorous would agree government fund research, opposed privatized sources funding research trying appease shareholders. Walgreens let book son now. Got appointment Saturday! Lol. Concession accepted.  CO done well compared lot states. also low vaccination rate. 

The outcome large % population completely vulnerable. hope wave calms soon.   Technically that's true. state *could ban* mandates. way wrong.

That's upholding rejection key. court case way law passed, law itself. even fully approved age group? It’s 100 least. definitely could foresee company surpassing 100 employees point. lower court ruled state legislature violated procedural rules banning mask mandates.

The state Supreme Court agreed. That's it.

FWIW, legislature could turn around ban mask mandates, they'd pass standalone bill, roll budget. Richard ? Check local health department, multiple vaccination clinics running accepting appointments.

The vaccine stop spread. Vaccine fully protect you. risks blood clots, Myocarditis, things. efficiency vaccines severely wanes time. 

The reason get vaccine protect YOURSELF. 

I long covid. absolutely terrible. However, antibodies wonderful tested positive since first infection. fence getting vaccine due people condition feeling better. time gone on, people condition reported feeling worse. severely disabled first year condition. Getting vaccine might absolutely harmless, there's still chance could feel worse absolutely cannot go again. 

My mother developed long Covid like symptoms vaccine along blood clots. Never tested positive covid great health. 

Mandating everyone get vaccine potential destroy lot people's quality lives. damn thing actually worked, even need fucking mandate it. 

I'm tired seeing type argument. stupid. Yup.. 1 3 here. We'll hole. Waiting. native island returning home. Read article. Politics worst. Yes, would really surprising 1000 firefighters refused get shot 34 policemen.  Yes unvaccinated population science vaccinated COVID-19 booked kids Saturday Walgreens. think they're 1/10 adult dose opposed 1/3 5-11 population.

Long term cognitive problems, loss sensory function (smell/taste), chronic fatigue......that's minor. Boosters cut risk infection, may end vaccine course 3 shots begin with. saw Melbourne zero infections delta strain introduced. Cue statewide lockdown 2000 daily cases. Even heavy restrictions, stopping spreading. China gain reporting Japan's numbers trending down? Right, also spread vaccine.

To spread COVID get COVID. chances getting COVID vaccine greatly reduced, therefore chances spreading greatly reduced. contagious period also much shorter vaccinated, also reduces risk spreading it. Yeah, definitely want mess menstrual cycle 5-11 year old. mean kids seem avoid major sickness general 

""in general"" mean ""every time"". also long term effects COVID get even theory still catch even getting vaccinated

The odds catching COVID vaccination like 90% lower unvaccinated. means kids less likely transmit virus someone else vaccinated. vaccine also reduces chance ""long COVID"" 50%.

It's 18 months since first vaccine clinical trials reports major side effects vaccine. risks associated COVID outweigh risks associated vaccine.  I'm sorry child young deal emotional toil this. poor, wonderful children.  That's getting at. Firefighters get paid taxes. workers getting premiums used getting 80s early 2000s.

Almost go hospital night of. spent weeks debating even getting booster. decided last min it. allergic reaction Pfizer 20 min in. severe. Red ithcy neck. that, I'm 35 hours in. sore arm far. Ancedotal, figured I'd share experience. Good luck let's hope we're OK long term! Got booster today. Pfizer shots April Moderna today.  Sure he’s saying waiting full approval isn’t strictly necessary (it may politically expedient way) Get shots hopefully similar :) . I'd guess prob higher right COVID cold exist.  Believe one week seen around Reddit. Thanks! terrifying decision, weighing worse (social physical health) two different kids (in age temperament) going grain year really left us second guessing ourselves. also lucky, kids awesome close. start made decision going better person end. stopped drinking, cut back caffeine, made sure exercise meditate think working.

And believe me, toddler around, world right now. missing support system babysitters night out, day care get stuff done, play dates everyone meet new people, HARD. survived and, I’m sure family better bonded it, also paid high price it. Don’t diminish accomplishment! primary reason new restrictions, Olympics? another?  frustrating part parent large 4.5 year old. changed ""weeks"" apparently ""months,"" explanation given change?  ""end year""?? said yesterday, 11/2?

Ridiculously frustrating. month two ago, Pfizer saying data 2-4 year olds would available within ""weeks"" 5-11 year olds. Data 5-11 years olds available late September means, optimistically, data 2-4 year olds available... last week.

I'm asking go faster safe. wish date would stop ping ponging. must ping pong, least offer minimal explanation why. ""I know last month said we'd data November, need couple extra months \_\_\_\_\_\_.""

Instead, change absolutely acknowledgement change. INDIA resumed vaccine export,as 78% adults received dose

China also start export soon gods Cool, I've rooting them. CVS opened 5+ downtime last night. Let’s clear probably February/March. comments made regarding received less effective vaccines like J&amp;J (or “Janssen”) locally developed actively pushed government, AstraZeneca. 

NL also lagger boosters, already rollout vaccination campaign earlier year, measures introduced curb spread virus. state Representative

classic. State legislator-level intelligence. remember someone Arizona wanted spend covid money tourism ads... lotsa foolish people there. Hmm.. maybe start dropping hints Ordnungsamt.

I understand regular customer check know vaccinated. otherwise, ought check. Especially getting colder numbers going again. Lol stay classy Staten Island. us tradesmen don’t freak cough go work Id rather good thing. dont want less good world weird moral good isnt 100% good enough you. 

Rule 303 means bad person lol. Im sorry, need evidence. see becomes grey usable unsubstantial many innocent people get caught it. booked appointment daughter first shot next week. Feels good.   booked, next thursday never went calc 1. pre-req another class degree. finished happy I'd never math again.  Paywalled:  haven’t booked yet, Santa Clara county website vaccine availability. booked slot fairgrounds week. Yeah, that's true. Chance Netherlands going wave hit countries like Spain Portugal later on. stupid deer also refuse wear masks get vaccinated.  Exactly! Asia 0 issues masks (no, don’t wear cuz pollution) Testing people come close contact infected people bare minimum many countries. say little would gained infected people going business usual, especially schools offices? father toddler neither wear mask, get vaccinated, idea letting clusters nurseries schools go untraced stupid lazy. 

It's weird because, time comments jizzing Japan (the initial reply stinks somebody never visited here), got people shitting countries recent spikes cases, ignoring fact countries testing rates 40x higher Japan, testing everybody periodically workplace schools, actively seeking asymptomatic cases. course cases higher. no, apparently people culture problem.  came ready argue looks like claims potentially true 1) myocarditis related illness likely covid-related hospitalization 2) vaccine side effects common natural rate cardiac hospitalizations.

I still likely vaccinate child low risk mild moderate side effects outweighed lower risk serious long term cognitive breathing complications covid

Yeah no, even close.  nice know we're country with...these people, guess. Neandertales gonna Neander

The Neandertal actually [valley bones Neandertals found first time. mandates violate constitutional violating consitution themselves.


Its almost like people dont know law dont research actual difference eight months they're widely available?

FYI:

In Germany, age 60, vaccines widely available 4 months ago. 

Doesn't really change point... I'm pedandic like real german :-)  hope choose Moderna booster despite 2 Pfizers. Sounds like really need it! wanted keep would've closed border UK that's originated. USA, close too.  10 grand pocket

How get money?    ONE side? Sure, regarding 80% figure: vaccination figure varies based news outlet government figure 84%: actually respect 34. think total dumb-dumbs vaccine, least willing suffer consequences dumb-dumb beliefs i.e. go unpaid leave. really infuriating \~1000ish calling sick... i.e. dumb-dumb beliefs, plus stealing paid vacation tax-payer's dime. Lmao exactly. still everything usually mask on. people really locking room something? Also make sound lives exciting begin with. Yeah u get go movie theater months, big fucking deal. neighboring country, government claims ""no proof"" booster would effective. Unless healthcare worker. case, booster indeed effective. Seriously.

Meanwhile consistently one highest infection rates world. dangerous job. Collect coins, stomp mushrooms, …

Really: I'd like firefighter break coughing trying rescue healthy co-worker would survive rescue me. Read fucking article. fully vaccinated tested negative returned home country

Are people supposed give travel now? vaccine stop spread.

&amp;#x200B;

As topic Germany, [a german german state Bavaria, number infected per 100000 inhabitants 9 times higher unvaxxed.

So yes, statement kind true, vaccine completly stop spread severally reduce fully protect you.

Again technically true, whole picture. vaccine protect 100%, severally reduce probability severe disease death.

It's black white, different shades risks blood clots, Myocarditis, things.

More 6 billion doses vaccine given worldwide. Yes, risks exist, mathematically irrelevant. risk get stuck lightning higher getting tired seeing type argument.

Me too.

I'm tired people twisting truth inconsequent evalutating different risks. going club movie theater affects much though might want look obviously deeper issues there. think anything introverted extroverted. That, also people trust government - personally can't blame that. U.S. government done plenty shit warrant mistrust people. mean hard it, global superpower, provide clear accurate information nationally global health crisis/emergency? even see happen COVID ever? Nope, corporations put together vaccine record time sell government, that. 

Politicians - governors, Congress, presidential administrations, etc done many things interest people, own's self interests pursuit higher power, wealth, social status. Looking food industry America nothing bolster idea FDA better rest federal government.

If healthy people would rather get injected almost guaranteed naturally fight virus, understand that. people deny vaccine start getting sick need hospitalized - taking valuable medical resources time putting other, vulnerable people risk - that's super shitty.

DISCLAIMER: answer, intention spread misinformation, claim expert politics, biology, sociology, medicine. sharing perspective, vaccinated, young, American despises internet ""discussions"". They're exempt rules like this. People legit medical issues also wear masks area mask mandate. people masked/vaccinated want to, stuff applies We've year despite people bitching Boston yesterday touring college niece. live across border CT, felt like different world there. Still feels like middle pandemic masks signs. still tons people even masking outdoors, seen home quite awhile. know Boston Massachusetts general highest vaccination rates country endgame? college visited one niece's top choices, feeling covid vibe city all, can't say blame her. environment I'd want college years. thought fully approved 16+ ? elementary aged kids scheduled next Thursday! “end” Covid family! happened times Australia people quarantine hotels caught adjacent rooms, due ventilation issues. Daniel Tiger give booster? continue feel comfortable this.

94 deaths 1.9 million cases... case fatality rate 0.004%. low hard accurately measure statistical significance.

The real reason promoted children, protect them, protect **adults**... especially, adults refuse get vaccinated idiotic beliefs..

I already predict going quickly become mandatory lot children, honestly uncomfortable idea mandating parents give kids shot protect idiot adults. give comfort. Meh, people angry breath bad breath.

/s Unbelievable bad messaging this. said ""weeks"" data 5-12 year olds, total radio silence since data released, ""early 2022""? found link last night. icon bottom scheduling page.

I able schedule 2 appointments cancelled since signups tested. Yes, yes will. end humans wants to, tired it, feels bad. virus feelings ability care. hunter bodies prey, mammal, behaves differently us comprehend. wants, yet mechanics existence survive collective, even though know, less know part something larger. part mitigate it. live it, OK target it.

Vaxx up, mask up, wash hands, encourage indoor spaces open windows possible, add air filters, etc. live life want. UK managed get enough people infected summer months ease situation winter months needless suffering. amazing vaccines are, still allow lot people infected. need speed booster rollout counteract waning immunity, wonder opinions different 2 / 3 months time. made appointment kids. get dosed within week! Testing free think sick contact. Testing want prove travel covered. also fee cover handling data Hawaii well. Results go directly Hawaii fake them. think problem staffing. I'm sure they'd bring right could staffing crisis :( absences count children kids school, appreciate. miss many days, need talk school assume kid falling behind. want make sure parents school working together kid.

They given perfect attendance awards even COVID, excused/unexcused really thing. award basically rewarding kids showing sick.  Bummer testing. live? Illinois free available testing since least July 2020    flying amsterdam US tomorrow night... lol. fully vaccinated + boosted particularly worried, glad even show proof negative test border. coming NYC, wear masks shops etc nothing new.

and dutch coworkers seem fairly blasé covid rules... confused too, reminds Friends episode: "" know know know"". inconsistent wrote. heard exmormon subreddit left (Tonga) mission (to Africa), got tested repeatedly (before) going home (back Tonga), come positive arriving (in Tonga). Poor guy. US start giving COVID-19 vaccines young check box preexisiting conditions take card. one question you. far, folks choose leave getting vaccine eligible unemployment severance. eligible retirement take early retirement, they'll get pension, coming anyways.

You havent presented single, logical leg stand far. understand. December end year? led exposure boomer population. Masks really thing Denmark April/May. June last masking requirements removed. half year haven’t wearing masks, current rise cases really doesn’t much us mask-less rather it’s peak season respiratory viruses everyone indoors. 

Will need restrictions going winter? Probably. 
Was worth removing restrictions June? Definitely! Life basically like pre pandemic life definitely needed long winter last year. Hopefully last proper wave going next year people boosters and/or natural immunity. Yeah, sure else tell actually think vaccine-induced myocarditis anywhere ballpark covid-induced myocarditis. really even close. truly concerned protecting kids getting myocarditis, get vaccinated. data super clear, math fairly simple, no-brainer. Ridiculous. compulsory now. They’re business saving lives spreading disease. obvious sensible approach. like keeping removing restrictions forever anyways.

OP basically implying lifting mask mandates September caused rising cases today. is, explained, ridiculous. Nepotism. familiar Reagan, air traffic controllers you? happen Netherlands, everyone needs masks again.  people focusing case numbers don’t want end. They’ve built personalities around COVID.  considering traffic obviously dictates Tuesday first day week cities everyone ‘calls sick’ Mondays. Agreed. Scandinavian countries restrictions proportional legally enforceable. Politicians able keep mandate sake safe side. basically, cases decline, restrictions removed, reintroduced needed. use daughter. growth hormone deficient needs get daily injection keep getting enough hormone keep growing. injections subcutaneous, much smaller shorter needle intramuscular shot, buzzy works well numbing area. Yes Yeah got booster dude practically threw syringe like harpoon… one hurt traditional, whole Virion vaccine mRNA avoidant. good news. That’s fear well. We’ve done things supposed since beginning. It’s strained relationships friends family we’ve always chosen path safest includes least possible exposure. 

I want able simple, normal stuff, like take kid Best Buy. go sit meal restaurant. we’re able introduce experiences til vaccine since live deep-red part country houses lot anti-vaccination anti-masking sentiment. No, *you* get high horse.

Your critique baseless, especially applied Denmark. seem aware whole thing unfolded. Danes largely stopped wearing masks well *before* removing restrictions. last restrictions lifted September, hard time finding anyone wearing mask Copenhagen April already.

Same rest Nordics. Actually places like Norway never point pandemic strong mask mandate; masks recommended crowded indoor places social distancing otherwise possible.

Also, Earth ""far quickly"" mean? Denmark lifted restrictions gradually course *months*, cases kept declining meantime. rising again, expected. Arguing lifted restrictions qUiCkLy, basically implying there's direct causal link ""too quick removal"" ""rising cases"", completely disingenious - cases rising around Europe, including places never removed restrictions.

So again, get high horse, get info straight, stop treating masks deal breaker they're demonstrably not.   really Pro-plaugers elections local area. bode well.  1 year old absolutely chomping bit get vaccinated. unfortunately don’t think sense urgency 5 year olds continue forgotten rest world moves goes back normal, weren’t already. Awesome thanks. looking agree you, think general population start getting boosters January. capacity, willingness stock seems place. 

For J&amp;J AZ think booster place even 6 months passed, vaccines seem wane much quicker.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Still totally worth opinion spent day bed yesterday getting booster day prior. Worst reaction FAR three. indication release?  ever end?  It’s do. one feels empowered change things. honestly, energy organize working frontline?  Bulgarian here. Access vaccines problem. problem people want get vaccinated due to:

- lack information campaign




- doctors talking vaccines





- doctors, including doctors treat Covid patients, refuse get vaccinated




- politicians talking vaccination building election programms around it.




- people beliebe conspiracy theories get information unreliable sources





- people trusting government institutions




- wildly inaccurate understanding democracy right choice sacred whatever want without consequences  Supply one thing I’m worried about… wait long. allow everyone who’s vaccine 6 months ago, got J&amp;J get boosters now, winter peak. It’s like donating doses countries, stock.  heard CDC Director NPR say they’re expecting trial data 5yr old vaccine til “early 2021”. 

I’ve hopeful it’d available end Dec. could travel see family sounds like idea it’s going ready.  There's already nursing shortage, unvaccinated nurse better nurse. keep pushing 5’s back. end year 2-5s. always 6 weeks data release EUA. it’s unconstitutional….. Hell, kids mind wearing mask (actually autistic 9 yo loves it) told one step closer rid masks game! facemask tyranny!

/s Yes, even non profits work work way. dollar rules capitalist system. Absolutely. wish people less gross apt care actions effect others?

Yep. recall talking friends admin well. people actually care. also experienced moral distress much like burned out. I’m sure businessmen higher calling shots insulated actual reality decisions maybe that’s cycle repeats even now. people sick heads. i'd get society antivaxxers. pandemic global, unprecedented event, overgrown toddler office, pretending wasn’t happening, first year it. 

And yes, scientific messaging changed **as new data unprecedented, black swan event** came in. 

The “put together vaccine record time” rhetoric played now, 1) mRNA vaccine platform already existed 2) extensive research coronaviruses already existed 3) EVERY GOVERNMENT WORLD THROWING SCIENCE MONEY IT. Yes, you’re goddamned right happened fast, proud. 

But no, keep playing stupid games pretend scientists Scooby Doo villains. even people vaxxed getting Covid. somehow nobody cares? Netherlands 8 million vaccine doses stock. think people able get 6 month mark. Pfizer deliver 34 million doses Netherlands next year supply issue first shot fine heard *pop* followed lot pain second. Worth it. Sorry, vaccines required domestic and/or international travel now, parental discretion? 5 years pay $110,000 per year, first year $45K though. can’t Reddit without bombarded vaccine propaganda. Unvaccinated people see won’t care it’s purely anecdotal. It’s changing mind unvaccinated people reason even see it. Especially considering it’s CNN. work waste water. get alot time off, poop water get pretty sick. Firefighters NYC probably need time too. think time future vulnerable? get old? think time future vulnerable? get old? lot company. saw local news action filming story. Stopped watching immediately decision stick unvaccinated kids cramped metal tube full people varying vaccine covid mitigation status beliefs.

We felt adults got vaccinated, exactly abandoning kids, go trips work trips since drive trips chance, flown either anyway. understanding also rate patient facing employees higher headline rate limited benefit requiring far. likely look like they're something something impact, although could also top immunity winter months. course want keep port longer to, comparison apt we're talking two things enormously different terms level inconvenience (which original point: trivial wearing mask compared things people every day)

I'm even sure exactly position would take mask mandates moment -- agree especially outdoor mandates seem like theater point. weird people act like wearing mask huge deal causes great stress life. mask comfortable need buy different mask.  kids colds right now, long need wait book appointment? young man returning mission Africa spent several weeks working New Zealand returning Tonga.

Why NZ wasn’t part mission? work leaving mission getting home stopped NZ? It’s crazy Mormon missionary spend time outside mission boundary’s point still serving mission. young man returning mission Africa spent several weeks working New Zealand returning Tonga.

Seeing faces perhaps things changed permanently many ways continue change going forward. We'll never get back 2019 earlier keep looking forward instead back. Kids getting sick big enough benefit require less masks measures, also hope society act like Asian countries wear masks colds sort thing going forward.  hate possibility ethnic cultural factors still relevant policy may even growing relevance. also got Moderna booster last week Pfizer first two. slightly achey tired foggy day first two shots. Moderna, chills intense aches, well heavy fatigue brain fog begin lift day 4. arm sore them, moreso Moderna shot. opted Moderna booster since half-dose booster still higher dose mRNA Pfizer. So, makes sense experienced side effects. Glad feeling better OP! parent decided put oldest virtual hold back youngest kindergarten huge sigh relief. hope get back normal. Hopefully younger ones get start December, goes along schedule Pfizer said back.  really hope so! I’m seriously cry right kids finally protected. Exactly, vaccines no-brainer people public service. interesting see law enforcement country continues regress towards state similar third world countries. difference tax payer funding expensive force incompetence. police unions keeping quality service high, disbanded reformed something that's optimized city's needs, especially cities like NYC, vaccines supported majority. Brazil (at least live) restrictions know still used starting today mask mandate (and possibly vaccine passport, seen used yet everywhere afaik)

Honestly? think beginning end pandemic Brazil (again, least live), every restriction mention lifted. Hope day comes soon, truly do! appointment morning went well. almost got CNN get work left still setting cameras. Walgreens earliest us, Saturday 🎉 much protection infection third vaccine/booster provide ? breakthrough cases possible booster?  9yo scheduled Saturday! Keeping little safer Louisiana covidiots. think we've reached phase USA need benchmarks established removal restrictions, benchmarks need tied realistic goals rooted science, fear. fine government entities saying ""we need get x% fully vaccinated masks become optional"", etc. way qualified judge numbers be. stage, need numbers set people understand none permanent. Continuing proud tradition!  ""anti-mask""

&lt;Proceeds go four paragraph anti-mask I'm mostly referring visitors medical staff. yes, I've hospitalized, also watched family member die pneumonia contracted hospital virus circulating. Ha! That’s said too… “if want travel again, need get vaccinated”.  …Have ever hospitalized? emergency surgery spent week hospital years ago, forced wear mask entire time would beyond miserable. 

Seeing faces important. able move breath exist freely important. Life existence full pathogens. There’s lot truth life expose stronger are. going life plastic port attached sternum receive chemo week.

Well sounds like medical necessity treatment, enduring hopes one day remission longer need it. Masks similar. medically necessary vaccines, people option getting efficacious vaccine longer medical necessity people settings USA. Would friend continue want plastic port attached sternum cancer goes remission longer needs chemo? deal here. I'm sorry find masks uncomfortable.

I prefer cloth ones soft scratchy face. Since I'm vaccinated, I'm ok risk level. wear paper mask, find way uncomfortable. worry, certainly release data. taking time higher risk/benefit threshold extremely young children. Yeah. got mine Walgreens. checked relevant box form (my job puts elevated risk).

The thing doubled checked vaccine card make sure indeed 6 months out. Tylenol want take much preserve liver. waited least year something wrong dose antibody levels already high something. second vaccine nowhere painful. 100 fever constant pain everywhere body 1.5 days straight. second vaccine sick 4 hours. Russia, covid contracts you! Awesome! 3 year olds take toddler public again. early get appointments weekend. felt like vaccines first rolled back March. Right, kinda cycles back point people coughing sneezing things places like grocery stores hospitals. think hospitals require going forward, maybe would prevent crud constantly circulates there.  Don’t insult babies like that. argument even making? I'm stating fact, since 3 year old home still waiting. Missions also strengthening existing congregations, converting new ones happened thread! people really triggered parents children certain age would get vaccinated. worried getting vaccine? you’re free wear one forever want to. endless requirements need end point.  long haul flight earlier year preferred mask. time get cold flying (and fly fair amount). Again, breathing peoples' recycled air particles something I'd prefer 🤷 Seriously, give us update please totally understand you’re coming from. It’s awful. I’ll get vaccinated it’s going take lot consideration. don’t want dissuade anyone getting booster, suggest snacks medicine ready.  flying regular life? answer yes, yes are.

I’m happy people wear masks long much want comfortable in, requirements need end.

I travel internationally extensively, wearing mask endlessly 24 hour + travel days lot. There’s endless announcements them, you’re already exhausted uncomfortable, never get break, makes much harder communicate foreign languages speaking people accents, cause havoc sensitive skin. People taking eat drink constantly anyway it’s mostly security theater. Travel long hauls see much wears you. It’s one thing, it’s hundred tiny things add huge hassle. pfizer booster. worst 36 hours life. moaning pain. still massive headache. care anymore. I'll never ever get another vaccine again. feel like idiot getting 3 vaccines almost crying pain day half morons charlatans strut unvaccinated. society can't depend carry it. corona end year, I'm happy pass breakthru infection unvaccinated idiot. IMO legislators, public officials, etc. want kids get vaccinated, need start establishing benchmarks things like school mask mandates, quarantines, etc. going away. Exactly.

That said, hopefully unmasked next school year least forget intentionally fostering culture machismo anti-expertism (not exactly anti-intellectualism, hold intellectualism high regard many aspects, like literature field, chess, math, computers/programming). I'm anti-vax, I'm crazy 5yo getting vaccine. Mostly got booster yesterday, i've felt really awful following shot (short-lived, 12 hours. sore arm, pretty heavy flu-like symptoms). feel bad putting child that.

but.... trust adults. family (his grandparents, uncles, etc) getting vaccinated. need get vaccinated. Nobody near knows how/when get done though. breakthrough case little month ago respitory issues were, indeed, minor part. really weird things like insides cheeks got sore/raw teeth were. also got ""mask-ne"" chin first time ever. breathing virus mask caused settle chin infect skin way? Looking back also see focus executive functioning been.

Very glad vaccines. Mild case I've back 100% now. think 4,600 participants FDA referenced study, yes, possible risks somehow higher younger age group current 12+ group, say substantially higher based ~4000 subjects tested.

If parent truly concerned, always wait three weeks month see safety signals get triggered choose children vaccinated. would cops die earlier? really enough police shootings make life expectancy difference. Firefighters exposed sorts toxic chemicals smoke, cops aren't. state coronavirus task force reported 40,443 new confirmed cases day earlier. fifth time seven days country reported 40,000 infections. task force also reported daily record 1,189 COVID-19 deaths.

Less 35% Russia's 146mil people all, Russia’s state coronavirus task force reported 8.6 million confirmed coronavirus cases 242,000 deaths pandemic — far highest death toll reports Russia’s state statistical service Rosstat tally coronavirus-linked deaths retroactively reveal much higher mortality numbers. report released last week indicated 462,000 people COVID-19 died April 2020 September year. find weird goal reduce community spread deadly disease. OP rule district seems indicate requirement in-person learning restricting access learning. sounds similar measures would likely put place earlier reduce risk many schools remote learning - case risk contracting spreading disease.  can't tolerate wearing mask length time

umm.... why?

just thinking friend mine cancer right going life plastic port attached sternum receive chemo week. Regardless stance mask mandates, sounds like your'e baby. Yeah I’m fully-vaxxed nervous size trial dosage size. male child 5 years old, even though third dose adult level dose, worried much 34 pound body. There’s big difference size 11 year old boy 5 year old boy. interested making child sacrificial lamb protect older folks refusing vaccine data trial small don’t know myocarditis risks. covid never one question FDA CDC - kids got vaccinated schedule. I’m increasingly feeling like aren’t answering question. would say quantify means?  Unless things changed went, church provides accommodation. pay church certain amount month, provide accommodation stipend food. move place place times two years spend there. parents basically funded mine. Meanwhile already received Pfizer booster Friday 2x Sinovac initial doses (May June), despite 31-year-old healthy woman. need extra immunity. hope UK rolls third doses everybody soon. maskless Indiana, delta variant loving that. 40% country thinks getting covid best way get covid country whose government created world's misinformation coronavirus? Shocking. still ""relying others"" phase 5s announced....  find worrying constantly, visit doctor. Trust me. hope feel better soon, too! UK indeed crucial testcase endgame strategy. 

The one watch getting clue future developments India.  TTS literally condition occurs receiving COVID vaccine.

Your aunt's doctor could told can't get vaccinated due TTS get TTS vaccinated. first observed AstraZeneca also occur J&amp;J. 

You either lying completely ignorant aunt's medical history conditions doctor allegedly gave guidance offer nothing conversation besides saying people actually can't vaccinated, fact virtually everyone acknowledges. Firefighters cops get around pay NYC cops issue dying way earlier gen pop. Yup! 78% efficacy 12 months shelf life regular refrigeration  care country in, serious problem leaders very, clear exactly they're recommending, why, when. We're two years nearly, there's excuse point. Flying without masks. Living without masks.

Nothing normal masks 100% required.  overrunning hospitals highly-vaccinated areas? Seattle it’s people flown Idaho Montana.   Right? mean clear Chinese operatives work today lmao I'm masking either unless business establishment requires it, I'm nine months pregnant (and triple vaxxed). basically know people assume NYS masked, restricted hellscape, experience all. town 85% percent vaccinated--we're done here.

While think masks permanent, think time revoke COVID emergency powers certain politicians. ""wait see"" approach made sense last year, today. mean... surely learned prepare that, right? you’re vaccinated immunocompromised go things. Thank Thank you! “Well aunts roommates cousin spinal fusion diabetic!!!” anyone good information tinnitus side effect boosters (or general)? got J&amp;J March within days got mild case tinnitus 8KHz (went ENT/audiologist). noticeable quiet situations part. However, hear 1/40-50K person type effect, happened likely happen Moderna booster? Meaning, 1/40000 per vaccine, one lucky 40,000 there's good risk/chance could get worse? 

There seems real information think 'ask doctor' really help. tinnitus subreddit self selected doom/gloom, worry gets worse, could really ruin life. I'm board vaccines obviously, feels like gray area worried mess with. I'm Mid 40's, healthy really think booster except J&amp;J long ago. No, trying help OP find way deal better masks here. Effective treatments might developed ‘kicking road‘. view combination vaccines, naturally acquired immunity (increasing rate slowed enough overwhelm hospitals) effective medication allow us full return normal life. won’t permanent US drop cases people start wanting restrictions IMMEDIATELY lifted. according worldometers US still 1000 deaths yesterday it’s like pandemic over.  Children 5-11 approved vaccinated people immediately clamoring removal restrictions kids even vaccinated.  amazing shitty still this, far pandemic.

It already fully rolled supply chain. able start giving shots today everywhere. nothing vaccines.

Delta variant cannot stop vaccine quarantine strategy. need vaccine quarantine together.

Singapore, used Moderna Pfizer, large surge (over 3000+ compared single digits changing living virus model). say Pfizer Moderna bad vaccine.  I’m judging opinion here, want flag person want wear mask—in circumstances—basically forever. Which, fine, understand you’re coming even disagree.

But many comments, people say “no one wants wear mask,” though it’s kind strawman us tired masking invented.  Getting flu without gotten flu shot first increases chances dying heart attack 30% next 12 months. getting flu shot increases risk death roughly amount smoking.

Not I'm doubting random statistics but, source this?  That’s hard measure, per Pfizer presentation FDA, page 28, around day 50 first dose, first vaccinated infected (vs 3 unvaxxed ) it’s hard say first dose, efficacy is.   campus unvaccinated tested weekly (very small number people) vaccinated tested every two weeks. one surrounding areas still masking. point it’s tied mask mandate NY State owned buildings (the whole campus obviously). However knowledge marker set gets lifted, it’s amorphous point future. even one SUNY saying anything lifting campus mask mandates NY lifts state buildings. Personally I’ve masked anywhere else campus since May Cuomo lifted mandate. Heck I'm willing whatever restaurant choose lol. V5.0?  It’s wholesome think science plays fraction reason anyone still unvaccinated Yes don’t always choice matter   also got ""mask-ne"" chin first time ever.

I also got breakthrough case. extremely tired. never felt ""sick."" kid exhausted feel wake surgery.  Masking become talisman sides. see lot comments Reddit effect “I wear mask don’t want people think I’m republican.”  Flu shot bribed ice cream. Definitely going Happy Meal COVID shot - good call!  Didn’t issues second shot, feeling fine 18 hours booster. Everyone’s experience seems bit different.  awesome explanation bit cherry picking. story went Denmark like experts saying possibility consider experts saying necessary. far sort official recommendation. media asking bunch experts quotes. Welp, got two emails two concerts postponed. One June 2022 one February 2023. want life back. want happy again. much ask? much ask artist freinds brink homelessness? much ask go another virtual funeral friend who's taken life? much ask go back normal? cool Getting flu without gotten flu shot first increases chances dying heart attack 30% next 12 months. getting flu shot increases risk death roughly amount smoking.

So, really, even flu isn’t flu. SUNY testing every five weeks vaccinated students faculty? live New Paltz things looking pretty damn normal here. Packed bars, zero masks outside campus.  


I definitely think need metrics ramps ending I'm ASAP, seem like SUNY bad Northeast colleges universities. Portland exact thing. Masks till spring soonest help flu spread. Agree everyone else’s comments. Wanted add that, similar vaccines, children get it, protects children cannot get whatever reason children immunocompromised. read link, Boris. big deal, interfere life

How interfere life? Legitimately asking, I'm vaxxed, never stopped wearing mask, wearing one interfere life all.  made sons appointment Walgreens next Friday. Wanted next day school case feels crappy! wait actually over

It ever over. either continue wearing mask rest life choose wear one. report I've 2 covid shots + 1 flu shot life back normal now. 

Lots antivaxxers visiting hospital reason though! That's I'm discussing, I'm discussing lack updated discussion behind recommendations things like, well what's mentioned article, told people stock up, explain mean perishable groceries, led runs food, predictably causing shortages unnecessarily, situations past reasoning behind asking people buy n95s better led distrust masks science general, still little conversation boosters, needs it, newest information available (we learning despite tailored specifically newer strains, boosters cause robust development new strain specific neutralizing antibodies), etc.

The messaging needs improve, starting explaining science behind immune systems. Far many people think antibodies basically stand serious disease death, that's absolutely true. Yup excited! also protect people serve. Otherwise spread virus everywhere. Get face officer. vaccinated? first 2-3 months everyone gets call days back? lol   catastrophic stroke 2017 age 34. highly highly recommend whatever avoid it. please people, get vaccinated get love too. mean, I'm pessimistic future regards COVID all, think many countries able China did. also think necessary 

I think better strategy might CDC recommending -- case levels hit certain levels, additional restrictions activate.  
It's lot European countries well. Denmark enjoyed great deal relatively safe freedom summer, safe, adding restrictions back, possibly. 

It would nice made something like official policy, think sustainable lie, extrapolation.

The vaccine less efficient appeared early on. disappointment, sure. vaccine made things lot better, solved problem completely. piggy back yes we're seeing lower infection (or really symptom) rates young people, really idea long term effects Covid. several anecdotal cases people right long term Covid, necessarily long haulers they're 100% months later.

We made choice stay locked event long term effects. case long term effects want tell son ""sorry X, mom really wanted go concert""  less aggressive person giving feedback poster, think right thing. Remember, kid might better reaction did. adults know got vaccine minimal effects, kids tend strong kind thing. Won’t regime everyone dead he?  pandemic ends virus runs food, don’t see ending restrictions helping that. Lots people Brazil might immunity though. case rate falling according nytimes. Yes, latest data indications really seems vaccine reduce infection transmission enough meaningful. Field experts emphasizing purpose vaccine prevent severe illness, splendidly.

In light this, seems countries mostly vaxxed metric concerned hospital capacity, article Denmark's concerns. Can't say 255 hospitalizations seems significant me, suppose could exponentially increase seeing transmission surge might hurt much extra cautions awhile. Top 30... Sounds like lot bad luck! Love positivity. meanwhile protect like hermit crab. What, school mask mandates? Georgia resident here. Outside crazies (Bolsonaro), they're recommending people get vaccine. pretty clear. wouldn’t able daily basis

I think rational scared run burning building scared vaccine that's safely administered billions people multiple times. long term symptoms really common unvaccinated people. Get boosters want, trying avoid catching essentially endemic disease extent silly. wish make choice either got kid appointment next Wednesday. symptoms you, sick 12 hours, beats dead covid like husband's coworker. death scared crap us. kid saying he's ready I'm telling get ready, could save life least prevent long-term problems. state outdoor mask mandate Washington state, large events 500 people. masks required walks park.  baffles mind state that? 'logic' assume mean comparing idea preconceptions set aligns.  5 year old too, plan warn kindergarten teacher ahead time he's getting vax may day afterward depending it. sick baby suck, hear you! Moderna also said anticipate approval January 2022. Fire ""heroes."" Dehydration headaches joke. they're also easily cured avoided entirely. We're messaging properly.  Honestly felt way. side effects joke. But, looking side effects kids vs side effects adults pretty promising. kids dose much smaller (10ug kids, vs 30-100ug adults, depending brand). kids side effects. I'm feeling hopeful. 

There's graph Pfizer put side effect data, I'll edit comment find it. He's scheduled 4th 30th. Sadly, probably right.

I'm neurotic germs, recognize sustainable approach people.

However, true people colds deadly, think good idea normalize basic hygiene, might include wearing mask sneezing coughing (more usual non-sickness related stuff) going public. also, baby getting approved vaccines going integrated member society. Oh, capitalist overlords little humanitarian letting slaves take time isolate feel sick. You’ve seen movies. flu strain declared extinct, scientists drilling ice cores Antarctic allow one cores accidentally thaw, thereby releasing dormant virus infect rest humanity. Masks normal. International travel restrictions testing requirements normal.

We're back normal hear word ""mask"" context Halloween costume COVID tests given extreme circumstances. China massive country looking excess deaths per 100,000 best way evaluating response Covid, better Europe factoring population size. 5yo Pfizer trial fully vaxxed since June!   seems increasing evidence vaccines drastically reduce chance infection well. zero risk, lot better unvaccinated. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article economist's sources suggest actual excess death rate 25-50 per million. That's low number, many times higher official covid fatality rate 3 per million.

People act ""China enormous ever-growing death toll"" ""China reporting reasonable accuracy"" two options, given insanely low China's claims are, perfectly possible could massively undercounting deaths *and also* virus control. idea EU accept Canadian International Vaccine Passport ? siblings? immunocomprised 'friend' brother, one family members have. Yes, he's vaccinated. currently going radiation latter part cancer treatment. So, yeah, could get Covid, immunized parts make things bit positive outlook beating cancer. weird dream last year crowded bar friends shoulder shoulder people. vividly consciously aware dream one masks on, including me, became uncomfortable lol.  I'd like preemptively thank unvaccinated shutdown 3.0. intentional point. one stupid. available 5 up

*for 24 hours now* Island helps. core progressivism giving shit people around you. insanely hypocritical call progressive bare minimum public health. Yes, things suck, making vaccinations - _that little thing could keep catching spreading deadly disease_ - political statement. nothing progressive, brave, remotely sane, matter, that.

You _desperately_ need reevaluate moral compass much tying _word_ ""progressivism"" identity rather underlying ideas strives for. stories happening India, yes.

North Korea mystery. nation could best job hiding major outbreak world, also nation could best job stopping one (infectious disease control much easier without human rights getting way). could worst outbreak world could outbreak all. Neither would surprising tbh. Keep mind, people survived Ebola. Masks, handwashing, social distancing new ideas; especially want spend last days shitting digestive tract. triage based vaccination status. combo stayed outside. lowest vaccine rate area go maskless. reasoned, rational response would say ""if feeling ill, wear mask. sick, need one.""

Unfortunately, significant portion population refuse make choice, left them. selfishness ruins rest us.

So people can't responsible, thinking adults, everyone treated like child told wear mask time.

It sucks everyone. one wants go forever. hope understand mandates exist. people proven, time again, getting choose right easy, choose selfish path possible every single time. feel like no-brainer point. Vaccines really make impact, even they're perfect. Masking vaccinated population seemed like theater anything else face effective vaccines are.  health safety, loved ones, enough know tell you.

And I'm suggesting going something purposely hurt others. thought process part downward spiral. Hoping catalyst indirectly hurt millions bad lead worse. find stats Russia? mask nightmares months ago would public without mask. Several times. India reportedly dumping lots bodies river causing clogging issues downstream? thought recalled something like months ago?

And North Korea. I’d really like know what’s going there. Say want Australia's lockdown tactics, numbers incredible compared rest world. ask question even specify country you’re talking about?

European codes work. That’s know.  66+44=110 there’s “typo” “The pandemic far over,” said Spahn, member Christian Democratic Union (CDU).

Let's forget genius weeks ago said restrictions end November. breaking point selfish assholes ""did research"". empathy choose unvaccinated gone. die, die. Boo hoo. That's saying. feel you. I’m Texas people pretending like COVID doesn’t exist all, New York City last weekend felt like “new normal.” Masks, vax cards, lived life. way precautions. Unfortunately us don’t live places feel safe living lives bc one takes precautions.  really know, guess, I'd say Costco. generally treat employees lot better companies. experience working pharmacy employees, retail pharmacies general great. I've heard many say last place want work comes field.  basically 100% agreeing posted. true Facebook really, break actual deaths almost 55 years old. fair 33% percent unvaccinated lot people age 18 general recomendation vaccine available (under 12). 77.5% adults actually vaccinated.

Still enaugh share opinion regarding Voluntary unvaccinated... course, day pediatric vaccines approved, son's class quarantine due positive case. Thank FDA CDC slow-rolling kids' vaccines bureaucratic nonsense.  hope attend event Netherlands mid-December. use country's vaccination QR code need specific one Netherlands?  fault. Apologies CVS main page says ""select"" locations.

My CVS one these. Walgreens Walmart Target pharmacy locations. local pharmacy let schedule flu shot we've already gotten. hospital said they're trying update system check back ina day two. Finally, public health department said they're going hold meeting Friday discuss roll ""limited supply"" children's vaccines.

I live metro 100,000 people. small many certainly rural. Get program, people. Ha, kind joke, reversed. suppose went little subtle there. But, fear mentality spread soon kids get protected, politicians corporations push get folks ignore vague hope returning old ways spending money. 

But, knows?, maybe whole Russian roulette long covid game work though... \~90% vaccinated U.S. adults eligible boosters. 1)hand every workplace poster clear, concise messaging, well locations get vaccinated

2)enforce vaccine mandate within month placing said poster, shot job (medical exemptions get pass)

If anything observed medical mandates lot people follow antivax logic jobs line. Plus helps protect people legitimately cannot get vaccine. Granted, there'll people faking notes, far, fringe minority.   Yep. Stuck limbo, again, now. also depends muscle. twitch needle skin moves differently. triggers nerves. muscle stays limp whole way feel little sometimes nothing. seek help bud. thoughts healthy. 

Not trying dick all. seriously dangerous thought spiral get into. Oh, China appears massively undercounted too. Who'd thought?

That's exaggeration there. estimated undercount China Germany less US, France, Spain, UK, Sweden etc. Considering got hit first wave nobody knew WTF going tests widely available, estimated undercount pretty impressive. Sigh.  Right? shaming anti-vaxxers chance leasing vaccinating, already would happened. Breakthroughs real, immunocompromised people real, proper masking works. Seems irresponsible rule cases steep increase.  found one Saturday Walgreens responded comment claiming Florida making numbers.

Of course china making numbers. I'm 100% pro vaccine, immunocompromise friend chance getting Covid vaccinated person unvaccinated person. year long study found viral loads vaccinated unvaccinated people. existing outdoor mask mandates Washington Oregon follow CDC recommendations masks worn even outdoors ""crowded"" settings. weird part states following [the CDC recommendations * general, need wear mask outdoor  * areas [high numbers COVID-19 consider wearing mask crowded outdoor settings activities [close others fully vaccinated.

Note currently ""high numbers COVID-19 cases"" link goes map showing currently applies United States. OK. makes sense. live place driver operates grabby thing side truck reaches picks garbage hoists big hole roof truck dump in. Quite system they've got save cost guy lifting trash cans. guess injuries issue that's it.  Early studies suggest Moderna. thats awesome, wanted take something like instead. feel sore arms anything took like way people took mrna one did? guessing lot people got really bad side-effects. Millions people shown booster jab UK, hope change mind soon. opposite experience. 2nd shot made feel quite ill following day next. 3rd shot briefly questioned could placebo woke next morning.

If still scenario Covid-19 could go away entirely someday maintaining measures would make sense. wishful thinking still believing defined *end* Covid-19. That's countries like Denmark made decision reduce drop measures hit likely max vaccination rate.

Since that's case anymore makes sense adjust measures needed ensure overload medical system, wisely maintain safety margin even reaching capacity. many people children, like picture choking last breaths away loved ones

Because many people children also work, home Quarantine ten twenty thirty days could bankrupt funny thing Russians believe Russian government spreading disinformation Russians, disinformation English. go RT Tass, English articles Covid Russian also. ask Russian government spreading information people. percentage population thinks they’re naturally immune? muh rightz! really, that’s article says. article focused Covid flu, ignored that. 


Here is, hoping mask mandate lifted, thanksgiving Christmas, Covid numbers 200 day. Thank kind reply. Take care stay well. Agree. exquisitely simple solution. Covid, probably. view combination vaccines, naturally acquired immunity (increasing rate slowed enough overwhelm hospitals) effective medication allow us full return normal life.

\^ This. medical treatments one take home (or less involved monoclonal infusion) reduce risk breakthrough infection common, things different. Lets get therapeutics there.

I've checking scheduling system kids' pediatrician, list COVID vaccines yet.

I take look CVS, seems vaccine booking system (or completely appointments). Yes wanted sure right. New Zealand allowing infection people quarantine hotels? even happen? still wear masks wears masks public transit grocery store

Glad cleared up. Thank first responders RESPONDING, making vaccine agenda. think deer getting people. spread disease among quickly. So, one thought brought article: deer spreading deer via aerosols mechanism? *Because would outdoors aerosol transmission rapid clip* Yep, understand wanting get asap probably get harder harder get spot while, school gets done inside cold, holiday travel ramps up, families packed house gets colder. I'd get phone start calling anyone could think of, starting doctors places listed near site. might want post Floridacoronavirus Yes! antibodies she’s get big deal she’s getting early likely keep becoming serious illness.  could take vitamin that’s likely matter much, all, point.

People, give us insight future, COVID still cause many waves years come, vaccinations keep deaths low tolerable level, rendering COVID background nuisance.

This also seen UK, spite high COVID cases, deaths plummeted tenfold current wave comparison previous one.

I'm Thailand getting one really difficult without connections. Usually company pay vaccine.  Why?  problem undecided, large majority unvaccinated much decided become vaccinated. Germany huge cultural problem regarding medicine get fix new government. perhaps read law passed 1988
“ According 42 U.S. Code § 300aa–22, ""No vaccine manufacturer shall liable civil action damages arising vaccine-related injury death associated administration vaccine October 1, 1988, injury death resulted side effects unavoidable even though vaccine properly prepared accompanied proper directions warnings.”

This also established National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) allow compensation vaccine injury.

All vaccines risk. administering whole population significant number people though still far less injury illness causes vaccines prevent. That’s key component evaluating vaccines approval. 

So vaccines provide strong net benefit society result far less death disease. want vaccines less. don’t provide liability protection vaccines developed. It’s conspiracy help vaccine companies. It’s common sense public policy encourage development vaccines save millions lives. 

The Covid vaccine saving millions lives. going vaccines prevent many, perhaps most, types cancer 20 years. would happen without liability protection. argument vaccines would prohibitively expensive developed all. really hit nail comment  got appointment Saturday Walgreen's think can't get worse, go say something like that, **and totally redeem yourself!!!** Got appointment 2nd grader tomorrow Also: ""The UK also donate 20 million Janssen doses ordered Government COVAX.

Indigenous leaders around country pushed hard vaccinate communities, knowing Covid disproportionate effect Native American people, highest vaccination rate United States, according Centers Disease Control Prevention. 
 
Despite successes overcoming mistrust federal government inoculating hard-to-reach communities, Navajo highly vaccinated tribes find experiencing yet another virus surge. 
 
In addition Navajo Nation Arizona, New Mexico Utah, Indian Health Service said Friday seeing “intermittent” increases Billings area, covering Montana Wyoming, Great Plains area, covering Dakotas, Nebraska Iowa. said tribal communities — though tend high vaccination rates — affected surrounding states communities, may much lower vaccination rates. 
 
Many tribal members also commute work urban areas border towns, may higher risk exposure. 
 
The Blackfeet Nation Montana, vaccinated nearly every eligible member, experienced spike August recording cases weeks. tribe, confident successful vaccination campaign, voted welcome back tourists reopening roads eastern section popular Glacier National Park. Cases running relatively high among Blackfeet virus surges throughout Montana, vaccination rates counties surrounding reservation low 38 percent. 
 
In Minnesota, White Earth Nation, 60 percent eligible members vaccinated, recently recorded highest-ever surge daily cases, said Ed Snetsinger, tribe’s emergency manager. 
 
As Navajo, officials said latest spike less severe nation’s first two, came last winter spring 2020, 70 percent eligible members vaccinated. 
 
The nation exceeded 100 confirmed cases day several times recently, according tribal data. Confirmed cases peaked almost 400 day winter, reached low point single digits June July. 
 
The Navajo Nation largest U.S. tribe, official enrollment nearly 400,000 members May. 
 
Jonathan Nez, president Navajo Nation, said members brought virus back reservation visiting neighboring communities Arizona New Mexico, looser Covid regulations tribe does. Navajo required wear masks public since April last year, indoors out, outdoor mandate surrounding areas. 
 
“We multigeneration families living one roof, someone brings Covid home, spreads quickly house,” Mr. Nez said interview last week. 
 
While tribes largely successful vaccinating members, pockets people continue resist getting shots, said Dr. Mary Owen, director Center American Indian Minority Health University Minnesota medical school president Association American Indian Physicians. 
 
“These pockets seem greater 17- 45-year-old range,” said Dr. Owen, Tlingit. “From I’m hearing I’m seeing clinic, people age group greater sense invincibility also seem relying social media news vaccine.”

For safe, can't safely job, that's sick. Well, children workplaces, first all. also unknown future issues getting covid, along whole lot known issues it. available evidence suggests vaccines safe, outweigh alternative everyone getting covid. 

Or, know, everyone could buckled like New Zealand actually take necessary action get rid virus. anti-vax crowd anti-mask anti-shut crowd, quite frankly, opinions little way legitimacy.

Moreover, areas referred above, mask mandates largely cursory, people throw fit wearing small, extremist minority. people already voluntarily begun wearing masks indoor public spaces (with exception particularly conservative areas). Won’t wearing mask always make sense though then? Covid never goes away vaccines never 100% effective preventing infection, would anybody ever stop wearing mask? Sure right higher chance catching time bunch people, don’t you’ll still risk catching Covid rest life since always circulating you’ll occasionally contact it. It’s barely noticeable pinch.

I well aware many side effects Covid dangers, totally correct. covid February, honestly crazy state whole world in, even noticed it. Felt like slightly congested nose one day. even though still antibodies, evidence Doctor, employer threatens fire get vax. think that's totally unacceptable labeled conspiracy theorist say natural immunity superior. let's honest - totally is.

Furthermore infuriates never heard single called ""health expert"" talking making lifestyle changes naturally strengthen immune system exercise every day little bit. fucking vaccine, somehow magically makes healthy, much might disagree me, can't inject health buddy. conscious decision take every single day. Wow, anti vaxxer that’s actually decent person! know, sound unclear meaning me. Hmm. I’m realizing right 61% actually still *relatively good* state vaccination average. guess mostly speaks how… great we’re vaccination. Yeah know people already booked later week (booked today). assume go knowledge appointment may canceled depending authorization F5'ing CVS site non stop believe Italy 3G, tests paid people.

Germany going 1G would quite drastic step although theoretically possible, even countries high uptake politically difficult, let alone FDP AfD. don’t even require healthcare employees wear N95 equivalent directly caring Covid patients. It’s straight batty suggest everyone wear one leaving home. That’s going happen. Kids, going Disneyland! got mine yesterday (had J&amp;J March '21 COVID March '20). Really debated getting Pfizer booster wound up. Hoping long-term effects :(  It’s lot fewer people looks though. skewed often firefighters take sick leave. cops protest came fucking nothing nurses. 

We gotta train sane firefighters.  faith leaders make decision makes least sense matter is.

* Mandatory 2G venues may opt current rules.
* Expansion mandatory 2G publicly accessible buildings, including grocery stores like.
* 2G mandate work, akin Italy has.
* Straight-up 1G: vaccine mandates. Pfizer said data month behind 5-11 group, hopefully filing soon.  California made mandatory full approval comes kids 80% kid’s elementary school signed vaccine clinic held Friday (assuming approvals done time). obviously schools be… less.

Signed mine Friday morning. Hey I'm 20 lbs overweight! Risk factor!!!  It’s job that’s extremely easy 90%+ time, ridiculously dangerous difficult life-threatening 10%.

I get leave Cuba, frankly, hard blame government US. Took firefighters 9/11. meant as: lots people chronically sleep deprived. Lots people use substances mess ability achieve deep sleep, routinely glass wine 9pm, ""insert harmless condition here"". vaccine works part allows body lots time work!

Yes, absolutely, strive best health can! also trust body's ability activate specific immune response--it very, good this. someone else pointed out, think you’re vaccinated don’t quarantine all. missed “fully vaxxed” part reading post! supervise 100 people. given day expect 2-4 sick (some days less, more). average ~10% sick strange. friend. gotten. alive.

Everyone wears masks public transit grocery store, that’s mandated. Bad bot first sentence simply means virus higher R0 due mathematics alone infect people. people infected, expect higher resulting number people end serious illness. numbers game. Looking opposite way, R0 lower, would expect less infections result less serious infections. 

As ""tools"" mean vaccines, masks, social distancing. things chips away effective R0, thus reducing infections. Vaccines added benefit also lowering chance infected person ending serious case.

In recent months Jackson reconnected several former Ventavia employees left fired company. One one officials taken part late September meeting. text message sent June former official apologised, saying “everything complained spot on.”

Two former Ventavia employees spoke BMJ anonymously fear reprisal loss job prospects tightly knit research community. confirmed broad aspects Jackson’s complaint. One said worked four dozen clinical trials career, including many large trials, never experienced “helter skelter” work environment Ventavia Pfizer’s trial.

“I’ve never asking do, ever,” told BMJ. “It seemed like something little different normal—the things allowed expected.”

She added time Ventavia company expected federal audit never came.

After Jackson left company problems persisted Ventavia, employee said. several cases Ventavia lacked enough employees swab trial participants reported covid-like symptoms, test infection. Laboratory confirmed symptomatic covid-19 trial’s primary endpoint, employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released August year states across full trial swabs taken 477 people suspected cases symptomatic covid-19.)

“I don’t think good clean data,” employee said data Ventavia generated Pfizer trial. “It’s crazy mess.”

A second employee also described environment Ventavia unlike experienced 20 years research. told BMJ that, shortly Ventavia fired Jackson, Pfizer notified problems Ventavia vaccine trial audit took place.

Since Jackson reported problems Ventavia FDA September 2020, Pfizer hired Ventavia research subcontractor four vaccine clinical trials (covid-19 vaccine children young adults, pregnant women, booster dose, well RSV vaccine trial; NCT04816643, NCT04754594, NCT04955626, NCT05035212). advisory committee Centers Disease Control Prevention set discuss covid-19 paediatric vaccine trial 2 November. grew America, know indoor dining overrated.

One every 51 Coloradans estimated currently contagious COVID-19 
A frustrated Colorado Gov. Jared Polis Tuesday ruled issuing new statewide mask order curb sharply rising coronavirus infections hospitalizations, saying responsibility instead lies unvaccinated virus protect themselves. 
“The patience Coloradans wearing thin keep wearing masks protect 20% folks haven’t taken simple step protect themselves,” governor said briefing reporters.  
Colorado fifth-highest coronavirus case rate country, according federal data. estimated 1 51 Coloradans currently contagious COVID-19 people hospitalized disease surpassed 1,200 — highest level since December 2020. 80% people hospitalized state COVID-19 unvaccinated. 
There fewer 150 intensive care beds available statewide, 16-county region southwest Colorado Tuesday reported 0% available ICU capacity, though percentage change quickly region’s small hospitals. 
In response alarming trends — 2,600 new coronavirus infections reported per day Colorado, roughly 600% increase case rates July — Polis weekend issued executive orders giving state greater authority direct transfers patients hospitals also laying legal groundwork hospitals ration care become overwhelmed. 
The state also asked federal emergency medical teams come Colorado help staffing shortages state’s hospitals. Colorado Department Public Health Environment Sunday ordered hospitals suspend cosmetic surgeries order free staff bed space; hospitals already gone further, delaying needed non-emergency procedures. 
Asked Tuesday intended issue proactive orders slow spread virus, Polis balked. said statewide mask order isn’t substitute vaccination. said it’s time unvaccinated “quit procrastinating.” 
Nearly 80% people eligible vaccination Colorado received least one dose vaccine. one age 40 fully vaccinated died COVID-19 Colorado, Polis said, death rates dramatically lower vaccinated people older age groups. 
“The 20% haven’t yet chosen get protected putting risk — certainly argue business, qualm death wish — clogging hospitals,” Polis said. 
While Colorado’s current COVID hospitalizations two-thirds state’s winter surge last year, people hospitalized Colorado reasons — car accidents, heart attacks issues caused delayed medical care. state’s hospitals full pandemic. 
Dr. Rachel Herlihy said modeling estimates predict hospitalizations peak later month early next month expected exceed state’s capacity current trajectory. But, virus transmission increases further, state could see hospital capacity breached. 
“As see projections, it’s going tight,” Polis said. “It tight, it’s going tight next several weeks.” Barney dinosaur? fuck happened barney? Last time checked, movie.

What’s significant many unvaccinated kids suffer serious long term cases vaccine injuries could occur. anything, data points even fewer injuries 12-18yr old group. dont claim Florida unless wanna go theme park beach.  Scientists make real discoveries Facebook conspiracy groups that! benchmarks would probably based strained hospital capacity rather vaccination rate, might directly motivating one would hope.  typical four-year-old special-needs seven-year-old got September 11. Typical symptoms special needs child fever 101 it. one symptoms I’m still they. figure seven year old get vaccine Covid. hope everything works well family odds favor! Eventually everyone infected vaccinated. ends. Third doses highly effective. 

In phase 1s, third dose increased antibody titers 2-6x higher right second dose. 

In pfizer's third-dose trial, third dose 90-99% less likely symptomatic Delta. group 11 months second dose. 

In Israeli data, third dose reduced testing positive 10-fold, hospitalizations 20- fold. effect larger younger people. Israel somewhere 6 10 months second dose gave third doses. mean appointments. think limiting factor throughput vaccine location. Vaccines effective. Hope guys blast! Bad news countries vaccines yet stop wearing mask covid gone. would make feel like idiot. Perhaps probably continue wear mask forever. even caught cold since started also beginning concerned facial recognition. Also really cool masks.  people understand none permanent.

Where idea permanent keep coming from? pretty much hear right-leaning spaces and, oddly enough, small group hardcore COVID-phobics know. 

Anyone sane KNOWS none permanent, finishing Delta wave reach bottom, things continue slowly go back normal. holdouts, large things going get easier hospitals longer overwhelmed areas.    forget US themselves, pretty much important too. booked fast here. So, honestly longer care. Adults plenty time vaccinate USA. 

“But people immune issues?” 

Well, people immune issues take extra precautions masking forever protect them.

“But kids?”

Kids 12 already vaccinated. aren’t, hope get shots. Kids 5-11 approved, start getting first doses week mask do. 

“Bu-bu-but kids aged 0-4!?”

Well, eventually approval happen age group too. meantime, risk kids, even slightly elevated Delta, remains super low. 

BTW point would comfortable lifting remaining mandates? goalpost that? pediatrician ready. site went nuts. appointment, soon would like, terrible wait. best part getting call anti vaxxers bigger pussies 7 year old niece. absolutely biggest pussies planet it’s official Like police demand kinds military weaponry, body armor, armored vehicles right kill people proactively ""go home safely end day."" Yet throw tantrum one thing reliably protect *actual* number one killer police officers.

It makes think excuses personal safety dishonest. want play soldier kill people, guess. here, radio silence normally proactive pediatrician's office (they call us flu shot reminders). state normally allow pharmacies give (regular) vaccinations young kids idea else check. No. They're incredibly effective. Pfizer often fewer side effects, metrics appears less effective (relative term). possibly due dosage, due shorter time gap doses recommended pfizer. Either way getting great immunity. It’s state. whatever want.

Except violates federal law. There's *lots* things states can't do. research comparing rather guess give better longer-lasting protection. 

I'd wait 6 months breakthrough instead 6 months second dose though. 2 kids divide conquer lol. 6 year old refused flu shot weeks back lady confident ( Winn Dixie) got CVS hopefully someone confident. military base flu shots dependants said nothing kids COVID vaccine yet.  Right exemplify inability see beyond actions truly ascribe people forced labor unsafe conditions pandemic serve selfish needs. already said anyway okay f people serve you.. pox humanity political, there's elections next year.

For state that's turning blue, one would think enacting policies likely result deaths right leaning voters bad long term strategy incumbent.   Booked. easy.  first days filled fast am, able find week several CVS locations near me. link used case helps.
 expecting wear masks rest life?  sounds like kind thing fly radar limited misuse, chronic offenders get attention caught. imagine super hard catch someone interested putting even little effort investigate. Tbh still don’t get joke. forum, provide context necessary people understand you.   Tell congress woman stop spreading misinformation vaccine. (or, tell focus damn state, rather tweeting day, every day) one likes tease too, says there's available random store click expand time available says nothing available.

I tried random zip codes cvs website found one chicago appointments available. think we'll see readily available week two. live city 8m people 86% adults vaccinated.

The 7-day average deaths is...8. report I've 3 shots covid ended. Thanks info! going eat movie vaccinated person makes sociopath, it.  literally evidence that. got appointment Sunday CVS. That’s entirely true vaccines still mitigate severe disease , also may end 3 dose vaccine.  Yes! I'm excited holiday outings. masked family trick treat event city kept pretty distanced outside, back brain still nervous hell. still mask less anxiety. also debating back regular school holidays.  Probably? weird immunity falls hard short time. personally mind getting annual semiannual shot, many probably will. kinda feeling gonna end like next 5 years (and even COVID going anywhere - social impacts etc passed). Read comment carefully sarcastic jerk. planning get vaccinated, despite apprehensions.    Booked Sunday kids! I'm excited weight shoulders. thing happened me. earliest could schedule 6 year old Monday able schedule booster appointment today. Currently cvs waiting get shot. turned away Walgreens Friday said eligible fingers crossed. got months back, fully vaccinated. I'm really convinced ""greatly reduced"" chance getting covid get vaccine. I'm confident fight lot quicker (day two really sick) adult got mRNA vaccine.

Good thing base policy anecdotal evidence. study Washington state covering 4 million vaccinated people showed breakthrough rate 1 5000. numbers bit worse Delta variant much contagious (like 1 100 high transmission areas) lot better nothing.

Of course spending lot time around unvaccinated carriers probably going get infected regardless, least end hospital.   Hospitalization overflow perfectly valid reason yea. that, I'm ok waiting bit kids opportunity vaccination. thanks. really living rock last 18 months ? People act like mask mandates shut flu fact businesses closed, everyone working home, people really didn’t travel normal life activities. least significant numbers. 

It seems like certain scientists (and say scientist, though epidemiologist) started conclusion “we need masks” worked backwards justify predetermined conclusion. It’s worst type science do. I'm taking mine... maybe worried. get shots since like newborn appointments. understand frustration. Four friends kids three rough them, really best rush it. imagine much longer. one 5-11 slated come February one point look we're now. Crossing fingers you.  makes mad people dragging feet complaining ""lockdowns"" last 18 months. dragged whole thing gall complain long taking get back ""normal"" even though they've ignoring precautions lockdowns, keeping Covid spreading mutating.

That said, point I'm going accept humanity never get shit together half population actively wants us die off, apparently.  Likewise (Philly suburbs), wide open week Saturday, that’s vax day. 8yo moon, 6yo warming hell leap. mean, I'm taking child get vaccine. wrote right comment, I'm actively looking it, nobody knew (at time posted it, I've since found appointments, because, know, I'm trying protect child).

I wish to. Yea lol enjoy wearing mask life.   said least now.. meaning probably wearing spike increased hospitalization loads forever. hate news stories make sound like universal ""we"" thought something shown incorrect long ago. like history books suggesting everyone thought earth flat 1492. completely. Wore kn95 ALWAYS vax. Now? I've gotten shots, gotten booster... I'm gonna exposed anyway, might well I'm vaccinated, right? banning ban mandate. many double negatives have?  experience, family lives different houses different cities. Pretty much everyone gotten covid including children get covid vaccine. Literally 5 family members live near tested positive recently including symptoms.

Myself got months back, fully vaccinated. I'm really convinced ""greatly reduced"" chance getting covid get vaccine. I'm confident fight lot quicker (day two really sick) adult got mRNA vaccine. feel bad putting child vaccine side effects, sounds like dont feel bad putting child actual covid19 infection chance putting ventilator?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Preface: Denmark like 1/8th death rate UK 1/12th death rate US. bad compared standards people two countries use to.

Denmark high. little better UK, Denmark still ways go. 10% behind total vaccination fully vaccinated compared UAE Portugal. AY4.2 r0 likely near 6-7, need something like 85% immunity. Also 1 6 fully vaccinated past 6 mo since vaccination another 1/6th past 5 months. think started boosters elderly September, opened broader population couple weeks ago. clue well booster uptake been.

With new contagious version spreading, restrictions, waning vaccination protection, room vaccine uptake, there's much surprise surge cases. interesting part deaths per Capita double Sweden, less vaccinated. guess cases case detection. Sweden double confirmed cases cumulative per Capita Denmark despite 1/10th testing. real difference cases probably much larger. Sweden probably undercounting deaths compared Denmark detection. unvaccinated people Sweden probably lot natural immunity. think better analogy would someone asked wear seat belt even though they’re longer car… they’re walking street. wouldn’t huge inconvenience would annoying many.

I’m still gonna mask up, understand many people (who vaccinated) frustrated. Anyone unvaccinated choice frustrated go f tho cuz they’re reason this. quick stop wearing mask got vaccinated, learned lesson last summer went amusement park picked nasty cold. delta started making news. I'm scheduled booster shot I'll protected holidays, I'm still going wear mask stores crowds things like least foreseeable future.

Honestly? hope mask-wearing never goes away *completely*. certainly expect majority population continue wearing regularly, hope becomes ordinary see people masks public country, particularly person feeling sick, crowded events. I've lot conventions past ""con plague"" thing. Bringing home cold convention exactly life-threatening, inconvenience could certainly live without. That's terrible. wonder long delay?

Covid shots children ages 5 11 years finally authorized, may take days even week kid-size doses vaccine widely available area.

On Tuesday, panel experts Centers Disease Control Prevention gave blessing lower dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protect younger children Covid-19. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, C.D.C. director, signed recommendations, clearing way parents 28 million children ages 5 11 United States get kids vaccinated.

But parents rushing make vaccine appointments likely discover can’t get shot quickly might hoped. past, shots older children booster shots adults immediately became available day two committee vote. that’s vaccines children 12 older identical given adults. shots created younger children still distributed around country.

Younger children receive one-third dose authorized 12 older, delivered smaller needles stored smaller vials avoid mix-ups adult doses. Like older kids adults, young children return three weeks first dose second shot.


“Vaccination 5 11 different vaccinations adults,” Jeffrey D. Zients, White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said interview. “This new program designed ground specifically kids.”

Mr. Zients said plenty supply fully vaccinate children age group 15 million doses already packed shipped. Friday, seven million doses delivered thousands sites around country.

“We’ll see first sets kids start get vaccinated late week,” Mr. Zients said.

The full children’s Covid vaccination program fully “up running” sometime week Nov. 8, Mr. Zients said. Children vaccinated 20,000 sites, including pediatric family medical practices, children’s hospitals, pharmacies school clinics, Mr. Zients said. Parents call pediatricians, check local health department websites go Vaccines.gov find locations offering children’s Covid vaccine.

The children’s vaccination campaign expected follow different pattern adults, many walked pharmacies get shots. Survey data shows 62.8 percent parents say family’s regular doctor’s office trusted place get child vaccinated. 34 percent said trusted getting children vaccinated local pharmacy. 14.8 percent said would let child get vaccinated school without parent present.

While health officials urged parents patient try schedule appointments coming days, larger question many parents seek vaccinations young children. parents, even vaccinated, worried giving children brand-new vaccine, especially since coronavirus cases youngsters mild.

According survey released Thursday Kaiser Family Foundation, 27 percent parents eager get vaccine younger children soon one authorized, third say wait see vaccine working. Three 10 parents say definitely get vaccine teenagers children.

Members C.D.C. committee recommended vaccines noted planned get children grandchildren vaccinated. cited data showing every nine children vaccinated, one Covid infection would prevented. Several members also said reassured safety data vaccine gravely concerned toll Covid-19 taken children caregivers.

To date, nearly two million children ages 5 11 United States known infected virus, 8,300 hospitalized. third hospitalized admitted intensive care units, least 170 died. 120,000 children United States lost parent caregiver disease.

“I child age group, I’m going take child get vaccine,” said Veronica McNally, committee member leads Franny Strong Foundation, childhood vaccine advocacy group West Bloomfield, Mich. “To say disease impact kids accurate statement.”

Dr. Matthew F. Daley, committee member senior investigator Kaiser Permanente Institute Health Research Aurora, Colo., said important doctors listen parents’ concerns safety potential side effects vaccine.

“It’s understandable questions concerns,” Dr. Daley said, speaking parents committee voted. “I would encourage talk child’s pediatrician. know child, know family, walk this.” civic duty take vaccine. cops deserve wear badge. Jesus top comment day moderna boosters approved asked 2 vaccine forms, planning drop old people know need boosters. guy behind counter warned Corporate approved process give boosters yet. said fine, planning bring old geezers next week anyway. Even knowing way inconvenienced repeatedly thanked understanding. Apparently multiple people going ballistic them. approved less 24 hours ago folks, maybe call ahead patience?

It's high stakes job crappy pay gratitude. always strive pleasant possible people service industry anyway, try show little extra compassion. Lmao, way worded. case. still carry viral loads make someone immune compromised possibly sick even though parties vaccinated. Within circle already encountered breakthrough cases individuals already fully vaccinated.  Dunno works firefighters sick time used doctors appointments, kids home sick school, etc.

e: typo  actually use vials needles 5-11. site might supplies. actually click it? I'm pretty sure NYT suspended paywall anything related Covid. see fine. Great, get hear anti-vax crowd vaccinate kids again. 7 yo totally board, least theory, planned get booster well! Same. Currently getting message trying access scheduler:

""We adding appointments you. Please check back later."" I've obsessively checking, insider info, I'd keep eye CVS's site. currently giving ""adding appointments"" screen, major pharmacies (Rite Aid, Walgreens, Walmart...) still allow get anywhere &lt; 12. Walgreens message check back later, could coming soon. I'm trying patience, long time coming... yes please. Yay! excited 5-11 year olds parents! Thx, got one! No, really isn't. paying 10 grand pocket go one these, 150 month food lot countries starvation rations, actual meal budget.

What heard exmormon subreddit left mission, got tested repeatedly going home, come positive arriving. Poor guy.   Yeah think ditching masks school little premature. course trend starts (ditch mask) would hard reinstate. Bad enough people still unvaxed unions cried wolf. likely distribute pediatricians. Best check them.   pharmacist, still making enough pay loans retire 60. mean, reasonable make 120k+. 20-30k year pay loans retirement go long way.

It sounds like spending problem able put much retirement. data pretty clear. Number 1, totally preventable illness. already vaccinate lower risk diseases. Number 2, kids carry virus others spread. Vaccines help everyone, individual. 17 month old son. He's never restaurant, grocery store, able 2 playdates last summer rates low area. I'm fucking ready get vaccinated. We're going zoo soon can. Same. held putting 2 yo Parent's Morning year lack vaccine eligibility. can't wait til next fall she'll get go preschool. good us. like 99.5% 0.5%. Big building fires fairly rare nowadays. isn’t dose though.  don’t know would go kind question, it’s let know.

I found unvaccinated mom covid. tested positive yesterday getting monoclonal antibody treatment tomorrow. also oxygen level tester thermometer home she’s staying top keeping hydrated.

Is anything else help get better faster? I’m across country feel super helpless scared. too! got flu shots together think helped seeing mom go first! I'm past due booster holding kiddos van get theirs! son hates needles also complete nervous wreck covid absolutely thrilled finally get vaccinated. Incredible important milestone. Still waiting approval three year olds, probably year end. CNN one changed it. see [on Wayback original headline matches post's title.

There's also previous article CNN vein one: ""[CDC places ultramodern city-state highest travel risk describing Singapore. Yay  it. Everything else logistics point. final boss? really, REALLY end debate now? We've reading ""the vaccine approved"" feels like weeks now.

I wanna get damn shot kids already. approved bay-beeeeeeeee!   every day /r/nottheonion day. 1-800-273-8255 earning revenue phenomenal thanks science. $24 BILLION vs quarterly earnings last year half that. great news Good. soon kiddo vaccinated (could week next, yay!) officially done pandemic don’t GAF idiots choose yeet themselves.   live it, OK target it.

But OK target it? risk severe disease death (which, due young age, small first place) slashed 90–98 % vaccination. get better this.  Donated. company 100% matched Benevity :-)  Hopefully start giving jab babies next year nobody wants wear one vaccines available everybody ages 5 up, maybe away mask expectations? never minded mask got vaccinated, vague timeframe remove future that’s poised “Mask aren’t big deal, wear (indefinitely)” certainly irritating. owe companies like Pfizer Moderna big thanks partnering government deliver science ensuring right information given people. know documented children really risk COVID complications, never careful.  also filed bridging study take around 45 days complete, maybe get access US soon. Half population wont change habits they're dying. guess learning others difficult.  78% symptoms 99% avoiding hospitalization. Right? Okay won’t  caught covid December 2020 really weird symptoms bitter menthol taste mouth strong, heart palpitations, pink eye, weird eye infections, skin issues around eyes. Got vaccine April suffering long covid 9 months, oddest long covid symptom metabolic disorder severe hunger anxiety. wearing wrong

I understand people. almost 2 years figured out? favorite older woman grocery store, mask hanging elbow. sure trying accomplish.  Congrats getting better! One thing bothering though, I'm going preemptively accuse made wrong choice, even though idea are. I'm also going conveniently forget need mask go get test find first place. Instead, I'm going pleasantly suggest reckless dangerous! only, seem forget hate science can't breathe end hospital. Even non mRNA avoidant, starting feel like mRNA (talk 4th booster) amazing is, kind first aid vaccine. Quick produce, easy make, limited single protein. seem like traditional inactivated whole virion could provide much longer robust protection?   called ""2G+"".

Also, possible restrict venues vaccinated recovered people ""2G"".

Another, even softer option require vaccination, recovery, self-paid PCR test indoor activities, ""3G+"". Omg, THANK YOU. many people apparently don’t care high-risk kiddos ever go school again. thing people offered parents like yelling “stay home you’re sCaReD!” Putin going let old infirm people die Covid, saving money pensions like spend bribes rockets.  Like people can't reasoned with? Even preschoolers.  stay home die selfish clue. I’ve trying find info can’t find anything. know think Polis authority she'd listen saying stupid shit entire political brand. problem people going clog hospitals get heart attack get car accident, going trouble.  Funny use quote. early days COVID, came mind hearing ignorant people talk COVID. said they've 3 doses. means they're risk anyone without mask. find it’s available locally? checked CVS, none locations it. also called pediatrician, don’t either. 

Probably slower getting rural areas. Guess we’ll go road trip. fully vaxxed Pfizer, Moderna Pfizer booster give better protection?     interval adults- 3 weeks doses. Protection isn’t of/off switch, benefit begins 1 week 2nd dose increases maximum 2 weeks 2nd dose. goes Let's hope so. painful get booster every six seven months. legally get declare rights first.

Freedom! freedom kill covid.

/s  thing found talking vaccinated people very, liberal city one person 20 wants wearing mask. big deal, interfere life, simply necessary vaccinated

THANK YOU

I'm tired gaslighting masks. Yes, matter. hinder communication. They're isolating hard hearing. They're uncomfortable. know people insist lying this. home cold convention exactly life-threatening

It might life-threatening you, could depending spread to. least, send high-risk people hospital. trying attack you, since suggesting take infectious disease seriously, many people think realize harmful even cold some. Even writing previous sentence unintentionally minimized colds... seems ingrained culture (in US?). booster pushed antibodies 3x higher original 2nd shot, return baseline, seems improbable simply wane time period first set shots. Ah, makes sense - thank clarifying. maybe realised context. hope deaths aren’t breakthroughs. Yeah let's hope best suspect indoor masking going required state-owned buildings least spring. Congratulations baby, get sleep arrive may ballgame awhile :0) Why? need masking depends level Covid community, vaccination rate. initially, booster program.  antibodies wane time Israel could trouble six seven months.  Rudolph something say - RTFA. figures **directly article**. ""In addition, least 1.9 million Covid cases age group, 8,300 hospitalizations least 94 deaths"". 94 / 1,900,000 = 0.000049.

- ""No, benefit one segment society, benefit society."" Incorrect. child - like children - part society. child high risk, actually astronomically low. children.


To put things perspective - risk multiple times lower risk death slipping take whenever take bath.

Meanwhile, vaccine *does risks* children, small measurable. cases myocarditis pericarditis. asking put child small risk A, protect another small risk B? choice would normally willing make, would normally say ""the hell it"" leave chance, end day data make decision.

But know going here, going enormous peer pressure mandates force parents get children vaccinated something dangerous, order protect people, **who cases RISK DUE ACTIONS**. think correct. risks? wonder know rest world? 
They basically country putting 100% effort containment/elimination (although 2nd part stretch)
Other countries letting guards (some let guards day 1) China hell bent containment?  would respond that? federal law state requirements childhood vaccinations. bad sad. GAF out. done understand science vaccines. anyone comes me, understand people vaccinated aquire virus, instances symptoms minimal. many close people immunocompromised pains worry selfish assholes. unvaccinated, good you! Get freedoms! come crying hospital intubated, die family needs GoFundMe yourself. words, get fucked. variant cannot stop vaccine quarantine strategy

Israel looks like pantsed Delta vaccine program...    Totally relate. high-risk 6 year old HATES shots, psyched get vaccine finally go places again.  I'd agree seen clear message immune system works, applies SARS-CoV-2, matters masks, vaccinations, boosters leadership, saw lack misrepresented version media outlets, avid continuous consumer nearly major outlets (mostly respected stuff, I'll check less serious outlets) seen proper messages leadership, see proper messages often niche media outlets (like Vice, Teen Vogue), seems counter notion primarily lacking media. there, universally there, easy miss consume limited outlets. wait out, wear masks, wash hands. almost there. appt tomorrow 6 yr old. covid vaccine available children, we’ve able use seatbelts airbags, kids flopping around backseat protection. realize kids high-risk right? lot extremely isolated almost 2 years dipshits country bothered anything protect people. So, plenty parents, like me, extremely relieved. Sending pennies Sandy. Yeah I’m sure madhouse, I’m willing wait! Yeah I’m sure madhouse, I’m willing wait!   I'm talking past week week (the present wave), cumulatively. bad clarifying. totally get it. 4 year old probably turn 5 approve 4. wish could get earlier. I’m happy high risk 6 year old get it. Man. flu sucks! chest cold idiots always call flu... Let us know crowded was. know first couple weeks started vaccinating teenagers huge lines.

[And schedule 3rd booster couple weeks.] US total exports still around 15-20% much EU China called local grocery pharmacy said check Friday. I’d imagine that’s best chance getting kid sooner. parents like grabbed spot could find. pediatrician offering vaccine clinic mid-DECEMBER 5-11 group. Geez. Thanks clarification. looked Oregon's mandates includes caveat ""where physical distancing possible."" looks like free go maskless park, sitting bleachers surrounded others, mask up. Kyle Reese! Sometimes would feel like fasting couple days. falling-down tired exactly general moving slow lot drive. Scheduled kid Sunday! waiting long this! *The interesting part deaths per Capita double Sweden, less vaccinated.*

I'm sure I'm reading right, apologise misunderstood, Swedens deaths per million almost three times high Denmarks 1462.26 compared still calling apprehensions. others see people apprehensive, they'll think apprehension valid, likely take next step get kid vaccinated.

Why CVS even appointments late?! wish government (the Netherlands) thought way. people don’t want get vaccine problem die something preventable!! want live life again. feel like agreeing said though 

Antibodies, one components immune response, decrease across time results people likely reinfected 

COVID going disappear 0% world immunologically naive  level vaccination helps determine trajectory hospital admissions, matters transmission itself. almost like providers caught guard.

The vaccine formulation 12+ vaccine. Unlike 12 year olds needed open appointments, dosage one significantly lower need ""watered down"" (for lack better term) vaccine otherwise properly administer correct dosage.

So providers need get vaccines delivered start giving out. agree China's numbers clearly bullshit, whatever true numbers probably going way better America's.


From worldometer now, even add additional 46 million cases China's current total 97,423 America still ahead 47,012,285.


So taking account difference population sizes 2 countries. cases per 1 million pop. numbers America look even worse.


USA: 140,926

China: 68


If multiple China's per 1 million pop. number 2,000 still lower America assuming America's numbers 100% correct missed single case.


The real kicker America ranked number 1 best prepared pandemic 2019. guys came rank must kicking every day now. I'm masks. wear mine whenever need to. I'll god damned I'm gonna wear earplugs though. I’m hoping flu continue disrupted States well, everyone putting guard down.  Also, immunocompromised people killed anti-vaxxers. don’t completely agree Polis here, still try protect vulnerable part reaching unvaxxed. rhetoric alienating further.

Unless standing talking infected person several hours, even unmasked going get it.

I really blame people showing event unmasked. (Unless combo indoor/outdoor event lots people heading inside unmasked)  Same! 5 9 year old scheduled Walgreens Sunday. I’m waiting MyTurn update tomorrow hopefully get Friday.    could, unfortunately vaccines 100% efficacy. extremely rare death, since 250 51000 covid deaths UK fully vaccinated, I'll wager older side age.

The region seems notable middle-east. Despite official statistics suggesting region got relatively lightly, might actually hardest-hit pandemic (even worse Europe Latin America).

It also confirms I've suspected long time: countries highest death counts sometimes better counting. US Brazil officially highest death tolls (and Brazil top 10 even per capita basis). that's official death tolls accurate many hard-hit nations.

Conversely, India undercounting factor 10, would mean several times deaths US Brazil put together.

Plus masks help stop virus spreading vaccinated population reduce chances mutating. simply necessary vaccinated

This gross misunderstanding vaccination works. simplify terms dice, infect unmasked/unvaccinated person closed room, virus role 8 better 20 sided die. target person masked, would roll 12 higher. everyone masked, would roll 16 higher. one masked target vaccinated, would roll 14 higher. everyone vaccinated would roll natural 20s. Vaccination confer immunity. makes HARDER virus infect you. virus needs fresh targets proliferate. everyone group vaccinated, numbers impossible virus get rolling. one person vaccinated thinking they're unstoppable sea unvaccinated, they're damn fool. advantage, invulnerable. Vaccination getting everyone vaccinated halt spread virus. Every vaccinated person hill virus climb, every unvaccinated person sweet hill coast, downhill coast right next steep hill makes much easier. People said crazy last year told stopped breathing eyes. finally prove wrong. :-P Please see reply almost exact comment. Would like make video showing horrible side effects deaths actually catching full blown unvaccinated case covid too? Hundreds millions vaccinations, billions worldwide, side effects small few. Covid bad side effects death much much likely vaccine. post locked due off-topic discussion per Rule 8 r/Coronavirus.

I think ship sailed. understand tell them. camp ""everything tell lie"", amount factual information help. politics. yeah...it's never real issue till now. Yeah. Again, strike maybe little worrisome. Covid magically springs time bunch cities? different spread occurred elsewhre. (If many cities, generally cases few). Looking appointments late night seems best way find something open. 

Pharmacies general overwhelmed enough staff days, trying go vaccine clinic doctor's office might fastest method. even manage get flu shot appointment better luck walking Zoomcare (although COVID shots)

Oh also try local pharmacies part big chain stores-- they've got vaccines get nearly busy CVS Walgreens Yeah, sure, except China probably one countries advanced surveillance tracking systems, use track number coronavirus cases, public info detailed comment above. talk shit something know nothing about? add /u/crimxona said: bad. want contact-trace prevent spread, much easier handle 1000 cases one location 500 cases two dozen different locations.  great news!!

How much protection 5-11 yo 15 days first dose Pfizer?

If happen catch one vaccine dose, reduction severity/really bad outcomes?

Obviously plan super careful, mask up, minimize contact.   Totally unrelated Americans use word more? ""I given"" sounds quite incorrect (but honestly even matter lol!) mean prosecuted right?  Yes. public info. China known openness.  spread potentially give rise new variants. I'm personally worried new variants, spreading could obviously lead spike hospitalizations. Honestly I'm disagreeing - think ways track prevent sort thing; I'm playing devil's advocate.   Funny, coworkers estimate number people died COVID-19 likely close zero, official tally 5m includes misrepresented deaths every cause mortality. England island. Great Britain island.

I'm saying Covid disappear, definitely going endemic, we're either vaccinated infected much rarer severe outcome people may less infectious, case rates strain hospital capacity drop manageable levels. numbers given German government minimum estimate. actually estimate real number vaccinated 5 points higher. real number possibly closer 74.5 per cent single dose 71.8 fully vaccinated, puts Germany line rest Western Europe.

Otherwise, agree saying. really stepped vaccinations, almost certainly lead fewer serious cases. got second shot recently too. matter? Here's deal. 23 vaccinated, risk already pretty small.

It's actually good news!! 

""PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona Supreme Court Tuesday unanimously upheld lower court judgment found Republican-controlled Legislature violated state constitution including new laws banning school mask mandates series measures unrelated budget bills."" Outdoor masking purely security theater point.  Oh good, me.

Can someone draw diagram headline trying say?   since certain professions mandatory vaccines. victimhood complex wanting appear like freedom fighters come across recalcitrant toddlers.  Thank much! I'm Oregon county announced signups kids vaccine clinics launches Friday. clinics start next week. said 400 kids day. Hah kinda joking actually good explanation know. Thanks! Thank both! fkn clue causes long term.

That's really thing happens vaccines.

The long term effects immunity disease vaccine developed.

See here: I’d say depends kid level spread within community. We’re still “high” category here, local municipalities dropping mask mandates, gives reason worry. child higher risk might consider early birthday. 

Also, Pfizer supposed roll data 2-4 group soon; go 10mcg dose, honestly, what’s point waiting - it’s days they’re risk (to least). No; *average* month sick time every single year.

That might average 6-week recuperation time every two years, staying home chance get pulling average up. What's 70-79%, mask data article people eat infected deer? FEWER 1000, said Yeah I'm entirely sure. I'll go older two siblings watch  Look again. mixing units effect? suspect know.

According Wikipedia, FDNY has:

|Uniformed fire personnel|10,951|
|:-|:-|
|Uniformed EMS|4,274|
|""Civilian"" employees|2,096|
|Total|17,321|

&amp;#x200B;

Even \~6% workforce sick given day crazy (1,000 / 17,000) \~10%? world.

My guess actually successfully determined many people usually sick know 10% they're saying ""fewer 1,000"" contract \~2,300 called off. “Upholds rejection ban.”

That phrase actually opposite confusing.  Clickbaity headlines like really need end. obnoxious rate. Yea personal experience this. Live Massachusetts, teacher wife yet eligible, President directed teachers eligible, CVS opened appointments Gov Baker caught up.  Maybe you. communication absolutely harder many people, especially masks. pretty much play translator partner every time communicate someone mask on. many double negatives honestly can’t understand title. anyone know percentage chances get common cold vs covid? Sitting runny nose (clear liquid), sneezy unfortunately developed cough. cough sporadic. Hits every often, cough twice nothing awhile - sometimes hours. It’s dry cough feels throat. Hoping it’s cold, wondering numbers odds get either? Google failing afraid it’ll hurt? gotta assure repeatedly doesn’t hurt distract it. Let watch YouTube video even. probably won’t even know happened.  Germany recovered basically vaccinated. call 2G rule Sounds like winning combo me. Looks like lot fireman getting hired.  sure hope so. Oregonian seems saying same, maybe Friday kids actually get jabbed. Call local pharmacy (Walmart/Walgreens) ask expect provide doses. 

I I’m ready bug Thursday schedule. bunch stupid fuckin pussies. going interesting see plays out. guess today deadline students sports extracurricular activities LA Schools. got 77% compliance started removing unvaccinated kids teams. next step ban unvaccinated school starting January. kids go districts independent study program.

If numbers stay district capacity serve nearly quarter students independent study program? 

The think think terrible idea. vast majority kids unvaccinated parents. going punish kids? goes going kick 1/4 kids one nations largest school system school? disaster huge number kids. poblem seems be, want fixed. still see scam Trump through. wo going fix you, want fixed?  That's stupidity trying map living things (viruses) artificial timelines. Viruses could give damn project deadlines. 

The study continues sufficient data available (translation: enough viral infections occur) establish benefit either clear risks outweigh benefits clear benefit. Maybe explain covid basically non-dangerous children age, instead scaring  ever going go back normal☹️☹️

I know lingering around long time impacted lives more.

Just sick ""anti-mask"" - vaccines widely available one militant terms felt refused wear mask dealt with. 

But vaccines, misfortune living one handful states U.S. indoor mask mandate still place state there's outdoor mask mandate. can't tolerate wearing mask length time (I worked home start pandemic mid-summer year) living ""the life want"" question.

The reason able work work group adults (all vaccinated) able reasonably evaluate risk have, couple exceptions, decided whatever risk exists, worth discomfort disconnection others wearing mask entails. disagree mask themselves. 

One thing found talking vaccinated people very, liberal city one person 20 wants wearing mask. big deal, interfere life, simply necessary vaccinated (although, again, people want mask up, obviously option. even double-mask makes feel better). Letting unvaccinated hold rest us hostage keeping case numbers elevated crazy. Yes. find weird schools already pushing updated rules shots even though fully approved certain age groups.  Yeah, people super gross. I've worked w tiniest humans (infants toddlers) 20 years, I've acutely aware germs spread since long covid. number people, grown ass adults, still sneeze hands mind boggling. 2yo children care better hand hygiene grown ups. like you, I've sick much less last 20 months; cold I've come way toddler sneezed eyeballs lol. like catching disease wild, plan keep way forever.  mean kids recover myocarditis? 

“Fully vaccinating 1 million kids ages 5 11 would prevent 58,000 Covid infections, 241 hospitalizations, 77 intensive care unit stays one death, according modeled scenario published Food Drug Administration last week. 106 kids would suffer vaccine-induced myocarditis would recover, according agency.”

So models predict vaccinating 1,000,000 kids prevent one covid death cause 106 cases myocarditis recover? ones don’t recover die?   April 2023 going call reddit counselor police me, too? Jfc. make choices; I'll make mine. I've already stated bother give things part consumerist lifestyle longer desire. Covid helped put lot things perspective, judge anyone wanting go back lives precovid. YOU. leave fuck alone wanting life differently now. 9 yo daughter pretty stressed to. 

We’d let go back theater refuses she’s vaccinated. want psychological relief much maybe actual immune response. Facial recognition harder, catching respiratory disease harder, getting bothered strangers harder. Almost everything enjoy subjected harder. I'd argue us prefer masks fun anonymously Walgreens! taken far longer expected. remember thinking 5-12 could get vaccinated September. finally approved November. do, get used it. Helps experiment different types masks. Still days bothers me, days forget on. First time put KN95, like, “huh, odd smell…oh.” took form feedback dental hygiene game. case reported historical NZ authorities.

The case tested negative NZ pre-departure testing, symptoms double vaccinated. Tonga, tested twice CT scores 39 43.  June / July 1 month after.

In September end year.

Now early 2022. adults. us go-getters, kids good Christmas Thanksgiving. add argument, can’t even remove mandates severity pandemic reaches low threshold, ever remove mandates? Face it, nervous wreck you. probably made bigger deal covid should, literally almost danger children 5-11.   Fair enough meaning beyond EUA. Yeah, it’s misleading headline.  give damn community, fellow neighbors.

 Way destroy near universal love firefighters general public. Finally! hope gives confidence people take it. Good developing countries need sophisticated storage facilities. Time doses adults, three weeks. time fully immune, two weeks. dose amount different 5-11(10ug) 12+(30ug) Product placement know. Hence double entendre mom's dental swears that's reason why.  Pfizer never said weeks, Redditors made up. Back June/July, said approximately month 5-11. August, revised 2021Q4, states 2021Q4 2022Q1.  Two weeks guys. got this! clash. Either get they're gone. parent 5 past weeks exasperating. many headlines kids finally able get vaxed. Quotes articles doctors parents relieved everyone don’t worry kids anymore. Life return normal.

I’m really happy 5 11 kids parents it’s like people forgotten 5s.   long 5-11y/o's second dose ""fully protected""? adults remember two weeks after, time doses different 5-11s ""fully protected"" time also different?

Woo! Yes NY Times excellent science writers. catch serving mission. mission Africa. NZ six weeks already contracting covid. WTF? compulsory LAST APRIL. Deaths lag cases ~2-3 weeks. complicated reporting delays Wales England regions. isn’t purely respiratory disease first thought, identified proteins put patients increased risk stroke, heart attack, problems associated vascular system,” Maoz said.

I wish people would understand systemic disease. Maybe would get vaccinated understand it’s flu. reason cop number low thousands cops applied exemptions still going work they’ve resolved. 35 cops ones didn’t bother apply. Keyword ""Opinion"" statistics, ""significant"" means ""not likely occur random chance"", ""is huge thing"". small effects well studied statistically significant, something looks large statistically significant.

For example, give two coin flips correctly predict them, I'm right ""100%"" expectation ""50%"" -- *huge* difference. two tests, error bars wide statistically significant. hand, flip coin 100,000 times correctly predict 55% time, significant (statistically), even raw number much less impressive.

I'm means claiming finding large impact, trying explain use word ""significant"". people getting shots right away easy sign easy get it. lot questions prove lot like last dose, license, etc… there’s nothing stopping saying never shot though getting Pfizer jab. ULPT though Pfizer CEO said interview CNBC today **data** 2-4 years would available ""end year"" 6-23 months **data** would available 1st quarter 2022. swiftly Pfizer files EUA swiftly FDA moves data yet seen.  

Basically said today simply waiting efficacy data. everyone survives Covid-19 get immunities. guarantee. Besides, immunities last (if one lucky ones) 3-9 months. 

There's many side effects surviving Covid-19. many we're unaware of, too. 

There study done Italy found correlation erectile dysfunction surviving Covid-19. study, man survived battle Covid-19, 40% chance ED, vaccinated contracting Covid-19. Holy crap, that’s terrifying! mom used lie pain vaccines little terrible. would first say we’re going store..then check up, then: surprise!

Now, I’m calm honest - hurt little, it’s entirely painless, it’s quick, close eyes squeeze hand count together it’s over.  I'd like job put life line keep others save.

Ok that, need take action keep people safe.

It’s logic it’s attention contrarianism God forbid people run burning buildings see things would cry take days off. Hahahah That’s possible. haven’t found happening. people work garbage trucks don’t work alone encounter plenty people throughout course day (fellow employees, employees transfer station dump, etc) opposite experience CVS. got appointment booster Monday cleared J&amp;J recipients turned away first saying seniors certain professions. clueless. think vary region/town like adult uptake has. town, 94% 16-19 range fully vaccinated 89% 12-15 range. imagine younger age brackets similar.  It’s based maturity immune system, physical size.  put another way, taking 23 sick days per year average (based 261 working days per year). That's insanity!!

Firemen work 261 days per year. typically work 24 hours on, 48 hours off. means work one three days, roughly 122 days per year. That's almost 5 year old too. keeps asking available ecstatic read breaking news popped computer working activity Still 10,000 predicted. would worry long term effects Covid kids whatever long term effects vaccine them.

Still, waiting longer 3 weeks give better protection (at cost less protection short-term get second shot). Fire them. first one didn’t hurt all. nurse jabbed second one hard. hurt! mad.  Crazy staying home due illnesses ""counts against"" children  Good you! yeah. Retail pharmacy life hell. Rite Aid 5 years. Worked front, sometimes filled pharmacy store pull big money constantly ran skeleton crew. 10+ years ago now, assume gotten worse, especially Covid mix. think pharmacists even giving vaccines yet back then. really feel them. None COVID shots hurt actual injection. fact better shots. That's part afraid kid. feel like would gotten delayed soreness. Fucking piece shit entitled bitches. Another reason left fire service behind early. shifts like 72 hours concurrently. wonder call like 24 hours whole thing? might even working 4 days row. 

Im surprised firefighters refused vaccine nypd. 2000 vs 34 seems weird me. salaried production line supervisor UAW plant, deal 22% absenteeism every single day. insane. Yea, basketball particular would expect sudden cardiac deaths Marfan's disease makes tall large wingspan, also greatly increases risk suffering sudden aortic dissection. I'm fucking happy right now! Already 10 year old's appointments booked!  Kinda like Florida, eh? can't find anything, almost like providers caught guard. take advice. pediatrician option dont yet....

Tried CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Safeway, Giant... can't even make appointment. Fucking christian missionaries….    Ha worries there, since they're different vials. Enjoy now, prepare future. comment unbelievably short sighted.

Of course another disease going come along. Hopefully another 50 years, eventually going happen. *could* happen 5. prepared eventuality better it. mean can't party meantime. 

And yeah, throw damn mask next time feel well go out. see point. vaccination effective there's hope masks anything kicking road. soon mask orders rescinded, case rate go up, though imo metrics matter hospitalizations deaths. Governments need permanently increase hospital capacity, encourage vaccination, let whatever happens, happen. Awesome! another example country reaches high vaccination level unlocks restrictions boldly announces ""return normal covid"". country finds situation *still* unbearable. restrictions, mask guidances, etc. one one come back.

Denmark, United Kingdom, Portugal, South Korea... countries found out, find out, ""fruit still raw"".

Then what? Well, one possibility — kind outside common narrative least — countries kick things notch, start go China way. Aggressive eradication strategy. know kind extreme theory, might way go found making covid endemic living normal life possible.

But we'll see. Cheers, got scheduled Walgreens Saturday!  week. Denmark's daily cases doubled experts starting share warnings asking mask mandates reestablished. Still feeling confident vaccination rate enough? It’s locations cases strict “zero tolerance” policy controlling coronavirus. Local authorities high alert handful locally transmitted coronavirus cases weekend indicated latest spike cases might spreading beyond regions. Many cities, small case count going hear 7 year olds quit school school intercoms? ""I given blood sweat tears playground third life..."" Chickenpox vaccine saves 90 lives year total, across age ranges. routinely given young kids. context, personally view COVID vaccine totally justifiable young kids **direct** benefits alone.

The path childhood mandates, happens, probably going roll similarly ever mandated childhood vaccine ever. Millions doses going **add** data shows safe effective first; much stronger evidence possible clinical trial.

Meanwhile ongoing pandemic EUA save lives plus stop thousands hospitalizations, prevent long COVID, prevent school closings, etc. age group specifically seems totally appropriate 🤷‍♂️ gonna run toilet paper again? don’t know there’s hard fast guidance would ask pediatrician. explain means? Like widespread small number? (Genuine question!).  Breakthrough cases always possible due nature viral infections vaccines. 

If reach significant enough viral load (say sharing tiny cramped room COVID patient wearing protection) overwhelm vaccines titers. Similarly, immune system respond well (for whatever reason) shots, threshold infection much lower. boosters though least, anticipated raise efficacy rate infection 90%. also try places pharmacy (CVS, Walgreens), *have* pharmacy inside, like Kroger Walmart.

Ultimately, think effect overblown broadly speaking, push comes shove, overwhelming majority people jobs eventually given in. may still resent it, psychologically, it’s easier accept it’s hands. 

Another possible factor cops aware level inessential. Like cops slowdown strike De Blasio mildly criticized Eric Garner’s murder crime city actually went down. lot don’t show nothing changes, bring back all?   Why? Something wrong Pfizer? timid Japanese old lady here.

Some doctors say sure cases dropped drastically.Maybe Japanese vaccine program went smooth short time,so,this kinda honeymoon time.Hospitals prepare 6th waves,like Osaka doing.

5th wave terrible.People 30's 40's found dead home,or found office.Hoping vulnerable people get booster shot soon.

(I'm scared person 50's,also immunocompromised 20's family) Heard local radio Monday 80% FDNY vaccinated, 84% NYPD, 91% city workers (I guess everyone else?). NYPD slightly better stats FDNY, least Monday.   People still dying Covid large numbers. wait actually instead saying ""it's me, can't behave like everyone?""

I live heavily vaccinated liberal city well, currently outbreak child's school. nobody promise be. says they're great communicating 'people bad listening' confused communication works. think mistake Putin considers ""his people"". in-group Oligarchy. masses pretense holding power like mafioso crime boss. long deluded support regime, fine, problem. Yeah I'm letting take alone shots. Since initial Wuhan outbreak, China relying open COVID-19 tracking system identity, detailed location history, close contacts every single locally transmitted case widely publicized. location histories recent cases also shown Chinese mapping apps.

In countries number cases publicized, easy hide true case count one knows whether specific case counted total not. That's extremely unlikely open tracking system like China's, people easily see whether case counted not. scroll story (way towards bottom) titled “Pfizer expects initial data Covid-19 kids' vaccine end year.” Here’s copy paste though:

“Pfizer expecting initial data use Covid-19 vaccine 2- 5-year-olds fourth quarter 2021, company's chief scientific officer Dr. Mikael Dolsten said prepared remarks ahead Tuesday earnings call.

Pfizer also projecting initial data readout use vaccine children ages 6 months 2 years old first quarter 2022.

Pfizer projected US Food Drug Administration emergency use authorization vaccine 2- 5-year-olds first half 2022, children ages 6 months 2 years old second half year.” There's lot countries interesting tbh. Israel's info vaccines continues invaluable, whereas UK's info variants valuable. 

Iran areas Brazil also serve show deadly endemic COVID might be, rely heavily natural infection, boost often enough. 

Africa areas South America continue maintain level non-Delta infections, (I assume) many countries watching closely well. US always option, though. amazed much blowing proportion. Masks big deal. Nobody *wants* wear one, wish could adults instead pouting whining. Nobody ""holding hostage"" sound like one reminder away going can't tolerate wearing mask length time

It sounds like think good excuse people accept. makes sound insufferable.  So, still mission. says working NZ, “work” wasn’t still mission work? Unless got work permit earn money since funded 2year mission pocket. many people believe Covid-19 pandemic over, England’s deputy chief medical officer said, adding worried increasing numbers deaths show “the infection starting penetrate older age BBC Wednesday morning, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said: “I personally feel hard months come winter it’s wife.

Can’t wait children vaccinated! Vaccines kids school + boosters = normal Thanksgiving Christmas Could ran spots. drug stores nearby out. make appointment 30 min away next week. started checking around 9am. 11am nothing within hour me. never stopped wearing one outside 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Unexpected benefits include told smile creepy men! Eventually, then, expect several cycles ""Things getting worse! need careful"" ""Things getting better! now."" expect go back taking many precautions pre-vaccine. think likely we'll swing ever-narrowing extremes caution abandon reach point everyone's either vaccinated sick both, almost restrictions observed, there's background amount infection people still getting sick hospitals stretched (and beyond) capacity.

With couple restrictions lockdowns might well happen anytime, that’s fine.  vaccine doesn’t stop cases. Makes one less likely get it, entirely less likely. 2020 lot measures meant reduce contact people. people contact people. We’ve basically tried replace social distancing vax it’s looking like really need vax masks get virus tame enough level live (at least now).   California indicated even kids get vaccinated, still wear masks. Masks still required certain venues, regardless vaccination status. people forget many restrictions still place schools even life seems otherwise back normal. Canada overall dominates age group compared US. interested half-puzzling maybes. State media inherently bullshit. I'm speaking live office campus State University New York system we, system-wide, vaccination rate (and students still, SUNY system-wide, (1) masking indoors, (2) testing, including testing vaccinated people (3) completing daily health screening. metrics set restrictions lifted, one even talking lifting them. fact, bring faculty meetings still people give incredulous horrified/fearful looks ""how dare suggest even talk that"" kind way. 

We sleepwalking seemingly indefinite Covid precautions university system 64 campuses nearly 400k students 40K employees, higher vaccination rate likely ever achieved general US population. 

So asking people might get idea permanent, concrete example right there. Eradication impossible   every juncture goals shifted.

WASHINGTON — Two months Pentagon began requiring troops get coronavirus vaccine face dismissal, vast majority shots, part none received religious exemption, military officials said.

While vaccine exemptions often broadly worded, requests based religious beliefs coming close scrutiny military Department Veterans Affairs, first federal agency impose mandate. likely followed rest federal government, workers required vaccinated end month. Biden administration release federal vaccine requirement private companies 100 employees “in coming days,” representative Department Labor said week.
The widespread federal private sector mandates pose test country, military Veterans Affairs closely watched companies legal experts. Across country, least 40 legal challenges vaccine testing mandates issued cities, hospitals, universities employers yet move forward, others knocked back.

A federal appellate court removed temporary injunction last week allowed health care workers New York seek religious exemptions state’s mandate.

The Defense Department granted smattering exemptions, including people already leaving military medical issues. However, exemptions, like people recently coronavirus, may soon reversed. Officials declined say many service members requested exemption said number large.

“I don’t see courts interfering vaccines context possibly religious exemptions,” said Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, law professor expert vaccine mandates University California, San Francisco. “But don’t know courts willing second-guess military.”

The leaders major religious organizations recommended members get vaccine. Officials say one actively discouraging people military seeking religious exemption. anyone seeking one Pentagon Department Veterans Affairs would required established history adherence religion prohibits vaccines, among things.

“If members military want apply one, able to,” said John Kirby, spokesman Pentagon. “And able make case.”

About 97 percent country’s 1.3 million active-duty service members least one dose vaccine, roughly 87 percent shots. Air Force, week became first division hit deadline mandate full vaccination, release latest vaccine data Wednesday. 11,000 326,855 active-duty personnel likely still unvaccinated facing possible expulsion.

At Department Veterans Affairs, thousands workers interact patients supposed fully vaccinated Oct. 8, officials taken dim view exemptions. Since department issued vaccine mandate 115,000 frontline health care workers past summer, 88 percent 380,000 employees covered mandate least one dose, falling short officials’ hopes nearly full vaccination.

In hospitals nursing homes particularly vulnerable populations, “I think point undue burden us ensure safety provision health care,” said Denis McDonough, secretary department, “at point we’re going deny religious exceptions.”
Vaccine reluctance military Department Veterans Affairs mirrors civilian society, vaccine rates largely lower without mandates. people embraced vaccine conspiracy theories fearful possible side effects, see risk virus.

Over summer, Delta variant surged, military officials became alarmed growing number deaths; fall, active duty members died virus 2020, none vaccinated. total, 71 active-duty service members died. Navy led charge vaccinations, roughly 99 percent service least one shot ahead deadline fully vaccinated end month. Sailors made acutely aware dangers virus early pandemic outbreak occurred aircraft carrier deployed Pacific Ocean. captain, pleaded Pentagon help, later fired.
There “common understanding often work congregate settings shipboard environments understood settings, infectious diseases spread rapidly,” said Capt. Robert Hawkins, leads Navy Medicine’s Commander’s Action Group. “Immunizations played large role readiness conduct mission long time, understanding role protecting health mission.”

In Marines Army, 93 percent troops least partially vaccinated. service branch set deadlines complex disciplinary procedures decline shots, including extensive counseling sessions clergy commanders.

Still, doctor give medical exemption. “It’s lawful order,” Mr. Kirby said vaccine mandate, commanders right “ultimately need readiness unit, comes something punitive nature, certainly right authority.”
On military subgroup social news message board site Reddit, people swapped advice talk resisting vaccine, offering scientific evidence refuting claims vaccines stem aborted fetal cells noting troops take far dangerous risks combat. Stressing health safety readiness always better threatening expulsion, commanders say.

The private sector clearly watching. Many companies, including United Airlines, Procter &amp; Gamble, 3M IBM, already mandates, several indicated allow “limited” medical religious exceptions. Almost dozen states joined lawsuit prevent federal mandates going forward. I'm ready puke Online Online?

Looks like CVS taken scheduling site, probably add pediatric appointments. Nah, crappy part CA   learn list like 500 disallowed keywords, phrases, subreddit names work around them. It’s pretty silly. thanks, deary, lunch think bet it, mask mandates likely permanent lot places. They’ll drop bit summer soon Covid cases tick back they’ll immediately reinstate. So, personal take, adult data, protection starts kicking within 2 weeks. FDA says starts working within 10 days. extrapolate kids, think so. OG Covid days, 1 shot gave almost 90% protection. Delta infectious sure, that’s another thing consider. Boo, got married till DEATH US PART! mean, would break promise. ;) Actually wonder that's less government messaging media messaging. masks particular remember clear how's why's media redacted everything 5 word bullet point details lost. 30% increase equal increase 30% rate.

Sounds right. flu takes worse toll cardiovascular system people think many allow rest fully recover. Bless hearts. Yeah, makes sense. looking reassurance guess lol. long term side effects zero

Who fuck claiming *that*?? Certainly manufacturers. *ANY* vaccine, *ANY* time hide behind full legal indemnity?

Masking delay prevent infections. masking actually extend pandemic lower levels -- ""flatten curve.""

Vaccines tool prevent disease instead delay. Vaccines way out. don’t know goalpost that. even did, they’re already thinking shift goalposts yet again. found recently posted outdoor stuff IG, friend portland said like “y’all don’t wear masks?”, honestly shocked, I’m Bay Area, still mandates. thought everyone chill outdoor maskless events apparently there. What? forget AA guns radar reduce likelihood target modest defense. 100%, definitely lot better ""whats sound?""  Yay Sadly doubt make difference. mRNA avoidance excuse. find another reason take vaccine. selfish want everyone else take miniscule risk vaccination protect them. well u doubt listed zero source Sounds like sustainable strategy… Thanks. Glad you’re feeling better too. *cries 22 month old* Right -- estimated 15% transmission advantage Delta. Delta around 60% Alpha, Alpha 50% predecessor. 

It legitimately worse Delta, probably lead dramatic moments say ""This wave AY.4.2!"" 

On hand, gets two 15% boosts, legitimately eclipsed Delta extent Alpha eclipsed predecessor. 

There PANGO designated AY.4.2 sublineages additional spike mutations showing higher levels growth. displaying places like OutbreakInfo Regeneron yet, definitely something watch.  got appointment set 6 year old CVS. Can't wait 0-2 age group youngest get hers!

I know many eagerly awaiting moment... like light end tunnel. course free that, I’m sure you’re aware, outdoor spread virtually non-existent, I’m sure mask much good. own! 

I always wear mask situations science shown significant spread, indoor settings. I'm boat too, almost exactly, except breakthrough early September instead August. 

I'm scheduled Moderna booster Friday 12th, unless see something compelling makes reconsider, I'm going forward it. 

My rationale lot plane travel scheduled next months, particularly holidays, feel best thing ensure best protection others. Oregon one outdoor gatherings. I’m sure it’s like US, Canada legions qualified kids begging firefighters, supply candidates vastly exceeds available jobs… that’s case, good riddance!  went amusement park fun. mention vaccinated, wore medical mask standing line rides, wore mask rides, wore mask indoors, still fun. Wearing mask big deal.

Even though case numbers live, still want virus can't choose body react it, can't choose another person's body react give them.  depends whether bought bidet last time.

(Highly recommend even there's TP shortage.)  wear mine (bay area still mask mandates), cardio absolutely sucks mask on, find outdoor cardio insanely boring. Put treadmill Netflix go forever.

So done much cardio pandemic, waistline showing it.

Totally problem, though. 9 6 year old scheduled next week, WOO-HOOO!!! recommended masks used due rising hospitalizations. Likely temporary. Portugal country list high vaccination rates (almost 9 10 people fully vaccinated unvaccinated ineligible children low risk). Denmark S. Korea decent, they're still 3 4 UK pretty low 2 3. Even then, Denmark S. Korea fine recently least. 

Portugal even peak Delta wave, Covid19 really relevant overall deaths. likely flu (still 3rd-4th biggest cause death cancers, strokes, heart disease, compared covid probably around 30th top cause death) going much bigger concern covid Portugal winter unless much successful flu vaccination campaign year. Masks may still reasonable reason, people generally consider flu bearable burden. 

Also, I'm saying tolerate infectious disease (I agree prevent annual flu cold epidemics), think there's collected them. Covid19 going way... Donated. may original plan, younger people impacted covid.

It’d fine vaccinated, hospitalization risk low. aren’t. vaxxed people getting breakthrough covid spreading unvaxxed coworkers relatives classmates parents put hospitals risk. Colorado Vermont struggling right now. Even state patients…it continues affect us. None coworkers getting kids/grandkids vaccinated, fun.    Perhaps, influenza vaccine (typically inactivated / attenuated) needs yearly boosters differing strains (not sure long resistance lasts individual strains). moderna also seem lose efficacy quickly Pfizer. 

You may correct, guess see time progresses. Given conspiracy theories antivaxxers, confident would take vaccine actually covid it. 

Don't get wrong, great point would love know more.    Well, aspects this. masks cannot shield 100%, may get infected Covid initial viral load much smaller sickness much milder. another reason masks good idea. facts don’t matter people. “feels” like it’s still unsafe even vaccines available 5 up, never mind actual facts. mean start vaccines 3+ December help too, would thought there's something difficult part 6 month - 2 years range could narrow something like 1-2 years something instead least keep momentum going.   honestly don’t care earnings.

You know who’s dying highly vaxxed state? Unvaccinated adults. lives valuable need wear mask (forever) protect apparently aren’t valuable enough make broad vaccine mandate protect them? Get real. becomes much problem take medical resources die something preventable. 

Besides, vaccines really person getting them, entirely vaccinated enough people establish herd immunity.  Accountability government - concept.
Of course ideal sort government one accountable people You’re welcome Honestly that's compromise anyway. Like I'm saying that, I'm least willing meet halfway. though, compromises, fuck mask restriction shit. Limit capacity 20% morons (anti vaxers) done it.  fair - always lie. 

Most offical death counts rely people shortly death / corpses getting tested Covid.

Which sometimes wasnt simply done cost reasons, availabiltiy tests, etc. partciular beginning pandemic (when testing capacity scarce) poorer countries.

Excess death doesnt rely tests, statiscially checks man people died country would expected pre covid.

Ofc, also dleiberate manipulation going on, governemnts simply dont want look bad respect neighbours peers. Found appointment last night Walgreens 9 year-old. local children's hospital appointments time neighbor announced available appointments Neighborhood FB group. went fast! Well case study others maybe. personally agree government's policies find interesting American publication titles needless suffering there's whole shit show going US states blatant reporting cases. Eradication ludicrous idea completely forgotten about.  Denmark little room encourage vaccination increasing capacity long term investment. many hospitalisations moment, simply put measures place reduce that. It’s literally impossible count exact number people died due COVID. Propaganda hearsay. grinds gears, dubious mainstream media reporting propaganda pictures without knowing ground reality. bodies floating rivers locals area customarily bury dead banks river. high tide boom, soil slips bodies river.

The US literal trucks filled bodies outside hospitals. doesn’t mean bodies dumped there. Putting mask walk 20 feet bar, sit bar without mask drinking drink pure hygiene theater, yet legally required Oregon Washington.

Might well make sign cross legally required point. prevent COVID19 equally. Yes, easier. still possible much strict border restrictions time. even possible restrictions truckers(and still allow pass) rules allowed stop etc. 

There even separate rules defined border regions. wife vaccinated. want get kids vaccinated afraid long term effects. kind stressful. social media, I'm (except Reddit). defense, three nurse friends anti vax. see reasonable person would think validity vaccine resistance. I've pushed BS since vaccinated, older guy community died heart attack. Facebook exploded saying covid shot week killed (no idea true not).

She fears shot fears COVID. I'm sure I'm going able work time soon. set aside time talk weekend. Vaccination another mitigation measure. enough reduce pressure health system, need others like masks. kidding? Giant head phones don’t interact strangers ever again!! fireman dangerous? Um yes. Considerably jobs. Unvaccinated people never cared sacrifice, get cross. don’t understand many people think wearing mask chill big deal. can’t stand it. obviously, certain point over. People choose much risk willing accept. I’m willing live Covid point. I’m vaxxed Covid. want wear mask every forever that’s you’re choice, shouldn’t forced everyone till end time. children vaccinated suddenly make difference? goalpost always hospitalisations. Law? No. [Executive requiring federal contractors subcontractors comply COVID vaccination requirements. 

Then there's regulations Centers Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) [require 17 million employees Medicare- Medicaid-participating hospitals health care vaccinated.

Then there's OSHA's [emergency regulation would mandate employers 100 workers require weekly COVID tests.

While none apply children, they're every bit effective law.

Federal law permits, situations requires, employers ensure employees vaccinated COVID-19. point parent whose kid died Covid contracted school going sue make law. laws protect public injury death written blood. Quarantine absolutely stop spread matter variant. Otherwise really quarantine still infect someone else. stupid. Unvaccinated people give shit wear mask not. They've already committed accepting risk months ago.

Certainly need get holidays and, likely, winter first. 5 least 6 years old protection idiots idiots' kids. except Americans whining vaccine passports, way tell truly vaccinated really want dampen community transmission. honor system work, we've already seen that. Masks still work great first line defense, what's better getting sick?... getting infected first place, masks help reduce chance irrespective vaccine status.

A time come cases low, vaccinations high masks phased out... we're yet, especially daily cases/deaths rising again. pediatrician('s spouse), speak least little! reason wait seems sample size safety rather small- like 3k kids. may rare side effects missed. Combined fact kids get particularly sick, many parents thinking waiting month see anything weird shakes sample size gets much bigger. Uhh risk? Ive seen legit death reports children getting vaccinated. I'd agree AAP said FDA needlessly required expansion trials, ACIP decided wait week meeting FDA. look Portugal Spain, two highly vaccinated countries. case rates super duper low.
