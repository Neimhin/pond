I'm totally board mask mandates long takes though take toll people mentally. distanced lunch new co-workers first time realized working months without ever seeing faces. “Study shows healthiest group people planet didn’t get sick got covid” 

Thanks guys Well also didn’t millions millions vaccines lmao hardship! true? hide it? serious illness it’s disgusting downplayed mocked flu. hope keep improving. wow. fukin guy... No, wrong. confusing export ban contract. export ban government unilaterally bans exports. place UK - UK government negotiated right buy first 100 million doses AstraZeneca; nobody forced anything country doses seized. isn’t good news want go back normal, tried last summer didn’t go well way months!

3.5 weeks. basically eternity ago comes vaccine availability projections. person gets sick responsibility protect themselves. Makes sense. /s What? can’t believe actually agree article Reason. going crazy? gotten vax? I’ve also seen reports people said cured covid long symptoms. interesting graph: 

Shows deaths vaccination status. thing can't imagine shit can't imagine shit either upvotes determine factuality articles now?
If popularly believed, true, implying. means covid really hoax enough people believe true. Republican man bad do, store kick want people assholes. serious?? Subsidize leafy greens instead grains corn.

I want cheaper broccoli. Sounds like 3 week gap got ovet COVID got first shot.

If get shot did, eligible probably another two months. UK government bought UK production. EU bought EU production seizing EU production buy. good metric... 50/100k accept flu year iirc. rate vaccine distribution going, likely I'll vaccinated well ahead friends due job. I'm planning eat outdoors myself, simultaneously questioning whether even ""necessary,"" since dining ""necessary."" United States respond things restraint. It’s one extreme other. Nothing ever middle. 20s think id say J&amp;J. chances serious outcome covid already low chance cold high. Without data back up, assume J&amp;J going knock either get infected symptoms. I’d prefer J&amp;J want go pharmacy once. Couple things differentiate TX MS:

1. CT significantly better vaccines two states: 21.4% gotten least one shot vs. 14.2 Texas 15 Mississippi.
2. take effect two weeks whereas TX MS rolled things back immediately. We're point two weeks make huge difference.
3. They're lifting mask mandate. Whether think early order operations correct, business restrictions costly mask mandates removed first.
4. Fewer essential workers eligible vaccine right TX MS CT

That said worth precise criticisms people got skis trashing TX MS yesterday. real issue repealing mask mandate. I'm sure there's case restrictions businesses really suffering half 65+ gotten least one shot we've seen increasing evidence one shot Pfizer/Moderna effective. Biden CDC set clear date that's realistic (i.e. June 1, ""the fall"") states lift restrictions going continue happen states across political spectrum. fellow citizens duty protect themselves. Got it. serious cases deaths going down, slowly. Ah didn’t see this. Thanks!  Moderna given two shots J&amp;J one shot. J&amp;J slightly lower efficacy preventing illness though may due trials performed. excellent preventing hospitalization death. find good data comparing side effects. Italy one single shipment UK everything AZ produced UK since beginning.

That's true - doses UK received bought UK, bought countries seized. last month. great, crowd seemed everyone complying mask rules. get people give hard time. Yeah, gotta make sure everybody's safe. Sadly, probably wearing mask rest life. awesome. discounting Aussie response COVID great. vaccine greater urgency countries wrecked havoc. Otherwise virus continue mutate new variants could potentially negate vaccines long drawn war. sad way view future... feel sorry friendly. type mentality incredibly unhealthy. Reality is, people like get left behind. people change attitude quickly faced medical consequences. I've lost hair 80 pounds tell experience multifaceted issue, especially United States.

For personally, coping mechanism anything leads addiction. Sad=eat, happy=eat, lonely=eat friends=eat. think case lot people food becomes comforting necessarily thinking negative effects health. 

There's also issue lack education behind nutrition healthy eating habits US. Cereal breakfast, takeout lunch carb-rich processed foods dinner semblance portion control found. kind thing taught schools aside anecdotal recollection food pyramid 2nd grade probably standard many parts US. There's steep learning curve overweight/obese US starting get healthy changes entire perception nutrition, caloric intake portion control.

There's plethora reasons obesity rampant fad diets, diet burnout, able understand can't out-exercise bad diet digress. Actually comment removed months, think I've ever posted r/conspiracy, got autocorrected convenience convince I'm mobile. sure I'm bad guy. 

You study adapt open social media, that's admission. compare apples oranges mean use tools eat them(unless peel oranges). 

Your assumption I'm disaffected right wing nut job conspiracy land telling. Hard imagine someone agrees pandemic could disagree methods, yeah? 

Obviously I'm saying obtuse still responding. Hyper literalist insist being. Ok paper manipulation title, guiding public discussion forums can't described manipulation? I'm sure tracks. 

If place open attitude two unmentionable subs cesspits. people could exposed reality would temper extremism, cure it. 

Reddit moderation nothing like influencing academic discussion groups. be. Unless society suddenly develops social skills taught elite university programs, going leave lot people behind. Imagine like this. Don’t like this.  reason never nuanced conversation sub ground rules, agreed upon truth. Quotations medical professionals, public health experts, official CDC opinions mean nothing judged unpopular. opinion random layperson valid CDCs bunch doctors. even valid appeal popular sentiments sub doctors say something unpopular. Remember gem? 

Georgia’s Experiment Human months absolutely nothing happened Texas, one ever stop think maybe wrong. drives nuts most. never going stuck like forever, take time end. true. least time vaccines rush things unlike 1918. Moderna I’m thinking well. feel nervous second shot side effects beats getting covid. bother?

So get covid... *Just wait two weeks!* would recommend incredibly careful tracking calories. there's medical issues simple science. can't magically gain weight calories allow they're cautious, they're unintentionally sending message vaccinating fifth American adults matter, talking vaccination campaign matter. dangerous. sending message vaccines. contributing way imagine they're intending to.

It's crazy really seems like *you* one sending message. Wtf. US placed export bans vaccine contracts signed. UK also blocking AZ exports. part mesmerized fascination levels crazy extremes one blossom america without stopped judged. (like TV preachers have, simply feasable France)

You Marine Le Pen need enough protect people working quarantines, airports, shipping ports, etc. etc. 

Otherwise get hand we'll another giant block people need vaccines. Considering barely vaccined 2 million people today, I'm gonna call bullshit one. two weeks second pfizer im getting airbnb vaccinated friends feel 0% bad welcomed TSA open arms.

Still can't bring liquids certain size someone brought liquid-based bomb flight years ago people don’t trust try even harder convince something usually isn’t strategy get thing. Masks important vital even vaccinations, now. UK bought UK production, EU buy EU production - Australia bought too. Vaccinations *are* leading people ignore restrictions, hardly imaginary worry. choice, wasn’t depriving anyone else knowingly, would absolutely go Moderna. Higher efficacy mild/moderate COVID J&amp;J good deal real-world use already. 

Both reduce chance hospitalization/death near zero, though, definitely don’t disappointed don’t get one want. probably mostly immune going die next 10 years anyway. Let grandma hang friends Give cattle prods please. It’s shooting someone.

Not fucking isn't. even close. fucking ridiculous take. Fully accepting WFH least hyrid schedule 100% good with. hate working office, like socializing co-workers anyway WFH allows (or would allow normal times) time see socialize friends, aka people actually like socialize around. part ""new normal"" I'd 100% good with.

That said, rest absolutely sucks. Masks forever, restaurants, seeing friends lol. That's hell. Chicago? June? I'm sure anyone would even take money right now. article two weeks ago. pull quote weddings, talks industries well.  Fyfe, founder CEO Paramount Events Chicago, large caterer staff  more 500 people, says “I won’t even sign contract  200-person wedding early summer. confidence  it  can happen.” UK blocked AZ vaccine exports UK EU. AZ confirmed this. US blocked exports contracts signed surprise increase close number vaccines shipped J&amp;J week (4 Million). Introducing brand new vaccine liable introduce lag time states figure how/where use it, etc.

Optimistic much easier give burn backlog quickly catch up! forget India, SII massive inspected order export vaccine EU. Well, bad flu year yes. see 60,000 covid deaths every year + 1:10 year flu season (roughly - based last 10 years US flu seasons). Well said. sub really needs nuance. Also:

3. Mask mandates last restrictions remove.

Masks make huge difference preventing spread aren’t causing developmental, social, economic harm like restrictions are. Actually anything masks economic benefits. would avoiding businesses much possible right going around unmasked strangers. That’s awesome, would love case Cobonavirus Israel (which religious comparable US), 94% 70-79 year olds got it. Tbf restrictions 1918 flu last nearly long. cases implemented multiple times, typically lasted 2-3 weeks. UFC trying book fight Texas now, take long.  Good info still points obesity issue. people never left normal. huge chunk people kept going bars restaurants. whole bunch don’t think masks work. 2/3s country back normal summer, whether it’s good idea not. give get first shot get second shot also deaths/million. lockdowns restrictions worked would expect countries/states lockdowns&amp;restrictions lowest deaths/million. Instead many restrictions many deaths, restrictions deaths, ..... color depended Republicans election cycle. UK hand blocked AZ exporting vaccines produced UK This.

I want ""new normal"" allows fully accepted WFH least hybrid schedule accepted. works since hate working office, plus like socializing co-workers anyway, WFH would allow spend time friends people actually like socialize with.

However like anything else ""new normal"" would entail, especially anything pertains socializing store/capacity limits. Absolutely not. Legally speaking hospital cannot stop leaving immediately, deny second shot you’ve left premises. went grandparents they’ve waited car standing outside case something happens. benchmark ""new cases need eliminated"" comes from. people say Illinois Department Public Health's website state's current policy, one point updated statement governor contradicted yet.

In fairness governor, original DPH guidance, admirable set actual standard, incredibly poorly written. surprise 1 prongs satisfied 3 months another satisfied 2(?) state reopened. standards particularly logical start with. wonder written genius fucked Fair Tax Amendment language. works fine See, argument makes way sense. concrete problem, concrete policy view, willing stand it.

At point, simple disagreement policies would provide greatest good greatest number, that's conversation have, use evidence help sift through, compromise on.

My problem bigger, fictional, idea large group people never want open up. fictional, can't actually conversation imagines 'other' something not. promotes division, kind division cannot overcome compromise mis-imagines others want.

Let say hope restrictions modified sensible way helps get back work protecting still need transition back normal. helps think it, really politicians anyway. Individuals businesses largely drives response, individuals driven physical reality virus. want know normal coming, look politicians, look numbers. answer question yourself, promise. count least half dozen states started dropping restrictions within day other. It’s happening folks... Hint: wouldn’t. UK helped fund \[not research but\] production facilities upgrades

I've read several times now. reason doubt it, information production facilities funded UK government, much paid?  fucking guy advocating nuanced look reality! Get him! mean, know articles say, grandma hears stuff thinks we'll never able visit again. People scared they're stuck half-life forever, clearly agree that's true. People anywhere near assured enough there's end sight, that's original article talking about. domino effect happening holy shit! still banning govener mansion? Yeah dude. Like reading way much “terror threat” level. 

Also didn’t help belt way sniper happened right around year 9/11 jump started whole thing again. serious here? realize much angst cause people already think opinions science match corporate desires? There's already fear certain scientists papers censored telling things certain people government want hear fund corporate donors. fear justify permabanning people might opinion like? would mods microscopes already accusations suppressing articles want add accusations? Especially right turning corner getting point restrictions eased up, especially masks.

And censor first place? heard, especially something add? understand assholes (and no, doubting mask effectiveness government mandate automatically make asshole), respectful it, allowed discuss views alongside everyone else? Makes sense, especially now! Two months recovery though confusing go away within minutes said another comment thought pillows strange know confusion lasted minute most. Bravo! Ah, someone unclear difference 90% protection 70% protection? felt like screaming void bringing things like positivity rate cases going last week. vaccine man? India using soda water Chinese vaccines Calling now: massive screaming match and/or fist fight next week. hell getting many downvotes? everyone eager “open up” completely forgot situation first place?  agree, also please stop saying individuals go back normal second receive first shot! go back normal whole soon large portion population received *both doses waited appropriate amount time full immunity*. article even notes 4th July reasonable target, advocates wearing masks distancing vaccination everybody complete.

Unfortunately, people want hear that. Yes, end sight, yet. Even enough vaccine (in US) adults end April, realistically going end May everybody actually get *first* dose, means end June reach peak immunity.

All asking continue wearing masks public time. whatever activities want! vaccinated, hang vaccinated friends family much want! please continue wearing masks public everybody (who going to) protected. People acting like biggest inconvenience could possibly imagine ruining life. Que redditor thinking ""My (intert subgroup) deserved front line"".  Mine Impractical Jokers movie!  That’s it? skipping one day 80 exactly skipping one day 18, time-wise. sounds great, miss gym much! Covid lend martial arts training...Best wishes ♥️ government source that? This. article title misleading. Superbowl official events ot superspreader. events associated were. numbers went up. surprise. live Tampa Bay. dark day humanity seeing people celebrating. fact football game held deadliest pandemic history encouraged events, led cases, led hospitalizations, led death, families hurt. would respect NFL said, ""You know what. Let's skip game year."" though? think public collectively decide mask wearing health officials give ""all clear"", likely never happen. public declares unofficial end pandemic differ region (and prevailing political orientation). 9 10 fact. lie. logic flawed =/

I'm admitting even need fact 9 10 people died Covid 19 lived 50% overweight countries. 

Even stated, countries west overweight, 9 10 becomes kind irrelevant data. can't miss fact (IF ALL) WESTERN COUNTRIES OVERWEIGHT, 90% Covid 19 deaths happened countries. 

Is directly related obesity? can't know. researchers clearly stated can't know. reliable correlation obesity Covid 19 deaths? confirm. 

If read paper, see exactly approach researchers: **all** deaths result overweight? can't tell. overweight correlated Covid 19? YES. **What it?** 

Really, could saved half lives lost Covid 19 simply food, diet, exercise sunlight, we? feel reply helping anyone. Feel like cases wrong metric basing of, no? talking about? EU sell Australia? Astrazeneca delivering vaccines payed seems able export places European factories? Fuck that. noooo problem allergies sinuses last year, might wear mask outside bad allergy days. nose tell so.  see. understand agree would good leadership. think polarization issue preventing people finding sensible middle. friend doozy case Covid Arm -- rash way arm several days. fine, second dose -- hopefully happen again.

But info anecdote. Thank you. Ohio's hospitalizations going drop 1000 first time months tomorrow probably :D [Figure 2 - symptom onset (+5 days infection) drops almost completely around day 1 - viral load positive tests (+??? days infection) drops 75% around days That's B.1.1.7 could different delays infection day.

Those pfizer. [Moderna near identical - also figure different, around 15 days symptom onset ~10 days infection - figure seen comparable data AZ.  California still mask mandate 5 years now. ignored everyone outside Bay area. original order November makes little sense, know outdoor transmission relatively low walking outside people tens feet away pretty safe. message ""wear mask, time, exceptions"" simpler gets desired results

Every known-to-be-dumb policy put place makes people trust rest policies less. I'm wrong contract referring contract. EU also funded production ramp up, gave AZ EUR 340M UPFRONT make sure doses could delivered agreed upon. 

What say Pfizer entirely hypothetical. says UK government demand everything produced Pfizer within UK must go towards servicing UK contract?

Meanwhile, far know, UK receiving Pfizer allocation EU plants. much export bans, hey? articles talk permanent psychological changes people go, people angry sub mean want things open up.

So...if things open relatively soon, think differently 10 years...does anyone problem? feels like nonsense argument having.

Like, problem tech people work remotely couple days week on? climate scientist, let first say ""Oh no!"" third month still suffering...looked pillows day amazed them, first know realised thought cool was, covering thought duvet cool cuddling me. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* says that, created ""a perfect storm"" diseases wildlife spill humans spread quickly around world, scientists encroachment natural world speeds process. outlook comes global health experts study new diseases last 20 years, we've six significant threats - SARS, MERS, Ebola, avian influenza swine flu,"" Prof Matthew Baylis University Liverpool told BBC News. ""We dodged five bullets sixth got last pandemic going face, need looking closely wildlife disease.""

I recommend read whole article, however obviously don’t care mask. Hell people advised even eat eggs easy. 2million times! don't. We're hurting bad leadership information. spent whole time fighting culture war instead informing people. I've also done un air conditioned UPS facility jeans long sleeve. legitimately felt like dying due stifling heat absurd humidity. would like two things:

* 1) Stop saying can't go back normal vaccines

* 2) Stop pretending ~20% population first shot means whatever fuck want immediately. 

The reality neither extreme. go back normal, eventually. Getting vaccinated good thing increases amount things low risk. still need show caution moving forward, risks manage proactively. Seeing mask subway mean we're ""back normal"". 

I'm tired seeing ""we can't go back normal"" I'm tired seeing ""I'm totally done matter Spring, mask, distancing, nothing"". sides need grow up, nuanced reality. Roughly 60,000 (in US) - equivalent bad flu year. 

The thing is, keep using ‘lives lost’ metric that’s entire story. 

We really looking *excess lives lost* - lives lost vs expected lives lost end day ... **most people dying end lives anyways. end day, old people die**. 

If covid still killing 60,000 healthy 20,30,40 year olds year ... yeah, say continue mask wearing. number ‘lives lost’ still heavily skewed towards elderly 60,000 year acceptable number eyes. Similar accept flu. anyone data 3 vaccines efficacy vs original strain, UK, SA, Brazil? I'm saying open up, I'm saying needs encouraging vaccines develop goals based vaccination transmission numbers reopening. really right now, he's downplaying importance vaccines sending inconsistent messages importance different health measures. lost 50 70% income last year, ruined years therapy, lost girlfriend learning shit course half assed zoom lectures. can't take four, six eight months this, overzealous politicians went fanatic zero covid plan. almost entire europe, life less free one year ago. feel absolutely transition taking place starting. straw man, several ghastly plans potentially semi permanent vaccine passports already discussed. would fine answer government set actual standards actual policy. year they've winging decide restrictions get enacted lifted. 

The lack clearly defined policy enacted via proper channels failure every level government. point needs free that's get vaccines arms fastest 65+ done risk factors death go extremely far. batshit insane. Unfortunately, think lot public health people think way. could talk experts; turns actually bag boys, access incredible range resources. Everyone working COVID COVID related policies Biden administration already elected. Many people roles working institutions, top entire academic community public health epidemiology research -- often cities Governors sit. got vaccine upstate NY, got PS5 3070. Best Buy best queue system. use vaccinations. Abbot's move, right wrong, definitely got discussion kicked high gear. suspect we'll hear lot exit plans coming days put health line enter vaccine trial. I’m weak mean, yeah doubt messaging shitty also Governors states. Elk Lodge's Chapter President making Facebook rants masks telling 6 people show wear them.

They direct access White House staff I'm sure even president. know vaccine distribution going allow everyone wants get vaccine May. know vaccines seriously reduce necessity wearing masks. 

They also know small portion population vaccinated measures likely increase level spread.  political decision. example article 10 upvotes talking rules still effect vaccines barely fully distributed.

This I'm talking about. discussion sub become pretty trash. comment excellent example people talking past other. literally one behavior one problem with. people businesses behave point them, may feel 'normal' time since things open, that's ok too. good know! last week go vet clinic guy came pick something mask on, chatted reception bit like, ""I'm fully vaccinated, mind take off?"" like sure! know technically everyone safe still felt weird like change subject... assume means know wrong regarding contract.

The UK helped fund research production facilities upgrades, return facilities supply EU first. vaccine ban.

If Pfizer opened factory UK produce Vaccines UK export fine. cannot call vaccine ban vaccines exported. hospital 9 days.

But hospital heard conversations part filled blanks crazy thoughts going on. honestly thought military spies cheating husbands nurse daughter truly believed ignoring later realised me. Two months released saw one presents 12 year old sons birthday 7th March...I stood started removing wrapping handed box showing sketchers shoes.my wife looked asked , told forgot give present.
..only tell birthday two weeks away time.

Multiple things happened often now, maybe three times week. agree, pretty misleading people want eat restaurant go date without masks put headlines like that. I’ll using air-miles airline status expires. Sending overseas diplomacy Fully vaccinated wear mask stores outside. still mandated state safe. many people around neighborhood definitely vaccinated wearing masks. people vaccinated I'll probably stop wearing outside. also hung maskless friends inside nice return normality  feel reaching. I'll grant give specifics right point out, think able agree opening 15% vaccinated unwise. 

If reasonable think could suppose mean something between. example, would expect restaurants opening much sooner point daycare workers stop wearing masks work. feel like asking black white answer recipe argue much argue about. mean, that's even last one.

me, idc, past year really going shame people overly cautious unsure/asking advice? think it's
completely reasonable ask questions like I'm glad people give best advice opinions. public indoor setting. I'm gonna continue there's mandate, vaccination open everyone. AZ cannot legally export dose 100M delivered UK, export ban. Period.  Rekt 💀 lot things people looking forward normal summer take people, money, planning. one going spend money hire people able plan.

Would like attend concert, art faire, wedding 51+ people, festival, etc.? Chicago, none things officially scheduled yet 2021. Whether engaged couple Live Nation, booking venue putting money know allowed host event.

Unfortunately, events take time plan. Illinois announcing clear tomorrow like Texas did, still going months get events back motion. planning massive festival, need permits, hiring contractors setup, booking bands, selling tickets, etc. make matters worse, live event/convention business, going need rehire staff laid last year. lot hotels straight closed. Again, rehire everyone housekeeping bartenders. 

If want actually events summer, needs plan ASAP. wait much longer, things going get pushed back fall pleasant outdoor season fall Chicago short. convention industry Chicago already written 2021 hesitant book anything 2022 know hotels vendors still going business. actually initially gained 15 already overweight is. changed things up, added exercise. slow steady.

Edit: gained 15 lbs, probably 7kg Governor Abbott may unintentionally put pressure every governor country realistically talk reopening plans. People would trust told ""two weeks flatten curve"" one year. gray zone moment outside US: risk stable decreasing Europe, restrictions get tighter tighter. Plus, scientifically illiterate talk around mutations makes lot people anxious goalposts moved again, vaccinating almost everyone deemed enough.

For absolutely straw man. Perhaps different perspective Europe. Iwasa joins TWiV recount became molecular animator, including pivot Ph.D. thesis research, value animations science, latest animation SARS-CoV-2 entry cells.

[Janet Uh, what? people sub even look numbers... like ever? Texas California Florida similar number deaths per capita.

The difference California still ridiculous restrictions, whereas states freedom. choice seems blatantly obvious. ok, fucking pay australia them. australia literally subsidizing europes fuck reimbursement Climate scientist friendly reminder pandemic one way relatively soon, permanent changes coming anyway.

RIP Polar Bears Literally 520,000 Americans dead. folks, lives come end. It’s way worse thought beginning (if listening anyone consequence) it’s hard say mental health ramifications event (not mention lingering health ramifications got Covid). Everyone forum seems think losses experienced somehow inevitable anything but. quite frankly don’t know what’s tragic: lives lost fact we’ve learned nothing it. US banned exports countries signed contracts

The EU banned exports countries signed contracts

The UK banned exports, countries contracts mean, problems arithmetic fact adults planned vaccination (as said original comment), entire population 17.2 million. said ""vaccinated"" ""fully vaccinated."" 3 million doses receiving Q2 one-shot J&amp;J jabs, making ""two jab"" argument mathematically flawed. everyone even want vaccine (since compulsory). important fact truly care debate I'm going bed. :) Bye! CA least megasites running full capacity---we pretty massive stuff. think US could easily 4m /day Agree. Like get year. sick duty protect fellow citizens can.  exactly. ....huh? ""Ben Shapiro"" talking point? sounds like well thought opinion me. Except brazil 2% population 80 yo europe 7%

That's reason many dead people. africa Potentially dumb question -- husband going waiting vaccine unless try hang around CVS extra shot end day. know people success that, I'd willing try (better doses going trash, right?) failed happen upon second shots suggested time period? Would better waiting eligible? matter much? break Finally got vaccine appointment (excited!) told could either choose Moderna J&amp;J. vaccine good one would choose? I’m 20s. Fine, volunteer someone wants give Sunday ticket Masters... that’s timeline CANADA you’re US expect June feel like 2019 Happiest place earth, mother f*cker! No, EU's contract says initial 300 million doses must made EU (not including UK). Later doses come UK. Oh dare EU place export ban contracts signed like US UK I'm going realign views important topic whiny Twitter guy happens agree me. party like 1920 Yes, 7 day average lowest since November - immediately prior substantial surge point current situation virus much improved couple weeks ago, vaccine rollout quite quickly escalating.

But that's point. Nobody debating whether situation improved. point currently 80% population unvaccinated, 10% population partially vaccinated, community transmission level know historical data cause rapid rise caseload. stupid mismanage things, could still see another spike.

On final note, 'indefinite' mean forever. would stupid remove mandate now, still clear stupid. know everyone wants decisive action pretending certainty point wishful thinking. one mere blip compared covid-19. bad. I’m done pretending like I’m sick. Wearing mask reserved sick people personal choice. Anything else Munchausen Syndrome, mental disorder. thanks. common cold also causes this. flu. weren’t concerned happening before? Nothing stopping pharma companies setting production facilities UK exporting 100% output. UK wouldnt able thing. sure hope so. 

I almost feel like death. scare anyone know body working hard try fight new pathogen yes hope turn strength point. Er... said wrote doctorate manipulation public health forums. challenged identify page discussed doctorate. Please. Quote page. 

Using academic peer reviewed community (a what? communities peer reviewed - papers are. PhD thesis actually peer-reviewed, examined, different) blueprint one largest open discussion forums creates huge problems, why? That's like saying studying engineering building bridge creates huge problems. studying English literature writing novel. study something understand learn well. That's point studying it. 

The rest post makes literally sense. Political convince? even mean? changed saying I'm manipulating narrative right (but claiming wrote doctorate so, actually read doctorate, you, thought repeat something saw r/conspiracy?) except I'm ... manipulating narrative? what... abiding subreddit's 'no politics' rule? make rule, rule abide that. exactly seem manipulative me. think putting practice something studied manipulative? 

So exactly point? removed comment sore it. accused something called it. want comments removed, abide sub rules (which write) think I'm ""manipulating narrative"" report moderators, reddit Admins it'll make feel better. That's one reasons Connecticut age group plus teachers. got rid essential workers people comorbidities defined phases mean, planning getting married year, I'd issue putting money June wedding. What's point, countries handled COVID-19 competently pushed back vaccine queue?

Australians population one highest proportions overseas family members normal times among frequent international travellers. 

Every single day border needs remain closed health advice causes immense harm suffering Australians clear path alleviation vaccinations. Oh hey list highest infections per capita! This.

Like perfectly OK discuss proceed towards relaxing restrictions bit, moving phase reopening given declining case trends. extensively, especially Texas did, irresponsible right time that.

I wish place discuss COVID nuance now. subs far ""oh we're still screwed forever, doom"" phase time sub especially daily thread opposite phase full ""reopen everything now, still careful call restrictions doom gloom"".

While dislike abhor centrism typical applied place politics, room moderate debate COVID wish people subscribed nuance comes understanding are. Yes, better place yes, relax restrictions bit, extensively Texas did, time stop careful. Hyperbole reality. adults vaccinated yet. Hold horses months. Yet America didn’t do, numbers better populated countries Europe enforced draconian measures. 

Interesting, that. Me: “young people sacrificed prime year life”

You: “young people haven’t sacrificed prime, it’s year” 

Lmao glass required different.

The vaccine vials need boroscilicate glass type glass stand frozen -20C -70C without shattering. type glass used beer bottles different (and beer bottles never get frozen). That's true, AZ selling vaccine cost. true, I'm 23 infected there's high chance i'd stuck home bed while. Whereas 70 year old nan got it, she'd likely go hospital.  US export ban UK not.  rebounded still fell year countries didn’t woss lockdown halfway through. don't, that's unfortunately still incredibly probable vulnerable population vaccinated. point need perfect solution. need realistic plan. 

Look around. People *done this*. goal set realistic -- social perspective -- date prevents worse case happening. People going wait forever. 

If clear, near-term, attainable date, states going Texas did. need convince hang short while. time, give people restrictive states ability plan life going forward. probably went school every day pandemic. wrong people? fucks sake. Spreading touch though virus masks would work case Vaccine hands anyone explain masks would required schools, especially elementary schools, places US next fall?

Good chance won't, really depends case counts look like point imo cases way communities like expect probably much point making kids wear masks even they're unvaccinated, like said huge cost kids wear person talking brought kids vacced yet (how many kids affected? Also, heard coming summer?)

Pretty unlikely kids vaccinated fall. trials right trying expand age range 16+ 12+, could get approval end summer, meaning high school middle school kids could vaccinated fall. elementary school students might come bit adults vaccinated then, especially way things ramping up? Meaning herd immunity?

Even every adult vaccinated, COVID still spread children like respiratory illnesses do. super unlikely cause serious harm them. wife pediatrician, sees plenty kids test positive COVID, small minority symptoms bad enough admit hospital. think question more, vaccinate teachers adults schools, vaccinate parents, likely COVID could sweep young students within school, harmful would even be? super unlikely harmful, need masks. likely potentially harmful, masks might still think vaccines work not? really frustrates me. I’m trying understand endpoint masks required.

Vaccines extremely effective. vaccines administered younger children, see zero reason would need masks schools. Agree. also hope brings end people going work sick. Hopefully we’ll never hear coworker coughing blowing nose day. Oh God, don’t tell that. going well. Although I’m day seven feeling like crap. that’s first Moderna shot. 

Going annually I’m sure. 🥺 Yes, watching fucking idiots running around infecting killing people gonna hilarious. Hilarious. think that’s fair criticism political all. think it’s little easy feel complacent comparison low bar set. definitely need “better”. Well would assume wrong. get 10k-12k steps day winter walking dog kid morning evening. light yoga hop elliptical 20-30 minutes, decent (above 40 degrees) kidlet, ride bikes go little 2-3 mile hikes. 

I insulin resistant PCOS. uhhh kind sucks. Ifuckin hope  1/5 Los Angeles County day! offence, Europe far densely populated Australia also continent close borders easily. Also EU vastly larger population Australia, go sanctimonious somewhere else. Also potential problem mutations.

When million people day sick one million event happens every day

Uk track every adult vax summer yet putting money future vaccines, money research make library vaccines mutation pops production weeks.

Usa, EU, uk updating vaccine studies requirements new vax fast tracked needed. New vax based previous approved vax updated variant variants need trials 30,000 less like yearly flu vax. 

I'm glad planning ahead many acting like want bleeping stuff going around around around banning even minimum risk reduction masks unless hospitals start filling person wastewater testing upticks 

It's like repealing intoxicated driving laws certain % fatal 

Us enough vax adults couple months, keep masks bit longer distancing slowly let capacity limits % region fully vaccinated. practice expert ban rate take four months get entire country inoculated. Agreed, give years forgotten about. hell that!! I’ll eat damn eggs easy! Psssh NEXT?!? Don’t eat Bacon?!  think easy selfish asshole people seem hell-bent it. Except full three weeks getting first dose. full protection.

This stupid them. worried I’d catch COVID sitting 15 minutes. It’s inevitable someone somewhere going die sitting around indoors 15 minutes getting shot. Oh dear Literally though? planning getting vaccine? way thinking makes sense vaccine People want clear message going get one far many factors play. things happen cause issues. wish still could keep least April, I'm objective think that's going end world either. already know people city continue wearing regardless (Austin), people really trying already.

I really think that's states like Florida without mask mandates relatively hit much harder, people going would anyways. ""Little impact"" - Millions people strict lockdown, half ass lockdown. Lock leaving house, unless exercise 1 hour per day within 5km home better part year.

Yeah much better rampant death sure please, shit walk park either. least tried contain it.

I personally fine going somewhere cases please minimize effort collectively put get are. way EU went though great though. add another bit data vaccine responses, got first dose Moderna yesterday morning thanks phase 1B qualification expansion. additional symptoms beyond slight soreness (nothing like pain led expect) injection site, slightly increased salivation minute two directly shot reason. One friends healthcare got Moderna back said randomly got really ill hour like week later, experienced side effects. It’s really interesting side effects varied person person. EU simply enforcing contract AZ , go blame AZ. agree first line, humans stupid! Non sequitur. think India needs Canada, makes little sense sell off. pragmatic point view, makes sense vaccinate nation's worst outbreaks first. US happens large manufacturer hardest hit (raw numbers, though admittedly per capita). India happens large manufacturer relatively cases massive size. India cases, truly believe would vaccinate domestically prior shipping vaccines, would make little sense. Target hotspots. We're **supposed** enough doses adults end May

Yeah, don't, I'd much rather set metrics forced pull rug dates set. anyone else annoyed worthless term ""doses"" J&amp;J requiring 1? Mexico wealthy fat never say safe wear masks. they'd blame person gets sick dies (of forever way masks stop required people stop wearing them. that's happening rapidly now. old, weren’t quashed. going down, there’s reason think would go low numbers stay low without addition restrictions. Now, month later, we’re stalling near *the peak* second wave - looks better we’ve failed miserably expectations shifted. three vaccines available US provide neutralizing antibody activity variants. J&amp;J clinical trial data crying loud.

All three turn variants (at worst) something unpleasant fatal. Zero exercise assume. Even completely sedentary accomplish  it’s kind attitude contributes fact UK USA still collective arses Covid.

USA UK - significant amounts population ‘know better’ 

How places doing?

Here’s article (the first came to) linking many studies efficacy masks.

Maybe share scientific evidence, mask wearing zero positive impact, terms Covid transmission? must plenty ""Lower effectiveness"" surprise. That's probably J&amp;J 66% effective South African trial, ~80% American trial.

But that's still pretty effective. ""Resistant"" makes sound like even less effective that. Vitamin fat-soluble vitamin stored fat cells. much fat results Vitamin locked-up cells inaccessible body use. fat body, Vitamin need likely deficient. issue necessarily Vitamin consumption problem requires supplementation raise Vitamin levels. virus airborne. unmasked, infected person exhales, expel virus air. hang air 3 hours.

If someone inhales virus air, lodge back nose, top throat. invade host cells there. gets stuck substance found back throat called ACE2. stuck ACE2, virus uses spike pierce healthy cell membranes inject RNA.

I think virus air pollution, air pollution kills relatively quickly, ie, 3 weeks inhalation.

We regulate emissions plants protect people. lot different.  Virus alive such. like poison commandeer host cells. Air pollution also involves poisoning air.

So, parallels drawn here.

Since one owns air, since breathe air , since anyone breathes air risk virus...

it makes sense take measures, across society, protect air becoming contaminated virus. Sounds like c-ptsd amnesia. I’ll probably get downvoted sympathy fat people. respect care? Except case threat real. one year’s time already know multiple mutations varying degrees response vaccinations. agree susceptible given priority, really want stop disease gets rid old people...never mind. point reached yet, UK plants supplied UK first 100M doses additional doses sold abroad. That's UKs contract AstraZeneca (UK) says, got terms throwing boatload money first sign supply contract. 

Additionally contract EU signed AstraZeneca (Sweden) 300M initial doses specifically stated doses made EU facilities, optional 100M could made elsewhere. 

Every vaccine manufacturer delivered, almost like trying manufacturer vaccine middle pandemic using cutting edge methods massive scale 20% time traditionally took runs production issues. 

Only EU said would never introduce export restrictions start pandemic, waited facilities built within EU production starting struggling overcome production volume issues, introduced export restrictions. 

This *will* long term repercussions global manufacturer looking build factory think twice whether EU stab back. totally normal gonna take little break year-long way living thinking 🤦‍♂️ Talk missing forest trees. going able month so? curious? Scott Gottlieb person seems good this?

On CNBC Wednesday, anchor Becky Quick [asked Dr. former FDA director Pfizer board member, whether Texas' immediate lifting statewide COVID restrictions, including mask mandates, problem. answer question obviously ""yes."" also needs ""yes.""

Gottlieb got balance caution hope correct. noted, March going weird month. February, epidemic ""raging,"" April likely ""profoundly better."" month, ""we still face lot risk resurgence."" time yet pull back completely COVID restrictions, Texas Mississippi done, soon time ease many measures — weeks, months, given accelerated pace vaccine rollout.

Unfortunately, public heard ""give bit longer"" message lot before. nearing one-year anniversary [""15 days slow okay public health guidance change circumstances change, 15-day promise never credible issued. public understandably weary year rules, wary public health establishment — first overconfident messages — often seems loath admit things get much better.

To credible, people hope influence public behavior need meet public — giving realistic guidance concrete timelines change behavior soon, right *now*.

## Excessively cautious public health guidance bad public health

While Texas Mississippi rushing restriction quickly, public health officials federal government given us insufficient guidance expect start easing up, now.

Even though 30 million Americans received two doses vaccine (an impressive feat!) still awaiting broad guidance Centers Disease Control fully vaccinated, guidance CDC issued far almost comically over-cautious. instance, CDC says okay quarantine exposed COVID long asymptomatic received vaccine doses least 14 days ago — [also longer 90 days CDC reason believe vaccines stop working 90 days, 90-day window informing aspects federal public health policy — we're telling people go get re-vaccinated 90 days.

Yet, goes CDC, positing *extremely* narrow band newly-allowed behavior vaccinating. 90-day guideline also bleeding state recommendations. New York creating another exemption travel quarantine rules, time people vaccinated, also [limiting exception people whose vaccinations less 90 days message send public?

On one hand, yet another government message suggesting vaccines good. policies built implication vaccines work three months, encourage people get vaccinated? hand, people *are* going eagerly getting vaccines reasonable assumption vaccines work, perhaps lifetime, much longer 3 months.

Absent surprising new research findings, — — going ignore public health directives tell us act though vaccines longer effective 90 days.

## need honest realistic people

Gottlieb urged public officials set date-specific targets future expect lift restrictions. provides hope public good argument continuing comply restrictions now.

""March little bit premature, think, lift everything, certainly getting glide path towards lifting lot provisions right makes sense,"" said.

But worried new CDC guidance vaccines instead ""overly prescriptive conservative"" — onerous people ignore it. Instead making seem like choice Texas-style free months tight restrictions — would result many people choosing former — middle ground keep people safe encouraged get vaccine.

## Tell people hug grandkids again

Gottlieb Quick noted guidance relaxes restrictions interactions among groups *everyone* fully vaccinated plausible time vaccines approved use children.

A major reason older Americans lining get vaccines interact children grandchildren ways recently able do. Vaccines provide extensive protection recipient, especially severe disease death, recipients — should, that's want — use protection resume closer contact relatives, including unvaccinated children. Gottlieb notes, need plausible advice mitigate remaining risk that, guidance tells wait several months so.

Our lives get lot better. okay say — necessary, want people listen along way. phrase banned. I’ve waiting 2 weeks year  ask then? reads like cowardly sucker punch. known decades high cost healthcare US subsidizes development new drugs, treatments techniques exported countries socialized medical systems. immigration policies favoring highly educated people comparatively high pay medical professions mean country 'investing' domain while.

Two weeks another spike could avoided though, yeah.  Pulling mask whenever get closer 100 feet annoying, I’m going walk leave whole time.

Will still happy get rid vaccination available everyone. Don’t assume someone wearing mask want wear one forever, haha. know members Dutch government EU, right? Dutch government conservative estimates despite (or maybe due to) EU Commission's incompetence. even know Abbot's messaging supposed be. ""No masks! still need cautious! masks, capacity restrictions! Lick doorknobs French-kiss everyone!"" course Why? would please you? remember parents would worried I’d hang friends color like yellow Orange. People subreddit saying American hospitals two weeks total collapse year now.    impossible know exact date. However make claims "" start removing restrictions achieve X percent vaccination"".

But they’re built machines built specific job. can’t high speed mini bottle washers existence. That's best effort clause comes no? can't predict productivity pick reasonable number say 'best efforts'. 

No one could sure production producing commercial scale would quite recent Arizona Mississippi done worse states except NE hit hard early course they'd among first drop mask mandates. get it. We've learned nothing.

And honestly, reason done lack time - wanting define success. That's true - due 2 reasons. There's higher chance complications vaccine older people actually catching covid moment. second they're going ""stop spread"" approach older people less likely catch spread it. issue wanting use elliptical. Even so, matter issues are. unsure process capacity go sell figured running. best incompetent management. think real problem authority figures acknowledging. Americans almost faith government institutions. People blame misinformation it, help, people willing trust misinformation government health organizations regularly, unapologetically admit blatantly lying important issues perceive greater good.

It's okay, keeps getting worse. government keeps complaining people trust them, they're comfortable blaming anyone world themselves. Eventually someone honest going gain position authority really crack nonsense admit long legacy self proclaimed ""white lies"" public health, we're going get people trust modern medicine. period blindness eyes worked process info.

Furthermore, comparing European countries different demographic profile. average european covid victim, 80+ year old man, type person barely exists Brazil. People dying Brazil relatively younger, possibly healthcare bad quality.  source? “one reputable public health bodies world wrong”. Got it. 

As far papers, isn’t like masks new idea. It’s studied many times, community use non-medical, reusable masks doesn’t value. changed thinking China able stop Covid tracks happen wear masks. that’s it, happen wear masks. also quarantine entire cities army send 1st, 2nd 3rd level contacts positive Covid case quarantine hospitals, non optional compliance. That’s pretty much extent evidence masks - correlation along much effective, expensive authoritarian measures. value use them. absolutely want go back normal except one thing. hope stigma masks remains dead. covid, stepping bank mask recipe disaster. Wearing masks plane garnered angry looks. 

I've sick year, previously always sick flu colds winter long. Much due traveling. Pre-covid, overseas least 2x month, plane least 4x week. life returns ""normal"" I'll continue wearing masks close proximity crowds (airports/planes). even shipped one vaccine yourselves, about! least we've tried share supply others. Leave mainstream media somehow portray greatest large-scale medical success achieved centuries ... negatively.

I mean success sure think eradication polio would ""greatest large-scale medical success"". EU produce export vaccines. Companies factories within EU member states use produce export vaccines.

The last administration gave whole lot fact free false promises would over. Italy's vaccines produced Italy already sold promised Italy someone else's vaccines. Anglicans think 100% vaccines belong them, made USA UK made outside USA UK, one else needs accept bullshit. 

YOU FUCKS EXPORT NOTHING TRY PAINT BIGGEST EXPORTERS VILLAINS. exponential build production, means start difficult see taking schedule since behind weeks result massive differences outcome.  still sure think UK export ban. AZ decide export doses UK provided UK stipulated number doses UK government would able take court beach contract, legal way export could blocked (unlike EU)

Ah yeah, free export whatever want, ""just"" break government contract. powerless UK government one choice, send intern file complaint local police station wait trial. excuse, shortages over, UK recieved lot fewer doses AZ Pfizer initially promised, notice UK demanding EU make shortfall Pfizer vaccine despite work EU plants main cause shortfall

You still get it. one single approved vaccine UK producing UK, that's AZ one. one, export ban get 100M doses. single one left UK, single one reach milestone. export ban.

Meanwhile EU exporting every corner world AZ Pfizer vaccines ban. Including fucking UK received millions Pfizer doses EU production sites.

So yeah, complain keep everything themselves, would complain production sites, company send anywhere? know. Maybe I'm weird, given point return complete normal, really bother concrete plan.

Like, come May vaccinations easy get, going happen quick enough. think run far higher risk pressure cut restrictions early rather keeping around long.

It probably helps school aged children yet. I'm working service industry, think bunch metrics things go back normal would really change stress levels single parent waiting tables struggling make month month right now. Competent leadership important unsure that. read something suggests true, I'd love give look.  think you’ll see red states restrictions mid april, “moderate” blue states mid may, bluest states like CA June most. well said. think people (me included) desperate (rightfully so) get back pre-pandemic normal can’t see happening. permanent changes pandemic. positive, take getting used to. deaths really start dropping think celebrate   Idk ends justify means that's moral question can't answer.  statistical result favors US give result similar since Covid deaths skewed towards US. Like this; Almost 90% Covid deaths happening countries high wealth rates. better; Almost 90% Covid deaths happening countries high  wealth inequality. thinking states like alaska smaller population killing vaccine rollout. Eventually won’t need vaccine shipments go elsewhere guess concern back thought would July shots opened thinking that. entirely depends ask. would say already can, say pandemic made realize large crowds inherently dangerous matter what. asking whether expect you, presumably younger American adult, peers able get vaccines summer almost certainly prevent severe symptoms transmission- would say answer very, likely ""Yes.""    even need pair sneakers, little active. would testing waters see get away with? Like 90% people Australia live one three cities stealing. never Australia's begin with. may placed order, sometimes orders get canceled postponed. I'm sure contract deals eventuality. 

Maybe offer insight consider theft. Yeah stupid idiots wearing masks mandate, mandate, mouth breathing inbred trashcans people won’t wearing masks anymore Gyms can’t fix bad diet. higher income can’t stop bad spending habits. can't say, commercial scale process could simply less productive, could caused multitude technical challenges management related.

I agree incompetence bioprocess team could something intrinsic process can't fixed technical hurdle encounter. literal Silicon Valley, Volunteer Contact Tracer County. seen heard first hand. Testing bit way, lot walk testing sites too. straight drop clinics vaccines, many 9am get wristband, come back. seniors always easy, places really meant local neighborhood, meant spread word mouth, local groups, targeting communities hardest hit Covid-19. Particularly Zip Code. 

I also team ""Vaccine Navigators"" help individuals contact Covid-19 past get vaccine already. already vaccinated scheduled heard fair amount ""Oh mess internet"", ""What website again?"" ""I would rather go local walk clinic."". heard barely straight ""No.""s. encountered well though, nitty gritty get vaccine gets muddled long warning question. Particularly one PEG. real reaction people might have, great examples possible things people may allergic past. think way phrased scares people away sometimes. manufacture single 250k dose batch. batches significantly larger. AZ can't gain anything, simply testing waters see get away with. Fauci stepped line said non-medical related things people got mad. keeps line people get mad.

Eventually guidelines like surgeon general's warning. people COVID equivalent smoke, others disregard it. like one understood joke all. Vaccine production like producing tin cans fixed manufacturing capacity. art getting yield right. time reach anticipated production right yield issues, since vaccine exponential build capacity weeks behind schedule means sending small part expected amount. number papers backing mask use homemade otherwise. home made ones varied effectiveness depending construction even small reduction better nothing.

The ECDC wrong conclude masks don’t work.

Hopefully get vaccines fast dramatically lower deaths hospitlisations. honest, that's definition export ban, think broad lose useful meaning. sense 'export ban', legally bound Volkswagen via contract export car - buying them. required deliver me, (e.g.) pope. car, VW's, want export drive it, guess export ban car remains place. think we're seeing many states lift restrictions ""early."" think bit [Wisdom phenomenon. assume point appropriate lift restrictions mask mandates, recognize United States coalition governments operate deal autonomy, basically inevitable got closer appropriate time reopening, states would preemptively. similarly somewhat inevitable states frustratingly later necessary.

I think we're going see least half states rescind mask mandates remove public health restrictions April. Probably more, say least half. We've already seen five states rescind mask mandates, eleven states without statewide mask mandate, one state already announced they'll dropping April. seen ""floodgate"" reopening yet, feel we're beginning end curve. interesting see who's going first it'll interesting see goes last.  kids serious medical issues die COVID

You know dies Covid well? Adults serious medical conditions. Even better, ending state wide mandate, never state mandate, blocking local mandates, Doctor dad want another source :)

It's SUPER common media strategy clickbait ""no new normal"". author responding that. sort titles make sound like we'll never hug loved one again, that's true. love that, good ❤️ agree! Yeah good point! remember pre-covid going office traveling work (one-foot-in-the-grave) sick seen badge honor...showed motivation. Hopefully culture also over. least anyone kind cold/flu symptoms pressured wear mask. Yeah think points fair. gained 10kg lockdown.

I invested commute time daily excersises listening audiobooks. Effectively reasons though, high5. That's speculative since say ""full vaccine distribution"" means. could mean anything every adult opportunity able schedule shot, could mean waiting everyone state, including children, gotten shot. mind ask still wear mask?

(only reason asking bc know people who've vaccinated / Covid months ago longer wear masks. idk feel about. TECHNICALLY probably okay still feel like wrong?)  I’m gonna continue wear masks even this. didn’t catch flu anything else past year that’s would actually happen mask mandate lifted tomorrow? like Washington ""mask mandate"" places like grocery stores hospitals would place even Governor cancelled mandate tomorrow, they're private property. Media companies disliked that. Hi AZ, system overloaded ship people state, thousands died would've without stressed systems. dude, today, expect tomorrow going forward. trendlines give great deal hope. Thank god I’ve vaccinated 6 months don’t suck Go eat indoors, go back gym local hotsprings. Others things pretty careful. live rural area limited oxygen healthcare options.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll still get shit it. matter guy people made COVID restrictions part personality, whether 100% abiding going them, argue he's handled horribly. 

Could biased he's governor, FWIW think he's one best handling crisis; especially earlier pandemic first close schools, restaurants, even cancelled Arnold single case confirmed here. 50 per 100k cases two weeks good goal; stringent CDC itself. wonder happens Ohio goes back that. read thing done Italy final packaging vaccines made Australia.

Regardless even AZ made deliveries Italy justify Italy stealing vaccines belonging Australia. example, article, posted 40 minutes course vaccinated people would stop following restrictions. exactly point, right? Even ""broke rules"" waiting full vaccination cycle complete, first dose already reduces risk considerably, looking UK's trend infections deaths, exactly problem.

But, course, Guardian always find expert, professor, say horrible scolding tone. understandingly, people increasingly tired tone. might virologists, adults risk assessments. feel tone media politicians though: according them, still March 2020 🤦‍♂️ amazing. course also zombie apocalypses start. (kidding course).

That said... software person, sounds familiar. editing kind ""code"" software genetic, small change lead unpredicted consequences. fear technology simple mistakes could disastrous consequences adequate testing performed.  Oh, ""it"" mean contract government? far know, jabs earmarked come production line. would anyone know jab produced UK meant UK? telling UK imposes everything produced UK must remain contract fulfilled regardless competing contracts place? would amount EXPORT BAN.

Meanwhile, EU implements ban, control requires authorization. case satisfied doses priority backlog owed them. It’s trite. point instantly undermined full mask mandate nothing whether vaccine effective. fact, opposite,"" said. ""Those get vaccinated could still carry virus. puts people vaccinated people remain part vulnerable population risk.""

He's literally saying I'm saying ""full vaccine distribution"" opposed opening right away 15% vaccinated. He's even saying could happen FASTER vaccine shown stop spread. options available already bike. Quality dumb trainers like CycleOps, Kurt, Tacx going cheap CL eBay gearheads upgrading interactive trainers. Mount bike trainer get whatever kind workout want. Zero effort sprint intervals. Yep, unused vaccine (distributed, administered) hovering around 20M doses since early January. past week, jumped 23M 27M today.

This representation delay distribution administration. appears 1 week. Namely, started seeing increase distribution 2 weeks ago increase administration 1 week ago.

We see first 3M administered day hopefully next days reporting (which delayed 2-3 days). Things speeding quickly! pretend half million+ deaths happen. massive spikes exactly epidemiologists called it. None happen real.

/S

You may sick hearing it, lot people got actually sick, suck up. half summer?? macron pitiful leader Governors coming woodwork definitive plans finally! Feels like there’s new one every day current vaccines fine variants. 

Even trivial figure variation vaccine. coronavirus, cancer. reality almost everyone ignores health advice almost time.

If not, would never eat burger, drink beer anything fun.  death cult mantra. It's...the incubation period virus. expect people refer span time relevance?  message obviously “keep getting vaccines open up”.

Fauci/Biden’s message “vaccination let live less differently before” tells someone like (a person lowest risk COVID) nothing would change, bother?

We can’t stay locked forever. can’t stay 25-50% capacity forever. Sooner later things open back up, best way threatened COVID vaccinated vaccine production continues ramp up. painting AZ free choice export product put sale, doses already ordered, payed, contractual delivery schedule flicking middle finger to.

They want production surplus owed EU, long they're producing owe EU within EU, see difference vaccines US. fact, US morally way worse unmet contractual quota, blanketly prohibit exports matter much produced... Yeah let leave asked prior reactions vaccines. Good luck. I’m going get vaccinated. Screw locked forever.

People saying wait two weeks Florida since September. expect governor clue virus worked. Except arguing one. one saying can't go back normal full vaccine distribution. Pretending enemy exist pubs like best. What's important percentage. getting much larger percentage us. AZ honest would delay deliveries equally. know saw article state officials said using much percentage supply future shipments could cut sure something they'll actually empty threat get states moving. pretty job someone's got it. think people lost perspective. Whether cases go back again, still unacceptable level new cases deaths, worse points last summer. need give push vaccinations social distancing. Yup, that's straw-man lot people creating. saying ""we can't live like forever."" Well shit, month grey zone everyone chance vaccinated?  initial start plants produce small fraction can. Production increases exponentially reach capacity technical challenge reasonably predicted prepared best effort protects it?

The EU released AZ contract, says point correct section then? would honestly okay kept masks tactic spread/catch diseases.  Cases even testing went *chefs kiss* I'm expose

According Bloomberg tracker, stats Netherlands:

Jabbing rate 20,120 day take (17,280,000 - 1,011,426)/20120 = 808 days. 2.2 years. one dose per person.

In order achieve end June (ie. 4 months), need jab rate 135,571 day tomorrow. words, increase rate jabbing factor nearly seven *starting tommorow*. two doses per person June, need jab rate 270,000 day. fourteen fold increase now.

I think become accustomed world live in. past, believe future, unthinkable kind stuff happen. wish I'd go away. I'm expose BS comes keyboard.  guess need preface saying wear mask everywhere required right masking, soon longer required wearing it.

The biggest reasons looking forward lifting mask mandates are: 1) able see facial expressions people conversations leads feeling connected others feeling isolated times, 2) hearing greatest able see mouths move people talk coupled mask muffling voices leads efficient conversations, 3) keeps fogging glasses even masks pinch nose, 4) breathing feel restricted times wearing long, 5) another thing carry won't.

I think even mask mandates lifted, plenty people continue wear feel comfortable, point think risk infection fatality gets small percentage effectively 0 required. Maybe milestone marker could used likelihood dying COVID matches common flu living like before. I'm sure percentage population would need vaccinated happen, least data point try get people fine taking chance before. criteria make sense end certain mandates compared ""it feels like right time"". 1b. Project soft power overseas offering trusted, FDA-approved vaccine inducement/carrot negotiations parties developing world, hedge practice currently employed China Russia. total cost far less new aircraft carrier. Newly installed Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi criticised export vaccines recent meeting EU leaders late January.

Universal precautions work, keep working.
The ECDC wrong - like wrong saying Covid-19 virus air borne.
It’s family flu virus air borne. CT get backlash like two states yesterday? think dosage eventually revisited. mRNA vaccines turned extremely effective covid-19. Pfizer Moderna probably dial strength formulas Sometimes gotta blame big guy everything ""new normal"" means we're able go sports games conventions crowds, new normal working even less old one.

If want new normal crowded conventions (say) government-funded paid sick leave, that's good thing. please, specific, I'm allergic people saying ""no crowds ever even everyone gets vaccine."" export UK vaccine allowing every country make themselves

And AZ exclusivity , right .. countries these? Connecticut still mask mandate. already vaccine humans developed early last year. Vets needed jobs keep animals safe.

We’re currently supply constrained. hypocrisy business usual

FTFY children higher risk severe illness Must flower pollen then. Even work, also amazing source kinds vitamins nutrients.

Still worth shot make go away forever. probably citing Lancent paper Cambridge actually found 4x reduction symptomatic asymptomatic infections 12 days first vaccination. short time period.

The Israeli data show vaccination preventing 90% infections, including asymptomatic infections.

And neither studies actually address transmission risk. Asymptomatic infections likely significant transmission since household attack rate asymptomatic unvaccinated infection least 4x lower symptomatic.

Transmission risk vaccinated individuals likely 10% less unvaccinated vaccine time bake. 80+% still lower 94+% stuff absolutely slammed since Covid hit.

TX state parks reservations months sometimes Putin hasn’t gotten Sputnik V vaccine yet able safely gather 20-30 *thousand* people more, long take jab (which available soon already). One first mutations 614G identified early January. West Coast East Coast variant could distinguished mutation. evidence increased infectivity disease severity seem escape antibodies. pretty quickly became dominant strain.

The later variants basically result evolutionary pressure. There's speculation variants may arisen immunocompromised patients long term COVID infections basically breeding antibody resistant viruses. really rocket science. times virus replicates, mutations occur greater chances beneficial mutation arising. We're fortunate enough vaccines seem generally still effective antibody efficiency notably lower cases. think depends death rate. vaccines effective, applied vulnerable, see massive drop deathrate soon. 7 day average falls 100 deaths per day id feel comfortable. Remember, 102 people die per day car accidents still drive. true increasing supply like US has. lot rules currently place built around limited supply model.

There's literally whole sub people eating bwlow 1200 calories. maintain 1200-1300 too. eat 1100 want lose 2 pounds month. exhausting. Neither anything positive. Agreed, also, jealous society.

2. contribute general impression back normal people may pay much attention news work bees gather pollen things allergic to, includes mold, dust tree pollens. data see state website shows today lowest 7 day average since November, dropping. slight bump last week (like saw country), clearly due horrible weather week prior. long term trend line remains rather stable pointing downward. 

The point current situation virus much improved couple weeks ago, vaccine rollout quite quickly escalating. Saying masks indefinite either weak wants someone else call end, overly controlling. recognize vaccines last step, beyond citizens accept restrictions. right, that's exactly risk loosen restrictions. comment brigaded. 3M day let’s goooooo

Vaccines moooooon I'm wondering able hang friend's house Covid month two ago. seen friends since pandemic started parents risk, we're going get second doses next week. source posted;

""The U.S. Food Drug Administration European Medicines Agency issued similar guidance."" Well, Brazil makes Texas look good. Realistically, public mask mandates continue everybody wants vaccine received reached full immunity, means 5 weeks first shot. that's probably gonna closer end June. end least sight! vaccinated people hang vaccinated friends family private much want. whatever want public long continue wear mask then. big deal. There’s actual science supports wearing compliance rag. Maybe makes feel good, it’s actually protecting you, anybody else. So, could low level virus, send hospital kill you, could pass someone else vaccine, could hospitalize kill them.

But hospitals full that's really problem? Today's Au rythme actuel (moyenne des 7 derniers jours), l'objectif de vacciner l'ensemble de la population adulte serait atteint le 7 mars 2023.

(at current rate--average last 7 days--the objective vaccinating whole adult population achieved 7 March 2023).

For lulz, check today's average 30 year old Au rythme actuel de vaccination (72 749 doses administrées par jour en moyenne) et selon votre profil, vous devriez pouvoir être vacciné entre le mardi 15 août 2023 et le jeudi 24 octobre 2024. Au moins 32 494 616 personnes doivent se faire vacciner avant vous.

(At current rate vaccinations ... able vaccinated 15 Aug 2023 24 Oct 2024.)

Supposedly going ramp vaccinations, see literally sign it. excellent news. EU countries hit worse. yes, thought deaths lower, since respect cases per capita, UK #15 Europe.  Damn Looking figures first set lockdowns worked exactly expected number cases plummeted lockdowns went on.

And achieve long term? countries lockdown proved end result similar. Yeah like right path, people getting vaccinated rate going up. We've year now, chill bit longer til people vaccinated  much vaccines Yay Still ""only"" 5th Europe. worse thought, give that, terrible people make seem... Oh know. Masks still mandated state want make sure I'm keeping safe making others feel comfortable well.  I’m opinion. soon get summer vaccines available go whoever wants one, everything slowly go back normal. imagine we’ll see small wave winter, summer return normal. Well think specifically using academic peer reviewed community blueprint one largest open discussion forums creates huge problems. Straying objective papers research hitting insults politics makes sense academic realm. wide open public forum scientific method gospel, political convince becomes ""objective fact.""  

In regard manipulating narrative allowing concerted effort entire political apparatus go unchallenged calling would ""political."" Sorry, masks work, distancing works, pandemic now, vaccine give sterilizing immunity might fall. facts, call opposing sources requires naming bad behavior charge (often political) motivations. read whistle blower reports FDA approved pharma plants India?  Well first Macron get TV tell everyone shit vaccine AZ absolutely ensure Europeans keep refusing take find warehouse use them. Lol COVID discussion inherently political point let people talk  partial herd immunity need much vaccines. Andrew Cuomo staring possible impeachment moment, I'd assume every move makes optimized towards getting enough short-term popularity fend rather sound science sustainable solutions. terms cases per capita, UK 16th place (6.2 % population tested positive) Europe Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Belgium, Latvia, Portugal, Slovenia Czech Republic (11.9 %) (that's EU countries). terms deaths, higher 5th place (182 deaths/100k) Europe, Slovenia, Belgium Czech Republic (195/100k) hit harder.

So guess total numbers, agree right hit quite bit. right now, 74 new cases/week/100 k UK 790 Czechia, 660 Estonia 300 Slovakia. people become obese without sort medical condition?

Like yes political messaging poor scheme things we'll okay. think outraged Abbott completely fine Connecticut/other states rolling back consider why. TX waited bit longer we're going vaccinated soon big deal. Efficacy original strain 95% 94% 72% (based US trial data).

J&amp;J showed efficacy 64% South Africa cases SA variant (20H/501Y.V2), 68% Brazil majority cases Brazil variant (P.2) - say, variants South Africa Brazil seem modestly reduced efficacy J&amp;J vaccine, much people worrying. efficacy numbers Pfizer Moderna SA Brazil variants phase 3 trials conducted variants observed, know lab experiments show people vaccinated Pfizer Moderna somewhat diminished immune response SA variant would expect like J&amp;J would still protective somewhat less original strain.

None three vaccines phase 3 trials UK, existing evidence suggests vaccines target original ancestor strain provoke similarly strong immune response UK variant would likely show similar efficacy, born 89% efficacy Novavax vaccine UK phase 3 trial observed effectiveness AstraZeneca Pfizer vaccines UK Israel.

Note raw efficacy underrates useful vaccines are. seems likely three vaccines available US would nearly 100% protective hospitalization death due COVID, including variants concern. Tours? Probably. never anything people wouldn’t losing minds Texas Mississippi stopping measures. No. I’m pretty sure (if all, vast majority) U.S. supplies produced Moderna, Catalent, Lonza Massachusetts, Indiana, New Hampshire, respectively. non-U.S. supply produced Lonza Vins, Switzerland.

It's really hard convince I'm safe I'm ever going be, I'm sure that's small part due media scares compounding already extreme anxiety disorder.

I went store today caught thinking ""I gotta get here, crowded"" keep reminding myself, ""hey, vaccinated. Chill."" think there's reason optimistic. Many airlines waving change fees go ahead book UK trip later year. Getting first shot modernq tomorrow! purpose waiting 15 min allergy/anaphylactic reasons? last comment. know subreddits like promote eternal doom society, believe not, everyone actually die covid, even nothing stop it. Chinese, thinks trash Trump said drinking bleach would cure it, would promoted it. 

That's he's sinophobe idiot. health minister Netherlands said expect adults vaccinated end June.

The EU making grand pronouncements since last November vaccination program none come pass.

In order get vaccinated June they'd increase daily jabs fivefold. Every day delay, they'll catch up. got logistics achieve it. would that? AZ gain? Brits fat american fast food Yes, half data OUS. It’s modern clinical trial design goes. JNJ example 8 countries participating. may so, fundamentally issue science, management issue. AZ sales management made promises knowledge whether would able keep them. incompetence. AZ management thought based advice scientists &amp; process engineers would able deliver quantities incompetence part scientists process engineers. quality comments sub dropped significantly I've stopped skimming. skepticism, conspiracy subs infiltrated reflected content. prep come back.

I mean prep want. fact politicians health experts shied away giving sort indication return normalcy burning goodwill public has. real virus American  Transmission risk apparently reduces two thirds elimated virus spreading high levels really encouraged. course make arguments old etc that's different story 2 4 since BioNTech funded German government. Unless consider pre-ordering doses, development funding.

I'm assuming leaving one Russian Chinese vaccines. Obviously Americans get vaccines, lot developing world probably will. wonderful person!  come, time. J&amp;J vaccine loaded mobile units pull shopping center parking lots scheduled days. need remember many short months even vaccine difficult handling conditions come first two. Congrats CT! like huge helping eating beef, pork, butter 24/7 think J&amp;J would better though since single dose. Bottles sterilized filled quite different maintaining sterilize environment. cross reference flu ifr estimated covid ifr (the UK fairly good estimates) 0-18 year olds. though remember covid equal flu demographic. Fauci awfully close saying it.

This projection. People hearing things based imagine people different political persuasions contempt expertise general. Florida: *You guys wearing masks?* I'd much prefer new normal. old one really working. right. Would agree North Dakota South Dakota comparable populations/climate/density etc?

One mask mandate restrictions, one didn't.

Similar case-rate, little difference overall covid trajectory.

Would agree mask mandates restrictions completely useless? There's similar state-by-state comparisons across thee midwest similar population varying levels restrictions, end overall similar covid case trajectory. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* twenty percent people, adults, Connecticut gotten least one vaccine dose. almost certainly going past fifty percent month.

I think pulling back restrictions sends good message. tells people strong vaccination campaign means return normalcy. feel that's message that's going make people root vaccine want get themselves.

I understand Fauci Biden cautious pulling back restrictions, especially dramatic pull backs like Texas Mississippi, calling people Neanderthals saying inexplicable want normal lives back really send message feel imagine does.

Yes, they're cautious, they're unintentionally sending message vaccinating fifth American adults matter, talking vaccination campaign *will* matter. dangerous. sending message vaccines. contributing way imagine they're intending to. brewer sterilization essential beer. Bacterial wild yeast ruin brew. product rely sterile packaging. difference capping methodology fragility glass. Finally number 1 something-covid-related horrific. weren't. If. already know since takes 10 seconds find out. Spoiler: stupid calling *inside* state. I'm going cite page numbers give 24 hours high light make list. 12mb pdf. 

In interim I'll link it: others read it, might also see playbook moderation style here. total straw-man argument. That's anyone saying shows either profound lack understanding outright bad faith effort rage machine say otherwise.

If think think able go back normal full vaccine distribution, understand fellow man. may happen speed want, may happen everywhere time, may require masks places get children vaccinated, small chance require extra booster make happen, happen. one, literally fucking one, saying years.

Stop getting hate boners, enemies here. tolerate fullfilling countries orders literally laugh face token delieries last minute cancellations?  Australia developed biomedical industries manufactured vaccine. kind argument. Chicago, vaccine slots 65s filled. hubris think design better vaccine God Himself. kidding sounds dope. Unfortunately US country trying inform people \*is\* culture war. Cause Australia thing things reversed. mutation found States sooner definitive answer vaccines respond it. hold, basically game normalcy right around corner. like you. US draconian China New Zealand-style lockdowns; that's true. However, ridiculous claim nothing different 2019 here. aspects life dramatically different many populous parts country. you’ve reached maximum immunity feel really really safe outdoors. data shows transmission outdoors minimal even without vaccination That’s great!

I hate stop wearing soon allowed. 'playbook' moderation style - I'm denying that. Challenge misinformation. Remove incorrect misleading information. Signpost users towards high-quality information. 

Manipulating narrative? Waiting page numbers. Go ahead post found it. called upon sit upon sofa months.

Shows touch are. I'm sure work struggling bills bunch whiners right references three vaccines used US. work fine variants. Clearly production capacity, much AZ using produce vaccines ship abroad... tendies... stuff way complicated scientific. I'd much rather make fun blame everything one guy saw walmart without mask last month like politicians told do. We're supposed enough doses adults end May. time set date, metrics. might able convince people go symbolic July 4th, honestly June 1 would reasonable opinion. trying bring cases zero, trying preserve health care capacity. end May, latest, elderly highest risk population vaccinated. I’m used seeing people spell things incorrectly inside comments section. pathetic though. Patients different patience. Smh could walk around metal keys coins pockets? everyone constantly jingling? Brilliant move. EU needs find warehouse use them. don’t care people decide this, don’t hand sanitizers. Others wear masks everywhere rest lives, long don’t try make same. care mandates restrictions lifted, metrics used determine lift them. real number 120k, no?

And that's really number I'm asking for, though, unlikely save anywhere near 60k bad flu season masks. Similar story COVID deaths years. really can’t express enough damaging whole “we’ll masking rest year” shit is. one day wish Ohio. supply eu sold higher bidder. time. Evil. agree vaccinations put hard time limit long pandemic go for, cases deaths really dropped past week. hand hospitalizations dropped like rock time continuing to, guess metric could understand argument more.

idk, I'm really disagreeing much, seat someone managing pandemic guess would cautious try make predictions far future. I'm firmly side Massachusetts practically back normal summer, can't imagine Baker going public 70+ percent state vaccinated. thought wanted save lives? Yup, Los Angeles checking well. 8/10 joggers also masks. 10/10 walkers do. time I've gone unmasked since last March probably walking park past 8:30pm, grand total 10 people park. This.

Texas governor lifting mask mandate less 25% population vaccinated begging deaths 300lb roller skaters follow instagram would never lie me!! Daily new cases Mass stopped dropping past week moving average 1,500 per day. That's looked like early November immediately prior largest spike yet.

Furthermore, 20% population gotten vaccine. one dose. think problem “normal, eventually” isn’t good enough year restrictions. need clear metrics goals reaching actual normal. something along lines ‘eventually, maybe fall, may reach semblance normality’, need either thresholds lifting restrictions timeline so. really hate intense desire vaccine made feel competitive it. Like I'm essential worker working public since started found really bitter people able social distance able work home able get shot me. fault. Anyway, got first dose days ago, actually way sooner expected (NC started vaccinating essential workers week). much this. I'm sick seeing people sub acting like everything going back normal cases vaccines happening. yet, get closer closer ""there"" every single day clearly fucking measurable way. wait it. equally understand they're coming from, reason non-insignificant number ""experts"" talking bullshit never go back normal even post-vaccine, they're probably mostly pushing back hard that. export would legal doses specific factories 100M mark factories delivered UK would breach contract. came another factory owned AZ licence holder contractual issues either. Either AZ licence holder could set another factory UK factory could export first dose without contractual issues.

Would characterise contract EU AZ also bring export ban? contacts fairly similar apart doses counted contract (the UK one first x doses EU one X doses date). either constitute export ban not, given EU enacted specific powers allow block export vaccines implies export ban. numbers incorrect 1,470,623 doses/8.42 per 100 administered average 40-60k per day last week two.

Fair enough. still 17.28 million people Netherlands, adjusts figures two weeks.

It literally impossible Netherlands hit target two doses per person end June unless least 250,000 jabs day **starting tomorrow**.

We know start tomorrow 250,000 day. They're incapable it, they've pfaffing around hardly anything months due laziness.

So yes - EU union incompetent plague countries. 

Fantasising suddenly get competent start jabbing target June ""conservative"" laughable. defying laws arithmetic.

Every day 250,000 day target, take even longer. predict EU pandemic year. Big pharma companies hate EU. combine power block negotiate prices drop lot. UK overpays gets boatload earlier. expect lot vaccine warfare coming. words Lil Jon:  “YEAH!!!!” Like space race, US tumbles struggles start US hits stride, it’s powerful force. can't plan based required metrics opening,though.

""Concerts 5000+ people allowed cases Y"" really help regards. literally lol Shots arm = shots bar! Brazil even gotten better economy let get covid strategy fun fun spreads covid anything. havent heard Dr Offit...
He suggesting wear masks every right. Next level fuckery. “back normal” Americans? Y’all never even anything try stop spread. 

I suppose back normal would LESS social gatherings.  really, America doubled mRNA, Canada. EU spread risk around bunch potential vaccines, fact July last year Pfizer offered EU additional contract 500m doses EU turned down. 

The problem EU ordered enough doses 3.5 times population, US UK around 6, Canada went 8 9, countries lower. Unfortunately French Sanofi candidate they'd ordered 300m doses failed trial, others took longer get going. 

The couple promising vaccines (Pfizer Oxford-AstraZeneca) fast successful phase iii trial comprised 2 times EU population i.e. enough got everything. suffered major production shortages suddenly EU faced getting small percentage orders. 

And that's EU screwed tried litigate way rather try fix problem accept going delay. AZ mistake, EU learned that. reorder done case notice, I'm still praying massive lawsuit. 

Me too, massive lawsuits Australia AstraZeneca EU introducing export ban. seating Phase III..... four patience

Nobody cares anymore think sure culturally acceptable US. brother works Japanese Company US, already type culture. think makes sense. Given bad American food is, it’s amazing people risk getting sick itz  Climate scientist friendly reminder pandemic one way relatively soon, permanent changes coming anyway. 

If want changes dictated want seat table discuss best implementation changes, would best prioritize issue vote longer wait, authoritarian measure going be. want way, time.

I strongly encourage people learn experience proactive changes implemented, negatively impact anyone. prepared are, convenient unnoticeable changes be. 

It COULD smooth sailing. really, really could. want that. couldn’t help play “Shots” Lil Jon car went get vaccine morning, haha dad sister two them. get first one next Friday. Brazil way reporting cases deaths. PGA tour see almost 10k spectators. 5k last time! wear shirt work, what's difference cloth that's face.

You're deliberately obtuse. 5 Texas Ironic  Exactly, people think movement huge problem actually listened proponents promoting. I'm confused. get accepted US? 60% effectiveness even non-ideal dosage amount? thought anything 50 would get green light. rush anything. CDC pinned tweet today saying covid cases “on rise” every metric says otherwise. It’s ridiculous.  Cool, except numbers incorrect 1,470,623 doses/8.42 per 100 administered average 40-60k per day last week two. limited supply moment (AZ delays) rate distribution kind irrelevant right now.

Also, looking post history seems like UK (as ""union plague countries"" ""Netherlands useless can't 20,000 day"" make obvious lol). feel obligated tell I'm Dutch even European, live here. really, really care dumb nationalist argument. I'm trying explain original comment was, said, hyperbolic. someone lives Melbourne, lot pressure state government reduce measures federal government pulling rug social welfare support brought help people pandemic. 

I think state government risk vaccinations well way yeah. sit last place Georgia wishing Kemp would resign."
