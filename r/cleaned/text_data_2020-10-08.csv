0,2020-10-08," people currently work prob think gonna keep high salaries move cheaper places. Give years competition people working home wallet hard. needing less calories But, Russia vaccine! mean they've lying us?! Good thing parents staff 10 also tell get activated temperature changes I'll happy man. always get one first nights turn AC Spring, year exception. ohio.gov, 18 deaths per day last 21 days. That's 378 last 3 weeks.   Read Perd's voice Well maybe we'd get Robespierre back. rode train Germany Austria. ends find, Czech part jam packed nobody wore mask. absolute insanity. inevitable now. Numbers absolutely terrible. Notice however, can’t handle even idea people may think differently.

That 'thinking differently' refusing suffer *very* mild inconvenience wearing mask. would actually alleviate real burdens shouldered healthcare workers, elderly would certainly allow people service sector keep jobs. People really need reality check point refuse follow measures needed contain attacked “dissent” (unintelligently might add) insulted me.

As opposed oh-so-very intelligent reasons anti-masker, must something angry inside respond person like that.

The majority people playing parts following measures help countries stay open safely. Look current numbers countries like US France - they're high, they're **also much lower** otherwise would people following necessary measures. There's nothing selfish wanting benefit efforts everyone else refusing one's part. I'd sooner rude via calling people completely self-centered.

'Oh can't drink overly crowded bar'. Boo hoo, go ask overworked healthcare workers think problems anything trivial.  Yo dawg heard like Outsourcing Outsource Outsourcing Outsource Outsource. personally wouldn’t care eliminated rules solely good. don’t want wear seatbelt stupid you. want get selfie inches edge Grand Canyon you. Masks, smoking, clearly effect everyone. Things like addictive drugs pretty clearly things spill beyond individual choice shocks MANY people incredibly selfish self-centered cannot think terms 'protecting people saving relatives' instead 'I wanna wanna nobody going take away me!'.

It difficult accept this.

A species could actually survive would happy lock two three YEARS meant saving everyone preventing mass slaughter disability. decent species even think can't go bar club - would think 'this terrible, want whatever prevent spread nightmare!'

Humans really, truly suck. disease taught humans deeply awful creatures selfish cannot entirely believe DESERVE survive.

Fuck Mankind. Seriously. Look Taiwan. Life barely changed there. South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan. evidence clear early pandemic something better nothing economically. baffling top government officials failed see Lizards meth gators matter point felt calm past weeks, might enough people relax, despite increasingly rising numbers.

To think could've done restrictiony everybody would've done done. Czech Republic even top level medical authorities masks now. absolutely ridiculous. worst Europe, hospitals filling rapidly many people posting bigger bigger non senses social networks time.

PM saying weeks ago everything fine help either. Susan Collins said concerned?  I'll tell march /r/coronavirus ~60% us, perhaps. really hoping would catch like Asia, politicization prevent ever norm generation two. want army meth gators taking world? Smash motherfucking covid record win court it. Apparently wokeness protects virus. least that’s told BLM protests back May. Lolll, that's dumbest thing ever heard. Source: Russian functioning brain. Love pull crazy, ridiculous ""assumption"" based absolutely nothing ass take total fact. No, recording Covid deaths ""natural causes"" (you think country world someone old die write ""they old"" instead specific disease??No) So... could getting arses kicked court this? think look shape proteins don’t know. 

From however, new pictures SARS-CoV-2 become essential fight pandemic. Vaccine developers study virus’s structure ensure antibodies made vaccines grip tightly virus. Drug developers concocting molecules disrupt virus slipping nooks crannies proteins jamming machinery.

.[here’s scientific article  Holding back fallout like. It'll come eventually people see is, partisan lens all. effect revelation style different daily live updates condition one America's recognizable politicians, side side Trump's daily proclamations virus big deal everyone needs chill mafia taking over?  Thanks! This.  parent stay home children possible!!! Yeah man. Fuck that. im glad still people like least best dont follow assholes blindly. Cheers understand governments reticent lock - populous whole idea wants things return normal. six months FFS.

However, fact need lock fucked locking April-June, everyone still 'pulling together' (except americans) easier get people comply. got numbers zero then, would able normality now.

So use do. means closing bars, restaurants, etc. obey, fining people meet homes etc. get control - situation going get better eradicate disease - first defined regions, everywhere country.

And news antibodies lasting 3 months, coupled certainty mutations, even vaccines unlikely solution (and arrive mid next year earliest) - get rid disease population. Portland last show like March 16, Eugene slotted following night Great. put “essential workers” (essential low wage job; disposable low income person judging terribly society treats them) ahead obese grey hairs see packing Florida bars restaurants around me? 900,000 normal english.  one buying bullshit selling, quite literally. Masks already normal billions. People Asia already wearing masks sick. keep smog dust out. Either way wearing masks closer normalcy expected. Especially sick one. dimwits sending students hospitals ""cure"" corona virus faith healing. so-called ""Christians"" hard-core believers power prayer. Science penetrate. need to. God speaking plainly right now, ignoring word getting smited.

The Bethel School Supernatural Ministry smited God blasphemy, gullibility, disingenuousness. smited pestilence unclean. brought worshiping wrongly. religion false one, leads people astray, angered God getting smited hard.

It's time people renounce false religion. smiting continue do. need change evil ways, learn believe science cooperate pandemic precautions stop unclean. Staying flat going down, nothing worry about. deaths? Whatever happened vaccine rushed out? completely baseless, uneducated opinions, that's important distinction.

I'm sure Stephen Hawking thought opinions important, actually right that. Oh fuck! new normal then. dunno doctor give vaccine mandated early 90s, honest I'm also confused pretty serious moral dilemma deciding whether go not. right thing.

We went, really excellent show. felt incredibly stupid guilty quite while. Kate Brown made shutdown call right walking Moda IDGAF, that's exactly on. lame. trying hard USA. test banned substances. Learning former colonials across pond. error estimate you’re talking measure times flu actually contributed someone’s death way. doctor reason blame death due least part Influenza, write such. also true COVID-19. Comparing verified death counts much much valid flu estimate isn’t merely catch everyone died infected flu didn’t get tested it. uses every bit relevant data think adjust actual death count upwards. tries capture full extent disease’s burden, every last bit it. even considers deaths where, example, flu worsened someone’s pre-existing condition got flu later died pre-existing condition. fundamentally different measure raw death count.

Again, I’m using covid death count. don’t know keep talking I’ve repeatedly explained I’m referencing covid people died average week 2019, total death count year ~2.85M people. coronavirus. far year averaging ~62,000 deaths per week, pace hit ~3.24M deaths end year average holds true.

So, 390,000 deaths end year, assuming rate stays around means 62,000 / 5,300 = 11.69 roughly calculated limit maximum error factor COVID-19 estimate could have. plenty room estimated death count double, triple, verified death count, more.

This absolutely insane calculation. Sure, assume **literally everyone dies year, died covid**, get 11.69x official count. That’s terrible way figure real error bars could reasonably be. real upper limit number calculated earlier (390,000) reach end course hundreds thousands millions unaccounted deaths, disease rages undoubtedly leaving wake thousands tens even hundreds thousands unaccounted causes death.

No, happening. See above. likely tens thousands, chances hundreds thousands unaccounted deaths vanishingly small. enough **excess** deaths year test someone COVID-19 dying come negative mean COVID-19 contribute death. get idea did, much like flu, need take external data account, like die from, chances ever contracted COVID, chances exacerbated pre-existing condition created new preexisting condition ultimately led demise road, long COVID infection subsided. flu estimated calculated comparing COVID’s verified death count misleading faulty.

That’s I’m comparing two numbers. I’m comparing number additional deaths occurred year covid, estimated excess deaths, vs estimated number flu related deaths per CDC.

The rest comment treading ground. Hopefully understand I’m saying now.  2% antibodies Wisconsin.  assumption clear would like be. community spread reasonable threshold schools open in-person. risk level children almost literally zero.....Couple option opt-out remote kids autoimmune issues on. It’s incredibly sad online learning widening inequality.  Genuine question I’m sure I’ll get grilled would make sense also children part group also. May considered high risk perspective seeing critical conditions spreader point view schools not? Coronavirus likes this.  I’ve seen distinct decline US shit-talking last months realization slowly hits them. Funny never said don’t wear mask. fact I’ve never issue wearing mask. Notice however, can’t handle even idea people may think differently. 

You attacked “dissent” (unintelligently might add) insulted me. Get yourself. must something angry inside respond person like that. I’ll admit makes feel good know miserable losers would stuff.

I look forward response. I’m sure you’ll acknowledge rudeness./s asking people move Vancouver cloud app jobs tho Yeah small national count. dip White House villain? wish covid straight killed testicles. Killed them, shrivel up, die, fall necrotic horrible. Imagine much mask-wearing social distancing, much belief attention science would create! would ZERO super-spreader events. Covid would taken infinitely seriously current threat possible death. 

If covid necrotized penises - would disease traced contained, everywhere, within two weeks. would claiming political hoax covid made penises rot off. Even five percent happen.

I truly think this. Death? Eh, whatever. Penises rotting off? MUST TAKE SERIOUSLY. mean yeah hopefully next couple years. march away many commuting daily one silver linings pandemic. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article keep mind people inoculated, restrictions begin gradually, surely, lifted really want imaginary island burn. Look can't pretend afford made-up island mean belittle us can. mean bought island honestly going tell one friends invited island wait pandemic go? Oh wait everything catch fire. That’s do. Deflect. “We may racist, least we’re racist America countries!” “Sure, cheered Kevin Durant’s achilles injury, fanbase shoes would same!” Esp. get new job next 12 months so. state fired health directr really normalized wearing masks big cities years ago, would less severe flu seasons also nearly many selfish dickheads acting like bratty children wear piece cloth face short sometimes. keeping distance strangers hurt either, pandemic not. 

The lack basic respect care fellow citizens people shown year disgusting frankly deeply disappointing, thought would better this. think would great, *this* bad. state fired health directr Sure, different shows higher ticket prices theaters need revenue.

Fucking piece shit sensationalist headlines! !kminder 2 weeks you’re suggesting people wear masks every flu season you’re absolutely insane. Honestly, long ago I'd worry misremembering also immune mumps then. Like say - mumps orchitis absolutely classic thing. Measles main feature. lots viruses cause orchitis theory, mumps like one four chance something.

However striking thing saying vaccinated measles. Everyone be. insanely contagious might end immunity nothing catch measles. Asking compare parks countries accurate one may think. disease works exponential curve, cases cases get generally unless compensatory strategies put place. theme park Hong Kong low starting rates opening theme parks much, much different theme park US much higher daily baseline active cases opening up. address anything said. think 10%?  Doin ur mom That’s works. Keep wishing harm people bruised ego, that’ll get places.   Nothing new sun.
Women traditionally suck dieing. weird!!! What's weird it? expand short response?  Oh shut fuck up, guy replied objectively wrong stop irrational fucking conspiracy nut start base outlook facts instead general mistrust authorities.

Being sceptical good, assuming everything shit based nothing better assuming everything great based nothing, probably even worse. What? tried concert Idaho March? kidding me? U.S. also tests significantly 

France testing per capita early September. don’t think changed much right now. I’d never go private island like that, 200 years water. Herman Cain's ghost attend via twitter. virus spread quickly, debilitate, kill population, forces shut population centres exact scenario prepare for.

Add COVID long haulers case relevant public health. Risk extremely small. fine. Wearing mask near people higher risk wearing mask outside near one. Must Trump rally. hear he's popular Moscow.   totally take risk I’d reconsider loved ones life high risk.

So much this. I’d agree goal Ontario 1k cases day. healthcare system overwhelmed that’s putting restrictions place? **Soviet nation's** health minister, Mikhail Murashko 
 
wtf shit Could easily make restaurant. Especially tourist area. Keep eye Indiana. Currently totally open except bars restaurants, everyone must seated (so guess would mean dancing nightclubs), businesses supposed maintain ability social distance (though really strict guidance it’s enforced far tell). Schools open using hybrid approach. 

There essentially restrictions capacity anywhere. still mask mandate. 

All Covid indicators trending (positive cases, ER visits, hospitalizations, ICU admissions) except deaths. 

So would say that’s considered moderate approach comments I’ve read here. keep getting sicker, it’s going affect employers reduced staff, customers stay home don’t think it’s worth get sick eat restaurant. Big companies don’t want liability tracking sick workers going keep WFH possible. 

The reality easy answers it’s gonna suck long time. fixing economy herd immunity one way other. sympathize people can’t pay bills. less patience people complaining haircuts bars. find tested population represents population whole? close vaccine approved distributed general public?

In general....I'm guessing around time next year. winter going suck. Watching ascents Le Tour, really bizarre see unmasked people shouting inches away riders mountains. people really don’t get it! really need information small town's coronavirus travails? We've got stuff going on, clutter. Ok, looked back comment reacted saying something saying. 

So - apologize. Compliance higher 80% commute, town office. Id interested seeing source lower. BURN THEM! Thats new, fact look old newspapers around long time.

Theres lot reasons social media sucks, one Keep mind though Flu Season death numbers estimates based upon sampling opposed COVID-19 numbers based upon actual count actual cases deaths. makes even absurd people waving flu death numbers faces sort evidence methods used estimate number influenza-associated deaths U.S.?
The **methods estimate annual number influenza-associated deaths** described detail elsewhere (1-2). **The model** uses ratio deaths-to-hospitalizations **in order estimate total influenza-associated deaths** **estimated** number influenza-associated first look many in-hospital deaths observed FluSurv-NET. **in-hospital deaths adjusted under-detection influenza** using methods similar described hospitalizations using data frequency sensitivity influenza testing. Second, deaths related influenza occur hospital, use death certificate data **estimate** likely deaths occur outside hospital. look death certificates pneumonia influenza causes (P&amp;I), respiratory circulatory causes (R&amp;C), non-respiratory, non-circulatory causes death, deaths related influenza may influenza listed cause death. use information causes death FluSurv-NET determine mixture P&amp;I, R&amp;C, coded deaths include investigation death certificate data. **Finally, estimate proportion influenza-associated deaths occurred outside hospital, estimate deaths-to-hospitalization needed estimate influenza-associated deaths may lag two years season ends. yet available season estimated, adjust based values observed prior seasons (e.g., 2010-2011 season 2016-2017 season) update estimates current data become daily cases three places.

So site this? easy right? 675,000 Americans Spanish flu  Georgia’s largest county school districts haven’t back face face, though starting back soon believe. lot ones started back rural counties. county (one largest ones) went back face face week. largest county start back next week.

Also, state hasn’t reporting rapid test results official “positive” count, lot places rapid tests now, official numbers absolutely accurate. Summer seem slow things northern hemisphere... name Eva Girl (lf talk boot licking) many german women tried make many lil nazi Boys possible getting Award called ""mutterkreuz"" man wanted died horrible ways something wrong mainly good intention. Many people thought necessary fight survive. Also women thought right. 

Edit: also Google Ilse Koch witch Buchenwald - sexism. uncool. may never vaccine least year away available are? There’s even two Americas.

Edit lol are. That's easy hell Tool lyrics Depends, need balance. Mental health kills. Stress kills.

Also Spain everything related COVID used propaganda government. shitshow.

Makes sense close city, allowing people inside whatever want, mainly people getting sick family friends gathering. Never said older politicians worthless. statement wasn’t diss older politicians, though directed towards them. Sure would nice get refund ticket though 🙄 reopening little good people scared go high covid numbers. that's goal needs beat virus first trying reopen. jumped gun never enforced measures know reduce infections. we'll terrible position longer many nations. lowered enough good contact tracing quarentining (and social support people) reopenings would happened without huge spikes infections. one Palpatine's Royal Guards? * Good luck finding doctor nurse willing live island you. I'm sure they'd cost arm leg.

Might well live small far fire goes fire place I've ever lived I'm concerned that.

TIL: People who've never fire immune fires. getting like last man earth every month.   Well, would gain everyone here, thats sure. whole nation pissed brink uprising, really decides lock us down, might interesting. 

Considering fact citizens outgun government forces several times over. Thank 😂 SHUT FRONT DOOR! I've wrong years. question.

Today went bank, hot dont know why, took stupid choice getting car without mask put mask outside.

I did, parking lot virtually empty put mask seconds getting out.

Should worried got infected could get someone infected asymptomatic? wondered well. performed recovering?  
...I think mental timeline right. Wow went Phase 3 fast. must seeing nice results early trials.

Anyone know long Regeneron cocktail lasts for?

Having one, Regeneron Eli Lilly’s available starting end year save many lives. Fancy living country government doest give flying F#ck whether live died. Incredible. people go work Trolls gonna troll, guess? Bye! 

(To anyone else reading this, takes minute Google stats Ontario, guy full shit. I'm genuinely surprised see 3 hour old account. Time block another troll.) flu Covid something like 50% increased risk death? I’d look statistic saw needless say two respiratory illnesses best experienced simultaneously idea reporting morons throwing indoor bashes, whether cultural reasons party get smashed good time, somehow betrayal trust underhanded activity, makes literally sense.

Like ""snitching"" someone who's slightly tipsy behind wheel.

So I'm wondering people use term, 'cause thing, genuinely feel reporting dangerous behavior is...wrong?

EDIT, response previous comment (unsure deleted, feel political) - give flying fuck behind closed doors unfortunately directly impacts everyone else around you, get sick go anyplace outside.

Me? able see family overseas entire year whole country quarantined rest planet, never got control. Hence good reason give shit throwing massive party middle pandemic.

In case, understand mindset mind: masks, vaccines sort thing? help get coming from. one point France 80% compliance. more. I’m curious get now. Let's see goes next several months. work faang quite lot people clear difficulties working home, there's also anything day (especially manager side). want continue work home we'll change whole level evaluation probably considerably restructure company. Without able build relationship face face manager peers good luck advancing career getting promoted. dog farting? re-opening schools, literally change past month thinking Europe contained. 

Shit flairs practically overnight Yeah seems like valid timeline. said without vaccine possible. much money involved staging production. Investors going risk shutdown losing everything. political bias here. asking figure want agree something?

Dialysis patients ***not*** representative population whole. They're much likely limit social interactions wear masks, since know significant preexisting conditions. study almost certainly reflected lower seproprevalance nation large.

But even didn't- even accurate- still three months ago, I'm pretty sure people gotten virus since July. Like...quite more. Yikes that’s lot 14 flatten curve!!!""

Lol what? Yet. You’re suggesting shut entire world economy? don’t mean rude might want google purpose United Nations..  hope take long recover Tool release new albums. understand can't understand scientific consensus common sense.

WTF? respond wrong person? I'm writing study recruitment acting like kind covid denier. Here’s works US, least: multiple strands influenza. Australia gets flu season US, strands prominent Australia’s flu season ones included vaccine US. flu vaccine well matched, reduce risk 40 60%.

Generally, hear particular flu vaccine “doesn’t work”, means strands showing flu season don’t quite match vaccine. Because, Australia helpful predicting flu season, it’s exact. doesn’t mean shouldn’t get it. Every year different. even contract influenza, vaccine typically lessen symptoms. That's right. Let's focus China lying, bad Russia, Brazil, India breaking records. Keeping chanting CCP virus. help us preventing Americans dying. Yes. #1. Broken arms ayooo Almost like system broken tax reforms needed.   whatever Floridon't. Honestly believe anymore? Yeah essentially body mounting immune response vaccine. people say ""got sick"" vaccine, really felt way body ramping mechanisms ward potential infection. happening.

so next time kicking back shitty beer boys whining intellectual liberal elite talk dont respect you, remember times like decided play childish games instead earning respect. You’re right, still minuscule numbers higher average: 0-19 years: 0.00003

*Definitely* sounds scarier list “2.9x” (keep up, that’s you’re going for) that’s 2.9x tiny tiny number lol Okay things worse flu = lockdown, better flu = change? Putin trump race lmao. written statement assembly, health minister said current estimate R, rate infection, 1.3 number people one infected person pass virus to, Swann said last week, **there 100% increase cases reported 15% increase testing.** Agree. Netherlands big increase positives moment. 

For reasons. asking. treatment much better? can't tell sarcastic. stopped following updates back. Obviously, listen health mandates, follow updates anymore. much. tried *not* subject immutable laws universe? body says time die, brain ways shutting whole thing down. Honestly, people must willfully ignorant understand point reported deaths resulted positive covid test. Excess deaths another (important) metric might include deaths directly caused covid, calculated later time, really make much sense add 30% like even watch video? happening clinics measured responses people diagnosed covid. seeing patient patient symptoms (they list like 3, laundry list) period 6-10 months, yes, okay making statements like this. coming forward 10s thousands could affected, handful. might like Umbrella Academy want something witty drama/science fiction.

There’s thing: chickens much smarter give credit for. According research, demonstrated unexpected cognitive abilities (please see [Brainy Bird] published Scientific American, 2017 [study] glimpse count, show level self-awareness, even manipulate one another.

They also good episodic memory demonstrate empathy towards chickens [and chicks] subjected unpleasant stimuli, among well developed cognitive emotional functions.
This [study] (“Chickens Lot Smarter Originally Thought”: Changes Student Attitudes Chickens Following Chicken Training Class”) shows animal science veterinary students’ perceptions chicken intelligence capacity experience emotion thus overall attitude chicken changed participating chicken training class.

Fish also far dumb species found outperform animals generally regarded intelligent higher primates cognitive tasks. 
[This] good article it, since it’s paywalled I’m posting entire thing next comment. don’t mean overwhelm links, especially information widely avaliable - suggest google “fish intelligence” (there’s even Wikipedia article exact title nice scientific references) “chicken intelligence” you’re interested. Also take look [this] regarding fish sentience.


One thing don’t understand though, base moral code intelligence, sentience really relevant comes question ethics. Human babies lot less intelligent many animals eat, humans intellectual disabilities same. opinion people lower intellectual capacity less worthy empathy consideration intelligent individuals? animals may considered less intelligent others assessment, they’re still highly capable experiencing pain suffering. don’t think refrain inflicting them?

There’s one thing sister said discovered veganism (it got it) stuck me. told you, lupus seriously depressed long time (she’s lot better now). told knew pain suffering well learned suffering animals, way going continue inflict them. said bad enough suffered didn’t want cause suffering beings. thought admirable her.

I think even don’t feel empathetic toward animals, still understand harmful consuming (to them, planet). Empathy one route leads take issue animal suffering decide take part it. It’s definitely requirement veganism, definitely get reason alone. Personally, wouldn’t call animal lover all, understand it’s wrong subjugate make sentient beings suffer sake. lives mine take bodies mine exploit. also understand great harms industries based animal exploitation overall. 

I really don’t think there’s anything wrong trying show people strive veganism. Cause really get it, stops outside demand realize it’s right do. think far many people turn vegetarian reducterian satisfied that, especially vegans others oppose kind animal suffering keep reinforcing idea telling that’s good enough. I’m trying show people more. I’m trying show omnivore, i’ve replying people already supposedly half-way through, particular reasons settled there. scenario.

Haven’t seen before? c0nservatives fucking dumb? actually believe one without hot take part would say March/April. notice one light’s on. Trump tweeting night instead sleeping? friend lives Morrison preschooler. Small world. checked post history you.

I live Denver take dogs cats getting sick dying people take seriously... Immunity lasting 12 months would certainly unideal would impossible surmount. Vaccinating large proportion population year would doable think, considering stakes. 

I know fraction population gets annual flu shot, think pretty clear flu amount pressure incentive get done regularly would enormous. Sorry. 74 growing backwards using entirely natural paleo means. course last forever. They'd planning accept results election matter. Peru never real lock down. tried markets would still get packed Except are.  Today’s number push 7 day average tomorrow. Preaching choir man :( Inbreeding pretty striking first glance. April 30, global death toll due coronavirus 230,000. That’s 1.5 times number deaths world expects average day. number would seem large fact highly unevenly distributed. five high-income countries (HICs)—the United States, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain, France—account 70 percent global deaths.

Data quality seems main driver quality—accuracy, completeness, consistence, timeliness, validity—is likely main culprit true death toll reflected statistics. testing limited untimely, data quality suffer—as experience high-income countries may better measured infection, especially HICs, even ample evidence COVID-19 deaths misattributed different causes. estimates, reported death rates selected countries could underestimated 60 percent.

It account though. Arms Wide Open

 Cue shitty 90s song probably would gone better removed name “Trump” post title. seems like apolitical figure. without piece evidence everyone's bashing Trump continue.. got nothing, go ad hominem... Yes. following simple guidelines, time force. right now...just like 2024 lol don’t really mean imply he’s Manchurian candidate Russian double agent you? realize Trump 100% sociopathic, professional bullshit artist. It’s always true, getting message across exhausting. Wow! fucking flawless. thats coming mouth! agree trump admin totally failed regard can't done forever. Yes agree, healthy debate NHC's daily report numbers. present supporting evidence like China testing program test individuals working risk professions every two weeks allowed detect quickly situations like two asymptomatic carriers Qingdao, evidences like lack cases Chinese travellers going countries. people refute able intelligent discussion.

That's asked question [""are aware sort pandemic prevention measures China put instead people asking ""I sure news source allowed"", goes train thought allow intelligent discussion. can’t dead - he’s still tweeting! got back Walmart Surprise, AZ.

They're touchy, allow space even slightest subtle nuance.  think realized forget wear depends undergarment, inadvertantly released 1 -2 combo  lasted Late May opened everything back thought winning virus agw = Global warming typo? 

Thanks kind words. I’m expert epidemiology decent math/statistics credentials. Maybe I’m wrong minor points I’m happy educated I’m wrong, point view it’s pretty crazy actually attempt *honestly* compare COVID-19 Influenza. live NY. got hit hard early, silver lining; people take seriously. Mask usage almost universal since April. 

As result, life mostly back normal. still go dinner, even went away weekend summer (to CT state, also one safest), took trip city, usual fall apple/pumpkin picking everything fine. Brand new local businesses even starting open. Case numbers (Predictably) risen slightly since fall, test positivity remains around 1%.

Im fortunate work home, could honestly live like long needed. Life since got control fine, even better ways. fucking way closing gyms bars serve food keeping else open brought cases like that. Compare curve Sweden's, similar. achieved level herd immunity AZ. Concerts traveling concerts main release. literally see red rocks every morning driving kid preschool. bitter Death growing 50 % compared day prior dosen't mean cumulative death rising way. 

If pure exponential - aka rising tiny value 50% per day - does. start pandemic case disease first entered area, obviously fail see Sweden could stopped deaths general mid march. 

Sweden's spread much slower, way would stopped deaths simply protecting nursing homes. larger percentage deaths nursing homes anywhere else. 

The implication system personal responsibility, older people outside nursing homes catch much younger people did, since acted early warn people. nursing homes still spread fast everywhere else. began testing quickly put end nursing home outbreaks, deaths quickly plummeted. Nursing homes tiny percentage infections, mortality overwhelmingly high.

I admit cannot back sources. Tegnell ""admitted"" mistakes times; could see said them. Well also one going 116 degree weather. Also lot us travelling 😬 deaths make feel 20 years younger? Asking dead relative. Young people. U.S. IFR, everyone NYC would infected twice we'd 160 million infections country-wide already. prediction Bible regarding anti-christ says antichrist delt deadly blow... Satan intervenes saves him. There's nothing wrong extra layer protection, hospitals people nice talking point bot Dallas went 1200 cases day 600 two weeks mask mandate put place Texas. dropping lax enforcement ETRs keeping around 200 day I'm curious man wore mask not. I'm assuming didn't. didn't, voluntary? voluntary, mandated by, err...the president, sort violation work safety? see, problem there's way really *measure* much enforcement done, whether people truly following precautions, besides speculation. feel like actual quantitative analysis would nice sort relationship enforcement measures covid conditions given region. 

Furthermore think looking case counts misleading. account number tests ran daily reports numbers cases include cases tests happened week ago sooner. useful put context hospitalization trends, look cases specimen collection date, note trends % positivity. Using raw numbers alone prone kinds inaccuracies. guess that's different topic though. 

And there's still nothing home transmission vector. People get flu shot, get flu anyway, still come home infect multiple people house flu. Kind goes. So, spread regardless. 

Anyway... also feel hyper focus masks take away NPI's matter physical distancing, hand washing, staying home sick. talk masks, masks, masks, kind miss stuff too. probably agree though, messaging throughout awful surprised maskless asshole called anecdotal told quiet.

Sorry loss. March. trying save lives everything novel virus

They buckled political pressure approve emergency authorization need to. scientists doctors could continued study without emergency authorization. evidence rest world became overwhelming, revoke approval.

our healthcare system shit overworked underpaid. we've groomed consumerists. we're debt. mean?

it means lot people emotionally stunted dealt trauma. since birth they've shoving feelings consumerism - food, clothes, shoes, gadgets, phones, movies, tv shows, video games, sex, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes... compulsions. things people reach automatically, without thinking.

They trying prevent panic-buying masks. Plain simple. unfortunate Fauci said said fuels many anti-mask people.

And you/no one answered question new revelations mask science caused shift mask advice? Wait...there actually new ""mask science"" since original advice lie Fauci mitigate PPE shortages, right?

What role Trump play decisions made individual states mitigate virus? deaths care homes NY fault well? Cuomo bear responsibility decision fill care homes infected persons?

It's fascinating emotion warp person's perception events.

Lot questions there. Lets see *them* get answered. feeling “high risk” group gets vaccinated first going everybody Cus white America took land movies, way top brass leaders ever together get infected decimated enemy scheming get position; protagonists smart moral otherwise dumb.

In real life, enemies watch America's top brass leaders get room plague, no-one wears mask takes precautions. Enemies look confused say other, ""Lenin's Ghost, doing??!"" Everyone commenting masks driving factor begins the75% drop. 

What about: ""restrictions public events closures bars, gyms, movie theaters restaurants"" know you’re sarcastic. I’m still triggered comment lol  Take chill pill relax I... oof... feel like sin nature I’m doctor could read whole book.

The ethical issue complex one (Tuskegee Holocaust experimentation bad. Obviously), really wanted explore that, since author wasn’t medicine, things normal (driving around collect animal blood would possibly early cultures), equated things aren’t (colored wards) moral gray areas (if tissue saves lives, ethical keep it, ethical give family choice). third in, gave up.  Prescott pretty far right compared Arizona's population, wife recently made comment. Trump like dies dies could stopped January, chose even try. comment ""If surprised 85-90%."" That's raised eyebrow me. I'm tired people asserting things can't possibly know virus vaccine. Like know *because know virus* would mean vaccine virus 80-90% make sense called out. 

We need humble thing. new. terrified potential long term effects Coronavirus people though, like can't kids drop dead 10 years now?

I think worry helpful think utility might provide. smoker worrying effects smoking maybe could useful giving extra motivation quit. still worry time, least *could* beneficial. 

But use another example, took lot MDMA (and psychoactives) back day fairly stupid unhealthy way. possible hit 50 60 damage done mean get dementia neurological disease. can't undo taking drugs useful worry it. don't.

If already try generally healthy lifestyle (which presumably would try anyway). value worrying it. 

You might say can't control kind thought probably control thoughts lead thought actions/behaviours triggers thought chain. watching news TV leading terrified (indirectly) stop watching news TV while. get news sources. particularly negative person know, tell STFU. 

On specific concerns though reason think either things happen. mean, might well dwell idea Coronavirus make penis larger, make handsome raise IQ 30 points - ridiculous thoughts well might well happy ridiculous. Unfortunately it’s going binary process vaccine approved - vaccine rollout take time (with vaccine candidates requiring booster one month later). importantly, it’s guaranteed vaccine 100% efficacy - FDA approve anything 30% efficacy greater, would take significant bite percentage needed true herd immunity. But, actual efficacy, 70% people received vaccine would still vulnerable, would since don’t necessarily know 70% are, masks still necessary. It’s unfortunate, fact matter it’s likely going take multiple vaccine candidates iterations get true immunity. real debate need focus relative scaling back restrictions appropriate larger proportion populace gains immunity. Trump caused death 200k Americans misinformation. kill 200k JUSTICE served.

Republican leadership must stop encouraging wreckless behavior start encouraging use sanitary precautions. accomplice Trump.  Yeah idk vaccine work long time. sure. Reinfections happen like 5% something cases. That's new Zealand cases 100 days started new cases cause reinfections. Idk vaccines work might 3 months thing every time take make better one. sure. figure goes. Wow, really sucks. 

Sorry turned bit rant maybe way interesting. skip 'I'm immune myself' potentially useful part. 

If one critique environmental movement whole, it'd much messaging demands serious lifestyle changes people interest change, basically shames changing. *so easy* seriously cut one's carbon footprint simple choices *that way affect quality life*- mean things like using LED bulbs, throw solar panels, buy efficient furnace, get smart thermostat backs HVAC work, etc. wish environmentalists would focus message- improve footprint simply easily *without reduced quality life*. That's message almost anyone get behind, especially since usually saves money. 

Unfortunately much messaging 'stop this, start that'. Stop eating meat, start smelly compost pile, stop enjoying hot showers, start taking fast cold showers, stop driving nice car, start driving crappy Prius acceleration, etc. 

The result backlash actions like 'rolling coal'- heard it, people big engine diesel trucks take emissions control hardware exhaust system, crank fuel injection way up, floor truck produces huge cloud thick black smoke. form [anti-environmental (wish making up, I'm not). 

I think husband's actions sort like rolling coal. unfortunate. 

**I'm immune myself.** 
I fully support environmental efforts, think climate change going seriously harm humanity (and stupid fault). also strongly rebel anyone telling live life. buy efficient HVAC afford, smart thermostat shut nobody's home, still want crank thing sleep cold bedroom middle summer, strongly resist effort telling to. 
Could reduce environmental footprint lifestyle changes? Sure. could meet people job last resort, could take quick cold showers, could leave HVAC uncomfortable house, yes, could stop eating meat. 
I'm going things, want enjoy life things give better life. Meeting people face face makes better job, makes money, rest things make life fun. 

I like plenty non meat foods. sometimes try choose meat environmental reasons. want ethically raised meats try buy organic much possible. 
My partner (who also cares planet eats meat) sometimes suggests things like veggie burgers. I've few, taste like sawdust paint thinner both. Closest I've Burger King one, tasted like overdone normal burger (IE smoke meat). get suggestion, natural instinct poke fun it- 'Have fun rabbit food, I'm going real food' type thing. always (after jabs) admit veggie option better planet. 

But sometimes wonder make jab first place. natural instinct. Maybe 'resource guarding' thing- old brain emotion thinks tribe's food source stolen. Maybe unjustified emotional reaction PETA 'meat murder' hypocrites, smug virtue-signalling types personify joke 'how know someone vegetarian? need to, they'll tell you'. 
Or maybe internal struggle; know eating meat (even best cases) bad carbon standpoint, actively seeking meat alternatives giving every possible chance rather continually referencing nasty fake burgers tried years ago... maybe know one subbing salads steaks, making fun 'rabbit food diet'. 
Or maybe ethical hypocrisy fully admit. opportunities go hunting, desire personally kill innocent animal refuse. think that's one things first time hard, something inside changes, easy; want easy, want become sort person. yet actions causing happen- buy steak, (and like me) buy steak, farmer breeds raises slaughters cow, dirty work meal hypocritically refuse enjoy undeserved result without getting hands dirty. clear, think killing (humanely treated) animals food necessarily wrong, think hypocritical eat meat willing pull trigger. 

THAT SAID, none excuses getting emotional insulting. may explain it, excuse it. Relationships need communication, compromise, mutual respect- respect dietary choices, respect his. give rabbit food (sorry!) fair try eat time time totally unpalatable; okay eating meat like veggie dish. go back forth- meat nights non meat nights pizza something. 
But matter underlying emotional issues are, excuse getting pissed insulting dietary choices. may hate vegetarianism fiery passion, may rile wants, love hates vegetarianism. 

I doubt much help you, hopefully maybe little... study percentage cases long term effects? Also many European countries small dense. US massive restrictions/testing varies wildly. TBQH wouldnt want someone inject ""experimental"" drugs body guy paid it. 80 miles 128.75 km Anti mask pro life, makes sense can't admit big man wrong . really want argue 

We're mostly discussing subjective matters. nigh impossible wrong comes subjective matters, even polar opposite sides, there's nothing argue about. We're respectful, rational, adult discussion slight differences perspective. also compost...

Why? Theres lots sources ecologically responsible made compost. usually much higher quality much safer people make home. 

Most people get homemade compost tested. even fewer test goes added. to, lot discarded due heavy metal concentrations. fruit trace arsenic problem eat, even beneficial. trace amount arsenic 500 fruits concentrated composting become wildly toxic uptaken many plants deposited fruit bodies.

Of course, despite knowing that, still make compost encourage means well. could easily justified something people banned ""for good"" carries numerous risks environment consumer's health done really interested solution current level meat production devastating impacts climate, soil groundwater.

It's likely solution problems current level plant based agriculture *it's* devastating impacts climate, soil, air quality groundwater. 

I expect solutions problems they've far escaped society throughout human history, claim know fix problems either. 

Well, besides killing humans, would effectively solve lot planet's problems, would issue us can't think anything else prohibition big industrialized meat production Germany live.

In US tried 13 years alcohol, went very, badly. followed 90 years (and counting) prohibition cannabis plant derived intoxicants led millions shattered lives snd endless atrocities injustices via war drugs.

And intoxicants far less ubiquitous revered meat. 

You might well try banning sex religion. could done, probably would make peaceful, benevolent society. 

Quite simply, Prohibition simply work.

You either move production less regulated location create robust, unregulated black market associated societal problems come it.

Really, viable solution outside killing humanity imposing left-leaning flavor facism keep we're hope comes together make positive difference.

Keep researching educating people healthy eating habits, provide better access financial resources needed make ecoresponsible choices viable people, keep improving effeciency agricultural innovations continue making farming less harmful, improve plant based food effeciency, shelf life, logistics make accessible affordable, invest improving conditions less developed areas well regulated industry socioeconomically feasible, keep working create affordable human satisfying alternative meat meat-like products, keep working renewable powered farm machinery, keep developing better reclamation remediation methods etc, etc. finally agree tre45on weasel mass murderer? industry definitely would earlier cases lower testing accessible.

Testing harder, cloth masks could've since like March... depressing think much ruined inept response. happy anyone know effects taking dexamethasone (a immune suppressor) taking regeneron (a immune booster)? cancel out? what? loosely style lockdown works won’t see case number like everyday, good luck tell everybody stay inside regardless risk, socioeconomic situation.

The truth kind lockdown doesn’t work, instead let ruin everyone’s lives, ask vulnerable quarantine everyone else move usual. know. disgusting often see ""socialism bad"" country. 1 hour delay fetching comments.

Their 'lockdown' consisted restricting group sizes 100 1 month NZ. Auckland stricter restriction 10 people 2 weeks. might want educate NZ's actual measures commenting sure trying prove Finland far lower case/deaths per capita Sweden. They've also largely reopened since May without much issue. looked daily cases per capita compared want call normal? OK, guess define (at least protesting police state anymore, amirite?)

Their spike July like ~100-150 cases daily 2 weeks country 7.5mil. That's like US ~5.5k cases day, far threshold CDC (or even Fauci) said needed reopen safely. What's point?

Also, they've 20 cases daily since then. That's whole point flattening curve keeping way via mask mandates/social distancing guidelines - makes tracing new clusters thereby containment much believe anything China reports, OK. believe cases truly zero, bridge sell you. can't prove otherwise, because, know...communist state media.

I friends China say movement restrictions largely gone. really think China would outbreak kidding? shut Auckland month grand total 29 cases.

Auckland literally level 3 2 weeks (and level 2 things reopened) rest NZ level 2 tiny island nation closed borders

Your land borders visa office closed since start outbreak. virtually impossible non-residents travel US. What's point?

Also, coordinated plan *federal* level ensure whole country open safely time, that's terrible federal leaders, Trump ""Level 3"" lockdown severe New York spring. Everything closed, travel restricted, people stayed home time.

No idea would link something proceed lie. link literally travel within local area, example going work school, shopping, getting exercise. Public transport continue operate strict health safety requirements.

Were schools workplaces open NY? businesses require close physical contact allowed stay open? severe though!

Oh yeah, also 2 weeks 5 months since May. yeah, poor NZ, clearly way? New Zealand require chin diapers anywhere public transit. Guess know Science (tm)).

NZ requires masks community transmission. restrictions, masks social distancing, zero community cases. I'll let connect sure looks like hell there. They're obivously completely miserable. I'm glad daddy Cuomo kept us safe hellish existence!

If people selfish could abide social distancing guidelines NY. Sweden, aforementioned countries, looser restrictions citizens abide rules, keeps countries reopened safely.

It's practically common sense - making *small* sacrifices wearing masks follow social distancing whenever possible much greater good. Yet people like still fighting people like me, pesky sources facts, spreading scary propaganda. We're worst, right?

What facts? Everything posted debunked. Even NY's lowest, daily cases per capita far exceeds countries largely reopened lockdowns. reason rather obvious bad whole state held back idiots want things kept open refusing abide necessary measures. Rip :/ ain't fortunate one. No. using surveillance data flu, confirmed flu deaths. state, 109 flu deaths year 2,100 covid deaths. don’t surveillance data covid. closest measure would excess deaths. won't. shown willingness to, means to, built fleet invasion.

""Invasion"" Taiwan wants Americans believe America keep sending ships there. America,  part, uses ""threat invasion"" pretense region. Remember carrier is: floating US military base.

China wants invade Taiwan badly Taiwan wants declare independence; say, neither sides want happen.

Despite rhetoric, look Taiwan's official name. Taiwan, ROC. ROC = Republic China. America's threat enter invasion defend Taiwan stopping China. China enough firepower inland repel US fleet based attack.

What invasion fleet. 

The country massive invasion fleet USA. sure killing electoral base sounds winning strategy. 2022 next gubernatorial election Ducey can’t run he’ll already served 2 terms, god knows Republicans select instead Yes. specific symptom illness. ""Your freedom end someone else freedom begin.""  doubt vaccine take long, think people underestimate power capitalism push vaccine market. Billion dollar business fast get share. backed politics people, so... rich countries, maybe take longer, US, Europe, etc. vaccinated summer predict. kidding right? Oh look parrot zero original thought, unique! can't find video now, remember two Americans either Japan Korea, offered masks volunteer, refused said Cronoavirus hoax.

It's people like that's making embarrassed fellow countrymen. agree this. First, let say I'm defending actions, think absurd right now, people behave like played large role turning COVID-19 horrible pandemic. number infected officials 18 last saw, occurred less 2 weeks. likely cluster originates single official, shows quickly spreads proper precautions taken. fact president walking around testing positive, many americans die almost completely isolated quarantine, shocking, many comments describing easy slap face hundreds thousands families lost loved ones COVID-19. simply explaining why, legally laws written, possible charge him. 

The reason spreading COVID-19 different unintentionally spreading it. common way AIDS spread time ""intentional"" acts, sex, blood-to-blood, etc. Even then, law primarily enforced people either intentionally trying spread it, people negligent. also easy tell generally someone gave AIDS, requirements transfer placed certain date. infected person donated blood, injured themselves, sex specific date. 

COVID-19 different though. airborne disease, meaning act breathing means spread it. extremely varied incubation time, actual symptoms showing days weeks exposure, means difficult determine exactly exposure occured. Maybe infected person infected showing symptoms knew it? disease also widespread highly possible 2 weeks prior test, bumped someone else COVID-19. 

What charge people terrorism assault charges intentionally trying spread it, lady went store intentionally coughing groceries saying ""I COVID"". However, seem actively trying spread it, threaten spreading it, instead next nothing quarantine himself. Also, attempts charge would also unsuccessful, sitting president far reaching immunity lawsuits, Trump's lawyers trying apply definition broadly lawsuits judge presiding case told according interpretation, president decided stand middle times square shoot someone, legal system would totally powerless anything. Regulation bad. Also, sue McDonalds made coffee hot.

Obstructing freedom bad. Also, gays allowed sex.

Freedom religion good. Also, muslims allowed practise religion. state started indoor seating restaurants. hunch really bad idea though. Good god CDC six months behind yeah true. high numbers reason latest protests covid rules. dumb made even worse. stupid🤦🏻‍♂️ initial viral loads

infectious dose got call last week local school district. Despite increase statewide cases bringing kids back building want send son. 

Nope. He’s staying home virtual learning don’t know when. I’m sure shit putting health well hands backward ass people spawn live county.

Found rotten sandwich behind seat. idea. get tested? world revolve around American politics Dont think hottest day history. Think one coolest days next 100 years. careful COVID scale, 1 being: 

no precautions all, 

and 100 is: full lockdown total eradication,

Then US 5, we're asking *maybe* 10 15. hard understand. heard dogs dying it, let alone hundreds. I'm genuinely curious would love source true (because need one thing worry apparently 😬🐶) Pandemic starting election year worse scenario guys Google ""Countries well covid"" see hundreds real life examples reasoning sound skyscraper foundation made cheetos.

Everyone wants see family's. though likely kill them. read comments thread examples peoples family's murdered complacency. Herman cain died 1 month test much I'd love visit Japan again, fully support countries restricting travel places control. Gee wonder stopped? yep we're fucked...
politics bad job end. don’t even know you’re talking about. Cost freedom? It’s one simple mask. 

Wear god damn mask. wouldn’t call debt, suppose term could used. May (the main/ big restaurant) called asked could renegotiate lease offered pay half rent 2020, starting 2021, start making unpaid rent. yeah. wouldn’t discounted rent... cuz would’ve paid xx months. Say rent normally $10. It’s $5 rest 2020. 2021 it’s $11. 
 
It idea, drafted, sat June, decided shut instead. line reasoning gotten bad everyone first place. Calling idiot would insult idiots everywhere. Maybe spend less time making tiktok dance videos get work. respect hacks teting politicize pandemic. Disgusting. God CDC bit behind curve, ya think???? We've known months. Originally seem claiming deaths children, way worded shows users also picked this. 

With edit, I'll let comment stand, along discussion it, highlights importance getting facts right sub. Please careful word comments future. 

I appreciate stressful situation medical staff right now, excuse increasing stress others - particularly parents.  due respect, deleting comments like got us here. 

And may think incivil way saying something unfortunately situation fact mother law's friend type comment. adding 20,000+ new cases florida every week couple months now. Hey Netherlands, reading this?! Thanks. open Dipshit DeSantis gave green light go full capacity. It’s amazingly dumb sub removes “political” comments, refusing believe politicians responsible much failure respond virus. point can’t separate two, need stop pretending otherwise. Spent night Middlesex Hospital A&amp;E week back 

Think 90% maskless 

I'm surprised London well Covid atm loooool yes did!!! important people afraid? \+12126 new cases, 201 new deaths. Seven days average peak: 10982 cases 178 deaths. 


Excess deaths July alone 30k reporting less 6k Covid deaths. Economist says 6 times higher excess deaths Covid-19 deaths. 


700 healthcare workers memory list. instructed police state enforce masks guidelines directed local governments allowed make covid related regulations. part, China sought shift blame saying virus may originated elsewhere world surfaced Wuhan.

This part larger shifting narrative China distance COVID-19 outbreak. wonder mission play tbh. suprise. told us already manchen round 80% symptoms, also people symptoms get bad long term problems. 

if post stuff like people give shit gets even worse🤦🏻‍♂️ vaccines adverse reaction 1-3 months initial dosage. explained Counties different levels though, think people traveling across many different Cali counties congregate parks, coupled fact likely main demographic people would visit amusement park amidst pandemic likely people take virus seriously, seems like setup spread virus among counties, visitors travel back communities.

That’s guidelines leaked concerning reopening parks limited travel distance. distance effectively Southern California, least OC parks. Also, I’m sure familiar Southern California, basically Southern California completely connected it’s indistinguishable move one city next. Even though different administrative areas, there’s lot travel already goes orange county Los Angeles county among neighboring counties. Additionally, people traveling sorts reasons still, even places relatively low rates infection low numbers overall even come hard hit counties. 

Also, may correct attend amusement park, folks already public let tell rule breaking enforced elsewhere. Disney least shown willing confront patrons throw property refusing comply. see kind enforcement behavior businesses. actual rules enforcement place matter much anything else. doubt Trump isn’t well. saw multiple videos outside White House left hospital, wasn’t posing camera. struggling breathe. pretend symptoms either doesn’t anymore, dies. between. Pence abruptly changing plans — supposed Arizona Thursday afternoon — red flag otherwise trying pass calm serene environment. age-time-heatmap Germany last months  
shows exactly pattern Huh? look yourself...oh that's right, professionals speak anti lockdown get shadow banned blocked entirely/ridiculed others. 
 look properly find credible experts back article completely, viral experts risking entire future bring facts. There's 6000 them! 

Would like links? According ourworldindata Sweden tests around 5 times South Korea per capita. numbers China. three sessions room? think clear commenter best over-exaggerating situation. challenged provide proof. can't, reassess situation consider taking comment fairly clear claim making likely misinformation. Yet keep loosening restrictions heading colder weather...yaaaaay.... Sadly true sadly cure stupid! You’re going get downvotes you’re right astroturfing account. 7 years online, next karma, seems really opening Disney.

This Disney PR. upset elected officials trying save lives side big business.

Fuck front line cast members endanger families idiots think covid serious go get picture Mickey. mask requirements public still widely enforced compliance pretty much 100 percent

Well, 90 percent, count people also cover noses. Plenty bare nosed buffoons around. agree. information that's presented, presented poorly. ???? sarcastic? Wear fucking mask. Christ... dr either. articles bit annoying making huge claims sharing data. I'd love know many, any, got symptoms later could good news say... slow motion train wreck.

The terrifying part coronavirus cases control. terrifying part every single issue US going face going forward going turn massive crisis. Exactly this. Depressing really, let's cross fingers vaccines. see edit original comment? deaths sources compounded covid cases caused stress trying highlight. I'll leave you

**WHO official says estimate 10% world's population infected covid.**

*The head emergencies World Health Organization said Monday agency’s “best estimates” indicate roughly 1 10 people worldwide may infected math together?
Global population = 7.8 billion
10% 7.8 billion = 780 million
Total number deaths attributed covid = 1,060,929
1,060,929 = 0.136% 780 million
Covid IFR (infection fatality rate) 0.14%

According DR Anthony Fauci seasonal flu IFR 0.1%

*“The flu mortality rate 0.1 percent. mortality rate 10 times that. That’s reason want emphasize stay ahead game preventing this,”* fun. Dolphins don’t get near even non corona times hilarious also get covid Number cases means absolutely nothing looking long term data. first two months, get test literally pneumonia. next three months, symptoms get tested. august on, allowing absolutely anyone get test. real telling piece data deaths per day. remained virtually duration outbreak. Gotcha. I'm doctor. going numbers get fed trying make sense all. Yeah, everyone talks artists “Hollywood” fine money, don’t think 99% industry blue collar workers like set lights audio equipment catering. necessarily. Social distancing staying home much possible still good practice. 

Virus cant jump hosts hosts come close other. Seriously! work level one capital city docs paths still furlough, nurses pharmacists getting laid off, clinics getting shut closed multiple hospitals. fear mongering absolute garbage. ICUs may rate regularly sure, daily numbers house running 90% convivial Tuesday. fact matter is, hospitals US designed, budgeted, staffed, booked roomed run capacity. 96% daily life. it’s hard. Don’t feel bad medical professionals either, shit. hear doctors talk patient life. like, “Johnson 301? oh yeah, guy dying. hemoglobin crashing? Sweet, tell family soon. I’m going move comfort care. Hey, Jay. wanna lunch?”  GF Chinese.

Her total cost education per year $1000 one best universities China (essentially MIT). includes book lodging. city 10 million people.

Now understand course cost living differences price differentials. seriously... $1000? Per year? lookin say gladly found it. Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand laughable take. US already system place quickly distribute 100s millions vaccines every year... already flu... major vaccine candidates manufactured already scale. would likely able vaccinate every willing person mid-spring, 20% population probably Covid anyway.

 absence vaccine, would reach herd immunity far sooner 2022 regardless. 

Unless evidence claims, unnecessarily trying rile people unsubstantiated doomsday scenarios. There's zero chance Trump ever steps foot politics again. likely prison quite time. Along members family members cabinet..And stands right now, Republicans likely going diminish greatly coming elections. Infections deaths happen eventually, exactly what’s happening Europe now, shut prior delays surge, plus killing economy limiting everyone’s freedom making choice what’s best themselves. Mass majority people rather back normal lives Florida given choice, back work, school retail business. Hospitals never even close overwhelmed still see virus case flattened, experience fall surge virus, many regions force business close draconian measures ones seeing biggest surge. Florida inspiring leader many western regions follow handle situation best minimize overall negative impact. Well another call Sean Hannity tonight clearly hoarse stop times clear throat off-mic. seeing drop population?  Look superspreader Whitehouse. Come on, can’t serious. Suck loser. get remdesivir monoclonal antibodies decadron O2 suck up! Can't compare fighting human army fighting virus. Former definitely easy since humans tricked, argued, convinced etc. virus, otoh, like biological machine care stop gotta perfect win it. make us angry Pence took stage said administration's plan succeeded saved countless lives... Also Trump motto : coffee guy. know it’s pre-recorded? hate trump, I’d like sort “evidence” back claims up. Studies shown also interaction Americans’ stupidity. I'm Australian (living Sydney) appreciate support Australia pandemic response disagree idea 'get hung protecting civil rights'.

I'm proud Australian's acted society, collectively made sacrifices good around us, said society whole.

Civil rights opposite societal action. one LOVE freedom go life NSW limited risk contracting COVID-19. freedom enjoyed countries right now.

That's say perfect easy (my heart goes friends family Melbourne) - lockdowns worked Australian's believe support wider society live in. thing is, clear beginning, going silver bullet SARS-2, would relative failure viruses tried past.

The mechanism action exactly same. 

If going magic bullet, would already successful broad antiviral reagent works (+)ssRNA, (-)ssRNA dsRNA viruses. all.

So benefit, sure. game changer all. 

Gilead make ton money though Regardless whether believe virus man made whatever theories are, masks worn get sooner. Origin Americans. Yeah, too... YoULL NeVEr TaKe AwAY FrEeDoM!!! Except Florida, governor thinks exist, everything open, one wearing mask. 😡 Jesus christ. Even Australia basic laws need follow. fact they’ve criticized tough doesn’t mean don’t need protect civil rights well.

Some people sub treat ”civil rights” annoying obstacle, always way prefered policy. Straight totalitarian, dictatorial handbook. DeSantis also ok full stadium Miami Dolphin home game. Let sink in. could care less, words:

“I would tell people fact continue move forward economy doesn’t mean virus disappears,” DeSantis added.

“So people understand it’s something going deal don’t understand takes long western countries realize importance face mask seeing many success case Asian countries. probably endemic diseases ganged Covid beat shit it. forget give feed back replying bot

Standards high (pun intended) cancer (i think) severe illneses get medical recpit treatments work. Insight: Punishment widely different country. Berlin think 30g (but calculated strange like % thc raw Smoking stuff know also raw thc... best use 30g rule raw stuff) self use punishment therefore severe (Citation maybe right word? problems driver license big problem + money pay... smoke? Hah able Drive doctor ok smoke. drive smoking). changes drasticly example bavaria. 6g max self use. Im Berlin 30g bavaria 6g dealer get hefty Punishment, maybe jail. Also people react different, Berlin lf smoke police sees maybe say ""Boy stop go away"" look different Direction. bavaria hand kiss maybe ground, get cuffed real problems like flat searched etc. god forbid 6g Filthy Criminal scum junky.... 

With less trouble Berlin think g bavaria otherhand around 0,6g (not Search Flat mostly get Punishment moneywise, driver license always danger lf found something)

Lesson: smoke bavaria advice local mostly safe. Berlin rude much easier. 

Tldr: smoke pot germany vacation. really want Berlin bavaria (for safety). Drive NL enjoy coffeshops chocomel.

Bonus round: Berlin find Locals normal tourist buying zone (not görli). go görli ask Turkish looking guys africans better quality. Always money exchange stuff. Turkish man told often scamed people.

That's saying though. I'm saying shift graph match opposite narrative looking different timeframe stops valley first second peak, saying ""look close flu levels declining"". trying highlight fact here. saying something concerned about, is, understand perspective everything we've got peaks valleys belt there's real definitive conclusions drawn regarding settles. bot lord hates us now? 2020 rougher thought. Fun fact: mom got brother's doctor afraid seeing coughed phone 1. They're listening Trump capacity President United States, i.e. decider public policy. Whether agree not, ideas actions relevant.
2. listening scientists. People discuss contrasting ideas scientists various aspects pandemic, theraputics time.

The real quesiton getting ratioed/downvote innocent justified questioning Gate's role guys triggered emotional way, rather applying level critical thinking guys apply aspects pandemic Gates role/motivation. Trump charged knowingly spreading virus? speak country, Italy, since reopened schools, testing lot people. Especially children. little cough, little fever, little whatever basically, isolate test get result. Trump least 34 White House staff members contacts tested positive virus terms physical size, France largest country Western Europe.

Some people would tell Russia largest population, would suggest that's Western Europe. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article clue.

That seems like reasonable reopening plan. think parks pushed back wanted yellow instead Orange. 

And people dislike mileage requirement people would travel further. Anaheim resident, welcome state visitors while. I'll leave Berlin aren´t able make stricter measures politics. letting control. Australian - got almost seasonal flu year world standards, excellent healthcare, high trust doctors public health messaging, strong compliance social distancing initiatives. Additionally, nursing home outbreaks established risk, precautions implemented adhered across country. Exposing people virus met scorn shame.

All behaviours make transmission communicable disease much less likely. relatively mild climate throughout winter also helps. countries say citizens live context act accordingly, that’s think northern hemisphere nations indeed concerned winter influenza outbreaks. 

We also complete idiots either - get complacent flu vaccine schedule next months, could third wave April next year winter returns. I’m microbiologist 

who cares? claiming scientist refuse acknowledge opposing view, slapping tag ""nonsense"" "" fringe idea conservative"" people agree you. 

I pretty sure science works want true 

The matter fact care true, live place community transmission months.

Can ask American harsh lockdown like one NZ? Good luck culture ""freedom"". long? probably bearable 2 3 months virus going anywhere.

Man sounds absolutely miserable.


And I’m afraid not. Looking graph it’s kinda similar European countries. minute open things up, cases skyrocket they’re shut back down. good quality life there, I’d go insane Ruhrgebiet NRW cluster many big cities behave almost like Metropole big spike cases. cities like Aachen well suddenly increased much. Meat factories north west Germany problems again. recently tested positive covid, anyone else experienced nightmares? nightmares ever since symptoms. I’m sure it’s sort placebo it’s becoming little much I’m issues sleeping it. rest world article. Canada moving slower US. course virus would killed people even New Zealand like administration disgrace administration willingly called upon responsibility adequately intervening. therefore responsibility global death count place aside Brazil, administration considered responsible.

As reckless behavior think anyone else behaved same, going still positive, wearing mask, creating huge cluster top level government...we would prosecuted immediately. behavior direct personal responsibility national security issue. Start wearing mask house. Rest well, take vitamins. yes, get tested. Prison sheboygan responsible 400 cases Stress different effects people. [An answer Yeah sure, blame solely alternative people. people think 14,000 health experts petitioned lockdowns. Old news slowed Southern Hemisphere except Argentina. ""Coronavirus killing three times people flu pneumonia combined"" - British newspaper reports.

Fails report average age deaths Britain 82.4 years.

Average UK life expectancy 81.16 years say English?.....DUUUUUH!!! Possible reasons:

1. Information entered/read old version Excel, case extra rows added would thrown error.
2. newer version Excel file saved old format, would asked user happy lose data.
3. sort collating program reads data produces XLS file, case program produced error.

The first 2 users ignoring error messages. 3rd dodgey programming.

Either way, using better software data analysis Excel. China - 1

Actually, europe doesn´t makes thing political. ask, european leader behaves anything close trump, isn´t one. guess is, aftermath holiday season young people tired isolated. Dude, parrot one asked is, trainer. trainer answered parrot, ""grey"". 

Dunning-Krueger full effect. good points, Newsom going super cautious everything opening up. really screwed restaurant industry summer first allowing open indoors huge laundry list requirements maintain social distancing shut indoor dining right restaurants spent ton money meet original demands.

I think would OK open Disneyland way Disney World opened FL. really dangerous, hospitals Orlando would completely overwhelmed general public would took notice, spite whatever attempts DeSantis would done cover things up.

Personally I’m staying away amusement parks pandemic over. There’s many people would get fed wear mask entire day. Masks important btw. weekend get real cold Germany, mean almost frost Bavaria. cat, dogs, hamsters, mink, monkeys, etc catch coronavirus. Cats seems one affected animals many cases reported around world, dogs much. 

Minks farms interesting cases. SARS-CoV-2 rips like wildfire, [jumping humans animals mutating jumps. think says lot proximal origin coronavirus. would recommend self-isolate right away reach close contacts past two weeks get tested. Loss smell highly specific indicated Covid, reliable symptoms, see helps research also suggest particular symptom associated milder disease course. Take care. company cars? drive around AC EN number plate. Semi-related: friends who've stopped eating Subway Jared Fogel arrested CP charges, despite leaving Subway gig years prior. Let’s honest 200k strict lockdown way way 400k. lot people fight restrictions guess “every man phase” stay home others stopped caring. No, PR bratty USSR also talked closures livelihoods inability gather mourn God bless summer time! Really bad gastronomes. mean cold war vibes? Generally large sections, yes. theme parks also huge numbers indoor attractions, waiting areas lines cramped. Even staff cautious constantly cleaning, thousands people touching things. thousands people walking air wait line.

People also eating drinking park. can’t guarantee wash hands. touch mask constantly throughout day. touch everything come contact park. People screaming yelling rides, plenty people shitty masks. virus travel much farther 6 feet, especially someone screaming.

I’d say biggest issue bathrooms though. thousands people using small spaces- lines bathrooms already issue this. 

You also figure- winery going mostly adults, sitting one location quietly. theme park entire families, children. Children aren’t exactly known hygiene. Children age 2 aren’t even required wear mask, doesn’t mean can’t spread it. They’re going touching everything, getting saliva everything. many children coming places person school, chance they’ve infected drastically higher.

Theme parks might safe. personally I’d much rather take chance socially distant, quiet winery theme park. Iowa checking here. started never started. Thanks Kim Reaper! would sore shoulders here! 

He feeding anti-mask culture speech. think possible?

  OK, people want see shows? considered? public events like sports concerts. apply schools, work places, shopping centers private gatherings. women vocal, policy debates key areas coverage, often face online harassment second-guessing expertise, several female scientists told Washington Post. 

This deeply saddening, especially best responses pandemic female leaders (ex. Jacinda Ardern NZ Tsai Ing-Wen Taiwan). Also, quite public health agencies exceptionally well headed women. safe so. Especially cases rise everything. think made *right* decision. 1,184 cases yesterday 5 million population, really bad. human fetal stem cells anywhere process medication. company stuff human fetal stem cells, quite frankly there's nowhere use kind treatment. misled people accidentally purposely mistook company using fetal stem cells mean used treatment. treatment uses antibodies extracted recovered covid patients genetically modified mice, pluripotent adult skin cells chinese hamster ovaries stepping stones. I'm kind USSR flashbacks help neighbouring countries beds. Sure lot people work home. Sending everyone home able work home seems like pretty good solution additional 50% go! also long COVID immunity last? appears rising community spread hope retaining K-12 classrooms, need give bars eat-in restaurants.

(Of course we’d united country by, say, May observing public health protections, we’d likely able kids safe classrooms now.) Schools going back weeks. lost mom November nursing home ""mysterious lung illness"" presented pneumonia flu combined. I've wondering. Let's start selling Sputnik vaccine generate profits. sure bad, sure would call stupid would argument. think widespread phenomenon, couple loons? Please use critical thought. Sputnik IV huh guys? live Green Bay essential working. got covid back July. I’m worried I’m going get again. work banks travel 13 different buildings around Wisconsin. People incredibly ignorant refusing wear masks. Bars packed, restaurants full... feel hopeless. Wait. Tile tell actual results would reduce immediate demand ICU beds cost deaths long term. 

More deaths long term? predicted March 2020 response covid-19 broad lockdown, **opposed focus shielding vulnerable** members society 

And maybe assumption predict policymaking, assumed interventions implemented demand ICU beds reaches particular “trigger” level. 

So, protect vulnerable people, take action many people sick, get total deaths. Switzerland know like one person died, like 85 years old, virus extremely overrated 14 people know catched sick day two

No one know cares covid, still wear masks though, expected, good idea, surely better another lockdown who's fault PPE limited?Many countries issue. Ebola still big issue Africa. saying mainly limited Africa big deal? lethality covid constantly downgraded plenty infectious disease deadly Covid, TB. Right now, pretty obvious well established treatment covid 98 plus percent survival rate. That's...not works. anything

How many people die call something bloodbath? Another thousand? Perhaps 200,000 more? FL, AL, etc going overrun. Almost every single area entire US experience low normal hospital capacities. ""hard hit"" places experience surge comparable bad flu season ALWAYS faded within &lt; 4 weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst flu season past ten years killed 65,000 Americans one year, 12 months, 365 days.

Covid killed 65,000 Americans March 1st April 30th. That's 2 months. 60 days.

The reason outbreaks slowed divine intervention fricken voodoo black magic, measures taken slow spread virus strain medical infrastructure. going keep head sand this, that's call, keep stop lazily spreading lies misinformation strangers. You’re right. general population won’t get year. didn’t even read article states enough 1/3 first responders, possible manufacturing months already. Dude take step back look wrote. sound like unhinged comic book villan Turn tide? 30 odd thousand people died NY. literally burned way vulnerable population there. Every country Russia US great. think ""wasted"" right term miss disease everybody including bill gates told coming...you know disease gave two trial runs (SARS MERS) showing up... LOL, imagine locked vulnerable people everyone else went nuts month. -\_- always look constipated praying ? fish always stinks head. Right, goes show banning travel China pointless. dashboard says 1800 suspected cases total. site 42,000 verified numbers. That's weird take.

We know that, young child, COVID dangerous flu. Would call parents worry flu ""bad parents""? People freaking can't seem understand anyone could possibly predict vastly increasing worldwide population predictably lead pandemic.

After trump got rid pandemic response team, course scientists tried start working predictive models.

But get section society little better han torch baring masses figures someone points obvious elephant room, must CAUSED instead smart enough point out.

Its big leap reasoning figure large interconnected worldwide population tons dense ares ideal pandemic spread. look every zombie movie disease outbreak movie ever made.  censorship gotten control reddit management needs crack vaccines widely available administered, imagine thats ways Man really don’t give Hahaha. thing Trump White House psychopaths worried grifting money, installing Trumps friends cronies like guys running Veterans Affairs, destroying environmental regulations unprecedented never-before-seen pace, William Barr breaks law every day Donald Trump Mitch McConnell actively prevents useful bills hitting senate floor, 3 SEPARATE ELECTION SECURITY BILLS So... saying you’re trying start shit.
I suggest go back comment trying start shit edit that, know, truth. love irony here. lot excess deaths could lockdown/fear catching virus causes, like lack cancer screenings though. Indirectly caused COVID, virus itself. noticed people outside usual today though, even chilly weather drizzling. seems like Germans trying milk last days...because winter coming -\_- Oh didn’t know releasing data working well? And? I'm Minnesota 3 4 neighbors. Damn. true, chinese population surely developed insane immunity every scientist planet would calling comprehensive studies.

At least would months every scientist planet begging china release info well.

This news would like australia suddenly announcing generate energy past 48 hours magically found way divine free energy thin air 

It's bonkers. green, stop drinking creme de menthe work. whole point medical science postpone death.

Any physician believes postponing death worthy pursuit get medical profession. talk travel ban would actually made difference. virus world. Banning travel China absolute bare minimum could done, ofcourse that’s happens president thinks firing people get rid problems. Lazy ineffective leadership got us mess, China. [English bother him. source results name calling point out. blame problem unique conservative Republicans everyone else. Fuck Thank you, too. Politics country truly disgusts made disillusioned voter. We're damned damned don't. registered democrat say wolves sheeps clothing. Everything comes monied interests end. Ok, I'll break down. First foremost, point Utah County driving current surge cases EXACTLY health experts saying. disagree that, disagree health experts. seem problem with.

Your larger point appears driven lack education interpret large datasets. That's insult way; people spend entire career make sense huge sets data. have, I'll explain case counts important.

This new surge started last week August. Hospitilizations, per health experts, lag 2 weeks behind new cases, deaths lag 4 weeks behind new cases average. means, hospitilizations deaths Utah County surge begun. Conversely, Salt Lake County's hospitilizations deaths largely driven surge saw Memorial day. is, look OVERALL numbers, comparing surge already come control one still rapidly developing. developing surge obviously affect numbers counties.

When look data, see new case count predictor future hospitilizations, new hospitilizations predictor deaths. looking saying ""well yeah, good!"" agree. surge late August, Utah County pretty good! wearing masks local accounts, weren't, relatively little community spread. Now, however, uncontrolled community spread worried high daily case count fearing hospitilizations deaths look like coming weeks.

And lastly, care club arguments literally one condoning behavior. Literally one starting fights airplanes behavior. Literally one claiming going club causing pass out. Literally everyone except idiots clubs saying clubs closed altogether even enforced mask mandate. problem, problem people writing misinformation conspiracy theories.

You're cherrypicking statistics scare you, natural, whataboutism stop. True I'm stating opinions think Utah County susceptible spike cases, that's largely besides point (hence fly shit pepper comment). point spike cases that, taken seriously, going run county huge increase hospitilizations deaths. Ignoring relatively unaffected far dangerous.  Right wing media Murdoch FAR FAR toxic major outlets. See Politifact above. point information warfare. left respond kind, get completely steamrolled. Compulsory ""Where god now!?""  Definitely heavy self selection bias. survey percentage positive comes higher riskiest risk groups medical workers, survey results clearly biased. R U S!
R U S!
R U S! that. Korea changed entire pandemic response dealing MERs. made huge impact, prepared deal head on...whereas US, dismantled response team 2018. -\_-

&amp;#x200B;

A lot leadership. help Koreans highly educated. view goal killing brown peoples, combined facts make sense. anyone like you? like reporting Russia China's vaccines made sound like dangerously gave without concern safety, reality phase 3. noted Russia one countries successfully came vaccines smallpox successfully eradicated disease country. vaccine research joke, excellent doctors researchers cause. We're still shamed lot fellow countrymen states. Morale abysmal. exhausting. knew early NYC’s first (and massive) outbreak linked Italian clade. seems unsurprising. Pretty sure california alone topped numbers knew 5 families vacationed dakotas didn’t wear masks (eyeroll) there! China doorknob Damnit Russia! That's record yours! Ultimately responsible yourself, can't go life saying ""It media's fault I'm shit!"" Fuck you, Gov. I'm 32 still cannot get bed reasonable hour fact I've getting worse lately definitely agree point there. One things hate Reddit false elitism. lot redditors pretend Reddit different they're anonymous. act like they're elite social media users content internet starts yet there's multiple subs dedicated reposting junk platforms. There's bot dedicated reposts much content unoriginal. Society gone pretty sad road try separate social media platforms fake class structure.

""We buzzing flies Vigo!"" truth COVID-19: China covers virus outbreak Chinese spread virus around world also Falling Window category? ""the window opportunity"" Like eating less meat? LOL OH BOY. crying comes one. talk two staff members this. first great think fine actually generally really careful. continues wear mask nose, driving boss crazy. I'm happy either, I'm stressed caught middle. talked week since warned multiple times, sent email follow cc'ed supervisor. can't get this. know boss feels way. I'm sure else do. Sigh, wish people Berlin followed rules more. -\_- cab drivers tell need wear mask employees sometimes wear them...there ALWAYS asshole public transportation wear one. Right upset knew that. reopened everything. Gyms movie theaters bars restaurants shops DISCOS. Everything opened except one thing: schools.

Then 3 weeks ago reopened schools say hello second wave.

Shut damn schools. USA: Hold beer. Actually, yes. Members local election commissions typically 50+ women, mostly school teachers.

Whenever possible, autocrats prefer use many fake ballots. without massive public support, choice left. USA far guilty counts. people claim care much hate filled.  look odd may deepfake ??? thought exist lol Yes nothing says capitalism like state forcing businesses close. Yeah... Reddit likes pretend it’s fighting good fight number redditors wishing harm Russia China says otherwise. Holy fuck don’t go bar! anyone even asking question? stick hand blender it’s bad? Fuck!!!!! literally gave dating, 75% women encounter either overweight borderline obese.


And people wonder men look younger women. Literally every single woman work besides 1 close obese get hard people follow basic rules. seems like even wearing mask enclosed spaces social distancing hard people. -\_- Even us followed that, would difference. company knowingly sold baby powder asbestos decades?

No one sees problem that?

That perhaps company ethical integrity participate this?

They've getting smashed know part. true possibility epidemic start China. know places show spike pneumonia-like symptoms quite early on. Also, creating propaganda make false accusation new thing US. narative, well, perspective, actually favorable China time. could China. bats. plague happen naturally, happened quite times time China unlucky one. 

But officals China made aggressive statements toward Australia. mean appears suspicious, right? something sensitive needed hidden. mean still definite proof, far it, also natural China highest posibility ground zero, drama saw, right? give ivermectin dogs heart worm prevention. Damn red mask jacket combo sick though. 😬 trolling. ridiculous thing I've ever seen here.

Shall give Nobel Peace Prize implies others peaceful? 

Looking history, looks like Republican pathological drive try say sides same. I'm guessing protects psychologically cognitive dissonance would wise experience knowing supporting bad side. say. second thought, perhaps value freedumb health, would best move them. takes hospitalization data COVID tracking.com makes easier view. lag couple days though think good year get hard data working home productivity. company, starting notice slipping, along accuracy.

Edit: currently 50/50 guess I’m one confused Dr. involved issued Note: Dr. Wright issued clarification report, saying state could vaccine early November 10 state contacted city's health department haven’t heard anything state yet we’ll getting vaccine, than, tell us, point we’re going vaccine, need planning it. So, internally, we’ve started whole planning process get ready this. looking what’s said drug companies manufacturing this, they’re producing vaccine time they’re testing vaccine. vaccine works, will, FDA, ask approval, get approval, ship out, ship fairly quickly, they’ve already got made.” -Dr. Wright flu cancer. It’s season death. want point travel ban various countries. Banning Americans entering brainer. women children make better slaves fascism men likely think definitely could better job handling pandemic, Canada 100% better neighbours south.

US total cases / 1 million population - 23,758

US total deaths / 1 million population - 659



Canada total cases / 1 million population - 4697

Canada total deaths / 1 million population - 253


Exaggerate much friend? can't compare that. extremely dependant whole testing situation.  Okay. And? still way less contagious measles. They’re comparable. (The measles killed 2.6 million people worldwide 1980, example, even vaccine available many countries) bavaria (south germany) Count proper Mouth-nose cover. useable/allowed grocerie Shopping public transportation etc. specific, want live southeast... predominantly conservative. doubt describing apply Appalachia. I'm sure meant reply someone else. true disorders like hypothyroidism, PCOS, etc make weight loss difficult (though impossible).

I'm saying see ""diets damage metabolism"" myth lot that, myth. There's lot defeatism around weight management bothers all.  many travel shut downs hell talking about?

It's impossible completely shutdown interstate travel. even US? mean far ""what done""? learn anything this?

Did lock quickly enough? all?

What options slow down? Wow France beat Russia real men make stupid excuses can't wear condom. also real men take condom middle sex without consent person. called ""stealthing."" new cases reported Italy continue increase tenth consecutive week cumulative incidence (ISS flow data) last 14 days 44.37 per 100,000 inhabitants (period 21/9 - 4/10) (vs 34.2 per 100,000 inhabitants period 14/9 - 27/9).

That's Google translate. algebra it. tomorrow numbers new sanity check answer. 

A+b= 44.37
B+c= contained paragraph. current week, b last week, c week before.

Edit : damn, town US much worse
Rip us grow up? provide evidence like Aussie fella? NZ time someone moshpit covid too. lucky big spread concert. Yeah that's meant say getting better treatment, presume?

Vitamin levels havent lowered yet.  Wait months... would pandemic. Better hope fire nice enough trapped room. 20-40 year old isolate wait vaccine ? nonsense answer depend whether live country closer communist country like China, closer democracy like United States. tells everything need know really. similar experience going Bay Area mom's house rural Trump-loving area near Tahoe. There's strong correlation two. Grandma kids dude? [no, 50  US asks hold beer, tell sit hell down. Lol didn’t think possible see dumber comment sub I’m proven wrong every day. can't expect wear condom. dick fall off.""

I cannot believe real nationwide shut down? travel shut states? Therefore making staggered lockdowns pointless. realize vaccine right? treatment. We're totally fucked 330 million citizens need this. certainly wear mask public socially distance people indefinitely. everyone. People act like difficult drive nuts. deaths staying low now

Maybe terms hard numbers, look growth well. know everyone satisfied ""deaths still low"" NL Oct. 6/7/8 saw 70 dead equivalent time September saw 3. good trend, improving. Covid public health problem, sort biological attack. surprising systems biodefense see coming. keep hydrated. get Pedialyte? Ohh, dumbass thinks passage time would trick... duhhh! Karens would like speak manager outliers. So? know people infected implement measures based that. I've heard pole tax, re-dick-ulous.

(I'll see out...) tax return Aus allowed claim $300 home work expenses  I'm worried country (Canada) regard. :( though, plus people arriving European countries, clubs open, masks mandated outside, people stopped social distancing. seeing happened summer went completely control damn fast *won't fucking whistle guy wearing chin diaper thumbnail making angry 
ಠ_ಠ don’t listen guy you’ll good, op That’s UK’s current Rt, effective reproduction number, virus’s basic reproduction number. mean surrounded water.... need good pumps good extinguish fire fuck happen? Approved vaccine US. I’m entirely sure going FDA seems like keep putting roadblocks prevent vaccine approved election ie whatever happening Oxford one EU/Canada rolling approval.

When theFDAshould follow science. data approve it, don’t. Ah, sounds like it’s dependent type positions. mostly entry level data entry type positions, would assume? 

My job couldn’t outsourced since work med devices. Don’t forget people either willfully ignorant idiots touch reality, and/or selfish assholes don’t really care others die result shitty actions. gonna lie, American, plenty times times people (including brothers) made want scream still believe european countries honest cases. 

Could wrong, country serious everything going right now. Releasing numbers everyday, showing many ICU, hospitals etc. 

Overall, I'm pleased woth countries overall reaction corona, compared much wealthier powerful countries. happen? thought vaccine? /s are. Testing capacity massively increased. Hospitals fine. There's strain capacity. We're seeing true number infections data now. March/April saw fraction true number infections testing data. 100 000 true infections per day manageable society stay open. Much widespread would proper access mental health services. shame loners critical thinking skills.   actually work healthcare done rotation CU know work. don’t know claims referring provider shortages NY, friend went. shortage resources concerning beds. Healthcare providers fucking died! One would hope there’s limit stupidity, November awful close. Better hope never fire medical emergency island. Back April/May, said, states locked down. US policy like made state level. There's plenty pro-lockdown posts said shut entire country down, can't hunt clearly new here. Won’t happen, struggle enforce it. Country tired. weeks away full scale riots! difference talking oneself making everything oneself. care nothing country people, fine, leave threads like alone. Dont flood discussion issues, people actually care France That’s nice. obviously concerned profits lives. 
Or, infringing companies patents want get in-front litigation go FDA approvals.

Probably nice guys. Fascinating. par course various French presidents 50% even 60% disapproval ratings point terms. complex thing, depends various things like political system history country. year? Dayumn humans scary! we're Covid-strucked country there. turned access badges except security, unfortunately. displeasure pee I'm saving plastic grocery bags order make necessary cuts expenses associated flushing would done work! Many districts still hybrid virtual. going this, UK source. r value estimates vary some— even assuming high number right, taking high end measles R well, means measles still 3x contagious. transmissibility two isn’t comparable. Measles SUPER contagious. Getting divorced. either move cop dad thinks wearing mask stupid, gone bars without wearing mask recent weeks going Florida days next week. moving two Trump loving aunts COPD always hacking lung, think masks stupid hoax. Wish luck cause either way I'm fucked. Definitely not. 😊 could've eradicated virus like NZ crumbling economy allow us it, plus Mafia practically taking government failed arrive, people wanted little natural serotonin almost 3 months consuming benzos ""indoor dining"" spot I've visited past 8 months kitchen.

I'm suffering serious hamburger-and-fries withdrawal. too. dichotomy presented person Lol. Smartass. kind wish right point. Guess remove existing sick pay now. Yayyy Broadway might real big trouble. starting lose major parts history I'm fully WFH, husband partially so. cannot meet expectations employees young children home. That's reality. You’ve made stance sub doesn’t exist. 

Ok. United States lockdown?  Aww yeah! Im healthcare worker. Inject shit! true. many strains flue new ones every year. everyone getting shot could possibly eliminate individual strains. guess conceding it’s scientifically proven.

But question false dichotomy. “Fur dead infected animals processed remove traces virus used coats garments, according Fur Commission USA, mink farming trade group. U.S. produces 3 million mink pelts year.”
Imagine seeing guy full hazmat suit processing limited edition 2020 Covid-mink fur. That’s op said Reality going years continue go way anything back office related AP/AR, payroll, shared services getting offshored india, costa rica, portugal name it. things go away though still going customer facing roles well roles analytical nature (even considered ""back office"" support functions). guarantee outsourcing FPNA consolidations bound GAAP SEC filing requirements etc. guarantee orgs looking outsource things deemed ""easy"" repetitive.

There attempt well development side, companies soon realized took time fix issues arising offshore people literally things based decision tree, ask analyze make call something. feel like comments contradict rest thread. one hand, people say highly contagious, other, thing lockdowns enough China get rid disease, even though work anywhere else.

Why pretend China's #s accurate? skin game, obviously wrong. can't accept move on? hardwired expendable.

Few people talk closing workplace fatality gap. 25 certainly sounds reasonable 100 goal encourage test candidates. Okay ExplainittomelikeIamfive...cloth masks emit particles. fibers stop emitted washed? Help please takeaway me, cloth mask user? BC did. Masks ""encouraged"" elementary kids, heavily suggested mandatory junior high highschool.

My sister friend worth elementary schools different districts. young children wearing masks. pandemonium. sister's healthy far (tiny country school Island), teacher friend (bigger school small city) two weeks sick (tested negative) lot teachers falling ill too. They're incredibly stressed October. Uncounted covid deads, i'm pretty sure. lot deaths revised added total log, like city Manaus one first cities affected Brazil, 100 deaths added one day State say anything media asked wtf happened.

We lot deaths counted SARS, beggining afford test already deceased, mostly healthcare collapsed first wave.

A source deaths Manaus (in portuguese):
 ""The record log deaths Covid-19 Government Amazonas March September incorrect. 24% deaths recorded correctly, says Intercept Brazil."" even moved ban homeschooling? Ludicrous. Thought found Carmen Sandiego first barely remember.... bordered 2 sides country currently run cult. much higher March/April France New York. extremely hard compare. gotta look hospitalizations, that's reliable number. Half sons elementary school sick 2 weeks ago 2 weeks flu. let kids take masks class, let wrestle other, let go massless outside wrestling around recess. I've told son dozens times, unless teacher enforce it, isnt going stop. 

This Canada btw. Even are, nobody cares EU elections. Same. I’m ready! suppose see closed today sanitize everything since Friday, cautious. happen canada unless 100% stop travel states. otherwise canadian yahoo visit american family florida bring back fresh rona you. Universities wish government. high school students adults able act like adults go school take precautions without becoming breeding ground virus like adults workplace. No, we're fine. U.S. also tests *significantly* France. per capita test rates U.S., number would almost certainly much bigger. like used dialysis patients estimate 10%? Yeah, there’s nothing magical classroom “learning environment.” fact, sometimes worse ton distractions. It’s expectations teacher sets follow expectations that’s effective. kid would rather write sentences play.

I really feel parents, said. know sucks. many find hard get kids work, don’t. WH staff took care grass Covid measures, even pay landscaping company You’ve literally brought nothing new table hasn’t contested elsewhere sides terms science keep calling “murder” like animals care isn’t. You’ve made actual difference vegan, want act like better person makes feel better.

I’m done here. You’ve accomplished nothing, killing animal eat isn’t murder, want use human-engineered term apply animal kingdom. Animals alive not, don’t concept murder. Running animal combine way frightening humanely ending existence, guarantee you, I’ve seen it. 

But trying convince vegan obviously like trying reach moon hand, I’m done. US big, diverse country, it’s hard make blanket statements hospitalizations. Wisconsin right setting field hospital hospitals filling believe Idaho sending COVID cases states beds. Clearly hotspots lot hospitals bigger problem flu season fully upon us. I'm concerned virus setting stamina back. I've recently running best average time per mile goal triathlon next year. covid fucks lungs im gonna pissed. fucked here.  last four years outside observer taught anything America land double think. announced plan [host another  No... like ""My wang-tax rate 35%"" instead of, ""Here's nickle- pud."" basically almost assured. Today score what, 7000? I'm sure cherry picked anti mask motives Hard prevent entire rest US infecting announced plans [host another findings seem apply HOMEMADE cotton masks. commercial masks. Bait. I've trouble re-finding source (sorry), 0.022% IFR Seasonal Influenza read - would make COVID 20x deadlier. Maybe H1N1 data /u/Compsky mentions below... makes interactions school dangerous interactions? understand schools wearing masks enforcing social distancing. wear masks socially distance family dinners? actually seems like high risk scenario me. understand term ""selection bias""?

Is foreign concept understand? 

I explain want. vitamin sense, huh. fun rising sea levels. islands limited lifespan U.S. much, much higher testing rate France, like almost twice high per capita according Statista numbers posted today.

If anything, France's numbers could higher. best time Christie's governorship time state.

man, string awful governors lifetime. Christie Murphy actually 2 best we've had. Ever dookie sneeze? bizarre act politicizing it, even keep saying won’t let science get politicized I'm living area GOP leaning, ""recall Newsom"" posters en masse, Nextdoor. go Disneyland pandemic, understand ""the responsible"" people would like reopen beloved area gather -- much like reopened Tokyo Florida.

What *is* wrong set guidelines would allow opening. Without set published guidelines, Disneyland hope reopen, whim Newsom. fact Governor allowed much power (see states fight), concern citizens CA.

Disneyland Knotts *want* reopen, people *want* go there, others simply avoid areas altogether. Newsom needs publish guide would allow parks hint would take reopen, internally within park, externally city/county. status Sputnik V vaccine? approved months ago, widespread data safety &amp; efficacy yet? Toxic masculinity ruins party again. March 30th, NYS 9,298 positive cases, also 49.9% positivity rate. two weeks positivity rate 40%. 

Lots missed cases, obviously, enough testing. Cumulative numbers since beginning meaningless. Cumulative numbers last 14 days shows trend daily cases shows current situation. experiencing wave 2 basically meaningless include numbers March. Additionally, every country level preparedness whereas beginning taken surprise efficient testing skewed numbers one way other. (I realize many places still fucking up)

100k better one million that's basically official health institutions show case rates. fine use 1 million, 100k norm.

Just saying, want picture current situation, believe people want, use 14 day daily cases. never understood desire testing.

All matters people getting sick. sick, matter infected not.

The thing really needs tracking local hospital. ICUs full, there's problem. Somebody nominate Putin Noble Peace Prize count reaches 20,000 per day, can't invade countries soldier
are sick dying - Peace ta da. One proposed guidelines got leaked last week residency limit 120 miles order attend. don’t think that’s unreasonable restriction all, although definitely hurt people, take is. said, idea travel would allowed given kind guideline, especially cents reservations would required ahead time, technically non-issue. saw wearing it, think cool. number look pretty low me. meta-analysis 24 different studies came 0.68% (0.53-0.82%) English study says 0.49% using one data source 0.3% using another. reported 0.6%, mid-August still listing 0.5 - 1%. Seems like don’t Mac mittens either want jam, slam  closer 0.03%, yes, idea same. Covid 1 order magnitude deadly flu. I'm confused. research confirms cotton masks stop small particles? reject advice, rejecting *science*; is, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Offit, Spanish doctor MarketWatch... Sad :( 1%? Where’d get fucked number from?

Those “most risk” means they’re likely going die catch I’m 39 Asthma, need go hospital, pretty much coasted right it. husband hand, who’s 41 without Asthma, hospital 8 days, extremely poorly one point, unable get o2 saturation 80%. almost exact story one female friends also 39. can’t protect “most risk.” It’s clear everyone’s immune system acts completely different. Unless you’re Donald Trump. Covid makes feel 20 years younger, course. Corona related popular belief, contrast Russia US needs check bank account deciding even go doctor faced mild symptoms. actually looks like shrewd business move me. revolutionary technology works, better publicity could get open anyone wants use it, helping broadly prove effectiveness acceptance getting play ""hero"" pandemic. They're maintaining rights technology future vaccines bank improved publicity exposure push forefront future vaccine purchases. wonder they'll \*really\* enforcing this. Even certain neighborhoods flouting rule since beginning recently protest it? I'm doubtful tbh. hard compare months ""lol stupid Americans, Europe already beat this.""

(I'm saying we're great job here, btw.) Lancet obligation publish something like this, I'm sure million opinions million scientists would refuse publish, advance discussion, least acceptable way, doesn't. We're talking Twitter, we're talking platform supposed carry scientific weight, even science, scientist's scientists (we know) opinion. somebody ostensibly qualified thought drivel actually worth publishing, that's scary statement state scientific community right now. Yes there's also people big cities little ones, obviously. Let's say there's 50 cities size Harrisburg 10%. Chicago would still bring average little.

I think consensus there's like ten times actual cases confirmed. That's 70 million, like... guessed it, 20%.  key difference living virus, whereas Australia going annihilation. makes sense NZ Taiwan since they’re islands. 

All countries list living virus continue get flare ups said. 

I 100% support lockdowns early days, it’s obvious eradication possible. economic downturn going bad too. article literally proves point. Different “lock downs” different dates travel “restrictions” honor system quarantine yourself.

I’m starting think don’t even know I’m saying. Netherlands, Czech Republic, France, U.K. case spikes right equal surpass America's biggest daily spike (adjusted population). pretty crazy. orange one convinced people effective put lot extra effort dispel myth. prayed real crisis would happen Trump President worst fears came true. idiot exactly assumed would do. I'm almost certain try appease liberal minded vaccine hesitant people. reach people want take think microchipped Gates Foundation people scared rushed election might change minds. still raise question one layer up.

- hospitals get lot new material seems

- tracking app failed ?

this citizens duty political level mistakes worth looking “i want start going back normal” gf says

“dafuck?” - me

reference: smokes smoker cough, copd  say massive protests nationwide held earlier? Actually percentage positive test results rising steadily time. question tests percentage would remain flat. Yes poor high school students 19 years old cannot left alone house.
Or people universities 25+.

Of course totally necessary reopen schools... come on. Imagine sexist. Idk one chief Yes there's also less people rural areas. Let's say there's 50 cities size Harrisburg 10%. Chicago would *still* bring average little. That's cool, sure ofAMERICA DEF SOMETHING LOOK willing take mask eat inside sharing air unknown people AIRBORNE virus pandemic full swing....

Tell em Fauci conclusion: get fucked think vocals already declining anyway, songs like Ticks Leeches don’t seem particularly healthy respect. Saw live 2016 voice definitely isn’t 20 years ago. Still sucks Covid might decline, though. Wishing best! Well, Europe spike summer like US did. second wave expected. We're boat, difference American government danger public safety. co-morbidities? guess need guy testers. Thanks stepping front line!

Yup. try force back classroom, I'll quit. Yes, noted, small sample. 

What indicate *assume* due C-19 instead actually get data. would require someone research - perhaps something suggest hospital got inside track. don't, repeatedly frustrated claims excess deaths virus-related. There's least evidence suggest significant portion not, wait data making claims? That's I'm asking. continual rise ticket prices beyond inflation made really poor value compared vacation destinations. least could justify going days year making sure pick day parks open longest cant imagine paying whole family go especially limitations now.

Until there's vaccine least reliable, powerful treatment infections safety simply today, tinder-dry tree got close fire.

The disease going away. try go away disease.

Barriers like mask wearing, sanitation, social distancing. Failure equals ending another statistic. Millions die everyday multitude things yet continue normal.   Travel literally cannot shutdown. Stop whining impossible happening. People people right here. family members cult I'm weird one following science. 

I may cut contact permanently move overseas.

I’m phase III trial unless severe reaction small amount saline, side effects would indicate given ‘live’ vaccine. research data released indicate one success, believe it’s already started rolling approvals overseas. It’s changed little life. I’m still required wear masks, I’m still required practice social distancing. It’s like go concert theatre. thing wouldn’t went back gym, wear mask it’s required. majority vaccinated, nothing changes. Man freaked first heard it, hope it’s true Hit it, Rockapella! asked national. You’re clearly paying attention. 

I said state lockdowns don’t matter travel can’t shut down. 

Thanks proving idea I’ve saying entire time. it’s important make stance person you’re talking to. Canada’s health care ran tax payers money.

While hear good things vaccines truth don’t know far away one.

If go 2021 virus shut downs that’ll two years row hospitals lost money due shut downs that’ll effect 2023. Hospitals currently fine since Canadians working 2019 paid taxes. 

However budget 2021 probably cut bit since people work spring. 

It’s really economy prioritized health care rather two interconnected one another, shut economy pretty much screw hospitals following year. world would better place America large version florida. 28% U.S. parents Christian nationalists detached reality. read french there's detailed (pdf file) every week.     
There's study clusters page 15. seems, clusters workplace, followed educational institutions (from pre-school university), different health centers.     
Insterestingly, ""public private temporary gathering"", guess includes bars restaurants, 4th place 10%.    
The prisons disavantaged people (homeless, illegal aliens...) lower thought too. 200,000+ dead would like word really matter, cities virus spreads russia significantly bigger cities US even.

Moscow 12.5 million inhabitants 150% population density cities like LA, size alone mean anything people crowded small european part country. government help us darkest hour, fuck paying taxes? Downvote want, phantom downvoter. Even casual perusal /r/coronavirus backs pessimism. I've said, certainly hope I'm wrong, anyone reasonable sense perspective see future look like there's going real progress long time. said reply, weather Saturday high 70s near 80. large parties place assuredly last warmth like we’ll get. Nobody takes serious near hasn’t gotten bad immediate area. led complacency could lead serious issues coming months, weeks. Guess we’ll know couple weeks.

Edit: interestingly enough, really nice 2 weeks ago many parties neighborhood, imagine spike expected. Hold seats Ohio, it’s going wild ride! Trump: ""Hold beer."" seem number significantly lower period 2018 due reduction coronial autopsy requests following sudden natural deaths (appendix).

We're taking small subset deaths autopsying them, noting many fewer autopsies requested. even sample 67.

Why every death target area getting representative sample? would hard. nobody asked us (John Radcliffe Hospital, case) aren't.

The note drug-related deaths worth remembering though. Drug-related deaths (essentially caused poverty) rising years, year going time high US. pandemic causes poverty, expect rise next year well. Ew thats awful. People gross lol cant believe someone thinks good idea drinking fountain running Agreed reason wanted go Swedish way became somehow concerned, mostly bc hospitals overflowing.

This time around literally spreading nonsense justify plowing 😟.

Also locks selective .. went away. CLAP CLAP lot synergies working office translate working home. in-office benefits network externalities now. Remote work benefit network externalities enough companies adopt it, significant percentage company works home.

I've working remote like five years.

I missed chit chat ""let's grab beer"" stuff. everyone home there's lot ""this 15 minute call includes least 10 minutes hanging making fun Oracle dumb memes whatever."" great. I'm actually closer people random projects together came chummy time. Good you. Going graphs Google, looks like July high 1700 cases 77 upvotes 7 hours ago. Hey man something big happen life good bad? testing. look total cases. wealthy muther fuckas obviously watched enough zombie movies: supplies/resources extremely limited possibly escape horde/virus reaches you.

What virus mutated carried migratory animals pass little gets passed you? limited resources possibly way getting back mainland due lack fuel boat plane. calls help may go unheard due weak signal power supplies down.

What civil unrest (as mentioned article) mainland carriers virus storm island? may armed outnumber you, so, there, take island. Universal also cheap. Username checks out. problem. I'll gladly contribute society. No, I'm really talking measles. long time ago remember measles I'm vaccinated Ok deaths? There's enough increase hospitalizations starting get concerning. probably could keep going yet gets overwhelmed easier get ahead targeted restrictions 3 worst regions.  Bob Chapek asshole. Everyone hates guy. mainly wear mask prevent others getting sick vs wear mask get sick. flu ...alway? Regardless many deaths. anything contagious even potentially contagious wear mask staying home really option.

I sort excited first started happening thinking least silver lining people going leftover masks, surely wear get sick later. see won’t case. 

My grandma died flu would %100 preventable someone wore mask even though “just silly simple cold”. stayed home honestly. 

I personally gotten embarrassment wearing mask. wear one every flu season get hit over. tried wearing one sick. didn’t like idea responsible anyones death seeing happened grandma. Sadly people would mean mug ever went. uncomfortable stopped. 

They fuck right now. cloth masks much nicer too. problem leaving house one need be. already proved actually infrastructure, clean energy , better housing etc.

NOT masks social distancing forever anti-smoking laws, thinks ok expose bystanders known cancer causing habit? 
He knows this, right? 
I ask may even recognize agree scientific fact would *maybe* better knowingly exposing people? 
Sorry shit / put good luck. harmful? challenging hour statement. feel maybe Prove It? dunno feel like found Carmen Sandiego.  much office. Physical access, screen-shotting cameras exist office too. Bad news, got home grocery store Rapid. saw state plates I90 LaCrosse local plates. holiday weekend, word gotten precautions here, swimming soup. No, low quality user. Also beyond caring, society whatever f like longer concern. I'll fine this, I'll sure hell make sure try take much money people possibly next 10 years. Thanks. Ok. Remember it’s mom, dad, brother, sister, husband/wife. “Stop overblowing this.” cares. loved one fraction people dying. 🙄 soooo don’t even matter. approve vaccine like month ago lol? Whatever happened that? I'm sure I'd googling. I've definitely heard couple different allergy stories years people odd symptoms long term exposure mild occasionally mild allergy. 


Even simple things like constant headaches stuffiness poor air quality something air, fixed plants air purifiers (more likely air purifiers I'd guess?) Meanwhile France 20k today 


Who laughing Russia?! normal day France! Yes, recession, ignore thousands dead people. Kill rich Another story England (London least.) Perhaps something leadership different. Keep safe wee bonnie scotland can, rebuild Hadrian's wall keep hordes time comes 😂 Well absolutely possible enjoy things moderation. Even not, really hurt yourself.

Every time drive without seatbelt, risk life lives everyone else car, driving road.

When smoke publicly, giving everyone around second hand smoke. outside video faked green screen.

I’m sorry, what? points time thought US strategy prevent healthcare overwhelmed. really sure ever agreed that. Hopefully spike protein good place vaccine attack. feel you. I'm struggling, mentally, job home day day even kids. really affecting coworkers children virtual school. *that’s* Carmen Sandiego been. difference Russian Boomers remember much better everything communism, Yeltsin Chicago boys pillaged country. like Putin hate American liberalism country. made weak poorer dirt. Unfortunately, alternative liberalism America’s: fascism. Communism isn’t menu anymore. ya seen people spit pandemic way im drinking one lmao Pretty effective vaccine, eh? 100mbps bidirectional 

We work OnlyFans. Stop projecting dickhead, proof worldview, clearly don't. best try explain “logic” so. 
I best allow following sounds flow one ear w/o making pit stops along way. 

Their idea “freedom” fundamentally flawed. 
What actually “selfishness.” 
They want whatever please regard impact others. 
We know wearing mask others course. 
These jerks believe wearing seat belt serve help thrown away wreck. 
How - I’d rather 150lb+ 50 mph meat bag slam behind? Wow!! Nice work. deserves post. Thanks sharing. 

Looks like 'most cases' totally red pretty soon apart Nevada guess externally influenced. Putin's vaccine work comparing covid-19 common cold? sound like Donny supporter. Yes. many packed.

Edit: probably last weekend warm weather. people throwing parties everywhere. Neighbors already setting one up. attending. risk infection trivial purposes it’s basically zero, like yes technically there’s chance it’s far 1% it’s worth talking slowing down. 
lockdowns necessary are. Maskup They're packing hospitals alright applied ""work ethic"" love League towards getting career 2 years got break never looked back

Specifically, ended going back school (MBA) made friends got career. Getting good program easy required studying, persistence, luck. Additionally, getting first hurdle go way outside comfort zone many nights self-doubt.

I also learn stop blaming others troubles. shitty, ultra-religious upbringing set behind, ultimately people care - saw was. May try drinking food? go easier. Stuff like pured soups, smoothies protein shakes. 
Chugging easier eating ""real meal"" still good nutrition. Btw, one accomplishments helping eradicate Polio Nigeria.

... setting vaccine-induced polio outbreak :) Russia communist. run small number insanely powerful oligarchs. Daily deaths approaching numbers put us national lockdown originally. know lot people say can't afford another, would surprised see full lockdown imposed within next couple weeks. Bro, didn’t offer counterpoint. You’re telling people get news someplace. understand you’re one easily brainwashed ones. need understand everybody else going simple-minded.

Please, state argument. Otherwise, take brainwashing go back window lickers. okay, dude? Maybe anger management? That's proper Czech balance. Every time Evers tried something sensible, Republican death cult done everything could stop him. hear justification ""I'm hanging young people"" time.... Like choose gets ultimately infected one passing on!?. think stops young people hung with. virus disappears, one else affected Maybe. Look India - pushing 90K cases weeks ago real bump deaths. almost like 1K month ceiling. shit that’s gone summer makes think US’s numbers accurate all? made chuckle. had, 2 weeks ago, F1 race full crowd. despite recommendation FIA this. Russia pack race track. That’s happened everywhere. even knowing this, continue happen. Silly humans! cannot understand NOTHING BAD ever happens him.

Because winner. does, wins. Difficult fall, indeed... Chocolate therapy me. 14% positivity result days ago Tokyo tested 1000 people 140 positives.

Your claim doesn’t seem match data. Guy work spent hours titty bar recently. Says ""we can't live fear"".  Lots people area whatever ”Kids” wrong term. University students Sweden (the ones talk here) 20-25+ years old. Yup, verification needed. 14,000 “health experts” wouldn’t stupid. Well kidding. older people fully aware second part trying avoid it. someone lives Japan I'm concerned sudden influx Chinese tourists might do. Numbers still way (especially Tokyo), health system still strained China exactly transparent reporting. interesting see much numbers fluctuate comes effect. voluntarily 

I see went wrong. Incredibly selfish allow stuff occur. respect. Ok, well 1.4 million dead even easier then. Peanuts. hear Joe biden wears big-ass mask. see mile away. Funny gotten sick Hmmm, infection rates going up, fatalities going down. Seems weak already succumbed. 

Time start living normal. Kids go colleges universities, adults there. Young adults adults nonetheless. That’s like average Florida day xd Good. Ive going clubbing china every week 5 months one know gotten Must nice seriously believe chinese figures? Woah that's crazy. thing happening UK - confirmed case workplace, rules everyone else carry get symptoms. What's point even testing direct long contact confirmed case/high suspicion can't get test returning work/the public? 

At least live 1/3rd number people Berlin, wide pavements forest nearby want get outside. Hardly anyone wears mask outside indoor spaces space keep distance. lots parks open spaces people gather outside find easy avoid them. lucky regard...I cycle city nature interact people go supermarket. time finish work London I'm ready deal people often bad decisions look forward quiet calm hermit life Germany 🤦‍♀️

I hope keep safe this! Epidemiology says got Trump cluster Trump himself. latter possible, even logical. Spain one worst economies Europe quite dependent tourism, good people right future Hey Bill. Really sick hearing ya man. Let’s stop giving guy platform discuss health shall we. He’s POS...with influence health one man ever have. meant say arent. That's it? Funny communist Russia behaves lot like Trump's USA! seasonal affective disorder real? Oki says 12 goes.. 


""China""

""and 11 include Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam Malaysia""


That's 8 total - Where's rest dammit article! /r agelikemilk lot European countries lying numbers. look excess deaths. Figures. Probably edgy teenager sound it. I'm sure know what's context - agency useless dangerous. Plenty serology testing showing high infection rates. CFR high due selection bias, IFR thought much lower .5%

Also good long trend data influenza. IFR pretty well known. he’s ICU tomorrow think he’ll fine. read somewhere COVID tends hit hard around day 9. day two he’s still running around I’m ok believing fended off. wear masks services add air purifiers ventilate rooms cut number infections down. 

&amp;#x200B;

but people selfish. used hate driving neighborhoods past. sometimes would literally stand middle street talking blocking traffic like owned roads tends wealthier NYC-dwellers mostly realized like cooped months end tiny apartments...plenty moved Suffolk Nassau Long Island, home prices going upwards sometimes 50k homes area selling for.  


I'm area, sister mortgages financial institution Suffolk, insane going LI home market. Agreed. It’s probably matter time. think policy retarded, boycott restaurant. “Smashed” record seems like bit much, it’s going 100 200 increment last weeks guess always sensationalized  hopeful shutdown June 2021 final one. really believe vaccine program running, reopening Broadway limited capacity june doable Could sworn vaccine putin took......

&amp;#x200B;

So take give citizens straight lied? government number official ONS using tests outside hospital settings estimate number infections. everyone symptoms even symptoms get test, estimation requirement there.

The official number confirmed cases yesterday 17540 14162 Wednesday.

The good news (if call that) testing capacity 10 times April numbers may look much higher ""first wave"" tests done. numbers may lot closer testing capacity then. live suburb. Wearing mask hassle first week two, habit. even think really big deal. Try placing bit tissue there, I've found help irritation nose. I'd comfortable visiting businesses public everyone wore masks, spending money way way hard Americans. Take HIV, universal testing, condom use needle exchanges would eradicate US (as would Treatment Prevention PrEP)... much money people ""moral"" objections. thought announced approved back August TBH curriculum year completely superfluous aside basic understanding earth's systems work...they see information unless decide pursue geology/meteorology college. need ability cite evidence, find sources reliable reputable, able defend position take, understand OK answers. 

Also, luxury making statement year go standardized testing, thus job dependent rote memorizing things. Hey now, put much thought it. article proves masks work! shit? know. I’m amazed get away, get banned, kind incivility repeatedly sub. know others haven’t gotten away much less. many already poor Corona? context? Diseases hate one cool trick. indeed. remarkable. Surely death death. people dying covid co morbidities ederly. expect survive long anyway. dont like kids, fucking dumb irresponsible country fuel anything all?

Just provide source statements get rid ""swarm fuck angry?

HAHAHaaa.. brah... *Especially* country culture people make personal sacrifices good all. Remember 200 elderly Japanese, retired engineers professionals, volunteered take crisis Fukushima power station, reasoning even radiation made ill years, still better exposing younger people much longer lives ahead them? agency sure spreaded myth masks useless. Want link? dies? 70. 70? No. Done, pandemic me. Back normal.

I went tiny bowling alley last weekend, 60 people inside, masks place gives fries ""gastronomy"". social distancing whatsoever, completely cramped. city covid hotspot. 

Good luck everybody. Wonder many asymptomatic. Yup 100%

Look two awards given too. whenever bought upvotes can’t counteract organic downvotes That’s positivity rate 1-2%. That’s well within guidelines what’s considered enough Amateurs...... India around 75k daily cases equally hard believe outbreak happens everyone 1.5B people keep month shut. Less kool aid bruh Congrats Russia, Didn’t vaccinate everyone? wouldn’t let hospital I’m still mess 6 months later crushed ways didn’t think possible I’m slowly losing everything Okay that's horrible things fixed. Dying can't be. favourite new conspiracy theory melania actually trumps handler putins girlfriend. Please share accordingly reddit. Yes. Laws tightening availability increased led this.. even try, Trump edge lord trolls everywhere. LOL I’m glad know. Please let whole world know secrets. actually know people practiced social distancing, wore mask still got COVID. Wow, ignorance really *is* bliss, huh? they’re not. Herd mentality possibility white house oh sorry hear friend.
i know, best would like said stomp flor give people fines.
every friday weekmarket live rhey patrol like ten minuets that's it. last weeks marlet saw many people without masks one tell them/get tickets. pay bahavior maybe change mind opinion. live west, 10 minuets car Remscheid. i'm really worried situation. Remscheid one first ones 50 infection last 7 days. know Single mother lives girl(4years) smal flat. kid sick couple weeks now. doctor said flu. last week kindergarden called cause covid kindergarden. little girl needs quarantine mother not. makes sense me. said kid could get tested, ten days. late asked me. really plan handle shit like consequent all...
stay save friend😷 self immolation happened virus teaching lesson humans. Western Europe tried erradicate virus summer, unfortunately that's kind impossible, learned live virus instead. no, locked down, restricted liberties, way give world lesson efficient.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Come bro joke well michigan lost mask mandate state. we'll probably start seeing sharp increase next week so. reminder potatoes arr best potatoes! Berlin 3 percent ICU capacity used covid patients numbers skyrocketing there. no, Vaccine widely available, 

By time next year, we're lucky. Well compared 100,000, 12,000 sounds better right. get caught least lied little... 
Or mistake. 
If believe Russia might well Trump! ""suspected"" probably allergy. honest, know similar allergy cold, suspect fever, cough, body aches, etc varying degrees lot quality sucked projects scrapped redone locally. Many years ago, prevailing conclusion better outsource testing documentation. However, recent years quality improving costs. causing outsourcing different countries cycle starting over. I'm college Ontario classes split. stuff online great classes including computer class health safety in-person. computer one seems like huge oversight need class use computers work time classes online computers home. help asked teacher mentioned asked in-person ""just easier"". 

With younger students though think big reason people online needing someone watch kids especially still work office. 

To combat think we'll see jump number people use babysitters. 10 year old can't stay home alone school next door neighbour high school class online might well get babysit. mixing bubbles bad 30 students per-class times however many classes going once. got locked Toronto, ottawa Toronto peel area. think Quebec already shut Montreal shows March though. last show Portland like March 15th 16th. performed symptoms? really. common co-morbidity coronavirus high blood pressure. 75 years age, three-quarters population high blood pressure. yes, people died co-morbidities. people lived also co-morbidities. Either way, time co-morbidity affects population average life expectancy much affected. 

I feel like everyone makes argument basically saying time people reach average life expectancy they're living borrowed time, wild take statistics begin with. people work lives (maybe) retire 70, then... what? fine die, less life lose? weird stance. reveal people like one replied full shit, lot western countries actually report numbers close excess death statistics tell us.

Look Germany instance, excess deaths match coronavirus deaths almost perfectly first wave (the biggest difference actually much lower numbers deaths usual country hit covid) RKI (the german CDC) honest public part using excess death statistics figure accurate numbers are.

This sub really needs take aluminium foil hats every while, clearly every country lying numbers.

Or maybe can't handle fact country fucked badly, they're projecting. Pues parece perfecto. Tonterías políticas las precisas. Si al personal hay que ponerle un bozal un par de semanas, it. Good thing vaccine  since June??? levels infection never seen Ontario, even height new cases April.. gone past numbers, 

&amp;#x200B;

change title new levels PERIOD Nice idea temporary thing, course nothing memorable going live show, things may around (stay nice hotel, special dinner out, etc.) went see Hamilton good memories trip - almost feel certain ‘vibe’ something reminds it. Would never get watching TV home. 

We looking forward seeing Dear Evan Hanson past August. great seats bought, 2 nights 5-star hotel (a total splurge) ... Covid thing real bummer :( I'm France parents got tested positive. sucks chest hurts : ( universities open like UK? Double quarter pounder cheese, large fries, large sweet tea. Two apple pies dessert maybe that's blessing then, maybe rich finally try help climate change loose island paradises. there, done three times. I'm happy Germany days. US top that, states 2k cases daily. every state 4k daily cases would much higher summed up. statistically significant difference mortality patients low oxygen though, 70% reduction. Havent seen much Empathy American lives Reddit dont know youre talkimg Yea, brain know plural can't come terms it. K shaped recovery incoming sure understand works. Thousands get covid still counting. think Sturgis could seeded countless outbreaks surrounding areas? Let's say, hypothetically, 1 person whole rally covid there. 1 person believes hoax and/or real men wear masks. party rally others feel way. bar two three virus seeded begins long period incubation. end rally, group people travel across towns areas go back home great weekend rally. believe precautions, interact normal everyone along way (i.e. gas stations, diners, dive bars, food stores, maybe parts shop two). people working visiting places seeded, cycle continues. Now, due beliefs, ignorance, selfishness original starting group, definitely going cooperate form contact tracing (because muh freedoms), therefor actual data work with. absence data, look makes sense scientific perspective based available statistics. sound like unrealistic scenario you? mind, that's least worst case scenario likely happened here. Yes automatically. part 72% concerned still think benefits person schooling outweigh risk corona, rational adult recognize corona danger. biggest issue would hurricanes.

True. adds even greater fear living island. live New York City unfortunately I'm wealthy stay. reason New Yorkers left New York living apartments cooped up. Rich people vacation homes that.

The city riddled violence homeless people. safe walk street take subway. Democrats city ruined it. many companies also decided safe employees travel city also decided move away. 

Politicians want blame coronavirus. policies putting city downward spiral now. Corona virus fast-tracked little bit. also gave scapegoat. Even worse, bars closed turn restaurant stay open. dialysis patients representative population whole?

You know not. 

What political bias, here? Discos opened month summer shut around august 15th outbreaks. smartest move open them. study schools safe, possible asymptomatic spread it? Schools cannot cause. forgetting men guns willfully licked Hitler's boots &amp; wanted good lil' nazi boys. See get guys, they're already lying hell would publish numbers high this?

If already lying, already controlling narrative much, report numbers actually make look good?

Makes sense. predicting least one million new cases day, worldwide, Christmas. live downstate Illinois virus going workplace. funny thing first person came April treated like death sentence - daily updates bosses, thoughts prayers like. We've like 50 people get since showing symptoms become boring commonplace. last one get diagnosed Wednesday even asked take computer home keep workload home.

I find interesting perception change quickly short time. exact reason it’s getting bad. Take wife. insists it. 

note: also ok ""dump"". Yes. experiment. tried shoot 6 feet away squirt gun. hit knocked over. tried cotton mask even hit th can. Since obviously ""mask police"" inspect everyone's mask idea enough people use ones good enough help reduce overall amount particles air turn help lower overall transmission rate. Yes, people wearing thin single layer fabric great job. still better nothing 10pm curfew, masks supermarkets basically replacing social distancing. name few. yes said Yeah, definitely concerned kids daycare. They're wearing masks such, deadly kids, think socializing better corona. mention working home becomes possible productive. They're still taking significant risk getting though. shitty situation parent make call though. doubtful 70% social distancing now. one every five people immune, much harder spread virus. Especially since they're probably ""out about"" people city anyway. NAD+ declines time age. Covid-19 appears dysregulate decrease it. hypothesis supplements might help. NAD+ widely available due believed anti-aging function. USA rural too, especially mid west. explain Viatnem then? Rump cringe.  people elected 2-4 years ago ones setting/approving policies directly affecting rate spread state. Ok, let tell then, 

If trying see someone virus, people likely jump bunch hoops see virus people reason think may infected. 

This controversial scientific community. also common sense. understand can't understand scientific consensus common sense. remember Covid daughter went Chicago saw Phantom. lady coughing flipping head whole thing. annoyed due noise, really caring much getting sick it. imagine coughing theater pandemic. honestly think open, require STRICT mask usage ALL, drinking eating, improved ventilation kind. Canada fewer total cases coronavirus America *deaths* ya goof. far i've enter building home since march. go work restart device. went around midnight never saw soul. still run pharmacy get medications though month. offer curbside pickup. pull call let know I'm outside pharmacist wearing PPE hands meds. 

I've stop bank times (drive thru) get tip money grocery deliveries, I've curbside pickup grocery stores slots available delivery. I've drop pick things friends (toilet paper example hard find) means leaving stuff outside doors mailboxes. managed get conversations though friend balcony half way driveway (both us still wearing masks) I've video chats texting friends. curbside voting signed ballots mailed me. basically go anywhere. plus side, last month first time since whole thing started get gas. France 20k cases today less half population Russia. bigger story ?

France also 1/5th population United States. Imagine media shitstorm US reported 100k cases day. I-Ooooh shit we’re fucked survives becomes powerful ever imagine. company, team 10, head count add approved year ended going Costa Rica, coworker quit summer also replaced someone Costa Rica. We’ve also outsourced one development team India. never said that. said evidence yet - people like need learn read properly. flat lie data back up. Prove it. dont think anyone europe thought beat. 10% really seem reasonable. Even dialysis patient study said three months ago. levels cope around world right hilarious. wife insists it, argue? makes sense. Covid ""attack"". WTF msn greece left. may better still warm sunny there. actually know bad person embrace it, completely ignorant that? definitely prefer name Rump. germany allowed wedding parties 150 guests soccer guests, stupid isn´t it? Why? Infection function population size. Thanks restore. get tested, lack trust current environment. dont trust instruments sterile receive false positive. spent working career form Healthcare, made freaking jaded paranoid. Ford too, given $1.3bil safely open schools spent $400mil. Teachers fired class sizes increased too. spent time arguing unions rather spending money. also said watching positives trend upwards past 7 WEEKS finally time something. one gives job 7 weeks keeps end. Oh ended put restrictions handful cities. Big brain move getting people go town eat go gyms. 

Also daily tweets new numbers keep emphasizing number people 40 sick ignoring they're teachers, students, essential workers casino staff. shame people partying people need go eat restaurant people need drive 20 minutes run treadmill indoors hour. can't try bad something yet are.  change fact pushing exact narrative currently disseminated Alex Berenson/Phil Kerpen crowd, thought whole thing would end hit 20% infected btw. Lots NAD+ plus products sale. Google look Amazon. Oh please please tell sarcastic. silly way think. Congrats, done it.

Per capita, would equivalent around 45,000 cases US. vaccine appears working wonderfully. earth OZ locked hard ? hospitals never came close overrun. didn’t bring refrigerated trucks like city Oh totally agree!! It’s happened 6 times school already. pisses every time. Yes every record gets broken quickly, I´m shocked see 10k cases countries less 20 million population. Fuck. Come on, USA. Step up!  That's pretty large gender difference, though. 


If expected worse, thought med would even horrible are. 

jeeze..... biggest issue would hurricanes. true part I'll give context, seems care enough hygienic good mannered, may say. I'm sad lost job I'm happy tjay deal anymore. people interact high risk severe illness? totally take risk I’d reconsider loved ones life high risk. Well, disagree. know tell you. say worry it. inconsequential life. Many things worry actually impact. But, choice fret rant. discussion boards for. Unemployment figures quite good considering recession, small businesses get wiped time, come back pretty quickly, mental health going improved killing people.
 
Pull head in. Dr. Fauci called masking small animals, saying trees need separated six feet. summer another 2 months. cases driven throughout winter, peak occurring 30th July.
 
You can't blame weather. Look, I’m minimizing it. 6x flu lot deaths. you’re trying make people take seriously current tactic won’t work. like Reefer Madness. Telling exaggerated lies make something seem much scarier makes people trust anything else say. 

6x avg flu bad, bad worse pandemic flu 1968 1957. makes worst infectious disease outbreak since 1918 (not counting HIV). reason make preposterous claims like flu kills 2k people, Covid kills 100x flu One light on. know madly tweeting. like Arizona leading edge Covid-19 containment. among worst nation while, governor douchebag saw that. ALLOWED cities pass mask mandates shut gyms bars.. restaurants things got better. reason cases dropped fast allowed run rampant start. Agreed! much going it! Plus haven’t fact checked said don’t think highest taxes true, . There’s lot Az bad. mean still meet friends it’s we’re really safe it. know many others age act like complete dumbasses though Today hit new daily record deaths (485) positivity rate (58%). I've seen, models show 100k day. cases slowly fading months Buenos Aires Province Buenos Aires City (⅓ population), cases deaths rest country spiking like crazy, healthcare system poor limited. better talk testing there. 

 Many belive Buenos Aires City far away herd inmunity (200k cases 35% positivity rate 3M inhabitants).

But honest, people worried upcoming crisis. Situation bad already, coronavirus (bias alert here) goverment everything destroy middle class spend (and printing) money have, future seems dark (end bias). mean, economic crisis matter WHEN. Good catch! first real country hit mark. 

Only San Marino 0.12% 

Belgium chasing 0.087%. boss uses phrase lot days. Ducey met Pence today. Fucking asshole super spreader.

On plus side, he's friends asshole old boss nothing fuck anyone ever worked him. wanted know can't say word bankruptcy expect anything happen. Trump specifically requested Regeneron stake company. something anyone, even president, would given standard treatment.  needs go get new human skin. ones wearing Someone mentioned term ""prosperity gospel"" talking this, think explains lot behaviour. There's Puritan-influenced idea wealthy successful people rewarded virtue, maybe favored God; hand bad things happen someone considered sign morally worthy. 

This kind thinking seems entrenched American values, think lot people subscribe level. course everyone thinks they're good person they'll think place among successful logic. figure also lot people care protections getting sick; think they're morally good misfortune would never strike them. fargin way travel. sharing time via webex microsoft teams Blame governor! hate administration doing. honestly hope coronavirus serious damage trump. even kill want suffer. would argue moral position society fluid cyclical. return upstanding position definitely possible future. 

During Gilded Age, robber barons ran society amok. Inequality time high people didn’t trust media. Later, stumbled again: President Harding cabinet basically bunch crooks. Extremely effective making sure hospitals overrun transmission rate lower.

That's fine! can't go like this. Keep certain things closed, wear masks, ect. world needs start way people going worse shit storm would caught covid 99+% chance living. Yes. exact worse time! Spread virus exponential. could helped didn’t lie us! know shouldn’t believe everything read online hope story isn’t true. That’s unbelievably rude trashy. somehow genuinely believe US fully locked 4 weeks virus would eliminated. pure fantady friend. eliminating virus. can't keep quoting they're independent impartial scientific body, time concede mercy decisions coming Beijing.

Being independent authority China two separate things book. However, that's define independence, guess independent country, organization person outside example, pressure China lead delay confirming person-to-person transmission, declaring pandemic?

Or, said themselves, simply reported Chinese health officials told them. think important us know what, any, effect politics early missteps.

And whatever power China WHO, US it, China's influence grown.  Coincidence? Yes. Masks useless.

(/s, obviously) ...?

Hahaha triggered. fucking shit! Interesting, follow case counts deaths, always seems it’s right around 3%. Like what?! disagree principle. said I'd take eternal social distancing. honest eternal social distancing worst thing imaginable. Sad CDC trying hard explained incorrect recommendations. know n95 would work, know cloth mask mandates increase deaths. said January trump needs suspend CDC FDA. everything made covid much deadly. admit tested negative, i'm better several days symptoms got severe much quickly treatment got desperate much quickly one would expect Thursday diagnosis daily negatives every previous day. Nerd alert Wow you’re cool false. Cases dropped state already got virus since people asymptomatic, got get again, cases obviously drop.

But yeah, cotton masks polyester gators savior. really. sniffles, barely smell anything that’s really rare. proper Covid test definitely useful, otherwise everybody cold tests positive... So...what exactly...about science masks existed decades...has changed?

Was also mitigating run masks stated could harm good? one last 7 months. Blocked asswipe. we're one worst world undeniable. We're going crush lying fucks less month. Captain Covid Cuomo would say... It’s hard say since seem sort ebbs flows outbreaks, followed stricter regulations (unless you’re Florida) would take awhile reach true herd immunity, people infected, less people hosts spread virus. exact science, even let run rampant, believe would vaccine everyone infected. Well close one, let guard virus think mean antigen. translation error. Chinese pooled PCR. CCDC says antigen tests sufficiently reliable. realize recommendations science change yeah? That’s literally science works.

So science masks changed last 7 months? *exactly* science masks changed?

Yeah...Fauci says lied mask recommendation PPE shortages. lied. He's liar. People wear masks...and apparently people died it...so one blaming 1000s 1000s deaths? finger always pointed Trump? Trump claims sold danger virus avoid panic people crucify him...but Fauci allegedly lies avoid run masks one says word?

Do see disconnect?


It's one thing say masks necessary avoid run them...but state wearing could harm good mitigating shortage. far likely truth. That's kind statement stick people long mitigation efforts done. part mitigation effort deeply irresponsible held account...which NEVER see happen. may true, still get happened week changed everything. stocks I've flat since May suddenly spiked 5-9% week, nowhere. news, nothing. likely 2 weeks since contracted virus

We even hit severe part going hit signs everywhere building wear mask common areas. front office keeps sending email blasts reminding us wear masks nobody except two older ladies. outside see anyone else. grandmother surgery go anywhere 2 weeks make sure catch anything. different. US Europe doctors reporters go directly media without going jail. US specifically, state report numbers, we've actually seen major news organizations questioning validity CDC numbers. saying numbers wrong, healthy debate needed make sure organizations skewing reporting guidelines favor one political party. Sure. I'm saying evidence Wednesday diagnosis. It’s also physically possible many places.

I live Switzerland trains buses crowded, don’t rolling stock reduce that, either start another lockdown (which lot people ignore) ccc distancing possible here. 

In US everybody car outside big cities, would easier. Sorry, meant 50%, 100%, know got mixed up.

Death growing 50 % compared day prior dosen't mean cumulative death rising way. 

Either way, fail se Sweden could stopped deaths general mid march. Considering long takes people die covid, Sweden far gone. Obviously countries, spain, worse spread, Swedens spread fast. Look numbers march early april. 

Of course Sweden could perhaps stopped spread somewhat. yet seen credible evidence making big difference. That’s weird.. almost science right Georgian here. No, aren't. Also, numbers going down, people think good number well. 

It worse month ago everyone living like nothing happening. exhausting live see blatant disregard. parts Atlanta take seriously Mayor Bottoms. Outside Atlanta mask wearing less common COVID deniers rampant. 

Us Georgians okay. nice birthday party, many guests, indoors, wearing masks.

This case god getting them, put it. God gave brain. chose use it. blame god, one them. Poppers use used deodorizers. Europe losing well. back office since June gotta say bad. Wear mask, wash hands, keep safe distance everyone, use Microsoft Teams every chance get. Oh, poor woman. many one family. Fauci told us wear mask. go trial murders! sad would obvious sarcasm days. That's screwed USA is. What.a.shit.show. matter time till cases go back AZ. Scottsdale believe Sierra Vista lifted mask mandate. already getting lax flu season hasn’t even hit. believe Maricopa talking possibly lifting mask mandate well. matter time....

I know cause live Arizona 😱😱 mean, would took out. Dudes dangerous. really think mortality rate better India?

You're bright. Stand front house proudly. Rip mask. Say fought virus walk inside people share joy. /s Give another 3 weeks. virus known making people little bit sick, get better ... couple weeks later hits full force. sarcastic lol. guess it’s hard tell writing, included emoji. idk could take test prove he's negative Damn it, like original Blade Runner movie, it? pets left - high-tech imitations. :( Unfortunately he’s evil smart opposed trump evil stupid. 10 day doubling would hold consistent awareness rose right? precautions put place doubling would occurred much quicker? post politicalcompassmemes telling someone educate nuances politics one notice days hit number repeatedly? He’ll still celebrate 30th appearance Time’s cover. Indiana here. stage 5. requirements masks health department approval gatherings 500 people. Everything else back normal. cases shooting up, course. Trim fat baby. Trim fat. ""Well congratulations, wasted tax dollars. what's next step master plan?""

""Crashing country ... survivors!""  Depends count... itching declared safe debate person, could say Thursday counts day 1 Saturday day 10. 240hrs Trump stickler details. Correction.. Dictators Newsom cumo etc put around 100 million people extreme poverty. dictators this. SOP patients tested negative twice least 24hrs apart. Obviously he'll already tweeting aboyt it. Hell yah. worked pretty well Canada. Let’s put 65000 people stadium” anyone noticed ""mistakes"" resulted missed cases overcounted cases? knew !east two people unable get heart medicine early pandemic. Neither likely due immediately, probably ramifications weeks missing meds. 

she'd probably like know 'monoclonal' 1.1 million deaths right number. don’t believe gave estimate number deaths. Many countries don’t ability track Covid deaths. Accurate welcome.  silly, libs power looks insane photo. know technicians theaters then, thought capaable setting simple console, OBS scenes.

I'm even field I'd capable that.

Adjust survive, struggle guess. exponential growth won’t people get sick quicker? Honest question 2026 exponential growth? it’s worth Scottsdale lot everywhere I’ve encountered still 95% masked Imagine that; Senate Majority Leader knows Trump plague rat. I’ve said multiple times. People big egos social media. care elaborate going continue misspell words purpose think funny. image says everything 2020. Especially wear masks. said culture?  Hes probably loser aware sort pandemic prevention measures China put place? EU far behind

The eu looking another round lockdowns. It's... almost Covid real scientific medical measures actually work!  give regeneron. cure. No, not. everyone sheltered place 4 weeks would go pretty much 

Do understand whole thing began SINGLE infection???

""pretty much"" bumps timeline back months, would spread 4 weeks end exact situation. live hour morning senior grocery stores open general public. willing use it. Prepare downvotes, Reddit seems hate Greek life. got downvoted hell defending another thread.  Money power. dude talking probably one qualified scientists field . look risk virus design precautions around . Arizona didn’t ask Trump’s permission mask mandate. states need stepping wear long think best expect others same.  Yes... everyone knows bridge party. banalised situation point people stopped believing pandemic. many people say it’s hoax it’s little cold (“chripecka”) kind situations add problem. problem largely mental one... Wow, that’s absolutely insane. feel people side country growing tired restrictions? makes sense holding everyone hostage literally data.

Care share 'data' class? Sororities literally can’t parties. Men aren’t even allowed sorority housing. shows little know Greek life. Decadron, dexamethasone, actually one glucocorticoids hardly affinity mineralocorticoid receptor. actually expect initial reduction mineralocorticoid receptor activation, suppression HPA-axis dex leads reduced production cortisol corticosterone, activate MR. 

Water retention may occur (e.g. increasing glucose levels blood, classical glucocorticoid receptor effect, increase thirst fluid intake) swelling limbs side-effect dexamethasone, mineralocorticoid effects (which would indeed systemic, MR controls system water retention water reabsorption kidney). wait thought free americans ? Ummm probably lol Vaccines lead better immune response disease though PHD molecular biology certainly qualified worked several vaccines before. health minister Australia literally mispoke today said 'adapt new world order'

But i'm nutjob? know someone obese roughly age Trump. caught virus recovered 4 5 days drugs.

My uncle complete left side paralysis stroke. asymptomatic. knew tested nursing home room mate died Covid. 

Just risk factors mean going die even get severely ill.

Your political bias gross imply fake unhappy get ill. Basically bad Trump's political bias. Fake news right? work Cinemark CA. Last Friday opened, 600 people came within eight hours. usual numbers still good. people want risk getting sick virus available vaccine. stop acting stupid like understand this. stressed mad irl mean everyone subreddit reports news COVID lazy bum. Sort issues man, put blame people fuck ups. Hey now! thank Koch brothers court. Make mistake, best supreme court money buy. need get high horse People's Republic Illinois put former Governors prison. Even blind squirrel finds nut while. literally look numbers balance safety freedom.

I'm curious metric use compare things... much safety 1 freedom worth? Would cost taxpayers less too. Ok let's unpack this:

His doctors said tested found lot antibodies. maker Regeneron said likely due antibodies given, they've seen patients. producing antibodies came hospital, impetus treatment, body likely either.

He doctors sign NDAs he's protected HIPAA. allowed divulge information without permission president say wants.

Hes currently Dex, article posted yesterday kinds stories people it, serious, life threatening conditions, felt beyond amazing. acted exactly like Trump acting now, completely confident fine.

The Dex reduces lung tissue inflammation stops mechanism causes basically like massive allergic reaction COVID patients. stopping cytokine storm lung inflammation typically causes death. also trashes patient's immune system, since Trump creating antibodies, he's taken Dex, happens? entirely sure, since he's able fight infection, possible bad shit happens.

His videos: guy looks like cadaver, right side drooping. voice hoarse, times obviously breath, he's completely rocker (even usual, another side effect Dex, may cause taken safe; becomes psychotic).

Given this, cut dry assured he's ok ok. Commendable recommendation. Truly. One problem.  


If save yourself, will? proper question, ultimately expected save yourself, is? taxpayer? Okay sure one work, long everyone work. least income taxed. Ultimately doctor needs paid someone right? paying. Ultimately, comes back again.  


Now get wrong, combined efforts make better society everyone. often people saying said actually still really thinking best loved ones. Unless truly selfless, case mind giving well betterment others, right? 


This society runs entitlement self preservation ultimately. never change somehow change human nature itself.  


Good luck. I’ll reiterate trump meet criteria Expanded Access/Compassionate use. drug simply administered program it’s medication last resort - it’s instead studied patients early stage covid pneumonia. 

Check expanded access program criteria FDAs website info. Trump doesn’t meet first criterion. want participate vaccine trials (which 100% choice) suggest vaccines made work better them? Trumps loser followers even dumber believing him. Followers = conservatives guess there’s good reason it’s called ‘us’ clear, lower risk thing immune. No, not. ***everyone*** sheltered place 4 weeks would go pretty much away. 

Everyone. 

Not people, majority, everyone. 

I interested ""what ifs"" enforcement adherence. saying everyone sheltered place 4 weeks virus would almost completely disappear. 

I care people stupid, care people listen. I'm saying ""if tried people listen still broke quarantine would work"", that's absurd. I'm discussing possible means enforcement anything else trying ""gotcha"" with. 

If completely wrong, please explain virus typically lasts 4 weeks survive great number everyone shelters place 4 weeks. 

Do say ""but people it."" That's discussing. discussing scenario people actually it. WH blocking cdc contact tracing fear Trump patient zero? anyway, Trump brought general infection WH, gotta go real place needs disinfected. worst part Utah LDS area presidency made statement months ago masks women's organization church coordinated sewing/donating millions masks top leaders church wearing masks weekend semi-annual conference willfully ignorance members church point. murder mind victim's corpse autopsied studied advance Forensics Pathology

You may find reading Henrietta Lacks interesting. believe Immortal Life Henrietta Lacks good overview. discusses lot ethical issues, whether scientific progress trump personal agency Funny, rest world figured fail miserably inevitable pandemic. Getting pissed source something inevitable prepared handle pathetic. think so, scientists Latin America ignorant, well paid first-world counterparts similar equipment, training, certainly internet access, Chile close first-world anyway, bunch issues USA. would notice D164G mutation that's everywhere. Bet dollars dog turds ain't getting miracle drugs. feel like nobody wears downtown. Even recover, could life long affects it. would take vote DC majority vote House Senate. Maryland Virginia say matter. upper class 👀 problem! many people stubborn wear masks. Plus leader also went it. think really cares ones died. sure got special treatment got sick it. There's evidence 80-90% anyone knows of. 

Unless independent research team case posting reddit. lot Trump done disgraceful, including locking secret service car ill covid, didn’t result that. assumed did, guy covid late september there’s much greater chance gave trump vice verca.  Someday tell Titans. Looking excess deaths (NYT analysis: it‘s much worse reported. Easily twice official count, likely even three times. would 1 330 died due pandemic. don’t even want know translates people 60+. Peru worst-hit country terms deaths per capita adjusting excess mortality data. Basically morons assholes dumb realize stupid wrong side history.  masked said event? close prolonged contact others? work policies this? would still valid multipliers would 0.x seem eager jump throats everyone thread ***actively admitted wrong?***

They chose say ""hey, wrong, know better."" something worth attacking? 

That's ideal behavior find wrong something, accept adapt. attack people bettering themselves. VOTE!!! main experience comes traveling Taiwan hundreds people know there. I've Taiwan around 20 times worked company based TW many years.

It definitely something people remember blip. SARS way deadlier covid-19, even though total deaths much lower, people much afraid contract it. 

The ubiquity mask wearing followed outbreak SARS. Taiwan people wear masks indoors pollution. entirely normal prior covid-19 see multiple people office wearing masks.

So, know trying convince lived experience wrong, encourage others skeptical people call things like hearing ""narrative."" 0 new domestic cases seem realistic....I mean New Zealand sure, small population, isolated...but China 0 domestic cases? mean maybe I'm wrong seems suspicious. I'm curious something. ,5 years back, knew someone worked ICU.
The icu 15 beds 
And least 5 separated pull away curtain. covid/non covid patient separated? they? Lol like 20 million people. chill live normal life without rona vaccine ready. It’s lower risk don’t think it’s zero risk, parents high risk concerned abundance caution? know least one study found aerosols exhaled breathing talking remain infectious 16 hours. would partly explain spreads easily. Yes, covid19 first time mass pcr testing used like this. would also presume obesity population Midwest would also something it?

Edit: alternatively instead presuming, could read article mentions overweight, focused coronary artery disease age biggest factor. Interesting! Sweden reacted correctly. Everyone else overreacted.  actual source? saw news articles elevator button trash unclear result finding virus surfaces assumption based contact tracing. didn’t exist before. guy runs Warp Speed committee. pulled Merrick Garland packing lower courts bunch unqualified dipshits. FUCK THEM. Obama tried nice saw got him. not, lower standards.

But note, I'd take part trial right could, course I'd take approved vaccine. Sure I'm saying shouldn't. I'm saying, Democrat charge would shove Republican's throat get two new Democratic Senators floor could continue shove shit throats, Republicans shown that's play. It’s really quite simple quite logical. Mask compliance reduces necessity length lockdowns. 

It boggles mind one anti-mask anti-lockdown, able grasp epic failure reasoning. 

It’s kind flawed reasoning brought us witch trials 400 years ago. scientific method enlightenment.

Please like share. Boy vaccine sure working! outfits fire tho. Masks less mandated Korea (I'm totally certain lol), first. people city Daegu (one world's earliest epicenters back February, Shinchenji shit happend) voluntarily wore masks voluntarily locked down. city never official lockdown. cases went short while.

To day honestly wonder exactly made striking difference behaviors western countries us. Government vigilant right thing one thing, people behaving responsibly whole another. People theories (cultural difference, scientific literacy, generally trust government policies, etc.) strong answer. also tool used want manipulate thousands years. I'm preach, challenge. OK throwing everything away living fear something incredibly high survivability rate, that's right. last week, state 0.150% rate active infection. think living fear 15/100ths 1% worth it, surrender freedoms bow down. not. ifr 5 times flu

You're comparing incomparable things - total infection fatality rate vs case (diagnosed infection) fatality rate. study looks antibodies, whereas estimates flu death rate ~0.1% based known (symptomatic) infections.

The swine flu pandemic 2009 estimated death rate around 0.02% (12,400 deaths 61 million infections), would mean particular study estimates covid19 25 times severe swine flu, therefore likely 25 times severe average seasonal flu. Apologies dumb question, keep reading articles expected timeline vaccine keep saying vaccine approved late october early november, could 100 million at-risk people vaccinated january. widespread vaccination? 100 million like 1/3 US population that’s assuming 300 million even want take better protection compared N95 then? could seen happening?!!? instant white house took reporting numbers CDC stats improved dramatically! everything great! great country! U U Reddit enjoys crisis. Especially ""unpopular"" politicians (Trump, Boris etc) helm. focus worst possible interpretation everything.

The politicians LOVING power. Shutting stuff down. I'll honest, authoritarian type people (Karens, redditors etc) also loving - telling wear, act, telling go allowed see.

The media loving too. eyes glued TV, social media etc.

The goalpost moving INSANE. Back Feb-Mar talking flattening curve prevent hospitals overflowing. ended hospitals super empty, hundreds thousands cancelled appointments, missed cancer screenings etc. backlog going cost lives years. leave mistake put “Edit: actually here’s learned wrong” helpful burying mistake thread 50% less people see it.

Or something similar probably. mean obviously spy-level security. supposed keep away Otta ""i gotta need vacation trip"" Normalbürger. think countries fine whatever.  Specifically, New Glarus. ;) umm yeah. one forcing go church. Surely must loads people Republican Party White House think he’s fucking idiot? Woah! almost science right something! mother says something similar. knows trucker travels across several states says nobody really COVID aware you’re also dealing organized groups wants country recover well economically. redditor perhaps someone that’s whispering ear (astroturfing) Well done. blend collectivism liberty believe future humans. Moving family Syndney got far enticing!! must Newsom making allowing casinos theme parks skirt restriction limiting gatherings start outbreak. Utah still one lowest death rates country. People right thing, do. Isolate worried, stop asking mommy government fix everything you.... need go school want. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lmao nobody wants say Vietnam example country isolated well. Would take Regeneron given EUA? Cheers! Wow. 20% false negative. Thats pretty high. 
Could happened sister tested already recovery? feel fatigue week first hard breathe symptom occured. 
But many covid symptoms like myalgia, fever (around 39 C. although day) fever day???, fatigue, feeling tightness like something pressing chest. Wow. covid confusing

Well types pneumonia. I’m sure it. leukocyte level never high, mild cough, 1 day fever. Hopefully vaccine soon possible Bad vibes. think ""arrogance"" that's killing America.  muh freedum, me, me, me, ""I'm doctor virus can't touch cuz it'll never happen me"". level arrogance coupled ignorance narcissistic behavior lethal combo bring country down. r/noshitsherlock mean would scared - would good news... instant herd immunity  Quid pro que running country like family business.

Was surprised republicans sing praises families joined White House.

"" see! action bigger words, takes care family. He's good man!"" Free asbestos too!  record, agree Japan’s decision keep us really wouldn’t put falsifying statistics past government problem mass murdering protestors. think China great leadership. basically anything though. basically everything still open, people still fly crowded airplanes anyone batting eye, masks weren’t even anyone’s radar good bad thing. Well it’s certainly possible contracted Disney World, certainly didn’t sort contact tracing efforts going, honestly knows particular case contracted. Also, you’re familiar proposed, travel would significant factor since would live within 120 miles park order admitted it. wouldn’t people flying across country, even within state attend parks. acknowledge, think travel something problematic, given proposed, actually think travel restriction reasonable. wassup yall think may coronavirus, wanted ask anyone experienced eye pain all. look side eye feel strained ig. sure anyone else corona

probably gonna get tested next week Less 100 cases per day korea true. China untrustworthy anything affect personally

Did really ask spreading possibly fatal disease affects people personally? 

Medical personnel full PPE gear getting dying. think face shield going protect danger present? Per worldometers CDC, Texas passed California total number COVID-19 deaths, behind New York (city state whole). Yup, time open bars.

However, Texas way behind Florida per capita deaths. Florida streak that, per worldometers, pushed Maryland Pennsylvania nationwide average, may Delaware tomorrow weekend. Finland population WI, 267 cases yesterday next week probably see high schools close gathering limits go low enough make indoor gatherings impractical. person elected world leader barely follow simple fucking health codes, hell think trust people elected couldn’t? Maybe beat record ""longest safe cruise journey new cases"". standing record sailing 12 minutes 43 seconds someone got infected. Florida people don’t go New Orleans... PLEASE!!! honestly care citizens, don’t even give crap food them. testing people (at least one) getting covid dying traveling LA Disney World agree you, point going ignored downvoted everyone doesn’t fit “hive mind”

I’m anti-mask, people need open eyes sometimes. Wow. That’s fucked up. actually misleading read past headlines, even example NOS says so. Maybe start 1% first two people never got fever would never known Covid without test...they would thought allergies common cold.

What symptoms two fever? bet fixating one sentence said early pandemic

That corroborated repeated CDC. Framing one sentence one (""just Dr"") guy rather disingenuous.

According CDC average 240,000 people die every month US. Judging numbers (admittedly incomplete) 2020 looking much worse year...and none excess numbers (assuming exist) attributed mitigation efforts even tho know efforts causing deaths across nation/world.

It's curious looked lack emotion. WH might well patient 0 staff coming going want that. Trump's negligence responsible 210.000 deaths, case there's active behaviour endangerment patient 0 could factually actively responsible man's health. ☹️ understand you’re saying, life shouldn’t way. hope get enjoy life! Fellow Sydney dweller...well think motivation quite obvious..we looked windows...saw damn kiwis standing saying anything ;) Dakota set records Thursday active cases, hospitalizations new deaths, 14. small hospital serves Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe transferred two virus patients state administrators 14 facilities said diverting contradicted assurances Gov. Kristi Noem, Republican whose plan combating virus focused increasing treatment capacity rather preventing infection. Noem, insisted since spring spread disease inevitable, come growing height arrogance ignorance claim inaction badge honor,” state Democratic Party chairman Randy Seiler said.

Uh oh, Kristi ~~Noem~~ DeSantis! Better call Republican pals get crash course field morgues. Asshole. MaSkS dOeSn’T wOrK

– Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist Sweden strict lockdown, still severe restrictions. sure you’ve heard, live something called society, rely one another right thing responsible. policy local governments make policies regarding CoVID

Same Florida. Local governments can't mandate anything police told enforce anything. First place I've seen it, fuck arizona.  spirit, dugernaut, spirit. hospital work won’t allow without mask. I’m gobsmacked hospital allows option wear mask. Look, whether parks open isn’t ultimately power, say inconsequential. said, think Newsom owes state explanation either going get parks open people support pandemic assistance runs put forth plan order help support amusement parks reopen. point, Newsom pretty opaque think parks, Disney not, legitimate grievances way governor handled whole process. stands, still don’t Fishel metrics guidelines would allow parks re-open, doesn’t seem like governor anyone state talking theme parks aside theme parks shouting void hoping someone thing. extremely multifaceted issue simply parks themselves, secondary tertiary interactions come parks operations. Whether like companies parks themselves, can’t denied major part economy cultures Southern California particular. governor owes California residents know what’s going happen parks also what’s going happen employees, cities, businesses rely economic well-being.

For me, governor Newsom needs deal decisively simply putting has. think let linger much, he’s going draw continued skepticism reopening amusement parks, upon whole four tier reopening plan set up. peoples contention decisions re-opening safety, plan already failed test. point, frustrated anyone federal response forced us bad situation choosing putting multiple fires given time. right triage manage situation we’ve given. Hopefully change soon, meantime deal hand dealt. 

For me, feel like I’ve laid least reasonable critique main attitudes assumptions exist Reddit, I’m happy engage dialogue Here. I’m happy talk anything I’ve said here, hope anyone responding also kind enough realize greatly summarize complicated thoughts feelings topic everything said generally incomplete, though also generally representative general position. don’t think I’ve laid isn’t without flaws need tweaking Justments, also don’t think I’m saying unreasonable “denying science” accuse doing. I’m willing knowledge tough issue, completely understand folks may feel way keeping parks closed. said, don’t think anyone good make dichotomy folks want keep parks closed good guys anyone wants open bad guys. nuance ought applied. Anyone thinks hospitals aren’t constantly full even prior years never tried get bed hospital before. Jesus takes wheel steers right cliff. Must God's will, oh well *it is.* I'm sorry loss :( April isn’t far away thing fuckin everywhere. Sigh. know popular issue circle jerk on, would hope people actually dialogue here. completely understand intuition theme parks danger remain closed, think need look completely accepting assumption fact.

Every time subject comes up, ask Clear evidence ties amusement parks back major spreading events. Even don’t trust numbers coming Florida states US, far I’m aware, internationally outbreaks linked parks. might also argue hard compare countries lower rates infection. given many, many parks around world, would figure least one would’ve outbreak associated park. yet, evidence knowledge. 

To me, key thing actually look kind behaviors going within park itself. me, things particularly benefit amusement parks general, certainly California, something primarily outside, controlled boundaries park operators know comes out. Also, particularly case Disney, actually quite strict enforcement social distancing mask wearing, certainly compared typical grocery store retail outlet. Given actually know virus spreads, willing look activities go measures business might proposing order allow re-open extent. me, one keys really irks me, actually take idea it’s data, science, evidence, willing update views acceptable learn new information virus it’s self. me, Feeling bad plandemic anti-maskers claim.

Let’s also consider fact amusement parks already run events grounds would essentially call “open“ extent. particular, Knottsberry farm Seaworld run food events use parks grounds purposes. hypothetical situation capacity events remain consistent system rides allowed reopen, essential difference here? matter rides allowed run people allowed attend food event? long capacity limited, difference? maybe say yourself, well wouldn’t worth parks, maybe that’s true. think state let make decision put ball court.

In addition already allowed parks, think need take critical look what’s actually allowed operate. example, zoos aquariums always similar grouping me, mentally, amusement parks. you’re aware, San Diego zoo currently allowed open, go website, state ready 1 2 hour wait simply get zoo peak hours. course difference San Diego zoo Disneyland functional perspective? consider places go carts mini golf allowed resume operations. Indoor movie theaters many places re-open extent. many forms personal entertainment recreation open extent while. Even bars resume outdoor operations orange tier indoor dining even allowed early red tier remember correctly. don’t necessarily want advocate closing businesses already reopened, think needs consistency think it’s hard make case that, given appropriate precautions, things less risk walking around amusement park, outdoors, mask on.

And may say these, “well people don’t travel around country go places,” something would correct stating. However, guidelines leaked, proposed 120 mile limit guest planning enter park. rule irked folks, actually think it’s quite Reasonable. think travel legitimate concern, think reasonable place start. many problems people bring up, don’t necessarily think challenges face insurmountable, require creative thinking willingness assess appropriate.

Perhaps one important considerations keeping parks closed hurting park operators, it’s also hurting employees, cities, surrounding businesses. I’ve heard many people make argument “going Disneyland essential, possibly arguing this?“ would agree it’s essential people visiting, essential quite number people derive ability live support families based operations parks. matter think Disney parks companies, punishing staying closed going end hurting employees. would agree Disney kind shitty company need real reforms talked about, end day, we’re preventing thousands people able stay current employment arrangements. 

Probably worse situation cities businesses rely parks. example, cities surrounding parks, particularly orange county, facing massive budget shortfalls (like hundreds millions dollars) typically count taxes revenue linked tourism park operations. Without assurance ability plan future, may lay people work cities also reduce certain civic functions like public safety basic government functions. unfortunately, moment, there’s nothing really do. far I’m aware, governor hasn’t put forth kind plan help cities people live them. supposed here?

In providing criticism, always find it’s important also provide potential solutions. me, think probably reasonable compromise would tiered re-opening plan amusement parks themselves. purple tear, concessions operate; red tier, outdoor attractions may resume; orange tier indoor attractions may resume limited capacity, yellow tier; capacity somewhat increased park itself. aware leaked guidelines were, don’t disagree anything list, except requirement parks counties yellow tier order begin operations (where cases county 1 per 100,000). bring extreme uncertainty businesses, brings hell lot uncertainty employees, Cities, businesses rely park operations. Given don’t think consistently yellow tier basically pandemic over, think unrealistic, think it’s also regulation put good faith. certainly don’t think propose go place finally, it’s something starting point actual discussions negotiations.

(Continued due length) isn’t new information. We’ve known cats dogs dying COVID since February. don’t understand people hearing now. cat caught it, hundreds who’s dogs cats died caught would find? 8 top 10 states deaths per capita blue. debatable unknowable point exactly outcome vaccine regards much safety gain (both efficacy vaccine well reduction general spread), really point anyway. point hand peoples' behavior going be. Peoples' behavior always well grounded facts science, I'm sure /u/713_ToThe_832 probably correct; people going completely done time there's widely available vaccine. even going matter vaccine 50% effective covid still major problem. They'll done anyway.

I believe jargon idea whether pandemic end ""medically"" ""socially"". ends medically, means beat virus vaccines treatments. ends socially, population large simply decided done it. think point people, including experts, believe thing going end socially ends medically, regardless smart may may be. feel this. RIP hundreds thousands Americans. saw coming anything. believe right. guess everyone :) I’m US I’ve lived worked healthcare US years care admit. I’m well aware costs. reason costs much healthcare largely profit system. shouldn’t be.

But test development separate issue. tests developed USA. Much principles behind testing improvement pre-existing methodology. keep ""bad bot""-ing automods. Maybe get rid awful bot someday. Kamala Harris tweeted administration halting fracking operations, one hottest years recorded history. that's DEMOCRATS.

Science runs entirely counter culture US whole. R vs matter, whole country sold bulk corporations, children live scraps. There’s also old Nazi/American complex time Hollywood hills somewhere. lots Nazis west coast went war. Netherlands people infected much younger, spend much time hospitals less likely die corona.

95% infected people still health issues six months. Lol,, many votes, sure PRC slaves working hard. Ugh. buying merchandise directly artists giving MusiCares, admit never even thought specialized event folks. country enough money could paid stay home this. would easy read entire entertainment industry along bars restaurants could bailed year small slice allocated last COVID bill. hope get another one done soon helps. heartbreaking unnecessary. Germanophone, typo germophobe? god we're living worst timeline article 76 symptoms, 86 covid symptoms. Also got tested doesnt say never got symptoms. Also also sample 115 people huge study Well largest population Europe so... yeah? use NPI starve virus like PRC VN tech legal requirements TTI close baseline like RoK did. ‘pay loss’, mean would simply going debt pay eventually, rather actually free rent? correct... = death, 25-30 least hospital. Skift based NYC Could provide information claim, link data proves this? Utah seen 66 child hospitalisations since beginning pandemic, mortality rate per hospitalisation States would suggest one two deaths most: important take pandemic measures limit disease spread seriously, equally important create additional fear panic misrepresenting seriousness situation claiming people - particularly children - dying actually case. Many parents terrified children's health safety comments help this, particularly figures exaggerated. comment reported misinformation, unless provide proof hospital friend works seen 'several' children die it, uphold reports misinformation available data support claim. article OP linked comments says 86% covid symptoms tested 76 symptoms all.

Also say developed later date test. know couple people tested positive getting test friend/family member symptoms tested positive got symptoms test develop after. Yeah definitely attack US ICBMs backfire /s found Bob Iger's account! Seriously?

Test 100000 people. positive. 86000 people - symptoms. head NHS England says hundreds thousands people could suffering effects what's know long Covid. Spitballing..... But...

86% people little nothing worry about? Counties different levels though, think people traveling across many different Cali counties congregate parks, coupled fact likely main demographic people would visit amusement park amidst pandemic likely people take virus seriously, seems like setup spread virus among counties, visitors travel back communities. 

I agree consistency though. told protests ok virus low chance transmission outdoor setting masks, reason outdoor theme parks allowed operate, especially limited capacity. 

I think Newsom's handling poor confusing. I'm nurse, work nonprofits. But, got degree, complications, ended three separate cohorts, one year. got know three years graduating classes social workers. common type person getting degree woman grew well off, christian, believed family god statistics, helping people important. thought helping people important made better people. people helping truly needed deserved it. worked 5 nonprofits. something come across often, large part people burn job two years.

I think nursing incentive social work does. lot people go think they're supposed good person. care studies actual needs people they're helping.

I'm saying insult nurses social workers, anyone else.

But prevalent problem. say “duh” conservative? Yeah, pinkeye issue aside, think possible chain 1 2 persons Trump's infection could still Pence orbit possible even asymptomatic infected Pence.

Regardless, bet anything positive ""felt fine"" lied full looney-toons Scott Atlas levels denial virus. Like, Atlas' world going get it, 80-90% us, anyway. So, might well get early get magic sweet herd immunity earlier instead later. think probably believe that.

Enough time passed Pence serious symptoms, though, maybe now.

Trump well. videos another lame quick one greenscreen time. phone calls Fox shows bad. He's coughing, manic seems like continues struggle breathe.

People far lighter symptoms stage died, end. 

I swear, he's well, can't even believe anyone trying pretend he's cured now. meds chance?  references, data, anything opinion? people consider leading scientists??? getting old, death potential permanent outcome Stupidity far deadliest disease 

Sadly understatement. knew bad DT elected never realized bad Covid. tread me, breaux! Schools completely shut still many states Turns deaths non-covid patients misunderstood. Turns deaths non-covid patients misunderstood.

I think much ""better"" different. governor opinion? Probably something flu season 13 weeks long. Yeah. New York hospitals back March outdoor dining result many people dying try get in. Totally normal business. strict restrictions healthy people especially going forward. highest ever one day Sweden 1698 cases day. twice population Wisconsin.

Hopefully 3132 new cases Wisconsin younger people. mean can't wrong. wakefield's study books 12 years. yeah, know probably tell \*editorial board\* writing this- know who's board, whether members agree interpretations lead author article. South Korea, country held model response Covid-19, struggling contain new nationwide outbreak.

At forefront team dedicated government contact tracers, authority isolate test anyone suspected contact virus.

BBC Korea joins South Korea’s virus detectives battle long hours face biggest challenge: gaining trust cooperation suspected carriers reluctant provide personal information. northern states getting cold disease ridden shouldn’t open Disneyland fly spread Covid. exactly huge sample size 115 people. damn special type retarded Restrictions burdens travel U.S. states illegal. states enforcing fake quarantines can’t. California doesn’t need play theatre. damage caused fracking greater economic value provides?

Granted, understand long term sustainability issues peak oil that. pressing need end fracking urgently?

Just saying pressing need end COVID urgently.  Free ass paid charging us extraordinary prices pharma govt money aka money. Shit title, get patients without symptoms? mean cases maybe? symptoms testing time ever? Youve given awards alt account right? YA SAY fair though, subreddit's user base soundly rejected article variety noted reasons. Unfortunately sends standard policy lot hospitals. Reporting may actually meant anything hospital.

Or maybe selfish. Could either really. Dont count it, mask mandate people wear improperly basically useless Sure thing, moose division. [Article linked people live city license plate city lived before.

I moved change license plate, keep it. moved another district different license plate letters. Also, good news? 😂 Yes ask that. answer it. fact prove point.  remember beginning outbreak, everyone saying flatten curve? Flattening curve meant slowing disease could keep manageable level. never meant go away entirely. Even vaccine, would 50 percent effective. disease around long time, many years, forever. 

So according you, potentially lethal, one able come remote contact anyone else next several years 4 people thousand dying. live isolation next five years. saying? That's option see? thinking same. literally need security head frustrated trump. trump gets appoint loyalist, literally FUCKED!!!! Nothing posted. covid-19 working Quite frankly, people gotten lazy. smashed curve April, things slowly started opening up, many people seem basically impression need take precautions anymore. Luckily mask requirements public still widely enforced compliance pretty much 100 percent, people throwing large house parties causing major outbreaks constantly. Plus lots people went vacation (why allowed mystery me) brought back parties Mallorca Santorini. comment Serbia looks fine, looked data fear rule would apply. bunch edgelord comments here. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation initiative btw. plwasez get baseless snark in. true. contracted infectious disease college. Back thought invincible. got take experimental (now used often) treatment get rid carrier status. 10 years ago. realized last year many compounded issues resulted it. 22 good shape. still long term sequelae it. disease took Uncle contracted hospital heart operation. 

Trump sequelae rest life. definitely suffering. actually think even batshit tweetstorms physical pain translated rage. Steroids amplifying delusions. merely talking proposal great barrington declaration, one seems talking subreddit. Surely D-K aren’t strong Stanford professors/medic professionals lol. honesty happening much U.S. believe redditor.

My brother thankfully test positive covid, hospital breaking back combination strokes, seizures, hallucinations. doctors seriously concerned covid. Wore allowed ppe around him. allow visitors. whole bang, talked it. Still, came hospital explanation problems, saying covid really problem doctors afraid, etc.

Which concerning symptoms caused covid, real problem tests ineffective, many people experience symptoms, done long virus infectious them.

Like broke back. likely reason covid, still experiencing potentially life long side effects, stupid, blown there's reason take precautions. even matter can't work pick baby fiance get job, they're living father trailer. disconnect astounding. Seems like reporting would security concern lol Trump doesn‘t care „succers“ dies? one „Loosers“ DT don‘t likes. Even magically invisible, ships slow AF. *insert surprised pikachu* happens women every profession, unfortunately. wife zoom call one participants starting asking questions one male subordinates, yeah actually director accounting her......opps.

Do nothing, let murder.

Thank god spent last fifty years ensuring everyone opinions equally valid.  paper bear nuclear ICBMs... Right? Like, fuck, I'm working tons overtime spouse lost job I'm terrified losing mine, gym closed, country's verge civil war guess I've got fucking lose weight now, too? Nice deflection, seeing post replied entirety, completely pathetic one too. Yeah mormonism extreme lol Well, bet Putin acknologes lmao like straight deleted comment realise badly put place fall he's protecting since fault Yeah Arizona sucks! please stop moving everybody!  called Fox News say it. He's called twice today. hear Pence cancelled plans Friday returning DC instead? said it’s nothing worry about, don’t trust we’re told anything.  Yes, would choose safety profit DAY.

It sad pandemic resulted job losses around. think 1000 workers interests billion-dollar oil company donors bridge sell you.

The problem runs far deeper electoral college. Well tickle surprised news White House burgled /s say ?

Oh god. become hard tell?!  Everyone called Fauci lie. stop leading expert U.S. however. pretending one calling lie? constantly brought up. hindsight sure Wait. Seriously? thought getting top notch everything. Early entry, drugs now. You’re telling literally one planet received treatment ever fashion? (I’ve trying stand back bit news self care mechanism hadn’t delved portion news cycle). Even news U.S. somehow U.S. Maybe politicians stop acting like scientist We're 2nd wave Melbourne. We've lockdown couple months 10 cases day. entirely possible get top virus. I’m sorry she’s dealing stress. Hopefully, say, she’s adapting. Stress definitely detrimental. difficult sounds, knowing you’ve done much keep safe likely best mental approach. get much? would better leaving. Perhaps could private online tutoring. thought. oh ok sorry didnt enjoy it. hope happier wherever ended =) eyes prize???? idk  Conclusion: good time ease restrictions. anything effect vaccine. AKA lockdowns. feel sorry Americans, far removed effective efficient response coronavirus can't even imagine possible Yeah. I'd rather listen doctor random person Reddit. hey, that's me. dude...that link comment. know actually *read it*.

Anyway, since bother reading comment, bother reading yours. Bye! Turns it’s even gamble, that’s choice many western populated countries, absolutely way business lockdown continue till virus eliminated, nearly every European countries seeing massive surge right now, vaccine still least months away, plus going needed annually, factually incorrect Sweden deaths per capita Weird, right? Dining? best arugula Democrats want go subservient them, trust care well being. want know think say gospel act they're giving us ""handouts"" acting godly something. give two shits. Close office? never re-opened forced everything else open. front page capital website:

""Please note Florida Capitol currently closed visitors response COVID-19""  nope Wearing masks integrate mainstream society much like we've seeing Japan decades. guess nobody sub realizes ICU’s set run ~ 80% capacity normal basis. Hopefully puts perspective you. official stats almost correspondence happened. Everything got completely overwhelmed, testing data collection included I'd rather federal government get asses something. something mean hand checks corporations. Two years two half months (76 days) strict lockdown? Pick poison. prefer 76 days rip bandaid proper lockdown. seems high even though 10000 IU daily apparently safe. Even maintenance doses high. Hope following doctor see really need dosing. I'm tucson hit miss depending side town im in. paper Shouldn’t something like reported? I'm sure IFR would different. lack medical resources made situation really extreme, happened US. There's lot spread beyond 30%. friends' families infected. Even considering case fatality rate Sweden much higher US, probably due better access quality health care elderly Swedish care homes many cases receive health care all, mortality rate per million inhabitants actually higher US Sweden. curve mostly levelled here, seem US.

Time tell, long run, I'm sure Swedish option prove bad one. US 0.066% know actual deaths 40-50% higher reported real terms we'll likely 1/1000 dead end month already.  know Ducey re-election? PFRs 1% everywhere Europe, North America East Asia. 

If system collapses completely due huge wave infections get 2% too. put US map corona spikes overlapped 2016 electoral map, find something interesting. compare states country worst job developed world (ok Spain also sucks). Compare places actually done mitigate suffering death.

I live California time hear great job doing, really we're middle pack terms deaths per capita among states, we're complete failure compared countries good response.

If live Vermont apologize. Yeah kind hoping would get sick enough start taking things seriously. Seems might might have, enough people got infected event result might blast district get union involved could get access disposable PPE gowns… School districts don’t resources pay full biohazard suit… quite frankly don’t care get sick/die. did, wouldn’t forced go school buildings. software error, human error Lmao.. 2020, all?  one country invade another it’s wanting invade... Like one that’s aggressive towards it’s neighbors recently eye island property.... said mostly true, except Japan part.

Japan beaten thing, done next nothing hold spread. People staying own, that's changing. winter coming, Japan face biggest wave yet. also hold back testing matter policy save face. grew Salt Lake County. I'm surprised worse. Feel bad saying this, especially I've worked great (normal) LDS members, church insane hold state big reason left. nice normal state. Even democratic city Republican state infinitely better insanity around LDS rules, hypocrisy, insanity. cut dry like that. say usually. enter buildings? instance, groceries doctors office, etc? try take much precautions wonder others handle enter places. Similar thing county. Started mask mandate month ago within 3 weeks numbers cut half. point, ""breaking news"" thumbnail feels sarcastic. long see million cases per day? government promised invest money ever elderly care next year this.

The primeminister called ""sjujäkla satsning på välfärden"" - ""a f*cking crazy investment welfare"".

Found though interesting:

""Most care is funded citizen’s taxes. fact, Sweden allocates 3.6% GDP long-term care also provides highest number health care workers elderly age 65. result, surprising 2013, Sweden ranked first treatment elderly in United Nations (UN) supported global study, Global AgeWatch Index Yes. day. everything quite bit, even alcohol (especially helpful right now. : meds. Although show ID &amp; sign deliveries contact then.

It's Instacart use instacart app. sure use Costco.com site blue bar across home page listing different departments hover Same-Day Delivery local Costco powered Instacart. need Instacart membership.  hope feel better! Working special needs children tough. Hats you! George Carlin puts it: whoa... what!!?? weird works. would think doctors/scientists/public health officials would publicly make requests country. /s Nonsense. science getting figured out.

No one knew right answers front.

People proving incapable critical thinking.

I didnt problem getting informed (news + reddit), judging good bad sources (r/covid19), developing unreasonable conclusions (suckers buying plandemic), understanding people get things wrong time (aerosols vs droplets) agendas (conserve ppe)

People stupid. Go play Among Us see incapable people are.

People need educated. Hard vote intelligently people trained intelligent. American concur logic. Yeah. Alpacas tested though. see they’re dining. wish would said something like weed cures COVID something. Imagine America stoned time. Future Archaeologists would wondered gap history won't, worry. hope Governor DeathSentence charged murder. Going long fall winter. Time go back eating home again. can't honestly believe bullshit peddling right?  strategic elements defend larger dodgy decisions made past Trump get good shit got????? Calling someone merely holds different opinion butthead reveals kind person are. 

You probably spend 0 brainpower even consider alternative approaches, kind won’t put people isolation misery.

The matter fact loosey lockdown doesn’t work ruins people’s lives every possible way. point already damage problem try solve. lol places barely even them. lasted like week two. That's poor people are. infrastructure month? posted discussed days ago even though article todays date Higher infection rate low deaths best case scenario. means average age age infected people getting lower lower. prolonging inevitable, keeping elderly safe. Peru one strongest longest lockdowns spreading lies downplayubg virus, Thoughts prayers Republicans offer  I’m 29 pounds! last pound thirty frustrating! still working hard wish never gotten levels first place. Remember said 60-80K deaths ""worst case scenario""?? Costco delivers? know this. Bingo, came say this.



The amount ignorance journalism shown especially headline writers truly exacerbates problem ignorance broad societal sense. hmm.. would ya look that! Yeah 'member. 'member bleach bringing light body too, 'member bleach ligh? mean lockdowns supposed give us time get place could coordinate way operate somewhat normal society except mask wearing social distancing, studies shown done right need fully lockdown keep spread control, things need done right that. problem complete lack coordination, large portion country denying masks fighting them, places shutting neghboring cities running around without mask mandates, places completely different stages allowed isn't, places online school saying fuck following guidelines allow person school without mass spreading. hindsite might able avoid lockdowns could gotten everyone masks right away setup social distancing protocols right away stuff takes time, see people still following anyways. Yeah, statistically seems pretty straight forward. Add top untreated chronic illness. don’t huge sick population continents do. Stay strong &amp; mindful (i use often anxiety &amp; help alter thought process) moments pass continue heal &amp; help loved ones. sending virtual hugs &amp; many prayers position. far easy try succeed even slightest bit help. well &amp; father also~ Someone needs release ad Wisconsin - ""Wear mask, get Packers sick""

Seriously, Packers great team year - Wisconsinite would pissed team lose games / jeopardized championship run players got sick state get shit together forget, lot started Russia wanting sanctions lifted. Remember whole Trump tower meeting Jr rest? sanctions imposed Russia invaded Crimea attempt control petroleum markets flowing area Europe. sanctions kept ExxonMobile helping Russian oil industry extract shitton oil northern waters near arctic circle. ExxonMobile lead Rex Tillerson Trump's Sec State.

Russia technology expertise drill deep water oil wells arctic waters. need partnerships American oil companies it, largely Putin installed buddies heads companies soviet union broke basically ignorant mobsters trying run high-tech industry. Petroleum Russia's real export, huge wealth come flows pockets Putin oligarchs. 

They want continue can't without getting U.S. side, meaning need alienate us western allies, need cripple NATO EU. Go see local governor. feel you. governor *did* act, nutjobs planned raid state Capital kidnap her. Even could produce 350 million doses, still distribute, implement vaccination program get people vaccinated. take lot longer Q1 2021 even vaccine released tomorrow approved.

If approved vaccine tomorrow, might return ***modified*** normalcy Q1 2022.

I'm guessing Q3 2022 things start look relatively normal everything goes right. Keep mind 50% Americans saying **not** going take vaccine, could well mean never leave current predicament.  zero speed enforcement tons people coming countries without rural driving experience, absolutely danger zone. speak personal experience. love visiting Iceland, probably one favorites visit, holy shit close calls driving there. Thats goal basically countries, handful actually trying eradicate it. couple friends going Disney World week election. would never hope voting. Please help get rid Trump, 4 years would devastating head secret service? Welp.. Amen Mostly Florida. businesses open, limited hours, masks required enter. restaurants outdoor seating. restaurants, takeout only. dare Absolutely. mild scroll history show you.
 
I insanely embarrassed terrified country Republican primaries. president exceeded worst nightmares. saying forever, though. saying get used needed.

I think Mask mandates like 9/11 restrictions. supposed another type cloth, like coat cold. like coat protects body, different kind harm. time winter last 2 years.

People Korea used wearing mask fine dust China. think wear time, you? particularly severe usually severe. IMO, asking people get used beat people wearing mask; adopt culture mask wearing. sweden send kids 16 back school either. locked states even Canada.  majority transmission situations totally unrealistic expect people wear masks, mandating usage public limited effect. There's lot focus bars restaurants, except super-spreader events account relatively infections, assuming common sense social distancing rules. Whoa. AZ cheat take dog something? vast majority bible readers, Christians, you, conditioned believe enforce benefits themselves, actually makes one good human being. ""mormons"", vast majority people claiming want things I'm religious feel like virus seems special way punishing proud listen advise others much knowledgeable are. Unfortunately people still end hurting listen.  governor willing ask people ""do right thing"" without government intervention

Whoa, thought reading Iowa second there. governor ""trusts Iowans right thing"". trust badly misplaced. also pushes back cities mandate it, since state level, local enforcement never know city mandate looking around you. Texas covid deaths surpassed California.      
16,866 16,428 currently.      
(Texas 3/4 population California).   
    Fortunately unlike Russian opposition, trump enemies wish kill him. even take sick leave things still okay. Tide goes tide goes can't explain everyone needs stay home watch porn, something fun didn’t halt enough though... Recent data says 2800 cases kids 18 Utah. deaths. 36 hospitalizations, 4 went ICU. serious cases underlying conditions.  COVID already serious enough without exaggerating. 

Also, Utah 7th lowest deaths per million US. doctor friend thinks it'll somehow better anywhere else? man guess definitions ""really bad"" different. death rate lots mitigation measures like social distancing, bans large crowds, masks, etc. Trump DeSantis is? Ah. guess going bars movies super important. /s. worst thing sacrifice, got easy. nothing compared 20s 40s 60s. Wear mask. must see friends, make bubble set rules. It’s hard. group orders groceries, never leaves, see other. It’s possible. dont blame thinking outside looking in.

I really interest politics all, even people like neutral clear day people STILL calling lockdown democrats, supporters.

The lockdown restrictions severely hurt many aspects life, families life. Thats lockdowns point. Sure, lockdowns saving lives cost. Thats much arguing name calling.

If live US would see NOTHING like news would believe.  thing keeping corona relevant news stories people talking it. Dont fooled thinking corona running rapid. dont even know someone knows someone covid. friends many different states way over. Even get it, 99% chance youre fine.

Blown WAYYY proportion. Yea 100+ years we’ve known flu, disease killed far Covid has. 

Check mate! Masks pansies! 

.../s Comparing single day 7 day average make sense. There's lot ""jews"" few... understanding specific neighborhoods getting shut high transmission... makes want scream people want mental gymnastics politicize virus. also worth noting knew tested positive covid went debate Joe Biden, without mask, fact, hardly anybody side wearing masks. made fun Biden wearing masks debate. knowing covid. That's type asshole is. That’s first picture I’ve seen trump mask Assuming Trump loses 2020, happen Republicans Trump, uninvited, takes control Republican Party becomes presidential nominee 2024 presidential elections?

Other Republicans waiting years run President. lose 2024 republican primaries, Trump runs losing 2020? YA DON’T SAY Wow coincidence!! Made sound like Bill Gates finally controlled world injecting everyone nanobots 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻 facts want? Everyone estimating even fauci cdc videos front green screens? see overall points trying make Trump vain, narcissistic, idiot. That's covid begin with. He's protected person whole world he's full got covid refused follow protocols, he's willingly spreading service members, staff, planning making public appearances. He's complete joke making everything worse, feed ego/God complex. Right... stuff pretty much self-flattery, push comes shove, nope. Hmm. bet dollar donut got virus shithead-in-chief. thought... would known? No, it’s fake news! mainstream don’t show - put bs research - mean going cold flu season? 

Go figure. see coming happens every year? problem death. suffering, like [this us, it’s time day Ahwatukee. People morning cautious. Lol @ “most countries”. Pretty much Europe would like word. generally see three four shows year (Brooklyn/NYC). One things life gives real joy. Oddly enough, March/April six shows lined up, really excited see favorite new bands first time. remember beginning March starting wonder going go not. strange time. can't imagine feel safe spend couple hours dark, cramped space listening awesome music. really feel performers live music spaces crews. 2022 seem like earliest. Lol. Showing admitted two different things. may play part, CFRs across board, similarly countries strong mask mandates little mask use. mostly something else. going 1930's economic revolution, except instead angry economist writing regulating companies, recession cycles &amp; stock market abuse response great depression, SUSTAINABILITY STEWARDSHIP = FUCKING GOOD ECONOMICS/BUSINESS?

Its painfully obvious better take care people &amp; environment, better every business able operate. So... painfully... obvious, nobody seems getting message every institution corrupted giant unearned bags money inherited dimwitted boomers 70's &amp; 80's grew much latent radiation poisoning nuclear tests dooming terribly senile aged. one dog ""got"" covid later finalized living nose actually infected. Forgot country though... guess mandating seat belts violation human rights? I'm certain country 0 infection informed dont implement wide public testing. significantly ill cases tested coronavirus. know majority cases showed symptom.

Local tourism resumed tourist industry relies foreign visit mostly. Restaurant opening usual small ones closing cant handle rent. Shitty situation chaotic US anw. a.k.a. Red Vetting Melbourne checking in. Hoping join guys soon. lot folk wearing masks correctly. Got face dicks hangin mask face shield. Face shield cut bud. often poorly fitted.  I'm sick hoax China Flu already. Open up! 99% survival rate! tyrannical Democrats want control!





/s already know data looks like. 80% excess deaths covid. 800 today ?
I mean ontario freaking want end like neighbors...  last week National Security Advisor earlier term publicly accused Trump treason.... nobody gave shit.

Trump done thousand things would gigantic scandals administration, get completely ignored. Green sus Yeah, I'm big fan earlier movies, especially Bad Taste republicans working strategy years.   

Repeat lie enough times.   That’s need propaganda shows every possible media outlet. 

Remember, 50% population slow average intelligence, another 10% aren’t much smarter. Yeah, know epidemiologists immunologists virologists microbiologists(such myself)

The Dunning Kruger strong you.

Laters  coughing allowed! Lol part country?  missed cases spring still mess CFR. decline religion, people move racial political affiliations self-identify.

and football clubs, movie fandoms etc.

Tribalism nature humanity. necessary, measures fight covid19 works well influenza virus. Yes, get one maybe likely get other, hospitals tight situation already. case back spring early summer, large scale testing common. yes, many cases back difficult cases - often fatal - tested.

Still, known fact many elderly received proper medical care all. shameful, that's happened. right, would 90s, old brain letting down. Oh no, dont like animal violence, give one pass. Feel free enjoy Peter Jacksons original wierd stuff. Meet feebles particularly mind bending. Lockdowns never necessity. defend conspiracy theories believe freedom information exist propagate. freedom speech net strength freedom thought go it. thoughts undermined speech longer free. 10 years

22 years. curve flattened sufficiently. countries lockdown 4 months lol.

It's weird countries always argue like Europen permanently locked bar Sweden. Since May open places. know pick Sweden's nearest neighbors, Finland Norway, even though two nations arguably similarities Sweden region world.

Based what?

What makes Scandinavia somehow different rest world? would like hear _argument_. There's massive demographic societal differences countries. would know lived several them. Southern Hemisphere actually really mild flu season due precautions COVID source code extremely wild. worked reworked since Dec/Jan.  REGN making gamble pump dump scheme. What's stock price gonna Trump croaks? SEC really needs investigate trading news. mean 90s?

In ways Bad Boy Bubby can't really topped gross factor, mainly mother-son thing. least Aussie movies I'm aware of. Wake Fright actual violence towards animals (kangaroos, is), lot people would probably put ahead BBB. Crazy.  be. doesn’t. Swedes test much, CFR somewhat doubtfull. How? I'll compare anything pick, pick worst outcomes world Sweden look slightly better, telling something. Let's compare world average like, third world African nations. 

I know pick Sweden's nearest neighbors, Finland Norway, even though two nations arguably similarities Sweden region world. Hmm, wonder why? #1 reason nations keep strict immigration border controls countries like U.S., India, Brazil, Russia ham-fisted stridently opposed locking keep source new outbreaks.

But keep telling lockdowns, enforced quarantines, aggressive contract tracing places like Vietnam (land border China) South Korea (regular air travel China), work, champ. everyone could keep even weeks could prevent thousands cases. Still much upward trend. reaching one. Daily deaths states holding steady, spiking. thought seen worst bad boy Bubby, rite passage 80s NZ show us truly wierd Aussies are. What’s holding governors mandate mask-wearing states?  love bars clubs, can‘t really make safe pandemic. People get drunk, shout others ears, touch hug, etc ... Lots fun virus around, perfect petri-dish it‘s there. Winter going fucking tough. Nothing said discounts fact death rate incredibly low primarily kills old people. average age death 82. Punishing everyone save tiny don’t even remember year never right move. Add document. work retail mall fairly rich conservative city California jaw dropping thing I'm seeing many parents bringing kids shopping masks all. I'm talking every I'm talking HEAVY vast majority put 0 mask kids bring crowded mall. told lady bring kid store without mask flipped out, called ""stupid fucking re**rd"" demanded speak manager. told manager husband jump security rope (we use make sure store go capacity) get face demand name take picture saying would legal action taken. people every day sad seems care right childs safety. Accurate according USA. mean year. would like see scientific studies claimed exist shows covid19 death completely preventable social distancing mask-wearing? lying criminal offense would politicians around anymore people would jail. Maybe bad suggestion end. 100% fair people politicized ones change that. 

I'm working project I'm documenting pandemic looking people share experiences, thoughts feelings virus.

I would like incorporate handwritten experiences, thoughts feelings virus book. could good/bad short long whatever feeling!

If anybody wants help out, let know 😁 Great Barrington infectious disease epidemiologists public health scientists grave concerns damaging physical mental health impacts prevailing COVID-19 policies, recommend approach call Focused Protection. left right, around world, devoted careers protecting people. Current lockdown policies producing devastating effects short long-term public health. results (to name few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings deteriorating mental health – leading greater excess mortality years come, working class younger members society carrying heaviest burden. Keeping students school grave injustice. measures place vaccine available cause irreparable damage, underprivileged disproportionately understanding virus growing. know vulnerability death COVID-19 thousand-fold higher old infirm young. Indeed, children, COVID-19 less dangerous many harms, including influenza. immunity builds population, risk infection – including vulnerable – falls. know populations eventually reach herd immunity – i.e. point rate new infections stable – assisted (but dependent upon) vaccine. goal therefore minimize mortality social harm reach herd immunity. compassionate approach balances risks benefits reaching herd immunity, allow minimal risk death live lives normally build immunity virus natural infection, better protecting highest risk. call Focused Protection. measures protect vulnerable central aim public health responses COVID-19. way example, nursing homes use staff acquired immunity perform frequent PCR testing staff visitors. Staff rotation minimized. Retired people living home groceries essentials delivered home. possible, meet family members outside rather inside. comprehensive detailed list measures, including approaches multi-generational households, implemented, well within scope capability public health professionals. vulnerable immediately allowed resume life normal. Simple hygiene measures, hand washing staying home sick practiced everyone reduce herd immunity threshold. Schools universities open in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, sports, resumed.

I'd walked away trash heap could have. depends consider ""safe"". countries use 3', use 2m, use 10' Others nothing all. evidence physical separation one another reduces spread load virus infected individual present? Yes. still contract virus distances greater 6'? Also yes. make best decision people regularly contact comes whether visit space might come contact circulated air closer 10' people? Also yes.

Not hard. I'm sure called second wave daily cases remain 4k since May. true? Please provide source. Worth noting due multiple false positives past combined lack symptoms, may waiting result confirm false positive, never arrived. 

I 4 false positives different clinics Miami, negated taking 2nd test within following 2 days. However must tell 3rd 4th didn’t even social distance afterwards, symptoms experience 2 false positives before. kind assumed would right false (3&amp;4) right. Trump probably assumed happened wrong. That’s life, wouldn’t shit someone that. also like 10 ft away nearest person debate. According fauci that’s enough distance infected person about. They’re one small handful countries (including Mexico Zambia) Americans travel without quarantine place 14 days, wonder goal bring American tourists? No, not, measures taken prevent Covid also prevent normal flu. See Southern Hemisphere proof concept. easiest flu season modern history. I’d imagine prison staff would included. Here’s great interview whole vaccine roll process, you’re interested: think disagree objective. believe shutdown avoid overwhelming healthcare system, Florida done successfully. Defenestration great Slav tradition. lost 25 pounds. borderline obese now. still, already caught infection resulted near sepsis low oxygen perfusion causing cyanosis, so....im probably fucked either way point. Sociopaths like need seek help.  People fed bullshit. morbidly obese man coronavirus hospital death sentence.

Paul Waldron morbidly obese county commissioner Florida voted mask mandate right went hospital Covid-19 hospital back work.

Of course, plenty patients preexisting condition die. whole world lying amount cases ands deaths. terrifying wonder real numbers ever come always love sweep shining example human race deserves extinction carpet. There's ten minutes left soccer game. One team 150 goals - who's won? vaccine bragging about... that’s case, need stop driving cars. many people die year driving work? many die driving work?

Also, lose credibility using epa value life. It’s basically double govt agency, guarantee insurance company paying much wrongful death claim. classes full? mask mandates? lmao fuck off. russian people get sympathy stand gov. People dying suffering comply public health measures.  done trying appease people extend duration pandemic make far worse needs be. numbers high, aren’t going down? They’re going up, least. Yet. opened up. I’m going wait another week so. conversation evidence support one theories. Maybe middle path reasonable instead viewing humans as, know, non-human animals prodded beaten submission. smart. It’s breath fresh air.  Remember hospital built weeks? seem like 5 years ago others here? pandemic messing sense time, least still got sense smell taste. - herd immunity strategy
- Sweden acted little late
- Many elderly died given palative care morphine instead proper hospital care

All well documented. lies coming try cover truth. Good job cure.. havent they? looking another way mass testing back April showed numbers now, perhaps many cases today.

The country (like many others) restriction fatigue increasingly non-compliant population. Lmao.

Le Trump. take much glee rubbing everyone's faces livelihoods destroyed Every day threads? fair call approaching ""second wave"" first wave even stopped? people spoke second wave earlier pandemic, brought assumed first wave would've slowed down. hasn't. second wave lot countries, first stopped. USA, except anti-mask people enabled highest levels federal government. Listen guys. Make sure put gasoline gasoline tank vehicle. else, won’t work! world leaders

What's that? Covid mortality rate .6%, nobody putting life hold YEARS avoid getting not, Trump kin admitted they're suppressing numbers. state 1500 yesterday Viruses mutate get worse fall people crowd inside.

Testing matters too. essentially evolutionary pressure virus. Viruses evade testing successful replicate rapidly. tip: wear mask

its good solid tip. save life. kinds system place yet last 10 months, consistently FAILED deploy them. Even CDC, built specifically fir exact scenario, consistently failed keep us properly informed protected.

All vaunted resources, systems, failed even get test kits timely manner. get out, either broken contaminated. test kit situation alone took us 3 months sort out, another 3 properly deploy.

We failed basic contact tracing. Completely failed, want us believe magically get shit together vaccine available?

What world living in?

Loom around you. failed! systems failed! institutions failed leadership failed!

fully 50% Americans signalled take vaccine. know means?

it means vaccination program fail, even ccouk magically deploy tth vaccine everyone. first question would know difference capacities Disney parks zoo/aquarium/food events comparing to. I’m sheep??? gates foundation literally funding vaccine development.

From FEAR FOOLS COMMENTS flat. Trending up. happening everywhere. Young people getting together organizing things. detrimental dangerous least they're getting herd immunity. 

We might actually need herd immunity active group one hand enough vaccines vaccines going stop spread. bat-soup crazy Thanks! good way practice handwriting times 😉 think getting risk people vaccinated may take longer we’d prefer, since US huge risk population. That’s preference would make decisions based vaccine adoption, reopen fatigue 5-10% people vaccinated, it’ll complete disaster. actually disproves green screen right there. Thanks timestamp! world leaders holding CCP responsible COVID??? Articles like accelerate return normal light end tunnel people stop taking precautions. vaccine even deployed widely yet? Yep. ass. problem sizable portion American population think sacrifices WWI WWII generations also sacrifices, anyone asking make sort concession sacrifice committing heresy. feel like I've really fucked way thanks advice. curbside pick favorite local brewery, I'm drinking ever pandemic.

Doubley frontline workers risk vaccinated spring. excel spreadsheet accurate. concerns deaths hospitalizations, seen spike.

Much people could motivation. lot factories stopped people paid government weeks. Sport Billys stubborn go back sport routines immediately Covid? It’s higher yes. Average cases per day week 300, 400, 500 week around 600. it’s safe say it’s increase. explosive Denmark’s increase weeks. Hopefully Sweden like Denmark flatten it.

People going area. kills 6% infected people age group. course - republicans act surprised? That's terrible won’t case tomorrow. 170 deaths today push rolling average up. 715 million cases?

China, India, USA, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia Mexico make 4.5 billion people - that's half world's population. one(s) countries extra 700 million cases reported? China India even enough people that. Or, spread around one called another country lying stats?

To me, math add up. would need literal doubling every 10 days order hit that. around 375 million infected people right then. listened audio either Dr. Ryan idiot hella misspoke meant 1% 10%.

OR... thing dangerous we're one month saturation/herd immunity. 


EDIT: typo/grammar even buys time magazine 0 evidence masks effective beginning. ""open everything up"" person know said ""the heat supposed take care it.""  replied ""maybe did"". I’m surprised Republican governor would put masks mandate So, basically saying less death somehow better, time arguing death bad. You’re literally chasing tail. arguing word semantics me. It’s death. doesn’t matter meant it, doesn’t matter claim veganism cause less (it won’t). Something died could live. fact kill eat stop pretending didn’t harvest wheat made bread aren’t implicit deaths mice rabbits insects. are, farmer tell there’s way system.

If Brazil, Mexico, UK, Italy, Peru, Spain, France 100% infection, that's 750 million people. Sounds pretty unlikely.

Where are/were 715 million cases? That's ask - someone say believe actual totals are:India - 300 millionChina - 300 millionUSA - 100 millionand on.

So tested found 10% antibodies places. Great. That's local sampling. Show work - extract 10% global infection?

Tell countries make 700 million missing cases I'll shut up. 10% every country? couple countries large populations hid hundreds millions cases?

Are telling hundreds millions cases mild one bothered seek medical treatment them? so, mean overall, thing deadly all? stats places like New York state sure seem imply pretty damn deadly.

I'm confused - either thing infected 700 million people ONE NOTICED Dr. Ryan pulling numbers ass, said ""10% infected globally"" ""10% infected pockets around globe."" 


edit: added words Please listen comment drug used trumps treatment used kind research abortion bans want ended. Ya wasnt recallin name atm.

Hes great Huh. Yes much qualified I’m glad hear that, least opinion, I’m source misinformation. 

See, didn’t even know coronaviruses caused common cold. aware “rhinoviruses” cause common cold. take viruses qualify both, coronaviruses get much airtime?

I recently became aware NoNewNormal started posting there. got sense description wasn’t clear. asked someone specifically “is covid denialist sub something, lol?” obviously didn’t get straight answer, shit ton downvotes 🤣. I’ll visit lockdown skeptics now. New Zealand longer lockdown, public events virtually unrestricted, spent far fewer days lockdown countries. locked hard beginning, aggressive testing contact tracing. Vietnam one new case per day, US 46,000 cases per day That's madness. I'm across border Illinois also disturbingly high 3000 cases today. also twice many people whopping 72,000 tests today. Illinois OK-ish, literally every surrounding state worse matter time things get bad too. Imagine thinking vaccine makes immune point life return normal. helps body defend real infection. make immortal. still get covid jab, still die jab.

It's different virus jab. Like flu shot seasonal. still get flu flu shot. still die flu flu shot. still spread flu others. 

People really know anything vaccines. Gov Ducey jus recently opened state restrictions think days ago US wasn’t normalized didn’t think it. Obviously stayed home sick could I’ve definitely learned lot year. 

Not sure you’re trying turn gotcha moment? Musician here. one gig last month. 2020. Sang front White House. spent whole month fuming preparing it. video it. cathartic me, would love share anyone interested. Science weird like Pepperidge Farm remembers. Jeez, stupidity (of Trump head security) mind-boggling. He’s infected many people bet none getting even 1/4 care medication he’s gotten. poor guy job, easily preventable think propaganda full force thread. 

People pretending government making everyone stay home never see another person. That's propaganda. 

I see family lot, using mitigations recommended. meet friends, one time. talk phone Skype. text. talk neighbors fence. invite children help yardwork. wear masks, outside.

 hard?

How ""not life?"" ""living bunker, terrified?"" 

The answer? 
They lockdown skeptics coordinated campaigns. goal tell people disease mitigation INTOLERABLE ""go back normal"" *for them*. Ha. I'm getting sick benefit. way. seen lung scans? Bleh Fucking Duh!!!

Republicans: debate still masks... live surprise occasionally get every 5 days groceries ppl really getting laxed, every store go clearly sign door states mask mandatory soon walk store ppl mask around bottom chin Yeah faster longer. optics would bad. 

“Head Coronavirus Task Force tests positive coronavirus” mean would headline basically sums plight entire country history fuck comfortable amount US cases? Yup. We've 2 cases work. mild. everyone like ""see bad."" roll eyes. avg person process severity something percentages ""low"" within massive numbers (330,000,000 Americans). see 1 4 people dying see bad. 1 100 1000 horrible consider 330,000,000!! tell 99 100 cases see close survive....it register horrific. Lanna..................lanna................................LAANNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!

WHAT??????????

*snickers* Danger Zone  ""...in return."" That’s travesty got best socialized medicine! ask uncle Jim Crow Joe! 2+2=5 literally political statement Twitter tankies. supposed trust protect country can't even protect white house getting people sick? I’m pretty sure meant 10%. I’ve following serology testing pretty closely countries 10% 20% worlds population China probably &lt; 1%. I’d shocked, 10% entire world population infected. Giving point estimate without range close scientific malfeasance. needs better job messaging. Still think that? zoom

lol state. We’ve smart. deaths per capita way average lot restrictions place. right way. California resident, makes happy sad. Sad layoffs happy hope severly discourage out-of-staters coming pandemic over, ESPECIALLY anti-mask states. 

I also can't help wonder completely baffled California enacted 14-day quarantine policy people traveling state like states started months ago; NJ example. Oh Houston level fake hysteria. I'm fucking shocked. *Americans trying flee Canada*
""no, expect find one us wreckage brother"" Basically 100% infection? Honestly, that's completely normal. invisible enemy, people smart.

This *mandate* essential. Singapore, initially uproar mask mandate enforced (uproar means people complaining still authoritarian government).

Now, 6 months later almost 0 community spread countries unfortunately still sufferring, strict actions taken (make mandate, social distancing measures etc.) turned non-believers believers. age distribution country mean expected death rate 100% infection?   Idk, I've never seen saggy snake before. guess there's flappy spitty Dino jurassic Park... Maybe he's hiding flappies?

After hitting send thought: could also Denobulin, covering inflatable face human face skin... federal government needs stop spreading misinformation, (Trump) obviously influenced idiots country masks, turn put pressure governors enforce mask-wearing. wear mask 2020 then? understand science? averages derived statistical models, actual reported influenza deaths. reality, number people die flu year much lower. 


Sadly, opposite COVID-19, least next year two. Please open eyes read story. Take blinders, gogels get echo chambers. sick prior Sept 26. false. accurately predicted deaths state since March. problem? fats? moment eleven biggest cities talk Chancellor Merkel. predicted happening back June got told""you're full shit, stop spreading fear!"" 300 people got mAbs pace pandemic production possible tiny fraction cases. Sweden deathrate 58 per 100.000, UK 64. like, golden sweden. Also already mentioned, Swedish residents followed logical safety guidelines simply asked. want vaccine stop cases asymptomatic ones?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* RKI chief really angry today Merkel talks eleven biggest german cities. 100% agree. Japan's response basically like America's people actually listened government followed safety precautions. response minimal, overall.

The government really done much tell. Testing really occurs event fever... symptoms without fever turn way.  PEOPLE though wear masks everywhere, limit contact, use hand sanitizer, somewhat social distance. Also, people Japan generally seem quite healthy, maybe helped.

Because many guidelines, businesses, part, remained open malls continue packed weekends (even rises cases.). I'm honestly shocked things bad (I'm Osaka, Japan). Walk around city park weekend would never even know Covid thing...  Yup, Milwaukee county here. get shamed wearing one. one conservatives argued last year used aborted fetuses one?

Either way, hear peep year Bottom line , people feel safe going like pre corona days.

They would lifted restrictions stopped reporting it. Flu season starts month two kids go back school. Even Florida. Really hope ban mink farms Europe kill fur industry, sake little guys. Serbia surrounded countries much infections. greece still relatively well. Competent healthcare professionals high demand across Europe. case surge covid cases, stop elective surgeries concentrate treating covid patients emergiencies. Still less active. remove sticky occasionally 80% vaccines coming six weeks, 50% vaccines now. Get approved. calculate last seven days new cases long paid someone, never unbiased. Widger, senior director global communications Pfizer, said company hopes submit vaccine candidate federal approval late October 2020.

Get Now, let's conflate correlation causation! /s Dunno, whole article bit weird, first thought Monday Sweden reporting cases clearly write Wednesday Italy/Germany ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ agree fronts. thing would like see maybe flu season ppl start wearing masks. least certain environments. Restaurant kitchens example. places lead widespread infections. hate this. Open fucking theaters right fucking now. Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* R/coronavirus basically r/coronavirusUS Imagine looking around state things thinking comment worth making lack brain power see obvious, control. Make sure nobody *eats* anymore, might spread food Whitehouse head security dies Covid-19 later Trump gets assassinated really Covid-19 killed Trump ? 🤔 far know colleagues China, already back work many travelling week national day celebrations. see pictures people masks.

Yea, keep lying suppressing information. can't keep virus silent. “China joining COVAX serves dual purpose filling leadership vacuum left United States terms global public health, terms securing future vaccine population,” said Natasha Kassam, research fellow Lowy Institute Australia.

----

The United States, world’s largest economy, declined join President Donald Trump, saying alliance “influenced corrupt China.” China second-largest economy world. go find sure lying?

Instead, sit around repeating what's said thousand times. 

Useless ever. older people absolute get one. help Covid. Hm? Kids 16 lost day school. Good thing normal healthy people don’t die COVID. Even trump handled fine. Look statistics course senior staff old takes years climb ranks make White House. 

That times, Trump heading things, vaguely know him, given money point life, acting head NSA, CIA SEC, etc... Yes makes happy, not. 

Doesn't hurt us anyway. Different groups getting infected, another reason. First wave hit basically everyone equally, since worst spread happened anyone taking preventative measures. made worse lack PPE testing, medical personel able stop spread among vulnerables (care homes, hospitals). vulnerable medical personel better protected. slightly vulnerable still cautious disease mostly infecting otherwise healthy working age adults school children. Grandparents can't stay isolated ever, still avoiding big events social distancing. think Christmas real test. many people going home families. 

And guess Thanks Giving friends US. also, 3 weeks election, knows bring. That's good news. Rush vaccine. making attempt stop would irrelevant. ratios like that, would unable stop matter tried. knew! Already did.  Wisconsinite

But aren't, post /r/aznidentity /r/sino, hate subs. Maybe giving advice slogans ads. theme parks mostly outdoors? Better soon late. use logic cause death though. significantly that, that's coming due soon personally guaranteed invader unable suppress population unknown version, guns sudden evenly distributed around US invader would make attempt stopping happen ""yes we've taken control town/city, feel free bring guns give stop you"". Yes is. believe country, know better common conspiracist like you. Ain't gubberment telling live life! Adhominem. country big china local cases 48 days?? Sure thing... Second waves inevitable virus contagious. science predicting months now. want second wave start first killed $200k+ much less?

Also - lots evidence never left first wave. Liberals making covid political issue probably disgusting thing I’ve seen. Really opened eyes sides thing.. it’s fucking true man Stop make political..the Virus doesn´t care vote for.   We're eye storm. Excel initially intended database software, past, saw lot people companies so, customers market shares, developed ""patch tools"" able work databases made Excel.
and people get later stuck big complex stuff made Excel They’ve never said anything sort.

Being aware smart cautious potential life altering effects isn’t afraid.

It’s stupid. concerned- i’d yourself, everyone else might spread to. 100% secure sure. guarantee! want improve odds contracting disease, make sure keep air flow going. Open car windows (the more, better). Keep time together car minimum. Perhaps sit back seat. confuse deaths cases? isnt happened coronavirus caused pandemic eventually became cold virus?  point is, true Sweden really rules, strict US south less testing cases less population density results really suck comparison mean manage create magic bullet like expect god damn Nobel Prize cause discovered antibiotics viruses. exhausting doctor, according article, ***beg*** residents adhere publc health measures.

We many deaths early (still worst US deaths/pop) compliance better. Nowhere near number Covid deniers. Many believe science (which something never realized near universal first-world countries).

I wasn’t commenting number Covid deaths. We’ve way, way more. dutch, lived Korea majority year i'm deeply embarrassed actions dutch government. knew coming act way late. made many wrong decisions refuse act people opposed economy. Netherlands gathered coronapatients 1 week South Korea entire year. really appaling i'm ashamed fellow countrymen Sure, they're something worth monitoring, US approximately 150 spy satellites, really think they're capable monitoring every ship every moment. separate Covid too? makes 60,000 vs 200,000 kind misleading. Platypi poisonous kangaroos box. Also, would kangaroo pogo stick? sounds sketchy. Hi, I'm looking daily new cases Sicily Italy. found [this page](http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&amp;id=5351&amp;area=nuovoCoronavirus&amp;menu=vuoto) italian health ministry contains recent daily new cases, document **history** daily new cases. anyone know realiable source information? Ideally want see *7-day incidence per 100.000 inhabitants* Sicily.  They'll move goalposts again. lockdown would ever good enough. Rather ones making aircraft one safest mode transportation decades. ???? how? Let's *extremely* generous assume China's entire army invaded (2.18 million). Let us generous assume occupied United States zero resistance took significant casualties, well ignoring fact large percentage support personnel ground troops. exactly expect prevent US population organizing arming ratio 150 civilians 1 soldier? lot nurses doctors care beds though.

Berlin (Charite) voiced concerns staffing today. warn severe cases may need transported places Germany situation worsens, possibly far away Berlin. 38 Covid-19 ICU patients, 3.1% capacity, 195 (15.9% total capcity) ICU beds empty available right now. guess want available time, case terrorist attack happens Russian opposition politicians need post-Novitchok treatment.

So good start second wave. almost like cultural differences huge impact virus contained. fate less preferable death. fucking nightmare. Please, love everything decent practice proper distancing (even 6ft whenever possible) wear mask properly! think meant current rate, exactly exponential (at least way think it). Textbook exponential growth would R = 2 (aka, every infected person infects two others). US, current growth 1 nationally, means pandemic spreading fast feared earlier year NYC took hard hit, going away either. pandemic America currently sustainable slight growth. people listening ex-reality TV star comes disease?

Why people listening scientists who've spent lives studying diseases instead? Upvote comment Absolutely. start phrase ""vast majority"". clear. Can't say implying that, giving potential reason it... NK Average covid length infection: 24 hours shit Corona, yes. layoffs....Could anything $15/hr min wage put place last year? 6 months past America changed one bit. 100% hiding numbers.

[Citation needed] would say direct stakeholders issue (aeroplane companies) conducting studies even greater ""effect"". habitually lie suppress literally anything makes look bad. kinda makes even angry Tool went ahead concert area despite community spread detected. felt Danny Justin totally irresponsible going NBA game night show, well.

For record, ticket show waited 10 years for, would first show ruined shitty date, go. umm asian nations? new zealand, australia? even parts US? youre talking much travel, bro.. think europe outbreak talking much travel lmao rocket science. everyone travel wore masks religiously, problem. Cases largely irrelevant long resolve without incident, especially brings us closer herd immunity. Hospitalization/deaths matter. happened Sputnik vaccine? city, hospitals already straining cases almost doubling every 10 days, cannot even dare talking closing restaurants bars. closing them, cannot even suggest closing them. measures meek impossible enforce. know going hospitals overrun, going happen soon. win6der Trump knows somebody don't. Countries dealt SARS largely used methods contain covid. fucked beginning course things appear normal again. might last forever.

So? last forever (it probably will, I'm telling you), lasts forever. going adapt new normal. like many experts saying recently. collective impatience inherent selfishness. We're screwed. Everybody made mind virus proper way exist March they're going move it. ""just flu"" also airborne Ebola. Good luck getting people move middle ground on... well, issue.

Trump blind squirrel found nut said need learn live virus. one side wants live *despite* virus keep things exist. side takes hardline stance can't even try live somewhat normally virus gone. There's bringing two sides together. Better safe sorry, goes wrong destroy face vaccins many people stop vaccinating putting lots people risk otherwise preventable diseases. lets careful right. live Chicago would like participate study, visit scan.northwestern.edu take survey! Well, Brazil run asshole dictator, surprise there...Mexico take seriously all.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms countries there, mystery Argentina. locked long ass time spiking. even going bother responding everything since posted deleted...

Like claiming start counts February. say knew fomite transmission begining. evidence? article april.

Two full months date claim acknowledging start this.

Make mind instead spewing whatever bullshit think might stick. asked polarization surrounding mask Yeah, that's ridiculous. absurdity. wear seatbelts. smoke trains, planes taxis anymore, even restaurants. There's reasons things. know. feel like there's twist idea personal freedom somehow freedom able walk anybody's house take dump meal shout ugly things grandma. That's freedom is. Freedom ability pursue lifestyle, pursue want family, future, education want get. freedom comes responsibility look yourself, neighbor, family, everybody. compromises come along freedom. I'm sure that's difficult grasp. nah. fuck Russia massive troll shops contribute decisiveness us made fucking make political issue.  ""You clear choice election either oppo- oh dear, seems died. anyone else wanted opponent race?"" Imo let's approach issue like environment. like imagine world zero emissions 100% renewables 50 years, imagine kids growing 50 years stress eating foreign concept child smoking cigarette, widespread use asbestos. Here's hoping surpass 1000+ daily cases

At rate we'll smash 1000 three days. Exponential growth FTW!

/s bad herd immunity case they're still reporting thousands new positives day? yeah buddy cracked system, Chinese people evil 🙄🙄🙄just shut already supposed comment like this? 🤣🤣 none that. Send Walter Reed, they'll 3 days. work.miracles there. TDaP well. chaulked positive knew body immune response whole point. Man, I'm sorry hear that. feeling right now?
A: Well no. still cough. Every day, coughing fits lungs still damaged tips. got inflammation going wrist hands. autoimmune attack system form of, like, rheumatoid arthritis. Basically, understand, attacks weird spots random. hear people pretty terrible wearing mask. -\_-

&amp;#x200B;

In Germany moment I'm surprised shit worse many people give AF Berlin. Came earlier thought. weeks. Next lockdown NZ around reckon. whole ""we idea came from"" song dance I'm sure. yeah title implies precursor even caused huge spike repeat early wave 1 live MN wedding got busted indoor limit attendees due COVID restrictions (I think 250 people). Last seen ~60 people tested positive *there people symptomatic refused get tested.* Utter insanity. thought Russia announced coronavirus vaccine? case, could happen? Let cite wonderful website. ""On long enough timeline, everyone's survival rate drops zero."" people dying would laughing fucking hard rn

Turns kick eventually catch even read article? said people got mild case 3 months immunity. try zinc, oleander bleach?  Hmmmm???

What kind idiot complains someone statistical analysis back claims(made professionals) makes entire post feelings anecdotes correct.


Conservatives dumbest people world. things true.
China data trusted (all governments making data, China different). measures took comparable anything done west. 

I live Europe. girlfriend Hong Kong, relatives there, well continental China. sometimes compare measures coubtry China. things China did, even legal here, let alone tolerated public opinion. 

 unarguably worse political system, less freedom, accountability power, tyrannical rules, also true makes far easier lock people, fact got things insert control earlier surprise. would too, could establish draconian rules. really kidding. think big deal. kind hoped obvious brought cost flushing water, type commode used flush water, number times occurs work me. Regardless that, always appreciate positive, helpful, productive comment like happen lol. Especially enough make sure look sarcastic, one hundo percent fault.

I gonna start taking pictures dong flushing urinals evidence send tax claims also. want know, Australia know, Australians responsible now. science says safe, I'll support it. one effective soon seems bit hopeful though. rushed? Bad food advertising marketing needs dialed back 80%

Obesity unhealthy lifestyles collosal issues countries population. Shit like candy checkouts chemists illegal. would make much shit illegal.

All bus road advertisements shit food. Everything tv, get rid it. Nobody planet needs it. stayed lockdown without beefing hospital capacity?

They know point right? many make trek every year tho snowbirds? AZ always start seeing influx midwesterners mid-late October. There's lockdown live, look around see lock down.

But sure, devolve name calling instead posting type evidence (because any.) reality teachers dying remarkable rates countries schools open. lot American teachers health issues make vulnerable COVID, obesity included. People like forced work onsite schools, Americans take welfare workers seriously country, least teachers. That’s true. many Christians, Muslims, Sikh, etc parties. It’s Biden popular democratic nominees stay moderate. hard.  much worse Facebook point. least people Facebook pretend civil since know there's good chance friends see post. woman red looks like damn ninja first glance. blood full enough vodka kill virus? I'm surprised  5009 cases compared little comment month ago lol. Y’all explode soon enough, enjoy Covid douchebag region two months everyday official data reports 60/70% positives symptoms 20/25% mild symptoms.
During lockdown would get swab cough 37.5 temp. one would get swab. test contacts doctors prescribe swabs request (or people pay tested will).
Daily testing capacity area 450 beginning lockdown, 6000 peak.
Today 10800.
I sure unfortunately deaths increase always lagging behind whole scenario different.

You right lag.
So let's try find might cause spike.

Bars restaurants issue? reopened may 18th. Maybe lombardy spreading infection? Lombardy reopened rest country june 3rd. Gyms? May 25th.
Movie theaters? Reopened jine 15th.
It's evil tourists bringing back virus italy reopening money? Foreign travel allowed since june 15th. Public transportation smart working? state emergency smart working rules extended jan 31st 2021 may 18th.

So happened 3/4 weeks ago? Schools reopened. are.  woman red looks like either really cool NPC late-game boss.

The guy though..... “The situation grave getting so, daily hourly basis,” Robin Swann said written statement regional parliament. number COVID-19 hospital inpatients would exceed numbers seen first wave pandemic two three weeks current trends continue unabated, said.

“I advised restrictions Northern Ireland likely required near future” cases keep going up, said.

Northern Ireland’s devolved government imposed tighter restrictions household mixing last month week banned indoor dining, drinking unnecessary travel hardest-hit area Derry Strabane. entirely possible.  planet past breaking point. ""A thief thinks everyone steals"" comes mind.  Young people places gotten ontop covid much damage.

It's complacency, risk taking youth. Devastating Please stop posting everything Gates says Covid here? like everyday this... he's tech billionaire opinion blasted like this. even disagree want hear doctors scientists rather see Bill's 'I'm good billionaire' PR campaign. Tax return? 

Maybe tax works differently Australia though. I've claimed electricity, heating, water costs working home 2020 tax claim. need evidence tax claims. thing ""herd immunity"" coronaviruses. People get reinfected CCCs every year.

There absolutely evidence suggest different one, quite opposite, antibodies fade fast, quite reinfection cases fully documented already, many thousands anecdotal ones.

A couple weeks ago thought everyone Europe get infected winter.

Now starting think everyone get infected, also time wave reinfection March/April too. request human capital stock die stock market. complaining. even vote automatically done them. :P  Ahhh india getting 90k per day meida busy showing shit film industry!!!! Canada  community transmission  since summer sealed rest world.

Narrator: No, would not. 300k end year sounds reasonable sadly :( ride bicycle. 58,000 yesterday, dude. Bruh modern Russia anywhere comparable Nazi Germany actual fuck talking about? never said anything conspiracies idiot,. media pushing hard lockdown, anyone see that, ratings grew massively first time happened, always stain humanity can't simplest things. You’ll likely end fine. takes 3 weeks recover many respiratory illnesses. weak respiratory system along weak immune system generally takes 6-8 weeks get back normal respiratory bug. Complete lung damage everything. eventually goes away. wanted help feel better - it’s common think! also COVID back March I’m a-ok now. You’ll bounce back point! know sucks many people experience even longer least per year since forever, say experience give time try worry! *Are* masks global pandemic, objectively qualify idiot reasonable measure.   must terrifying. god mental health ramifications fresh rounds lockdowns come going impact humanity decades, say least India says Hi Shouldn’t Bannon jail? I’m surprised it’s worse.
Anyone else Remember Bethel tried raise toddler dead? Many what? 

Many people, carry usual. thought smarter this. 

If scared throw party, flock make right factual 

Yes, make wrong either. Idk think we're letting run time Don’t insult us. clocked 56,000 yesterday alone. Beat that, commute bastards! USA #1! Vaccine working well! can't summarize it? I'm fascinated graph article see it, showing average level viral load dropping time pandemic. Pretty interesting. mom thinks Gates behind virus trying lower aging population... also thinks virus overblown, Trump one save world.

I love mom think shes really stupid older age. people go movies big films like Avengers. 

You can't fully enjoy Avengers kind movie TV screen. people worst tippers also care anyone else. venn diagram basically single circle. 

That's out, shit like selfish. see make thousand dollar decisions bad info, smart  I've tipping normal, extent can. Waiting tables hard job best times, without worrying going catch deadly disease deal insane patrons get physically violent remind restaurant policies :| go, definition spike: ""an abrupt sharp increase"" also would incredibly hard lie without getting caught. 

We plenty highly intelligent good people despite shitshow white house. Someone would notice something would report media. Yeah, pets cute. people know, mini horse mini donkey. Wow stop wearing masks?? happen? India also increasing use antigen tests high false negative rates. trust number tests either. mean could pivot towards similar trade time being. take different job pandemic doesn’t mean you’ll never return career. time people thing known Taxi. ;) honestly. best friends kids school positive cases yesterday. kids class positive case home next 2 weeks everyone else keeps going in. also can't cram hundreds people tightly packed auditorium pandemic.

Expect always done. Old stay home. hard. depressing.

Trump needs release list drugs gave elderly people use treatment. Somebody really start Foundation Russians Chronic Defenestration believed beginning said human human transmission. Glad provide us factual unbiased information. Sympathy quality (or don't) within you. one needs ask feel it. Covid19 much less deadly plague was

The Black Plague novel virus pandemic, like COVID-19 pandemic! India also using lot antigen tests. article 4th August claims 30% recently saw 50% somewhere. know high false negative rates. claiming lot daily tests right sure reliable isnt feature belongs eu countries well? Absolutely, choices WFH need remain regardless. even like hybrid now. ... think weird American news company focus American news? Okay. kind sympathy anyone asking sympathy. words you’re lazy don’t really care ost truth Awesome! Thankyou, definitely check Hard swallow. authoritarianism awesome? Strongmen, turns out, good people rule. continue choose strongmen leaders. stopping spreading lies. That’s pretty obvious...  Sure clocked amount time patient needed respirator shorten it, like said people dying due access ventilator would help little, less promising hoping tho. don’t care wearing mask. Punishment complete ending cultural social activities take place indoors, unable mix groups people, misery unemployment financial strain, ending freedom travel, living climate fear. 

Given chance ventilator very, close zero, punishment completely proportion. Define “spiked” 

That word literally meaningless without numbers, it’s like CNN says cases “surge” administer unless there's compelling reason still, 500 people died US TB last year. That's 500 many.
Just one life worth it, right? Laughs hindi business like disney/movie theaters/etc survive shut long? I'm suggesting can't, override health concerns. I'm wondering earth landscape going look like finally 'beat' covid. Regal closed theaters rest year. gone theater since February certainly going time fall winter. business like survive year zero income virtually expenses? +44 look truthful accurate info Virus? roommate seems pretty anti-media info virus states blown way proportion masks anything. made post saying death rate like .002% people affected. Arnold would’ve made great president, whole natural-born citizen thing. 10min video I'm assuming summarize issues discussed.

His speech couple minutes beginning. watch yourself. rest commentary explains questions. watch well want. ten minutes, two hours. Okay what’s 70/178000.... .03%. 

I don’t problem masks, problem reactionary lockdowns draconian measures destroy businesses, opportunities, quality life, future well virus people test positive don’t even know recover days. 

How many people didn’t even know test positive? 178000 lot higher percentage even lower. Schools universities fully operating. Government asking people go cinemas pubs. Revoked permissions working home. common decency people going get service, tip. rational people know workers make money. need 12 packs toilet paper wipe fans clean? Uruguay exceptionally well. Lot's factors help: they're small, relatively wealthy generally capable political unity face crisis. really bright spot South America. hope holds.

Edit add: says 2,226 cases (640/million) 49 deaths (14/million) So, metrics, right Japan Hong Kong. rookie number Let sink it:

The virus going spread. slow down. Hard lock downs pause things. Masks may help limited situations idea avoid virus burning population beyond asinine.


Test-trace-isolate fantasy. happening unless island acted early sealed off.

Lockdowns delay things.

Masks real world far less effective talking heads admit last 100 years experts said masks mostly ineffective. April suddenly changed based nothing. nothing special Sars-Cov-2 suddenly makes masks effective. science change. thing changed experts wanted give people idea something do. placebo.

Spain, Italy, LA, Hawaii, etc show masks much all. say that? know wearing masks infected? opposite happened? Still power last time checked.  problem. virus defeated point. one glad could enjoy nice summer.

The fuckup came failing track trace system afterwards... That's still like 50x less impactful mortality age. That's good point, important distinction make. One major codicil case isn’t case March. Testing sparse March, testing probably captured 5-10% actual cases, testing probably captures 20-25% actual cases. need confirmed case numbers double March numbers represent approximately # cases. Yes, ~numbers loose ordinality correct. issues specifically agreeing on? 10min video I'm assuming summarize issues discussed. Also, would surprising? majority issues concerned largely shared likely broad enough agreement aspect issue. difference usually lays confront issue. ... ramped testing? yes headline gives wrong idea  read article. Gil Wright, Metro's Associate Medical Director Clinical Service, said state contacted city news. Dr. Wright said first shipment received November 10 enough vaccinate 1/3 first responders high risk vaccines, made Pfizer Moderna, yet approved Food Drug Administration (FDA) Dr. Wright says expected safe far, many reports side effects. be. Vitamine levels raise 1 month starting supplementation, really matter dose spaced out. don’t lock country TB already vaccine it. sauce inevitable skyrocketing? keep seeing cases stack deaths stabilize.

Again, guys said outbreaks US June, scurried away deaths spiked July. I'm playing little games. zero interest honest discussion. Portugal - schools opened 3 weeks ago, cases (and hospitalisations) spiking. Okay then, Mugello unfortunately I’m afraid like Imola Turkey unfortunately mentioned several articles. know anything vaccines know articles wrong. 

I hear reason believe false though. data sources back claim? point feels like China trolling Trump. fake news got virus. Look him, could he. Yeah. much uncertainty stress them. Herd immunity happen vaccine. saying awhile nobody wants admit it. time vaccine happens (ie widely available) virus faded background.

The ""wait vaccine"" proponents living fantasy land since started. post, literal fucking post human lives important. never right hate whole country it? European countries proving masks public space working. least Uk, seems pretty blatant saw golden opportunity help push back impending pension crisis wiping pensioners. said, hindsight makes things much clearer. Maybe really think taking best approach. all, initial response planned help Imperial, supposed experts. Seriously... every single post COVID brings hundreds vitriolic comments US Americans. guy idiot thinking Russians get critiqued harshly thread. comments quite civil. That's absolutely horrifying can't help distracted anime character picture. What's story? don’t mean sound like asshole, vaccine? vaccine come late. No. results phases 1 2 [published [some results, however, paper retracted now. Yep, discussing basics, something even elementary school children understand. People get infected die day 1. die later. Hence there's lag. simple. antigenic shift occurred. nothing situation.

Trying collectively halt social mixing prolonged period time unprecedented measure never attempted successfully history.

Dont feel bad them. raking cash paying little tax it. good gig. late. People care anymore. want life back (as people told also Reddit). want go parties everything. already it. already spreading virus much larger scale.

There's reason can't both.  Seems President must large influence world wide. government use tax dollars buy it, we'll get 'free.' free society, never try limit people's individual freedoms false guarantee temporary safety. 

So guess driver's licenses then? traffic laws general? allowing people drive passed arbitrary exam - talk limiting people's individual freedom!

You must licensing medical doctors too, right? limits people's rights attempt perform medical procedures, know nothing medicine? That's limiting personal freedom false guarantee temporary safety.

Oh goes somewhere....Covidtown! deserved free award stop asking mommy government fix everything you

Are opinion sound like rational adult say things like that? 

You not.  America _the_ worst response COVID developed world, that's entirely people yourself. Even without hospital stay long term effects internal organs mental health. Sorry sounds dense, wear masks one said concerts like two years. Masks keep respiratory droplets helps keep spread significantly. increasing adoption vaccine first months release able concerts events reduced capacity, no? 50% businesses ""essential"" stayed open. pet grooming essential? Yeah. saying China good. horrifying government. However, that's absolutely believe Beijing went work genuinely stopping spread, actually want country get ravaged virus. 

In USA government local governments get lost trying make political point ""the others"".

That's can't ignore politics. coming you, whether want not. completly flawed, least taken context, study. interviewed people joined Facebook group doe people longlasting symptoms. course would respond long lastig symptoms. also think nazi Germany example far Long covid joke either. Mate mine got hospital collapsing trying get back running. covid April/May flu symptoms hospital anything, feeling crappy since. Went try get back running September BAM! heart issue woke ICU next day. Nearly month later getting hospital. 

Scary fk super fit multiple marathons etc regular year fat sloth asthma like messed up. Hate think whats gonna happen get it... Oh, absolutely know they're saying. strongly suggest read African Grey parrot intelligence research commenting further.

Idiots saying refuse wear mask one mask threatening freedom. no, that’s better. shit certainly feels like forever. I'll wear mask want life again. Masks seem really effective now. Mandating masks helped much own. They're silver saw 75% drop new coronavirus cases state added local mask mandates, **restrictions public events closures bars, gyms, movie theaters restaurants** middle June Classic deflection. Trump never sick. thought faking illness getting better record time would help boost ratings! Thanks denial, I'm immortal! &amp;#x200B;

If may incline, I'm quite familiar situation working similar situations. terms ""didn't specify deaths covid"" would something doctor cannot disclose HIPAA. terms mortality:

[AAP's 10/1 recent updated numbers 5,435 peds cases, 66 hospitalizations, 0 deaths. evidence shed light situation given difficulties manuevering around HIPAA laws. importantly, hit something cannot agree cannot preach louder. kindness already shown, could erase child deaths related message altogether? time increasing anxiety confirmation bias, there's highly likely see literally ""2 children"" ""Covid"" trigger anxiety accident.

&amp;#x200B;

While always acknowledge priority protecting children patients important, quite easy forget caretaker caring patient. Also, forget children's parents well. situation high emotions stressful amongst many players public reasonably forgets, given many networks forget.

&amp;#x200B;

As caretaker, personally know many dealt alluded to. minority, personally know friends family members die coronavirus. son, also afraid mom dad catching coronavirus. caretaker, easy express anxiety, fear, anger project wrong person? say... yell kid? yell parents? yell nurse?

&amp;#x200B;

The higher everyone expresses emotions, higher stress becomes high stakes situation may cloud logical reasoning. body crazy thing, much Scientists Pediatricians devoted lives safeguard health, know little body altogether. complex complicated. Mental health complex complicated.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing moderator awhile hearing words ""main point doctors drastically affected covid."" Every word hits truth, idea needs propagate within public. truly important remember frontlines **humans** protecting **humans**. remember **you human** public **humans** , everyone needs remember mad first place. Take step back, see hats, see people involved.

I’m full agreement - think countries right thing permitting citizens countries high transmission rates travel there. Unfortunately US gonna take longer countries lower case rate/positivity rate/death count. Coaster Enthusiast South Dakota, visited parks pandemic, observations:
Parks enforcing masks, social distancing, cleaning, well providing hand sanitizer better major retailers, restaurants, well business western South Dakota. 
Enthusiasts know parks special willing make personal comfort sacrifices (wearing masks, longer waits, digital queues) enjoy parks.

At enthusiast event back August Holiday World indiana, masks mandatory indoors, midways. park open public, stark contrast local ""general public"" enthusiasts, most, wearing masks non required areas, social distancing non virtual queues, frequently using hand sanitizer.

What getting at, everyone goes parks complete disregard pandemic, many passionate problem taking precautions necessary means get spend day parks. senate doesnt give fuck. 1-2 years wanna move somewhere else, used anymore spreads same. immunity worse immunity infection. described possible unlikely.

Utah county residents, hand, barely started wearing masks forced to. Except economists health professionals directly opposing interests objectives situation Wow, happened reddits comments, something agressive toxic country? incredibly surprised.

Nothing said anything 'being grateful'. Two things. Schools necessary schools fucking Europe. didn’t say dying people... even though lot cases, small % dying Utah general young people. People tend kids younger ages stay state adults; median age skewed pretty young compared states high percentage deaths per case.

I still stand opinion many people selfish refusing wear masks. ... needed should. Seems like pretty big difference me. It’s new talking point pro-coronavirus crowd. find sub.

Most young accounts like one you’re responding to. Gyms high risk due people exhale, it’s quite bad going bar (literally riskiest possible place go) went gym would surprised got COVID women better maybe guidelines inadequate since women get covid die men, areas lot more.
Sure shop around site matches ideology, something everyone, useless. certainly going while, especially watch live streams. think also proves toxicity past generations. political figures old, bring immature behavior inhumane perspectives generation (racism, gender inequality views, lack human decency, political bickering) generation they’re political positions. 

If older people took time make world better place time, wouldn’t chaos today. stop putting office. Fingers crossed. something. Sure seems like it.

Can't ignore things work make case. woah. real, live knuckle-dragger! common parlance, term ""exponential growth"" implies accelerating rate increase. compounding effect. implies growth linear, important distinction, even exact details known.

So definitely say ""literally means nothing"" without knowing specific exponent - particularly general conversation. something said divide conquer strategy. Thanks speaking truth Ok nobody knew first two weeks March, realized daily case numbers started exploding northeast Yeah, that´s one glimmers hope.
We might still ""on top"" things much better case numbers around Europe suggest. Yup.

Don’t pretend go back normal unless there’s vaccine. New Zealand exception. Also China since killed/force quarantined everybody it

What’s risk going back gym limits people requires masks? Trump already upset one election. hope everyone part gets votes better President human being. even considering NYS hit 12k day, testing still abysmal compared now. lying recommended? Fall wave yet people trying say deaths down. Fucking idiots. Words matter. Particularly use adjectives. Democrats 'ban' fracking. refuse new permits it, refuse renew leasing current operations. cause fracking die period years. need know people getting tested so...

It get easier get test yet lockdown US. even know word means? able eat inside applebees ""lockdown"". sure, drive bicycle use much keep topped little basket attached handlebars. Says person convinced hospitalizations go up... also lead nation right stupidity. met mother inlaw.  critical Democrats mean support GOP

Again, never accused OP Republican. stated words direct support GOP. may environmentalist. However criticizing democrats October 2020 going deliver cleaner water forms environmental progress.

What critical Democrats October 2020 accomplish building consensus around Republican candidates. saw 2016 seeing reason can’t nice things like universal healthcare basic living wage people seem think two options status quo clearly working American citizens favor. 

Bullshit. reason things Neoliberal Republican policies Goldwater present. middle class without raging income inequality Reagan took office 1980.

They played racism various attacks progress get people vote interests.

Hillary Clinton attempted get universal healthcare 90s. nearly enough votes get passed First Lady. Obama attempted get universal coverage 2008 attempting include Public Option ACA.

However knew attempting games ""Bernie Bros"" attempted 2016.  consider ""attack left"" actual progressives supporters left wing ideology. Accelerationism whatever goal benefits billionaires hurts poor. Well, shit. sucks. Lmao Ohio largest single day increase new cases date :( GTFO Believe??? this, fairy tale??
That shit HAPPENED. Russia lot inhabitants  Dems enemy United Kingdom. chart I'm looking says July 24th USA peaked 74,885. cuff pretty good estimate. mean, think drastic drop heart attack, stroke, emergent patients visiting ER seen back March April pretty decent piece evidence deaths likely increased time. I'll agree seeing large amounts delayed care non-emergent situations killing people, that's takes time. Delayed cancer screenings deaths 2021 2022. 

The car accident example also hold much water. 2019, shy 39000 people US died car accidents. May, [NPR motor vehicle fatality rates dropped 8% - fewer cars road deaths per mile driven. Even assume 8% drop holds true year (unlikely, given traffic resumed near 2019 levels), that's still 3120 averted deaths. drop bucket comparison numbers we're looking at. [excess Alzheimer's alone make decrease car crash fatalities.  gonna lie, money would exact same. Stock food supplies hope best. Disney pretty huge diversified, streaming, production companies, IP exploit. think they'll make pandemic fine.

Movie theaters? Much shaky ground.  Many work places wont let take care kid working home. breach contract time. Sorry confusion, honest mistake.
Obviously mean 24k per million per day. went school, know population, general, demographics even geography US. would mental claim, course. However, switch, hoped clear realize talking - 8.8k per million Russia, 24k per million US, total. Simple math.

24k per million would something like 8 million per day, clearly insane. anyone else see huge correlation COVID spread tempaturre weather?? Every country southern hemisphere declining summer approaches countries northern altitudes getting much worse winter approaches?? know everyone expects worse winter terrifying first major decline cases spring/summer weather lockdowns? Won’t happen, country tired. weeks away full scale riots Maynard one right wearing black &amp; silver wig. usually dresses sort disguise promoting touring side projects. Oh figured out! must election year every country then? France 20,000 new cases day. know it’s meme also. Selfishness inherently bad thing

No, *could* fighting like hell get spread virus control protect loved ones ""selfishness"". could wearing masks go ""selfishly"" want lives go back normal sooner instead dragging endlessly. Sadly, many us *aren't* things. 

When group people instead choosing selfishly endanger health lives people, selfishness prevents rest us able safely get together loved ones return jobs, much ""us vs them"" issue people may evil, actions certainly are.  false, survey 100 questions!

That's surprising. coronavirus illnesses (colds, cat illness). chances antibody test cross-reacting? 

Perhaps “false positives” aren’t entirely false. Perhaps body generates antibodies coronavirus illness(es) &amp; CV-19 antibody test cross-reacting. antibodies. might explain asymptomatic cases. Cowpox infection make people immune smallpox... wouldn’t surprised something similar going here. Russia #1! coronavirus  successful rna vaccine would world changing, far beyond covid. nothing trump. fans wearing masks actively supports (Or supported that).

Anti masks sentiments active opposition government. remember wrote? comment. realize c0nservatives wearing masks, right?

This means saying anyone wearing masks conservative. words, existence one liberal wearing mask sufficient demolish claim. 

Here list politicians caught wearing mask. see Democrats list, meaning wrong claim.  automatically. parents special needs kids dependent school therapies most. Losing things like PT OT disaster way. Nothing said made up, must new here. lockdown, really oblivious? already decimated 68% **global** wildlife international affairs meaning international business relations. can't compared tiny ass nations much consistent need international travel US. look jealousy communist dictatorships getting right accept fact never much danger begin with. I'm torn. Part would love living country telecommuting. part likes close shopping, good restaurants, etc...

Considering shopping, restaurants, cancelled foreseeable future though... country looking better time. shit Macron lowest ratings French President history

Not currently many months though. yet likely 90% sending kids school. school 6 virtual kids. That's it. truly selfish person would realize masks also help wearer directly.

The result inferior selfishness nose-dicking. Wear mask mouth get real benefit nose uncovered prone infection without mask. bunch bullshit regulator's decision political one, contrary happened U.S in, bureaucratic process decision faster would ordinary drug. I'm sure agree this... brain reconstruct perception reality justify life choices. conscious process happening choice nuanced become resolute. TIL even comparable many truly infected March/April though. no, really control. Difference everyone getting tested. similar rates infections fraction people infected getting tested. can't compare infection rates tought high infection rates without taking account massive increase testing capacity Reddit users seem US

Most people talk solely life

So yeah healthcare experience doctor no. profoundly you, yes. learn lot internal workings hospitals emergency technician type. 

I’ve heard single person make claim did. one. Nobody died lack attention majority died directly result governors policies.

A single shift friend doesn’t extrapolate system whole.

Be honest, comment idea typical ICU 80% plus capacity given day? hospitals run seeing people travel world get treatment become doctors id say functions pretty well. New Zealand pulling anything off, go massive lockdown every time someone sick. small, spread-out, rich country that, can't forever. long term plan? 70% point appears major overestimate. Jail outbreaks [1] reach level that's absolutely worst possible environment. And, infection rates overshoot Herd Immunity threshold, overshoot may large (~2x) outbreak totally uncontrolled.

A reasonable urban environment even moderate protective measures reach herd immunity much lower levels (probably somewhere 20-40% range overshoot).

[1] Quatar migrant worker communities also reached level infection. Don’t derail. said scientifically proven Lockdowns harm good. Show science. 

I’m arguing stuff decide throw in, it’s deflection tactic. Stay point. Post proof.  good source flu ifr?

I’m arguing post. believe correct, would like ready source. 10000%.

can't 2 people lIcK frIenDs fAce sChoOl hope tell applied based news. Unless like rejection, course. Measles r value 12-18. Coronavirus around 1.1-1.3. Measles FAR contagious. really possible yet except small areas. Internet necessity situation like this. 100mbps bidirectional video meetings things. rural areas US speed. France isn’t exactly famous high hygiene standards also incredibly stupid negligent. sure number. I’ve worked lot ICU’s always run closer 75%...more flu season. vaccines work? Also, mean ""doing wrong thing?"" hold everyone standard get cold? 

This comment unhinged Earth Good thing amount people needing significantly lower that.

Whether like drugs huge step towards return normalcy coming sooner rather later. Placer county would surprised. also incredibly stupid negligent. live Hamburg, second biggest city Germany people respect rules (during day) here. never seen person weat mask metro generally people careful keep distance...

That said, also know people go parties closed doors 2 one wears mask, acting corona never existed. places town people lied contact info, since us fill track source infection. lead bartenders getting sick police losing 100s potential contacts. virus spread here.... Came say this, looks like walked runway Milan something! people comply? Let freely spread deadly disease preserve called human rights? want lose anonymity know someone certain island locked they're bragging almost one sick. like, wow, lock everyone down, postpone getting sick? Groundbreaking! what, though? sure plan something brag about. sounds like lack plan. like two doctors CA 40 years combined medical experience held press conference APRIL announce Covid less deadly flu extrapolation local % positive cases proved 15% US already deaths.

Now, especially sceptical every word comes tv website. social gathering event potential become covid hotspot think places aggresively shut tough reopen.

Personally, go NYC vacation time soon knowing ton ways get sick there, gov close everything.

Why would go NYC go Arches, UT? People take Bill Gates seriously. He's spouting subjects knows little about. He's college dropout, medical background degree warrants spending hours interview. Bill Gates wants create vaccine population control eugenics that's prevelant foundation... Hell know. problem people stopped following it. Keeping lockdown isnt realistic 10 weeks weve seen almost country go beyond it. look results? definitely significant difference based party affiliation. going deny that? fucking visor (faceshield) dumb!!! Like even acceptable wear instead proper mask, especially small ones cover bottom half mouth? Kia kaha soon thing “history”.

\-Terry Pratchett, Wee Free Men. doubt strongly. Kids mostly asymptomatic thus get tested all, even cases class. also know high viral load, even higher ICU patients thus likely spread findings UK strongly suggest schools indeed one main factors pandemic right now:

...

It's helping. I’m Middle Tennessee last Wednesday, Covid Unit beds available entire region. data shows rising infection rates.

And clear based upon en masse testing.

In many instances, worst going found testing, since many asymptomatic currently pre-symptomatic testing performed.  Kinda need national coordinated response. states really getting started Wave 1, states (kinda sorta) stabilizing, others gotten better, others looking Wave 2.

But no, let’s get every state things differently different timelines. I’m suuuuuure citizens US won’t travel states different restrictions. fully trust people actually putting time work, I'm thankful many people are. 

But definitely dont trust people institutions whose main contributions PR stunts. Traveling work travelling gather amusement park, 120 miles would allow people different counties travel meet amusement park. counties different levels other.

People traveling work though. People crossing county lines sorts things work leisure. It’s though people containing things counties. Also, don’t know familiar Southern California, trying actually identify cities counties begin end pretty difficult without map. drive one city next constantly surrounded buildings urban developments never knowing city you’re currently unless there’s kind signage map you. Also, it’s though leisure recreation businesses closed. I’ve mentioned elsewhere, attractions like San Diego zoo open operations. highly doubt folks simply coming San Diego county. anyway, lot similarities behaviors zoos amusement parks, me, one biggest discrepancies reopening plans.

Also, don’t think it’s super uncommon Southern California people cross county lines somewhat frequent basis basic things like eat out, shop, similar activities undoubtedly local turn is. Realistically, need look larger “regions” within California. Southern California basically one big “region” smaller sub regions within it. general though, pretty connected lot travel different areas within Southern California. Orange county kind situated middle lot unique experiences centralized location. already gets lot travel counties is, I’m sure you’re saying carries lot don’t think speculating “Well people probably already travel across county lines kinds things won’t make difference” surefire analysis, think pandemic justifying action “Well right done won’t make big difference too” good. Two wrongs make right. People travel far wide go amusement parks, designed attract people over. cannot say malls, restaurants, bars.

As stated paragraph, I’m sure necessarily understand travel patterns behaviors within Southern California larger region. It’s though counties act completely independent areas. fairly connected kind critique really cold given people already area. Additionally, I’ve mentioned already, given Southern California set up, certainly could people traveling across counties good distances access things like restaurants shops. Especially people nothing better do, may OK driving decent amount time simply get say Disney good enforcing rules, however saw ton videos people Disney without masks yelling medical condition won’t allow wear mask, including mom daughter combo livestreamed without masks, talking daughter felt sick got media attention back.

I would definitely appreciative links here. I’m sure kinds things happened, think key thing Disney responds. people throw fits, suspect mean get stay personally seen leaked guidelines keep referencing I’m playing Devil’s Advocate here. remember Disney guideline states said must wear mask except eating, everyone walked around hotdog hand masks, think changed rule after.

See article doesn’t explicitly mention guidelines, excludes obvious things like masks, social distancing, reservations. isn’t got information from, basically covers heard. folks gotten guidelines unions trade groups discussing things members.

Also, correct early on, Disney allowed take mask eat, later revised rule stationary eat drink without mask. mentioned, folks abusing would masks “enjoying drink“ extended periods time. I’m going say proves Disney responsible, think least demonstrates willingness change rules favor strict less convenient still opinion get everything mostly control, nothing unessential opened. LA County still purple tier within 120 miles amusement parks, people allowed travel attend.

I hate break you, we’re already passed point. Many nonessential businesses allowed operate, point it’s really theme parks large gatherings like concerts, theaters, sporting events. think one things really needs consistency. I’ve mentioned, think number discrepancies inconsistencies make hard reconcile allowed operate not. particular, failed see food events currently going Parks along operation zoos aquariums least provide evidence contrary. may disagree fact places open, reality are. consistency aunt given think Newsom isn’t careful, lot tears regulations he’s put place going receive lot scrutiny end tearing apart inconsistencies. could afford ... probably costs monthly wages. see Still help understand people vulnerable. Wait. What? Mink farms? thought China bad, Utah barbaric kids successful you. add Finland, Norway, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan Hong Kong list.

Some still cases occasional spike, they're numbers still make safe countries remain open. holy moving goalposts, batman post COVID denial subs none seem fucking clue talking about.

So norm. world Carmen San Diego seriously? wildlife returning favor add-ons. Talk percentage value... it'll help feel better. I’m hoping God they’ll least use emergency use. live Wisconsin what’s going terrifying Monday planned switch special mode take care new wave. (pun intended) smoke much  screaming magic existence solution parents work full time way homeschooling children. Go Palazzo Chigi coup think smart solution massive issue hundreds billions fix everyone's life. White House infections last week cities countries. he's another super-spreader event. dog would better ask Trump. praise NY premature all? mean that’s sad people literally dying. actual double blind study ivermectin!? feel sorry three people maybe could saved given placebo, people clamoring time. already stomach problems, I'll take non ulcer dyspepsia prevent death.  Well there's great example negativistic reification. Thats bullshit. everywhere France but, kicking off, main vectors people going work spreading around office presumably public transport.

I dont want go office pandemic. Even dont catch even get mild dose still part problem physical presence crowding people transport wherever.

I able work effectively home still come office every day.

That spread.

I think people dont think use public transport office environment. way France run. much it. elections. kidding. annoying much. idea indicated anywhere don’t know worked statements led believe that. always 80% MICU, worked. arguing statement one died Covid due resource shortages. one would carry virus slips radar.  went wrong""

That's pretty obvious every single country world.

Every?

China, New Zealand, Finland. Norway, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong.

Those countries reopened months without much issue. going spread, mean measures cannot taken keep low possible expedite containment via contact tracing isolation/quarantines.

Also, keep mind current numbers significant number people actually following guidelines via wearing masks and/or social distancing. think happen measures taken? Bernie Sanders? Hes opposite even though hes old. worthless? Gender social construct. Making men vs. Women comparison invalid. *fucked*? D'you think get virus means die 100% certain? please 😩😩😩😩 sexist shit talk here. choice partners maybe awful generalize. Disgusting. men behave like experienced maybe. insult say men like this. Lockdown last resort health capacity strained. Show one city even close strained health capacity right now.

You're forgetting testing capacity massively increased.

We know true number infections now. 100 000 per day 100 000 per day summer fraction tested. reality true number infections summer much higher that's hospitals overrun, also cause many older people infected. [Are allowed use  honestly thought top comment red superhero/supervillain outfit. really look badass, especially matching face cover.

Let’s overlook chin-diaper guy too. I’m one compared covid measles, lol. 

Disney World seems fine terms managing situation. Lol accounts replying *running* Disney’s rescue. Social Security solvent 2037 could extend 2100 (and beyond) increasing maximum tax means-testing disbursement wealthiest. rocket science fix this... fix politically unpopular wealthy people undue influence policy US. American here. Same, bro... Exact same.

Well, *that* leader country ran followers ditch. should’ve allowed drink bleach given opportunity. way, would’ve killed least. I’m fed people sharing misinformation COVID, vaccines face masks. one woman posted article Dr Mercola face masks useless Covid vaccines 

Then says “be informed” means cherry pick bogus scientifically invalid sources confirm sources. disagree you’re apart deep state don’t believe *all* person interaction huge risk? European people less stupid American people. Maybe difference (I mean, us) don’t leaders encouraging us stupid. prepared working logistics. think prepared move quickly.

I can’t imagine anyone trusting local state officials holding unapproved vaccines waiting use FDA approves. yea, hows vaccine working True. great plains.

Good news though, climate like moving north liberal politics move south. Virginia near coast blue warm. kind is. Way different culture, resources, population density/ethnicity southern central California. interests you, look State Jefferson. organization proposing southern Oregon northern California succeed current states form new one. think ever come fruition, interesting concept. assholes taking Cold War thing far ...but many Civil War. Quote proposed anything. I'm making mathematical observation. say anything else legitimately care. Italy world whatever. make difference 🤷 here. Even cabin somewhere mountains sounds pretty nice. shows absolutely idea talking about? already know outbreaks seeded large gatherings like football match conference. Theme parks similarly high risk. possible allergies mistaking colds? Great explanation positive predictive value. NYC antibody data May would much accurate say April Santa Clara Study. anyone control France? thought Europeans handling well. afraid quarantines, travel disrupted, stuck Padova borders closed sudden, closures lockdowns making experience terrible point going Padova anyway? good reasons consider. depend country moment mostly.

Are afraid getting sick dying? First, unlikely much bigger chance getting infected country moment Italy, depending are. bring virus Padova wherever are, already plenty there. border closures travel bans ridiculous. Second, unless happen taking master age 80, nothing happen unless unluck point winning reverse Euromillions lottery. Enjoy Padova.  kind thing people handwaving aside want say precautionary mandates executive measures unwarranted 99+ percent survival rate. want blow end surviving permanent damage, want blow pass illness people might end surviving permanent damage. clearly stupid understand difference science formally declaring something science simply statement every bit epidemiological evidence points away chance rule yet.

So saying assume know science going say insteadnof actually science seeing results?

Hypocritical would like claiming science rules water safe COVID, going drink water. June, way would died dehydration then.

Nope. Put straw man away honest conversation ignorant life dude. Refusing drink water way comparable wiping items know recently handled people unknown health status. One guaranteed death, nearly free precaution cause gaurenteed death.

If want conversation, take seriously knock bullshit. Stop proving wrong refusing admit it. Stop propping straw men comparing obviously incomparable responses.

Unless course dumb believe wiping items level intentionally dehydrating death nonspecific threat. case, conversation pointless believe words definitions addition believing math even pegged person wiped groceries hysteria proved right.

And yet again, fomite transmission understood, reason take precautionary steps.

Why would insist behaving intentionally dangerous manner reason behave safely? Agreed, RNA would game-changer. Especially since pandemic probably practice run next one. Yikes like numbers. America needs new coat paint catch rest world. Affordable co-working spaces hostels sure would nice. FYI US CDC 1-8 weeks death reporting deaths reported page total number deaths received coded date analysis represent deaths occurred period. Data incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. **This delay range 1 week 8 weeks more**, depending jurisdiction cause death. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

 Two trials AZD7442 enrol 6,000 adults prevention COVID-19 additional trials enrolling \~4,000 adults treatment SARS-CoV-2 infections

### US Government invest ~$486m development supply 100,000 doses acquire another one million doses

AstraZeneca’s long-acting antibody (LAAB) combination, AZD7442, advance two Phase III clinical trials 6,000 participants sites outside US due begin next weeks.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “This agreement US Government help accelerate development long-acting antibody combination potential provide immediate long-lasting effect preventing treating COVID-19 infections. evaluating LAAB combination different settings prophylaxis, outpatient treatment hospitalisation, focus helping vulnerable people.”

LAABs mimic natural antibodies potential treat prevent disease progression patients already infected virus, well given preventative intervention prior exposure virus. LAAB combination could complementary vaccines prophylactic agent, e.g. people vaccine may appropriate provide added protection high-risk populations. could also used treat people infected.

""When asked disparity, White House specific date said Trump’s priority distribute vaccine “as soon possible.” Kadlec said, without elaborating, wasn’t correct conclude meant country couldn’t see vaccine sooner January.

I'm Minnesota well 50% people masking up, that. permanent wife exactly same, UK bad numbers climbing sky high again. amount people saying masks pointless really anything, think wearing mask protect, nothing. People selfish, stubborn ultimately dumb. Who's fault? prepandimic market.

The demand PPE shot well beyond manufacturing industry could support. industry still trying adjust new demand worried inevitable drop demand pandemic clears.

Ok, discuss TB. disease problem? verify really concern developed nations. Ebola widespread covid, obviously easier contain. World governments still helping keep control, understand keep bringing up.

Reality many left city started tool them.

Also measures want nothing. 
Kythnos well them.  Dude sound disappointed prospect lol said nothing cautious prudent. thinks people ""terrified."" ""freemium"". First vaccine saves world, patent free. future products, plenty, non-free succeed permanent marketing boost first patent-free vaccine. Perfectly acceptable. can't actually serious.

Holy shit, fuck wrong sub?

Maybe spend time site while, saying sounds legitimately worrying. know well feels suffer severe depression, depression, full delusional. Chinese defector usa days made lab.

Fair, it’s October China right make claim, given evidences outbreaks part worlds traces virus Wuhan outbreak, also push backs obviously political driven, constant crazy accusations Trump Pompeo. 

The 2009 influenza first detected boy California became global pandemic. US eventually ‘traced’ back Mexico, course denied it.

And even till now, still scholars US trying pin Spanish flu China.

Before clear scientific conclusions origin, China every right make defense. There's election France 2022. Moron, 

It’s analogy. Humanity always sweeps problems rug. 

The lump problems rug starting look like mountain guess humanity trying shove rug: Climate change Covid-19. 

Every action humanity either increases chances surviving Fermi Paradox barrier decreases chances surviving Fermi Paradox barrier. one fine example humanities failure amongst ocean human failures decreases confidence we’ll survive species long run.

Sorry analogy hard understand. don’t go fuck whatever hole crawled of. word choice headline weird media’s ratings ? media’s ratings ? grow grow ?

The virus hard contain already reduced near zero. need monitor quarantine incoming travellers. China lockdown hard, maintain lockdown till 14 days community transmission. Europe/US lazy, lockdown till numbers look 'good' - still \~100 infections per day.

The thing exponential growth 100 day, grows lot faster zero. Complicated statistics conclusions draw boring, need baseless conspiracy theories keep entertained.  son still virtual school, school sent 2 notifications covid cases week alone. health department defines cases outbreak, school says there's need quarantine everyone wearing masks (except course lunchtime). masks definitely help, there's little distancing possible classrooms; many kids able space well, opened fully instead hybrid (even though health department recommends hybrid schools county). windows open, either, ventilation exactly great. 
All say, yeah, parents probably quite concerned schools right now. would helpful MIL stage 4 ovarian cancer/COPD/diabetes. hope would first line.

However worry would taking anyone else rushed vaccine. I'm sure feel honestly. Nah dude, said could manage - did. 

How NZ manage clusters? Lockdown contact tracing. That’s way it. 

It’s perception managing that’s problem. whole perception fucked. 

We aren’t US - businesses closed access subsidies covering 80% fixed costs unemployed workers 2,000$ month cover expenses.

Tell US’ support businesses &amp; unemployed, along public health care system. yet, masks highly recommended mandatory. Still local super markets 30% people wearing masks. Forum sliding technique used dis/misinfo campaigns. It’s low effort, easy causes everyone else start themselves. 

Have alt gild second joke comment watch fast discussion completely tracks. Go r/politics look many first second third joke comments awarded. dare say every thread like that. Ugly deadly hell about?

You actually believe end species, you? Wow, published ‘95. hope people heeded words somewhat. Looks interesting, I’ll check out. Thanks Yes, men assaulted husbands coworkers retail upon asked comply state mandated masking requirements leave. agree, many us care anymore, literally fatigue making us fail. many months constant attention avoiding instinctive behaviours (and 4y old's) mentally exhausted starting make mistakes.
I go work go school, can't stay home, spend whole day telling myself: touch, kiss, talk loud, walk close, share, meet, eat that, go there... counter-instinctive beginning always be, can't low guard single minute. Yesterday scratched nose mask unwashed-after-touching-money hand, last week forgot clean toy daughter used park. tired am, frequent mistakes be. 
That's covid fatigue, exists. seriously hope does, though public health benefits. flat-out like normalization one's mouth covered; like, rock pornstache people would none wiser. People observe dubious compliance orthodontic regimen worry errant spray spit slapping someone face. one better things come 2020 far. It’s like sort epidemic something! wrong wrong matter are. like bellend bellend. know, kind limp dick statement that? Call fucking spade spade. Sweden scandinavian country men power. We’ll hit 400k next year. every state like FL. Midwest get ravaged it’s bad Detroit, Portland Seattle.

AZ, TX, CA FL hit bad summer haven’t heard recent big spikes states. also doesn’t get cold locations Winter shouldn’t detrimental effect. said anything dooms day scams? see proof reef “totally fine” years bleaching event. Basic biochem geology don’t explain back claims. seen ghost reefs bleaching event even 3 years later back normal. dead reef great place see fish.
Show scientific papers back claims Absolutely.
Victorians deserve meal beer pub hopefully that's around corner.
Been tough Vic friends family.
But yes they've definitely put hard yards rest us. happen know percentage 95% don’t severe symptoms? told brewer's lung hoax? total number deaths scenario case isolation, household quarantine, social distancing 70s 260 000, whereas place closures included total number 350 000... interventions lifted, still large population susceptible substantial number people infected. leads second wave infections result deaths, later. lockdowns would lead repeating series waves infection **unless herd immunity achieved vaccination, considered model.** 

Kind big thing consider, albeit understand reasons (ex. requiring haphazard speculation efficacy hypothetical vaccine). **Also big thing model account asymptomatic spread huge reason people advocate place closures.**

The journal headline based inference Figure 1 red curve versus green curve. However, asymptomatic spreading, would contend case isolation (CI) household quarantine (HQ) interventions undermined, realistic comparison might look like ""Do Nothing"" (purple curve) versus ""Place Closures (PC)"" (orange curve), demonstrates absolutely noticeable benefit closing schools public spaces.

This needs rerun place closures social distancing 70 year olds (PC\_SDOL70) social distancing 70 year olds (SDOL70) give us better insight. Maybe mountains Peru? Time apply sweet research grant money! Well already saw sub argument maskless would make people ""uncomfortable"" Sweden getting fucked hard. deaths country soon mark words listened scientist whole time? Hmm trump never stopped China coming USA? don’t think White House scientist payroll? love many people say could done better know? pandemic new everyone! Quit criticizing issue appointed voted officials go vote maybe run senator, governor even president. one know get rid pandemic it’s making worse play blame game! Maybe instead blaming trump everything dems could try help instead point fingers! reality time waste blaming trump less time spending actually fixing problem! person covid goes quarantine goes around infecting people criminal negligence? guess rules dont apply loser. also neurological (including cognitive emotional) manifestations. Could stress, dex, hypoxia, completely detached reality now. mean, even detached usual--as in, psychotically detached. Someone woke hospital asking, ""where I?"" said ""In covid ward."" said ""that's possible, honest many mask mandates. people businesses right thing wearing one called ""the epicenter world"" Doug Ducey governor pretty lazy whole issue I'm glad people right thing story decided get Full Face Respirator. 

For stuff like flu would use half face one, COVID Ebola I’m definitely going 3m 6800 FF-400. Lol comment removed “in civility” automod. joke. parts apparently civil won’t removed:

Agreed.

Discussions relevant COVID include various governments handling pandemic response. isn’t “political” discuss politics role subject subreddit.

I get intent someone living US - could rip response leaders every comment. It’s true! it’s least refreshing discuss COVID without EVERY comment becoming argument politicians a) incompetent b) negligently incompetent. Nobel Peace price bad joke. like title. like Japan choice either. Young people total fucking asshats go figure. People lesser intelligence feel smarter engaging conspiracy theories.

Most events conspiracies based easily explained understood. Conspiracy theories offer simple explanation understand. case cognitive bias. look information supports conspiracy. course, internet allows spread people talk it, people believe it. Isn’t CFR also countries finishing winter? would suggest it’s weather either...? Actually, virus multiple mutations already - looking genetic code virus region, scientist trace came. 

As understand it, mutations haven’t made virus weaker stronger / dangerous significant level use mutations way tracking origins. J'allais le dire. mostly countries imo wrong. Trusting mental capabilities citizens. Inform them, explain right use force. work drunk driving, smoking tried approach. failed less like always human biggest danger humans. confused. cannot burn unless conditions perfect let much fuel build up. Aboriginals would burn year round east coast forests. takes 5 - 10 years unburnt forest develop dangerous fuel levels. unless burn 15% per year create inevible disaster. currently burn less 1% fire prone eastern states. land drought flooding rain rest. think reducing CO2 stop gum trees burning need use brain think obviously faulty logic. mean... since leaving Microsoft he's philanthropist who's spent time dealing public health issues. Specifically prevention treatment infectious diseases developing countries, helped found Coalition Epidemic Preparedness Innovations years ago. 


And like he's saying controversial. look Europe. lack info typically means don;t want BAD info made public long possible, why? Makes sense issue updates every day 2 really reason Christie BAD shape likely got trump Amen.. I'm religious sounds like read gospel. things proven work scientists countries. 

I’ve argued along anti-mask protestors ones screaming shouldn’t shut businesses. Yet would wear mask places could open sooner stay open longer. 

They stupid understand.

It’s “freedom” damnit isn’t.

For entire lives they’ve worn shirt shoes McDonald’s without complaint. point control cases serious control cases mild know sure works People stopped going hospital heart attacks first couple months lockdowns, people could survived didn't. go, afraid go. Well don’t know analogy work similarly person multiple medical issues, doctors always treat what’s concerning issue first work way list. flying fuck would wear mask effective vaccine released available? “experts” need fuck off. I'm sorry realize one allowed respond stupid question aside OP.  People believe hit them. Busch Gardens couple weeks ago. wasn’t packed lines still 30 minutes big roller coasters. Masks strictly enforced took steps social distance riders. helps get surgical/hospital mask wear imo...much breathable cloth. another well known public official, tweet every 2 hours, would assume worse. "" literally Cartman ""

Wow...that amazing. actual cartoon characters come life Reddit? Realistically speaking, *no*; can't. I'm sure *both* sides would agree this. 

Broadway unique among businesses takes *lots* time (several months) prepare show, whatnot. much easier cancel shows magically start holding again. such, it'll probably one *last* businesses reopen - certainly 2021, quite possibly even 2022! Um glad outgrew mybdisney phase 8... fucking get it.  It’s concerning information released. think good news would reported. Well Trump jealous China’s ability suppress censor messaging deemed subversive single-party totalitarian state. near-total control every media platform citizen’s agency ways wishes could here. Like Trump dismantle subvert infrastructure place bury covid reporting, lot reporting still left hands states different things depending tons variables. China’s infrastructure didn’t need dismantled cover things installed able first place, don’t contend pesky second parties toeing line. Victoria lockdown 7 months keep rest Australia safe contributed lot states maintaining semblance quality life. laugh, ignorance arrogance make deadly combination west, case post covid. I’m trusting CDC it’s scientific community. thing science there’s never 100% accuracy. Hypothesis constantly re-Evaluated, thus science constantly changing. Theories hypotheses duplicated multiple times giving similar results, still considered 100% accurate. Hence different form stories. People. People went wrong. Thots pears. people realize close quarters always, sick mean they're going leave unattended 24/7? Lmao live swamp. makes tough. Thank good luck thought worst case scenario 2 million? 75% drop COVID-19 cases **closures** March April 2022 maybe. Next year already fucked. Time embrace reality. accuse bot easily. proof Swedes right. Jackhammer solutions like total lockdowns decreasing return every time implemented anew Lol ok I've weeks ago, literally nobody cares there. People said would overwhelm every hospital June. yeah, we're done listening. Remember fauci said would 100-200k deaths, happened? say ""We know went wrong: French people!"" see beat :) Hong Kong special administrative region, direct control Beijing. get that. say fact whole country actually badly. Would interested seeing impact overall deaths. E.g clear hospital beds faster still opens resources cases. Yes, magical vaccine going come save us all... unless trump re-elected. it’ll rushed taken seriously. 

Unless vaccine like POLIO GOOD, 2021 going worse year. former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie spends sixth day hospital treated COVID-19, current Gov. Phil Murphy said Thursday predecessor ""the quintessential Jersey exact condition remains unknown it’s still unclear course treatment he’s receiving. 58-year-old hasn’t tweeted since Saturday, doctors, family, friends made public announcements he’s doing. We’ll hit 400k eventually first months 2021. We’ll vaccine take time it’s widely distributed. Well, mask guidelines law? I'd pretty pissed guidelines came sunglasses transgender hormones police took upon enforce gun point.

Are LAWS enforced?

He can't actually tell local governments can't pass regulations. local Assembly want so, can. interpretation events concerning. guess. Social Life since end february- march non existing Restaurant (of course sat outside). younger folks made Partys parks. know changed guess it. Alcohol time restricted parts, police enforce it. (for city) drink think 22 clock outside Bars (i think so)


Awful decision want share: know maybe oktoberfest. canceled. highly intelligent people made instead bar/Restaurant oktoberfest. Parts indoor. musicians. Yay mean he's completely recovered he's longer contagious longer virus. appearances tell us either feeling better enough make appearances, pretending feel better enough make (there seems weird propaganda angle too).

Edit add - mean he's completely recovered he's longer contagious longer virus. appearances tell us either feeling better enough make appearances, wants lead people believe healthy enough make (there seems weird propaganda angle too*). release hospital establish he's better either - suspect aside experimental treatments left medical advice, doctors allowed hospital WH combination VIP syndrome simping. don’t think afford shutting entire country again. Instead that, choose work certain high risk regions. 

Similarly NYC, certain high risk neighborhood regions shut instead entire city. Study basic biochem geology. Ice age CO2 drought. CO2 800ppm 20 million years ago C3 photosynthesis rate limited level. Corals grow location earth clear warm water. coral reefs get bleached every single time la Nina, yet still get bleached next time. Stop gullible believing doomsday scams. Claiming 'The science settled' direct violation falsification, basis modern science. charlatans claim. CEO one head much need remove already know that? anybody thinks 2021 going better delusional using common sense. Yes people suffering quarantine fatigue enter winter months suspect seasonal affective disorder making people depressed contribute less social distancing. Worse, people hang indoors weather. Oh boy sadly Yes, kind help come expect people trained watching post-game shows ESPN.  non American point view, would believed possibility 215,000 deaths less 8 months many people thinking big thing. Little understand kill you. likely infected selfish customer weeks ago still breathing issues, minor lung damage. I'm 30, sure require hospitalization ventilator can't fucking walk stairs. Avoid crowds wear damn masks. 50% correct. They’re either hiding hiding. knows 🤷‍♂️ Cockroach people, they’ll survive anything Whoever made call CDC, opinion, screwed us rest pandemic. Beyond lives lost rampant spread occurred, country massively hard time trusting science government agencies. choosing lie us beginning, crazy people fodder conspiracy theories. Hell, even I’m weary trust again. horrible, gross thing people. Whoever’s decision fired. Transparency builds trust. use? seriously. longer Broadway remains closed, less likely roar back eventually. possible going find alternatives Broadway dust settles, part ""new normal"". 

We're going back ""old normal"", remember? Broadway going *one* things probably returning figure rebuild society. Others include brunch, in-person school, packed stadiums. Like may, need find alternative approaches less risky, prevent future pandemics. new normal, come on. Yawn, beds. IDK bullshit measure still 9 months.

For Covid19 patients, caretakers need get full PPE many times day.

That's limit. bad job. doubt accountability though.

Cast first stone, much? idea info accurate predictions three four months ago far less info now. This. think also allowing buffer time allow casts rehearse whatnot reopening. I’d imagine won’t quite easy reopen businesses. Test less numbers look better! /s
Deaths likely attributed causes stroke, heart attack, pneumonia, etc... Time tea love waffle house. don’t take time alter original comment? Instead bury “my bad” thread one see it. point still sticks out. lie Home Depot donating trump continues. ok, 8 months adds debate?? No, saying all. Let's say India 20% China that's 1%, averages out. dad interacted someone turned COVID positive work days ago. workplace said count exposure 10 min, 15, even though COVID positive person wearing mask. thought determining exposure based dad's recollection 10 min rather 15 good idea. mean, 5 minutes short period time. would easy get amount time spent wrong 5 min, especially asked days fact. workplace insists he's exposed keep coming in. mom think self-isolate, set guest room guest bathroom yesterday, brought dinner tray eat guest room. He's mad thinks ridiculous, think reasonable 14 days exposure. mean ridiculous? something else doing? He's pretty irritated says spend weekend guest room. anyone think better way forward? tell Trump, he'll make sure we're back winning. United States: Oh now!!  “Embargo won’t work China worlds biggest buyer world debt. countries threaten level China threatens call back trillions debt owed several countries.”

^^^ right there. Yes. 

The Black Plague infected killed large proportion world, like COVID-19 pandemic will. Black Plague resulted artistic drought, like COVID-19 pandemic will. Black Plague created ""new normal"", like COVID-19 pandemic will. 

And *how*, may ask, *bad* thing? guess that's happens freedom belief &amp; expression allowed first amendment rather compromising greater good everyone around them. shows like? think reprehensible Americans decided ok allow another 200k people die think waiting rigged election unlikely inauguration Biden acceptable solution getting real response pandemic.  first 211k Trump administration rest us every single last one 200k people die vain Biden win.  Even unlikely scenario Trump able take country take Biden administration several months develop pandemic response thousands upon thousands die people interested protecting Constitution failed us every single step way since Trump took office actually protecting people. fall window covid, count covid death Really depends age distribution. remember reading India IFR like 0.2 % even less, much plausible considering small proportion people 60+ 70+ compared western countries. western nations early serological studies showed 0.5 1 %, bit hospitals overflowing. all, 0.15 % IFR get estimate seems bit low, would probably line adjusting unreported deaths. Church best place ‘healed’ get virus. 

You praise lord, doctors all. wondering - lockdown fatigue? look US understand happens ignore virus pretend “it doesn’t exist” “it’s gone now”. Disclaimer. Bill Gates' payroll value life well. told one death would equate 100 people put extreme poverty, would worth saving life? It’s interesting cost benefit analysis. run analysis seasonal flu (yes know covid dangerous), seasonal flu kills tens thousands people year - even vaccine - yet don’t shut flu. ran cost benefit analysis decided shutdowns weren’t worth saving lives. It’s gray area sliding scale. guess Corona ate redditors well is? 

National positivity rate US around 5 Czechia 20 percent right now. It’s unbelievable much people buy hype headlines. “Omg Lowes paying bonuses Home Depot must evil company I’ll never shop again.” Lol, one article mind radically altered. wonder world set number brain cells population increases get increasingly spread out. future? go movies watch new movies home demand?

Some theaters might open worst pandemic with, many. high, single-day cases, mostly cases previous two days. increase daily averages:

week 38 - 300/day

week 39 - 400/day

week 40 - 500/day

week 41 - far reports 4 days 650/day Next week 10k cases appear normal Europe. Guess rushed vaccine didn’t trick? notable thing Covid deaths Russia also approaching April peaks.

Most European countries US record numbers, much less daily deaths first wave. Sounds like badass prime minister. Lockdown probably happen without saying it, situation gets bad. Thanks, that's needed. looks even overexponential worldometer, R0 even increases. That's limited testing capacity able detect. office still running positive covid sales department (bc closest contact first case) given option work home.

Protip- Sales every company’s favorite department put /s people embraced Brave BAT, something similar. Directly contributing quality without costing person much personal wealth, easy, sound impossible.

We collectively need better monetization ideas, porn.

Paying 50$ good quality ethic video something people willing do.

But I'm sure come good solution. 50 years WW7. vaccine fail

Care corroborate claim? Phase 3 finished yet, conclusion drawn yet, unless clairvoyant. person shopping week Aldi. 2 months ago, started seeing maskless shoppers, quit going there.

Other Aldi, months
, businesses.

We free pickup Walmart, done instacart Aldi once.

Lack enforcement mask rules drives customer away, guess math think make money catering Trumpanzees. actually right track opened phase one phase 2 soon. bumped staggered openings 4 weeks would substantially better shape. easy say now, data time opening trending looking great. issue lag reporting test results especially deaths allowed decisions made insufficient data. What’s china shills whatabouting US? usual suspects would suddenly trust experts. AFAIR 25% positives show later positive serology, might wrong. Also, 750m infected 1m dead means 0.13% mortality, current estimates. also core electorate. remember time said measures two weeks A? wondered could expect get even reasonably accurate numbers Russia... sure negative.

Reducing person's suffering reducing demand health care shortened recovery (10 vs 15 days) good thing.

Death worst case outcome, thing trying avoid. thought Russia sort vaccine??? seem working tho 12,000. I'm concerned ones lying it’s reported 1 7 people experiencing side effects

Why quote contents?

*The side effects noticed volunteers found milder side. medical experts call vaccine's 'reactogenic' effects post administration, tend cause mild discomfort. symptoms witnessed include fever, chills, muscle pain soreness.*

In words - common side-effects many vaccines. Anyway next ten years crucial. need get 2030 alive. thinking next 300 thousand years may difficult well... Right. keep complaining measures people attempting take make idiots acting like nothing going on. anything complain would cooperate short period time help tone things down. 

They would get economy back faster That's good way it. way beyond skill set average lab, however, carries lot risks terms data security backups.

Contemplating risks two approaches, think arguably safer productive use Excel small database jobs require lot data manipulation querying. courses action downsides. 1k day much considering population density actually held people accountable putting others danger could saved 211k died.  absolutely 100% attacked behavior. Yes, sheep. Again, Bill Gates financial stake COVID-19 vaccine developed. investments Gates Foundation's Strategic Investment Fund. Returns redirected fund, Gates' back pocket, used investments. There's dividend Gates. 

Sorry fell conspiracy theory propaganda. designed fool gullible people like lazy look things smart enough understand reading. 37 cities America population 500k more, Atlanta, Georgia smallest 507K.

My definition narrow includes majority southern central states.

People 20 60 miles Cincinnati downtown going far exposed Covid people Wyoming KY TN. many people areas regularly travel back forth urban areas, exposed, bring back. also know people live urban area.

The vast majority rural areas, including grew KY, exposure know number people urban areas.

You seem awfully defensive, reality grow truly rural area close Cincinnati.  Maybe people acted country country values, close benefits urban areas, including jobs hospitals, different position people truly rural areas.

I grew area KY 125 miles nearest large city, Louisville. country. one went Louisville daily work, hit restaurant show, routine medical stuff, activities expose people Covid. home county zero Covid deaths. highly unlikely anyone home county knows someone knows someone died, unless family NYC.  also required come waiting test results unless fever.

This violation guidance. Anyone close contact 6 needs quarantine. People wearing masks. statewide mandate so. Everywhere go, everyone wearing mask. 

So think people would smart move state 45th nation comes actual COVID deaths per capita, northeast 5 states top ten deaths per capita? Reddit shits America literally constantly. Fuck Russia. I'm arguing either way necessarily, presume measles outbreak distancing masks? mean truth think it... Stress dominant factor weakening immune systems. listen news wear mask buy hype probably less risk catching it. work fat, good shape regularly exercising, supplementing eating right foods yeah. Ever Asia? People wear masks everywhere virus. Pretty sure Gates Foundation also helping drive this. I'm also pretty sure part Billions give away help offset cost. people go infect others like person replying to.  rights end another person's begins. Wow Russia....that's one way win prizes guess.... course will. Scientists analyze data understand real scale future. Russia release half baked vaccine ago? how's going? Title misleading. Russia's highest single day record, international.

UK broken 20k+ days ago! course must focus Russia... Fuck off, 'independent' arse. US Politicians don’t manufacturing companies. don’t can’t move them.

They add tariffs goods China try embargo problem. Higher costs get pushed onto consumers China doesn’t get hurt. Embargo won’t work China worlds biggest buyer world debt. countries threaten level China threatens call back trillions debt owed several countries.

Also China builds many factories companies pay build stuff. Many companies , like close 70%, don’t factories stuff built in.

Many regions people propose move chinas manufacturing either don’t infrastructure support level export needed unwilling build factories one country money build factories.

It’s hard company say I’m going pull China move India wherever factories already make goods extra bandwidth take additional work.

It took 20 years China become kind manufacturing power house. Many countries started journey compete it’s going take while.  10% planet infected, means IFR 0.14%.  bit higher, really, since guaranteed plenty unreported deaths. could say gave people quite reality Czech Cool original post still edit it? yeah, see unfair taking away giving someone else ... Obama must them.

/s look crazy high positivity rates test. Imagine ignoring harm done lockdowns. USSR ran dictatorial command economy rich oligarchy everything regular people nothing, far communism get.

I'd argue communist state never existed extended period time. 

And ones name dropped soon violent revolutions ended even tried turmoil. SOVIET RUSSIA CORONA SMASHES YOU! use RemindMe Bot, get back me.

You sound 14 years old. I'm digging style. Yeah, right, that's March, everyone.
Current state affairs Military personnel RKI scientists available hotspot counties trace contacts decide countermeasures, starting 35/100k/week.
- masking limiting parties law 50/100k/week, 10 days trial period, restrictions.
- Schutzhaft high-risk groups, protection much possible. New rapid tests prioritized care homes hospitals. happening here(the US), too. Dead bodies tested means deciding staff exosed virus, default. reminds need look eventually happened backlog suspected covid deaths area. I'm sure ever added numbers. number usa deaths you’re saying Trump responsible gravely ill head security say trump responsible for.  According UN Sweden best healthcare world, impossible decisions based science. busy trying fight fires country care started fire first place. 10% Population reduction. Achievement Unlocked Bill! fraternity parties?/s Kinda like Joint Chiefs Staff quarantined, microcosm. seems value different things. Personally, economy tanks shut down, cost saving thousands lives, seems worth it. 

Also, countries succeeded this, all, I’m disappointed country honestly. Yes, that's lot, screwed. accelerating, galloping. Extra! Extra! Trump dumb liar! $200k+ I’ve seen people UK social distancing wearing masks. Seen countless videos packed pubs nightclubs. Also travel restricted. go Ibiza thousands people bring home virus. Can’t blame everything schools. hooray PUTIN. remember Australia US wanted investigate China origin virus, excluding every country possibility lead spat China Australia. China agreed countries part investigation possible origin virus. What?! implying US media outlets lie complicit US efforts manufacture consent?? Russia bad. MSNBC good. hail Bill Gates world leading epidemiologist virologist Good know? give Regen treat W Reed too? f*ckin r£tards still won’t believe madlads posting real news COVID affects everyone differently. trump access finest medical treatment world. statistically likely would recover this. 

Also, life unfair sometimes. many wonderful people died virus. Yet someone dangerous heartless like trump recovers. wish explanation too. Trump seems invincible. He’s cheated way life, successfully. old, poor diet lifestyle (drug use) worlds stressful job yet heart still pumping. feeling dude live 100.

I don’t really get people think it’s fake. Like yeah, they’re capable that, lie time. political advantage. COVID diagnosis far hurt Trumps campaign. Unless long term con here, like trumps already decided he’s going resign election, wants use COVID excuse look like he’s heroically stepping battling horrible infection. don’t buy yet. Place bets! You’re nut job lmao. New world order. Yeah foreign tourists go Sydney maybe places like Great Barrier Reef, Uluru Melbourne.

Yep parts Australia get snow there’s massive amounts suburbs people would shoveling regular basis. There’s houses enough really cause huge effect national scale. evidence that?

Does working, getting educated wanting see people closest sake sanity class “unsafe behaviour” you?

The people responsible intense restrictions governments impose people supporting them. 😱

""No must go lives protecting vulnerable!""

Instead went lives forgot young people work side side vulnerable every single day.

The way protect spread disease first place. Imagine that. no, U.S. much higher death rate per capita. makeup extra heavy looking pale day *needs* **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**. Hopefully Biden/Harris make happen.

In many ways doesn’t go far enough however, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks — something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people “enemies” progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society — good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm. Individuals allowed hoard cash. progressive tax policy course help redistributed, aid less fortunate. cash hoarding outlawed, banks reason exist. probably done away first. People run banks identified enemies state placed camps see error ways returned society. course allowed enter advantageous position, somewhere near base, reduced manual tasks help greater good. Needless say also special insignia masks identifies part dangerous class individuals.

Business owners stripes receive treatment managers banks. course understanding welcome opportunity make amends society. However will, protection, removed society.

There measures taken vis-a-vis bourgeoisie brought much pain unto country. tackled later.

**The important thing 100% fucking law leave house without wearing mask.**

Frankly require wearing even home even you’re alone. simply strictly outlawed public. Anybody caught flaunting important rule dealt harshly. Penalties enough. Imprisonment, indefinite period (at least year, five even ten years) first time offenders. exceptions, appeals. Second-time offenders sent top secret camps permanently. camps degenerates repeat violators laws. security reasons limits small group security professionals special clearance. Red Cross international organizations allowed anywhere near premises. make sure harmful individuals kept sight mind. fair, correct, proper measures taken people willfully go public without masks. Look data again. shows majority infections *don’t know* happened.

Only known traces, majority infections home work.

It’s responsibility public health agencies adequately explain make accessible information, data evidence supports calls action. responsibility public accept say fact would incredibly irresponsible so. demonize people choose use logic science? 

There isn’t enough data accessible public. example, *you* even prove covid real without deferring another persons interpretation data worst happen

""In culture mourning communal — tradition wakes average last two days — able properly grieve died deeply affected tribal members, Mr. Ben said."" blog nice presentation graphs. I'd reckon made guess based pre-clinical tests monkeys phase 1/2 data.

IDK reliable data reinfections.

One Israel's health insurance providers claims seen around 30 cases people testing positive again. exposure fully random, 90% long-term immunity, 5 now.
Like every virus disease, flare-ups chronic cases, rare false-positives, many false-negatives, PCR tests sometimes detect small infection defeated immune system.
But importantly, exposure random.

I'd guess first-generation muscle-injected RNA vaccines protecting people severe disease, prevent infectiousness.
Perhaps they'll reduce aerosol infections second phase disease, look like anything fomite transmission, virus still replicated animals' noses throats. I'm sure news watch, pretty much every single country Europe new shutdowns new record daily infections. Republican run states. live MN Gov Walz fighting Republican run state senate continue enforcing mask mandate various restrictions.

Outside that? Nah, he's gonna go away anything. It'd look bad Republicans, he's got protection now. Dems fucking spineless anything real. Contrary administration says, U.S.'s Covid-19 problem China's fault. ours. Trump seems insist people take masks sees them.  Sure, thousands reinfections USA (even fully confirmed lab testing) suppose would surfaced. yet conservatives upset TIME cover lol. wonder put block much reality. meanwhile Ontario 14.5 million people, we're freaking 700 new cases per day 48,000 tests. wrong god damn country?

Again, claim people traveling kinds things time, across county lines leisure. zero proof that. speculation. cannot quantify exactly many people crossing county lines leisure tracked. Opening theme park obviously draw people over, unlike restaurant, bar, movie theater, etc exist almost every community. 

Your response regurgitates point people crossing county lines constantly kinds things, leisure major reason among them. Nobody know Los Angeles currently travelling across county lines leisure. Everyone know keeping small circle family close friends, work, grocery store. Contrary believe, majority people taking seriously right now, still mostly keeping home/communities, outside work. 

Again, think outdoor activities strict mask enforcement allowed extent, masks strictly enforced, another question state resources ensure theme parks continuously enforcing rule? major inconsistencies reopenings, think indoor malls recently got ok reopen 25% capacity something makes little sense me, see good reasons theme parks open right without contrasting things allowed open similar worse transmissibility. bets would 2022 shows return I'm guessing Broadway League knows well, keep setting dates far road people retain hope. gut feeling unless there's vaccine miracle gets majority general public *well before* May 30, 2021, there's realistic way shows occur then.

It’s mandates serious populous enforcement agents enact it. serious make mandates well possible repercussions might face breaking rules effective become.

For example, Tennessee COVID cases New York State despite NYC higher population whole state Tennessee. Differences readily transparent two states. effective masks protocol leader taking seriously trying keep numbers down. 

Masks simply part, important part every individual fully control own, preventative measures others also take effect order country world get past this. state part well making sure rules put place actually get followed.

As example, NYC pulled liquor licenses businesses caught going rules.

Also countries they’re ones effective. Singapore jail people social distancing revoked work visas people caught obeying rules. They’re probably Western richest country Asia.

Here’s people fined, penalized done them. That's situation every latín american country almost. Long lockdown fucks economy, fucking economy means might anything eat end day. Also, goverments extremely corrupt care that. They'd barely buy new ventilators.

I know get downvoted lot, seeing pandemic evolving Latin American, Brazil might end right approach context.

EDIT: Thanks clarification NY It’s depressing. attack every misstep end solution. Science teaches us it’s OK change opinions new data becomes available. cannot fathom people ignore facts doesn’t conform worldview.

Sorry, trump call dems newest hoax? play pandemic saying like flu would gone like miracle? acting like covid big deal? NSA down! post??  intelligence, vibes... you’re choosing weird hill die on. Yeah that's true, hands tied. can't keep quoting they're independent impartial scientific body, time concede mercy decisions coming Beijing. 

For example, pressure China lead delay confirming person-to-person transmission, declaring pandemic? think important us know role, any, politics play early missteps. We’ll tell need know break.. shit. said anything outside enemies?

A weak country easy plunder riches '- covid bad things ground Argentina right now?

We see numbers, seem like several-fold undercounts categories delayed knows much, see much actual reporting happening reality real time. 

If bet, Argentina already 0.1% real PFR (though 0.3%). peace mind get tested.

But stand statement. Mucus production (runny nose, productive cough) really typical Covid. Explosive diarrhea (my spell check loved term) also common. still million nasty bugs running around.

[Here's ,a link authoritative bottom 4. you’re producing mucus, it’s likely allergies cold flu symptoms, COVID-19 infection. Rajani said runny nose mucus typically clear allergy sufferers. Yellow green-colored mucus likely points viral condition, flu. Rajani cautioned people jump “There viruses besides flu around – parainfluenza, rhinovirus, enterovirus – jump conclusions, take appropriate action,” Rajani said. “Wear mask symptoms evaluated.” who's data say, Worldometer report say US?

But yeah got bacterial pneumonia right influenza. Would recommend. MS became seventh state join 1,000 deaths per million club days ago. DC nearly 900. that, there's bit gap. states sitting 700 already getting another wave (looking possible IL, MI, etc.), they'll get 1,000 too. Similar states much higher numbers spring, large airport. Surrounding states setting record cases hospitalizations. I'm okay keep taking precautions. would known sooner... wonder take get rest country wear masks? Seriously.

How much compliance need demonstrate significant effects course region/county/state/country's case curve?Because post title asserts AZ's cases decreased masks mandated. much compliance really think going Arizona? 

So masks cause correlation, prove states countries observing thing? (to rest world, state comparable country anyway) demonstrate material difference places mandates vs. (and high compliance)? masks impact hospitalizations area well? assess degree compliance? Whether mask mandate implemented not? Well clearly we've established people often times flout mandates even fines attached abiding them, lot law enforcement even enforce stuff like state mandates USA least. clearly happening parts world well, considering linked quoted Spain France earlier. [redacted cuz mods] loses, I’m pretty sure turn anti-maskers you’ll see penalties increase jail time.

Once ignores fact non-compliance questionable guidelines prevalent thing countries, unless think event taking place would spur countries jailing comply. 34 last count ? all.

It grave mistake looking binary question. 

That immunity works.

People generate antibodies fight infection. antibodies still there, immunity. antibodies disappear, gradual process, lose immunity.

The important question whether immunity 4 months, important question whether immunity many years future. available evidence. points unequivocally direction immunity lasting much year, two most. 

Which functionally equivalent immunity, plan world ending 12 months now, we, thus everyone else gravely concerned talking ""no lasting immunity"". ""no immunity even week recovery""

Then question immunity last molecular level, enormous implications prospects various vaccines development. lots scenarios -- optimistic one vaccines able better natural infection. may also able that. current Covid death count include tons deaths existing conditions exacerbated Covid. vast majority death certificates Covid major preexisting conditions, [...]

This also true flu. fact, like COVID-19, vast majority flu-related deaths deaths flu considered primary cause death. Except already 10K verified deaths already COVID deemed primary cause comorbidities physicians whereas flu number much closer 0. know true based life experience - people die flu rarely die *just flu.* *almost always* comorbidities involved flu-related counted Covid deaths way flu never been. 

No. Doctors make best judgment cases they, best medical judgment, consider influenza one causes death, write cause death. Likewise COVID. would think sudden started counting deaths due viral illnesses half Covid deaths nursing facilities example. 

Again, think figure Influenza? guarantee it’s higher percentage two systems comparable, Covid testing constant flu not. 

They certainly comparable. don’t even know could say aren’t, lol. Flu “constant,” well, whatever mean that. Doctors constantly checking both. many flu tests administered compared covid tests, comes deaths, yes term “constancy,” whatever mean that, particularly two share symptoms. Testing flu lets (somewhat) rule COVID get positive central database Covid used states, flu system infrequently used. 

This false, would think flu system infrequently used, doesn’t cover states? gets data every week like COVID system flu reporting take years, Covid takes days. Etc. 

No, flu *estimation* take years *yearly* statistic depends on, said previous comment, lot data. flu reporting takes around time COVID. easy make case flu vastly estimated exacerbating cause death (where extra heart attacks come winter?) flu estimated.

It really, really, really seem intent making flu something minimal, despite long established CDC reporting, Covid seem major. I’m sure good use stats valid argument

And I’m really intent it. I’d say opposite true, you’re intent making COVID another flu strain, since word public health officials considers virus much deadly flu, yet you’re arguing differently.  went cdc website, *BASIC ASS MATH,* made graph. read 500 comments graph listened criticism educated more. going facts tell me. sincerely doubt it. Though maybe form filled except date White House gets experimental drugs. needs federal law mandating masks right fucking now. Hopefully Biden/Harris make happen.

I thinking earlier; wishful thinking friend. I'm sure authority Feds issue order, even did, basically unenforceable. 

If Dems control Congress Presidency might able get states issue mask orders exchange Federal funding, similar drinking age highway funding. state level much enforceable, local law enforcement wants cooperate. I'm California, example, law enforcement said pretty much enforce mask ordinances. I'm still alive, cares! mask!

Mask mandate done shit town Wisconsin. 50% customers station wear them. even cop come explicitly state would enforce it. county among fastest rising state state among fastest rising country.

Current death rates absolutely disastrous. woman left looks stylish fuck tho... Agreed, everyone meme'ing america numbers. honestly people probably pity people take seriously lives ruined pandemic. hard feel compassion media shows braindead goverment officials civillians take seriously all. gullible.

Trump helm, trying silence move away CDC, calling covid fake, ignoring safety measures inciting ppl same, silencing Fauci etc etc etc.

So gullible. Nah, I'd expect actually read article, thoughtful response able argue effectively. Sorry, realize ego fragile required good, long stroking anyone could expect rational response you. bad. Good thing talking Italy whatever happened Florida irrelevant discussion mention deaths due covid never actually tested. Death measures real inaccuracy moment. Manhattan Bronx want get pedantic That's without effective vaccines, mass produced successfully distributed enough population would speed process...

Then there's chance virus continues mutate/ adapt time. Though SARS NCoV 2 mutates much lower rate influenza family viruses, there's still always chance enough random mutations occur, especially 2.3 years, change virus operates... all, animal born ancestor virus obviously underwent series mutations led able jump humans, able spread explosively among humans, something cousin SARS 1 viruses like various Avian Flu scares past years able do. thought developed vaccine vodka bleach. Regardless findings regardless who/where UN sends investigate, West insist China wrong must punished whereas China insist done wrong actually trying help world.

I think reality way around, say thanks organized religion, humanity finally kill die. Putin's Russia, President elects himself. Yes is, obvious way talks? Yeah. Solve community problem individual solutions. Sounds fantastic going swimmingly. never told people wear them.  simply said people make sure healthcare workers able get enough order work.  longer ignorance purposeful spread misinformation needs made criminal offense. Amateurs, sometimes neighbor moans watch porn. That’s nothing, 3000 cases podunk Wisconsin alone yesterday. He's wrong Tell boss said he's narcissistic prick. Good luck mate, stay healthy. US ain't trustworthy either tho. way make somewhat safe rapid testing. might make completely safe, nothing either, sad day. Hopefully 16 point spread biden maintains. Lolll case need shutdown, see? dire situation people taking seriously.

Got tired restrictions? We're middle pandemic, people need grow deal somehow. understand physically mentally affected people endlessly whine can't go events parties, go parties anyways. supposed happy fun time, supposed get shit together species get happy fun time, without mourn god knows many deaths deal god knows many chronic long term effects health.

Half people ""just got tired restrictions"" never believed first place took every chance irresponsible stupid look Europe is, trending bad as, worse spring. pfft..

Obviously vary hugely depending specific populations look at. hate Broadway much? multiple comments say hope never reopen drought Art would good thing. room belly too. Trump basically Florida Man POTUS tho lol go right back unless people act like pandemic refuse follow common sense public health guidelines. Probably dumb question, positive rates higher ever Europe such, death rates low now? could afford Putin cronies would stop robbing country. fuck Right, better translation, doubt 😅 I’m sure Spain industries don’t rely tourism. read that, again, bringing Germany? never mentioned Germany. reopen schools Canada expect Vash Stampede show Russia. 2020 wild...

I've Rancho Cordova area times summer like different world Bay, barely masks anywhere went whereas still pretty much universal stores businesses...even going gas pump see people wearing definitely saw there. Dude that's rational argument. Like, all. 

You can't take total landmass country, compare population size call day, that's works.

Most russians live ""small"" european part country population density really high, rest russia basically empty.

I mean take one look size cities, Moscow population 12.5 million higher population density big US cities, moscow metropolitan area clocks whopping 20 million inhabitants St Petersburg 5 million. 

That's way bigger part densely populated biggest american cities Moscow arguably biggest city europe, earth would think it'd easy contain virus Russia?

Trump bot identified! right, unfortunately seems people getting much lax preventative measures.. happening. 7day average 1k cases long ago. week we've posted 1.2k, 1.5k, 1.8k... 

Hospitalizations death always lag behind new cases.. think we're also seeing younger people infected always require hospital care. bad trend set going traditional flu season us, especially holidays coming up.

I'm rural area, I've noticed HUGE drop mask usage last two weeks.

Its going bumpy keep things work slow spread keep eachother safe. talking about?

Pick poison. sure metric gerrymandering get that, that's important.  Alberta still surrounded low density population south, east, west. end result less population movement, less spread.

Ok Ontario. Northern Ontario empty. 

But 90 percent Alberta population lives Lethbridge Edmonton densely populated Quebec City Windsor. 

Plus Lower Mainland seeing cases fall. densely populated metropolitan area Canada. high transit use. stating rest Canada said that, playing martyr card work fine suppose?

That's basically headline implies. ""Canadians encouraged stay home second wave Covid-19 worsens"" except BC seeing cases decline month. company know business usual cases people taking advantage. Generally speaking, people happiest mix lot happier.

Hell, I've company years I'm fairly high right beneath C level, bunch crossover knowledge great relationships already built, STILL feel like career basically hold whole year this. term Hitler used refer Jews, assuming talking Dems?

Madrid situation absolutely crazy. check worldometer see false abruptly reduction cases recent days corrected days go by.**

** why?? clue... country world way. Yeah, check numbers! Less dead, less excess mortality 0 bankruptcies healthcare costs! insane place europe is. apparently sensitive test. We've seen sometimes count people antibodies coronavirus (including common cold) positive. can't tell that's problem not. 

The potentially good news, case, research suggesting antibodies may still offer protection. COVID fall window classify it? news keeping kinda stuff quiet. age death everywhere I've looked life expectancy

That necessarily mean going die soon. obviously varies country, U.S., life expectancy 80 year old man 88.7. actually circulation. Gyms allowed air conditioning. insidious virus is, it’s beautiful elegant. I’d like eradicated. Same! talk masks fools even wear seatbelts drive cars? Except need groceries eat going sports literally pointless nobody die Well, basically keep outsiders vaccine live normally within bubble. I'd trade come reddit isn’t calling French stupid like called Americans stupid? Well, matter. get over. get sent Walter Reed. One two. know true would like ask come conclusion?

It feels everyone speak prepared make sweeping statements based next substantiated ""evidence""

It's dig seems like another example someone heard repeated becomes common opinion. think saying risk minimal may exaggerating. COVID airborne distancing others may matter poor circulation gym. Well yeah guy right mask chin... wear mask enter shops. restaurants bars, people care anymore social distancing. say government isnt making people stay home see one that's bullshit people. I'm college student town past three weeks put public health orders anyone aged 18-22 allowed gatherings (defined yourself) anywhere town. city said would ILLEGAL drive roomate hospital go grocery shopping together. cannot go eat restaurants go friends houses even see outside without risk ticketed. propaganda isnt affecting you. Owned!!!! see vaccine said already working well them. /s Call protest we'll done it. WELL past point general lockdown place, fucking hospital numbers nothing it. lockdown get control DRIVE NUMBERS ZERO.

And course would noticeable effect, push numbers fast hard. alternative numbers continue rise, people continue die, significant numbers populous long last debilitative health impacts.

Any saying 'nah, matter' immoral crap hear often year. Dollar Tree sells bleach $1.

He could inject that.

I recommend it. Trump would...for people. himself, course. himself, Trump take experimental medicine developed aborted babies. Christie people Trump would recommend bleach. know? reason covid freaks specifically showing left people long term conditions like kind person worried about. normal flu, acting like is. ohhh come on!!! that's stereotypical! :P don’t suppose there’s way sewage testing? systems isolated enough? wouldn’t think so. surprise Boris said think ""and best number could lie us publish"" Stroopwafels between!

Guess many checkpoints enter leave Madrid ive seen way? 0. 

This another lie. even surprised point. Yeh enjoy karaoke Thanks lot fuelling anti-vaxxers Nancy. Unbelievable. Well aren’t many people left White House infect — herd immunity! drastically rising daily cases caused shutdowns literally today exaggeration Also Aussie, 100% true! Sibling rivalry! I'm sure many people buying argument. long substantial portion population staying home interacting society, can't get true sense hard immunity don’t think European countries got “right” per say bc cases rising everywhere 

apparently except 3 countries (Norway, Finland, Cyprus), they’ve reached tier ECDC (?) means they’ve seen spikes hit least certain level raise alarm 

so I’d say isn’t Sweden Norway got right lol + Finland Cyprus 

don’t link source believe BBC news article Space cakes FEBO 3 meals day isn’t norm? Same. won’t let people near days. (I’d lost without him.) too. Sucks doesn’t it? I’ve already taken 6 tests. chance Nope current situation Cali absurd. much different weirdo fascist fantasy scenario. biz owner employee got sick (possiblity job) would tell public got sick job? 
Like ol saying goes, hear speak, see evil. Assuming followed standards RECOVERY trial, yes got sicker average. true? Absolutely curious wonder person could find info sourcing purposes. Thanks Okay, know. I've lucky leave house Arizona much. run couple stores weekend super dismayed many people masks nose, mouth, seen. forget endangering national security sickening sorts people White House related government agencies. history important learn math science. Without historical context math science used terrible things. FDA big pushback white house stricter standards. Thanksgiving also realistic timelines companies talking about. 

The answer many people actually given expect 30 million US November December. Likely mostly healthcare workers number.

Regular non high risk people US likely looking March-April availability earliest timeline. surprised bit later. feel bad healthcare workers. don’t deserve definitely getting enough respect cooperation people Good job friend fighting good fight get winning lottery ticket think we'll see epidemiological recovery come waves vary state state, country country. recovery unified, like response wasn't. could many places reach heard immunity next near, others not. That's prediction right now, anyway. sentiment live (NYC) people unify take it, I'm sure said let's say...Florida Texas. People unilaterally want go back lives next Summer, pro-science / anti-science recovery. places returned 'normal' trust science, still problem hands hospitals becoming overloaded.

I'm sure there's really much leaders state aggressively mobilize vaccine education efforts people take it. hotspots keep popping up, they'll tough decisions make requiring immunization papers travel, attend events, school, work, etc. teachers really helpful. Sometimes hard therapies online I'm sure things lost translation person, they've made work degree.

That might option considered. main case manager wonderful work (she's one proctored MAPS AIMSWEB testing online) dropped supplies us might way teachers come us. 

I feel terrible though, remote person teaching also running around drop supplies families. can't imagine feel comfortable various risk levels need regardless. want pain ass make work them, want anyone risking anything necessary.

We're waiting hear back outside/masked &amp; distanced idea. they're ok think that's probably good enough, dawdle, hopefully least present (not necessarily close enough disturb proceedingd, enough see what's going on.) 

For picture day wanted kids go alone wear masks, could take photos (so everyone would maskless least minutes spot) made nervous. 

I understand letting parents keep vectors down, I'd want see happening. son weird things like beatbox/spit, throw ground roll around rub objects face he's getting overloaded (which photo day sometimes do) Covid times seems like asking trouble others. opted out. Phone cameras pretty good days anyway, maybe get ""real ones"" spring situation improves enough. Hopefully. mean say whether people host attend them. Except instances potentially transmitting something rarer medical professional hands patient, odds are, thinks something.


And Covid-19 steering wheel keyboard, need touching face. people time. point, mask barrier, nothing all. Thank you. often gets missed death/pop figures are. Top states NY, NJ, MA, CT, LA, RI (roughly order). Little RI 5th recently. basically confirming time time since April ""there willl going back Old Normal"".

There changes need made, made. going back. told.

I mean .. ""New Normal"". Right? catch part? That's top courses top unis. whole heap fake institutions people pretend study. third largest group students Nepal, one poorest countries world. Obviously also possibility residency attractive. *just* masks, taking reasonable precautions. 

Symbolising masks be-all-and-end-all trivialises situation. Basic awareness &amp; precautions yes, focussing one aspect fatal. 

Trump seemingly relied negative testing unmasked Whitehouse bubble, precautions. 

You mix outdoors, social distancing, masks sanitising generally covered gaps system. 1... 0... -1... -2... Honestly look Florida Arizona's daily new cases charts. They're identical. whole treatment medical equivalent ""small loan million dollars"", actuality turned $200k/yr getting age 3, constant bail-outs dad, eventually $400 million inherited.  hate articles talk public health measures indefinite term. What’s point? Buying time what? never going solve anything way. 

Social distancing masks good limit damage vaccine cure found, otherwise useless long term.

To honest point would better proper hard lockdown 4-5 months, completely eliminate virus (like zero cases). economic damage would catastrophic least possible restart. Better living forever distopic world need stay 6 feet apart muzzle. News one talking about: longer pandemic lasts, greater chance virus mutate mutation significant. Senate voting anything republican senators quarantine covid. Everyone looking thread look guys post history nothing politics USA big bad China#1 I’m binger too. I’ve got (most recent) pounds prove it.
Tomorrow, I’m getting touch local chapter Overeaters Anonymous starting virtual meetings, chatboards, ect available.

I’ll damned let ONE THING make vulnerable😡

To fair, though... vodka might making weight happen extra cookies day🤪😞 Check back two weeks. Also don’t want death rate lower ? Florida saw 75% drop cases without mask mandate.  tired Truth? strange comment make  Someone going die this. Chris Christie part debate prep he's hospital. Trump. Amphetamines, including methamphetamine, common prescription drugs. I'm sure he's gotten hands medications using connections pharmacutical companies, ones would anyone's guess. need two positive tests, test samples need available sequenced. need enough material sequenced. also need specialized laboratory that, cannot done pharmacies GP offices even many hospitals. technical issues well.

Also, researcher Marcelo Navarrete cited thinking vaccines likely work mutation well. 80-90% would fantastic, point know virus, I’d surprised it’s around number.

I imagine I'm one circumstance. I’d take chances odds many cases Wisconsin today? would rather die free man live oppressed person best part make choice. avoid contact high risk people, take basic hygiene precautions, wear mask contact essential workers high risk people. go live life guilt free, knowing risk spreading Covid someone vulnerable exceedingly low.

Meanwhile every week months see articles saying ""Covid flying around months knew it!"" ""10x many people Covid thought!""

That truth, right?

And testing WAY people ever before.  Doesnt make sense would finding lot cases back beginning?  Probably rumors status “get fucked” tried letting virus dominate him, like employer suggests?

Look anti-mask vid say it’s overblown it’s real. Sometimes articles videos check back people months road complete 180 actually experience Covid loved one did.
-	**4) Trump constantly downplaying:** I’m sure find many timeline videos beginning January Trump downplays virus much. goes never come 15 people get old people get It’s basically flu gone Easter summer kill It’s flu guys, cmon least 2.2 million people didn’t die someway inject sunlight bodies? We’re good job handling beat it, it’s nothing. last part crucial supporters emboldened keep spreading nothing bad happened candidate. They’ll even watch Fox News phone interview Hannity last night think got coughs

Over past couple months, I’ve pretty much observed. I’m really thinking it’s 2 4 keeping thing alive, especially 4. wear mask still get Covid, full face respirator overkill. Wisconsin started statewide mask mandate 2 months ago we're exploding. equivalent threatening beat someone reddit; saying completely unverifiable, therefore irrelevant. Let's assume however, telling truth: wealth given illusion status. Congratulations hard earned victory. able retire early, might broaden horizons, example learning *international* standard writing dates? pretty amazing made fortune without *ever* encountering widely used format, hey good you! false, though? Universities secondary schools closed spring. ""young people"" supposedly spread virus much primary school-aged children (and schools open continuously). bet won’t cause “accidental” side effects - medical corporations LOVE things free, look operate US! Well, least save cash since can’t go awhile. Also Group that's work grocery stores/ essential businesses entire pandemic, go person classes, go shopping older parents/relatives/neighbors, etc.


Yes selfish, arent, stop blaming us keeping economy going, without us, wouldnt able get groceries, even order things. think chinese people better following measures taken covid (at least compared people country. people act wearing mask apocalypse here). find pretty hard believe china, humongous country 1.5+ billion people multiple cities well 10 million residents, local cases almost 50 days... Yes. fine. don’t need hyperbole strengthen case Trump. weakens it. miss part press conference saying opposite? Geez. Regarding spread among students, Matilda Ernkrans also said: måste skärpa er \[och ta ert ansvar\]. 

which basically (a *slightly* polite way of) saying *""get shit together \[and take responsibility\]*"". think harsher tone useful, lot young people behaving carelessly might need direct message like this. travel comes Thanksgiving/Christmas, also business. nervous thinking Holiday shopping Black Friday.

My employer furloughed March pulling back now, numbers lower they’ve implemented new safety measures, they’re sick making money me. They’re pulling back profitable leading holidays miss out. I’m sure plenty companies making horrible call next couple months. Okay let know insanely restrictive lockdown finally ends.

Oh, also let know gov swoops locks *third* time cases inevitably break Yeah, families discussing this. make sure everyone stays safe, really think families need plan holidays. holidays going tough, saw case increases Memorial Day, 4th July, Labor Day, can't imagine like Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's. headlines ridiculous. much clickbait. Sweet comment arrogant prick fuck come November/Decmeber

for emergency use meaning risk people, front line workers. rest us available least April I’m lucky I’m stay home mom easy make decision. son absolutely thriving far learning goes year I’m able supplement kindergarten work he’s receiving challenging activities. 

However, logistics helping him, managing time, working three year old keeping occupied, keeping house clean food prepared much wearing me. I’m short people (although try spare kids husband), I’m exhausted I’m stress eating like crazy. It’s nowhere near ideal understand parents coming health family whole way important comfort right now. knew I’d make sacrifices parent that’s I’m doing. You’re right, right decision make. It'd even cooler drop stupid radiation scare 80's invest nuclear. US brainwashed anti nuclear propaganda decades. time what? 

To get everyone vaccinated. It’s going happen night. 

And depending effective vaccine is, may still enough susceptible people may take months virus actually die everyone vaccinated. many eight regions report outbreaks linked colleges universities, says.

Its almost like FUCKING AGENCY SPREAD MYTH YOUNG PEOPLE CANT GET DISEASE SCHOOLS HARMLESS.

CAN FUCKS TAKE LITTLE BIT RESPONSIBILITY?!? also nightmare reopening schools said never closed March.  Putin self isolating 6 months, lets citizens die. wonder many people total left NYC due Virus, last heard like 400k people something. I've seen quite retailers already post in-store black Friday year. hope retailers follow suit. It'd idiotic encourage kind chaos right I'm thankful Walz. perfectly clear. you. iceland better react quick. virus moves speed lightening.

and people iceland better take fuckin serious answered question - think effective.

On grounds think effective, study study proves effective cutting spread? Good point. think come UK perspective (I'm Brit living Germany still unfortunately works London experience countrys' dealings covid, politically ground.) UK imo said lot more, albeit absolute bullshit. stuff German government said imo much blunt, point, rooted reality. Unless put boots ground force people stick rules, really come us individuals right thing. many Germans issue that, still mostly bother mask train supermarket unlike fellow citizens UK busy arguing mild asthma ""exception"" want wear mask whatever reason open coughing trains supermarkets. 

I've work London last month perhaps I've missed something back home trying figure job without catching covid. put way - I'm counting minutes come back 10 days hunker down. Perhaps Merkel et Al could say more, point really know say make need listen take action change behaviour. Either people cautious risk assessing go along, toeing line prevention topping mental physical health way, care/deny severity existence virus. wish knew answer I've lost many friends year conspiracy bullshit covid denial. I'm sure politics cure that, id love know ideas! Stockholm winter holiday (spring break) last week (9) March. Didnt get sputnik shot? needs science already answers via unshakable testimony one true gospel? possible chance perform coup, it’s senior military staff commission easily impressionable officers charge. also blaming Trump Funny works, huh! rest world figured back March. America catching up. apocalypse here; someone wrote ""mask"" piece paper. horror terror cannot comprehended mortals. pre-existing condition falling window. vaccines questionable efficiency people even going take first. Court rooms going packed think question, along many others, keep epidemiologists business decades.

My read sparse literature background mortality rate, least first months, \~5% expected. 

In USA, 5% translates \~130k deaths might COVID-related March thru end August.

Crudely, means might approaching 500k deaths. plan show Thanksgiving, stay whole month Christmas, drive back New Year's. Maybe friends party week so. Yeah Hi French, rosbif here. Watched Tour de France. Madness still went looking back manic climbs full people without masks. Controversial: Case counts less significance it’s established many people don’t die virus. also ""Goodbye covid"" party back May. Lmao, else ""skip"" vaccine coming? I’ve got co-worker says family usually goes beach four times year. *gestures everything*, haven’t gone year. She’s currently trying plan trip Florida/Disney sometime around Christmas hell-if-I-know. head security needs toughen let COVID dominate life, there's nothing afraid of. Trump said front White House, God gave virus Trump, got Trump told doctor drugs use, worked! Trump found cure. fake news media reporting anything stop winning election, they're disgusting.

(Do need include /s? I'm afraid do, deranged paragraph reads, stuff Trump said therefore stuff supporters probably believe). Thanks. I’m special events get almost 0 focus Congress despite industry completely destroyed night. are/were 12 million workers events space one really thinks put fun slink shadows. HURTING. Also, work specialized nowhere turn to. made $120k 2019 dropped $0 career March. family surviving whatever government deems adequate us wife’s much smaller salary. really idea do. Abandon 13+ yr career get entry level job supermarket? guess. won’t enough rent diapers baby.  Why? still try keep 1-2 yard distance people I'm about, wash hands regularly, travel places high infection rates. adhere things proven effective. refuse wear mask uncomfortable fuck think effective - least type settings i'm in. Also need register hotels. Hotels allowed ask passport drivers license.. Registers need stored time (tax reasons). Imagine known March effective simplemask was. think it, could honestly get 1-3% CFR again. years flu vaccine nothing wrong strains circulating. Even years, there's comparison covid even drastic measures we've taken covid.

Also nite first big bump covid deaths circulating without shutdowns mask use. That's like without those.  would entire US, people stubborn. would’ve back normal life months ago. It’s simple safe caring people. We’re human deserve treated equally. Listening big problem ohhhhh money 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ would awesome. also cases people getting paid get false positive hospital's make money it. sides coin. take account end average whatever number now. Lots toll yet paid deaths despair, poverty (although mostly developing nations) cancer. dwarf Covid deaths thanks panicked fools. exactly works... need extensively verify safety general public people willing take it. I’m giving brand new vaccine kid I’m 100% confident about. Give necessary data trials gladly first line, wide scientific consensus. don’t trust Trump administration, vaccinating family feel vaccine rushed due political pressure. ""cloning antibodies"" misleading works. regular (tailor made) antibodies, harvested culture cloned immune cells. immune cells sourced mice, humans, antibody ""humanized"". harvested antibodies injected patient Well soon reopened would right back increased infections. way really stop close stay closed vaccine out...but also put families economic hardship without income supplement passing might well pass UBI, chance getting approved long enough duration covid require. Testing would equal cases, positivity rate go up. Neither hospitalizations deaths. Yeaaa see. Science works matter twisted fuckery believe in. ""believe"" science, isnt opinions like religions are. objectively observed facts patterns. Wear masks stay safe. RIP lost lives due Covid-19. really seem ‘over’ virus 

I hear pubs might shut Monday though Florida California similar drop active corona virus case deaths. purely political posts allowed - sides insulting other, get removed. Masks protect others. enjoy benefit others wearing masks shitting efforts wearing mask.

It's selfishness. better everyone else? deserve comfort mask everybody else carries burden? bit doubtful especially cases like going on.But start guess.
 Herman Cain tweeted support message. ppl sheep still scared virus, businesses closed nothing much u abt comparison, Italy – whose population six times larger Czech Republic’s, reported 2,677, Germany 2,828, **and new cases recorded Sweden**.

there clearly 500+ reported Wednesday. inaccuracies wouldnt give much reporting... hiding fact looking numbers France compared Germany Italy, something different going right now,”

And day Germany Italy new records since spring, experts Germany fearing community spread now, cannot get tracked. yourself. Wear mask face shield gloves leave house. anything affect personally?

Bullshit attitude. **love neighbour**, tell **your neighbour love he's super scared.** Yeah, biased opinion - research anything behind - beats academic study actually researched issue. Got it. understand people say exist.  Thank you. Apart fever OK. 8 days in, fingers crossed.

I know many americans battle economic anxiety top Covid. Its' less issue here. 

Luckily work home (and wife compensated) economical impact us negligable. goes danes, though air travel, hotels, restaurants, bars entertainment industry devastated well. general danish economy done OK this. 

And yeah, even though wife lucked think keeping schools education open distancing measures hygiene place necessary strategy - obviously line dance especially winter. There's sure fire way go this.  America, stupid come rain. Proof/source? another prejudice towards basically everything China does? Borderline Racism guess think it’s fine. I'm you. I'm actor (not paycheck, duh) middle rehearsing going really good, at-the-time relevant show. know if, when, able show probably current event topic nearly ever get there. positive feeling building use theater fingers crossed owners lose it. edit brand name popular crunchy cheetah advocated snack get past digital gatekeeper Unless livestream. Anything prerecorded. Maybe that's meant? advantage edit retakes. sure that's meant, way made sense me.  Berlin, NRW Frankfurt really worrisome moment. They’re spiking rapidly, lead case numbers bigger April. Yes, numbers quite small compared countries per capita basis. 

I would say now, Germany Italy managed delay second round we’re less middle it. bad Austria, Czechia, Netherlands, Belgium, France, hope heavy controls restrictions border Science nice. Oranje iggee like ""that's fake news"" guys thrilled govenor spent coronavirus funds paying SD tourism advertising? I'm really sorry. fear Presidential visit coming way weekend too. Stay safe. happening 8-9 months. maybe already illnes right? hoax right? getting dumb Tucson though, keep seeing people without masks stores one enforcing mask rules incredibly lucky. video game character, luck maxed out. That’s it. mother pick grandmother Arizona quarantine started. People literally mocking mother wearing mask public. Dumb fuckers. I'm sorry, way date information.  fire authorities integrated controlled burning like first people decades (they hunt game it).  

It working recently *weather* hot dry year round number controlled burns per year keep bush safe can't performed.  enough days year dew ground morning get round every section roster.

If weather returns pattern like last 6 years again, we'd probably need hundred times current number firies trained go go go like swat team around entire nation suitable days controlled burn. people want rights none responsibilities. Thankfully Australians generally share sense responsibility towards wellbeing country. brother goes Disney religiously - he's gone three times year, said almost empty... entire family NY told he's insane even trying, upon return time parents basically force quarantine 14-days him. Truly. I'm overweight lockdown.

I know reverse that, I'm still struggling adjust new circumstances.

I've lifelong battle weight last years really well. lockdown happened. Love westerners know nothing China besides propaganda fed day act like know COVID like better actual people living there. brother works Beijing VISA couple weeks ago new cases EVERYTHING traceable. Sure CCP really aren’t much “BUT MUH FREEDOM” total control actually able contain virus. Trump pulls miracle drug cocktail ends killing one staff don’t get treatment, Dems better use info crush November deaths don’t go unavenged. Trump digging political grave hard this. Wow almost listening health experts Donald Dumbo actually works! never got highschool graduation. even know college campus.  Beating people wearing masks definitely bad. still doubt would two years adopted practice. Suppose did. two years, would say ""well, masks still needed x, y, z."" part adopting culture mask wearing gives away.

Basically, several issues mask-wearing beyond vaccine. First, significant ecological impact associated it. litter enough trying curb much possible. Sure, wear reusable cloth masks many do? Besides that, social problems described above. Winter coats cause problems. There's also economic problems. can't eat restaurant mask on, can't ever see working gym mask on. hard enough breathe one is. way around selectively pick choose indoor venues wear mask in, would seem almost defeat purpose wearing mask first place.

Ultimately, went back normal Spanish Flu. People stopped wearing masks. see different now. Floridian? There’s mask mandate DeSantis, suspended police fining mask compliance violation local levels. However schools, counties, businesses majority mandating masks. causation, perhaps; correlation, yup. steadily 2000 cases daily past 30 days, even phase 3-full open-for 2 weeks now. believe masks mandates keeping steady amongst COVID fatigue. Maybe even longer. Looking summer peak US deaths lag almost month. know Reddit, anything regarding Utah obligatory mormons hypocrites, sanctimonious, foolish, gullible, etc. 

 But, live suburb salt lake everywhere go, people going way wear masks. single public place fewer 98% people wearing masks. And, go SLC, seems people even stringent masks. 

Besides that, whatever reason, young population, healthy population, sunshine, altitude, etc, COVID kind Utah. Currently 0.4 percent death rate. course slightly higher flu. course deaths occurring elderly people, many living care facilities. 

I think people realizing actual risks dying COVID extremely small Utah, social them, family gatherings, dance 
parties, exercising gym, etc, worth risk. 

Let live lives whichever way see fit. super scared COVID, underlying condition, stay inside. Quarantine yourself. Wear mask face shield gloves leave house. anything affect personally?

In free society, never try limit people's individual freedoms false guarantee temporary safety. Whatever threat may be. /u/tbox  did! 2nd chart page. Also 3rd chart, broken month, even informative. Keep spamming comment everywhere. really helpful discussion. stage, there's one thing need covid, *definitely* scrutinizing effectiveness masks. 
 
""They probably help....BUUUUTTT, let's get excited them!"" chinese friends already back person classes celebrating golden week (week long holiday). staked open 2022 current rate.. noon today. miss KL plates.

I've also seen interesting things like adding AG Frankfurt plates, seen CH Bitburg plates. K added Füssen plates. would facetious? We’d way vaccines then, anyways? Problem around 50%+ people/workforce essential maintain societal infrastructure rely survive. That’s enough people still transmit allow virus remain viable. 

There thing hard lockdown. you’d literally kill well 50% population due hunger, dehydration, disease, murder, elements, etc. probably closer 95% population. 

For virus mostly kills elderly unhealthy, total rate population survivability 99.8%? 2-3x deadly flu. I’ll take hard lockdown. Please say stuff like unless scientist/epedemeologist/virologist, etc. Yeaaah, tell won’t get anywhere convincing you, since Sith lord. reason RCTs test basic science premises (i.e., factors can’t control predict vitro lab). might predict virus particle pass mask, rubber meets road, actual science matters says masks work. fuck ignorance. tire trying convince headstrong internet strangers shit think understand. Respect comment. one people run fire. not. Hopefully there's us them. need vaccine fix stupidity. Well, selfish asshole, you. Sadly, almost everyone thinks like help spreading virus point reached vaccine help anymore amount permanently disabled people causes economy completely collapse. much missing manpower keep things running. people can't hold still vaccine arrives. FDA packed actual scientists doctors. approved, legit.

I sure FDA employ number actual scientists medical doctors. believe even one minute political approval anything actual scientific approval.  people currently run FDA, political appointees.

I sincerely wish organization dominated political appointees. But, claim not, without merit.

How regular person tell? phd medicine. know people, usually read journals. Regular people, less education, go trust. trust? America always great giving lower caste right lose everything.

!remindme 5 years Fuck that's depressing in, scientists say water wet!  Well farmings taken hit without guys sending backpackers work crumbs.  Due this, university opening classes person next week. really hope cases don’t shoot back Seems so. cases numbers March, could reach peak April cases month. northern states see data here: (German site). graphs look good. Cool, agree, least first stanza. people contrary opinion I'd like get straight answer from. Like get 200,000 considerably worse 60,000 (flu season years ago), know I'm supposed look former see ""unspeakable tragedy blood hands"" looking latter saying ""eh, that's life."" people die influenza's lives matter less die covid. Wow. coincidence.

Cases went masks required?

I wonder caused decease. Sounds like kind miracle.

Now would please pardon kill fly that's following around days driving crazy.

Mommy... seen truth flies fly swatter?

Never mind. I'll pray away. Idiots, untold numbers idiots. Actually americans come canada drugs...  using religion kindness manipulate people wearing masks one nothing other?  Mormon Christian prefer wear mask. afraid others wearing mask think work well, content. bother someone wear mask. think he’s using since peak, Florida’s Covid curve flat, despite state fully sure news source allowed. take government progaganda news sources grain salt regardless country originate in. giant hole opened swallowed thousands people per month usual monthly mortality. Old people cannot move fast escape it. free money.

If people wanted pay look baloney pony would stop them. Reinfections happening much though, I've seen. was, news would bringing regular people covid got would talking it. people could reinfected, would vaccine even work? fuck?

What low-quality comment???  saying biological warfare successful (and easy) way annihilate America? know feeling aware MN Covid deaths 3 states combined despite close 2 million fewer people? wife personal reasons feel way? know that's loaded question... really odd statement make research scientist make. technically correct, literally made stem cells weird distinction make. like arguing makeup made using animal testing animal testing literally makeup. COVID fatigue, I'm also getting tired bragging New Zealand Taiwan. island, everyone knows. obviously lot things right, also dealt much stronger hand. it? Hmmm. Yes. appears floor made of... floor. Public Health England admitted 16,000 confirmed coronavirus cases UK missed daily figures reported September 25 October 2. missing figures subsequently added daily totals, given importance numbers monitoring outbreak making key decisions, results error far-reaching. wish would charted total mortality. evidence turn sasquatch either I'm bringing Even take rent equation, still need pay labor, resources, water, electricity. making much cover costs worth open. Made fetal tissue Trump administration against. hypocrite. like would case fact virus airborne gets access cutting edge medical tech mankind ever had, course he's well. believe taking 4kIU/day got sick blood work done even within acceptable window amount. taking 10k/Day months feel better. I'm black winter coming always makes feel terrible. discovered vitamin last year whim onset winter immediate bodyaches feelings existential dread. I'm 27 btw. Uuuh what. countries taking big depression level economic dips shutdowns happening. brutal stuff even imagine even worse stuff. fucking unnecessary. RIP. don’t see agents family can’t sue negligence. Yup even know half yet. We're early whole process. even fucking year. health systems overwhelmed spike, everybody die covid. Covid mortality also go up. Covid also attacks heart. Last, heart disease sort catch death certificates would even spike situation. there's definitely element truth people already sick risk die get hit 2nd blow (e.g. COVID), there's also confounding factors, like fewer people going hospital year (because they're scared contract COVID, hospitals shut non-essential visits while) maybe cancer diagnosis - subsequently ""cancer deaths"" - gone down. 

But anyway! None really point. Take look 3rd graph page (""April cruelest month.."" Total deaths, regardless cause, **enormously** 2020 compared months previous years. Whatever want say cause death, people dying unprecedented rates. 

Also, anything, final chart page suggests COVID deaths under-reported. Lately, 4th leading cause death basically ""unknown reason"" (the black line) normally hovers near bottom. might COVID well, lack better explanation. might ""missing"" cancer deaths people never got diagnosed 2020 died sleep. deaths beginning pandemic due breakouts care homes. deaths last 3 months, yet economy almost fully functioning again. (And course, deaths per capita still much lower US) Nazi's gassed murdered people bro. Mostly everyone Nazi's except Nazi's. people science turn around benefit different story. kept privatizing shitload stuff Sweden long time everything keeps getting worse it. seriously get keep getting away it. also got rid defence storages supplies etc shortage first months pandemic unlike Finland still storages.  Best comparison probably Canada since similar geographic pros/cons US, similar timing lot COVID-19 actions (stopping travel, etc). difference political leadership Canada took seriously, Canada 40% many deaths (per capita) COVID US. means around 100,000 Americans could saved dying COVID Trump Republicans taken seriously. Tragic...and infuriating. I'm opinion heal move whole Trump cult built around GOP time Tea Party needs fully exposed expunged. Otherwise Trump-like candidates turn five years mindset change. make China looks suspicious Wonder there's correlation there... don’t care vaccine comes from, long saves lives many side effects, say, let one It’s acceptable, period. Dustin Hoffman, Mutaba shit, ok. literally dealing pretty benign illness. 

As population increases planet, shit get worse. Maybe it’s time accept small cullings there. Let people decide risks want take. name some? haven’t able find epidemiology bona fides far. Yeah, I’m incredibly lucky TV show starting back now. expecting pretty much same. Shit’s brutal. I’ve never work long life. March. trying save lives everything novel virus. also turned respirators made worse, completely unexpected. long time since technology today, used would taken years know do. Death rates plummeted reason. hard-working scientists. political. Biden would smart keep guy around. They've saying Thursday whole time... 1am night announced. Thank you! people want nitpick every covid death problem flu deaths estimate &amp; actual count. Wow, almost masks block shit comes mouth nose... [Futurama adult version Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Fuck [mom / government], can't tell do!!! nurse. Laughing what? yet serious investigating coronavirus's origins, looking even suspicious. Who? Head security? Seems like Rona still test negative symptoms. Someone give Trump. Everyone would tested get near him. logic doesn’t really work trump would obviously it. fill ;) exactly even trying claim? Thusfar nebulous string ""we data, people held hostage.""

If much definitive data, still posted single link? Legit, picture video saw demonstrations, someone wearing mask seemed either exception counter-demonstrator. words, loses, he'll arrested within week.

Marked. 

I read post last week Trump faked Covid, know? Trump announced it, he'll take hydroquinine claim cured. 

most reddit lost goddamn mind can't think critically anymore. Christianity morality separated long time ago.... 2000 years precise Every country get second wave, because... well don’t know, pandemics like work Track &amp; Trace isn’t “run excel”, I’m fan Boris that’s false.

The test reporting data csv format converted old XLS file format loading reporting platform. 

It’s different system track &amp; trace, fault woefully poor integration, nothing built excel. Oh fuckin left guy, escaped shithole. Flyover state life. ""Human rights""

Yeah I'm gonna waste time arguing someone puts two together. People wearing masks rest lives now. become new normal lot people saying understand science. saying 1,000 voters Pennsylvanian fracking industry might difference winning losing. Eliminate electoral college care that. I’ve interactions own, customer grocery shopping seeing assholes don’t adhere safety protocols. say something. I’m ALWAYS met bitchy response. grocery store one time heard customer tell clerk medical exemption. looked picture health, unmasked child. simply stared daggers her. eyes met know seen look disgust eyes. freaking way medical issue prevented wearing mask short time store. 

I’m sorry deal self-centered morons. wow ok lol like it... live sedona everyone wears masks here. mandate seems like people agreed it. yet hear even one person know lives come contact virus. hate much live here? US catastrophe admittedly countries fairly effective responses second waves 

Industrialized Asia 1/100th US rate. Europe's best performers roughly 1/4th US rates worst maybe 50% higher. comparing peak worst European nations trough US. look masked me. see sticking tongue audience? guess German karens book vacation Creta. failing factor viral load. Depending what's exhaled, dilution may help x amount minutes. counter unknown, need keep filtered air flowing needs close enough drawing unfiltered air way person protected. see American foreign policy conflict national interests.

Isn't enough reason anti American? Tennis better sport covid.  functors morphisms, F ya in: masks effective prevention, knew? aware usa going spend 10 trillion dollars due economic fallout lockdowns? 200k unhealthy 80 year olds (on average) died. cost 50 million dollars per unhealthy old person. also one complains spend 21k cancer treatment? 

The mind-boggling hysteria ppl covid insane. aware 725k ppl die per year heart disease? aware neverending getting worse? ban sugar meat? forcing ppl run hour day? extracting 99 percent money productivity extend lives unhealthy ppl? ""Experts"" 3 trips planned year, 12 2021. wait see refgure everything less savings :/ Lets look places highest death rates:  
1. New Jersey (voted Democrat) 
2. New York (voted Democrat) 
3. Massachusetts (voted Democrat) 
4. Connecticut (voted Democrat) 
5. Louisiana (voted Republican) 
6. Rhode Island (voted Democrat) 
7. Mississippi (voted Republican) 
8. Washington D.C. (Democrat) 
9. Arizona (Republican, barely) 
10. Illinois (Democrat) 


Not sure interesting thing is. looks like 7/10 highest death rates voted Hillary Clinton 2016. top 4 worst death rates voted Clinton.  
Not sure else interesting wanted see? think anything settles fast coughed out. ""normal"" moisture droplets around minutes settling. could wrong. Maybe jumbo droplets get loose without cough. believe beginning lockdown Don’t even understand point vulnerable (mostly) going vaccinated months anyways cause drama low countries, least beginning. Mainly limited hospital admissions due capacity.

In UK, estimate end March north 100K infections day.

Without proof, remain convinced seeing slow growth period record took place Feb early March  far lower pop density... Dan Scarvino. Look up. physician stated fact, “we doubt President going recover.” don’t say something like that, Doctor, without concrete proof.

A normal physician wouldn't. trump approved spin doctor would.  


Trump completely lying, people around lie. He's one said covid hoax wasn't.  


not going believe lies again, there's proof he's better. He's certainly making appearances anywhere. insane hold state? fact 70 percent population state fact LDS. LDS members allowed hold government positions? Salt Lake City constantly rebels anything LDS related, LGBTQ mayor. hear gripe alot, I'm sure much foundation. agree. one answers, especially least strive handle effectively. 

Are able go park? somewhere away home, workplace? Well, yea. That’s obvious. Like water wet. saying context implies something nefarious. Like prerecorded days sick something. protecting vulnerable look like practice? many people - 30 million UK? add this, cold necessarily cause issues, exacerbates them. also increases likelihood getting flu, like COVID, worsen heart attacks stroke. hope you’re able hold onto that! It’s oftentimes dichotomy. me, grateful job, yet time hate it. Hope employer going cover healthcare costs. australia enthusiast italy here, good job Aussies ♥️🇮🇹🇦🇺♥️ viruses arent alive real reason? God real often not, good things happen really bad people every day. Give freaking break. Utah awesome wish LDS church control. issue masks, organizations pro-mask LDS church. idea Mormon church strong control people wearing masks absurd.  


Furthermore. around Salt Lake quite bit. people wearing masks wherever go. say one place definitely masks. Went downtown Salt Lake last weekend, bar/club district. tons packed night clubs bears. mormons, fewer conservatives. Even less masks. one wearing masks inside crowded clubs, mormons.  


You apologize mormons Utah slander, delete stupid comment. £2 Deloitte consultant, good price Another reason 'nuke' pharma companies compliance. I’m 26 take 50,000 IU weekly levels crazy low. (10) testing. Treatment improved bit, game changer therapies horizon.

CFR meaningless. IFR pretty much same. U.S. full length mink coat? That’s pretty 70’s. can’t see that’s desired item decade. minority 

In Utah?! LOL Seems sus vehicle him? Nothing changed within last 3 weeks though. that's true. EU countries track second wave. Hospitals designed run full capacity time. business. like restaurant. set many tables customers. I'm sorry hear glad hear made through. hope full recovery. 

So happy helps you. can't remember heard /s better err side abundance caution. ordered medical masks overseas source early March still trying tell people masks necessary also utilized services soon available March. 

We lucky son took two month unpaid leave work bought container built tiny home property could help us out. time worked together upgrade things thought important like internet, generator power outages, organized food storage system, install light exercise equipment, etc. took care essential needs leave ran still ""contact"" services need. really made time much bearable would been. wish everyone could someone could help like this. real morale booster well physical emotinal support.

Good luck rest us. 🤞 Years ago, like couple decades, saw interview 2 economists. don’t recall were, remembered said, middle class slowly eroded point would 2 classes, wealthy impoverished. prediction seems bearing fruit. Good Lord hope guy going OK lasting health complications member Secret Service job protect imbecile unfortunately current leader free world. medical advice decided go joyride waive Utah one lowest death rates covid country. I'm sure New York one places insanely high death rate going lecture them. yet least. country fab intel CPU. However, intel flopping lately... conspiracy theories get credence. God sent plenty scientists warn them. Florida hit 3000 5000 day. Everyday. Sweden's weekly averaged cases about:
Week 38 - less 300/day
Week 39 - 400/day
Week 40 - 500/day

so definitely increase peaked yet. using places like indeed.com? nothing, even minimum wage could do? hope you’re able find something soon! Yeah, like movie speaks spanish, name? He's most, general yes, super rich mega corps more. Florida ain’t Southern Hemisphere, bubba Yeah much better compliance social distancing well democrats acted like republicans would civil war rn. would easy take advantage situation social restrictions? see everyone going Walmart Costco. Even everything ""locked down."" People really get disease spreads 100 million people kills 1% much worse disease spreads 1 million people kills 10%. 

A large portion society thinks get taxed way make money, might take home less tax brackets. Banning US tourists sufficient American military Japan good job spread covid. know China’s pharmaceutical practices specifically known cut corners going take risks all? ""well have'nt made lots money, realy grown up!!1"" Home depot thing... We've given lots bonuses. situation Europe looks pretty troubling. one consolation least seems like fatality rate much lower (we're getting better treatment, presume?) already people wondering republicans infected intentionally done nefarious means. argue, no, consequence dumbassessness- wearing masks, social distancing, hugging crap. like working home depot lol. least treat us well. done self righteous listening pontificate? Like STFU; know nothing me, know two paragraphs. Ridiculous hypocrisy coming someone won’t STFU nuance subtlety. 

This last time waste energy I’m sure get last word wallow smug sense moral superiority. Oh irony. B.b.but China bad I'm gonna cry. I'm sure dies Trump held accountable show compassion... can't even get sarcasm, sad point, every new day brings sadness. According his(trump) interview, trump treated himself. told ""them"" give him.

So, yeah, I'd agree you. person world able obtain cocktail. confusing people keep fixating one sentence said early pandemic completely disregarding everything said since then.

No major ""mask technologies"". always saturation mask wearing. plenty masks now, production rampups civilian efforts sew homemade masks. Even mask cuts transmission 70% whatever, 100% people wear them, that's huge difference.

This national/global crisis. leader nation, Trump bears responsibility direct population. direction points encouraging mask wearing, see article. 

Just wear damn mask. I'm sorry man, seems really rough. get though, meantime hope goverment really steps make time easier people like getting brunt this. able get unemployment atleast looking new job? see metadata video video preexisting video? one example whining intervening. [Here’s threat White House could overrule FDA. agree need ensure safe, nonpartisan vaccine, surely isn’t helping cause. Donald Trump got AIDS vicinity spraying blood. appreciate too. Fuck fed. Lol. Anothe PRC snowflake contributes sedentary lifestyle. know countless people used virus excuse stop working out. even stopped walking dogs. talking people whose physical activities work, school, shopping. get fatter worry dolphins even manage half anyway...

But serious note, Floridian want let everyone know, like us brains, help us.. man! swear keeps God damn fuck sub full dipshits Playing people's lives fine you. That's depressing. still help people shitty immune systems fair better would without vaccine, helping drive death rate? Nobody knows. Thxbai. Good thing moved schools back 100% capacity North Idaho! geniuses here. Viruses won’t get us! /s he’s chosen God expose defeat satanic pedofilic left wing Democrats. 1 - Invest company

Yes! took words right mouth. rhetoric dangerous. think people need familiarize concept pyrrhic victory. needs *foreign* enemies that? already Republican Party. imagine San Marinese may offended comment lol No, think objectives align. Uber rich multinational companies want higher taxes wealthy want oversight protect workers environment. Crippling U.S. government allows retain control pretty much whatever want. foolish shortsighted, that's pretty much always fatal flaw unregulated capitalism. again... people take fucking walkways.

Even slow area like front house (even blockades) steady trickle pedestrians excess reasonable time limit light breeze clear area. right here. I'm getting extra $50 week keep extending it. see signs they'd stop anytime soon people (3 actually) reddit keeps spreading misinformation wishing people die. I’m north idaho. people talk basically say “it’s worse flu” frankly don’t care.

There’s mandate here, people still don’t wear masks public don’t bat eye you’re wearing one. Costco place requires mask entry. that's actually got info haha, love blog. Also hoping interim analyses turn well! Apparently Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccine candidates already rolling review European Medicines Agency Canadian health agency, seems like pretty good sign. Antimaskers: turned 5g  It’s time move gives shit anymore? money, money. money! K looked figure. Thats great thanks. concerned he’s going donate trillions pay us lockdown ... oh wait Hopefully voting help get Trump office. bars still closed, keep way. Ah shame. Yeah I’ve known people 20 years (the others restaurant 7 years). They’re good humans. feel them. feel me. shitty situation.
 
I hear Vietnam incredibly well keeping Covid down. I’m guessing tourism well? ouch, stressing job right now. Disney opening time soon hope. Take care! hope pandemic ends soon [Not early sure /s not. Forcing entire population wear masks everywhere vaccine widely available would insane. article must talking worst-case scenario vaccine never happens, zero reasonable explanation extreme measure like that. Like secret chips got implanted boards eventually ended many military commercial systems. turn electronics better Red Dawn effect EMP.

My father still icu NRB oxygen mask doctor said recovering crp level (infection) decreased 148 ~30 
He speak bit better yet :( im mentally disturbed taking tension every single thing russia tho wasn’t asking you, unless alt showing said months ago mRNA vaccines could push 90% efficacy bat one believed me. hood numbers really promising. surprising see work. people shitty immune systems begin (obese, diabetics, old) get limited protection vaccine.  bet know you. Gotcha. yeah, though think they’re allowing lower bound 95% confidence interval low 30%. recently released (page 17):

“To ensure widely deployed COVID-19 vaccine effective, primary efficacy endpoint point estimate placebo-controlled efficacy trial least 50%, statistical success criterion lower bound appropriately alpha-adjusted confidence interval around primary efficacy endpoint point estimate want nice breakdown efficacy statistics, Derek Lowe great job talking Here’s hoping first interim analyses come back positive. Ron still full send till none constituents vote 2022.. cause we're dead. Asian countries starting re-open travel China. know hard time accepting dealt it.

Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, even Japan, managed deal it. template based China's methods dealing it: Lockdown, extensive contact tracing, isolate everyone anyone contact infected.

It works, effective. Don’t go anywhere. It’s hard! Take action stop relying actions others. Get n95 kn95 mask worry viral particles may breathing in. condescending, satire announcement? can't tell. first business meetings ended CEO praying jesus making disgusting comment Jewish people, there's that.

Do honestly think exclusive Arizona? something serves us right  I'd say likely checking pompeo's stooges team. mean still trying clean evidence 9 months clearly good job it. K tuba, maybe. Ya think $64K question is, money coming from? Oh, they're going ""borrow"" it. Well, going borrow from? Hm'mm, Federal Reserve. So, Federal Reserve get money ""loan""?  They're printing folks (or electronic equivalent). exit strategy. care. vaccine available, get it. everyone get vaccine want one, tolerate restrictions?

People, come Florida. lot Einsteins Florida South Korea lock down, get 0 testing tracing like crazy. worked started early. Lock delay measure. Lock stop turn back clock exponential curve. Ultimately containment measures like testing tracing main approach. need lock mainly COVID fast trace after, lockdown pull back range control. lockdown know control unreachable, would bloodbath. Well, that's booster shots thing, even measels booster shot iirc. worth, 5% pretty small chance still, yeah. We're kinda playing ear point, figuring things go along. USA levels back August 7th Levels err.. 14th.. think someone else posted. matter aware strategy. thought making went along haphazard random manner. someone used attend quite live events (concerts, clubs, festivals) pre-COVID, assure people attending live events never going attend online events. many things people attend events there, meeting friend group, away home, loud music, good sound systems, light shows, meeting random people, physical contact, on. Even going spend fraction money spent real life live events. maybe small percent people involved events make living it, going luck. Furthermore switched online events going switch back real life events soon again, I’d see temporary workaround long term investment. excellent points. Corporate bankruptcies good, personal bankruptcies bad... I've Florida one stops cruise. lovely beaches. thanks, right now. reduced load, lymphocytes immune cells able easily clear rest system.

Seems unlikely trashed immune system. rest claims seem like wishful thinking, sounds like cure not.

While doctors certainly know lot do, sounds though decisions made trump, instance use Regeneron. health also potentially misrepresented, evidenced video appearances.

What's nonsense believing anything coming Trump doctor's mouths. google translate. It’s great. happens families separated - meet quarantine them?


The action committee East Iceland Civil Defense Committee encourages come East Iceland stay capital area take break 14 days entering area prevent spread Covid-19 infections.

This stated announcement action board today.

It says action government knows many people interested moving parts country light state epidemic. Therefore, reiterates recommendation epidemiological authorities people travel capital country all, unless urgent need.

It emphasized fishing trips, workplace trips considered urgent matters unless necessary.

In cases people consider necessary move regions, action government encourages people take special care dealing others take break 14 days arriving east.

The Action Committee requests recommendations respected, way ensure infections spread regions, measures taken.

The situation still unchanged east one active infection registered according Covid.is. Five quarantined. Definitely right thing otherwise they're going become hotspot next California would required Golden State quarantine anyone Arizona. Keep West coast pact alive here. working since March dropped 35lbs.

At 175lbs now, looking drop another 10 15. cherry picking much.

Edit: ""order magnitude"" also bit excessive. Norway, total deaths Sweden 2020 within yearly variation. Look 2015, instance, bad flu year.  Nowhere article back claim deaths trending upward. read it? dumb. see depressed. many, many examples countries taken pandemic seriously Sweden sometimes order magnitude (roughly 10x) better outcome Sweden (i.e. Norway, one). sure, let's cherry-pick compare pandemic dumpster fires world. I’m waiting coronovirus task force start testing positive. Irony strong administration. depends. 6 months face swelled within 7-10 days. don’t get swelling even longer term use, balloon pretty quick. really wished state Governments won’t able lockdowns citizens won’t comply That’s pretty paranoid dude. LOT people sub shame stepping foot outside, seeing family, things mentioned.

And describe life, it’s normal healthy prolonged period time. government absolutely forcing people stay home, strictly overseas certain parts US lives severely limited. 

That’s propaganda. Look around you. Look what’s happening Australia. That’s reality. poor thing seems like would big news, yet Turkish website seems reporting it? Hmmm That's one things annoyed live, state second wave Australia. People got sulky lockdown masks follow guidelines. kept dragging people got frustrated, personally think we'd second wave people would right thing. Instead state lockdown many months 8 weeks stage 4. correct, data incomplete, mentioned that. mean unknown cases completely different causes, know. 

Doesn't really change question though, measures take? data points compliance important issue, can't really identify measures substantial impact data. What, classic. highly-acclaimed every Australian see Scorsese said, ""Wake Fright deeply -- mean deeply -- unsettling disturbing movie. saw premiered Cannes 1971, left speechless. Visually, dramatically, atmospherically psychologically, beautifully calibrated gets skin one encounter time, right along protagonist played Gary Bond. I'm excited Wake Fright preserved restored finally getting exposure deserves.""

Of course, would characterise calming uplifting, unsettling disturbing. would like 70,000 cases. Every time praise city, state country explosion cases within weeks. don’t know city live in. worldwide empirical evidence doesn’t support suppression strategy. cases local eradication countries locked early, hard, literal islands sealed rest world vaccine. mention, still suffered economic, social, cultural effects lockdown. (plausible) chance don’t get vaccine, they’re screwed. necessarily. least looked US perspective. took US example since users live.

There's several countries much strict responses ended much worse Sweden. US one them. Ha. No. Small change. care 'moon shot', try hardest reach optimistic target , certainly never get quick result. Good people working finding vaccine, heroes moment. Lots Florida men though! could also masks viral load lower. scientist i'm guessing. think type logic place sub like this. republicans thread? XD Pahahahaha choice. Govt still lockdowns cases rise, course mask reqs etc. I'm nomad travel country country. dont expect Ill able easily 2021 understand hard concept grasp fight airborne infectious disease things breathe air others, wear mask, inside others, keep distance outside. Oh, impression gave everyone? kind assumed got time probably gets tested often, I’m pretty sure others didn’t symptoms.

I feel bad security official. However, amount traffic goes whitehouse... mean every protocol place, nothing full proof.

Same goes American people... sure may assholes don’t believe masks... believe probably end wearing masks 99% time, cuz you’re allowed go anywhere without it. 

In beginning pandemic committed social distancing.. true social distancing, 3 months seeing literally everybody taking seriously did, also did. wear mask public that’s it. see friends now... people do. furious saw sacrificing everyone else, do? Isolate world keeps spinning? 

The keeping appearances thing... mean he’s president. almost rather what’s he’s done continuing show face disappear us. It’s vain, believe genuinely feels like he’s job he’s active, about. We’ve days work don’t anything literally nothing feels worse... imagine important job world; mean much isolation would really accept him? Ahh trick question, I’m realizing write, we’re socially conditioned accept anything him. getting Trump office, dumb ass. taking business away. shit ya'll say companies support BLM human rights movements. want way unemployment numbers. daily covid cases higher Florida even business shutdowns. Shockingly florida also. look county see cases quarantine kids teachers. quite true. believe version Excel using problem. 

The problem occurred somebody used XLS file format. happen version Excel, although obviously newer versions Excel default using XLSX. 

My organisation (also UK government central government health related) upgraded Office 2013 six years ago Office 2016 two years ago still shit load DOC (as opposed DOCX) files circulation. far fewer XLS files use still happens - templates people kept going old format years also horrible VBA based processes written people left years ago run year still spit consume XLS files. 

The reason I'm fairly sure PHE use currentish version Excel find files gov.uk going back 2013. look metadata files, list Public Health England employees/researchers (yeah, remove that). 

Anyway, get VBA property identifying version Excel used save file (ThisWorkbook.CalculateVersion)

I quick look couple test files guess (based shallow check)

January 2013 - Excel 2010 - XLSX format - 2015 - Excel 2010 - XLSX format - 2016 - Excel 2016 - XLS format(!) - guess would : 

1. Either someone fucked manually creating file XLS format, repurposed old file.

2. likely, they've got weird VBA type integration pulls CSV files they've kept XLS format initial use never imagined they'd hit kind limits. 

So someone made error that's besides point really. Excel used sort thing. say, work local government level we've done work Coronavirus covering thousand people. There's way would use Excel data storage even level. 

tl;dr - matter updating software. Excel database.  freedom contract COVID thought can’t transmit COVID family?? dont fucking understand there's ""health vs economy"" dilemma.

Here country (Philippines) government officials always discussing resume business service operations save economy, continue quarantine preserve public health.

What? Bitches fucking jobs provide support assistance health care workers, eliminate coronavirus short amount time, allowing economy resume again. hit birds one stone, preserve public health allow economy run again.

Context non-Filipinos reading comment: 90% public officials fucking lazy, including president himself. mass testing, contact tracing, strategies coronavirus, fucking effort all. ""strategy"" sit asses wait vaccine. Im making up. According president himself, batle plan covid19 ""hope wait vaccine"". Almost 7 months quarantine doesnt game plan yet, keeps saying ""wait vaccine"".

The president also appointed **military general chief strategist covid19**, instead doctor virologist. wrote: I'm sure Swedish option prove bad one. 

But analysis, may little better possibly worse United States, disputed massively horrendous response pandemic. mean either way comes out, Sweden's option terrible well? mortality rate say 1.5% means 5,000 humans die today. true 10% longer term health issues, that's 33,000 new people today deal healthcare system, less.

I think could agree masks would 338k cases. Even masks work 50% time, would save today 2500 lives.  I'm thinking maybe something mask business  oppressed. That's government feed cold war mindset. need prove anything you. believe whatever want. even helps contain virus. care. Everyone lost someone COVID....if person lived different country, chances contracting virus dying likely 250% less. That’s heartbreaking. Yes, virus also seems proclivity go types especially. post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* make sense. thing prevents non-China countries right stubborness, selfishness incredibly high volumes misinformation. Well, article it, ask authors ask me.

Edit: also, US population without fault. insanity masks, wearing wearing thereof, utterly retarded politicisation everything helping. interesting contrast Sweden, masks never recommended general public, nobody cares them, rare see anyone wearing one. However, also mass marches for/against, protests riots, recent things did. point turns Sweden gone better US, think becoming case, might turn incessant spam _oh God saw someone without mask!_ utterly ridiculous. Dude don’t know people seem rolling dice pretty hard now, point aren’t even rolling dice, straight throwing table That's government told you? Whatever.. Yes, good point, something pondered myself.

There multiple reasons suspect real winter comes going see much spread cases severe average (dried mucosal membranes efficient aerosol spread leading larger initial viral loads, seasonal variation vitamin levels, etc.). may major reason March horrible. 

And think anywhere close enough attention paid possibility. 

Right ""But CFR low"". live Arizona great news people US things too. flip side, victoria aus got shut hard case numbers dozens. think people decide accept risk go back normal 2021, doubt another wasted year. Umm, sure noticed, United States' response pandemic ongoing dumpster fire. I'd argue given U.S.'s advantages wealth, resources, technology, industrial capacity, infrastructure, research ability, may worst pandemic response world. 

So comparing Sweden U.S. exactly? joke post? lol 17? God... administration like thrown colosseum. ""Just World Fallacy"" Serene Republic San Marino concern idle chatter. Anyone know Peru screwed bad? know Latin America (hell America's general) hit bad. made Peru stand worse Brazil? Bolsanaro completely ignored single thing. I've walking around neighborhood I'm sad see many shops, stores, restaurants permanently closed NYC. world getting ready roll vaccine meanwhile, FDA going take *months* review data. Blood going hands Sure, deaths much lower people want roll dice lingering complications. vaccine's rollout true efficacy understood summer/fall. Public confidence ease social distancing lessen 2022 best case. will. worry.. people sub delusional. matter much facts contradict preconceived narrative, they're going ship america bad. look who's blind.. Wonder much generated fear virus. many people would shown hospital experienced *exact* symptoms year ago?  Whatever helps sleep night. president simply said February ""wear mask safety. virus airborne contagious"" would completely different situation less deaths. reported it? article never said. decline cases.
It's 15K tests daily 90% rapid 10-min serology test kits.
And health minister follows finance minister.
They told President cases low open everything back up. 
Nevermind fact health minister said tv interview ""nobody world tests asyntomatics asyntomatics spread virus"". incompetence less they're tired full lockdown. vaccinated mean immune(it effective everyone)

then what's point it? might well go herd immunity people going spend another 1 even 2 years this. Especially elderly vulnerable dunno still seems like government ploy Weird works... longest maybe, one least enforced. flu? You’ve got trolling. think allowed miss school flu? think I’m allowed miss work flu? You’re trolling buddy 
We would better government taxed arse companies making billions dollars profit selling commonwealth resources.  bad Karens won’t wear masks “iTs RiGhT!”
Yeah well shut TF want shit speaking thousands dying every day? bet something different say. Yes, NYC still got 0.33% PFR, counties Rio Grande Valley Texas got 0.2-0.25% officially (certainly much higher reality), much 20% attack rate.

The point mortality go linearly spread, hospitals collapsed, shoots dramatically. Peru, know much better me, reading watching, people hooked oxygen bottles parking lots outside hospitals yet others even get oxygen all. that's IFR goes sharply. US much resources, unlimited. Hopefully get find limits winter, way things going, may end testing the....... Crazy expensive unless given employer, usually crap coverage unless good job. [""I'm back perfect physical specimen I'm extremely young. I'm lucky way,"" Trump said. Trump, 74, clinically obese known heart take least...fucking moron 3 :P gather fabulous information?
Where reefs recovered year two? 
I assuming scientific papers published articles studies back claims up. Damn straight! realize approval rejection report nothing validity news article value. also ignores research shows mask wearing may potentially lead immunity actually fits notion perhaps ideology: far broad allow loose interpretation. mod.  past four years, culminating pandemic, torn many families apart. what? what... 200,000 dead long schools open there? haven’t seen much rise here. They’ve open northeast US 6 weeks now. distance rules mask mandatory

These become permanent part theater-going. Theres entire thread sub discussing bias countless errors article. Won’t go again, you’ll find days back (or search). 

As masks, changed stance time Denmark did. Danish government started recommending public transport seeing worrying rise cases (and extended mandate certain areas increase didn’t slow down). think we’ll see similar development Sweden coming weeks.  IKR wasting everyone's time hospital little case flu. big baby. Probably fatigue aswell, people cant keep social isolation/distancing anymore. Super misleading title. great, think next summer shows start opening limited capacity, don’t think extended Spain declared risk country germany, even canarian isles baleares. Many hotels spain already closed. That's exactly type thing call lying. dat vaccine tho Nobody snowflake contest China even communist anymore. right? Inside people's hearts.

Remember anyone claims pro life suggests need wear mask. Black Friday used be. lot shoppers know expect month-long online sales events now. Cases don’t mean shit, semi accurate number go deaths country completely honest. husband usually get Florida resident annual passes Disney every year. 30s kids. Lemme tell - sneaking booze getting drunk disney super fun. We've quit drinking since last Disney trip, yeah. called ""Drisney."" Ah, Michigan. wearing piece cloth face 20' walk table enrages Karens. generally avoid posting commenting sub, can't help say ones say ""We cannot survive another lockdown""

No, least people live Europe, prepare another one. although certainly bad economic reasons, things need sacrificed, like not.

Plus, may shot dark, know last pandemic right? although SARS-COV-2 nit generally deadly population, come time virus deadly Ebola fast-spreading flu, then? Yes technology probably advance wno knows enough stop it. option point lock houses wherever wait find cure potential disease (which definitely happen future, question when, 10 500 years, knows).

So, although see people think bad, economy infrastructure repaired brought back, human lives cannot brought back. someone dead it. 

Think want, think right... gonna cite anything cynical? think summer climate changes keeping virus check anything Northeast did. Covid19 deaths completely preventable.  know true data acquired past year mask use social distancing mitigated virus.

Stop.  Lying.  Honest god needs become criminal offense. Title misleading considering smashed **THEIR OWN** single-day case record. title makes seem like smashed worldwide single-day case record, way, currently held [India 78,761 cases 24 Protocols prevention good enough countries use similar protocols. it’s rising everywhere almost time... assume color? /s son waits tables Ann Arbor, MI. makes 2 bucks hour table, packs go orders.

Sure, slowed it. slowing made people feel safe. Like we'd won, something. agree. 

Lockdowns control peak pandemic. instituted March lifted since June Russia's daily infection rate shot included figures white house. thought already vaccine??? lol thought Russian vaccine hand crafted putin said "" we've flattened curve!!!"" never said that. Greek houses shitty. I’m simply saying vast majority locked well Greek life merits shouldn’t shut down. Schools reopened basically measures dropped start September, that's hit 5 cases-per-day records 5 days.

We've hit number consecutive records last days. 

All lockdown measurements practically ended start summer break. People said ""but already paid muh' vacation"" went vacation.. public swimming pools, gatherings shit people usually summer people year, too. us first half, ngl wonder. Look guy right wearing mask. aren’t many doses monoclonal antibodies still experimental unapproved treatment.

But, feel Russian people, suppose would felt German people 1940s.  religion showing biggest weakness, save one. 2984 tested deaths. better way estimate total deaths?

Illinois [12,600 excess deaths Sep corresponding infections 3 weeks earlier. comparison 8744 tested deaths September 23 (11 days Sweden says reporting delay is; nobody else tracks this). might estimate actual deaths 40% higher tested deaths - seen nationwide.

But also clear Sep 23 correct day looking at. would want subtract ~10 days time blood samples taken (time infection seroconversion), add ~21 days (time infection death). another ~11 days (time death reporting) using reported deaths instead excess mortality.

And then, course, there's possibility 20% may represent full population. say level detectable antibodies infection march may cutoff even test - likely scenario. also could go way tested population higher prevalence rest population.

Anyway, assuming +40% tested deaths actual deaths gives 0.7%, exact number dialysis study came nationwide (but case, almost certainly coincidence, since gave huge variation state). Sad true did, linking directly Obama's words. got that. Utah County cases, woop de doo. Salt Lake still crushing Utah County per capita deaths per capita hospitalizations.  


Honestly think cases great metric lot testing, etc. (also necessarily bad high cases, long turn high hospitalizations deaths, builds herd immunity little cost).  


So even ignoring unverifiable slander, Utah County much better Salt Lake County. still see masks lots places Utah, downtown salt lake bars clubs. anti-science facebook reading yokals. Unfortunately :(

Today 6000 7000 new cases tests come 31 % positive (that’s extremely high, signalizing real number infected way higher). Obviously virus going spread regardless ""two weeks flatten curve"" hospitals get run. know risk, encourage young healthy people live lives normal possible. sooner runs them, sooner reach herd immunity actually keep vulnerable population safer moving forward. Waiting another year two expense people's livelihoods education, networking, career opportunities, mental physical well vaccine may may work best strategy.

Get scientists explain findings virus changing (kids spread it, do, masks work, don't, survives surfaces 4 days, etc). Pit experts either side other.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Exactly. pandemic revealed unsustainable local culture is. need right long-term economic restructuring away in-person interaction towards tech. Laying hands doesn’t cure covid, helps spread it. Yeah, meant China almost every factor going (except fact outbreak least amount knowledge available). Government decisiveness, overall culture, manufacturing capability, major anti-science movement, etc.

Not needed though. Even Thailand our... ineffective government...managed fine public trust medical authorities. Even works 50%, rate transfer much bigger 1 (else cases would truly explode), even reduce transfer rate 30% whole population likely fine relatively mild measures. No, wrong. Avoiding testing improve death rates, anything makes worse people infection may isolate vulnerable contacts. India reasons lower death rates, eg. younger population demographics. That’s leader. Willing make hard choices protect nation. SARS vaccine never accelerated stage 3 trials virus burned quickly, left foundation research coronavirus vaccines scientists build now. thing MERS- never reached pandemic phase, again, lack incentives. 

no one ever said money magic, indicator directions/trends might see. We're likely getting better testing. people test, lower mortality rate catching non-fatal cases data. 4 wins NY teams . I’m sure stats worse body rights....unless woman. still think america lot mask compliant think compared countries.

it’s bias living here. masks pushed would reduced hit. President trump looked attractive navy mask. didn’t sociopath push hot hot navy freedom masks? looked good objectively America failing invest education decades

Youre using proof masks work, despite fact dont read ***the first sentence article*** see tonnes mandates implemented time, making absolutely impossible attribute wearing masks.

Not mention fact study, control group, measures different points covid waves.

Im saying masks dont work, using proof shows little people care something true not, long fits point view. - Gov.

I'm starting see pattern here... [guess what's best way know true toll epidemic pandemic look excess mortality; picture United States grim. indications already 300,000+ Covid related deaths states. Okay could taken chart two data points earlier said initial wave freak spike we've settled somewhere close deaths per week flu. Obviously still great we're clearly steady state yet, know could dip lower lower peak/valley, seems like positive way look things. article addresses half it. CDC table splits data preexisting conditions things covid causes leads death. reported table dumb. it’s 6% deaths comorbidities. Show doll Arizona touched you. know bring irrelevant bullshit detract fact caught spreading misinformation coronavirus, nobody falls it.

Try harder, thanks! Percent positive still hanging 5% ""About 20% said attended gathering 10 people time frame 16% said participated 11 social gatherings past two weeks.""

But that's still pretty vague. distanced social gatherings? people wear masks? I'm fairly certain bot still snipping posts judges ""political"" Trump greenscreen now, I've heard. He's sick even step outside minute. I've heard Saturday day 10. 

We might different discussion next week.

Chris Christie, military leaders, Giuliania - even Mike Pence red eye (if he's still irresponsible, asymptomatic aides could got super spreader event days later still spread Pence).

By election day, ""Rose Garden Massacre"" might biggest story play. Funny how, end, virus might truly big impact thought might world events. Indeed, see worst flu seasons worst heart attack spikes. top general thing wild temperature swings stressful cardiovascular system, going back forth heated homes cold outdoors affects things  seems odd. live Arizona yeah cities put mandate place. beyond sign front door building lot else done. anything it’s gotten worse last weeks.

Flu hasn’t eradicated. met people?  symptoms appear within 2 week period, it’s likely people contracted mandate...so real count would really start 2-3 weeks reflect impact. like somebody said, close family friends would gotten somewhere...it doesn’t suddenly appear home theirs... office one wears mask sans one guy, I'm one wearing whole fucking day. get frustrated I'm one taking seriously try pass health care supplier. trust work home one day week. Wtf??? low? built 5000 years ago. used advanced techniques time (techniques superior modern engineering). Alas, techniques lost us.

If someone risk tearing apart wonder secrets, though...a person could become rich beyond imagination.

I'm old wealth. want retire enjoy quiet life. I'll sell $50,000 yuan. I'll link Alipay below. Right? Hey guys don’t fear this! cure! Inside he’s like ha fuck I’m immune long I’m okay that’s matters. POS. hope okay. every medical professional scientist working disrupted whole species way life

But crazy thing...based statements made certain experts people subreddit, vaccine even enough change anything. even bothering? know people probably minority, really concerned public health officials politicians really going start pushing people wearing masks forever shaming anyone want to. even conspiracy theory point. literally experts saying that. Oh sure, say ""two years"" trust ""two weeks flatten curve"" turned 7+ month hell end sight, even vaccines horizon? Maybe anxiety talking, really starting empathize anti-maskers this. shit. It’s like scientist believing science seen counter culture country. God need change. Can't believe got downvoted literally universally human thing anyone say.

People exaggerate restrictions pretend worse are, say impossible restrictions are. see family regularly. Outdoors. Wearing masks. three sessions room fan. masks. get take out. live lives creative committed finding safer ways keep relationships going.


I need gather indoors groups ten masks order maintain relationships enjoy life. That's small thinking. Lmao could tell everyone america diagnosed covid won’t scared slightest. First all, first source cites second source source. FYI.

Secondly, good 65% Americans say wear masks, high potential social desirability bias impact results since they're based self reporting. top that, part reason people wearing masks cases disproportionately high here. There's reason wear masks people irresponsible countries. thoughts exactly scared stay home let rest us get back normal Ya don’t say. wave bans last two years, believe. usually happens mod team sufficiently ""prepped"".

No need argue facts logic could ban detractors crosses arbitrary line set convenience. trump alive due hand satan.


got it. Remember this? author. He’s SIP since March. 

“Ioannidis co-author controversial study, ""COVID-19 Antibody Seroprevalence Santa Clara County, California"",[29] released preprint April 17, 2020” wiki identified gene Neanderthals leads severe case disease. 

Africa fewer Neanderthal influence continent Neanderthals Homo sapiens didn’t interbreed humans moving Africa. 

I wonder could matter enough impact. knew masks would help lot, wouldn’t enough healthcare workers Kushner cronies stealing selling friends, Trump wouldn’t force companies make them. That’s told people stay home limit contact people. Lol literally don’t care. Older adults fucking isolate like lives depend it. I’ve stopped quarantining, won’t anymore. I’m gonna waste life. welding people's doors? leader care people supposed lead. leader sociopath. leader lacks basic humanity civility. GOP really messed Wisconsin. poor cows :(  Oh no, anyway. Yes, doublings locked already

Unlike many places Fall wave started ramping slowly, trajectory reminiscent seeing March. like 7 days “We get used wearing mask taking couple measures couple years, integrate daily lives, forget them, turn something useful you,” said.” 

You realize feeds anti-mask narrative, right? really sound like pushing people wear masks forever. people actually went along this, couple years like suggesting. would forever. got closer two years, people would saying ""well, we're wearing now."" That's exactly happened restrictions put place 9/11. happening pandemic. Everyone scared losing job able hang friends told suck wait vaccine. Well, vaccine horizon experts pushing goal-posts even statements like these. experts politicians really ought wonder people increasingly refusing listen them. jerk people around long get sick it.

The problem social cost mask wearing. harder empathize someone wearing mask. seriously wonder would social development children, particular. say big deal wear mask blue face, lot people is. wear mask generally pro-mask really frustrating pro-maskers literally feed anti-mask narrative refuse understand anyone want keep wearing one rest life. HAAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. I’m preparing shit. I’ll stop wearing mask whenever want lmfao. soon. Better suck small precursor compared climate change us next several decades, good old times... really. long children around family occasionally people outside family, get social development needed. people wrongly assume children NEED near peers constantly good social development, that's case. lockdowns spring continued zero cases virus eliminated. People businesses helped government accordingly, course, done eradicate virus done.

Except ""eradicating virus"" scientific approach. Absolutely scientist supports lockdowns virus' eradication.

Please get educated scientists saying ever since March: flattening curve saves lives, locking weeks spreading disease time (which locking eradication) saves lives. Like New Zealand Vietnam? people take President's advice. trust government all. still wear mask. lump jobs nut jobs.  already brunch places world sports already back attendance cases fucking idiot Yes, multiple posts this... use search feature Well yea. guess I’m mentally past ever possibility unfortunately. still can. outside. zoom. really good ventilation masks times food going mouth. PUMP SHIT DONNY!! LETS BANG IT! money Chris Christie. lancet also journal published original “vaccines cause autism” thing. 

So lancet said so, vaccines cause autism? Damn. wish didn’t spend time thinking stupid conspiracy theory. 61% dinner know. thought typing science, aware haha. went it. Can't sue?  head guys chance lead us safety, take initiative stop streets. reached upper echelons leaders, let happen. fault period. moron could locked us down, powered it, could like New Zealand right now. Every one 210k+ deaths fault. wish karma would buttfuck soul already That's ""science"" per se, that's existence. 

There's seemingly endless Rube Goldberg confluence variables, innate us outwardly, make realities.

The question asking is: world indeterminable multitudes predetermined variables constantly altering reacting every action, thought, inaction, actually freewill? ""Z"" needlessly complicated Rube Goldberg diagram? Holy shit, *strikingly* low actually Arizona let people eat inside restaurants too. Go r/coronavirusaz look charts look like. It’s George Carlin! famous comedian...  awesome!!! Ooooohhh scary !!! 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳lmao worst thing pandemic America fused politics. country, can't talk one without other. want straight forward possible, one grievance takes rabbit hole disappointment, frustration anger. Denmark, rose 400% mask public transport mandate. 


Not saying masks, probably trending without masks. actually opened article get better look whole garb. love it. Reminds Charlize Theron atomic blonde. It’s going available everyone time, it’s going gradual rollout mean current old people drafted, they're told live last years inside young people see care stopping disease spread? actually wish believed probably don't. hoped Europe better America. something went wrong there. Perhaps got cocky, complacent? belief always people push work democratic process face pure terror, willful-ignorance broken society. hoping Russia brought 21st century next decade, seeing inevitable fall brutal dictator Putin. excellent points though. Mask culture may stay, especially seasonal. confirmed, chinese actually died. pic saw photoshoped.

Now happy? problem this, sure third population never getting vaccinated.

So either drop restrictions soon it’s available everyone, leaving people’s personal responsibility get vaccinated.

OR require vaccination. refuse, jailed. Done.

The US seems always trudge middle never getting anywhere. blame bars restaurants much like. Bars restaurants opened since may 18th. Schools reopened 3 weeks ago. Exactly this.

Rules help enough people follow them. Tsunami wave stupidity. Russian here. always flex Yanks Russia covid treatment mostly free won’t bankrupt life poverty. whole system making waitstaff rely tips draconian relic robber baron ethic. Imagine restaurant charged little said don’t need tip anymore. Russia embarrassing us. number 1, them..

Ugh, everyone come library rally beat them. 831 October 7th - that's 17th highest single day tally since epidemic began. June 2 June 26 16 days higher single day numbers, based trend might couple weeks Sweden back numbers - considering FHM/Swedish government apparently nothing prevent it. definitely careful pats getting tats. true back march april spread specific area.
The numbers say 80% regions less deaths previous years, mostly lockdown (no car accidents example).

The problem way counted, could count everybody. Lombardy initial capacity 700 ICU beds increased 1300 covid patients (and missed lot covid deaths that) transfer ICU patients regions countries (like germany).
Now 360 ICU beds occupied across whole country. Hard miss covid deaths now. Mes parents habitent Dans la Aquitaine (pres du Bordeaux),

Million d'excuses pour mon francais, je nai pas beaucoup des Amis qui je peux pratiquer avec lady pandemic style. Putin essentially looked Fox News right wing talk radio America replicated Russia. created version right wing state media, complete blended right wing Christianity Orthodox Church.

It's wonder impact public understanding science same. Younger people make essential workers U mean medivac ride, everyone helicopter waiting around? problem theaters better movie experience.

Most people big rooms watch big TVs in.

You can't watch 60inch TV 100 sq foot room. guessing anyone old enough remember much shittier USSR.

Exactly opposite. Supporting Putin Soviet nostalgia go hand hand. younger people are, less positive opinion USSR less support Putin. 12,000 one day lot? I'm pretty sure per day Florida alone months ago. Covid-19 DESTROYS Russia INFECTION RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS I’m mistaken, actually one valves thought N95. Ive used lot though, filter need changed? Article: *the entire world infected died*

This sub: *20 “wholesome” awards* going thread, read whole thing. What's title lol news organizations treating covid like pandemic Olympics easy way keep social security solvent kill current seniors. ... Australia? Lmao puts Australia together Russia China omh Surely can’t hard mandate everyone wear mask entire population afraid falling hospital windows right? Russia must weakening population intentionally. School shooter love it! Someone correct I’m wrong, aren’t stories “new world record cases” see almost every day pointless articles? testing capacity increases every day, isn’t obvious correlation? would think people would concerned positive testing rates, maybe I’m missing something. I’ve tipped more, even I’m ordering go. seen video yet?
Let know agree statement Yep, people scared indeed wear masks.

Now scared, give fuck go intentionally guidelines. public health officials suggest part change mortality rates partly mathematical trick: people test, larger denominator positive cases lower mortality rate.

At peak Spain’s epidemic earlier year, example, Cantón said, 500 PCR tests day, it’s five times that.

“It looks like positive patients now,” said Cantón. “But diagnosis.”

Rinesh Parmar, intensive care doctor heads United Kingdom’s Doctors’ Association, agreed: “The amount community grossly underestimated. undertesting.”

Epidemiologists also look closely deaths per 100,000 people population. rate less dependent wild variations testing capacity, useful number compare regions nations. 

To put numbers context, infection fatality rate flu, Adalja said, 0.1 percent, making coronavirus six times deadly.

“I think people don’t realize small percentage big number still big number,” said. Sixty-five hundredths U.S. population roughly 330 million, pointed out, 2.145 million — 2.145 million potential deaths.

Two waves
The earliest reports less-deadly coronavirus came May 31 drew widespread skepticism. Alberto Zangrillo, head San Raffaele Hospital Milan northern region Lombardy, epicenter Italy’s outbreak, Matteo Bassetti, hospital Genoa, conjectured virus weakening.

Zangrillo provided first evidence viral loads might linked, stating previous 10 days, nasal swabs taken hospital Milan detected “absolutely infinitesimal” amounts virus compared previous two months.

The claims quickly denounced public health officials said evidence change virus’s lethality. time, scientists’ surprise, data borne falling mortality rates decreased viral load.

An Aug. 13 letter published JAMA doctors Houston Methodist, operates eight hospitals, reported huge differences called surge 1 surge 2 patients. surge 2, took place May 16 July 7, smaller proportion patients required intensive care (20 percent), compared seen earlier, March 13 May 15, surge 1 (38 percent). spent less time hospital (4.8 days versus 7.1 days).

Most importantly, later patients much less likely die — 5.1 percent versus 12.1 percent.

A broad analysis 53 countries regions highest coronavirus death rates identified similar trends. Published September Transboundary Emerging Diseases group American Chinese researchers, report found 80 percent countries regions estimated lower case fatality rates disease’s second wave. paper cited numerous possibilities might driving shift, including vulnerable already infected died first wave. theories involved better preparedness, younger ages infected favorable environmental conditions, including warmer weather.

“Current evidence remains limited suggest hypotheses plausible,” authors wrote. However, said classical epidemiological triangle model, states “the interactions host, pathogen environment determine characteristics outbreaks, rather one two factors alone,” likely holds true coronavirus.

Viral loads one mystifying aspects virus.

The widely available nasal swabs, PCR tests, give simple binary yes answer presence virus. scientists recently made new discoveries importance quantity virus people carry.

When comes infectivity, scientists generally believe negative PCR test, indicates basically viral load zero, means can’t transmit it. CDC originally recommended two negative tests 72 hours apart people came self-isolation. high viral load, hand, believed mean higher infectivity.

There’s less certainty viral load relates patient’s clinical course. Previous studies influenza tell us higher viral loads hospitalized patients generally associated worse outcomes. contrast, patients MERS SARS — severe coronaviruses — higher viral load independent risk factor mortality.

The new Italian viral load study seems support link novel coronavirus, too. found 373 patients seen emergency room city Negrar northern Italy, viral load declined March May, corresponding sharp drop intensive care admissions months, zero May.

In presentation scientists Europe last month, Piubelli, researcher Sacro Cuore-Don Calabria Hospital, surmised “lockdown measures impact absolute number infected people also severity clinical manifestations.”

El Zein’s study found direct evidence high viral load appears correlated increased mortality. findings considered preliminary team still analyzing possible confounding factors, differing treatments, see relationship holds. first week study, 25 percent viral loads high, half intermediate 25 percent low. fifth week, 12 percent high viral loads, sixth week, patients high viral loads.

The death rate patients high viral load group 45 percent, compared 32 percent intermediate group 14 percent low group.

El Zein said relationship striking went back lab check, double-check triple-check equipment, try figure whether anything changed procedures collecting samples, found differences.

“It definitely wasn’t chance mistake numbers going down,” said.

One puzzling thing, noted, studies shown children high viral loads appear completely asymptomatic, although levels correlate adults intensive care. Separately, new coronavirus mutation becoming dominant world associated higher viral loads least one study. El Zein stumped reconcile analysis others lower viral loads among recent patients.

As cases, hospitalizations deaths United States Europe ticked upward recent weeks — albeit lower proportion deaths past — health officials expressed concern overwhelmed slower sustained second wave. virus spreads back older people, many fear inevitable, death rates may rocket back upward.

Even Germany, considered model coronavirus control stood spring anomaly low case fatality rate less 0.5 percent, Health Minister Jens Spahn warned rate would likely rise. Already, 470 patients intensive care, double number month ago, said.

“People think virus isn’t serious got summer well,” said. “But that’s false conclusion. took preventive measures well.”

Spahn blamed increase lax attitude among younger population “want party, travel, think invulnerable.”

Across rest world, alarmed governments scrambling bring back restrictions haven’t place since spring: Paris closed bars, Madrid ordered residents leave city, Moscow told companies make sure least 30 percent employees working remotely starting next week.

In New York Tuesday, 100 public schools ordered closed neighborhoods seen resurgence virus.

“It’s matter time see rise,” said Steven Van Gucht, head viral diseases Sciensano, Belgium’s national public health institute. “The characteristics virus changed.”  working three months straight Detroit Medical Center, Said El Zein noticed coronavirus patients began arriving May appeared less sick came before.

More 4,000 miles away northern Italy, researcher Chiara Piubelli struck thing.

Rafael Cantón, infectious-disease specialist Madrid, also marveled change. “It’s totally different,” said last month falling admissions medical center, noting 130 1,000 beds full despite surging infections — huge change early spring every bed occupied.

Death rates novel coronavirus lower hot spots around world, even new infections accelerate may pandemic’s next wave. Scientists confident change real, reasons — whether last — matter intense debate.

“Is trend blip?” asked Joshua Barocas, infectious-disease specialist Boston University School Medicine. “Nobody really knows.”

The mortality rate coronavirus moving target since outbreak began.

Early reports China put high 7 percent. based mostly hospitalized patients, time wave hit United States, epidemiologists believed closer 2 3 percent. Now, factoring asymptomatic infections, well mild cases might part official tallies, Centers Disease Control Prevention puts mortality rate 0.65 percent.

Barocas emphasized even lowest estimates represent potential millions deaths. United States already highest number cases world recorded deaths country. Though 330 million people represent roughly 4.25 percent world’s population, country recorded 20 percent deaths covid-19, disease caused coronavirus.

Why it’s difficult calculate coronavirus death toll
As daily coronavirus death tolls continue increase U.S., factors explaining numbers. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)
As enter new phase pandemic, Barocas said, much country experiencing colder weather amid reopening workplaces schools, it’s soon confident mortality rates won’t tick alongside case counts, young people spread disease elders.

He called time “a cliffhanger moment.”

Public health officials cite multiple reasons lower death rates: note shift demographics stricken virus, younger people making bulk new infections. widespread testing capturing diverse range people illness, improved treatment strategies include antivirals steroids saving lives.

But researchers speculate may story.

One prominent still unproven theory suggested early research miscalculated humanity’s susceptibility coronavirus, slice population may partially immune, perhaps due previous exposure common cold coronavirus, childhood vaccinations something else.

The possibility something important changed environment — weather, behaviors virus itself.

Most viruses lose killing edge eventually, due lack hosts, mutations make less deadly, new treatments vaccines. novel coronavirus will, too, experts say, it’s matter many lives lost then. scientists doubt that’s seeing now, based genetic sequencing research.

One idea generated lot discussion recently, bolstered two back-to-back studies — El Zein’s another Italy, presented late September European Society Clinical Microbiology Infectious Diseases — social distancing masks reducing dose virus people receiving, resulting less-severe illness.

As El Zein doctors Detroit probed patients appeared less ill, startled find one indicator particular changed dramatically time: viral load.

Among 708 patients treated early summer, average viral load — measure particles virus body measured nasal swabs — fell almost weekly basis. infectious diseases, including Ebola, HIV/AIDS hepatitis, higher load, worse outcome.

El Zein saw glimmers hope findings: Could steps taken mitigate coronavirus’s effects showing success?

Monica Gandhi, infectious-diseases researcher University California San Francisco, shares view. initial viral dose — known “inoculum” — lower, theorized, people’s bodies able fight back effectively.

This “likely indicates ability control viral infection better, and, therefore, less severe disease,” Gandhi said.

Measuring death
Of many mysteries coronavirus, perhaps important average person risk death. smallpox, it’s 10 percent, thanks treatments. Ebola, it’s 50 percent. rabies, it’s almost 100 percent, making lethal infectious disease planet.

President Trump repeatedly talked coronavirus mortality rates, even claiming Fox News July United States “number-one low-mortality rate.” claims incorrect, according White House’s data (fact-checkers pointed chart looking day upside down). confusion underscores complex subject rates vary dramatically time, country, region, age factors.

“What seeing misapplication data statistics ends overtly false sometimes very, misleading,” explained Amesh Adalja, senior scholar Johns Hopkins Center Health Security.

There many different ways measure deaths. most-cited numbers — ones often released hospitals — case fatality rates, percentage deaths among confirmed cases. contrast, infection fatality rate typically estimate deaths proportion believed infected, including people asymptomatic mild cases may bothered get tested, would counted part official tallies. former number often looks scarier latter.

According Johns Hopkins University analysis, updated daily, case fatality rate United States 2.8 percent Thursday. compares CDC’s 0.65 percent estimated infection fatality rate — includes confirmed cases plus estimate may even know exposed. case fatality rate United States much higher South Korea, Taiwan Iceland, 2 percent, lower hard-hit countries, Iran Brazil. Humans created God per Bible. 
We need read Bible learn humans come from. 

Think again. social restrictions? guy 30 years. N95 great, ones valves -- see pic difference: Exactly. soon vaccine available average Joe restrictions need end. individual get vaccinated. rely infection rates drop restrictions, third country believing misinformation never getting vaccinated. Make available, drop restrictions, leave personal responsibility.

OR legally REQUIRE EVERY citizen get it, threat imprisonment. 

If wallow middle won’t get anywhere Yes, that's point. one side. Democrats Republicans two sides coin. networks service shitty. Yes, Fox bad. MSNBC. peddles propaganda derangement much, difference services different audience. Could point comment shows lack empathy towards Russians? mean, besides joke “those rookie numbers,” anything would show lack empathy towards Americans, haven’t seen one yet, maybe haven’t scrolled deep enough, case, scrolling deep usually shows weird comments. Red sus. thing stood article misinformation one:

""Swedish authorities actively discouraged people wearing face masks, said would spread panic, often worn wrong way, provide false sense safety. doctors insisted wearing mask work reprimanded even fired.""

There's difference encourage something actively discourage something. FHM encourage something saying recommendation, lot power behind it. easily recommend things.

And doctors reprimanded even fired totally new me, u/antsinthosepants pointed out. simply local missunderstanding.

But article made sound like doctors Sweden wear masks anymore something, autorities discourage wearing facemasks. rather big misinformation. would work too. Might need immigration rules though. west coast swarmed homeless people south, since take care poor arrest them. I'd love send folks back home state. Don’t vaccine? Winnipeg started school normal times spet 8th.. schools cases, spread (yay masks school). One school one case 7 shut went full remote learning. far ther 38 cases related one school 1 month later. Manhattan literally island dude Serious question- valid numbers comparing countries?

In many countries, tests free available.

In places like India, may free really infrastructure test.

In US well tests free, well doctor's visit co-pay $25-$50, poor insurance doctor's visit set back $300 $500- assuming find doctor willing take walk-in. Rookie numbers question publishing affect vaccine prioritization recommendations everyone reaction virus either Russia WIN ❗  deaths thee, hospital  reason Trump ventilator right cause Regeneron, Remdesivir, top notch doctors 24/7 care. convince them, nothing will. mean, lying hospital bed covid going fun. miracle vaccine!! Provincial positivity rate 2.3%. majority cases winnipeg.  Testing taking awhile get results people waiting 4-5 hours car get tested.  government fucked 2 weeks cases removing testing sites doubled amount test day 3000ish, negative results take 7 days.. Alot us pissed off.

The city surrounding area ""Orange level"" mandatory masks indoor public places group restrictions 10 people. Bars restaurants still open closing 11pm. 

They let get hand forcing mask mandate alot sooner.  Schools 1 case schools. One jr high cluster. 

But 2 weeks ago 50% positive tests bar/dine restaurant previous week.  need shut restrict capacity again. many people drive Signapore day? Claiming USA made working you? mods shills Trump. Obama centrist lol maybe smidgen toward left Sustainable Development Goals ask people, real people alarmists reddit, concerned virus. they, highly unlikely kill you. Restrictions already increased gaining traction sense urgency support kind shattering.

We need able discuss possibilities ethical virtue signalers want be. People voting actions want take risk. example like 70% say masks mandatory, yet less 1% wears them. vast majority thinks worn, WAIT, forbidden wear one. mean like mandatory people. Sorry realize hate directed Europe, joining anti US circle jerk. never said apocalypse. lag three weeks (if believe RKI numbers) deaths increased already, 5 per day 25 per day. expect increase line increase cases, order ""cases double, deaths double"". true far. Deaths get bad first wave cases get bad (adjusted dark figure, course) Infectivity doesn’t care feelings Came say that... outfit badass red mask white hair too. dig it. like United States collective independent states, shared body called America whose provides defense settles interstate disputes. basically idea founding. Utopia. much left talented people Russia. forced leave due lack security perspectives career especially business. New generations less chances build something good, due lack proper education (system fell apart long ago) lack technological production base country. every year worse.

Almost everyone still left Russia, give f*ck. Look happened Khabarovsk. arrested legally elected governor, placed kid, left people. matter many weeks people protested. media ignored them. Government ignored them. Mr Navalny team seems like ones gave full picture shitstorm corruption involved. surprise! Navalny poisoned. lucky coincidence.

Edit:
Let's say kind Elon Musk impossible Russia. still many bright minds, none chances environment built totally corrupted government institutions. Define “shot up.” hear kind phrasing tossed around lot, especially headlines:

Headline:
“CASES *SURGE* FLORIDA!”

Reality:
-Cases increased today vs yesterday today Monday processed tests.

-Deaths remain stable, hospital capacity good shape counties. specifically said want remain closed permanently decrease new art would new benefit Covid. people wearing masks even texas walmart/costco Thank  know hometown people really following rules. Students partying everywhere, social distances, barely masks... Trump: damn how’d beat us. Seeing 1 7 probably means dose set higher needs be. Things would figured Phase 2 rush phase 3, certainly worst thing could happened that.

I'd take odds option, personally. like cold war again: US Russia trying 1 eachother decent number Russian friends. parents support Putin, friends think he's disgrace. know dividing line is, I'm guessing anyone old enough remember much shittier USSR.

Putin's piece shit, dictator, terrible things say person, Russia immeasurably improved rule. Far less recently though, he's still coasting 1990's early 2000's. customer's asshole, also good reminder system service employee's salaries large part unregulated source basically depend society peer pressure, pretty bad system. articles? Trump’s leader “Operation Warp Speed” predicting 10 million doses available January — vaccinated, available all. That’s optimistic view. Trump probably getting scared competition. still testing would never report serious side effects Russians liars, default setting. Alright, let's play game. Three weeks ago daily cases Italy around 1400 average. sevenfold increase numbers summer. Since then, deaths increased, yes, doubled low number another low number. Even deaths increase four times cases three weeks, would 100 deaths day, 10% deaths last peak. Surely something destroy society over? Republicans stupid and/or lack empathy. nothing social media everything record, policy positions, ways business. 
 
Don’t chide people, makes look silly. Okay using NYtimes data posted 70 deaths 178000 cases .03% chance dying. 99.97% likelihood survival. 

It’d interesting see 70 health like got Covid.

You’re one eating propaganda plague everybody live life fear.

I advocate people risk assessment freedom make decisions based risk factors. live 2 people early 20s don’t work anybody age 45 see grandparents.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* come non-understander passage time. Good you! thought vaccine Pot meet kettle. sauce inevitable skyrocketing? keep seeing cases stack deaths stabilize. keeps y’all gonna back crowing “lONg tErrM EfFects” instead 😂 It’s almost like it’s overtaken inside promote shitty, unscientific information form sabotage. It’s definitely me. FDA hasn’t even approved vaccines yet.  literally sacrificing lives attempt satisfy greed parasite class. That's problem. Americans never get make sacrifices worthy cause. faith herd immunity, can't one without other! Score: treatment, cure, even methods transmission ascertained.

You failed Yes dig close schools age 15 (gymnasium, universities). closing physical access them.    Erm Russia like biggest country. say earth smashes n cases agree disagree! everyone. delayed inevitable. don’t want cases need stay locked vaccine distributed. Except hotspots Quebec apparently closing hotspots Ontario today well remains seen. Much better stick head mud. realistic time bleak, miserable outlook unfortunately. bet think Trump administration ""politics usual"" too? might. example, buddy Lukashenko lost election ordinary housewife, even 80% ""result"" help much. Definitely, combination demographics infected, better treatment options standard care lowered CFR. Possibly, lower innoculum masks/social distancing, different immunotypes (cross reactivity genetics) helped lower cfr, still much don’t know virus. Putin saw rise Rush Limbaugh, Fox News like copying playbook.

You assert given. explanatory power. 

People like time. weak associations head. ""A B sort alike, means caused B!"". trying expand globally longer alive. they'd jump chance use new media formats available previously nothing ""learning Fox news"". Putin showing trump done Like father, like son guess. yap. responsible lonely death people. 

Health departments trying best contain virus.  Surely blaming COVID first infectious disease around. bizarre policies health authorities let people die without family members. 

It Covid19 infectious disease, lethality new is. virus acting like typical upper respiratory virus. unknowns, best course action limit Surely PPE available families say goodbye. 

From start pandemic, PPE stockpiles limited. Manufacturing PPE also limited due needed equipment supply chain shortages. still hospitals US reuse PPE supposed one use only. still excess supplies allow visitation. Also, risk infection high enough visitation may exacerbate problem hospitals running far infectious diseases world, particularly continent Africa Ebola. 

Ebola pretty much limited Africa already vaccine it. infectious Covid. yes, highly infectious diseases well, lethal Covid well established treatments. saying opening schools necessarily good idea done, Zoom classes far ""very effective"" early elementary school students. may best circumstances though. need start acknowledging distance learning going leave huge gaps need addressed line. would much rather admit good percentage kids behind even best can, start talking correct open schools instead claiming distance learning works fine. lady looks cool af! 

Oh yes, bad bad stuff happening. Sure, customer asshole complaining health regulation everyone's benefit. 
On hand, tip given. customer want tip I'll looking book, thank you. freedom get INFECTED!!

woooooooooooohoooooooooooooooooooooooooo  think cases deaths never increased FL, point talking you. Open eyes, look graph much empathy American lives, ""all lives"", comes Russian lives empathy gone

Um... even Reddit year? Redditors celebrating rejoicing idea Americans dying COVID-19 since February. even reading things..? 

When Spain Italy hotspots, many comments saying, “Can’t wait hit US ‘muritards get deserve!!!”. finally hit US, entire threads filled comments like, “This Americans deserve bombing many countries.” course classic, “I hope Trump gets dies”.

There many articles posted Reddit claiming US going “over 75 million people infected”, vividly remember seeing comments like, “Good. I’m glad Americans perish, fuck them!”. miss that?

No humans country perishing pandemic there’s certainly evil hateful comments Russians here... insinuate it’s anywhere near bad Americans get criticized willfully obtuse ignorant. blind notice rhetoric that’s coming Redditors since March Americans dying. Well, get trashy news sources. Shouldn’t feeling 20 years younger now? Yes  still people wont care actual number Manhattan.  respond questions spite? wanted know number knew it. asked. single one required places using justice department (courts) police make anything approximating lawful arrests. None. Nowhere America people literally arrested mask compliance. law, suggestion. thought vaccine? expected “death wave” never arrives lol

It literally every single outbreak we've seen. 

You COVID deniers show beginning stages every outbreak touting nonsense, deaths inevitably skyrocket slink away weeks outbreak subsides show repeat lies.

It's predictable tiring. saw Princess Bride way. gave away foam swords nice neighborhood feel. bit overcrowded (since free event small outdoor setting) nice/comfortable nicest theater options, fun memorable. maybe colder weather DOESNT cause viruses outbreak...it looks way pure coincidence people inside stuff time. causes germs stuck them? need stay locked down. reopen deaths happen. Even vaccine takes years need stay locked save lives. It’s really simple. I’m Canadian I’m sick seeing posts comments subreddit we’re handling much better states. definitely all. thought alcoholism for.

Isn’t life expectancy men Russia like 58? flu IFR *not* 0.1%, that's CFR. IFR like .01% ...and vaccine! Womp, womp clearly hate freedom They're high demand, get booked repair window *before* someone mysteriously jumps it. I'm anti-tip, part social contract still tip least 15% whenever eat restaurant. People probably already looking reason ""justify"" giving tip. ""mask,"" would excuse.

I wish got rid tipping culture, entirely. Absorb tip costs menu price raise everybody's wages. Server wages would probably actually go down, cook wages might go up. skip phase 1 2 trials? Yeah lady vibing Specifically...? yah. really sad thing see many people utter denial anything happening simply REFUSE take measures stay safe. already pretty sensitive caring vocal cords - hopefully there's long-term damage Yeah. Lol that's point. lie, go full throttle Fair point [archive link anyone trouble accessing article government needs support it. economy could better shape pandemic quickly controlled. exact side effects reported American British vaccine. 

Put still trust Russian vaccine. familiar current state bi- multilateral trade negotiations? Canadian leaders openly saying future relationships (current) largest trading partner? know TPP-11 is? understand implications US manufacturers EU-Mexico trade deal? EU-Japan trade deal isolates even further?

After years Trump abandoning relationships closest allies, systematically cut global multilateral negotiations. squeezed decades global trade dominance distracted domestic affairs see what's happening real time. also, coincidentally, problem unprecedented collapse support among senior citizens vs 2016. really bet it’s eat buffet there, isn’t done yet  need lock fast.

Better economic loss loss life. next telling every firearm death caused directly indirectly China gunpower firearms originated there. come Florida like last March. frying pan fire... think even people good grasp stats would believe health authorities say masks dont work.

Politicians throughout Europe seem seduced Swedish model, ie sacrifice elderly convince population shame accident people accept death count treat like act God rather sacrificing Nana fat fucks bottom line.

To end deliberately giving signals people live normal blaming fatigue nonsense Nanas everywhere start dying. Really? see significant increase FL? significant increase everybody talking ago? American standards, sure, city, however big, surpassing tons different countries, something fucky Yeah, probably already infected point 😂 depends movie. huge blockbuster 3D much better theater. time go movies it’s something like Star Wars Avengers.

Honestly don’t miss theaters. don’t deal people talking pause movie whenever need go bathroom I’m home. select individuals like refuse believe science

Show quote i've denied science? I've argued continued lockdowns doubling mitigation techniques long-term plan straddling line harmful economic mental wellbeing still resulting virus casualties. pick one. covid obviously causing problems deadly. commen sense stuff dude. struggling hard?""

COVID killed 1M people annually 10 months clearly, deadly virus kills 1.5M people/year people even second thought even drag debunked old articles spread misinformation.

Only world CDC data adolescent mortality ""debunked old kids going teach go home families?

If way could open schools safely at-risk teachers staff protected. Perhaps could zoom chat TV screen teach in-person class help teachers aide? could also keep sick kid away Grandma, know, like everyone always done forever. Or, IDK, Europe doing. Instead took hysteria approach without actually listening science. Better stay indoors another year actually make informed choices, right?

People like continue come excuse excuse excuse even science blatantly clear clear risks are. bet wiped groceries clorox wipes Public health sends email media (or cases, redditors) sows panic:

“Cases increased .04% compared yesterday due backlog testing processing”

Becomes

“CASES *SURGE* ACROSS HEARTLAND, TESTING FALLS BEHIND” Yeah watch out, Putin might ""lose"" election lol. No, smashed cases early bought normalish summer. never did.  baseline got us now. 

Your “they testing more” perspective literally made USA sh**show. We’re freaking par Brazil India terms community spread.  Prior Covid would consider basically 2nd world countries yet comparable looking public community spread. I'm sorry happened you. feel everyone forced work amongst people care them. mom works hair salon retirement home. lockdown boss told take mask might scare clients. Nothing makes sense right now. People dicks Breathe News child's play.

It's really not. many Russian agents entire history Soviet propaganda get elected president?

Fox News old Soviet propaganda could dream about: turned entire Republican Party openly pro-Putin organization. forget people wanted vote Putin mistakenly vote Putin, graciousness corrected. clouds worst, deal cold sunny. Overcast weeks gets really really old Thank this.

Excellent read. know anything efficacy? Hey look everybody, random Redditor sitting Phase 3 data letting anyone else see! #India 60k cases per day !!!

*Ruski* , Pump number man !! dipshits wearing masks like guy right photo part reason why. even say begin always rare exceptions disease

There story several years ago somebody dying common cold - infection crossed blood-brain barrier. possible? Yes. one afraid it? I'd say, struck lightning. glad countries aren’t administered so-called immunologists like you.


Countries aren’t generally administered immunologists, Derpie.

And great barrington declaration nothing. released conservative think tank bigger ideologues are.

It doesn’t wide spread support among epidemiologists choose believe fringe nonsense want true,

Anyway. I’m done you.

Goodbye, Derpie. like 2 weeks flatten curve right? gonna waste life.

There lot ways waste life. Removing comments people believe it? Fuckin absolute joke sub is.

People saying believe removed flagged political.

China 100% hiding numbers. Uh: no. article doctor begging scofflaws state adhere public health measures. parts country least large minority resist so. 

Here Northeast deniers too, much smaller minority. observation, collectively getting hit hard Mar-Apr we’re pretty reasonable here. able go out/baseball games/go school feels like lockdown. No. cancelled annual pass. parades shows? 6ft apart line? line space mountain must go way Main Street! mask humidity? Zero enjoyment. Plus fact like zero immunities quarantine. native Floridian...not worth people listening software developer comes disease? Japan remarkable success containing coronavirus. Clearly helped boost confidence lift travel ban dozen countries. countries follow suit? 

I live Japan anyone thinks Japan great job saying blindly, severe lack testing. fuck knows really going on.

For example today tested 5500 people Tokyo, population 9.2 million (different Greater Tokyo).  argument possible. pointed lot things people think impossible happen. weak argument statement impossible Seems nice realize need test sample. saying obese people higher risk, they're adding overweight, lower BMI includes people. Americans, I'm mistaken. Would experts designed 737MAX? claimed safe?   including Mormons. belief systems cause adherents think somehow “immune” — applies rest us apply them. Amish Indiana problems reported August. think monitoring fleet movements something task satellites for? Seriously? things important that.  don’t think location news company anything what’s actually written news. 

@aykcak’s comment still stands. I'm presuming invaders would somewhat competent stop this. got weakest argument possibly imagine. Congratulations, spent 6 month lockdown save ~0.1% population. intolerable people certain things going on. 1 year university. fucking Zoom bullshit. intolerable. lot satellites, cost lot money, money would wasted mundane tasks like watching ship dock. actual spy satellites tasked monitor things actually happening, includes land activities. plenty things they've missed commercial satellite companies pick on. happened U.S. political figures mega-thread?  issue depending conditions, 1.5m enough.

I'd take masked 1m distance indoors unmasked 4m distance indoors day. What's prediction 7 day average deaths Texas 1 month now? Thanks source. That's disadvantage fast news guess, little time actually fact check. orange sus. AFAIK given extreme cases also lot side effects, nah. I'd rather take chances vaccine. know full context comment, believe either made poor choice downplay masks much, order mitigate run masks, considering impact people wearing masks thus believing need take precautions protected masks actually protect thus engaging risky behaviors.  
He recommend masks now, evidence like original post solid evidence well, around world, showing efficacy masks.  
Americans absolutely wearing masks right now.  
When say shouldn't, aware 40% transmission happen symptoms occur? Beh questi giorni sempre aumento di 800 casi rispetto al giorno precedente, se questo non è rapido non saprei😂 expect find 200,000+ wreckage brother What's prediction total number excess deaths February 1st 2021? whole science virology agreement whether alive not. Check example: mean, think distribute AKs Afghanistan Iraq? hard far less invaders populace. share videos? worries. 50 countries open US tourists. lot options travel.  confirm I'm sure everybody thinks something impossible happens. Germany lot things, since biggest country Europe. Kick American soldiers Chinese tourists landing beaches parachutes rather swimming trunks. Japan knows fuck US military matter what. satellites monitor every single ship every single fleet every single dock every single place every single enemy, like use anything else apart watching ships.

Just problem numbers. US intelligence agencies launched *lot* satellites last decades. Oh no.

I'm sorry loss. also lot ICU beds per 100000 people, European countries. Bill Gates' predictions 3-4 months ago? come true? low number cases achievement. gives shit long lockdown saves lives Well yeah 36k deaths covid measures distance place.

 deaths flu vaccine (but many italians do) still without distancing measures


the data homogenous work ICU ER largest hospital state Utah. we're seeing normal compacity. cusp ICU beds. Even could expand ICU capacity, problems staffing beds. sending patients smaller hospitals hospitals would normally send us. much influx patients (as flu season even close full swing yet) going problems. Got 18 like professional team finds 44 cases, nobody like find 16 5 seconds. Also, significant force catch US unawares land domestically,

Not possible. even remotely possible. small force good planning, intel, technology, lot luck *might* able accomplish it. force significant enough give us trouble could not. Lol, seriously? using Melbourne example? got second longest lockdown world Argentina. That's achievement. basing on? places like Australia coming flu season, flu [practically nonexistent Australia, August 2019, 61,000 laboratory confirmed cases August 2020, virtually non-season,"" said Ian Barr, professor immunology University never seen numbers like before.""

Australia pretty good public health guidelines general, relative lot areas, maybe got better outcome flu season. see predict year's flu season going ""hit hard"". could lightest flu season living memory? entire world already ""fight respiratory disease mode"" even started. biggest success China. first hit virus handled like champ despite population 1.3 billion. EU here, know healthcare kinda fucked US, but... even pay get corona vaccine? sounds fucked up. STOP.

&amp;#x200B;

you saying Mormons following non-mormon religion. ask both, think considerate blame entire religion different religion know teachings another religion?

&amp;#x200B;

**do think considerate assume Mormons even know teachings Jesus?**

&amp;#x200B;

What anyone keeps hating religion, literally definitely **NOT KIND** **INCONSIDERATE** neighbors. Read bible teachings Jesus. Jesus say ""bro literally neighbor knock doors""

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Mormon's follow Mormon religion. religion follows religion. Forcing religious teachings mormons? = mormons forcing mormon religion onto you. **You, true followers Jesus, kind considerate humans**

&amp;#x200B;

you forcing religion comments possibility propagate misinformation enabling others force religion others. cases I’ve ever read virus mutation follows path contagious, less deadly. 

Becoming deadly leads mutations burn shorten time period chances spread new hosts.

While less intense, leads additional spread hosts continue moving around spreading new hosts. e che si fa? bambini casa per due anni? dai su. l'aumento di casi non è un problema finche non è repentino e rapido e permette alle strutture di adeguarsi Right, let's listen experts. Faucci telling people wear start. trumps fault? predicted beginning. Europeans Canadians laughing US, look now.  want live world anymore. world whole, yes. certain individuals, no. There's ""flu season"" Florida. tropical climate part. Thought day, it’s empty , would suck wear mask day Florida heat, worth going cause one there? Also water wet. like intel passes president get going. Lets say intelligence agencies became aware impending attack. clearly they'd *brief* president, they're going tell military directly well, military going ignore something like even Trump directly told to. stated apparently underweight risk - relevant East Asian countries like mine more, something like 20-25% women 20s-30s clinically underweight am.

It interesting risk factors differ much society. think people complaining action putting mask
... think forcing people wear day. n95s hard come by. I’m Darwin amazed number backpackers still (many seeking farmwork) serious he's QUARANTINE?! somewhat agree disagree. 

Yes, Trump horrible leader amplified pandemic. poor policies bad leadership undoubtedly costs 10s thousands lives compared someone normal
was office. can’t hang whole death toll though. Even optimal
pandemic leader thetr would 10s thousands deaths.

Also, “if” lot work you. chance Trump infected gravely ill chief security given timelines vanishingly small. Sorry. Maybe you’ll able hang likely trumps fault death WH cluster runs course. Hopefully not, you’d much stronger case I’d you. I'm baffled people stress-baking stress-cooking stress-eating all? anxiety fear depression stress covid makes incredibly hard appetite, eating last thing want days. Ffs isn’t attitude problem it’s something requires constant vigilance sacrifice across whole population huge length time. delusional. Justifying enormous pain lockdowns saying work harder work like failed Soviet collectivisation programs looked good theory caused suffering millions. admitting we’re wrong path Utopianist dogma. road hell paved good intentions. mom, dad, soon, little brother (just got EMT certification).

This whole pandemic makes believe US blessed passionate healthcare workers world unfortunately toiling away broken system developed world. confirm: currently sort holiday would normally Bali Thailand Darwin instead Damn, one amazed people eat right - reaction anxiety stress spiral covid news I've completely lost appetite went skinny batch underweight batch. I'm force eat something although zero motivation eat.

I'm kind jealous actually... coping strategies may differ guess?  [Who could foresee this?](imgur.com/a/kvyhik6)

Original: [serio nie chce mi sie iść Fauci controlled Government? That's news me. Please tell more. different, opposite. 

you originally referred comment ""Deaths many covid children,"" edited say ""deaths covid children,"" later shift ""might covid children,"" ""non-covid *patients""* (who might somehow indirectly directly infect kid hypothetically kid hypothetically COVID.)

&amp;#x200B;

If think that, please write comment clearly thinking? thinking, add thinking. 

If wanna prevent misinformation, enable misinformation. Tactics changing *children* *patients* thing seeing social media transition use indeterminate terms Yes, absolute waste oxygen, people would prefer die.

Just dried booger instead brain doesn’t change that. I’m sorry you’re moronic, selfish asshole, maybe empathy you’d actually friends family care about. restrictions aren’t going work more. clear absolutely everyone now. Punishing everyone (ineffectively) longer people won’t follow rules one cruelest vindictive things I’ve ever heard advocated. It’s like abusive relationship blaming everyone/yourself abuser. EVen free? ""IATA, Airbus, Boeing, Embraer joint presentation"". Blatant propaganda then. can't talk, course tweeting bunch. pneumonia vaccine health conditions age recommended it: Ok, I’ll rephrase. social aspect/health crisis pandemic vulnerable vaccinated. ordinary person never want hear ever again. There’s way ends unless reach around 70% population infected infection rates slow. haven’t maskless public (everyone wears mask here) suffer bad ragweed/chamomile allergies. couple weeks ago started congestion freaked out. also get itchy break hives sun starts go down... get tested weekly well, still it’s like strange awareness now...

I mean happens twice year reason I’m self conscious. Like I’m waiting employer send home post nasal drip even negative test results. testing would easier less infections... ...so case numbers relevant support agenda, irrelevant don't? add 170 today. Tomorrow’s point higher today’s.  It’s discussed lot. computer simulation imaginary virus run Johns Hopkins. What’s solution then? else people believe in? Maybe Reagan right... routinely refer chart CDC sitting 12% expected deaths (average last years), ain’t great. Huh. mean like everyone knew g\*damned thing saying - shouting - months?

Well. getting downvoted lol PCR test standard means false positive cases trustful test. hope stays far away White House.  ‘I can’t breathe’ theme year. really get act together multiple areas... look two RNA vaccines, imagine approval happens month November. able immunize first populations impacted virus, November, December, January. Within period time, November January, enough vaccines immunize, would say, 80 100 million people, represents elderly people, health care workers, first line workers. that, start immunize less risky populations. look period six, seven months, November June, immunizing large number people, month month, every month, starting risky, impacted toward least impacted people.

Bravo! afford spend lot manufacturing it'll get job done faster. $20-25 billion vaccine funding stalled Congress right now. Slaoui light fire ass money could use. America politicized virus Quadrilaterals useful idiot them.

More like unstoppable idiot -- got 2016 Republican nomination among large field yahoos schtick caustically mocking people. read article? Even first sentence?  saw 75% drop new coronavirus cases state added local mask mandates.. 

Okay..  


But continues.. restrictions public events closures bars, gyms, movie theaters restaurants 

 
Im saying masks dont work. Im saying absolutely proof do. unacceptable part whole affair. military cannot afford top commanders getting sick. way worded friend was: imagine accident need medical treatment.

Hospital ultra-wealthy country could potentially save leg life risky surgery.

Hospital B extremely poor country removing leg save life try save leg risky surgery lose leg also life.

The Western World parts Asia Hospital A. potential save leg (the economy) still protecting lives.

The rest world Hospital B. try method Hospital fail HORRIBLY lack resources come realistic solution f\*\*\* economy number deaths.

Peru, Bolivia, Chile and, Ecuador (with Colombia, Argentina, Panama joining soon) everything ""right"" book horrible results extreme poverty + corrupt Governments + lack public trust leaders combination disaster. Hopefully let dominate Vaccines general BS far harm Show article helping.

On thread mask effectiveness? Either gaslighting, absolutely terrible conveying thoughts.

Covid harmless, healthy 19 year old sister caught last week hospital desperately struggling breathe. long term damage caused covid known years, harmless / well-understood flu.

Letting spread relaxing restriction cause hit us even harder later. vaccine developed, keep top it, period. Someone's uncle brother going get jealous. government nothing. We're fucked. phrase still applies, unfortunately people want eat rats try spite us. Guys! think may something here! actually one mask compliant countries world.

Source? don’t know, US correlation there. fair, large portion population back alright Germans; east coast, German American Bund, west coast, left-wing anti-war demonstrations Berkley 1938 urging peace Hitler. thought symptoms gone shoulda got trump’s medicine, coulda felt 20 yr younger mean total end year? article wasn’t exactly clear that. Get used it.

Some famous comedian quote goes something like ""the average person dumb. 50% people dumber average."" I’m gonna honest here. 

The CDC fucked hard. gave people opening. said don’t wear masks don’t buy them. weeks later said exact opposite. pandemic shit confuse anger people. Fauci said buy masks wear (probably due healthcare workers needing citizens) still got people riled confused. 

You give types conspiracy theorists foothold they’ll climb you. link actually post comments Battel, 38-year-old father two, put going hospital feeling chest pains. Sunday April spent day working house playing kids. wife, Cortney, said Dominic afraid went hospital would catch coronavirus...  died heart attack home.

His refusal go hospital nothing lockdowns lack thereof. free go hospital, chose to.

With fewer restrictions, California would larger infected population. event, hospital refused visit may space even chosen go.

Including article serves prove opposite point. I'm finding Administration coupled pandemic effect many relationships. like user name way.

Kudos efforts reconcile even though turns initial instincts correct. always know complete person explored option reconnecting. Wait, masks help? paid doctors right? 
Sarcasm aside, hope rest states follow suite tolerance policy like huge ethical problems infecting people deadly pathogens. COVID challenge trials yet even healthy, young volunteers. 

There's absolutely point suggestion anyway. would purposefully infect virus? concerned it, take chances society said. get zero benefit purposefully infecting yourself. Tell bridge Yeah feel you. virtual game night friend girlfriend him. Made realize first time I'd talked woman related me, coworker, employee store I'm 7 months. miss meeting new women, flirting, chasing, overpriced first dates, whole 9 yards. sure hope Trump counting Secret Service help keep building he's voted term ends. sure - remember started, feeling like Utah bad place ride out, things considered. course, believed Cox Herbert going continue like...lead something. hopeful. wrong. incoherent raving lunatic. Get help. Yeah, real number likely 60k+ deaths least. Many hospitals around country collapsed peak pandemic, completely ran simple ICU beds, oxygen, medicines, tests health personnel. dire situation, people dying streets homes get medical attention. 

On bright side since August number overall weekly deaths declined 2019 levels October, number hospitalizations declined 14k+ 6.5k past 2 months, deaths also declined half, number patients ICU also declining slowly steadily since mid July. New Zealand. 

Well, except part lock inside again, *because came back*. we'll get Finland. Norway. South Korea. 

This one, I'll give you. still [outbreaks regular despite closed borders mask fetish, we'll ignore those. Totally Hong Kong. want call normal? OK, guess tearing apart mass protests, anymore, sure, we'll count it.

(...but pay attention [that big July August...that's Singapore. 

They've struggled [multiple I'll give one. They're OK Vietnam. 

Only they've kept draconian restrictions place. soon lifted them, [the virus came roaring I'm sure happen again, course. thing repeatedly expecting different outcome...what call that? Sanity? Oh right...*""safer together""*. forgot. Must brain Or, know, China.

I believe anything China reports, OK. believe cases truly zero, bridge sell you. can't prove otherwise, because, know...communist state severe measures? NZ one laxest measures since reopened May.

Are kidding? shut Auckland *over month* [grand total 29 *still* know virus came second time. Even *tiny island nation closed borders* can't keep damned thing out! I'm sure *that* again. Totally got time. Pinky Even 'lockdown' Aug, restrictions group size limits 100 (and 10 Auckland). 

Their ""Level 3"" lockdown [about severe New York Everything closed, travel restricted, people stayed home Masks social distancing unfalsifiable beliefs: cases go down, worked, go up, hard Yeah, funny trend actually mirrors real life.

Yeah, [it sure looks like hell They're obivously [all completely I'm glad daddy Cuomo kept us safe *that* hellish idea always posters like peddling false narratives. respond defend misinformation? Doubtful.

Yeah, people like me, pesky *sources* *facts*, spreading scary propaganda. We're worst, right? least Packers basically said ""no fans allowed guys get damn act together"" Flagstaff checking in. tell PHX weekends based mask use. saw pretty bad spike Labor Day despite local mask mandates.  would someone conspiracy call new world order? judge small portions population media loves focus get people clicking get angry talking entire populations.

Americans compliance masks greater Nordic countries. he's scared, always crawl back shell! lied.  fucking thing. also don’t support chick fil either. Years done yet either.  Management nice corporate made dogshit decisions cut hours constantly *shocked pikachu* Ignorant fool. nothing open, else left sit home? 

The fires California kept people inside even usual. science says people get sicker inhale viral particles. follows serious symptoms likely infectious. person definite candidate. 

Also note, severe cases likely passed someone live result confined space volume viral particles air environment. thought that’s conservatives always preach. Don’t like business? Shop somewhere else! that’s true choose support trump supporting store? major “Get Out” vibes ....are green apples sick? Arizona resident here. think Arizona model actually great one look fight outbreak. Holding Arizona example one actions administration I've actually agreed whole crisis. 

I'm saying whole covid response Arizona good - fact clearly disaster first half so, leading one worst outbreaks world. fact, even successful response outbreak really great, think that's makes important observe. Arizona take world-shattering actions fight virus. early July, become single worst hotspot covid face planet. 4-6 weeks later, basically back pre-surge levels. massive success. do? Really, really much. closed gyms bars couple months got mask compliance like 10% maybe 70%. That's it. lock down. fine jail people. close businesses. shelter place. none that. Debatably gyms never even needed close either, since far know one's ever actually put together evidence gyms particularly problematic. guess days would maybe need close school downs well, obviously school problem July-August tough make call that.

The reason important example look shows easy actually control virus. need wreck economy ruin millions lives. need destroy everyone's mental health cause protests unrest. Literally close fucking bars month two mandate/enforce masks businesses, go #1 hotspot world totally control matter weeks. SERIOUSLY hard. think point trying make people afraid widespread closures implication going risky. AFAIK 10% figure comes averages worldwide antibody testing, seems significantly higher known estimated positive cases.

If look positive cases/deaths now, vs positive cases/deaths April, must magnitude higher level cases generate death, unless managed hit susceptible people (which seems unlikely), become less deadly (also unlikely) really. make trips always plan visiting one place it’s total waste. first case. Weve seen cases cats getting virus uk (don't know animals though). Sad. rip kitty Covid units generally separated completely. They’re put regular ICU (or regular ICU non Covid UCU patients moved new unit) created Covid ICU sealed rooms. NYC overrun, hospitals duct tape plastic sheeting ceiling floor Walton wall seal off. Hopefully nothing like happen developed world (very last resort) option others. Fake news expat son florida assure you, kill florida make stronger. Pretty interesting guys approve posts like censor Barrington report signed 25,000 scientists. Republicans/Conservatives scum

There excuses anymore reasoning someone suffering domestic abuse. sure wasn’t shit management team? anti-maskers: SEE?!@?!!!! 100% drop u dumb science mofos!!!! pneumonia may caused covid. We’ve seen number measures employed perform expected. don’t think it’s unreasonable ask one them. need study mask, study spending millions dollars plexiglass. 276 1576 people ever taken antibody therapy. seen contact tracing studies far fomite transmission seems low that’s good right? : 7 (5 foreigners)

 course largest group people bringing Covid-19 Korea U.S. ones protest. percentage general population 30, 40 50 without comorbidities? Hypertension comorbidity latest definition 31% Americans it. Obesity 38% on. That's misleading title. article talks people delaying medical care due fear catching virus. PSA go hospital experiencing emergency medical symptoms like chest pain. headline keeps going around, upper limit -- 'up 10%'. take run pushing agenda science. Denmark implemented mask mandate public transport, covid-19 cases increased 3-400% compared previous month.  


Statistics alone tell entire picture. either masks? running crowded mall? gone many hikes, went lake walk trail weekly without mask. try avoid racist shitholes, know arizona met. One first business meetings ended CEO praying jesus making disgusting comment Jewish people, there's that. wish even worst story had. 5 years I'll never get back. 

Honestly straight fuck arizona right dumb hole rocks. state always one buy conspiracy theories

Imagine religious people inventing conspiracy theories things exist. Depends live. live Atlanta go it’s mixed bag masks vs masks, neighborhood vocal active anti mask movement. What’s sad people leading people lot money influence city state. Nightclubs packed wall wall nightly people large parties. Bars packed football. parts city hear good masking up, family done store runs said suburban stores well. Personally know seen heard feel ATL mixed bag, metro well, way outside metro rural areas it’s free all.

Trump, said thinks he’s longer contagious. supports finding low viral load system.

Animal minds: pretty face

MOST people dismiss fish dim-witted pea-brains spend day swimming around doing…well, nothing. Worse still, others believe that, like Dory film Finding Nemo, fish 3-second memory span doomed perpetually rediscover joys fish tank goldfish bowl. culture social engagement – forget it.

Yet great fallacy. Fish intelligent appear. many areas, memory, cognitive powers match exceed “higher” vertebrates, including non-human primates. Best all, given central place memory plays intelligence social structures, fish recognise individuals also keep track complex social relationships.

The widespread notion fish stupid partially grounded traditional reading evolution. According this, fish primitive vertebrates evolution progressed gradual linear gradients, fish amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals primates humans. “higher” species, complex brain structure, intelligence behaviour. primitive vertebrates relatively simple neural circuits behaviour primarily automated innate. end scale, humans sophisticated neural circuits capable performing complex cognitive tasks.

But perhaps another, deeper reason prejudice fish. Humans lived side-by-side many terrestrial creatures millennia. shared environment bonded domesticated them. 

We think understand dogs, cats horses see, feel think, positive emotional response developed empathy. Fish, hand, cold slimy. live world biologists started understand. Scuba gear widely available 1960s, even today people experienced life underwater. hope relate fish haven’t faintest idea world like?

Having spent decade studying fish, feel must champion cause. facts. Fish existed 400 million years, inhabit every imaginable aquatic niche, show diversity unparalleled vertebrate group. 28,500 known fish species, species vertebrates combined. ample time fish evolve complex diverse behaviours befits multiplicity lifestyles – plus cognitive hardware go them.

Rather viewing evolution linear progression increasing complexity, modern evolutionary theory views various vertebrate lineages highly diverse groups forms specialisations. groups occupy less parallel lines evolution, radiating common ancestor hundreds millions years ago. Rather highlighting differences, comparative psychologists, behavioural ecologists neuroscientists increasingly uncovering huge degree similarity groups.

Over past 10 years, number research papers fish increased dramatically. decade ago James Kieffer Patrick Colgan Queen’s University, Ontario, reviewed learning memory fishes single short manuscript (Reviews Fish Biology Fisheries, vol 2, p 125). able cite 70 papers. recent issue Fish Fisheries (September 2003) devoted learning, cited well 500 research papers. introductory chapter described fish “steeped social intelligence, pursuing Machiavellian strategies manipulation, punishment reconciliation…exhibiting stable cultural traditions cooperating inspect predators catch food”.

That’s starters. Recent research uncovered fish species use tools, build houses and, all, impressive ability long-term memory. allows maintain complex social relationships, even gather information eavesdropping others. example, species fish search prey emitting pulses electricity home successful foraging pulses emitted individuals snaffle prey. structure fish brain varied rather different ours, yet functions similar way.

In 2001, published article Animal Cognition (vol 4, p 109) discussing long-term memory Australian freshwater rainbowfish. fish trained locate hole net approached length fish tank. five attempts, could reliably find hole net. 11 months later re-tested ability escape undiminished, even though seen apparatus intervening period. bad fish lives two three years wild.

In series experiments, colleagues shown larger groups learn avoid net faster smaller groups fish shoal learn observing one another. Social learning opens door transfer information individuals generation generation. cultural transmission lead development stable cultural traits. instance, several species coral reef fish “preferred” migration paths feeding resting sites shown culturally transmitted.

Clearly fish also rely memory keep track social structures. example, fish watches two others fight, gathers information contestants’ social ranks also establishes rank relative combatants. Many components aggressive displays also used attract females. two male Siamese fighting fish fighting, displays contain many aggressive elements, like nips chases, female watching, lads alter repertoire make bit sexy.

Many fish build nests rearing young birds do; others permanent burrows preferred hiding spots. cope constantly move, looking food? Rock-moving wrasse build new homes every night collecting bits rubble seafloor. construction complete wrasse settles sleep abandons dwelling next morning.

Other fish use tools foraging. Archerfish fire spurts water dislodge insects, species crush sea urchins rocks. grazing fish tend well-kept gardens constantly remove unwanted algae encourage growth “tasty” species. fish, however, turn less reliable relationships food supply. Cleaner wrasse eat dead bits skin parasites bodies fish. wrasse nips client’s skin, client leave find another, careful cleaner. wrasse’s best interest entice client back cleaning station. this? nice back rub seems trick.

It clear fish visiting cleaning stations keep track best stations are. many studies showing fish fantastic spatial memory, equal respects vertebrate. can, instance, form cognitive maps use take short cuts one location another, navigating via cues polarised light, electromagnetic field, sounds smells, visual beacons landmarks.

Despite amazing feats, fish biologists long way go convince public fish intelligent. First, must impress upon scientists modern view evolution. must reverse hundreds years prejudice. Fish may seem quite pathetic flopping around deck boat, get world you’ll soon realise remarkable  Garnish   worldmeters change time day resets? notice still going time typically resets now. group made prediction IHME hasn’t gotten predictions right whole time. surprised.
Gov absolutely nothing except wait-and-see put half-assed rules completely ineffective. 
At time they're still spreading misinformation debunked back March-April, even *lowering* measures fines despite numbers going explosively every day.

At point can't trust leaders anymore since clearly best interests heart instead next election, best individuals.

It's really sad state truly expected better country known ""levelheaded"" people, instead right worst reality-denying scumbags.

NL developed country world still bleating children literally immune despite every evidence, including own, shown otherwise, masks work worth it. 
I wish people charge would held responsible kind incompetence/sabotage. Lol try living literally anywhere South 56,000+ new US cases today new cases single day since Aug 14. doubt closures anything masks sure. I've Arizona plenty times pandemic balls businesses open well mask mandate. Ya agree following pattern flu does? first wear mask protect people.

Now wear mask make feel ok?

Since got feelings important freedom? fewer* Oh, agree completely! just.... beyond next level. Even next NEXT level. I’m anxious election outcome Yes. taking argument extreme, useful tool discussing ethical problems, especially science. situations override sacrosanctity body (Autopsies), there's line people feel uncomfortable fine (organ donation without family approval, donation body research), there's point 99% us say no, little good may come worth violation (Harvey Corpse Fucker).

This important discussion biology, historically pursuit knowledge deemed important person's agency. Henrietta Lacks classic example, millions discoveries made tissue worth giving informed consent tissue biopsies used way. think basing current numbers, how'd get 1 mil? live Utah right now; it’s crazy people believe here. can’t stand meet someone seems educated rational, soon conversation mentions anything religious political (for reason wearing mask political here??? I’m confused) turn different person entirely. suddenly refuse listen reason science world get them; won’t hear anything contradicts already “know”.

I live Utah don’t want generalize say Utahns trash, it’s surprising one takes COVID seriously here. I’d say solid 50% (at least) people I’ve met either part MLM, anti-vaxxer, judgmental religious zealots. Yea forces breathe back MAKING SICK dumb dumb... /s never claimed that? Please, check transcripts. said 10x. 26x talking recent Influenza season. Even ever talking “deadliest week” either disease.

And do, apologize!  they’ve convinced 2 weeks make hill beans difference safety trials. forget half COVID denying, citizen endangering, Bobbsey Twin Governors. 

I hope government state starts taking seriously ignoring DeSantis. sorry gotten bad. liar. know you’re immensely misleading. Claiming Covid 100x deadly flu lie, stupid lie makes laughable. care personal convenience lot people"".

LOL everyone does. Politics replaced religion become ones identity. “my side” believes believe it. People can’t pick chose feel certain topics. It’s either one other. Private businesses free enforce it, regardless state county mandate. That's good, contactless check-in? one else make pay reservations Facts. people saying ""well wait enough people get vaccinated wait leaders let us know"" need stop simping hard government. People need TAKE lives back [throw away soon vulnerable widely vaccinated, people like Spanish virologist motherfucker going keep shifting window acceptance towards restrictions forever. Fuck that, hate shit, want normality back, need learn live this. what’s solution heard immunity, based current mortality rate COVID19, would achieved 1,000,000 Americans dead. Washing hands wearing mask seem preferable. Ask Questions ComORbiDitIeS wonder gyms closed. virus kill lats! Gov Evers tried lot, everything stopped republican legislature lawsuits surrogate conservative organizations conservative majority wi supreme court False. look deaths actual day death last 7 days total actually 65 deaths lower previous 7 days. say that? since people asymptomatic

You know asymptomatic people still spread virus, right? kind miss magazine subscription. Used read time kindle. Maybe subscribe. Yeah America becoming completely stupid. zero faith left country whole. underestimate greed corperations sales teams, zoom meetings ""safely black friday"" gyms bars closing too. one really wore masks mandate clubs packed weekends forced close again.  live one wearing mask?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Imagine tipping always put line shit. Yes, like PS5 coming november 12, people wont able get one probably weeks after, people money, get lucky able get one. take moment consider public health implications. Outbreaks prisons, since happen fast, overwhelm local hospitals much quickly might happen normal conditions. Also, since prisons often located rural areas, seed cases resource-strapped communities. really. 

Over past 14 days Europe, [cases per capita Sweden lower Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, France, United Kingdom, Iceland, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, Denmark, Croatia, Poland. (Sorted highest lowest.)

14 day deaths per capita lower Romania, Spain, Czechia, Malta, Hungary, France, Belgium, Bulgaria, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Croatia, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Austria, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Ireland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Denmark. (Also sorted highest lowest.) I'm basically saying transgression mine pointed stupid dumb one I'm calling on. Simply put, Turkey lying. economy shambles, rely lot tourism. They’re keeping numbers artificially low borders open everyone try keep economy, that’s already tough spot, collapsing. Hope concern sentence positive combination. *smeshes good data expect northern hemisphere winter? 

We coming winter australia exactly lose control point USA much europe doubt much help. (nor NZ) appreciate see overall points. I’d like know also understand overall point. 

However I’d like note however vain trump may be, secret service agents voluntarily swear oath never leave side. note, president leprosy agents would still consider honor stand side. 
I feeling agent feels resentment trump, fact probably loves him. Remember humans work together everyday, despite whatever news may us believe, feel like employees whitehouse cordial, also absolutely love work there; would I, administration. 1.1 million average tests day. testing 900k/day India peaked 97k cases september 16th. Since 7-day moving average number tests/day increased 10% 7-day moving avg new cases/day fallen 25%. official. Broadway remain closed least June 2021, possibly even next fall.

They made *right* decision. safe open theaters right now, especially cases rise everything. 

Now, know lot might thinking overturn vaccine distributed quickly properly, on. ruling seems hard definitive, realistically, like not, **there *no* way reopen Broadway 2021**. Broadway unique among businesses takes *lots* time (several months) prepare show, whatnot. much easier cancel shows magically start holding again. such, it'll probably one *last* businesses reopen - certainly 2021, quite possibly even 2022!

For worth, think pandemic might end killing Broadway all. longer Broadway remains closed, less likely roar back eventually. possible going find alternatives Broadway dust settles, part ""new normal"". We're going back ""old normal"", remember?

Don't wanna believe me? advised grounded comments various experts. Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Offit, Spanish doctor, Lancet caution quick speedy return normal.

I know, sucks, would rather see show one night spend rest life ventilator?  40% U.S. population basically Florida man though. opinion? want go busy bar resigning catching thing. Unless outside distanced seems like brainer.  Reverse psychology. right-wing preppers wearing masks start pandemic. left politicized right flip flopped. 18 months we’ll start calculating true effect pandemic, considering excess deaths. interesting see. remember images Wuhan. Actually, 3 times. 8800 cases per million Russia, vs 24000 US A. Lol hopeless Official statistics Sweden FHM (Dept Health)  


and Social Dept different ways counting deaths, (FHM) according positive test according cause death (Socialstyrelsen). differ much.

But OP also using cited sources Press Conferences streamed SVT (can seen youtube, Swedish). SVT state TV channel. No, shouldnt go Bar, know sucks, next summer everything back normal, get shitfaced want mask. cannot believe AIDA plans make cruise ship tours mid october. Many people cancelled flights hotels closed still wait money Tui Lufthansa. Travelling within germany may get complicated every state rules quarantine. fuck standing way? posting Reddit? FOOL! scheme much greater us works. pandering worlds elite like many flocks sheep.

I’m Canadian btw changing wording forgot change ""on"" ""and"". 

You really think comparable? ""Wow, guy actually thinks 'on' used place 'and'""? 

No, don't. start seeing 3k-4k deaths per day, would hard ignore. 

I agree won’t / wouldn’t follow it, hope 70%-80% would - really depends bad gets. think rational time reopen vaccination levels reach think herd immunity threshold (~70%). think surges cases point would blunted impact, get level it’s equivalent bad flu strain, think would total game changer. PRC lied months virus. They're still lying. clearly idea many 200,000 single disease is, even people taking least somewhat seriously, even million infected far. entire country get infected, millions die. argument saying kills old people fucking stupid, Yeah,

It's worse loonies think they're normal. 🤫🤫🤫 spanish flu. We're likely going one maybe several vaccines available end year beginning next year. It'll obviously take time get enough people vaccinated herd immunity threshold--I seem recall Dr. Fauci saying Q3 2021 could mistaken--but that? seen single compelling argument continue measures currently doing. I've seen lot ""suck buttercup"" type arguments, though. need microchips track people cell phones 30 years point.  zero application vaccine. fair recollection (in UK), masks heavily advised beginning, slowly said may possibly help, mandatory public transport, shops, etc. So...? Deaths also consistently 170 range well...which means it’s still fucking spreading badly. Sure, maybe we’ve reached “peak” spreadability, also know aren’t many tests, hospitalization it’s mostly young people getting it. young people DONT GET FUCKING TESTED. want know know? 2 coworkers sick, instead quarantining getting tested, said “it’s probably cold. It’ll fine.” said that. 19. 

Kind irresponsible don’t ya think? interacted someone immunocompromised? yeah, hospitalizations down, testing, age people who’ve gotten it. Young people think “I’m fine it’s probably nothing.” It’s fucking stupid. US, [cases dogs hundreds far know. USDA keeps running confirmed cases animals seem report animal deaths.

The CDC keep pets healthy--basically treating human letting contact anyone outside household. Yes, Russian government makes lot fuss political points. read beyond pompous headlines, learn preemptive registration August, phase 3 trials currently underway, mass production expected earlier 2021. live province Nova Scotia. 2 active cases, people came away followed quarantine guidelines, avoiding community spread. One people ended intensive care. consider this: population 900,000 2 cases. Two. locked hard early, mandated social distancing hand washing wore masks. bubble glorious. Business back track anti-mask bullshit virtually non-existent leaders followed science use mask wearing political tool manipulate low IQ goons. AZ drop happened simultaneously mask mandate, there's least reasonable explanation They’re “doing really well” don’t test much Sarcastic-Fun-Fact, Florida 100% US. Yep  Yeah, gotta wade already disastrous election cycle think fun coming back In. India per capita deaths low 10th America testing lower America. Delhi live death rates per million half USA testing per capita also half America. 
Trump right test less get less cases

Even within Africa look country like South Africa relatively good testing math.  isolated self sufficient island nation low population. New Zealand approach impressive repeatable countries. we? - theyre also tyrannical totalitarian oligarchy Based false. approved clinical trial. Seven girls died halted test. investigation found 5 died completely unrelated causes. 2 undetermined likely also due vaccine. go India they've already working India years still working India today government wants there. halted one trial. Stop spreading dumbass conspiracy theories. remember doctor saying weird surge flu. yet done far address pandemic Trump administration has.  way Gates wrong? Dr. Tam okay best. Dr. Henry refuses mandate masks. Actually NE crushed early (for US deaths/pop, NY, NJ, MA, CT, RI still hold 5 6 top spots), compliant public health safety measures. Sure, anti-maskers, deniers, pandemic-fatigued, nearly many elsewhere.

Now, k-12 colleges/uni’s classrooms, plus partying (looking you, Providence College), plus pandemic fatigue cooler weather starting, numbers inching up.

I’d surprised reach states less compliant / antiscience populations see. 

Guess we’ll see. working restaurant get least minimum wage- regardless tips. Similar clerk earning. thought skipping phase? US used example ""what do"" ~~in pandemic~~ [INSERT HERE].

Fixed (healthcare generally, education, labour policy, governance, elections etc. Well, hopefully November 3 goes way need go get stimulus passed. go long way ensuring strong recovery get vaccination point risk high - kids coming home college, family gatherings Thanksgiving December, states opened without restrictions, election, struggle see non-destructive path unless vaccine becomes readily available late Nov early December. 

Could easily see need go broader, restrictive lockdown point early next year. 1k cases day 19 million people doesn’t sound bad? Arizona’s 500~ cases day 7.2 million relatively comparable, actually little higher rate. 

Although New York certainly potential cases snowball faster due population density. people follow lockdown Gates Foundation spearheaded multiple covid19 testing programs completely free working make covid19 vaccines free many people possible operating significant loss.

You ilk may want keep US isolated rest world rest us know understand massive problems like pandemic addressed work together globally.  much research used currently develop covid19 vaccines directly funded Gates Foundation.

I want pandemic death suffering come end continually standing way dealt one way another.  vaccine stop getting covid, helps fight it. Prisons overcrowded already, it'll protect visitors staff too.

And extreme side effects vaccine getting covid it'll prisoners ones find first. Basically test subjects. live Brazil simillar symptons October 2019. can't claim disease not.  Sweden entered chat without blowing economy Yeah saw AZ vent nav. Def sus America : We're number one!

Russia : Hold Kvass! MERICA ""hold beer"" say vaccine successfully rolled out, think that’s pretty rational time scale back restrictions surges cases vaccine rollout greatly blunted effect I'm team open everything back full lift restrictions. Russia 8800 cases per million, US 24000. nice piece science communication Amy McKeever, useful links details. stands sea sloppy journalism. Kudos writer NatGeo. reddit never truth, free website people post news opinions controlled people pay running it, that's is, large websites cost money host.

If cared karma would deleted comment feel free downvote reason blog post isn’t considered quality source. Find better source. sure sure thing. clerk rings groceries makes hour. great . mental image thousands poor souls sacrificed daily bases keep trump alive... thanks :/ bars closed, lot illegals parties Paris. pay close de 150€ enter, open bar stuff like that. police don’t plan stop them, could cope 100+ drunk people fighting them. state territory Australia second wave. Western Australia 180 days free it. ones hitting month months clear. 

My state 12 days free community transmission single digit cases they're tracing containing like last time happened time that.

Victoria unlucky one breach one quarantine location they've almost got things back do, they'll ready like rest us. none us second wave, they're going third.  What's weather like Russia right now? cases probably harbinger we'll see winter. Wisconsin already spiking again. get dont trust us numbers. putin poisoned guy said, oh probably poisoned himself. Oh country invaded? Yeah invited. Lose election? got 77% vote. 

To say us numbers say got caught 55mph 45 russia 95 drunk ,in school zone comparable. *Sees example something obvious* 

OP: ""Clear proof exact opposite Im seeing true!"" son appreciates it, others. 

I like people look back work service industry. Working waiting tables, cleaning others, makes much better adult experience, imo. guess municipalities won’t shutdown again. simply can’t afford it. hospitalizations continue stay flat, shutdown? agree,the issue hold back things opening. also question able afford go Broadway jobs &amp; industries continue slip downwards. Microsoft patent WO 060606. heard first lol Taiwan back: Right! one thing happen viruses spread widely, constantly mutating. spreadable disease particular mutation found widely, it’s less deadly, you’ll get infected less death simply strain prominent. don’t know 100% happening, know usually happens. spreadable less lethal (since doesn’t kill host would expect time spread). needs get better lot things. They’ve basically fckd every way possible pandemic even late designating it! Yes like zero comprehension words speak. Take pride want guess. much COVID want? 1,2 billion passengers flown, IATA finds 44 plausible cases in-flight infections. 

This seems *really low*, would expected much higher bad bot seen anything pre-recorded videos

Please stop spreading meritless speculation. video rather highly compressed, glitchiness due video compression artifacts. gonna long hard winter anyone healthcare. Commander-in-Queef seems determined take many people can, huh? Along joyriding, public appearances, refusing participate virtual debate, sure sounds like one goal try spread much possible. :/ Russia anti-American anti-European. fact, due recent events it’s becoming even generally anti-Western isolationist. Russian politic elite interest apart getting much money pockets can, recently stopped caring public opinion either. America Russia messing countries’ business, Russia unprecedented scale. Berlin always shithole alternative people coming place thinking figured life. Sadly capitol people measure culture based whats happening there. wouldnt surprised berlin becomes next hotspot, well deserves it. suppose technically still see lot mask usage central Phoenix. Granted, lot chin diaper noses sometimes mouths exposed, they’re still wearing masks, eh?

Grocery shopping stressful af. sure effective skeptics claim vivid fake shall receive treatment contract covid shit, sherlock ... going die (i guessing higher exposure, co-morbidity etc) taking Remdesivir help .

If going die , might well refuse Remdesivir (if covered insurance) suffer little longer , OK end. mean, people likely gather things generally, makes sense. realize stem cell lines made aborted fetuses whatever nonsense anti-science crowd propagandized? racism odds 80% favour, 90% Presidential care gets. Chancellor Merkel meeting heads eleven biggest German cities.

The leaders Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Munich, Frankfurt, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Dortmund, Essen, Leipzig Stuttgart meet video conference brief chancellor situation discuss proceed, numbers generally big cities course big factors, especially Berlin. data fucking jaw dropping, seriously raises many questions answered.

How going almost 1 million jobless claims week, almost 4 times 5 times weekly average pandemic still exact things 4 months ago pretending people hungry. Still giving need less money delaying stimulus going people country. Same. baby hardly left house. take store today. put rain cover carseat (clear shield) store. lady ask rainging. looked stupidly (we live cal) told mask back up. He’s got regular DNA, USA. Gonna Debby Downer here. clear 400,000 numbers avoidable, even vaccine. Let's say vaccine 50% effective (Fauci's estimates think), we'll see reduced transmission rate, drop zero. take us **longer** hit 400,000 mark, that's it. Yup, Gorbachev power Putin came through, wanted friendly relations. USA said screw soviet ally, wanted enemy local elections. 95% who've mild symptoms still health issues six months. right, formulated makes sense average African weighs 133.8lbs, average American weighs 170-198lbs, depending sex. That's big chunk it. 95% 5% serious symptoms. beginning this, never would guessed America handle world situation worst nation regardless trump. blame falls America much him, rest world showed America’s refusal politics astounding. Blame trump blame Facebook blame whatever whoever fact America failed people won’t looked generations. Parrots one intelligent non-human creatures planet, fyi. understand complex concepts like love, zero, etc. almost like previous Republican Bush went endless wars tanked economy, killed youth made us international villains. people never struggled lifes think. wearing mask triggers hard scared freedom human rights... dont know. Freedumbs!  read economist article... amazing far counties death counts. rationale stated picked two months something reasonably aggressive, yet also somewhat, kind middle,"" said Marks ""Not aggressive, conservative -- middle."" Murphy Ranch Rustic Canyon. I've read torn down, there's still buildings left. way relates comment. fun since essentially irrelevant spam.


To address comment (something showed capable yourself)
We also know true number dead yet. like never new virus first year. numbers also based results taking precautions. Lastly, counting deaths immediate symptoms. know yet many people dying months symptoms. also information many people life long debilitating conditions compared flu.

Personally living. I'm kayaking. Swimming. art projects. Reading. more.

You socially distance wear masks still enjoy life. feel sorry truly stopped living. values completely wrong low europe. tons people either asymptomatic light symptoms? think true 95% infected people health issues 6 months. Good tip man, here's another. 
When eaten food, point gonna shit out. countries right refuse investigation? this, type investigation? intensive they..? five six year olds. need lot parental help. Religion really boat anchor progress. Sputnik 5 vaccine working? distributed? Try scheduling Telehealth visit - almost insurance carriers offer it’s typically available 24/7.  Nothing wrong risking lives others give shit kid /s would sell house move country second got news. Ontario needs lock back ASAP.  Explain like I'm 35 reasonably good understanding biology medical field training all? Oh, thanks. seeing positive part, they'll beta testers study problems selection bias, big, dense city might expect higher nation whole anyway. 

SO yeah, 10% seems reasonable. Welp one trump’s friends isn’t getting trump’s medical cocktail there’s shit chance ever will. That's get France. Good point Navalny, poisoning signals shift situation, probably putin believes things get fragile needs remove possible amplifiers. Khabarovsk maybe felt would become amplifier take real action protests.

Imagine Kadyrov died soon east started riot split away. anyone replace Kadyrov, alternatively hope stabilizing Russian control Chechnya situation? get Hallelujah?! Narcissists friends. emotionally capable sort mutual bond. state controlled media dictator president

So call Fox Trump? Denmark always 2x higher testing capacity Sweden (or least March 24th so). something new. new thing positivity rate increasing, regardless testing capacity staying somewhat stable (or droping bit October higher level second half September) Denmark, similarly see Sweden, except hospitalizations deaths also started increasing, unlike least far Sweden. That's development Denmark currently looks worrisome, finding confirmed cases, cases result uptick severe cases too. hope lost then. injecting bleach veins? water wet. like new space race post overall success treatment individual, mention population wide morbidity all. Sorry clear enough. Black Plague *novel* 1300s. really simple making child complete assignments home. teacher said breezed work complaints class. home takes least half hour tears arguing get complete assignment level far capable of. can't force 5 year old school work would rather sit room without form entertainment day write sentence. teacher much screen, much without benefits classroom environment. 

Distance learning directly caused child's problems. expect teachers fix right take risks comfortable purely education. sides need give grace understanding. Killing million people is? C'est la fin! understand school could one transport mechanisms, get high rate fast,? Perhaps tourism also factor? (Not mention locals returning holiday) Eh...but always found Europeans far conformist Americans actually. think social pressure could work certain European countries, people reason stopped giving AF government opened shit again. Look Czech doing...they listened initially went shit.

You can't shit like wishy washy mask mandate. Fucking tell citizens wear keep up. needs look blessing. next day is. company work extended wfh mid next year. Q&amp;A c-staff level tech, impression get lot executives feel productive. Companies could potentially save cost office space/supplies, travel, etc. also afford hire talent would work slightly lower rate could work remotely.

This long-time coming. Coronavirus really sped inevitable up. improvements increased methods remote work, we'll likely see happening more.

I stress everyone. advantage house private office work of, recognize privilege co-workers take meetings literally closets. That’s scary part mild covid19, one knows long term effects it. Something could pop back months years later. young people might fine don’t know future. man sub worships literally said so. see old rivalry USA Russia flaming again. 

Who take gold end? much special relationship. Tax breaks rich; tax burden everyone else. Yep. I’ll accept time long refer friends. US rookie numbers lol Locking society medical science. fuck sakes! Obviously driving massive diesel truck entire time. would really help savings. really messed one friend. Rely Canada's instead. states thing maybe work Canada. comes. started back prep!

I’m state now, I’m pretty sure worked together indie shitshow HV point. Consent US policy body choice.

Your right swing fist ends nose. time being, extends respiratory droplets.  Imagine grandparents get virus, statistically speaking least one die. bloodthirst signaling killing grandparents well good maybe stop acting like even care them. people still think contain thing get cases deaths close zero? couldn’t summer there’s chance hell winter. Starting feel like contest Here's idea: INTERVIEW REAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST, silver-spoon scumbag monopolist billionaire set computing back decade greedy fuckwit. Locking society medical procedure. fuck sakes! guys completely brainwashed? Russia finally catching US testing standards. Nice would think flee older retired republicans  whole world lying amount cases ands deaths.

Totally. 

Heck, I’ve *personally* particular virus 26 times already I’ve died 17 times, government counted one case didn’t report single one 17 times died. COVID fucked lungs up.

Wow hard, sure gonna able it. post comment removed 

This opinion piece, sorry

 ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Agreed, every western country shit talked Americans made fun handled virus without realizing exact same, took bit time show it. know someone literally moved California South Dakota escape ""communists"" COVID restrictions.  Locking society medical treatment. fuck sakes! Yep. Sure I’m starting shit, edited original post. When’s going up? Jeeze trying nice explain misunderstanding see LOT people terms understanding relationships leading/lagging indicators. sure pitting sort self-proclaimed genius.

How this, want turn game keeping score? Go it. continue doubt relationship current case counts future hospitilizations I'll continue concerned health people live advocate taking serious approach towards preventing mass deaths.

Over past several decades, multiple coronaviruses (CoVs) emerged highly infectious, lethal viruses humans, notably pandemic outbreak COVID-19, disease caused SARS-CoV-2. date, known therapeutic preventative agents target CoVs. Though age comorbidities severely increase case fatality rates, host factors influence resistance susceptibility infection highly pathogenic human CoVs unknown. Innate immune responses CoVs initiated recognition double-stranded (ds) RNA induction interferon, turns gene expression program inhibits viral replication. SARS-CoV-2 conserves ADP-ribosylhydrolase domain previously shown counteract innate immunity mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), model CoV, SARS-CoV. show SARS-CoV-2 infection cell lines, infected ferrets, deceased patient’s lung consistently strikingly dysregulates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) gene set respect NAD+ synthesis utilization. SARS-CoV-2 induces set poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members; PARPs include enzymes required innate immune response MHV. Further, show MHV infection induces attack host cell nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). data indicate overexpression virally induced PARP, PARP10, sufficient depress host cell NAD metabolism NAD+ boosting strategies differ efficacy restore PARP10 function.

Bolsheviks overthrew provisional government transfered power workers' councils (soviets), working class became ruling class Russia, political precondition transition communist society, economically Russian economy semi-feudal little developed even begin economic transformation communism, would require economic assistance Europe, already industrialized fully capitalist. Lenin's words, task Bolsheviks Russia industrialize Russia establish state-capitalism controlled proletarian state, i.e, carry capitalist revolution, supporting worldwide communist revolution unite world global soviet republic, however defeat German revolution 1923 world revolutionary wave defeated. Without assistance world proletariat, proletarian state Russia incapable going capitalism politically degenerated back capitalist state working class lost position ruling class 1928, counter-revolutionary degeneration carried Stalinists abandoned world revolution false theory ""building socialism one country"". genuine communists first expelled party later executed thrown concentration camps, communist revolution lost. TLDR: October revolution simultaneously capitalist communist revolution, however since communist revolution succeed globally world revolution failed capitalist aspect revolution ended overwhelming obliterating communist aspect.

All ""socialist"" states Cold War always capitalist states state-capitalism industry, never communist arise workers revolutions support world revolution. governments took power either imposed militarily Stalinist Russia revolutions propertied classes: middle classes (petty-bourgeoisie) peasantry, bourgeois revolutions vein French Revolution rather genuine communist revolutions (such Vietnam China).  would 100,000 cases country size US.

These people *adults*. electricity water use doubled year, track $1,000 2019 $2,000 year. top thinking really need real office, remodel would likely cost $25,000. friends dont spare bedroom working kitchen table, starts work well kids.

There reason people work offices. know number generated from, comes antibody sampling around globe.

It makes sense *one* respect though. Look France, Spain, UK moment. Look many 'cases' have, generating deaths. use ratio cases/deaths back April (before widespread testing), number 'actual' cases *possibly* 20x, 30x even higher generate deaths.

The % asymptomatic certainly much much higher originally thought.

This type calculation by-no-means perfect, gives sense figure *could* accurate.

There interesting study came Japan tracked ~800 people number months found serum antibodies went 5% subjects positive ~40%, without large number 'cases' registered. conclusion asymptomatic cases far higher originally anticipated.

So saying fomite transmission ruled initially claiming?

Seems erring side caution confirmation pretty foolish. insist assuming things publicly confirmed science said means TB COVID possibly equivalent deadly depending want move goalposts fit argument. COVID killing 1M 8 months roughly TB killing 1.5M 12. Cut snarky ass rhetoric smart think are

How coronavirus killing ***more*** people per month mean equivalent?

It 8 months. 7 tops metric set regarding deaths started spike Europe. trying move goal post know wrong?

Additionally, infection rates climbing world, taking extreme measures world keep numbers low.

Why denying well established science says extreme measures reduce general, public ""what every cold flu season,"" said Dr. John Wiesman, health secretary Washington state -- first US case Wuhan coronavirus confirmed. includes washing hands often soap water least 20 seconds. one feeling sick, cover mouth nose cough sneeze, disinfect objects surfaces touch. doctor suspect might Wuhan coronavirus, CDC advises wearing surgical mask.

First off, January 2020 2020 started. claimed knew begining fomite transmission known non-factor. evidence support claim?

Your quote say fomite transmission issue. fact, would encouraging handwashing concern fomite weeks prior, even sure could transmitted human human thanks China basically lying world jailing anyone deigned report anything contrary CCP rhetoric. 

So admit incorrect said figured beging?

And yeah, china fucked world over. anything anti science claims inability understand math claim knew everything negjnging also admitting didn't.

Make investigation needed ascertain presence human-to-human transmission, modes transmission, common source exposure presence asymptomatic mildly symptomatic cases undetected,"" said statement. ""It critical review available information fully understand potential transmissibility among humans.

So yet another quote saying know everything fomite transmission?

***If everyone stopped eating foods, found global farmland use could reduced 75 per cent, area equivalent size US, China, Australia EU combined.""***

Saying veganism reduce death suffering demonstrably 100% false. died could live. fact kill eat stop pretending didn’t harvest wheat made bread aren’t implicit deaths mice rabbits insects.

What's conclusion logic? somebody car accident may well buy machine gun start gunning pedestrians same, right? are, farmer tell there’s way system. Responsibility something sorely lacking here. 

I'm responsible buying food, right, take full responsibility that. folks comments (and guess apparently well chose hide behind alt), don’t really care half actually goes agriculture isn’t factory farming, watch sappy docudrama outdated animal abuse footage. 

Of course care, that's choose make difference. care anything. Yet are. die, it’s life. 

Things die, therefore murder okay...? rabbit field doesn’t sit contemplate legality whether murder manslaughter run combine it. 

It's good job I'm vegan then, likelihood happening would 4x greater wasn't. dead, it’s dead future sandwich. walked pasture ended life one cows.

Okay besides massive difference much death suffering caused vegan non vegan, still pretending car accident school shooting. happened vaccine distributing? 25 countries higher 14 day totals 31 countries higher daily totals (per 100k, know number actually means pump numbers up. rookie numbers racket. myself, get **3x** much day.* \- Czech pump numbers up. rookie numbers racket. myself, get **4x** much day.* \- Israel assume switched ""per day"" ""total cases"" without telling anyone, hope see people would assume still topic metric person responding to.

OP said gets twice much day. comment appears saying get 24,000 *per million per day*??? obviously incorrect. got 58,000 total day, nation 330 million.  sick November California totally it. Facebook mommy friends too. /s Yes testing way up. let stop fear porn! Positive cases mean Coronavirus contact, COVID (VIH different AIDS way)
Asymptomatic cases mean people developing immunity son lives LA we’ve unable see year.
I made pact husband would get get see him. allowed travel safely pandemic over.
I’m asthmatic hyper vigilant wasn’t would still act like it’s way!
You stay safe keep wearing mask too! It’s crap us matter country hopefully encourages follow suit ❤️ Russian military separately declares collect tolls it, I'll buy it. We've definitely states way worse days though. Florida population 1/3rd size France 15,300 new cases day back July. NY's worst day 12,274 new cases one day April. NYs population France, would scale roughly 43k cases. even worse consider almost cases NYS.

The US really saved huge farm areas separating densely populated cities, particularly East West. small European countries luxary. There's difference enjoying something recognizing minor inconvenience large positive benefits. Refusing accept minor inconvenience health society antisocial. often wonder people use ""my body choice"" wearing mask, feel woman's choice say ""No"" body autonomy. Crap! That’s one day. Second wave 🌊 looking worst don’t think it’s appropriate talk high risk people like they’re adversaries. I’d call “incivility”. nice one bro clearly demonstrated much intelligent capable thought are. truly incredible am, governors instituted lockdowns grasp reality. western pa feeling lockdowns reset could emerge fighting chance, yet obvious general public persisted willfully ignorant understanding Covid way spreads. Like dumb bag hammers understanding. never learned responsibly lift lockdown. dentist office talking small office care plan provider n95 mask complaining much PPE purchased safest place town (all wearing mask around neck.  Meanwhile wore masks around chins noses, rolled eyes asked “Covid survey questions” travel symptoms pretty much told say everything. Even dentist donned real PPE (face shield n95 drilling.  

Forget masks People can’t bothered even sit 4 ft apart indoors without mask. Attempted murder charges? article published almost 2 months ago.

If anything could say encouraging. apply reality? 

Actually does. start enforcing harsher penalties flouting inevitable longer keep things place, demonstrations happen around world.

People want country reopened want take measures keep way. offense, completely idiotic position have.

Even Sweden lockdown population abiding social distancing rules. NZ one least restrictions since May (barring 2 weeks Aug Auckland) literally restrictions. think NZ achieved mask mandates (level 2+) social distancing guidelines?

Also, people arguing mask mandates also dishonest platform. Let's clarify this: mask mandates absolutely paired social distancing guidelines want best way contain outbreak. Beyond NZ, countries like South Korean, Taiwan, Hong Kong Singapore good examples too. New Zealand island population size greater Miami Atlanta metro area. like 10 metro areas+ greater size move one other. 

Come now. That’s realistic.

Our peers Canada, France, Spain, Germany, UK. Every country want name comparison fair one reason another. United States unique situation. Lets prey Iowa shit bed even so.... might case counties individually tallying cases reporting residents. Whether accurate.... Yep! add, offered settle $20,000 (medical bills &amp; lost wages), McDonald's offered EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. SKIN GRAFTS. came they'd known risks ~10 years! done NOTHING!

They PR smear badly became figurehead ~frivolous~ lawsuits. Truly trash. Euro travel ban late likely caused larger outbreak hundreds thousands absolutely packed American airports flying back time beat deadline. Absurd. get mad virus, get mad leader's complete failure dealing it.  fall wave. It’s going get worse gets better. That’s said. censorship gains another ally total destruction freedom speech. today's world opinion goes mainstream narrative get censored also get labeled conspiracy theorist even terrorist. Reddit goto place uncensored information, news opinion. modern (keep people divided) world opinion goes agenda considered fake news even propaganda. reddit joins long list social media outlets censor opinion goes mainstream plan control. hope future allowed continue. reason people still support trump, either it’s cuz feel it’s “owning parties” cuz don’t want admit wrong look like think fool. vaccine doesn’t alter RNA? emphasis wearing masks early shutting indoor events bars/restaurants would optimal solution. people make life decisions macro level, think based themselves. stuff like "" sad, others worse"" work. Europe mostly way south... Germany, praised numbers, weeks ago 1.5k new cases, 2k, 2.5k, yesterday 4k, today 4.5k... Winter/fall coming people let guard down. result. beginning coming. us cost lot effort, lives, money restrictions get maybe till january/february kind control. next weeks/months one point show uncontrolled spread losses like new York bergamo. Wish us luck may god gracious us. Chick photo baller style doesn’t knowledge unfortunately Yes, know. Nice job science deniers. Texas DH 211 option she’s trying doesn’t get answers she’s gonna call local hospitals/clinics sure don’t anything think government place Russia could reformed? think entirely new system needs implemented? 

No. current system built around Putin, needs massive changes operational. Even Putin can't replace without changing system, relies personal connections way much. people government might integrated new system, though. find political upset Russia since trump got elected? American perspective world revolves around us talking?

While Russian government obsessed US still consider Russia competing superpower, personality President US fairly little influence Russian society. Russians mostly care bilateral relations countries rather different American personalities say; see US mostly single entity, group different branches power making different decisions. Trump positively received general public comparison Obama first, relations US deteriorated lowest point recent history, US remained #1 enemy Russia, Russians quickly become disappointed him. Trump's personal influence societal political trends Russia, think almost negligible. cultural influence US country much much bigger comparison, live global information space consume American media products all. actually believe shit? would easy leadership worked actually fighting Covid instead... can’t mention subreddit. People say understand socialism is.  Thank responsible! 
I completely agree, live California, LA specific. recently went town rural area people inside stores without masks!!! appalled felt bad workers. 
People also Trump flags place... tells anything. Yessir They're saying full lockdown two years. Bruh calculating numbers lol. using total numbers since beginning? Best way 14 day cumulative daily new cases (both per 100k, 1 million lmao)


Using methods data Oct 7 (since complete):

Daily cases per 100k

US: ~13.09
RU: ~7.96

Cumulative cases/14 days per 100k

US: 183.96
RU: 83.43

Also, 31 countries higher daily case rate US, 25 go 14 day case rate. 

If y'all wanna talk real shit look Israel Czech Republic. mask. There's virtually harm wearing one compared potential benefits. Get yourself. 6/10 were. new race begun America Russia first year Uni (28 year old transfer student) never got flu shot... got flu. thought would normal cold could bust couple days rest/water/vitamins.. kept feeling worse kept going. Ended missing entire first week half classes get bed Since Russia exactly trustworthy, suspect numbers higher? Wonder anything video made Apocalyptical band, Sorry didn’t mean break rules. Thank article though everything I’ve read far seems inconclusive. don’t understand level detail scientific papers. Locking 99% save 1% incredibly stupid idea basis policy, proven looking world right now. Protecting risk (the elderly nursing homes) goal . Thanks answering. unless get it, give someone say 50% 70% chance dying it. selfish like isnt something proud experts agree going take quite long time vaccine significant enough number effective, especially given lower adoption rates. It'll take better part year get out, available, people thinking time early next year... that's two years total right there? Mutations:
The virus continuously checked functional mutations world. Apart D614G, read important changes.
More importantly: first week, people infectious, second week, get severe illness. look like selective pressure towards milder cases me.

Different social groups:
Looks driver miracle. 

Weather:
The endemic ARIs worse cold weather.

Viral load:
I'd happily accept major contribution someone normalise load stats clinical criteria hospitalisations patient risk factors. 

Strong statistical evidence viral inoculum hypothesis could help motivating selfish part society.
I astonished studied scale. confirmed, would help pandemic control much. He's one hell Chech mate, he? intubated would wager.  Yes reliable count overall mortality would necessarily composed inaccurate/false counts country?

If saying accurate mortality infection _rates_ extrapolate from, I'd disagree: (1) depend heavily density effective health care system (2) know accurately yet, there's huge variance 0.4% 5% reported (3) we'd need accurate testing accurate reports testing, varies wildly countries. way. Lock major cities, even think reopening year already house. said, Frenchie. Look social media, like half people literally either care, think hoax, think somehow wearing masks infringes freedom. absolutely insane. disagree that. would mostly interested better paid sick leave programs people feel like go work sick, either. pointing another thing postpones death invest significant resources in.  almost like happy countries badly again. childish comment. Ok, unwarranted fatalism. logical ground extremist statements like ""the vaccine come late"" ""cause world economy collapse"". 

Congratulations adding problem. exactly kinds alarmist exaggerated statements make covid-deniers take risks seriously. trust institutions long gone. isn’t vax issue. first assertion simply false. lie. examples countries effectively controlled spread, cases without resorting lockdowns. common strong testing tracking infrastructures beggining powerful scietifical bodies monitor run show. 

Meanwhile, western governments nothing that, instead accepting negligence investing needed, people like spouting nonsense. Succesful countries retorted reality false dychotomy health economy, accountability. looks gonna well economy health. Meanwhile us...

Regarding say hospitals, best regards Madrid. ICUs limits. Yep. last bit ""come on, can't blatantly hypocritical without getting laughed society"" beaten 2020. news. I’ve known since May. also knew would inevitably cause lose job, did. MA, seeing uptick cases. also colleges brought students back. I'm within walking distance state university. students partying, hanging park social distancing. Plus leagues started deck hockey softball. Covid. try wish ill anyone. damn wish morons would get Ayyy welcome big leagues Russia! -US Yeah, can't keep asking ""what went wrong"" every single country world. Perhaps simple fact virus going spread matter there's nothing long run. Absolutely not, never said stay locked get cases zero. Ontario good job stage 2 dropping cases still people move around.

Then stage 3 hit everyone assumed covid cancelled, people threw caution wind trendy anymore. 

I agree plenty idiots think every measure affront civil liberties even though tried opening people could life back work morons got careless. idiots cry freedoms ones stupid holding everyone back sense normalcy can't responsible. looking bad month ago, closed bars/resturants 10:00, hopefully guys soon enough. Sending best wishes. sorry, India takes cup time. think so?

In European countries, understand good statistics one best tools help adjust response. Others consider matter politics isn't. matter survival. Majority population maybe. Majority country no. 2/10 province, 2/13 subnational entities majority country. shouldn’t let control lives though... too, mostly winter, less day light cause indoors gatherings, colder temperature. Indoor gatherings viruses BFF. dancing videos didn’t help credibility. Cure world? Great! Make fucking money want. medical treatment

Ok, ""preventive medicine"", 4 u bb ;) Trump said brought back football happened? Switzerland? Yes, possible, borders can't entirely shut. China quarantining every single arrival 14 days ages. Many people commute across Swiss border daily work, example, that's clearly feasible. relevant matter hard Switzerland's lockdowns are, little control measures outwith borders. 

China's approach let virus die -- extensive contact tracing quarantine/isolation. Anyone virus isolated, put away rest society, they've recovered. virus anyone infect. Repeat eventually longer virus infect anyone, 14+ days patients either die recover longer infectious. course, things like masking staying home also help immensely keeping transmission down.

Where live, awfully long time since anything happened, really. general, area community transmission long time, quite secure suppose Covid-free. pure speculation suppose mainland China actually Covid-free lots things add up, like zero local case record lack covid-related medical situations despite society approaching normal. vaccine, shows better results. absolutely better nothing. grateful life. Think may join us r/qanoncasualties Holy shit okay there?  March/April 2021 normalcy around Fall 202q Fuck, thought Germany handled! buying bullshit selling, quite literally.  plays right hands people claim coronavirus depopulation Mormon girl follow Instagram lives Utah neighborhood protests re-open schools. It’s ridiculous. mistaken, looks like announced full shut March 11th. would still take it. Watch social dilemma Netflix. interesting documentary seen while. Found Trump. :) That's kind going that. :)

I remember Tool edgy that, remember Hush came out. Re-listening it, one reasons like much songs time? bass line interesting enough me. Schism's one remember liking more. Ok don’t want like men, congratulations, hard admit men general actually like this? Seriously husband mostly good I’ve good men partners know way men ive dated classic men characteristics. hard men admit sex kind shit time? “Whaaa you’re sexist! men!!” Okay, enough men generally accepted male characteristics worldwide, what’s problem people pointing out? Like legit husband bitches men act like acknowledges it’s typical behavior. can’t acknowledge without getting offended? are, fact, exactly like complaints kind behavior cut close? think interviews gave predicted next human apocalypse would disease. remember France peaked 7.6 thousand first wave Exactly, would actually put even least bit effort could seen countries whose reported deaths match closely excess death statistics. 

And lot countries least far off, definitely far enough justify conspiracy theories giant cover up.

But that's exciting enough people sub. mean trapped room fire anywhere probably die anyway. MDHHS reinstated almost immediately. Mandate still effective Article says 1500 new cases showed Oklahoma today. Would suprised Tulsa rally one patient Zero events point. remember sick time. mom tried convince find HCQ ‘cured’ acted could buy Amazon. Found hours ago Kroger enforcing mask policy anymore. Saw influx picked meds.

Fry's acting like typhoid Mary cuz entitled shits yelled loud enough ""muh rights""? even tell plague rats leave store. like 9/11 first responders? Oh, wait...  lady fashionable. Looks like something Blade Runner. knew guy swore even bad Ohio, wife works hospital says never even remotely close even 50% capacity. Said hoax mortality rate lower even seasonal flu common cold. 

Key word: knew. safe people, vigilant stay safe. shock anyone? Getting older sucks everyone Nah nah nah, don’t change goal posts. talking real big shit city wasn’t US, cases handled, defended karaoke. look pathetic situation. Going back lockdown, karaoke banned. Stfu eat someone lives AZ. Gyms open. Bars open. Walmart’s stores longer capacity limit. mask mandate suggestion considering I’m almost always one wearing one. 

But tell it’s getting harder harder find testing site doesn’t take 3 weeks give results. refuse test altogether

So take whatever fuck care Bill Gates thinks?  Must *fuckin’* nice! Gee, wonder accurate numbers (under reporting?) umm, no. suppose myriad things less harmful covid 19 ""hysterical"" about. actually mean wrote? Personally, would think like SoCal pass, county. aside, think probably number different things could implement help avoid kinds issues make fairly robust system. Probably first easiest thing could use IP tracking determine reservation made from. course text savvy folks would know get around fairly easily, would solve somewhat large number cases. Next, think one robust measures would put reservation credit card address limit. Finally, anyone who’s name reservation, 18, license suffice prove residency. documents may used, like utilities case someone moved recently kind issue. nice thing passholders kind verification probably needs done once. think it’s worth noting system probably wouldn’t catch everyone, significantly raises barriers people traveling, especially state. think measures I’ve listed would provide sufficient enough deterrent masses folks trying game system.

Also, case Disney, certainly fine based passholders area alone. Given capacity would severely restricted, doubt wouldn’t really need make ticket sales could still probably get fairly decent attendance, least what’s allowed. think restriction would probably able increased eventually phased Disney parks show ability operate without causing additional problems. course, that’s contingent upon able show that’s case, would suspect would become negotiable decent track record show. Shit, whole damm country spiking last weeks. Hell, whole WORLD spiking last weeks. feeling good Summer might licked thing. contest want win.  main concern padova suddenly classes would go fully online, know blaming university? Im Peru(cases going almost 7 weeks) enter Italy, spend 2 weeks Spain, city wqyyyyyy lower cases Madrid.

By way, much price room private bathroom? Housinganywhere seems costly, like 400 euros room 2 bathrooms 6 persons bills included, site secure better prices? Pottle calling kettle black. Look around bud, everybody fucked - happen social nets don’t have.

Singapore island that's valid comparison else compare NZ Singapore would look awful. fact geography people live vary across world there's comparison apple oranges Believe people refuse get tested US too. live Northern California, state aggressive response Covid (in opinion). county densely populated county east 75% rural 25% densely populated. county never made “the list” shut downs. Why? population made efforts keep people county getting tested therefore artificially keeping case counts county artificially low. Besides masks (which people wear religiously) things pretty normal including schools open. Schools area, two miles away, won’t open hybrid model elementary students November 9... right beginning flu season. communist countries world right now. 

Chinas system fusion capitalism command economy government dictates enterprises do. wow vaccine working intended. would 540,000 infections, 2,984 deaths. 0.5% IFR math correct?

Edit: assuming selection bias course folks losing detectable antibodies. states charge disclosing numbers. lots ways hide cases. USA sus let's vote em millionth time people survive virus lifelong medical conditions result lower life expectancy.  People still dying complications resulting virus decades pandemic ended.  Lockdowns going save hell lot 0.1% population.

Again people fed ilk continue pushed around put danger longer. Yes is. trying.

That’s way world evolve Covid too. takes time, treatments covid need effective vaccine widely available. treat Covid truly exception year passed silly. reason restrictions novel, deadly. It’s new—we don’t know treat effectively, don’t vaccine, don’t know enough long term effects that's standard, would find people entire world deserve sympathy. unless live utopia, chances government shit ""stand to"" well. sympathy too. Would mean IFR much lower thought? Automod set crazy strict tense topic. often get comments deleted reinstated actual mods. They're erring side caution. blame them, there's *lot* anger.

I'm saying invalid weird/odd see exact request day day out. FDA packed actual scientists doctors. approved, legit.

The FDA approved emergency use authorization hydroxychloroquine treat covid March. later turned hydroxychloroquine helpful treating covid all.

So believe FDA's emergency use authorization rushed vaccine better? 

The American FDA CDC politicized credible. Listen European saying, American agency saying. ""When looked actual local Los Angeles population, (we found) 80% cases actually shared highest similarity strain found New York, know actually originated Europe.""

Only 15% cases Seattle came China. suppose virus could started China, traveled Europe, New York, Seattle. implying original source country, time got Seattle come directly China. tell genes. Man, I've got bridges go sell. Right, guess always hallmark Nazis use innovations right? Since we're going origin concept fit narrative right? live Minnesota know fact you’re wrong.

If outside didn’t reduce risk Coronavirus, Minnesota would one hardest hardest hit state summer protests started here, massive.

Instead, slight increase cases protest, quickly fizzled out. wasn’t spike, small bump. 

COVID spread well outdoors, especially you’re moving you’re outside. That’s fact. paper found 28 percent undercount compared excess deaths. It’s May. Obviously deaths lag, things take time.




Here recent study percent undercount.


I’m bit biased I’ve expecting Covideracy undercount game speak, I’ve expecting undercount worsen.

I think evidence undercount problem (something think tgeir broad consensus experts for) undercount worsening hypothesis. works citizens respect government

If government respect citizens citizens respect government? Wait, symptomatic even 26th, Rose Garden event? patient zero White House? everyone blaming administration giving - sounds like could one spreading there? I'm actually mindblown people giving away rights freedom like piece trash.

One day, old ass politicians decided cant leave home essential, ever, anymore.

You're supposed stay home die okay it? guess. yeah, either take capitalism glory, welcome socialism (or least hybrid system socialism - wealthy, already have). Don’t let dominate life.

I optimistic enough force within Democrats overwhelming evidence Trump administration's wrongdoings inquiries happen soon Biden starts. GOP cooperated Dems anyway since Obama's presidency arguably Clinton's impeachment.

The Democrats put together enough arguments Trump's impeachment calling investigation crimes (and one particular abuse power), can't see they'd fail follow got full control houses. Vaccine widely available =/= Vaccine widely used

Vaccinating large part 300‘000‘000 people takes long time. Also, won’t reach herd immunity vaccine, many anti-vaxxers. thank still restrictions despite vaccinated. BS exactly? Reacting trying contain lifetime pandemic? nothing, keep everything open, whovever dies, dies, right? realize applied entire country, assuming lowest .01 percent deathrate, that's 3 million people dead? justify 200,000+ already dead, let alone 3 million? exact article already posted sub censored, op bother search complaining. reposted many times point. \+1 

I seen skeptics claiming let infect everybody pandemic ends faster 'less time' dangerous mutations. thinking counterproductive . least state, clear guidelines schools face face, hybrid, distance based cases within country. It’s set stone countries huge concentrated outbreaks. Schools go less strict long justify why. public schools urban area distance learning even though could hybrid. There’s mask mandate whole state restrictions regardless. surrounding states basically restrictions it’s tough keep numbers down.  time shame overweight? Iowa still won’t. governor “hopes” Iowans right thing. I’m fucking kidding says that. immunity, antibodies fade looks like memory cells all. least part appears virus actively messes memory cell generation. might reasons too. 

There enough time huge wave reinfections appear US -- places got hit hard early hit March, since kept lid infections (though things going direction spiraling control too). places sustained spread truly blew June July. much time lose immunity except sporadic cases. sporadic cases showing literature now, many more. Note published cases identified July latest -- takes time finalize papers, many reinfections identified right now, going hear happens, going see papers month two now. 

In Iran, however, hit hard, substantial fraction population infected, already January-March period, another massive wave too. alone kills ""herd immunity 20-30-whatever %"" theories, also reporting lot reinfections too. enough time show there.

When New York blows seriously December, expect see lots reinfections too. don't, rare indeed.

But default assumption always lasting immunity. coronaviruses studied, lasting immunity. 

Why decide one confer lifelong immunity even asymptomatic infection? basis evidence exactly available facts point totally opposite direction? posted million times sub already. conspiracy. Reminder metadrama sub rules. want believe Why? offered first. you, Dr Venture? Here's understanding non-medical masks work:

Virtually barrier infected person air reduce amount pathogen air, although much varies barrier. Every exhalation make relative humidity close 100% average, means significant amount exhaled virus ""trapped"" water droplets sizes. mask blocks moisture moving air, better wearing it. likely. people dying struggling long term effects, definitely minority.

I live state 150 people died July, 100 coming nursing homes another 30 people 50. leaves 20. local newspaper highlighted one 20, young mother 2 25 years old. Articles like perpetuate myth COVID dangerous is. Yes, truly dangerous, want roll dice. catch it, likely survive. state, 7000 people tested positive far October, 70 died. there's lag math still legit say roughly 1%. Damn really wrote essay Reddit comment people won’t read Well yes, 11 days ago still totally within realm one person's sickness. I'd suspect wait longer see results. could exposed this. I'm sure they're small hospitals like that. larger hospitals, separate wing floor protocols entering COVID areas. feel *should* full investigation chest scans, pneumonia samples etc still have, certain administrations would rather risk narrative change here. pandemic came month later latam.

That's immoral heathen! Yeah I've seen argument before, sure much buy it. see much flu season south america example. Given social distancing measures still exist lot places, clear odds getting viruses time. Theoretically possible, statistically would bet really low.  what's ten days thursday? 

hmm Well, there’s still hope chance! every state need hospitals pushed edge take seriously? They’ve decades experience authoritarian rule ex-Soviet countries. Giving Russia access internet mistake administration’s vaccine czar speak, spent three decades GlaxoSmithKline’s GSK, +1.55% vaccines business joining boards Moderna Inc. MRNA, +0.77% Lonza Group AG LONN, +0.14%. resigned roles joined administration. (Moderna developing one late-stage COVID-19 vaccines part Operation Warp Speed, Lonza one Moderna’s manufacturing partners vaccine candidate.) Apparently so, I'm kind bummed believe wanted real proposed analogy, I'd agree stretch. Comically, scenario illustrate effective critique Great Barrington Declaration. Weird! 🤔 Yep. one cared influenza. don’t even take account pneumonia high risk influenza. Combined that’s 100k given year. 

Goes show power media feeble minds. Power isn’t weaponry. communication. [This cdc website. also crazy diarrhea, like pissing asshole 10 times yesterday each. keep blaming seafood idk. Hey we're cocky, cos we're greatest... Oh nevermind. Jeez, total 340,000 new cases scary back then. feels like one really cares. Thanks! saying information valuable, misleading post along news sources. flagged government propaganda, people draw conclusions whether believe not. Pretty small ratio cases death... Trusting Russians health risk.

They obviously going report serious side effects. coronavirus much severe flu, people little careful public isn’t fucking whole generation kids wrong BBC talk like proven, real thing. clear yet proven exist, long ""covid stuff"" speculation anecdote.

There's still little scientific evidence explain whether even exists, basis is. plenty ""long covid"" ""sufferers"" never even tested positive once. There's published evidence (which find) suggesting virus lay dormant (like Varicella Herpes). Nothing showing changes structure function organs could explain symptoms.

I'm going make semi-educated assumption sizeable % psychosomatic. mind crazy shit make feel terrible, pandemic mass public hysteria, even moreso. That's write bullshit, would require perhaps mental therapy rather physical therapy.

This hallmarks ""fake"" disease chronic Lyme. huge laundry list totally random symptoms. little burden proof say it. joke serious? Vaccine working? NYC islands support GOP then. 15 minute talking point general example help figure situations avoid.

It isn’t rule virus operates by; time spend infected person, higher chances getting infected are. there’s indication virus isn’t capable infecting someone 10 minutes contact. Man. Looking around Reddit you’d think kind behavior happened USA. guess entire planet fucked. Population India: 1.353 billion

Population Russia: 144 million they're getting much cases hard hide? actual number 12k good news, need many countries get program. Especially big producers China. Away Religions helped spread virus around world. Oh fuck off. think even remotely limited conservatives republicans, literally missing point. part problem. good reasons hate them. Overwhelming majority Russians approved Putin's pillaging Ukrainian territories. I'm Ukrainian 8 months we're still beginning first wave. said beginning 10+ years we're back normal. bet looking good far. Here’s curious coincidence. 15 states highest rate new cases per capita last 7 days voted Trump 2016.

Why listen Billy boy ignore dozens doctors Stanford *screaming* (scientifically speaking) lockdowns causing much harm good. call Hannity last night fair amount coughing hoarseness. understand comment made though. next summer everything back normal, get shitfaced want mask.

Don't make false promises things cannot possibly control. Shitty misinformation like huge part political issue medical one U.S. No. Obesity big factor mortality anymore.

That’s somewhat normal procedure. sending overflow patients hospitals another design system. 

New York never overrun. Nobody New York City height flu COVID go without attention doctor ICU bed. Nobody died COVID yet couldn’t get hospital bed doctor. makes Utah different today would happen? back NY nobody knew anything going spread everyone still sharing everything like elevator space, subways such. literally worst case scenario yet nobody died overrun. So... guess vaccine working? [*proudly plays national Everyone reddit comedian now. Aladeen ok even 100 thousand cases day deaths stay 2 nice, 4/5 countries really give shit accurate numbers Niet!!!

I’m sure know better experts conducting experiment. /s A-like-a Borat? think less person wants die people caring COVID deaths forgetting everything else. instance, people minimizing deaths influenza viruses kill many people COVID. last pandemics (Swine Flu, 1957 flu, Hong Kong flu) influenza viruses sill killed people. 1957 flu Hong Kong flu killed masses people--both far deadlier globally COVID--but one remembers deaths. today, people still dying things COVID we've lost perspective focus COVID. concerned COVID still remembering problems world. mourn COVID deaths without acting like deaths matter. read somewhere cell receptor COVID-19 attaches becomes common higher levels testosterone. That's children tend effected badly (fewer years testosterone ""staining""), men tend fare worse women. 

But scientific papers that. Take heaping serving salt. numbers relevant USA testing Russia?  someone enlighten compares redundancy package? USA: Hold beer reminds joke:

Nurse doctor: ""Doctor, stimulant room 314 died!""
Doctor: ""Now he's exaggerating!"" Buying time makes sense something aimed though, endpoint. like Fourth July? Covid woke AF, you’d think would step aside let people celebrate...maybe Feb... nebrec nulo they're paid lockdown. Creating SPH orders without substantial stimulus package ludicrous. yep point, US numbers trustworthy Russia’s. must meant us a. lot chin diapers too. Ass sad. know do. Hong Kong certainly figured one densest areas planet.

An outbreak 40 cases Hong Kong, start shutting things down. also 90% mask compliance extremely robust contact tracing. really simple. easy, simple. Sorry, gonna happen. vaccine won’t entirely effective, thing spreading decades. I’m staying away bars now. Carmen sandiago thumbnail? survive severe vascular lung damage even mild cases

In percentage cases though? Refusal wear mask needs become criminal offense.  people going wear mask EVER.  time start holding accountable. Look things can't realistically falsified, like total mortality. Russia sits 50-80k excess deaths May-August, gives us scale. approval rating like 90s% - think cares.  ...even real democracy. Besides, dead people can't vote either.

...at end day, financial stability popular supporting retirees. Btw: assume herd immunity 50 % assume reinfections neglected, pace (10 % 7 months) would take 2.3 years reach herd immunity. 1k day entire countries. Mexico City, Seoul, Shanghai, Jakarta, London comparable density don’t nearly many cases. Russian vaccine flop hard? BIG STRONG NUMBERS!

They're shutting bars act stupid. photos packed bars Scottsdale. Testing pretty easy numbers sus. basically governor crapped bed took credit everyone else cleaned up.

Don’t assume that. served, servers put together to-go orders. made tipped minimum wage, 5.44 state. So... what? deaths hospitalizations remained entirely flat. 

They peaked July 15. 

Everything largely open. I’ve going dentist, going restaurants, going gym, grappling. wear mask indoors. I’m Miami.

Why care cases isn’t affecting health infrastructure? Wasn’t start? overwhelming hospitals? Yeah that's thing people get. early stage one. may open bars whatnot things going back normal completely ten years. anything left look forward to. going entire generation traumatized healthcare workers. Hopefully care offered future help cope this. Really? keep media around around world, you? generalizing narrow slice picture, filtered particular political lens? Inquiring minds want know.

You think they're detecting real COVID deaths also overcounting places like rural India Brazil, eh? Sure, bud. cancer contagious, church would ideal place go well. people murder.  consequences it. share idiots, least people licking shop doors protect freedoms. know 1.5M people died Tuberculosis last year? It’s nothing like 1918 silly either untrue half-truth misinformation.

Facts feelings friend. Yes right. remember people mocking ""two weeks"" right deaths shot AZ, TX FL. didn‘t hear good while. Bro dropped agenda there... cloth masks function primarily protect bystanders person mask, understand it.  also help protect wearer.  

An N95 mask valve functions protect wearer little bystander, understand it. Fauci, Public health experts said Vaccine likely Widely available return normalcy around summer/fall next year. Soviet Russia, comment chains YOU! people shelter themselves. point see rest us suffer it. know median age COVID death? could mistaken, seems lot serology reports find high percentages people Covid antibodies tend densely populated areas.

If I'm mistaken, could ramifications...

1. Obviously, people would exposed virus areas densely populated, especially areas public transportation like subways, buses, etc used thousands every day.
2. amount asymptomatic infections cause concern still contagious. virus could spread communities/ groups less prone developing symptoms do, symptoms could mistaken seasonal allergies person go way get covid test for, could go undetected weeks stealthily spread vulnerable communities incubation period ends, thousands people could start showing symptoms moderate-severe disease short period time, potentially overwhelming medical facilities infrastructure raises fatality rate medical resources overwhelmed. could explain explosive outbreaks China, Italy, elsewhere come seemingly escalated quickly. \*\****THIS IDEA MINE I'M VIROLOGIST MEDICAL EXPERT, INTERESTED TOPIC, FEEL FREE DISCUSS, CRITICIZE, ADD THOUGHTS\*\****
3. Exposure lower viral loads may lead antibody formation, milder/ asymptomatic cases, necessarily complete even partial immunity virus, study research needed regard. America's fault somehow. 211k people died trying live lives too.  fucking murder. 1. Covid19 much less deadly plague (given access medicine time. Plague much less deadly today given antibiotics exist)
2. plague renaissance overlapped temporally Europe. Renaissance hardly period ""artistic drought"" It’s East Asian countries, wanted point Australia New Zealand also well even though considered western culture too.  didn’t cancel mine, haven’t gone. Mine good end next July credited time bonus month. paid full would getting portion back. don’t want cancel mine they’re selling new passes want able go next year. already got money’s worth is. also weekday select prorated refund would get back wouldn’t much all. 

I’ve watching vloggers though lines aren’t long. there’s fast pass, fill queue space. criticism capacity increased, wait times gone up. favor COVID restrictions? Cases positivity rates. gives idea many people got bad hospitals gonna get hit. Yes, deaths absolutely matter focus deaths tell story Covid. countries' healthcare systems verge collapse Covid that's killing everyone. Nope Hawaii gotten away it’s illegal enforcement nobody else. Also realize it’s honor system right? Yeah I’m pretty sure company violating guidelines clinic place tested inform employees employer this. really don’t get companies think endangering health employees making work helping either party. Makes sense. can't imagine anyone thinking cool. Especially matching mask. ever dookie hard ears pop? Good luck cancer diagnosis. There‘s significant lag. According Robert Koch Institut, it‘s 17 days first symptoms death. Add incubation time, get lag three weeks. Also, look cases deaths peaked second wave US. month peaks. Yeah Summer 2021 see return normalcy. enough Vaccine go around Wow, imagine bad would already vaccine. nobody getting tested probably means almost nobody virus claim artificially low case counts baseless false. people like want virus rampant widespread really is? confusing. 40 km/h 24.85 mph NGL, lady red looks like bad ass GI Joe villain. enter buildings? instance, groceries doctors office, etc?

Yep. try stock up, try go folks risk there. 

The main way I'm careful taking chance infecting love. 

I'm looking forward Covid-19, think pretty inevitable I'll get it. feel you. you’re aware trump misquoted president ever right? Also president severe media coverage bias ever. 

This man got rid top generals, pushing agendas years pushing around previous administrations like Obama. 

This man called intelligence community. know kind enemy intelligence community become piss off? Since 60s they’ve known influence public opinion one way other, they’re partisan. whole Russia collusion thing dominated first half presidency, became declassified source info Clinton campaign, US intelligence. FBI ran even though knew fake. addition Obama/biden administration OPENLY spied trump campaign (based Clinton’s false accusations collusion) continued even elected! 
So hate trump personality demeanor... hate cheaters.. dirty liars cheaters say anything power vote. BLM funds haven’t gone back black communities, fact first thing join network DNC funds give democratic campaigns across country unlimited access $billion+ BLM misleadingly collected. left disgusting. Sure Trump asshole, know this. there’s way bigger assholes left. Assholes want make radical changes fundamentals country.. personal gain. Don’t go feelings, go facts. 

If doubts, implore fact check may confirm info yourself. trouble help out. divisiveness country rooted perpetuated left lurching media.  predictions also failed quite hard before. heard weeks ago well ifr 5 times flu people cannot trusted behave without lockdown ever conspiracy subscribing here.

This pure intelligence self control issue. intelligent enough understand science, self control act understanding, would much better shape.

But no, trying make things worse. I’m curious find much money actually collected fines like pandemic with. think lot get reduced even challenged court.

$15k lot, least it’s like $400k fine one guy revived supposed drive Alaska sightseeing Canada instead. live virus without living mass outbreaks overwhelmed ICUs, look Sweden Germany. Sweden never overwhelmed hospitals--at one point even taking patients countries!--and Germany ensured would enough ICU beds needed. Ok deaths don’t skyrocket next week we’re good?

Btw don’t mean skyrocket way media defines (an increase 1 more), I’m talking actual uptick excess deaths. Actually wish two separate things Hahahahahahaha think pinnacle truth!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA fucking moron! could basic virus everywhere mutation Wuhan particularly infectious problem that. That’s easy cheap solution, government would provide housing meal delivery elderly people currently live family members work (a huge percentage elders US). would cost lot take lot longer set think you’re aware.

By time program actually isolate protect elderly set funded, pandemic may waning already. mean, didn’t, since we’re talking US whole (which clearly isn’t right now), yes elect in. simple easy things protect others cost US dearly. rookie numbers Czechia 5500 yesterday population 10 million. great choice. cAsEdEmIc!?!?! course would wait major first world health agency monitored trial.

People got tired rules, quite sceptics, deniers conspiracy theorists lower temperatures. lot low level clusters escalated now.

I'm honestly surprised took long. Guess typical tourist destination spread among younger people first.
That also happened march probably one big reasons death toll low not. even close warrant lockdown. Hospitals feeling strain capacity. people getting infected bars restaurants.

Go back school man. Oh wait, get free don’t. ask Russia live?

I live Nizhny Novgorod, that's 6th largest Russian city (1.25 million) 400 km east Moscow. Basically, Central far tell, east Russia less western politics affect you.

I say so. Despite size, Russia pretty homogeneous, huge East–West divide. I'd say main divide large cities rural areas. rural go, poorer people become, less care anything surviving. City dwellers generally interested broad variety things, including global politics. travel more, buy foreign products, they're likely directly affected. example, I'm directly affected US–Russia relations want get new US visa, current situation makes extremely difficult me. 99% Russians ever need US know political aspirations, part hopes do.

I'm theoretical physicist, think fully diving politics would waste skills (although Dr. Merkel would disagree). I'm interested politics, try support opposition politicians, least donations. might get involved something local level states anyone going Russian politics automatically target head. think accurate?

Yes, degree. publicly go Russian government, constantly risk money freedom. fined jailed ~15 days nonsense time time, might get problems career studies (like expelled university), devices confiscated authorities, etc. unlucky, might get accused criminal offense jailed longer time. rare cases, become noticeable troublesome, like Navalny, also risk health life. That's risk one takes choosing path, there're illusions. dangerous Westerners think, Putin Stalin, straight kill every person opposing him, generally prefers using pertain going Putting?

If loyal Putin, get pretty far, far conscience allows. taking side autocrat really politics, that's like servitude. like get free comment karma comment r/Coronavirus.

Gee, seen Francois Holland one takes beating unpopularity stake well, phenomenal achievement macron glove puppet goldman sachs. seems increasing evidence disease far less deadly media originally assumed Live uncontrolled spread official fucking thing. live liberal county health department opened attendance sporting events. 400 new cases 1 week. Test positivity gone &lt;5 10. 

Thanks Bullock saying ""its county issue, Im dong shit"" Hes getting dangerously close losing votes BS. Isn’t bleeding obvious consequence first lockdown? Unless rigorously rest, accept collateral damage try build herd immunity, waves like keep coming every season. Lambeau allowed fans in, remotely blame. argument entirely circular. you’re vaccinating people risk pandemic literally ends death rate would minuscule, expected happen late year/early next year read? doubting relationship current cases/future hospitalizations, unfortunate circumstances, future deaths. use language. one questioning that. Literally everyone agrees correlation there.  


And continued bigotry assume others concerned health well-being around them.

But literally could nothing isolation.  Nah, wouldn’t that. It’s sunny country all. Cloudy grey skies much year. Probably due better overall cardiovascular health, maybe genetic factors. Dude talking about?

First all, saying Germany ""doesn't test post mortem"" straight lie. 

And based excess deaths vs coronavirus deaths Germany seems accurate reporting, perhaps accurate country europe.

Excess deaths statistics lie, **so much** worse France compared Germany, that's undeniable fact. yet y’all still recession prime minister admits y’all bunch selfish fucks propagating virus. yeah, city 1.5 million people less daily cases city. Probably citizens dipshits like yourself. nice day ! yet still explained is. Children men coming soon....


Prophetic pandemic even prophetic now. think tried reopen like dummies. way beat virus stay locked vaccine comes out. address anythign said entire thing said ""weird response lol""?

Listen, I'm trying understand punt trying make. make easy instead trying avoid it? Lockdowns work beautifully. Combine solid contact tracing, populace jerks, wipe entirely. cleared last community transmission case second outbreak. macron works goldman sachs job make sure photocopier Goldman Sachs never ran a4, married molester. use covid never mind covid? French probably already thought disaster soon positioned power like glove puppet - know it. weird, country fraction cases States per capita. TIL canada dictatorship Counterpoint: defy logic Europe needs take virus seriously. don’t wear masks? mean trapped room fire anywhere probably die anyway.

Not necessarily nearby neighbors call help. fire responders minutes away. 3 months he's going complaining isolation dangerous covid.

Foresight strong suit people. Fuuuuck. I...don't. I'm asking question I'm baffled statement. defies logic - hence asking explanation. able shut border Italy helped reality, country trusts china contained properly. 

Countries close China trust single word CCP says monitoring Wuhan much earlier. 

Africa young population allows infected show symptoms. 

Latin America reporting record numbers. 

Canada also started showing spike Toronto shutting things again.

Middle East international foot traffic EU America.

India can't anything population density. probably work pretty well. issue jersey Chris never ""important"" enough get dose. recession, curve bent. Given husband “late summer” (nothing specific), whispers offspring two Rose Garden party might participated super-spreading event there. too, hope winter. shit seems impossible contain unless eradicate completely. even makes occasional comeback frozen fish. waaaa? know dumb investment might well burn money. 200 years gone dumb investment Tell covid cases trumps fault American kind stuff happening world? parents brainwashed idiots too... it’s better get intentionally give yourself?

Also exactly moving goalposts? authority controlling people here? Seems like authority side “hey let’s give everyone virus it’s big deal yolo” honest.  Drunk drivers kill people time, third grade teacher’s father killed drunk driver, think know someone affected didn’t come policy. She’s job. piece shit. Ideally never reopen Broadway. I'm obese, I've also working whole time, front computer, work pretty stressful. We've going many hikes manage (3 week, walked 4 miles yesterday), I've lost pounds. need somehow.

We started eating low carb recently, maybe help. full keto couple years back lost 45 lbs, triglyceride cholesterol levels got dangerously high quickly gained weight back some. work people wear them. biggest problem I’ve seen even people take masks seriously public let guard take masks around close friends family that’s biggest spread happening aside workplace. going winter look season early March? Like year started US. here. live transparent March/April. advise ill person stay home, self isolate seek medical attention needed. knew mild COVID-19 people radar, okay back then. neither test treat them, bother?

Luckily different now.

But: Numbers Europe still grow exponentially. stop sooner rather later. Nope. you. Sure real problems, also bad excuses. can't compare numbers wife similar line work really feel you. biggest issues running performers tour, kind licensing issues internet broadcasts, money major infrastructure upgrades facilitate it, anyways (just getting internet coverage allow credit card transactions entrances big accomplishment). county vs. state health health department, vague guidelines, liability.

And big one even normal year, donors advertisers keep things going, ticket revenue. kind businesses would normally cut $50,000 check local restaurant would $1,000 catering free, can't right now. 

The entire model broken right now. Hospitalizations also rising quickly, around 1k start September, 4k much noticeable positive slope: Basically story lots European countries. we've entered fall. Fuck me. Czechs champions giving fuck :D

Unless do, give fucks. usally not. Opening fall? season cases viruses tend rise? open till Q2 2022 bare minimum. use power point presentation Holy shit batman. Starter: study critically ill patients COVID19 - 14% (701) cardiac arrest, resuscitation attempted 57% (400), 12% (48) survived till discharge 7% (28) normal near normal neurological function discharge. common cause cardiac arrest non shockable rhythms (abnormal rhythms cannot shock someone of). 

Implications - cardiac arrest critically ill patients COVID19 high mortality. isn’t surprise anyone data discuss patients valuable. group somewhat selected 43% patients cardiac arrest preexisting attempt resuscitation requests - strongest predictor increasing age. Initially discussion broadened resuscitate orders - study suggests selected patients (young healthier patients) reasonable chance survival though outlook dismal older patients. go. Nobody forcing you.  That's virus said. funny ""snowflakes"" offended point cancelling things Utah. Agreed, like going suddenly overdose day week, levels take time build safe range fairly large. levels get upto good amount, back supplementation according doctor recommends. people deficient, especially colder climates. forms vitamin take body converts active form needed, risk cut even more. look! Western Australian anything like restrictions east coast Australia particularly Victoria .I two weeks home Western Australia early April due unknown (to me) contact returned overseas travelers developed slight fever ( covid)and .Otherwise life mostly normal better good zero cases 6 months .

Just want say I'm pretty impressed bigger citys Melbourne Sydney held together there.The vast majority accepted restrictions needs done without much fuss self entitlement.The virus seems stuborn ,pesky hanging single daily didget numbers atm.Sydneys contract tracing work testing looks great here. forgot /s reason think vaccine somewhat effective overweight patients. Elderly patients problematic immune systems often worn out. many intelligent individuals america yet u guys voted trump thats confusing mean drunk driving danger punished? think sure... rules got broken limits sometimes bad outcome. Idk mid 30s... Maybe young maybe old? 

I know Smoking laws increased taxes decreased amount smoking. Sorry englisg

Maybe written confus/incoherent? call can't hear COVID cough, make sound? case triage much better. People give fuck high risk die, people risk bunker people care care build immunity. 

Some people wanna bunker up, go ahead. make everybody it. One largest measles outbreaks linked Disneyland. know theme parks possibility super spreader events.

The parks stay closed. energy companies aren’t donating Dems... That's one way find herd immunity works states already removing restrictions don’t even vaccine antibody treatments yet. It’ll take little bit roll out, end Q1 2021 look lot different now. aaaaand successfully today - 1487. wonder fact comparison. Sorry family understanding. We're lot phone calls. know holidays make harder. gets cold rainy people willing sit outside us, that's place I'll sitting. step mom called last night. DNC chair county, highest per capita covid state. wanted opinion keep volunteer poll workers, monitors, driver's get vote safe - felt really bad. can't even require people mask vote. considered voter suppression. Nonsense, 0.4%. Dude currently sorority. house LOCKED bc national oversight could get closed much hang many people. Everything online, events person. Don’t lecture sororities like. I'm concerned area restaurants. restaurants done best fit form outdoor seating stay open. weather getting cold snow soon. push people eat inside, especially given real quarantine fatigue mention. good second wave strikes. Lmao happened “justlovehumans”? honesty don’t care think I’m stupid, know believe society mature, courageous flourishing. want crush good society it’s you. don’t act surprised everyone around appears idiot except you. might hint. \[Documentary short\] 

[American Pathogen: Full Story Trump (Published NowThis News, October 2020) * predictions come true, Bill Gates talking ass
* predictions come true, *that sure convenient*, doubt part masterplan, Bill Gates must infected people 5g microchip vaccines [There won’t publicly stand (at least *after* he’s fired thrown bus) they’re either A) scared he’ll tweet ruin career, B) terrible people think he’s useful idiot accomplish conservative goals, C) above. Yeah anyone still listening guy. know **if** want suppress cases. clear many people would rather take risk. That's outcome needs discussed. also last time, evening lockdown, soo yesterday, bars packed people. scenario last time reduce testing get cfr high want.  current rates, pace reach 300k deaths end year - that’s stretch. 

To get 400k end year need average 2,169 deaths per day starting today. 

Things need get bad quickly get 400k. even gone college?  Sororities social events non sanctioned parties. also hiding test results go isolation dorm. never stay comfortable level unless permanent restrictions, sustainable. shutdown buys time, goes right back again. it, anywhere near anyone else unless be. need wait least 14 days undergo contact tracing, etc. 

If going gym within 14 day time, danger everyone come contact with, including father. 

 
Wearing mask factor know COVID-positive.  


It's easy question: want take chance responsible possibly indirectly killing father indirectly, wait 14 days resume life that? That's insane. Russian vaccine phase 3 trials involving 40 thousand people. population Russia 145 million people. Redefining words special meaning creates real life problems, it’s even reasonable expect professionals institutions fix problems you. woman female females gives birth. definition woman that’s isn’t pile sexist stereotypes. Doctors aren’t telling wear lipstick want acknowledge female, it’s biology. 
trans activists spent years able create legal fiction biology surprised screws care. Half arguments based nonsense like myth every trans person reproductive biology removed biological sex somehow real certain. got ideology enough get pregnant Robert Eads still ovaries. Biology real making legal fictions doesn’t actually help anyone. Here's problem. people advocating reopening U.S. plans fund put stuff place national scale. things need place anything else happens end delayed spread vulnerable anyway. national home delivery program available seniors 1/3 Americans carry high risk conditions? national senior hours mandates? National N95 supply vulnerable? National temporary housing plan multigenerational households? anything, exposes advocating reopening absence measures cruel and/or measures protect vulnerable central aim public health responses COVID-19. way example, nursing homes use staff acquired immunity perform frequent PCR testing staff visitors. Staff rotation minimized. Retired people living home groceries essentials delivered home. possible, meet family members outside rather inside. comprehensive detailed list measures, including approaches multi-generational households, implemented, well within scope capability public health professionals. anywhere else mostly... Idk high blood pressure good. nvm gf really important (all people also tbh gf main purpose) Thats signed 1daysooner (human trial get vaccine afterwards get purpose infected). think need would take risk. let wait lf need talk negative topic stay (not corona) positive. one day everything fine again, let many possible experience day. Wake late. every step could find something wish for, forget gift alive right now. Yes second vulnerable people opportunity get vaccine anything stop anything more. over, I'm getting life back anyone complaining suck it. Nope Two reasons:

- Madrid overrepresented new cases deaths national level.

- regional governments taking measures accord, following national guidelines. example, Castilla León locked cities León Palencia. However, regional government Madrid refused comply, forcing suspension previous measures court. Without proclamation State Alarm, central government can't legally impose measures Madrid. Nobody gives fuck anyways... Black (death) Friday. Shame thinking deaths deliberate mourned for. It’s global fucking tragedy every country trying best. 

Have humility immaturity lack understanding mean maybe shouldn’t label people perpetrators mass homicide. Jesus christ. Human trash. Trump making masks political issue probably killed lot people. still unwilling say wrong. need eat. went period like barely ate anything lost weight. period ruined metabolism I’m overweight can’t seem go back average weight. understand pandemic gone maintain restrictions eternity vaccine? overall death rate compare countries neighbor them?  important clarification mask wearing people get infected lower doses virus, giving immune system time adapt. it’s okay also stopped tracking properly many places it’s okay /s Imagine many aren’t lying about.. worry, we've moved goalposts ""kills you"" ""life long crippling illness"". what's prevalence latter? one really wants say, afraid anyway. FEAAAAAR! GHOST NOISES! coronavirus proves test intelligence decency. customer failed miserably, seems good company around 20-40 % people country. people like this? Seriously, this. much doubts vaccine - haven’t claimed given population yet, right? worked phenomenally well drunk driving smoking. must young. Cept people japan actually follows government guidelines. government guidelines unambiguous. They’ve prior experience dealing SARs avian flu neighbors. aging population recognizes seriousness risk better. US Southern Hemisphere mostly Trump country. Big difference. Sounds right. type person refuses follow restaurant policy give damn fellow humans piece shit.

People wearing masks public scientifically-illiterate morons, assholes both. I'm saying stupid, I'm saying there's proof aren't. think approach Slaoui taking good might wind quicker - he's saying apply EUA millions doses manufactured ready go - way there's disappointment lag announcing EUA actual availability. Great job! That's big accomplishment. Keep up! Take care stay safe. well, considering around 8,000 people dies day bring perspective Covid death deadly people think. Scientists different definition airborne. distinction less relevant rest us. distances mentioned public health standards science; back April Japanese research showed virus travel 28 feet indoors really helpful anyone allowed go grocery shopping all. slander I'm tactful true. I'm saying sense people stake health. see comes way. I'm saying sense ongoing theoretical science formed public policy. 

Politicians, clinicians leaders general making decisions people, patients, constituents real life based scientific opinion Lancet focused one facet complicated society. take information one piece much larger puzzle.

So general public worry types opinion pieces journals implementable policy. see, take care happened here, still dangerous 2000 cases 1% lethality terms deaths 4000 0,5% lethality. apply military triage let people make decisions. Fatality lags, still can't people understand areas people social distancing, washing hands wearing masks, expect flu far less. areas feel wearing mask rare, think correct flu could compounding effect.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* evaluate actual track record combating disease case see worth listening to. lot critics discuss failures agenda, yet downvoted reflexively whereas people promote Gates uncritically critical US administration's response.

Gates unaccountable billionaire seeks influence public health policy globally. largest funder United States. make people critical, less.

As Musk analogy, reason let Elon Musk set transportation policy run space programme. He's car manufacturer rocket contractor. hope see difference.  Yet.. great United States, rich poor right die sleeping bridge. Yeah buy either. Unless they're going explain came outlandish conclusion, I'm going ignore it. 4000 Chinese 3000 American enters Korea every month. Yet, China exports 5 cases 4 months whilst US exporting cases Korea almost daily basis not. people caring anymore.
Why think covid surged southern hemisphere beginning year?
Same India.
Once restrictions lifted, Europe went ""second wave"".
Then, Southern states surging Summer.
Flu viruses that. think Fauci probably giving projections based current policy case rates, gut feeling low ball. States roll back restrictions compounding factors like increased homelessness evictions feel like could make look overly optimistic. Exactly - point specifically? doesn’t?! Well fuck, least I’ve enjoyed weed I’ve smoked last months. Lol ain’t rocket science... I’ve advocating masks since January bulk America thought crazy 🙄

They claimed science China flakey lacked sample data...

Maybe million lives could’ve saved weren’t stuck shitty politics ideas...

Even fricken shitty facial covering bandana FFS Thank you,I appreciate kind words. Golf fwend!

Seriously, one actually friends Trump. another asshole sucking king asshole get shitload money. want accurate number? goal somehow use beat Covid￼19 Czechia? IMO would cheaper putting population cloth face coverings mixing others enclosed spaces couple months, repeat needed vaccines mass supply. published data looked really good. fact using proven technology makes really optimistic something positive come this.  Er, no. Like, no.

The city live locked pretty hard, tested widely, got cases control. Restrictions slowly eased, active case COVID 90 days.

New Zealand locked down, got cases control, protocols place rapidly respond outbreaks. Restrictions country since eased.

Like... hard.

Edit: Downvote want, snowflakes, stop right. know hearing countries better America hurts freedoms, that's problem. mean numerical sense. number infected low, families one way make noticeable impact. One super spreader event could quarter cases. Thanks! think US election passes we'll see talk vaccine die down. Lots stuff said political reasons right now. viable vaccime maybe summer 2021 earliest. already plan 2021 another wasted year, even vaccine arrives take long time distribute enough make diff can't wait secret service walks white house next year lol. better insider information Japanese government. [Much Peru cold dry year though Iquitos (and cities Amazon Brazil Colombia too) got hit hardest within Peru, I've wondering months whether fact climate anything Peru overall hit hardest South America. Lies /s less 6% die covid else covid.
Our leader says so.
'I'm perfect physical specimen I'm extremely young. I'm lucky way,

/S could still seasonal effect. November would begin see severity increase seasonal.  That's said. said guy would wasting gas driving one shops Lowe's HD gives shit support. 
People go stores get need get out.

If wants make change vote. Boycotting HD getting Trump office lol Thanks I'll talk whatever damn well please, internet stranger. 🙄 CDC know coughing sneezing primary transmission vehicles back April/May said expressing symptoms required mask?

And CDC know saying said week ago virus airborne? Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego better claim governorship point. Thanks explanation! yet I've seen people argue IFR 0.1% ""Do pray easy lives gentlemen. Pray be.. stronger men"" - JKF (Black Ops Zombies). correct. maybe 3 million year? even notice media cover it. cost cost benefit equation. accepting cost supporting draconian lockdown measures world crumbles ignorant, juvenile evil. know nothing me. see project well. reads like plague Inc. News update tell every school district several cases. (South-central Illinois). dont know reaches outbreak levels, surprised shut schools yet. might consider subtle shades gray, room nuance.

The sad part really cut cloth people hate, lack self reflection even recognize it. easily manipulated swayed. I'm sure funny sad.

But easy manipulate vitriol. People die every year. Shocking we’re focused now. Considering it’s happening forever That's said ""once vaccine widely available"". Also FDA requiring vaccines least 50% effective, 30%. that's minimum. Pfizer vaccine candidate, example, gets strong enough efficacy signal first interim analysis, mean vaccine least 77% effective. That's pretty good. Changes mask science? Mask science hasn’t changed understanding airborne easily transmissible disease changed went forward realized Americans wouldn’t couldn’t stay put best measure defense had, hence changed recommendations. recommendations public changed it, president political party purposefully chose discredit divide. There, it’s turn. Fingers crossed! /s? virus somewhat stayed capital, aim keep way  I've heard federal mask mandate might unconstitutional (while state local mandates not). Regardless, White House recommended states mandate masks. certainly going work attitude. requires public confidence state competece complimenting other. course there's risk, reward approach great worth risk. Yes, sick dying first. sick weak always vulnerable plague disease, mean acceptable let die, especially still years life left them.

A lot Americans seem understand whole point society band together may protect weakest vulnerable, even strongest knows weak vulnerable point.

Letting weakest vulnerable die betrayal fundamental reason society. Come man! looked worldometer's stats? Sure is... comments answers questions? Everyone? Two people. Better suck up, rally 2 days prepare for!! Trump bears plenty responsibility letting every state go individually without federally coordinated mandate, playbook thrown out. Trump bears plenty responsibility knew seriousness February purposefully played down. Sure, Fauci’s recommendation wasn’t put well recommendation also changed leader listened scientists we’d nation followed changes betterment well. call however want president large. Tell Florida. seems physically OK despite virus think actions speech erratic. Wow that’s serious. DONT WORRY! COME FLORIDA. COMPLETELY OPEN! CORONAVIRUS? like BORONAVIRUS! miss football? WELL WEVE GOT FULL CAPACITY BARS STADIUMS! miss theme parks? OPEN! say wear mask public, that, say “MASKS OPTIONAL.” - gov desantis... /s 14 flatten curve. people like ""okay flattened, what"" Rodents allowed spread plague. One requires unprotected sex requires vicinity of. 

And fined currently most/many places quarantining happening chief. mm mm cod livers yet gained seems. understandable though--not able get house, people spend day night couch watching Netflix, ordering takeout, stress-baking cooking.

Even lifelong thin friends gone pounds many months lockdown. hard read lay book topic expertise in. book definitely flaws, someone done cell culture based research, answers ethical questions, personally I'm comfortable using HeLa cells using animal models, I've done lot research involving animals.

 good starting point conversation around ethics involved biological research. think that’s good portion military’s budget goes to, darpa driving force behind innovation shadows. EVERYONE wear mask 6 weeks gone 1) statistics, odds massively favor

2) pumped medications including experimental antibodies

3) let's wait see, Herman Cain took like 5 weeks succumb

Edit: despite he's claiming, looks actually quite sick Well, Florida opened back everything so... work, young care elderly. young work vulnerable. 

We never could isolated vulnerable, that's fake strategy. *head National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases (NIAID) member Coronavirus Task Force*

Apologies...only member leading spokesperson.

Or ""just Dr""? confusing. Hahaha.. Someone's salty. 😆 Ive seen people wanting 30% capacity limit. types numbers would problems everyone leaving time, people grouping together concourse going get food, drink going piss.

Then problem thousands congregating outside ground local pubs kick off.

At least seater stadium try keeping people part comes watching game, good luck trying get people socially distance standing terrace League 1, League 2 National League stadium.

I see Holland allowed fans stadiums quickly went back fans cases started rising.

I miss going games, allowing fans stadiums cases surging bad idea Worldometers shows 344k 7th 349k 8th. new records. Fridays typically higher. vaccine available. damn Post locked. Play stay civil. didn’t national plan. states didn’t even start social restrictions let alone end soon. China, WHO, vaccines? disaster written Whoever made headline needs learn connotation “scheme” *cough* Florida *cough* Imagine thinking don’t need mask despite going bar; one worst environments covid. 

Lol @ assuming extroverts silly. America never get pandemic..  problem United States system universal Health Care No, Like band...Pinball Wizard, Generation.... Etc. brain eating parasite would starve fucking die Yes, they’re shit hole countries like ‘Murica. Ngl went twitter today first time check posting. was. shit ton. left defeated. knows really posting. Trump found nest Umm except gov Ducey never mandated masks. local ordinances, initially blocked. April May reversed allowed masks mandated localities state.

Ducey roadblock state's response, currently push recall him, fully support. mean 'murica?

You really intent honest look. angst anger coming out.

There dozens countries vast majority mask up. cannot reason position didn’t reason into. Yeah, talking about? Perhaps reference *future* lockdowns. He's definitely done shitty things past, I'd take Dicey someone like DeSantis day. why? work restaurant Phoenix. People literally wear mask outside moment enter restaurant store, drop mask neck. logic makes sense me. Also I’ve noticed trend people don’t mask ask wear one, say “oh forgot mask” hoping we’ll let slide. right tell can’t enter without one, Lo behold pull mask pocket purse. Everyone mask they’re refusing wear it. That’s school feels like. Students sit three feet apart long everyone wears masks, even though don’t wear mask properly we’re constantly telling keep distance. I’m tired people pretending we’re protected masks. Btw, didn’t bother reading article. symptoms Rose Garden Event appears patient zero. america actually one mask compliant countries world.

just there’s official mandate y’all take don’t wear them.

something like 65% americans said wear masks, that’s par asian countries.

japan anti mask protest. Damn see there.   say “Sturgis”? gonna get worse next months flu season coming around well. damn rally’s masks spreading throughout cities. College cities also hit hard. guys also one states lowest obesity (for US, anyways) younger average age. help little, too. bias towards poor life choices decisions. I'm AZ, bodies streets here. Fuck ignorance religious mask fervor. think figured many global scientists virologists 😂😂. Seems kind inevitable unless live bubble Rough translation: 
Government shus theathers cinemas 14 days least. professional hobby inside sports put halt. School attendance alternating two halves pupils. Universities go online attendance. 

All fitness clubs, gyms swimming pools closed immediately.

Restaurants pubs close 8PM, meanwhile 4 people per table allowed.

Shopping center food courts limited 2 person per table free wifi shall shut down.

ZOOs shut well.

Covid patients requiring special care placed hotels, could used quarantine centers cant quarantine home ither family members. think relatively low median age low income countries that's leading huge disparity--not bad data. 

We know COVID kill mostly old people. median age Canada COVID death 84, Italy 82 (IIRC), UK somewhere 80 84, pretty much developed countries. 

COVID mostly kills old people, countries support large populations old people sustain high death rates. bet could find pretty good correlation percentage population nursing homes rate COVID mortality.

I think there's mystery all.  Yep, Latin American countries huge discrepancy reported deaths excess mortality, factor 2-3. Even western countries find discrepancies 30-50 %. Though it‘s anyone's guess many unreported covid deaths many deaths due pandemic, covid specifically (not going hospital fear getting infected, overworked hospital staff, etc). I‘d say likely mix both. I’ve area Patagonia vacation. live Vermont southern area Patagonia makes VT look like metropolis look population per square mile. 

Patagonia amazingly beautiful though. Doug Douschey worst governer we’ve ever Arizona. people big push mask mandates. Let's say somehow contracted disease asymptomatic. get car someone else N95 mask on, much protection guarantee person car? Especially weak immune system different sickness. Basically, I've going gym often school drive dad somewhere jaundice right weak immune system. keeping N95 mask guarantee safety it?  ""I like heads security get gravely ill!"" AIDS:condoms::COVID:masks another one fweedum skeptics? looks insane photos. search dare. Read article - reduction happened measures taken - say mask mandate sole cause would agree measures, closures, nothing.  6 months, many 90 year olds would alive today? weird considering large ridiculously expensive golf courses. One would think would second nature. Disney layoffs probably lot it. That’s awesome! data I’ve seen people highest risk obese range you’ve likely already dramatically reduced risk. heart goes COVID-19. one deserves infected Stephen Miller. US undertesting/underreporting. Comparisons like meaningless. Thank Winnie Pooh /s US undertesting/underreporting. Comparisons like meaningless. What...? comprehending? lockdowns worked well flatten curve. Again, point wasn’t stay home over, keep hospitals getting overwhelmed, currently everywhere. Obviously UK re-exploring adding tiered mitigation’s, complete lockdown far I’m aware. impose brief partial lockdowns flatten curve enough hospitals handle patient load. know shit real ranks higher gun violence know whether social distancing *will* around (at least America), definitely *should* be. science telling you, I'm telling you: public health *much* greater importance brunch, sportsball, even (like not) Christmas. Now, I'm sure almost one likes skip annual Christmas party Aunt Betty year pandemic... I'm sure *no one* likes ventilator!

It comes government point; impose new restrictions, keep rowdiness American populace check. break social distancing anywhere America, break law. go! need - scientists weird mutation remote part earth. Comrade that’s exponential growth works look scale, it’s linear. even Fauci thought masks good idea beginning ended state run free testing sites area. also Shut testing due hurricane. reopened testing sites. Can't cases test. fully expect hospitals get inundated. groups people working together clean debris, also still tourists coming here. mess. 100% loss liberty, amiright?! pushes problem sustainable no, RKI says around 1% population ABs. Also dont see slowing F E.
In addition Schengen prevent Slovaks close border CZ. political another national lockdown empty threat? could one find complete raw data feeding reports? Trump like losers. like winners like himself. Christie staying hospital long loser. /s yeah mean really get logic throwing random anti-virals without actual mechanism action makes sense k one believes bullshit sweetheart 😘 Wouldn’t....this mean lockdowns work? never said that. Greek houses shitty. I’m simply saying vast majority locked well Greek life merits shouldn’t shut down. Why, want government charge health care want private companies / foundations charge health care, want? issue work Polio Malaria immunizations alone, help dramatically reducing childhood deaths world? hold opinion Rockafeller influenced health care? Quebec we've hit 1000+ cases day days now. cases day summer. Sad see unfold people still taking care. quarantine direct contact someone tested positive. Second wave sucks big time. CDC’s role standing sidelines White House says whatever want. Unfortunately. mandate anything I'm sure legal give legal teeth.

I'm Texas. Right now, I'm Vermont, 14 day quarantine policy. Flew last Saturday. lied everyone said I'd since September 15th. Everyone (mainly hotel car rental staff) took word it, nobody asked plane tickets evidence all.

Ya'll might think I'm terrible person goes show travel mandates legal teeth all. California's got right closing things tourists actually want do. Either way, next 5 months crucial. ""The spike cases happened France happening across Europe.""

Across world, actually.

Hong Kong boasted ""beat"" virus, yet came back multiple times. New Zealand, too. Australia. South Korea. 

Hell, China re-lockdown several France-sized cities / counties / provinces several occasions less dozen new local cases, assuming believe totalitarian government. Vote comment up, please. too. People care. Good strong argument. 

Do source make up? call. Turning tide sure 1k cases/day stubbornly high still. can't one thinks red trench coat cool? love Devil May Cry Trigun. honest really sounds like measures taken (not Czechia) mid-March. sounds like second lockdown me. That’s messed stupid. Government officials multiple departments interact people White House time. First White House, Pentagon. branch government going next? What’s 7day average? 5% People 7day averages evens spikes data inevitable result statistical sampling. currently sorority. house LOCKED bc national oversight could get closed much hang many people.

I guess virus going Greek Row articles fake since locked well. contention ridiculous comment 2020.

You excluded discussion statements. grown yet? Actually, average age death covid higher average death rate countries, suggesting many elderly likely survive much longer. Surely death death matter what. example, would comfortable friends families dying cancer pneumonia? really strange thing people seem attach higher negative value dying COVID say, AIDS cancers. that? Buy out? Trump already owes 400 million Tsk tsk tsk... that's get alot tests. known better. 

/s Yeah are, nothing changes though, nobody forcing behave otherwise. think tips people dining much. Also, tip pick food. dining though tip, intentionally asshole. Yup, live Ontario keeps getting worse. Keep expecting start going down, folks would see rise start responding better care, nope...still going up.

Edit : anyone honestly doubt approved? never said different European mutation, could saying different it’s original strain Yeah, family believed hoax, thought overblown, also huge Trump people. take seriously though. unbelievably sad situation though. aunt uncle parents cousin threw party, son even speak anymore anger throwing party. go either, begged parents throw party. Sure. weeks later get notification phones:

Oh one people hospital someone care can't visit.

Yeah... Sounds wonderful.

The point. think like we're Cali best way. gradual reopening. cases expected. prevents blowing up. course, would bigger dose like anything else. Today ""people use pandemic police activities like"" Nothing moment, sadly Oh cool it’s over...... COVID denial insane holocaust denial, ban arguing mask mandates? Masks marginal effect compared proper distance kept, mandating goes quite far. strict keeping 1.5m times important. Many despots, worse Trump. Shouldn’t humanity aiming little higher now? Damn ccp good brain washed bot? wait two weeks ! say tomato, say tomato... outside legitimately massive protective effect virus  already seeing numbers? thought testing still double-blind? able expect 80-90%?

Yes, I'm unabashed history checker, making good sense. we’re making stuff, expect portfolio return 80% 90%. FDA packed actual scientists doctors. approved, legit.

wait, that's wuhan, that's new york, lol Thanks much! I'm always waffling whether we're asking much enough. Truth told first referred early childhood services really fence whether needed it, he's gotten older I've seen issues self regulation, focusing, impulse control really catch peers. able socialize much due Covid certainly helped area.

But we're really lucky, issues mostly social/behavioral point, academically he's fine. stay home little sister dedicate lot time helping remote schooling. Things could much tougher.

It'll free insurance, cheap (probably $40/ per dose) programs assist uninsured need free. guess that's good “A preliminary study analyzed virus’ structure following two waves infection U.S. city Houston found contagious strain dominated recent samples.

And, course, many people actually vaccinated first month? first 3 months? I'm entirely unsympathetic. really bothers me, example, people try use ""literally"" mean ""figuratively."" think fighting uphill battle word ""logic."" mean, Webster's definition [200 years ago.](http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/logic) “A hostile science” wtf on? article states Bailey sick Covid Rose Garden incident.

It's like deniers know, started reopening last spring, would cross county likes rural towns less restrictions things like haircuts able eat restaurant maskless. local businesses went years got ignored following local laws requiring masks, takeout only.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* isn’t one damn expert world who’s saying beginning “everything go back normal soon vaccine available”. that’s impression layperson had, either need pay closer attention find better source information. It’s experts faults people coming crap own. Flu season nothing actual temperature. ""People!"" would accurate, spike cases happened France happening across Europe. timeline slightly different country, overall trend same. Looks like CFR goes even taking lag account. Could mix things: testing, lower viral load (mask), better treatment, young people infected. Times like shows whats inside people's hearts.

&amp;#x200B;

May diner enjoy last days 'mask free'. heheh!! mAsKs iMpEde FreeDom feel that. keep thinking “I cannot possibly wake insane news happened today,” yet somehow keep surprising me. *Dr Feelgood, King Medicine, Playboy Mansion.*

Yeah, signatures look totally legit me! plead something provably efficient instead, like meeting people? statement like this, right vote. Folks forget ""people"" ""Russian people."" Si le gouvernement ne prends pas des mesures importantes bientôt, je pense malheureusement qu'on sera débordés dans les hôpitaux. Pour l'instant ça va mais .... Jusqu'à quand? offering miracle vaccination nations, like month ago? agree, nobody trying say ""make lockdowns permanenent"" ""apply lockdowns universally risks"". society felt way, would locked years ago Ebola outbreak. clearly ""take freedom = saving lives"" making calculated public health safety decisions. alternative ""If X save one life, musn't it"" obtuse, neither real worldviews. lol. A. doesn't. Belgium Spain, several Latin American countries worse death rates, places Europe similar death rates. U.S. much different rest western world. done? Listened people like you? People like saying Sweden worst mandatory lockdowns. everyone coming around realize Sweden right.  


""people like me"" meaning people different opinion you? lol. countries successfully flattened curve control cases zero near zero. live one country. means sarcasm. Vraiment. selfish, evil thing people enjoy life pretend virus defeated. Okay buddy Ndtv Indian news source reporting China. also unreliable Indian news source reporting China.

As far factual reporting misinformation, NDTV like Fox News India. Remember there's still possibility bs number real one much higher. basically are. states never really united federal government always acted though state governments board selectmen small town. Regeneron 100% effective miracle cure every American access free. 

What's problem? flu IFR nowhere near 0.1%.

But importantly, logically incorrect compare multiplying; instead adding them. Since actions contain coronavirus equally contain flu, treat combined IFR (according you) 0.6%.

A COVID IFR 0.5% outside nursing homes pretty consistent everything else we've seen developed world. many nursing home deaths Chicago had? 1st graph really interesting. I’d love see result replicated elsewhere. already found come Wuhan, lol ""pack courts"" bit fool. Yes that’s said. point FDA hasn’t said finished reviews. Edit clarity: FDA review going take weeks, aren’t kind special approval first responders.

I skeptical local official promoting raising expectations. Sick reference bro

*Coughs unmasked deliberately one another* Well idk. ex worked server thai restaurant although theres shitty people making money software developer went school it. Looking reality.

The ""models"" using insane parameters. 10-20% infected hospitalized, 70% infected within months, etc.


None things anywhere close reality. little literally massive multiples.


At point probably less 1% infections require hospitalizations.

Models using rates 10-20x higher based panic porn. Sounds like lot tbh  Totally. 70s 80s like ""OK, who's least fucked up? see straight enough close one eye? Ok, drive."" *norm*.

But public education campaigns changed everything time people even dream getting behind wheel car 2 beers social shaming. one cared penalties. Gen X pretty much treated laws suggestions anything else.

Same reason cigarette smoking declined. one goes jail it, felony, popular. public education campaigns worked time. ... guess found Carmen Sandiegoski twice 4x amount. Sputnik ass LOL war Armenia Azerbaijan right now. Turkey also involved. Iran mobilized troops border.

And nobody cares. bet hear news Russia steps prevent Turkey annexing allies make Russia look like bad guy.

Russia done anything anti-American anti-European. delusional. Swallowed propaganda pill asked more. Yep, Japan allow people go places better them, saying much without destination allowing in.  Ahh, wanted verifiable statistics tongue-and-cheek statement culture verifiable data culture leading Utah county account 40% new cases despite making 20% population. Gotcha. EU consist many countries different cultures. Every country follows individual strategy, stop spewing hate. Thanks.

The US consists many states different cultures. Every state follows individual strategy, stop spewing hate. Thanks.  According nytimes 56000 October 8th.  Shocking. (Not really) Younger average age infection? maybe perfect time Catalonia try gain independence again, since government busy beating Covid protesters. AKA: Contagious ACB omfg Exactly. Bitterballen daily basis.  Lock downs cannot eradicate virus. Experts believe nations implement rolling lock downs, change Coronavirus flares different areas. Off-and-on lock downs need maintained vaccine available people's lives ruined. cost. pronounced exactly pronounced... ""Take everybody's money""

""Wait, taking money? I'm everybody"" 0.0% chance happening.

Are people really realizing click-bait era stories ""game changers"" ""vaccine soon"" stories total utter bullshit?


There going widely available vaccine year. 

Not AZ. Pfizer. Moderna.


The truth virus going infect lot people goes. pandemics end. would great could end one vaccine be. start, spread, lot people get, fade background. people accuse China propaganda... lol.  

Not saying China practice propaganda naive believe China one it. fact, probably propaganda China does.  think EVERYTHING protect ourselves. let's clear science, make sure things actually evidence-based know? Science denying state actual fact, Utah one lowest death rates country? Seems like one threatened science data. Difficulty breathing tends get doors hospital much often not. can, post history extremely unlikely. good Depending live, think reach local health department. advise risk needs tested/isolated provide information work. Unless boss works public health, think qualified make determination. Thank Well actually answers ALOT questions. SUMMARY
In Winnebago County, Wisconsin, perceived low severity disease outcome; perceived responsibility others; peer pressure; exposure misinformation, conflicting messages, opposing views regarding masks identified drivers behaviors might influence risk COVID-19 exposure among young adults.

What implications public health practice?

Identifying factors influence risk COVID-19 exposure framing messaging target factors could help persuade young adults adhere public health guidelines prevent spread COVID-19. Providing clear consistent messages regarding need effectiveness masks could help increase widespread adoption evidence-based guidance. Unfortunately mods removed it. I’ll laughing ass US hits 400k January 2021, brought assumed asking bad faith, question seem way. Apologies wrong. said, hard information find. Meanwhile Indian government left everything vaccine release Yeah hitting bulk later. taken months ago would different set states. months different set states. comes waves brain boy. real meaningful statistic overall state number deaths per capita. obviously going changes this, right now, mostly democratic states leading charge. Russians, know enemy South, right? Europe. Also Canada. “Covid fatigue” call it. 

“I longer care” called. Imagine ignoring lives saved lockdowns.

Man, I'm person typically open idea opening hesitant lockdowns general, comment stupid. Daily reminder virus originated China China kept secret rest world. crazy amount license plates NY, NJ, past week near FL. people vacationing pandemic?? 

Same Denver. said, there's statewide mask mandate here. Also, people often nostalgic times young, tend remember good things forget bad things.

Case point, ""Make America Great Again"", implying time greater now. greater time back criminal offense black man use toilet white man? greater women allowed vote? greater slavery still legal? long it’s anal slam... that’s gay.. allowed Russia start expecting everyone get flu shot, ridiculous many people dont. People reflect bad flu Unpopular opinion:

Spain performing bad. Spain ""luck"" world country received tourist summer, means 2nd wave started early July.

Since then, cases risen 10k-12k per day. lot curve clearly exponential, since mid September actually almost flat (and would decreasing Madrid).

This means Spain R0 slightly 1 long period time. lots regions successfully lowering 1 mild measures. means infection control (except Madrid)

On hand cases like Belgium, Netherlands, France, UK, Chekia Poland wave started early-mid September (2 months later) already seeing cases/100.000 Hab. Spain.

Their curves clearly exponential. means R0 way 1 short period time.

Yeah, Spain deaths currently higher deaths always come later cases (about 15-20 day's later) believe Spain high quantity cases/deaths situation control (except Madrid).

Yet countries, current death numbers low, infection rate (R0) control.

Issue countries learnt 1st wave measures imposed today slow infection rate 1-2 weeks.

(because due epidemiology today's positives infected week ago, means ,even magically get 0 infections today on, next week keep seeing exponential growth last week infected people).

So opinion countries mentioned worse situation (death people) Spain 20 days (unless Spain cannot control Madrid) issuing stronger lockdown measures deaths start show up.

Some high rate death ratios already unavoidable countries, longer wait, worse.

Countries like Germany Italy (which wave seems starting now) start placing minnor lockdown highly affected areas like Spain summer.

If want forecast countries deaths go pick country click 7 days average cases count.

Death 7 days average close 1/1.000 average cases 15-20 day's ago*.

* countries believe correctly counting cases/deaths. thought already vaccine? Well hard pressed find country cares less people Russia.  point herd immunity given, context choosing whether pursue collective strategies spread important point nonlethal virus within certain age groups, disingenuous believe university students spread vulnerable outside school.

People catch virus university students, go university, counted study. 1. Novel synonym dangerous. Covid19 novel. significant public health threat. nearly dangerous pre-antibiotic black plague.
2. Also plague bacterium virus.
3. Black plague novel black death pandemic 1300s either, caused outbreaks Well, new restrictions could work executed... guy known troll around way. love though. 1. lot kids behind, school not, need address that. 

2. daughter 1st grade. She’s made incredible strides year far. Oh boy surprised herd immunity due shortness immunity coronaviruses. never started America think. even subreddit dedicated specifically America tell American Reddit is, cause whole website American subreddit Nature probably watching Russia-Trump Collusion noticed one anything finally said: ""Fuck it, kill'em all"". Laughs 60 thousand cases day There's big difference pro-fascist simply saying ""Thomas Hobbes right"" know, known, time HCQ work. However, number doctors claiming works conjunction zinc AZT.

The question this: people still studies standalone HCQ? Amy Covid-Barrett Agreed. amount people asked business name ""tax purposes"" fucking absurd. Good thing cure, huh? live Ahwatukee. go grocery shopping morning now, right store first opens. people take seriously. afternoon, people still wearing masks, often incorrectly don’t give anybody physical space. Maaaan, suburbs Buffalo NY surveyed something like 70 percent people want person school. Funnily, city Buffalo superintendent said county wants every single student tested move remote school. 30000 kids. "" 11 countries regions include Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam Malaysia, Yomiuri said""

They listed 7 countries 1 region. Lockdowns work.

All put inevitable. covid wide spread right now? Less 100 million it.

It's perspective.

If every medical professional, first responder, nursing home resident took vaccine worked well case counts would crater long hit 100 million vaccinations. apologize well. low blow. felt snarky went bit. bad. cycling! lake anyone? ""[What hell Manhattan literally island, called ""Manhattan Island"" plus collection small islands. wANt gET pEDaNTiC. Thoughts and--oh, wait. got suggestions? come across yet! 

I'm aware r/Handwriting Eastern cultures = Hufflepuff Ravenclaw

Western cultures = Slytherin Gryffindor would prefer none got richer billionaires. Average age death everywhere I've looked *above* life expectancy. *maybe* death sentence folk long left first place. 

The one person know confirmed case 94 suffers Alzheimers, survived. discredited every post made sub, thanks saving mine other's time :) Indeed. actual count probably underestimated world, like calling ""lying"". 

Some countries definitely lying reporting real numbers. countries ""turning blind eye"" e.g. slowing testing. countries best tracking epidemic transparent it. said ""limited protection"" patients. yes, fair better without vaccine. That’s exactly happened US, people like “this surge cases isn’t problem death rates going down”. Then, death rates started going reduced incoherent babbling time argument reopening built assumption increase deaths wouldn’t happen. sounds like measurement issue. Like count test results 9th every quarter something. No, even 20-49 group, worse odds annual rate dying every kind accidental think trolling too, I'm bored enough reply.

I'm sure drug, iirc stage two trials guess we'll find soon whether wide scale Bill Gates one foremost public health experts world. He's focused lot time money Gates Foundation initiatives combating disease, poverty, lack education leads public health issues. still never told avg age Covid deaths US worldwide. claim statement false. keep talking graph. think cool graph tell avg age Covid deaths. keep going back name calling. answer questions solve problems. make note start this! percentage cases though?

You likely get proper answer question. probably joke Putin make win always. never admitted wrong...idgaf honest. never gave fuck flu deaths, since covid league unlikely affect don’t give fuck either. Chicago worst murder rate 15.5 per 100k 2016, average. number murders per year decreased since then. Cook county population 5.15M. 5.15M/100k 51.5 hundred thousand people. 51.5*15.5=809 people.

Coronavirus killed 5280 people cook county 7 months. Even murder rate quadrupled, people already died covid murder.

Your comment ridiculous many levels deserve response, maybe learn read data spouting random nonsense, maybe learn shut fuck up. honest people reddit seem Americans, go r/all mostly see American related news stories politics. Regeneron shit legit? Also, thanks answers. people think trolling guess. vaccine working out? I'd rather got richer billionaires, least he's giving away charitable causes, fight COVID. man. availability time

Can confirm personal experience. *Laughs UK* I'm sure ""democratic nation"" possible year 2030; building democracy fairly difficult process, Russia many people oppose that. I'm fairly confident current political system dawn fall then, better worse. happened vaccine? every day there's another news story police breaking 200+ parties teenagers masks.

Basically scientific method much higher stakes high school chemistry class as...? “Russia smashes coronavirus”

:)

“record cases 24 hours”

:( Nah, gets said incorrectly often. Everything requires policy political nature nearly everything. thing pandemic became strongly partisan. Putin SMASH!! Yeah absolutely, massive testing deployed immediately although think remember availability time. guess fake vaccines help aye Dutch people pretty healthy one least obese population Europe.  dynamic pandemic went down, people reasons believe situation improved. definitely thinking positively surprised virus returning vengeance. appreciate efforts. thought vaccine? America bad 🤬 Nothing less plague doctor mask me. *SCP-049 entered chat* Check excess death figures across world, genius  Shame fight completely avoidable. Wtf? PCR measure herd immunity? retarded? That's pretty low considering 1.35 billion people living Florida Man votes dumpster fire keep burning. News 11. mentions one name ""some stuff"", goes back mention name again. says brand like 3-4 times. think black white. two cents population large follow recommendations lesser degree there's also facemask recommendation. unclear lower degree adherence recommendations higher lower inpact possitive effects recommendation wear masks.

As spread decreasing since around late march recently, think right choice FHM stay recommendations without change. another situation would surpriced new recommendations and/or restricitions put place. That’s still lot Florida US troll think virus real dangerous... looked counter months noticed positive rates Europe higher ever. think people say widespread mean want get it. young healthy people, probably getting spring. person apparently never lived Midwest Northeast months December-March.... invited trolls post? No, he's corrupt crook. used confident czech communist secret police. CDC isn’t valid source anymore? stop releasing inaccurate death counts? Pretty sure closing eliminate transmissions them. literally job flattened curve. health systems get overwhelmed. always managing shock system. soon everyone forgets. Better odds lot activities... Please visit Germany. problem either. problem nothing approach likely move tiers quite frequently. ramp makes scheduling planning nightmare. robust plan. least opening phased manner allow folks continue working. Soviet Russia, Coronavirus catches YOU! Cases up. Hospitalizations up. Deaths soon follow. TIL asshole aka 'Jersey fighter' cure covid thankfully russia vaccine made 2 months ago chill He's 100% entire career. That's sounds like crackhead half time, rambling adlib speak. admitted wrong (Flu IFR \*is\* much lower covid IFR) still making super vague point? one suggested Covid dangerous 30s I'm sure trying prove Infection fatality rate never high.  Madrid. doesn‘t seem like heavy exposure first wave significant protective effect second wave. say ""seem like"", it’s still quite early judge. Every fucking time cases go up, moron sea lion trolls brigading sub. 🤦‍♂️ aren’t reporting numbers Per Capita??? course shit load people getting virus, shit load people!  Nah americans stupid. mean, smart ones, look average joe's Walmart. Nah, protests thousands people masks on. Wearing mask barely stops spread Absolutely, new england wasnt heavily impacted became ""vacation covid"" spots. Adirondacks NY, VT, NH Maine saw huge rises tourism eased restrictions. Covid already victoria lockdown 190 days end sight forget cowtowed Trump back April. listening mayors reversed course. many jobs human life worth lifetime disability one person?

I'm arguing incorrect choosing jobs, anyone argues never, ever respond numbers.

Let's say 20 people lose jobs one person die, equivalent? one bar closing, 0 5 lives one disabling lung injury? must acknowledge give gain specific strategy. 

The EPA actually puts dollar amount human life. to, put infinite value human life would sacrifice resources one person. believe right put value $10 million. 

How many bars that? think binder lower? Tell us number conversation. stomach admitting math, conversation had, opinion dismissed ""but jobs tho."" 

We agree economic hardship bad. using different ""pricing."" We’ve rash COVID denial/misinformation type posts crop lately sub, title worded way looks like one someone doesn’t RTFA, let’s clarify one posts. “Comorbidity mean COVID death” point article. fear it! weak Inferno? ""ally"" mean ""minion"" Yep interesting sub started allowing political content, yet current events justifiably made acceptable.

In March could predicted October White House top Pentagon brass would created super spreader events. damn ponds lot return golf balls I’ve sacrificed them. Yes, exactly. Municipalities closed businesses state, well. Even church leaders saying “Where mask fools”, many people like, “nah, don’t want to.” people regards consider high leadership divinely inspired; screw comes masks though. Lol would Indeed. Damn... Harsh browns, get it, right. end (let’s say 60% population 90% vulnerable ones), ok. feel excuse keep distopic measures longer.  could anyone possible foreseen coming. : talking need reception measures fall winter think means end winter? Maybe means within year outbreak? 

I don’t know model referring to. America search “megathread” comes first hit. sure it’s pinned anymore though. 

(On mobile, lousy formatting!) Vermont seems like kind place. Remote, lower average summer temperatures, liberal. read New Yorkers people surrounding states flocking low Covid numbers though. Gee wiz, perhaps masks effective! Obvious news obvious. might referring non-covid related ones.  CDC website shows covid deaths category called “accidents unintentional intentional, poisoning”. Something along lines. I’m genuinely asking means  Ughhhh, one campus (big one Arizona) wears them. idiots come school. Close 2000 total since September 1 read today. Looks like got unpinned. search megathread, comes up.  me, increased testing count we're talking Sweden's numbers?

For example, people point Denmark's numbers say worse Sweden... Denmark significantly increased number tests performed double number Sweden performed, half population - matter. significantly higher rate testing factor.

But we're talking Sweden's numbers... Florida alone lmao Poor leadership went wrong. mean less people exposed covid-19, death toll reduces default, no? UK: Pathetic Trickle practice/ We’re not, it’s 250 cases - we’ve put lockdown last week next month manage it. 

See happens government actually cares you? 

Keep trying little, petty man. around 1500/day london idiot PM told people enjoy evening cinema earlier week depends deffinition control. 
If therupudic meets deffinition probbibly next year. 
If talking cure rendering person immune peroid years goes several years never. 

That course also depends believe. one stick scientists opinions far working vacciene. opinion, Russia needs speed vaccine production. bad huh, closing borders south slowed doesn’t stop it. Wonderful, that’ll 2.50 don’t blindly follow leaders know right what’s wrong Dear... I’m Russian. live HERE. know I’m talking about, basis opinions. country wicked head toe, like America, difference America considerably money genius people make push many industries forward.

All said, don’t want start opinion war. provide arguments beliefs, I’m fairly certain head, try see deep roots go. People angry, angry government reason. exception.

And oh, knew war Armenia Azerbaijan since day began. hope government doesn’t decide play heroes step another war doorstep. I’m actually shocked well she’s done. went barely able read reading books night. Something clicked her. keeping home year. Well, aside using Excel first place. 13 days since event. say they've tested negative going test positive event now. overarching stupidity event close quarters without mask traveling state state, there's inherent risk attended event 13 days ago. America willfully diminishing value arts artists since Reagan 80s. virus pass. commitment rule law, protection individual liberty not. understand reasoning, meaning long lockdown parents stay kids people job cannot done remotely might hard time taking care kids.
When lockdown ended schools weeks left never reopened. take 20 kids room 4 5 hours day... mostly asymptomatic damage done. live parents might go work to. worse live grandparents.  Banon looks like racist asshole. hope enjoys prison! site provides pretty accurate daily testing, case, hospitalization, death numbers state condensed one place. media coverage pretty much either completely doom gloom completely denying big deal, gonna find much good shit there. use data site track positivity rate state time seems like useful info you. 

r/COVID19 focused new scientific literature constantly brigaded trolls that's another good place look. bad headline even article. littel eaction teh towns people one guy said still goes dancing lives life without mask...

So like ""Chelsea community reaction entire police department..."" agree terrible people's mental health, BP2 lack social contact routine lockdown fucked pretty bad back March-May. Young people getting education, crippled economy, lack life experience, elective procedures put held, cancer screenings checkups delayed, terrible consequences come measures.

I'm favor allowing virus spread amongst young healthy population vulnerable take protective measures different precautions ensure safety.

I facetious ""my body, choice"" line, true. treating everybody people allowed do?

If let young healthy people live lives, virus could spread start build herd immunity especially Summer people outdoors healthier winter. Leading lower cases spread going dangerous due everybody indoors vulnerable.

Now going Winter know fact places going want start locking again, crippling businesses, destroying mental health many, restricting people can't do, million consequences majority population high risk. 

The solution never ""lock harder"". delaying inevitable, we're heading winter. interesting see plays out.  absolutely nothing antigenic shift occurred Summer 1918.

The comparisons based utter shit. Everything could go wrong virus has. could play optimist could assume worst. assume worst, optimist virus, work out. Well, side it, say kids poorest ones who’s parents aren’t ensuring kids get work done. fully acknowledge it’s big burden compared drop every day, it’s child. There’s much I’m room them. I’ve set everything parents need go website, see assignments are, make sure they’re kid it. don’t teach them, make it. still don’t. 

I’ll put 120%, It’s genuinely unfair often teachers expected pick slack parents don’t want parent. Distance learning isn’t causing problems, it’s bringing light. Weird absolutely one predicting fall rise cases. could predicted outcome????? Spot on. would anything? contradicting lmao  Opening elimination, least TTI system cope went wrong.

Because possible.

There path eradication. course masks work still indoor dining/drinking, people going office.

Which like saying condoms 100% effective nobody sex. live real likely governments see grim hospitalisation data, shut everything down. choice.

Hospitals fine almost across globe. zero capacity issues still. Good. fewer 100 cases day, we're close 1000. daily cases three places. they're military dictatorship literally detain lock special covid ward test positive. That's like saying country big China manage control violent crime &amp; narcotics? lot things police state summary execution. Western country wants go path, save Russia. I've people suggest lack religiosity results chronic illness. can’t anything nice Yawn. boring waste time discredit points making chosen profession. care arguments data presents. Argue show faulty, job title. french bread baker Minneapolis wrote created linked dashboard, would make ounce difference me. Frankly, fact economist means likely better crunching numbers, looking at/interpreting data, putting context, honestly need right now. Show issues methodology, data collection. data almost 200,000 kids 47 states last two weeks September revealed infection rate 0.13 percent among students 0.24 percent among staff. That’s 1.3 infections two weeks school 1,000 kids, 2.2 infections two weeks group 1,000 staff. Even high-risk areas country, student rates well half percent. [\(You see data discount huge data point literally proves links source economist, lol. 

 believe holistic approaches real world problems based perspectives many disciplines, especially problem affects many sectors. many, many questions would like ask you. pertinent statement, alternative would prefer? harbor long-lasting fascination Russia I'm curious think would positive outcome. May ask attending family dinners believe person interaction huge risk? wear mask (n95) time, never going without one since March. past month I've wearing one wherever go, outdoor indoor. stop making stupid claims focus wrote.

People Italy wear masks. them, sure, quite large majority does. Oh, right. Secret Service falls Department Homeland Security now, formerly US Treasury. Yikes first claim. 

Source second? Los Santos. actually really well hear restrictions. chiiiia. Chynnnna chiiiijnnnnaaa. Travel Ban save millions milllions Worth noting testing lot countries using excel spreadsheet track new infections too? Remember Georgia? shit control? Wow.

Gross. Wait, suppose good thing? took parenting class called Circle Security discusses “being with” children difficult emotional times one key elements helping secure. sad angry, don’t try cheer up. Validate emotions tell know feel etc. moment. 

I feel like mindfulness really important aspect don’t discuss enough. present moment aware everything. Rather scared unpleasant emotions. Someone must brought back white house Covid BLASTS Russia week makes another FALSE CLAIM it! Death counts used important things. someone dies register that, continue getting pensions, example. much government wants hide death toll, price high, literally.

They lie causes death, that's irrelevant statistics. Billions dollars mean shit. magic. magically spend billions POOF CURE!

Also, lot money coming NGO Governments. lot Phama companies getting massive checks. get fund R&amp;D, production, get amazing PR, oh ""it works"" get savior.

Nobody idea work. Vaccine development often 10 years. Even 10 years pre-clinical work trials large number vaccines fail.

Ignoring non-viral vaccines gobbles money throw at:

HIV, RSV, HSV-1, HSV-2, ""universal influenza vaccine"", etc.

All failed.

While funding run original Sars-Cov-1 candidates failed.

The ""nasty"" cousin Sars-Cov-2 MERS gone years research vaccine. think. China got like 20 day Lockdowns effective, worked Italy, Spain, Melbourne, China, etc, etc. Opening elimination, least TTI system cope went wrong.

Of course masks work still indoor dining/drinking, people going office. Lockdowns end avenues infection.

Most likely governments see grim hospitalisation data, shut everything down. choice. would mean US Russia testing pretty much rate. Population 328 144 million. US edge slight one. Hopefully that’ll end COVID COVID restrictions all.

I’m talking pandemic, disease. economists bias simply based position, public health officials could still worse, different reasons. We've got infections every single corner many countries world ~6 months go prime conditions spread. I'm agreeing totally, I'll go farther--I think incredibly disappointing. change total mortality? Although, still short term study; follow-up, might some--though might go way hoping.  Wait? disagreed experts. saying data. Salt Lake hire per capita death rate per capita hospitalizations. want data please look cool website someone showed me: 


And say club district Salt Lake absolutely true. whether caused outbreak (hard say), true hundreds people packed clubs downtown Salt Lake wearing masks. lot mormons conservatives there, welcome check believe me. Anything high risk category remain closed notice. They’re low hanging fruit, sacrifice 10% economy save 90%. Would rather schools open bars nightclubs? no. US equivalent third world country see /s Well, 4 years ago world told half US were, apparently, Florida sure.... please burn clothes toss electronic gadgets they're tainted Chinese virus! Wow totally full nationalistic bullshit anything. 

Even narrow ""Russian government"", would claim something ridiculously easily verifiable product intend export? incentive lie here? Pretty much. poor souls make crap money put entitled pricks day. recent memory think I’ve tipped one time waiter constantly hitting girlfriend...like right front me. asked please stop...she asked please stop...but kept throwing crude lines her. left early. Paid tab left tip. instance get it. asshole doesn’t want wear mask? mean cmon infections way now, foment lockdown fatigue Melbourne. stipends come gas money you’re using Come man, first day reddit? Nearly everybody, especially popular threads, hateboner Russia Russians. Every kind obnoxious, moronic, disparaging lie eagerly perpetuated bored americans nothing better pat back echo chamber like one. Winter 'behaviors' already here. getting cold eat/drink outside getting dark early outside activities work. West maybe India getting like 100k day. original estimate 6ft safe conversation lasting 15 minutes. Somewhere along line, governments conveniently forgot 15 minute limit.

So go one drink might OK, drink fast... NDTV liberal left wing news channel India hates right wing BJP. like CNN. Lol bed getting crowded yet conservatives? I'm Canadian living overseas, feel like family back home take lot precautions. There's general feeling outbreaks happening elsewhere worry. cases never really dropped sustainable level first peak. dumpster fire! virus break globally. start somewhere spread there. pretty good idea started bat populations China. Researchers shown spillover bats happens fairly regular basis. Unlike last worldwide pandemic, communication abilities much better now. know China first large scale spread. spirals there. would rather see China set better tripwires early detection trying sanction China something happening along. know look. Get Trump outta office everything slowly go back normal. Read article closely. shows would get shipments vaccine November 10th. they're actually injecting anyone them. Though definitely think exact date dubious, surprised vaccine transported approval. death us part. Good Contagion, exhale you. Congratulations? part problem going go out. dictionary definition someone something like right would be: idiot. 

I'm hoping job something made say this, plenty others family members fought, fighting, fight disease selfish fools thinking defiance somehow sticking ""the man"". people lost, losing, lose lives selfish actions. say things like proudly, remember people empty spaces dinner tables hold personally accountable shitty way acted. 

Is really hard yall stay inside smoke weed year two science figures shit you? that's would actually stick ""the man"". need little slave ass alive keep living posh towers, make pay safety important. They've profited labor, infrastructure, sheer number bodies available work, buy, consume, otherwise distribute whatever product used amass wealth. Time reinvest society instead business, way society going - businesses last anyway. 

Sorry rant, people I've lost covid exactly mind yet. Reading shit like put everyone see straight hateful. Fuck you. fuck problem News repeated every day. author ECONOMIST, public health official epidemiologist even physician virologist. internal bias focused metrics concerning economic behavior, that's expected. would credence bio-stats researcher. ever heard immunity barrier? lol must really looking reason wear one. masks work, everyone wants hear causes minor discomfort see turns couple weeks. Assuming 2-3 week lag infection death seems work estimates I've seen 1% total IFR since average daily closer 1k cases per day couple weeks ago. holds true would suggest eventually getting 60 deaths/day assuming peak, close equivalent US numbers around 1k per day. Obviously IFR estimates change demographics gets infected. Sorry, going IFR rabbit hole today. fascinating stuff morbid interview discusses 5-6 months ago brought factory space begin producing treatments proven now. Studies misleading. Yes, eat tourists eat. Every single day. Healthy! I've burned many times these. I've stopped believing them. thought vaccine? [Around Singapore multiple bridges Johor Bahru, Malaysia. 

Your ""gottem"" quite land like thought would, huh? Surgis I'm going call year. Surgis Biker Rally become EU? lot people weighing saying worth it.. devils advocate another perspective? I've gone half dozen times year covid. I'm 30 visiting family live 1000+ miles away covid though so.. may little different someone whose older sees family daily.

To answer question though? youre like hate sitting next strangers waiting super tight packed lines yeah.. going absolutely worth it. think vacuum chamber fear reddit totally understand it. virus real deal scary. yeah, felt safe universal honestly did. Disney world? Eh.. feel safe universal man disney world worth park totally dead without cast members. sucks.

Universal great time though. Super cheap too. young willing take opportunity risk I'd say amazingly worth it. god get seat rides lines nearly non existent weekday. dream anti social among us. personally seen horror stories thousands people without masks.. really crack parks temperature checks, sanitizer, masks. hey, that's personal experience.

Ya know? Just.. selfish go hang bunch people wanna take risk after? Like said visit family luckily work home. 

Oh yeah! also sell comfy cloth Harry Potter masks universal god. So, wearing day sucks really bad honest. (P.s fear mongers... cloth mask sell works.. can't blow candle wearing easily.. calm down.)

EDIT: spelling. They've somewhat similar things, Putin saw rise Rush Limbaugh, Fox News like copying playbook.

[State-Run Russian Radio Looking Expand Lock up.

My right life important cult. People specifically told masks shouldnt worn hand washing touching face sufficient precaution. effect. 

People told kids could go back school safe without masks. effect.

People told longer required wear masks stores. effect. 

People told safe go vacation encouraged eat restaurants. effect. Brainwashing exclusive right wing media. 24-hour news cycle promotes identity politics fear mongering we’re seeing today. Humans aren’t meant much information thrown us, it’s skewing way perceive world putting wedge certain groups. CNN, Fox, etc. keep us engaged programming, inform us reality actually like. somebody gets treated antibodies possible would survive without creating memory B cells thus susceptible reinfection? many people fleeing New York Florida it’s crazy. concerns, well locals interact with, misplaced. ""OPEN EVERYTHING!!""

*virus explodes*

""HOWWW happen!?"" vaccine!!! People infected quicker interactions. You’re ridiculous. refuses quarantine protect best can. thought Europeans much enlightened us big dumb Americans.

Well :) comes problems, like over-confident arrogant. country (Ireland) got cases single digits summer. 

But false sense security thinking outsmarted virus came back bite us. Yesterday Ireland 502 cases. July 1st 6 cases. 

So yeah collective belief virus control American problem (which common belief summer) led people lowering guard, meeting friends, going back pubs. clearly over-confidence misplaced. hospital capacity possibly issue altruistic, forward thinking society nationalized healthcare 

Well nationalized healthcare mean better hospitals, means go bankrupt using them. hospitals many US States, without price tags longer wait times cases. I'd take muscle paim 24 hours able breathe properly + endangering family relatives. Tbh confident russian vaccine first, information looks quite promising. I’m sorry read story. “friend” acts way immediately life.

I hate this. incredibly stupid. Huge, virtual hug you. mean comment sound accusatory. meant mention there's probably another 5% *I've noticed* maybe trying well, e.g. mask + face shield. least area France, people masked stores sizes (from supermarket small deli). Bars place I've noped real quick. people put economy human lives?

I understand. Oh, media official counts public health agencies? Got it. get elevated temperature tetanus vaccine tried true old vaccine. Personally, even consider pain site injection fever day something worth concerned about. grownup suck fuck up. People interacting know (were tested? know sure) understandably feel unsafe around you. also still know long immunity lasts. immunity lasts six months spring, there's chance could catch time now. I'm also 99% sure spring (no test, lost sense smell taste week) still wear mask public buildings I'm self-centered asshole cares convenience possibly saving life. Russia remember level testing they're covering possibly new infected. I'm sure number higher. Yn Soviet Rousha, reycords smash you! Visitors Alpha Centauri vote Putin Yeah poetic shit sounds nice, know that’s reality Hey! one 40 000. AMA mean like every Jets season call republican. said support GOP. actively supporting GOP.

And oh way, anyone anywhere already fly California without quarantine period. Disneyland opening gives people incentive come already choose to. screams someone never visited Chicago seen outside news lol. Could easily caused contamination someone handling samples tested. never found anywhere else that's almost certainly answer. they're trolls intentionally spreading misinformation New Cases:

200 summer, 1400 three weeks ago = 7-fold increase

Deaths:

5 summer, 24 = 5-fold increase

Both 7-day average. exactly linear, comparable increase. Plus, never said ""should destroy society it"". Russia faking numbers Russia faking numbers? Go vaccine! Thank again, I'm showing humility right help people cope. OP hating, also ""love thy neighbor"" right? ambiguous saying origins similar the""golden rule"" also infidelity.

It's horrible thing see two big religions central Jesus. one brother yell hateful words like ""clarion call"" flesh blood? almost false case #s claim. wonder can’t understand initial post.  another example American anti-intellectualism hear about? think Bill Gates treated unfairly considering humanitarian efforts. people seem hate simply either he's filthy rich think somehow strong influence Windows now. donated freaking 35 billion dollars 20 years retirement. Uh less 1% wears lmao. sure Amsterdam recently lot people them. Ah yes alarmists, imagine wanting healthcare system collapse thousands deaths. Sorry alarmists self-centered. sorry respect love taking risks. considered licking lead paint? Heard great risk nowadays. Might interest idk.

I coworker literally lived Disney. tons toys, went every year. there’s many like them. don’t get  Followed science implies smarter opponents.

Followed empathy makes opponents seem like sociopaths.

Careful, brainwashed social media polarize view point. Republicans democrats different other. Social media would think otherwise. Yes. Life expectancy Russia around 72-73. I'd assume anyone age 75 dies Covid (or Polonium poisoning) simply reported natural causes. need confrontation--you've already destroyed within. 

The rest world already moving on... many seniors died pre-covid day Florida? flu hurr durrrrr live town recently reopened cinemas restrictions capacity. sometimes go crowded people tend sit apart can. ceilings high nobody talks. think people would go town small obviously save industry cinemas close.

edit: theatre cleaning may adequate covid hygiene, tend dirty. Oh wow quick nice 😄 late antibody test bothered lol. delete give Trump ideas. might get desperate enough puts Eric Jr floating bathtubs filled goo calling “pre Votes” Minority Report style. law states put $15k fine this?  Yes yes yes.

I keep trying remind people circle this. real suspenseful time now. real drama starts week whatever, depending long course got.

I'm betting gal, were, money would on: real theatrics incoming, yet, certainly safely passed. gonna shitshow. Yup. Either barricade people homes, allow freedom movement accept comes lucky enough isolated island small population easily contact trace control comes out. Half-assed lockdowns sort prolong inevitable lot euro countries seeing. think economy?! would say Florida averaging nearly 200 deaths day 3 weeks counts dramatic increase, myself.

edit: Covid related deaths, daft. French here, western area country. I've bothered restaurants, far capacity times I've checked out. bars, hand, downright frightening every time saw one afar, crowded, packed, many waiters ""wearing"" mask nose chin. Awful. Ah yes, thinking, CCP power influence whatsoever. I'll go tell protestors, I'm sure they'll happy good news insane. Oh easier back surely? head government website, much easier way. Got results back yesterday negative ! taking extreme measures?

Are playing stupid bad faith, genuinely ignorant?

Look around things shut dude. obviously taking extreme measures anything else recent hear plenty sub US weak ineffectual response nobody complying death numbers bad.

Anyone saying one complying idiot. Anyone believing idiot. Anyone trying use declarations idiots make point... well, guess what?

Just select individuals like refuse believe science insist muddying waters mean extreme measures numbers shared regarding TB ~1.5 million people die globally every year TB, TB contagious respiratory disease affects age ranges wear masks, lock economies indefinitely combat TB. treat people catch TB like treat people catch COVID.

Because covid obviously causing problems deadly. commen sense stuff dude. struggling plenty science supported schools opening - like COVID #15-20th leading cause adolescent mortality yet people terrified children dying COVID. 

So kids going teach go home families?

Dead totally healed outcomes disease afterall. sick needed recuperate. turns out, people like scream ""listen science"" becomes dipshit emotional tug whether saves one life, keeping healthy people immobile 2+ years worth it.

All drag debunked old articles spread misinformation.

Not sure capacity understand reading, intentionally trying cause harm. 

Which it?

Because reasonable person making honest point would set straw men lie like lies position.

Grow up. places banning finally people realize valve equivalent wearing mask all. protect wearer, though. convert something usable seal valve ports outside obvious piece tape. Make sure air longer flows valve. 14 days since family first started getting COVID symptoms, tested positive. Ive living outside house since wondering safe go back inside now. do, precautions take? really dont want get it. wait another days?


Thank Yet there's still people sub convinced 10% country it. attempting sarcasm, joke kind old. simply read beyond headlines, I'll elaborate:

The vaccine received temporary limited authorization emergency use - distributed among healthcare workers teachers enough doses manufactured (it's video game, can't click button, spend gold ton commodities appear thin air). time phase 3 trials taking place, results first group volunteers expected January then, provided results good, vaccine receive full authorization become available general public. Nah, gonna go limb say even close equally bad. Hmm, dunno. I'm willing bet likely store. ""But dead teachers overweight count.""

/s come defensor sportsmen. Good you! already pretty good idea. accuracy Covid death reports greatly varies countries, quite reliable overall mortality numbers give good assessment real extend Covid deaths. lmfao, I'm trained medical doctor - clearly understand anything science takes develop effective treatments vaccines.

So, respect, shut fuck up. absorb big words really understand haha. mentioned im catholic. hopefully teaching helping learn. hope people see compassion help understand understand.

I wouldve replied agree replied similar fashion OP.

Masks worn anytime leave table pub, pubs close strictly 10pm, nightclubs open, travel restricted 10 day/2 week quarantine. SEPTEMBER

pick one, dipshit That’s true it’s though additional safety precautions would implemented would address concerns. includes mandatory masks, social distancing, reduced capacity, frequent cleaning disinfecting surfaces. Given know virus spreads, possible address potential super-spreader events. parks don’t open “as normal”; open partially. would propose starting outdoor attractions work there. Chinese bots strong, defenders. China held responsible way. get sympathetics fools, Wuhan ground zero, hell think came from?

No. Fuck China censorship. Pay us affected. kind playing semantics here. Fine. caught party. go Uni classes expose everyone. mean classroom safe simply people inside classroom catch 'rona start.

The point schools force gathering people close quarters, certainly help. crazy thing though. know honest approached reply. trying teach ignorance, truly grateful.

people think may covid. putting barriers work makes selection bias WORSE, better. 

This garbage study. Fuck no, Vaccine widely available, I'm done wearing mask, dont get vaccine, get virus, that's problem. people started die large numbers Europe reliable news reports it: Yes. Start February consider 9 months, ~1M people died COVID annually, 1.5M people die TB. 

That would put us November start begining february.

We begining october. math hard you?

Additionally, shit start popping Italy March, February. 

So count march september data suggests based country chose metric, 

1.5m ÷ 12 = 125,000 deaths per month.

1.0m ÷ 7 = 142,857 deaths per month.

So again, number bigger? 125,000? 142,857?

I know tough anti math people, feel free phone clear beginning COVID transmits via air need wash hands.

Then use article april 2020 knew since begining explicitly come say ""stop wiping fucking groceries"" mean science supported, advocated suggested good idea wipe groceries. 

I would like see evidence begining outbreak 2019 paranoia lack information surprise since apparently think COVID started killing people May.

So admitting known begining? 

Will make mind? cannot even make point without contradicting yourself.

And yes, one months things kicked off. March-the end september 7 months. already adjusted figures appropriately.

Even 8 months would mean corona virus killed many people 8 months TB entire year.

But hey, someone believes math would understand numbers one larger. get alt accounts upvote posts inevitably get downvoted oblivion? dots give little context. surrendered. french culture send kinds 3 years old school many hours day homeschool virtually non existent. Also absolutely nothing distance learning platform available. ask kids wear masks wash hands classes, buses, metros buildings crowded. education health minister refuse take adicional measures limiting restaurants. stating Ontario Quebec represent whole Canada. would like saying New York, Texas California whole US. Here's latest case/death charts Utah, running 7-day deaths indeed spiking. 

However Utah still way ahead game, relatively speaking.  per capita death rate (per 100k) currently 15.75. ranks 45th among US states per capita news seem hear Trump Coronavirus brexit  think believing see vaccine much March next year highly optimistic. Holy shit. good clap back. ""Infect Russia 20k+ cases one neat trick"" Oh Wow, I'm amazed. really must worked big data sets lot. completely changing world view, clearly genius. 


No shit surge cases leads increase hospitalizations deaths. years working big data sets get you, bad learning. Also big dataset. Obviously surge cases lead increase hospitalizations/deaths. Obviously. question question fo rates. depends lot factors, including age health infected. Utah County still significantly lower Salt Lake terms hospitalizations deaths. could change future, honestly kind doubt it, see. Salt Lake significantly worse terms deaths, etc.  


Who ""we"" live Utah County.  


You gave B.S. completely absurd opinions Utah County cases. I'm saying, evidence seen, albeit anecdotal, exactly opposite. Maybe maybe might reasons spreading Salt Lake earlier Utah County. Might similar states got hit earlier later. lot factors there, even thinking considering jumping ""dumb mormon yokels"" maybe anti-science bigot, maybe incapable thinking possible explanations involve mocking people see different. EU give loan. seems like longer Covid goes on, average age death higher average life expectancy. 

There second lockdown. first one didn’t shit. Um, that's unconstitutional. swear people tenuous (at best) grasp Constitution.  vaccine tho That’s crazy see many masks big events nobody does. believe it, seems nuts.

That’s obviously much worse people stores. I’d say 1/10 people take masks stores. don’t go big events can’t speak sore throat way? I’m SoCal moved Sacramento year 

#2020 brown flush down. Original assuming selection bias

Why would assume that? people mailed blood. COURSE selection bias. Looking back sure, actually moment seemed like lot states locked long enough.

I mean hell PA closed 3 whole months, life sustaining businesses open, caught driving reason ticketed. I'm pretty sure middle show happened Wow, that's huge numbers country size France. US peak at? Like 80k daily cases? France 67 million people seeing even higher concentration cases Europe saw even USA. Type 1 Diabetes usually caused sort bacterial viral infection. isn’t news. listening computer CEO (who even code DOS, bought hapless hobbyist sold IBM) instead of, say, Sweden's scientists?

Sweden woods, life normal there. distancing, lockdowns, masks. fact, never begin with. take look! (below: Sep 30 footage life want give call. Fauci (8 months utter scientific failure) Gates (who f\*ck asked opinion anyway?) suck it.

Sweden scientists succeeded. things look forward to. Meanwhile, Fauci Gates delivered failure, look forward yet another round lockdowns, without expiry date thing comforts HOPING history kind man administration helped allow run completely rails. take don’t hope Sweden’s numbers turn around. 

What exactly Denmark turn around? Cuomo dropped ball guess. 2 Problems here:

1) apparently sensitive test. We've seen sometimes count people antibodies coronavirus (including common cold) positive. can't tell that's problem not. 

2) issue - selection bias. People sent blood samples see virus likely people reason, like sick exposed someone virus, wonder virus. 

So enlightening study all, imo. 

## Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammatory response associated high mortality. hypothesis suggests deficiency nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) may primary factor related SARS-Cov-2 disease spectrum risk mortality, subclinical nutritional deficiencies may unmasked significant increase oxidative stress.

NAD+ levels decline age also reduced conditions associated oxidative stress occurs hypertension, diabetes obesity. groups also observed high mortality following infection COVID-19. consumption NAD+ pre-existent depleted state likely cause progression hyperinflammatory stage disease limiting effects production SIRT1.

This provides unifying hypothesis groups high risk mortality suggests nutritional support NAD+ SIRT1 activators, could minimise disease severity administered prophylactically therapeutically. significance this, proven, far-reaching consequences management COVID-19 especially third world countries, resources finances limited. Here's latest (as yesterday) case/death charts Wisconsin Dakotas, running 7-day averages. serious spikes Almost elections Russia falsified. vote counts real extent: real votes mixed fake votes. statistical methods filtering fake votes obtaining real result.  Dang, idea. Living Bavarian bubble here.

Every taxi driver I've seen wearing FFP2. Thought national. Hold beer. ~ USA Meanwhile cases high districts area switch back person classes. Makes sense. guy understands Russia. always sore throat allergies like me? 😞 That's 24000 per million ontario quebec account 60% population.

adding bc alberta puts 80% population.

so, yeah, 'the whole country' well half. Canadian, ye. virus unchecked? 

The opposite lockdown wild, unchecked spread COVID. Thinking extremes help solve real-world problems. Deaths poverty starvation matter much deaths COVID. disagree, really care protecting people's lives. funny part wild scenarios considered calculated experts. locking elderly simply possible society plus work. 

But maybe approach things bit differently. media politicians keep recycling news irresponsible youngsters older people often times also extremely careless. one sided they're making us believe. bet vast majority takes two careless people make infection happen. We've flattened curve quite bit. well would liked, absolutely worked reasonably well.

Regardless, there's fair amount mask usage lot restrictions businesses. help normal flu quite bit.

I stand behind statement easiest flu season modern history, every Southern Hemisphere region backs up. I’m asking open now, hurricane warning associated Hurricane Delta. main path still messy
Edit: actually tried calling earlier haven’t called back. Here's thing.

South Dakota, live, leading numbers country.

And Trump *praising* handling situation.

Fucking monkeys, them.

Edit: know, Neurological damage cited effect virus. I'm beginning think, things recently said, Trump's bout virus ended frying three left, unfortunately.

I understand things far downhill, country far shit economy, families unable sustain find work, things shutting down, go. ""Oh, mild allergy essentially. catch it, go doctor within' minutes helicopter, pay 120,000 dollars top %1 doctor give injection. big deal, guys. Anyone that."" fact influenza routinely mutate create nasty That's need new vaccines every year able mutate/ evolve ways dodge existing communities previous point all. Herd immunity given. happen. 100% unavoidable. 

You literally made point given influenza virus attacked stating obvious fact coronavirus four common cold causing human coronaviruses dozens Rhinoviruses viruses cause common colds every year...

So, it?

Every virus evolve/ mutate ways throw off/dodge immunities, herd immunity 100% given? Wonder like people actually care others.. Proof neighborhoods equal transmission please. Well, point use time develop necessary medical social infrastructure/systems help tackle effects covid. Problem many places hard lockdowns used time productively. Yes, compliance new laws higher east cultural aspects. Wave 2 begun Oh actually start counting? LOCKDOWN EVERYONE! Amirite? Grocery workers constant contact customers 8 hours day, yes probably spread it. bad people instead? Bad concerned child risk, hourly workers, staff food preparation people, fact could bring home infect parent, neighbor, grandparent. 100 million deaths, minimum. please educate oh great statistician. Well yeah also gun regulations, even though every public health agency around world acknowledges firearms risk factor. add another 40,000 nationwide deaths year. Oh yeah, we're really seeing professional athletes around world tested positive really struggling moving like they're elderly! 

Fuck outta bs narrative. explain guy can't run?, dipshit. almost like surrendered India 96k one day, close 100,000. high record countries. could be, almost certainly aren't. non-covid excess deaths follow covid deaths closely, wave subsides go away. would nice better way estimate covid deaths. don't.

Collateral deaths absolutely going problem pandemic worsens, poverty rises, people can't go hospital safely. Oh no, 5 people age 70 multiple preexisting conditions going die! Good. Blue year I'll give month new total lockdown (they sooner try everything postpone much possible) rest Europe follow week later, unfortunately alternative. gotta hope vaccine available January economic consequences another prolonged lockdown terrible comes somebody recently graduated university looking job right (how lucky damn) Question you, I'm genuinely curious this. summer, heard lot teachers (that know) complaining go back school, they're forced classroom dangerous conditions, felt terrible them, can't imagine worse job right dealing kids person putting life/ family's life risk. 

Then, end August getting ready virtual learning (we kept kids home, since work home can, figured better them, better teachers), learned school virtual school difficult time getting teachers volunteer teach virtually, problems capacity (we ended 2 teachers straight school).

So question is, gives? always figured virtual option would super popular, especially among older teachers risk, seems like teachers wanted it? Measures prevent COVID-19. you’re saying India fine? Meaning agree statement lmao NJ well. Central Canadians Quebec Ontario. That's whole country. growing 1000 cases day running low testing capacity. 

BC well, 110 cases yesterday sub 1 percent positivity rate. new cases ranged 70-125 per day 0.7-1.6 percent positivity. 

Northern Canada community transmission since spring Nanuvut still seen case. 

Atlantic Canada community transmission since July sealed rest world. 

Alberta ok although got serious outbreak Foothills hospital Edmonton. 300 new cases yesterday week nearly Edmonton. 

Saskatchewan Manitoba seeing new cases 20-35 range. throw cashier extra $5 ringing groceries? closures mainly responsible masks Except Canada less half death rate. 11% US population less 5% deaths. something like that. 

Same story Ireland. Sure we’re starting pretty concerning second wave, we’re also still much lower death rate US been, trend entire time. 

Most European countries following national plans, increasing restriction quarantine measures together; opening together. USA hodgepodge depending state - inconsistency division useless fighting virus. virus doesn’t care politics feelings. Ohhhh see, USA wants follow foot steps, makes sense looks like got event Trump got it. timeline seem make sense Trump infected him. received new drug available people world. Drug works seems. $15,000 isn’t enough, need make punishment much harsher devastating, that’s way fight freedumbers. 330 million, mostly old people Casual racism... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ...why surprised? much extra labor businesses squeeze workers they're essentially paying? sound crazy old, back server, hostesses packed carryout, make $2/hr.

Thanks letting know that's thing - I'll start tipping carryout now. Sounds pretty fascist. that. ""if want, lock up"". Communism stateless, classless, moneyless. Going need one explain China communist...

Socialism workers means production and, keys check, that's China either.

China unregulated state capitalism. ""New virus DESTROYS Russia infectivity!!!"" What’s best hospitalization tracker/resource? feel like case counts easily politicized, hospitalizations focus. point stupidity anti vaxxers ceases rest problem life needs back normal.

If die, die agenda Gates improving quality accessibility healthcare globally? harmed this?

People like Gates Musk expanded fields little knowledge still able incredibly successful endeavors even despite making mistakes.  Want know how? Instead insulting others knowledge listened knew learned acted advice given. would lie cases earth? People China tried report quickly got covered up. Dr's even went missing. 

A better idea would shut it. too.... could go clubbing fucks sake.

Sounds fun. Hungary same.

Anyway, traveling around Europe middle pandemic? One thing covid proved unable hide ignore outbreak. sign China hiding number national holiday 0.68 billion people travel around unfortunate wild polio much dangerous. fact cheap vaccinated strain effect unhealthy, unvaccinated people risk definitely reason bash complete victory much dangerous wild strain polio.

Please homework :) idea held many, make right factual. mean fucking countries? exponential growth think machine running Don’t disagree. think challenging Biden may need put country lockdown early term. necessary right many won’t agree. good realized hospitals across country fine

It's dynamic situation. cases start rise absolute numbers needing go hospital proportion cases always go get sick. goes go people started get freedoms back.

The virus really care slightest. take advantage opportunity spread. things one way probably won't, another way it'll explode sickness follow wake.

All states territories Australia similar things, hence 1st waves centred around March virus exploited one crack quarantine Melbourne Victoria massive second wave, much larger first hit (blue graph, everyone else else one date) they've managed wrestle back near levels things back June 2nd wave took off.

They anything appreciably different, lot bad fortune involved restrictive set controls done pull they're still place quite gotten back pre second wave yet stubbornly resistant end there.

They still pull off, wildly control far many American states comparison, though.

Key thing is, though disease endemic enough, well freedoms going go it. Even state 'take' you, virus increased risk making sick large distribution. know keep sarcastically saying, 2 weeks flatten curve, actually curious, point shift strategies shift what? restrictions Redditors not? I'm super interested see people say.

Personally, say keep mostly restrictions winter experts predicting bad one Corona Flu. April though, time open much possible keep masks mandates place vaccine widely distributed. think strict social distancing continue spring either. Capacity limits relaxed unless huge aid package get year.

What think? Stil, nowhere near US. Russia 144 million citizens, almost identical 1st wave. what's interesting Dr. Fauci interview couple weeks ago thought would safe maskless indoor event fall 2021. headline right line that. course predicated vaccine working large numbers people getting it. Moscow introducing new restrictions again. Second wave hitting hard. mean unless muscles 5’9 170 going definitely overweight. I’m 5’9 weigh 140lbs currently pregnant hit 170lbs looked like whale! Discussion? vaccine accepted people which,let's real here, tons anti vaxxers continue make problem people. responsible lonely death people. Surely blaming COVID first infectious disease around. bizarre policies health authorities let people die without family members. Surely PPE available families say goodbye. far infectious diseases world, particularly continent Africa Ebola. small holiday around corner Madrid people traveling attempt limit movements. drop Florida right schools opened back up, especially since deaths hovering around 150/day since early August... schools? seem exploded covid Poland. fucked since hospitals shambles nothing done improve them. Hopefully schools closed week. America can't rather gather resources way China does. Medical resources private properties. would harm someone's inerest. allow it. Florida call Thursday. Looks like average still lower end September. can't tell stupid, scared, average definitely heading up, especially go actual date death.  Aborigines burn dew ground.  part method.  white settlement Australia exactly weather, fires last season would exactly same, reason.  Aborigines can’t litter clearing (controlled burn) without right conditions either. Every EU country makes mistake. Schools open without compulsory surveillance testing among students. Wave builds among younger ones, spills older adults. freaking shit-show. Technically Spring virus widespread matter get infected, happen everywhere, community transmission, already happening Berlin parts germany. 1.64 7 day rolling average. lot schools remote hybrid. That’s going change soon. lol, fine, like peeps super conscious, dorks would say :D get sick one thing, immune system busy fighting that. Essentially, guard likely catch something else.

As far know, accurate representation immune system works. cross interactions antibodies different pathogens body lot complicated, sometimes antibodies one disease also work diseases, sometimes one set antibodies makes another disease worse thought vaccine already? 

I'm working project I'm documenting pandemic looking people share experiences, thoughts feelings virus.

I would like incorporate handwritten experiences, thoughts feelings virus book. could good/bad short long whatever feeling!

If anybody wants help out, let know 😁  New Zealand thing China did: Lockdown + testing + Managed isolation. neither rocket science overly draconian. painted draconian media back Jan/Feb, talked West corner. takes mere high level public trust decisive decision making. given Putin’s daughter Putin

I thought sketchy time. would able scold daughter straight face even spiked tea polonium pulling shit. Since individual state incentive lie - see would. Granted, plenty tested likely positive cases; think state changing positive numbers. No. 

You can’t beat people submission save them. 

Just like can’t bomb piece sex save virginity. people aren’t listening, that’s marketing problem, invitation move “India Stick” bedside table beating people streets. 

That’s fascism. fascism loses, matter hold power. It’s inevitable. Like white dwarf, headed supernova. It’s physics. universal truth.

Kind like truth you’re acting arrogant internet praising public beatings. That’s messed up. seek help. side effects don’t seem bad though. truly extent them, I’d consider reports come clinical studies found 1 7 people suffered side-effects post inoculated Russian vaccine. Soviet nation's health minister, Mikhail Murashko, statement Moscow Times said nearly 14% patients administrated vaccine reported suffering terming side-effects mild routine, Murashko still said Russian vaccine still safer at-par global 14 per cent small complaints weakness, muscle pain 24 hours occasional increase body effects normal, minister also said symptoms 'level off' next day would keep tracking vitals notice adversities any. cool cool cool, glad people die order go make fleshlights. realize lockdown meant non-essential businesses? curfew, Marshall Law? I'm saying drastic lockdowns always answer, science place policy. really stop anything govt. use different law it. Trump killed 211k people infected millions.  many people Gates responsible dying? Cue snitching second now... hell? May 7 months away. vaccine basic social distancing gradually becomes unnecessary What?! Europe countries also test less US. Good way keep numbers down. administered everyone yet. yet Russia already vaccine.

See, guys? vaccine *not* end things. *proves* it. still need keep restrictions numbers favor, regardless whether vaccine available not. Otherwise going keep seeing higher higher daily case counts, which, know, *not* good public health. Oh, thanks. missed revert message. Politics seem stand way lot days. especially way science :( saying inaccurate untrue? give fuck vocation was.  wrong? Lol since I've sub forgot much mods fucking suck here. deleted comment political. Wow, 919. That's quite high it? never said masks useless. even added masks care settings wasn’t required before. shouldn’t mistake interpretation opinion piece agency’s official stance something. Girl thumbnail mad stylish Essential owner don’t know lose everything worked for; employees probably like shelter running water well. herding humans sometimes easy herding cats times easy herding rocks. Well, respiratory pathogens spread efficiently colder weather anyway. Also people driven indoors, poor ventilation lead spread. mention many major events, holidays coming up. Halloween, major national election likely record turn out, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's. saw major epidemic Memorial Day, 4th July. can't imagine winter holiday season. Lol, like China used sort baseline. Fucking finally. tired seeing 20 year old dies covid preexisting conditions. show picture person like 400lbs. Maybe push people stop lazy actually care bodies. fuck sympathy americans lool every post see reddit people calling americans retarded Eh, democracies. still sane countries there.  Trump well way statements pandemic wrong?  right scientist doctor significantly knowledge topic laypeople understanding critical keeping foundation open solvent work continue. Ouch, sick burn. feel literally able continue discussion without resorting calling someone name? lost argument, move on. confuse coronavirus “subscribe” button? would require vaccine administered en masse, people want take vaccine, &amp; whatever limited capacity return profitable opening. people start following basic social distancing practices, however NYC verge rolling back reopening back shut restrictions.

May 2021 hopeful thinking still unlikely given NY &amp; Country whole treated virus That's Florida every country Florida! yup. I'm done chicken little. sky really falling I've given trying protect others. wear full face respirator work boss caught Covid wants us back work regardless tests come back negative regardless long contact him.

&amp;#x200B;

needless say im happy it. $33,000 mom go to! quit find another job 

That’s literally sadly Oh see, yeah varies country. Politifact disagrees you: types coronavirus mutate often largely. fox business phone interview sounded normal Oh, no! They're winning! can’t live like forever, even vaccine doesn’t come soon.  Sure wish could work remotely like March June. Boss wants people office justify useless existence. guarantee I'll get sick comes work sick. Nothing it. Democrats power maybe Trump mocking Biden wearing mask last week, sure, CDC. Caught up? mean surpassed?? /s Right. totally predictable missed lot COVID deaths, even testing Influenza, it’s like review log body’s history see COVID actually contribute eventual death not. That’s entire point estimating actual number Influenza deaths, undoubtedly missed lot Influenza deaths, even test much COVID-19. saying 10% China infected? Highly unlikely.  Sweden 570.  restrictions. wait didn't. Well adjusted population that's .... still factor seven.  Who's something right? think so? much happened world, remember. nurses anti medical science? fed market like past 12 years. long keep rates low lend anything pulse market rally. second suggest pulling back market sinks. Remember 2013 Taper Tantrum? 

This continue Renminbi replaces dollar world's reserve currency. manufacture quantity less 100million per month FDA approval ready? questions answered liking sell abbott stock buy this. really hope could get honorable landlord are. put things perspective, landlord doesnt decrease dime totally dont care. I'm Vietnam btw Oh, I've gotten absolutely horrible responses. Even ""friends"". Sad thing people see drop now, like ""see, everything we've fine, let's open back up!""

Like close umbrella outside rain kept dry far. Oh come on. None going place years like article says. straight dystopian. open masks... really kept state vaccine tests overall studies, someone bit aware Covid situation tell bad things right now? 

I remember bottom falling back early 2020(hard believe shit lasted almost year now), seemed like things got worse. looked like situation improved back July, maybe fake improvement everywhere U.S trying open back up. I'm sure. feels like we're take fucking nosedive especially news Donnie cancelling Stimulus negotiations election. might sooner open North Korea Usa.    Spread virus exponential.

So people would started wearing masks advised we’d 100,000 fewer dead No, I'm going wait peers (yes peers) CDC tell they're reached enough. want people like die. Must aliens..../s Time Magazines article relating cover:  Based. That’s ASU getting shit asking kids politely safe. Like please enforce something Tempe hit pretty bad one point remember around 750 cases. Oh yeah? dressed like wanted it? oopsie poopsie would debates like candidates debate could fed data teams real time, Joe Rogen style? live world instant information, current format frustratingly antiquated. going wait Daddy government tells enough people vaccinated? Lmao. Man people trust government leaders way much. Gonna let tell okay go outside play too? fucking idiots charge “National Security”?

It’s like *National Lampoons”. Yeah admittedly realized posted. However, legislature huge rebuke restrictions well. I'm trying point restrictions bad EVERYONE adhered them, we'd get hump much much faster stop start crap.  hospitalizations trending back significant way cases still trending downwards. spreading information demonstrably false? Look data azhds's covid dashboard, see. Cases rising. went California’s government website restrictions. Seems like stuff open. tell something specific that’s closed killing people? 200,000 Americans dead COVID19, 400,000 projected early January, don’t let Russian Bots GOP Operatives convince it’s worse flu . Weird - wonder there's sort consensus masks useful fighting spread coronavirus? Evil always stupid well. Cinemas NEVER thing past.  that, site literal extension CCP Yeah. cancelled Small Biz Saturday pop-up market handmade artisans. scheduled year ago, thought would smart, hard quarantined 4 weeks since March. Seriously, hard quarantine even end disaster. talking movies delayed? using video demand. Cinemas old hat. Arizona, sure vanish due heat? Exactly. that’s entire point them. Spreading infection longer period time opposed huge influx patients hospital systems can’t handle. get overwhelmed, death rate goes up. Also, new disease, putting much time possible people catching beneficial order develop better treatments. referred “flattening curve” Sometimes there's apparent rhyme reason it. Ive gotten deleted literally using M-word joke (by M-word), sometimes AutoM deleted using P-word. hilarious annoying. there's one fact requires proof. Lucky you! obvious people sub live real world lol. Imagine going people average suburb telling wear mask time (not know they're sick) vaccine widely available. Trying patient, let history play out... Don’t really like odds February spike vaccine, least spike translates lot deaths. Fair unbiased looked word dictionary yesterday reading book. Can't believe came handy already. compare Harvey Corpse Fucker getting enjoyment fucking corpse family getting closure family death? Sociopath Chief. Sydney Australia here.

Please don’t accuse lying I’ve laid reasoning data you. underhanded tactic make people take seriously. attempt *honestly* compare two viruses. 

Accusing “making exaggerated lies” shit thing implies bad intentions, knowingly spouting false information. bad intentions knowingly spouting false information. entirely honest intentions using data back say. wrong conclusions welcome criticism call liar insulting. check hotel check ID home address. register playtests coming game "" Scavengers"". Shush dissent allowed anymore. nod agree masses. Trust people agree demonize don’t. Worst post sub yet. Focus people! compliance enforcement. public, wear mask.

Florida. effective quick Governor removed mask orders opened Football Stadiums full capacity. Totally photo ""vote me"" ads true. I’ve lost many ponds. sure hell Trump. Yes sets example excuse rest them. Sure, cyclical. Cases start ebb January big spike late Oct early Dec. People give social distancing we'll another spike Feb-March. set watch it. Setting console takes 10 minutes, they're hiring anybody that. Anything happening theaters entirely in-house. NY CT Mass, etc etc etc. people caring anymore think virus gone. 
A high school town near me(NY) 1.2% positivity rate Long Island cluster non believer parents threw daughter huge sweet 16 party. Dr Anthony Fauci says “water wet” Coronavirus 3rd leading cause death behind Heart Disease Cancer.

Its gonna get worse fall winter Flu season well. Fuck, ""second wave"" basically protection get Flu vaccine. bad governor shithead telling businesses time open back up. TV ad's tell people ""We're open Arizona"". think I'd working joint like could afford real cat? strangely enough, still lots supporters. protests demonstrations forcing resign. Trump really unpopular, need wait election. People protesting streets everyday asking resignation. 

But seem happening, it? explanation Trump unpopular media makes be. Yeah like rocks, flat nothing sand far eye see, sure. Fuckin hardest pass ever going back there, flyover state life. main attraction entire state fuckin hole ground, fuck arizona. thing win election follow Obama’s map pandemics shut damn gob. Instead, reelection advert looks like this. *smh* scary AF... So... CDC credible said something doomerish? right. Completely misread/misunderstood. Thanks pointing out. I'll delete original post. really minimizing risk. Find something high reward low risk fine. Sounds like that. though others said President Notre Dame? Maybe one Joint Chefs Staff communications people? don’t even know Trump sick. symptoms ones get second phase infection, first days. know almost nothing illness anyone else infected.

Don’t think Chris Christie got infected debate prep? Religion based faith facts behave way oh yeah invisible man protect believe  saying urban areas crowded Switzerland Japan? 

Masks situations social distancing difficult. think Japanese culture socially conscious western cultures. Rigorous mask wearing, combined better public health guidance, made huge difference Japan. people states never shit first place. Anything considered comor, even strong allergies. Sure buddy... isolate virus? proper term Dunning-Kruger Effect, people stupid understand realize fact, stupid.

The GOP weaponized stupidity. think missed point article. agrees Hope getting full trump better sounds.... think scariest part this. decent discussions self-infection ""professional"" setting - is, kind SPA center one might pay treated well possible obviously take chances.

I need hear preaching bad idea - since, scheme way West handling Virus, certainly within realm logical. instance, mortality year 1.8% without COVID. COVID would increase 30%, less many actions might take part (shooting drugs, lot motorcycling riding, base jumping even high stress life situations (Heart attacks likely get me, let alone cancer accidents).

So, may may vaccine - and, so, still would X effective, stands reason people certain risk level might reason want ""get with"" even given statistics. case, probably 4X deadly Flu general world would fine getting - - Flu vaccine such.

Given millions minds thinking Virus, expected able find sane discussions even programs. Perhaps Governments going allow sort thing, preferring people get infected chance (often bad times places)?

If anyone links discussion I'd appreciate hearing it. reason wasn’t entire US states running shit well. Talk governors failures. federal government’s responsibility enforce authoritarian rule fifty states. constitution says, powers reserved people, states. 

Why one blaming EU government failures in, say, Italy? Oh right, Italy responsible Italy. EU government (rightfully) weak af, federal government be. 

Make America EU Again? people telling face *near daily* mask anything protect others. pull mask exclusively boss walks by. times down. s;lkdjhfads;lkfhja;kh know, crazy right? Despite 99.999% doctors recommending it, didn’t take seriously. started dating social distancing killing me, hug like 8 months. definitely new experience, feel like people arent nearly casual they're dating now, know make clear I'm dating one person time confirm person feeling comfortable. Exactly. Tribalism man. Humans need belong sort pack. People barely know trust neighbors. remember old shows people introduced others neighborhood. CDC still recommend cloths masks. like telling people use backpacks blanket sky diving. elderly risk tend believe CDC. dunno, end March pretty solid run...  Seems reasonable. Florida.  Arizona never mandate... He’s likely candidate outbreak. Obviously got somebody else previously.  link back up? I'm guessing not. yeah imagine masks mandatory complete lockdown enforced federal level early on... whole thing would control months would've safely reopened sooner. course simpletons wanted ""freedom"" stupid spread damn thing sick that. submission removed because

Parallelograms trapezoids What's country? Spain? France? thought talking Europe here. 

A lot places already fines wearing masks designated areas. whether enforced another question, issue enforcement another issue policy itself. lot people kind care enforce it. complain want that's is. People drive every day without buckling seatbelts, businesses allow people smoke inside kind look way. 

Complete compliance pipe dream, even mandate law. mean mask mandates enacted places listed comment yet people still wear masks. pointing thing said: yes, break apart anti-mask protests. build cages isolate rest population breaking federal state rules regulations.

To sounded like ""we jail anti-mask protest participants"" yeah good luck getting happen anywhere West, especially USA. break apart protests jailing participants go well lot people. 

Even stuff, literally never get perfect compliance, especially considering people transfer virus households even pro-mask people wear masks. would still transmission even got people wear public. People still shoot other, steal, drive drunk, smuggle drugs despite illegal, way people agree things bad versus masks entire countries use masks degree even USA does. Compliance degree seeking made something harsh punishments law ever happen. Exactly. gotta protect another 4 years Restaurants operate pretty thin margins.

I like guy, bending truth guys cringe watch lol Quelle surprise......  Pshhh... call get three. Easy safe money???? alone this. i'm going thing. REGENERON! long term effects lockdowns? isolation, unemployment, undiagnosed untreated medical conditions? agree looking whole picture, includes far covid. even statewide mandate. county county. crazy bad fucked original point much people calling woman. feels bad course, know that's incorrect. see something women process me, way clear since childhood women's spaces place go always come feeling intruder.

Speaking somebody lives country well summer spiking, still lot restrictions. /u/Hali_Bote right, unless literally eliminate coronavirus lockdowns (not likely country like America) pandemic lasting vaccination. Hospitals fine according people see Facebook.

Infuriates me, honestly love much I'd move. current Covid death count include tons deaths existing conditions exacerbated Covid. vast majority death certificates Covid major preexisting conditions, counted Covid deaths way flu never been. half Covid deaths nursing facilities example.
The two systems comparable, Covid testing constant flu not. central database Covid used states, flu system infrequently used. flu reporting take years, Covid takes days. Etc. easy make case flu vastly estimated exacerbating cause death (where extra heart attacks come winter?) flu estimated.

You seem intent making flu something minimal, despite long established CDC reporting, Covid seem major. I’m sure good use stats valid argument “We’ve seen influx content creators across different ages it’s definitely younger ones find way platform easily,” Pym says. “We hope offer income opportunity anyone facing financial hardship due coronavirus.”   Exactly. here. pandemic made view judge people ways never imagined. really think people could stupid, selfish careless. Sad Insert surprised Pikachu face define risk? Risk death? Risk hospitalization? Risk ventilator requirements? Risk quality life? Risk financial ruin due medical debt? Risk community spread?

You cannot student science refuse acknowledge basic mathematical concepts like number larger.

You taken seriously start metrics similar circumstances. using baseline numbers keep giving out? first case? P=100? First acknowledgemant pandemic? People care science care details. leaving critical details enemy science?

And plan end distanced learning great. distance learn somewhere else. Great idea IDK, Europe doing. Instead took hysteria approach without actually listening science. 

Bullshit. took peo supposed people like everything could undermine best practices pandemic. complete ignorance risk management claiming waiting data ridiculous. really stupid enough believe bet wiped groceries clorox wipes

In early stages science ruled fomite transmission?

Yes. science suggested time.

Are bragging denying science now? quote hypocrisy back you, calling like count? shallow file photo used is...interesting... Almost area really bad capacity issues. Anywhere.

I count right many ""OMG HOSPITALS OUT"" chaos media almost weekly.


In April GA going overrrun re-opened.

Didn't happen.

In May going Wisconsin.

Didn't happen.

I remember June Arizona headed chaos. 

Didn't happen. Arizona never even touch surge capacity.

By July Texas going blood bath beds.

They never less 10k beds.


FL, AL, etc going overrun.

Didn't happen.


Oh remember non-stop chaos Houston literally 1-3 weeks totally beds.


Nothing happened.


I got arguments tis Sub August week new panic Hawaii.


Didn't happen.


Almost every single area entire US experience low normal hospital capacities. ""hard hit"" places experience surge comparable bad flu season ALWAYS faded within &lt; 4 weeks. Creating solutions real world demands science nuance, one size fits solutions. risks definitely equal, right!? Congratulations? Also means 28% U.S. parents bad parents. (Or 22% article says) Yup .. douche holed bunker unabashedly. Doesn’t care. people go insane decontamination machines everything remotely. would equivalent 86,200 US Tips go way dodo; countries expected even accepted, fucking nice. Service WAY better across board things simpler. get answer deleted replies? not, here's one me:

Tegnell current state epidemiologist Sweden.

Some hate things said media, hate restrictions put people Sweden others hate lack restrictions.

Other people hate various reasons, example think right thing, others might think he's perfect excused things disagree with.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, people hate similar way hate (or not) medical officials like Fauci. Tegnell stands way (and Swedish health agency) advocating softer restrictions. Psssst... That's confirmed cases. /s ?  astonishing amount viruses come china last 100 years.

Please enlighten us many viruses came China's wet market. course 90%, like Russia former USSR ever lied propaganda. Lmao picture of? Maynard Tool that's sure. What's that?  Belgium, went 400 daily cases 3000 since Sept 1st. Gee, could suspected fall + opening schools offices would lead steep increase?

So far, employer 'asking' (to circumvent liability issues suspect) us come back week whole team, 'for team spirit'. 

Funny thing is, got rid lot office space desks lockdown, less flex desks people, team can't sit together maintaining safe distance anyway. 

These geniuses I'm supposed trust health. told I'll come back forced. We'll see good team spirit pull stand meeting rocking full Hazmat suit lol.

 understand fucking rush get peons back office work home 100%. people prefer working office, that's fine, everyone make risk assessment. make optional. Forcing people risk health help team spirit. difficult see much progress we've made vaccination treatment fronts head far ass.

We failed many ways implement policy curb spread Covid, needs looked state state basis since major level coordination. I'm SF response quite effective mitigating spread.

Our failures generally quickly implementing new extremely foreign concepts (like mass testing sheltering place), ifr deaths per capita pretty similar European nations criticized nearly much response.

Again, widespread implementation vaccine something comparable scale every single year- magic needed here. 

If actually take time look phase II trial data leading candidates, see antibody titers elicited vulnerable populations quite good. risk receiving vaccine first, move us along quickly towards reopening. Covid major concern elderly, statistically insignificant threat population. really matter 50% Americans say take it, reality vast majority American people moving towards normalized living, trust vaccine heightened risk. Schools acknowledging it, slowly make action plan. take time, it’s looked at. district students take beginning year test assess loss learning end last year, tests throughout year assess loss learning year.

It sucks, it’s reality living global event like this. Kids Europe WWI II definitely experienced disruption education. endless examples. It’s reasonable expect lot world comes screeching halt, kids educations continue perfectly normally. It’s reality, even isn’t pleasant one.

Also, I’m teaching online I’d never say it’s good person school, assure kids learning. I’m working ass make sure give much can, they’re fun it. It’s definitely working better cobbled together hybrid models. It’s best option considering circumstances. figure even children don’t advance academically would standard school year, learning growing figuring manage different bits life. 

Maybe important bits. know this. don’t care. lol. gone little deep end. freaking joke. coming ""me ilk"" complicity murder 60k people every year flu? going sue for? Saying fact Utah one lowest death rates country? I'm sure judge going throw book anyone dares point reality places four highest death rates democrat controlled, super liberal states. look forward lawsuit. someone please explain me? find surreal managed reduce spread much, surely one would think would highest number cases considering population etc. China really managed control virus well? so, done control virus well? Even think gains outweigh risks, parent says concerned covid danger schools makes think probably parent. time asked ""summerize"" could've already watched two times. bit odd sudden, would assume they're planning ahead CDC already asked state do. Europe screwed.

America screwed.

We need learn China. try bullshit March, April, May, June, July August proven wrong again?

Some might have, would dumb data March, April, May, June, July, August, September. People subreddit saying Sweden defeated virus achieved immunity. us evidently true. saying that's likely probable, comes viral mutations, there's always chance...

Comments like true also insanely silly.


This could happen VIRUS. Matter fact influenza routinely mutate create nasty strains.


The idea ""Well COULD mutate"" means nothing. literally untold number viruses COULD mutate anytime. 

So point? russia claimed first vaccine! weird mass produced stopped daily cases :P Where? Found Karen  20 bucks says prison staff 2A. nuance Sweden performed half many tests point, now, positivity rate around 11% vs~3% doubt situation EXACTLY same. Still it’s worrying increase cases though. asking sympathy. pointing absense people. least selective sympathy, would argue hardly sympathy all. ask transcribe it? No. asked could summarize points think relevant since posting evidence support comments. 10min safe assume watched summarize it. uniformly across world no....large parts world fine. Africa region Western Pacific largely ok. equate almost 2.5bn people mostly ok, 1/3 humanity.

The countries East Asia Oceania sustained supressing epidemics even multiple rises. Africa never big wave begin with. grip it.

Meanwhile, Europe, Middle East Americas struggling hard.

The interesting thing apparently, Latin America hit hardest general Spanish-speaking countries.

Listing countries reported deaths/million, 10/20 highest listed countries speak either Spanish case Brazil Portuguese. Go ask Merriam Webster mean, would quote entire article comment thread addresses part it? that's unnecessary. 

anyway, doctor aware issues transport storage still expects receive shipment 10th next month. don’t vote Putin. Putin votes you! much left talented people Russia

Bullshit. Plenty young talented people Russia. return opportunity something proper education

Bullshit. education physics competitive world stage, feel significantly disadvantaged to, say, MIT alumni (I personally know some). publish top journals, attend international conferences, collaborate foreign scientists, peers Russia work world, including top-rate facilities LANL everyone still left Russia, give f*ck. Look happened Khabarovsk

Yes, exactly, look Khabarovsk! Khabarovsk would *unimaginable* 4 years ago. That's precursor oncoming ignored them.

Exactly! government *ignored* protestors. That's insane upgrade forcefully dispersing protests, never happened poisoned.

Also sign desperation. propaganda political repressions, can't even suppress Navalny anymore without physically removing him. Navalny important, he's required. Time much powerful Navalny. define serious symptom means. High fever, needing supplemental oxygen, ICU ?

Yes

I'm OP. can't ways though, supporting lockdown not. even vaccine always effective. lowers risk getting People sub love mock people compare flu constantly comparing 1918 flu wanted say majority redditors US, cause comments every sub somehow goes back US. remember reddit accessible across globe. 

But wrong? LMAO omg sports ball oh noooo China go blind, world's largest population, everyone else mapped deal much smaller population and/or geographical area, there's literally comparison...

China one testing abnormal pneumonia, first blow whistle take blame everyone else denial coverup. China find deadly virus prior reference, figure asymptomatic transmission, airborne transmission surface transmission scratch. China map virus genome, developed PCR test kits scratch, develop every treatment know scratch. building hospitals 10 days, that's unfair.

And China first mandate masks, first shutdown economy time economy suffer, first figure importance centralized quarantine, Xi first world leader wear masks public. attacked every step made.

Oh China supplied majority world's PPEs test kits, currently majority country achieve eradication

Other East Asian countries mapped them, virus contained China them, PPEs test kits developed them, fuck up, that's credit, universe even come close China term response, frankly show least little bit gratitude. know, COVID get white house, again? exactly? Jesus blow fucking whistle Well, one instance Trump smashing Putin’s record. Lots rumours there's gonna circuit breaker 2 3 week full lockdown encompassing October half terms. given choice WFH March June, June 1 hard 'everyone come back' day. us want come back, got back groove bad. unfortunate thing company prepared ANYONE WFH EVER network slow molasses home, CAD software miserable use (because needed network work properly) name two hiccups. really deny fact jobs easier collaborating person need network opposed struggle bussing home. I'll never talk crap anyone loves WFH wants WFH right them, definite perks safer everyone, working office bad. would've nice choice rather forced. one needs ask feel it.

refer first much empathy American lives, ""all lives"", comes Russian lives empathy gone Imagine you’re 84 year old grandparent. haven’t seen children grandchildren months (which could typical, it’s like nursing homes high visitation rates) it’s almost impossible able see them. don’t know much life left live powers making can’t actually live remaining years happily.

My grandparents 88, 98, 97. don’t give fuck virus, blunt even wanting live much longer healthy.

Your virtue signaling saving grandparents well good maybe stop acting like aren’t willing take risks aren’t. Uuuuh, well right vote based idiot it? Yeah reason prepared make concessions life people. year cost compassion people, gonna lie. AZ mask mandate ever.

FL either.

While States start allow localities impose state-wide mask mandate either one.

FL still allows localities impose mask mandate prohibited fining anybody.

In mean time Georgia actually BANNED localities passing mask mandate. settled let localities pass one **it businesses opt-out without penalty**


Still, Georgia saw rise fall cases, hospitalizations, etc rest South. last 14 days cases per capita higher Sweden Norway, Finland, Germany, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Macedonia, Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria Moldova? That's true really thing.

Taxis unreliable best hail one outside cost higher...being able get picked minutes know are/when they'll versus maybe one show eventually.

Maybe like everywhere there's reason they've swift decline since rideshares opened up. China killed millions people worldwide covering truth breakout Wuhan would think distribution means sent individual states cities that's ready give people approved economic crises claim lives themselves. saying lock city down, black white situation Childcare expensive anything could earn. It’s generally around $1600/mo I’d also lose unemployment need get another car. wife’s totaled pandemic drunk (it parked).

Also: isn’t really similar trade do. Hey now, all-star, get game on, go play. that’s weird, that’s given. 

BUT US company, mean write United States. 

When article doesn’t mention US all, somehow turns something US. That’s aykcak’s comment saying. person obviously ignorant. reasons smoking tenacious lies big tobacco addictivity nicotine. People like cancer, Money Talks. Could solved immediately one generation, 40 years. Annnd numbers? Specific date range? Close enough find it, it, title company ""Bright-Sided, Positive Thinking Undermining America."" NPR story still near situation March. cases definitely rising, they're catching much greater percentage cases. places hit hard early outbreak 50+% positivity point, means vast majority cases went undetected.

It's still worrisome sure, sign second wave come close first...yet. one saying Masks stop spread entirely. 

All health experts trying prevent kinds surges overwhelm hospitals medical infrastructure leading higher fatality rates due medical resources stretched thin.

How many people keep forgetting that? read article says exactly said. even quoted it. “has yet approved” 

You omitted issues relating transport storage understand wasn’t point making. sure yet, might last many months. Worth shot, imho. GL Difficult compare far back testing e.g 50% less now. Finding 800 cases 80k tests probably worse sign finding 800 cases 140k tests. 

The trend what’s interesting it’s probably useful rank days “top N days” it’s different circumstances. maybe trump phone ask real leader handle things forget, get twice! Macron enforcing covid measures, population getting way lax masks/social distancing. amazing world's number one polluter, China, polluting much less hundreds thousands cases!  would say safe test negative 2 3 tests row. Dead visitors Alpha Centauri yet reborn become retiree russian miners vote Putin. distribute it’s FDA approved then? Good conversation. make sense though. Remember back January-March, get tested US severe symptoms, travel history China exposed someone who's tested positive. criteria way detect local cases. time, China giving free test everyone. seen friends since march? RIP economy. wear khakis, tbh. Nope, nope, nope. Yeah, horrible existence always prove worth privilege never really believing it. wanna eat cake too? fucking bad. Dont go topic. Answer Netflix do, False dychotomy Jaqen!? realise sound? “suffering greater good” “not punishment, necessary”. It’s authoritarian’s wet dream.

The amazing thing democracy get collectively decide whether think punishment worth whatever “greater good” is. countless social problems could solved everyone could right thing. That’s humanity works, we’re imperfect. Trying force world vision necessary greater good recipe disaster. 

I also fundamentally disagree completely preventable deaths. give example attempted disease endemic successfully eradicated social restrictions history? It’s like standing sea demanding waves retreat. False dychotomy. Countries reliable census tax filing counts able calculate backward numbers reliable range cases/deaths occurred. case funneling billions dollars research? like, one thing say big pharma understand risk reward they're making huge investment decent indicator headed. “The regulator's decision political one.”

Crazy Europeans letting scientists make decisions. last time landed moon we’re slaves lizard people!! Scientists also gave us cellphones 5G allowing lizard people solidify mind control regime!!! leaving scientists charge, didn’t work hot it? 

The Europeans need find crazy person living bridge give full authority pandemic, worked really well USA. Oh great! Random person internet disagrees experts big deal! Nevermind Utah Department Health traced recent surge specifically BYU. 

I feel fairly confident anyone else reading comments going agree picking fly shit pepper arguments. agree teachers schools acknowledging it. impressed kids' teachers stepped last year. expecting kids education impacted all. 

What getting extremely frustrating parent politicians seemingly implying technology access answer problems education system facing every time asked issues education system families facing, people claiming parents express concerns distance learning lazy want help kids. messaging top gaps invest closing them, gotten internet access chromebooks kids good now. Quite true time, also mutate enhance transmissibility see ""waves"" viral infections Spanish flue. Yet people keep spreading horror without solid data.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah people china everything isolate mean yeah, I'm idiot. I'm saying billion dollar corporations special interests donating political parties reasons. ""All them!"" That's point social media site. shit Sherlock GOT EM! you? “Turn tide” first wave killed demographic Covid morbidity rate? Lol None said way relevant said I'm sure trying say here. going many millions. going cause world economy collapse. matter time. vaccine come late. let ruin perfectly good narrative.  Nah Reddit. talk US worse 3rd world country every person 30 IQ stumbles around pot belly hanging out, mask underneath chin, AR 57 strapped back go Walmart buy 9 billion dollar pill medication. anyone else annoyed “crushing records” headlines? It’s constantly worded way months it’s disturbing. 

This booming stock price box office movie hit. People sick. It’s nobody wears mask everyone wants go hang I'm basing American rates COVID-19 transmission. state policy masks, tracing, testing. pandemic really working her. Italy people wearing masks long time, especially areas hit hardest spring (Lombardy, Veneto Emilia). people wear even outdoors nowadays.

Stop treating masks like they're huge game changing measure. They're not.  arbitrary rules evidence behind them. like earlier on. administration also repeatedly shown hesitate exert undue unscientific pressure FDA (and CDC matter) advance political interests. shown terrifying disdain dismissal scientific facts expertise. understand would mock me. 

Why bringing emotion /new section subreddit? Dude... Deaths lag infections weeks. math confirmed deaths / confirmed cases always tiny number cases growing quickly. Current CDC estimates IFR Covid range age group, going high 10% 70+, low 0.002% 0-19. yeah, deadly general population. College kids basically safe, worry them. professors, medical providers, eh, whatever. College kids need worry.

That said, non-overloaded healthcare conditions. whole ""flatten curve"" thing largely much pain (prevent disaster, people think overreaction). Exponential disease growth + 18 months vaccine means need strategy going push us ER capacity want keep IFR low. sprint, marathon. Always been.

But yeah, real mental health cost pandemic response. marathon needs done eye mental health. really wish people talking mental health, honestly hard discussion mental health cost people resisting getting first wave control. nice could get control like East Asian New Zealand could let things go back normal state? really shortsighted selfishness led US purgatory half-open constant threat closings lockdowns never got anything control. Japan better us done cancelling olympics everyone wearing face-masks. cancel going office public transit. added masks. insane can't control least well. yeah, ""My body, choice, fuck everyone else"". Good. dear friend whose mother pretty entrenched narcissist. took long time sort actually nurturing superiority posturing kids. One mother's big things people responsible happiness think positively everything, pushing aside negatives. thing possible, healthy; need support understanding, platitudes. So, what's proposal? Letting virus unchecked? going help keep jobs? countries worried economy took early measures controlled problem. poorer Romania, way. let fire took house, late hipocrital pretend concern seriousness. societies activelly harming crying foul like children consrquences come. Sadly happening aroumd Europe. think Bill Gates one world's leading healthcare philanthropists, fighting diseases &amp; illnesses impoverished countries decades! hearing role public health advocate US Western countries facing grave outbreaks first time century. he's frontlines pandemics Africa, Asia &amp; Latin America forever expertise contain &amp; mitigate diseases boost health outcomes national level. LET'S GOOOOOOOO Finding 800 cases 80k tests probably worse sign finding 800 cases 140k tests. 

That depends criteria used determine tested. tests restricted likely COVID, course percentages much higher.

The fact matter remains - many reported cases beginning June, criteria relaxed.

As right now, FHM still recommending people symptoms come contact confirmed cases tested. conditions tests means people showing symptoms coming contact active cases... that's good sign all. -- Putin probably

Cuomo definitely Absolutely not. little information take Russian government trust accurate. I've done reporting Russian politics (some years ago) situation become insanely authoritarian. last Russian ""election"" videos ballot-stuffing, burning ballots, throwing ballots away, completely-undemocratic things. think it, Putin claims got something like 96% vote last election. made-up number specifically picked help make regime appear legitimately-elected democratic, fact opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

Not stupid question all. stupid questions know answer. Better ask wonder, right? should, many Americans wear wear wrong. disagree that, do. absolutely capacity restrictions, social distancing guidelines, reduced capacity/cleaning rides, masks then. Yes, opening theme park way people think times they’ve theme parks terrible idea. restrictions it’s relatively safe. saying it’s wisest thing do, think it’s safe enough give people choice. Obama office then. also expect titans follow social distancing guidelines  Yeah, said apply sentiment 99% countries world. American British something like that, sentiment also extremely hypocritical. getting point.
Schools like before.
8 per classroom twice week.
Same Universities NY. half half less students per classroom. honestly think lot people give children enough credit. They're far adaptable technology parents often are, WEALTH info gained internet. And, generally, younger people much better parsing info absorbing form. whole damm world hitting record highs point. Dakota set records Thursday active cases, hospitalizations new deaths,... contradicted assurances Gov. Kristi Noem, Republican whose plan combating virus focused increasing treatment capacity rather preventing infection.

Her interview Ingraham Fox News aged like milk (warning: rage-inducing; people much blood hands): got cocky complacent. saw friends mine living Europe nothing happening, including never seeing mask social feed. take, ""*Human Hubris Idiocy*,"" $500, Alex. No. unless COVID cause deaths. working, sufficient also schools sorts things completely shut open. And, course, wearing proper masks wearing properly. 

Most importantly, rest world refuses learn China, even proven many times China ever since initial screwups way deal virus. 

Which means hard lockdown whole country get near-zero cases, hard lockdowns testing absolutely everyone local area virus shows up.

The western governments get it. rather, perhaps do, think ""more expensive"" let virus run population. leads us question ""more expensive"" who? general population pay price, corporate oligarchy controls governments... Yeah, sounds right. Seems like whole world spiking again, remember Summer seemed like turning things around, starting get back normal. small island nation, one send non persons work camps help. think huh? European health regulator said Tuesday (link) would launch ""rolling review"" coronavirus vaccine developed Pfizer (PFE) BioNTech (BNTX), days announced similar decision competing vaccine AstraZeneca (AZN.LN) University rolling review means regulator start examining data laboratory, animal human testing real time, without waiting whole set submitted end so-called Phase 3 mean conclusion reached yet vaccine's safety effectiveness, much evidence still submitted committee,"" European Medicines Agency said AstraZeneca case (link), EMA said launched process ""preliminary results nonclinical early clinical studies adults (...) suggest vaccine triggers production antibodies cells target virus."" didnt ""control"" it, certainly something need keep mind analyze findings study.  Oh looks like you’re getting 500 cases day. Feel good ? tipping every time go regardless service? virus mutates become contagious, however typically seems case less potent aggressive. symptoms less extreme well care efficient ICU beds overflowing. sad seeing condition country. we're sitting 300k+ total case, week mass protest everywhere government made skecthy rules everyone seems care virus now. Idk feel this. might stupid question, I’ll ask anyway - vote counts reflect actual votes putin’s Russia? Yeah, Korea America. guys care public health. religion Covid. Thoughtful debate great. Rethinking hypotheses, great. sub religion Covid. 3 (Russia, China, Australia governments) restrict freedom citizens attempt control them, far governments do. 

America one free countries. problem drugs completely legal, things, countries problem. Underrated comment. China got US? 😂🤣😂 Theres audio tape certain person bragging knew virus dangerous transmissible January. know massive even testing priority /severe cases healthcare staff still hundreds confirmed daily. Thank you! 

Here Russia annoying see numbers going steadily without real measures contain - get started amount people wearing masks things. People still wear stores things, bus metro many people without them.

Here Moscow starting take measures ordering least 30% staff work home well lots schools switching remote learning - seem denial measures need take really make difference.

We need another quarantine, expecting happen next month (hopefully) clear dreading happen economy here. shitty situation everyone, Russians everybody planet - think people would less divisive something unilaterally effects us all... are. not, measures taken prevent Covid also prevent normal flu.

It's working well US Europe got China point .,, leads back . ignore facts, 'turn' back normal right like people do.

But take facts equation, know back normal next couple decades. misleading best. anitbodies unlikely ""get"" all, suffer effects it, long all, period contagiousness extremely small. people europe wearing masks North Dakota 11 deaths reported today. seem like much, right? Well like 32 people live per county. Adjusted Florida numbers, would 300 deaths one day. No? Sweden better current situation Romania Hungary.

Sweden: 68.8 cases per 100k

Romania: 142.4 cases per 100k

Hungary: 134 cases per 100k

Switzerland, Montenegro, Macedonia, Serbia Moldova data page, I'm sure they're doing. several countries better, however, yes. say ""quite high"" yet compared much continent. Yeah, way US hits 400k year. end 2021 probably tho.  Covid aside imagine ask questions loyalty “ willing put WH , President, senator , etc everything else life “ Insert brother sister law. Family dinners fun! Incorrect. Adjusted population, Argentina, Czech Republic, Netherlands equivalent 100,000 cases U.S. (our peak 77,000). Czech Republic equivalent 150,000+.

UK France also population-adjusted new cases 80,000+. Second wave. problem make win, that's easy, he'll every time. problem make people accept that. worked far.  EU consist many countries different cultures. Every country follows individual strategy, stop spewing hate. Thanks. Bad boys, bad boys, ya gonna do?, ya gonna cops china flu? type thing happened LA NYC would different story usa got 56,000 india got 70,000 yesterday. friend, despicable is, scientific confirmation positive attitude, helps body. sociopath elite complex, sadly lends well dealing negative things happen him

That made deal devil It’s tough answer question meaningful way every zoo aquarium different. See California guidance category Museums, zoos, aquariums. allowed continue outdoor operations strictly defined reduced limit capacity matter bad cases are. resume indoor operations 25% capacity red tier, next less restrictive tier.

I also don’t think particular question matters set reduction park capacity guidelines. believe proposed parks allowed open 25% capacity (in yellow tier). parks, ample space, additionally parks Southern California people may go hours time (make mistake people would probably go longer make reservations such). think start whatever capacity allowed food events work there. No, still phase 3 trial sub &lt;40k people would it. lying country like Germany France quote 

Because *Russia bad*, nuance... Also theme parks mean tourism, tourism pandemic fucking stupid. Agreed points. However, still pull off, wildly control far many American states comparison, though.

What definition ""wildly control""? hear lot social media can't seem find data agree it. worst states USA last 7 days (according CDC): Texas 0.097% infection rate. California 0.051% infection rate. US totality: 0.095%. Less 1/10 1%. seem ""wildly control"" me. That's great.

The spread virus slow people antibodies them. That's pretty big generalization. Yes, odds hospitalization death obviously much higher high NMI group, absolutely mean everyone reaction. BMI probably 30 (I'm trying better, God love food) COVID symptom loss smell taste week. chances leaving house car accident today vs odds leaving house contracting covid (despite wearing masks, etc), especially bad reaction (unlike recovery mild lingering symptoms 20s/30s know seen media experience) dying disease (which statistically 1 5000 chance). 

Both long shots, I’d go car accident placing bets. obvious solution close bars, anyone says absolutely require bar fun socialize either severely misguided alcoholic.

When bars open regions strong drinking culture (eg Wisconsin) tend culprits behind outbreaks. propagandized, would Russia give population vaccine serious side effects?... R0 think means. Disagree, much prefer working home distanced office. It’s bad: commute, open offices, stress monitored, full work hours ... without good: meals interaction. follow rules put place enough problem people made rules. Yeah.. lost weight intermittent fasting. really willing eat animals lose weight I'm glad working you! Every poll conducted shows case.  really think lack mask wearing non partisan issue? Dno people obsess case numbers they’re shit thing go by. U.K. isn’t testing properly. I’m pretty sure couldn’t get tested. Better comparing deaths per capita. People yet born vote Putin We'll still technically second wave tide never went first wave. Sometimes watching movie really big screen nice. like going stadium different experience watching game home. yes, theatres huge trouble. already overpriced. Corona might nail coffin. Sadly, many theaters close good.

Hollywood spend less blockbusters. superhero movie cost $200 million? I'm sure $60 million.  long one life saved, collateral damage worth it. 28%* Oh believe it... president showed debate late refused tested... need explain, conspiracy. 
Population control mass vaccination know, “poor countries first get free vaccine”. think Germany reason already testing massively back then, sure could much affected countries like Italy Spain. obvious fact. ""attack messenger"" fallacy thing woman red looks cool fuck could be, again, cares? 3 majority votes (DC, Senate, House) DC state. reason Dems keep Republicans happy. again, bother? shows already working this, it’s financially viable most. president discounts intel reports directly affect military’s ability respond. Military leaders authority plan execute attack without presidential/congressional approval. Considering US given 120million tests Russia given less 50million tests, yeah rookie numbers. realize number still 7 day rolling average trend still upward, right? Prof.

We need America. governor democrat. 

Indeed. 

But — party suing governor eliminate coronavirus restrictions, including mask mandates? Transparency. total death count aggregate death counts thousands individual death registration offices country, data publicly available. hundreds smart people analyzing numbers. Add plenty economic social data. inconsistencies found. Also, thousands local people involved creating global stats; conspiracy involving thousands people, information guaranteed get leaked. write anything cause death, difficult verify, can't conceal mass disappearance people current day age. US, Dec worst cold life, woken middle night body aches could barely handle. lost sense taste(no idea smell) I’m sure was, would surprised covid. never got tested antibodies, wouldn’t gone anyways?  also factor America's influence -- negative positive -- rest world, especially post-WW2.

Cases go up. ""But deaths hospitalizations down!""

And on...  rate before. Two week lag became four week lag Europe looking 6 8 week lag, going high before. Pretending happening accusing people ask numbers brigading stupid. Yeah you’re comparing *infection* fatality rate chances dying various activities general population. One starts ill already, second simply leaving door driving.

What chances person 20-49 dying covid generally across US population compared cause death? everyone stay 100% top developments. listen publics health orders all. regarding question, know cases going up, deaths going up, however, seeing rate deaths beginning. answered questions, answer simple fact better treating it. Wait, Carmen Sandiego!?  live Latam almost same: 30% people streets use it. Hey look.... nation administration desperately wants sister country... glad go life bleak, miserable outlook.   record Broadway shows streaming services pay distribute - possibly pay actors full year wages compensate (since large popular plays bought Netflix, Disney, Amazon...etc).

Honestly really enjoyed able watch Hamilton quarantine. Several articles mutations, however, nothing far say cause alarm. However, longer virus wanders around organism matter, chances mutating something different something vaccines developed would work would require whole new process (different seasonal flu strains).

Some science community claim covid mutated something infectious *insert Leonardo DiCaprio* - India see. Apologies ignorance.  😂😂 much talk shit anti-maskers online, gotta admit... I’m neighbors’ air spooge sometimes. It’s easy forget one supposed there’s decades life lived near-opposite way. adhering guidelines months. Now? 

The mind almost forces think people we’re around ok certain period time. “After months months, they’re infection-free, always be” subconscious thought. Consciously know none us ok. 

But yea, 5 mins participating neighborhood complaint power outage w/e, might remember interaction potentially life affecting run grab mask. 

The self-awareness depressing. forget selfishness.  getting info? know trumpublicans DON’T wear seatbelts helmets though. virus complete meme Sweden shown us. one takes seriously it’s cunty. sky blue death surely come us point. that, shot. 

Reminds old Deming quote. “In god trust. others must bring data” House stupid send bill Senate stimulus check individuals.

Trump said would approve it, make Senate deny it, cost votes. Yet Russia cheaper healthcare.  *""Healthcare Russia free residents compulsory state health insurance program. However, public healthcare system faced much criticism due poor organizational structure, lack government funds, outdated medical equipment poorly paid staff.""*

People still encouraged travel Halloween.

People still encouraged eat out.

People forced wear masks largely it. pro-virus detected What...? Every expert saw coming. US government think worth preparing Imagine president even apolitical person earth fucking director naiad throws shade Compared peak March/April number people actually infected probably close now. We're testing way more. Everyone even mildest symptoms tested. March mostly people risk group tested. remember true infections much lower March/April there's need level panic. need recalibrate many infections grounds measures. E.g. 20 000 per day March/April way different 20 000 per day now. Economist article long ago estimating amount people infected march/April much higher numbers said.

Obviously saying nothing done. Implement measures adjusted true rate infections. March/April grounds lockdown. countries keep infections control measures without shutting society, even number positive tests similar. infections keep rising, implement measures, let things start going again. Otherwise risk people protesting following measures. vary measures regionally obviously depending local infection rates. I'm tempted resort one. annoys hell can't make appointment get one online total jobsworths drop one. still pandemic it’s goes Italy too. Remember two weeks ago people claiming cases hadn’t climbed “they still scared” “they take seriously”? Can’t wait people blame reckless youth parties  Psssh. we're afraid of? tiny little pincushion? defense Disney world - pandemic aside - it’s massive resort dozens uniquely themed hotels, hundreds restaurants, four world class theme parks, two water parks, tons activities like golfing, boating, educational tours etc. easily spend 10 days without getting bored without leaving Disney property.

I don’t know. folks lot experience looking situation saying “nope.” I’m considering perspective. want shut anyone questioning anything covid response. DISCOS 

Unfortunately even 2020 kill disco. claimed knew begining fomite transmission known non-factor. 

Nope. clearly stupid understand difference science formally declaring something science simply statement every bit epidemiological evidence points away chance rule yet. would like claiming science rules water safe COVID, going drink water. June, way would died dehydration then.

Never argue drunks idiots. hope drunk staggeringly stupid. even pegged person wiped groceries hysteria proved right. Thats requires lasting immune response virus mutating considerably. indication either true virus There’s also pretty obvious split men women parties.

Putin commit genocide (not even sure got from), irresponsible fingerwag Russia much destructive imperialist force likely live in. Putin obviously great person easy understand he's popular guy stabilized Russia American right-wing coup. Compare Russia post-Soviet societies tell awful Putin stupid Russians overthrowing him. deaths. economic societal impact. people still hospitalized surviving (so, obviously counting towards death toll). lingering health issues (some minor, pretty major) suffering disease. easing strain hospitals care-facilities keeping ICU beds available (which now, keep going way might last long). inconveniencing people who, even might survive might hospitalized, might get ill go horrible weeks unable work, unable leave house, unable care family.

It's thinking anyone else change.

I understand we're making worldwide pandemic fucking political. polarizing issue. sooner wear masks outside (even strictly government-mandated), wash hands diligently, use disinfectant, keep distance people, work home, stay home much can, minimize social contacts much possible, better turn everyone.

It absolutely deaths.

But nah, people throwing hissy fit can't go see grandma bars close earlier might cancel wedding. Fuck right bullshit. Colder weather = cases seems Russia trying bizarro America People want hear that, exactly globalization going negatively impact high cost countries regulation occur. workforce work remote, get someone place standard living far less? Personally think Fear Inoculum sucks. Sounds like rehashed previous albums, progressive new music. Like ran ideas. really hope schools end safe seem be. truth it’s still little early tell cases. didn’t seem open Labor Day (or right before), 6 weeks out. data looks quite hopeful, things still good another 3-4 weeks pretty happy. reality though, takes cycles disease see relaxation regulations going make difference. Also, likely assume first term quarter comes end schools add many person students result also Troy enforcing mask distancing rules coming month see upswing spread schools. honestly hope I’m pessimistic! you’re hyperbolic. 

Try actually countering people saying, instead making stuff counter.

You also avoided question, I’ll assume concede United States lockdown. Something something rookie numbers... true communism impossible can’t get every nation agree it. understanding correctly? go. Idk reliable really interesting. It’d interesting think this, might get covid future experience little cold. ever stop trolling lol sub believes studies confirm already held beliefs.

That well said COVID-19 crisis continues, Broadway League announced delay reopening shows New York stage. ***All Broadway productions stay hold—and offer refunds exchanges—through May 30, 2021.*** Dates returning new Broadway show announced individual productions determine performance schedules respective **“With nearly 97,000 workers rely Broadway livelihood annual economic impact $14.8 billion city, membership committed re-opening soon conditions permit us so.** working tirelessly multiple partners sustaining industry raise curtains again,” said Charlotte St. Martin, President Broadway Shows initially set shut April 12, June 7, September 6 January 3, 2021.

That's lot moving goal posts. Also, nearly 100,000 workers impacted, dates continuously pushed back reopening, **I wonder Broadway regret later** workers decide change careers remain housed fed. certainly impact entire workforce NYC people poor work. Plus tourism revenues drop. point people say ""enough""? someone works retail, I’ve also noticed true according actual statistics don’t really care people believe want. Please plenty people US Sweden back July laughing countries banned entry. virus nothing meme shitfling political opponents. France fine like US, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium. going hurt lot restaurant industries, care saves us office folks money

Plus better environment We're world leader international affairs 330 million people 50 different states, lockdown never chance working here.  yup pretty much skip zoom classes now, get bored yeah zoom classes suck too...I skipping mine lol cheap fucking trash lol. paying plenty antibody home tests stopgap damn thought Michael Gallup saying this...jesus christ need get head ass Vlad smart live COVID bubble. like fighting army androids shittier happened vaccine? criticize them, call antisemite. happened vaccine? people actually toddlers inside adult bodies. matured. probably never will. prizes coming outside Catholic heaven - disabled, paints interiors. Electorate. Hah! second. UN USA could put sanctions china demanding wet markets. astonishing amount viruses come china last 100 years. world needs stop China able continue affects humans, country. joke legit question enough ppl asked guess everyone joking sarcastic. 

Point is: Russia came saying vaccine months ago ahead rest world pretty much disproves it. I'm saying. definitely both. family uses logic one told last week young friends passed probably themselves. One age, healthy, existing conditions passed week it. It’s fucking infuriating. surprised, food fried oily (and therefore good) even think widely available, honest. vaccine rolls out, it'll harder spread. cases drop, things open up, people get vaccine every day. know tell you. Italian comorbidity list something like 11% prevalence long list comorbidities ahead it. It’s crazy amount license plates NY, NJ, past week near FL. people vacationing pandemic?? don’t get it, stay home! see point. Now, argue something else said, know covid deadly flu, also SIGNIFICANTLY spreadable well. Hence face masks thing. don’t shut people wore consistently. don’t. millions die, economy Romania. live Mormon Capitol world assholes can’t even bothered mask. I’ve never life seen disregard fellow man religion claims “love thy neighbor” “love one another”. get it. hard wear mask? wear magic underwear think save mask much bother. It’s infuriating say least. think we'll see 350,000 deaths next spring Sadly people respect human right harmed thus countries failed, too. 

The governments duty people responsible enact measures protect constituents. includes restriction rights improve others. people follow required procedures, governments duty demands actions. include restrictions rights. government willing/able so, government people, farce. virus unforgiving fuck complacency. comeback kid r/RussiaDenies saw AZ vent cams. Oh oh!! Russia’s turn finally?? curiosity, constitutes big event? Also, since aware timeline reopening Switzerland else surrounded it, think need context. Anyway, aware large amusement parks Switzerland, though know Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain large amusement parks opened summer still open. going anywhere news getting really old. 


People keep getting dying. part world. 

No sense constant state pseudo-emergency. ""correct"" side told ok hate Russia.

No one remembers Obama laughed Romney's Russiaphobe comments. limited 30k. little half capacity. But, watched race F1 never crowd shots people crammed couple sections. they're designed avoid worst parts disease, like dying. South America comparable Africa terms population age. fertility rates countries like Brazil, Chile Mexico lower first world, decades now. old Europe surely young Africa 139% vote 121%. deaths, hospitalizations, it’s cases. HA! U.K. recorded 17 thousand yesterday, suck it....oh! stupid ""ScIeNtIsTs"" fighting anti-lockdown, anti-masks, anti-vaccine.

Like Bruh happened supposed vaccine...? sarcastically made fun you? right? Yeah majority gonna die, everyone gets that. think majority people want grandparents still around immunocompromised. selfish pull stats ass mean are. article less day old - Congrats! Spanish flu second wave worse first. mask wearing, temp checks, hygiene, social distance, almost even keep economies running people healthy basic straight forward guidelines. don’t think you’re ready would happen that. virus people underestimate affects someone know, think drop restrictions we’d know multiple people severe case, we’d begging help regardless feel now. assumed died June. July. $600 unemployment bonus ended. Around then. misspelled ‘mentality’ Yeah Utah Valley resident sister SLC I'm often. guys taking WAY seriously people here. Pretty much every store go says masks required store I've seen enforce Walmart. Everywhere else seem care much someone door telling people required people take store employee say anything. I'm sure he'll keep taking steroids rest life. could wild ride! When? Shiit, FL numbers DAILY Russian F1 Grand Prix Sochi held two weeks ago - approximately 30.000 attendees every day (over three days). friends bartending still said establishments nice regulars staying home base vocal deniers try argue people don’t care entitled jerks. lot crazies too, there’s random attacks nightclubs violence frequent used work. That's love people like ""bUt HoSpItAlS aReNt OvErRuN"".

News flash: things necessary keep hospitals overrun *need continue* order *keep* overrun. like can't study pass first test class nothing else. honestly aware rules regarding activities France.

Parties banned bars open? Really?

You dont wear masks crowded restaurants invite bunch friends house? Really?

You confusing irresponsible behavior rule breaking.  essentially looked Fox News right wing talk radio America

Come on, entire history Soviet propaganda, Fox News child's play. want define ""shot up""? significant increase relation standard deviation short amount time. exactly FL saw terms cases bit later terms deaths. Way prove point sociopaths demonstrate easily eat propaganda. 

[Gateway pundit real news america russia.. two peas pod think whole anti mask, anti virus, virus fatigue mentality starting slowly take lot countries.....

we, human species, terrible patience managing ourselves. stupidity kept us alive long. stupidity kills us clarify, 14,000+ healthcare professionals calling finding sustainable ways protect vulnerable without destroying world, dozen Stanford Well even reason drop restrictions herd immunity threshold Link without paywall:http://archive.is/rcGLp Vast majority media, mainstream, US owned 5 megacorporations. Whether Fox MSNBC, serve exact masters. politicians. said, difference serving different audiences feeding tham different bullshit. prime example Russiagate. twitter thread it. 3 years democrats fed paranoia Russia practically controlling American government. now, evidence came out, turn 99% bullshit, pushed probably knew it, least suspected. Also, highly recommend book. ""record new cases"" low compared would celebrating get far. one sociable country strong family friends bonds. Also high mobility high tourism, Cv19 rebounded strongly summer. Guessing Russia also trying detective. I'd bet $421,000,000. People like reason really care virus. Released emergency situations drug use - given select people (healthcare workers teachers - former contact sick people, later nature job interact lot people) situation calls it. Everybody else expected access least January first results phase 3 available. That's actually pretty smart. knew county would shutdown due ""cases"", I'd avoid getting one costs. joking, government annouced raising retirement age, ruling party's poll numbers fell significantly. bunch drama queens.

Totally glosses fact theatres sort suck need make serious changes even without pandemic.

Fuck throwing money another industry refuses improve Well, might get see God soon, say ""Who think created Doctors""? Wasn’t like reduced capacity? drink higher alcohol presentage vodka That’s estimate, that’s best case scenario. realistic scenario seems doses everyone fall 2021. much joie de vivre. people idea unemployed destitute country like Romania say tear jerking platitudes? get treatments someone’s favorite president did? Yes, government decided lift mask requirement declare victory virus weeks later. 404'd think people spent long living absolute terror feel need ensure everyone else feels terror, thus spreading horror stories without solid data. 

Sort like ""young healthy 20 year old dies COVID"" stories, there's always rare exceptions disease. stories cause fear. It’s impressive New Zealand, China,and North Korea done great job controlling virus. course true. Governments rarely scientifically literate, also seem qualms lying country order meet certain goals. meant said information best patronising. People supposedly told need masks due ppe shortages hospitals. can't pretend benefit hindsight, terrible idea. China MUST held account shit control assumes lot things:

- threshold absolutely 70% .... don’t know sure yet, maybe worse maybe not?

- trying almost completely eradicate/significantly limit transmission

- even aiming mass vaccinations and/or herd immunity via vaccines something UK China example seem interested in

This vary wildly based policy, even states US like Florida literally said fuck anything approved. Source? agree american politics shit show. good bad people sides, mess.

The mainstream media USA mainly problem. new outlets forecasting end world since march, 3 week period June stopped reporting Covid (as disapeered) focused solely BLM protests/riots. Basically encouraging people gather streets 100,00s.

Its kinds mixed messages getting since March. told march would lockdown 2 weeks ""slow spread"" 2 million would die. 7 months later people still want lockdown stop spread. Everything changes time, makes sense. 

Most Americans value free will, promise would take virus serious warranted that. people see blown way proportion hard get us stay homes, blame us? want us stay homes go broke ""in 2 weeks gonna get really bad"" hearing since march yet get bad.

Rip 200k died im sorry cant go broke staying inside. Many Americans lost business livlihood. easy answers clear day need live w virus safe, lockdown homes fear go broke. guess winter coming early. guess go 12 pack toilet paper shit hits fan lol Kids teachers need sacrifice lives altar rotten yam Thanks kind words. I’m sorry hear friend hope comes end okay. Tipping bullshit practice, tipping still makes asshole. testing lot People *never be* born vote Putin   kept hearing Germany virus control. It’s simple wear damn mask! knew finished thought would dim ones extrapolate themselves. would do? Declare war? Send China back room? Stop buying cheap shit mess weak economy? Anger China probably make Chinese stop buying counties millions dollars exported food? 

Politicians angry it’s point punish China punish back. dont understand restrictions way go?

 youre doctor tells socialize contagious wouldnt that. people think citizens wont listen public health experts.

The Swedish Public Health agency gave recomendations people followed trust expertise. different trusting youre personal doctor me. false. comorbidities listed death certificates direct result infected covid19. Stop fucking lying. 

What lie about? people dying Covid comorbidities and/or old. fact. iffy part statement expecting survive long anyways, even then... given many deaths happened nursing homes, still lie. office 1 positive case discovered Tuesday, next day asked get tested, today 6 cases total. around 50 people total. office still running positive covid sales department (bc closest contact first case) given option work home. despite fact Shelter Place period IL, office employees given option work home. also required come waiting test results unless fever.

I worry bunch incubating cases. now, people lax mask wearing, still person meetings closed rooms hard maintain distance. lot employees smokers 50. asthma. do? Beware *oats*. Where? Andy Cuomo welcomed virus open arms. Yes understand fact US never really come first wave. 

Whatever want call it, beginning another surge new cases Fall/Winter approach 4% population 25% cases.  Countries less resources money handling better are.  one gives fuck countries doing.  US flat enough address pandemic 100% due unwillingness so.  MLM = Multi-level Marketing New Zealand responded swiftly decisively.

Not even proactive US states responded late. Laws public education. And, shunned peers. 54 80s everyone used get shit faced bars drive home. Agreed. 2 mil lot worse current prediction 400k. herd immunity threshold (~70%).

Possibly 20%! Gupta - Three Myths: 3 - nowhere close herd Cool vaccine bro countries use 1 meter. go figure. Well, time amount skyrocketed last week steady couple months, time least justify use ""smashed"" expected 1-2 weeks ago you’re pro-facism tactics? Lol mental gymnastics people go justify government placate anxieties “measures” I'm talking Germany. I'm talking places like Czech Republic, Netherlands, UK, France, Argentina, case counts adjusted population higher single day U.S. post got old fast... No, aren't. Considering Russians already quite wary vaccination is, would cause overwhelming outrage. would chance foreign country buying it. longest time, certainly Missouri.. Go back LS! No. It’s ready yet. Sweden one highest fatality rates world.

Fail. Stop. Lying. Honest god needs become criminal offense.

What lie about? stated objective fact backed stats made musings questions that.  Technically restrictions extending pandemic save lives. everything opened up, thing would tear population quickly. 

The death toll going route worth though. someone lives China, I’m concerned Japanese visitors since China least virus control number months now, Japan still community infections would like incorporate handwritten experiences, could write send would happily include it! Yes am. India can’t shutdown, people would starve can’t work. rather young fit population, much obesity. all, America far worst combination fat dumb. I'm favor wearing masks public. Every time I'm public place I'm happy wear one. point shaming people normal things, like going family outings, gym, movies, etc. opinion, things, dont love neighbor? cold, going get bad correct, really secondary option amphetamine. comment used amphetamine class, including methamphetamine it. Sorry confusion! shame getting shitfaced home. worries finding way home, already there! That’s weird way phrase things Trump likes people get virus.

...oh wait. really hope reopen someday... daughter hit height requirement big rides anxiety could end goes long real. even reopen tickets prices skyrocket compensate. Yeah. objective get numbers back low. Reduce community spreading forth. US 4% world's population 25% cases.  one gives fuck countries handling this. Many places servers minimum wage minimum wage industries. $2 sounds insane me, job. Remember folks, CCP lied absolutely everything before, mean lying now! /s  - No
- No
- Russia hot spot HIV years too, virus difficult spread coronavirus. better contact tracing places. actually bunch evidence support AZ's improvements. noted long article written NYC first-responder supervisor. 

They badly back-logged ambulance calls due find one bed. Many, many times got home address next pickup late. 

He compared number deaths typically per shift pre-Covid rate NYC’s bad spike, crazy high. Many workers PTSD seeing much death people couldn’t save. 

Most deaths cardiac arrests. plenty recent articles heavily favor use masks. approach epidemiologically clinically, hypothesis-generating articles particle size dispersion physics. people still wearing mask, huh!? reminder, world population three times higher Spanish flu. Huh. 8 coins cost trump paid income tax last year time come gone business. Fair enough think missed point. 

I basically providing another possible explanation China able suppress virus. due CITIZEN’S COOPERATION. 

Regardless think, China suppressed virus. Doesn’t matter think say it, doesn’t change fact. I’m glorifying way things, heck I’m glorifying outcome. 

Idiots ruining reopening everyone else think it’s hoax, threatens freedom, simply doesn’t care. better?  Hmm, state. low per capita deaths smart restrictions gradually opening measure works. I'm sure that's really difference. Cell lines derived, that's work. get new batch cells experiment. using foetal stem cells scientific experiments get handwave away saying, well stem cell line came aborted tissue collected 1980s. fact thousand generations since collection remove moral issue hope  Orange bad people thread fucking braindead Well duh!

You learn anything told answers.

You figure-out schools outbreaks own!

There quiz. Okay first all, particular article referencing global impact. nations already made vaccine deals. continue measures post vaccine? Sure, maybe couple months (if people even bother that).

When roll back silly TSA rules 9/11? American living full time Canada pandemic certainly opened eyes lot things believed without question living America experiencing anywhere else. 

It night day, black white difference two countries leaderships conducted themselves.

I cannot imagine giving single life protect person completely unconcerned protecting human life. 

I suppose really want say is... Dear America, stop hitting yourself. Like know ur troll maybe find something better ur time lol Well RIP you, people? Yeah. learn Cuomo's assertion ""it never happened"" false. According report New York State Department Health, ""6,326 COVID-positive residents admitted [nursing home] facilities"" following Cuomo's mandate nursing homes accept readmission Covid-positive patients hospitals. Whether ""needed,"" fact happen. I'm sorry loss. That's hard way learn real hoax. love short-sighted always is. Like...don't afraid, let dominate you....

All people going get sick end stuffed closet corner somewhere like ""but....you said...!"" Oh yeah, know. understanding it’s really even medical/scientific journal used reference. 

The Lancet one esteemed influential medical journals industry. happens lobbyists allowed buy anything want America. Italy* ""I hope never happens again, events politicized"".
Doesn't sound like happy called ""Trump's czar"".

Anyways, that's promising news. robust efficacy signal lot investment landscape. ""I want everyone treatment I'm having."" like Trump truly ignorant. truly understand much anything, lost fog confusion. People putting scripts front read papers sign without understanding much all.

I think want thank God madness mostly inflicted America, stead going war China, North Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan like could have.

In stead, greedy Republicans saw easy fall guy - easy scapegoat set one blame dirty tricks passing Republican laws. virus contagious, nearly severe enough animal reservoirs. always going become endemic. realistic lockdown ever going eliminate worldwide.  acquaintance contracted covid.

They’re selfish, entitled assholes. Oranger oranger dumber dumber husband &amp; ones consistently attending family events. can't even convince 92 year old mom stay away people. alienated members sides family. really hurts miss milestone events well regular celebrations.

I wish they'd read subreddits like never will. tried explain masks worked cousin tried come visit let sat outside mask - 10' away our, thankful, long porch. gave the, ""Do even know anyone it?"" bit. Unfortunately, able say yes even though personal friend. looked totally shock, thought said guessed he'd believe since telling him.
This cousin spouting ""fake news"" refute scientific facts trying explain offer send unbiased science links phone could read compare actual data back BS spewing could send I'd . response was, ""Oh, I'm gonna that."" nothing fear. knowledge, understanding knowledge, knowing deal knowledge.



Your actions keeping economy closed, struggling. bad can't see that.


If think everyone else terrified, that's problem. Genius, let say argument lol 

My argument dog little nothing useful February - October. straw manning me. us understand mistakes happen. 6+ months minimizing denying mistake; bad person attitude. can't believe buy shit. Even now. virus still spreading like wildfire summer months fall months posting kinda shit. drives lot conspiracy it’s saying anything “after pandemic, people might still wanna wear masks wash hands more”. It’s useless information.

What exactly think ""New Normal"" supposed mean politicians pushing term? told would going back ""pre-Covid"" life. pretty clearly communicated everybody beginning. guess ""gravely ill"" sounds better hospitalized death bed. Well know almost assuredly hospitalizations. would mentioned. words schools end result. Jesus christ one prolonging pandemic, it’s going away there’s vaccine, thought would obvious people now. vast majority people get infected normal people trying get live lives. It’s worth building much hate towards them, serves purpose. need mask outside, that's ridiculous. live metropolitan area upwards 6 million people put ~2000km bike summer wore mask. there's enough room free space bike, need mask. Gets dumber every time clone him. know exactly beat spread. America country selfish, self-righteous assholes can't bothered make small changes protect neighbors...so are! reason don’t drive maximum 20km/h 100% accurate descriptor. utter condescension. they'll keep browning noses thinking they'll also sniff roses. see place corporate man ride along? see passengers wearing 3m 8511, hope enough. Overweight people expanding due stress Covid Risk. funded research development space program without turning profit.

We developed technology necessary internet without turning profit.

We spend almost trillion dollars year military without turning profit.

If want direct example, VA hospitals built maintained profits. literal example ""need small positive margin"". good thing part Obamacare makes sure preexisting conditions covered.

[Oh, Science works ?!?! thought Trump said science doesn’t know. gets oranger oranger guy tested positive late september. probably trump. So... made it. Got it. US seeing resurgence, cases never went low enough that. They've rising ever since.

Yes countries seeing high numbers nowhere near 50k+ cases day like use word ""hoax"" implies COVID real, absolutely is.

""Overreaction global scale resulting systematic transfer power wealth"" better way describe it. research go research validated real-world scenarios Melbourne Australia? 

Why lives teachers, families, community around schools appropriately factored in? 

What long term impacts covid19 young people? lack mortality metric considered here. Covid19 sorts lasting neurological physical impacts. good idea. I've sort given now, back eventually.

I'm comparing nations dealing hardship, total war far devastating this. hand military good manufacturing consent unity propaganda. people wanted conveniences, wanted horde, want told eat do, go, massive efforts every country encourage right behavior, patriotic good. would think would common fucking sense.... mean we're never ever going back old normal?

They telling us since April.

I dont know people think ""New Normal"" means.

It means ""new"", becomes ""normal"".

If plans ""go back"", wouldnt pushed term ""New Normal"". means permanent change. going back ""Old Normal"". people could go back, ""new"" wouldnt become ""normal"".

This pretty explicitly spelled everybody. figures would blame families “losers”.

We’re going go right back up. Mask compliance low, businesses bars opening, school back person. Governor already said numbers metrics result new restrictions. Fuck taking 5000IU tested 69 ng/mL. cut bit 3000IUs.  blood test came (in-network) little $30. Insurance paid part annual physical exam.     

I found cleared Vit deficiency, auto-immunes started straightening out. There's lot stake keeping even keel Covid-19. I've always thought that, system focuses pound cure (that enhances shareholder profits) ounce prevention. today’s Excel spreadsheets handle 1,048,576 rows 16,384 columns, developers PHE used older Excel file format (XLS instead XLSX) resulting template able store around 65,000 rows data (or around 1,400 cases). limit reached, cases left template therefore positive cases coronavirus missed daily reporting. So, MarketWatch isn’t trustworthy? Let’s contextualise France experiencing “a larger outbreak US ever experienced.”

It’s latest new daily cases 18,746. US peaked 75,682 July remain around 50,000 per day. Adjusting population, France’s current max *just* higher U.S.’s max (27.9 cases / 100000 vs. 23.7).

Moreover, France eased restrictions June government ended state emergency daily new cases fallen low hundreds (a rate US never gotten near orders magnitude).

That obviously mistake, new restrictions mandates steadily come back effect July. However It’ll help curb spread another disease would take even resources would increase hospitalizations immunosuppressed people putting even stress hospitals they’re already getting, so, still get flu shot concern panic buying masks would lead shortage healthcare workers much risk (as asserts final statements). look bad although new research efficacy masks come since fauci emphatically telling people wear masks.

There chance whatsoever happening. Dems win, want take ""the high road"" move Trump rather keeping focus him. think good politics investigate previous president. reason never went George W. administration officials war crimes. 

It took 8 minutes someone respond comment noting need ""heal move on."" That's country feels. Anyone expecting justice served severe disappointment. Biden wins, single Congressional hearing Trump next four years. general consensus thread fact MarketWatch news outlet Yes, keep adding death toll though seems slowed bit peak July.

Okay sure news source allowed

How follow? want sceptical NHC report, sure. want see want ban it? even official compassionate use auth, though? I've wondered that. ton irregularities whole thing, many unanswered questions ... correlation Wisconsin spiking? mask mandate months now.  going back normal whether loners sub like not.

lol, sure are, slick - sure Mandatory quarantine upon entry due limited space/staff quarantine system number daily arrivals capped. airlines also made expensive fuck fly home. 2 lbs. think they'll ok. bats... cats...

People, isolate dats!!!  shudder think 4 years Trump Scott Atlas plan. We're expendable. It’s overrun, pumping out. in, weirdo religious freak? No. 

As technically correct? don’t know know lot scientists, pretty precise comes work. Maybe that’s what’s going here. you’re confirming comment helpful? Cool. significantly less tests.  would argue nothing political accusations flu shot protect coronavirus Southern hemisphere cold countries getting fucking hammered despite efforts virus seems near impossible stop cooler months? do, fucking blows. handle mask thing concerts. Limited hanging friends. Limited travel. soul suck. near 100% chance money. people staying home working home huge impact many business would survive. that's get milder restrictions like limited capacity bars restaurants. People can't think critically. went back normal precovid behavior ""extreme"" I'm certain would millions deaths point. People view virus ""extreme"" fighting it, masking etc. like never row boat saying us reacted got side easily. 🤔😣 think risk groups generally aware belong risk group. probably follow recommendations large extent. everybody course. 


Here Sweden different recommendations based age. seen backlash. blew that.

It case dropping lockdown point. 

It one thing declare it, another actually implement it.

And case impossible enforce -- poor population, people working informal sector, could even distribute helicopter money people without creating superspreader events people bank accounts credit/ATM cards gather everyone together give cash, etc. etc.

The government tried, Peru poster child social inequality leads time crisis (for which, course, government ones blame). make better worse? go worse. Go near military bases, see AK HI day. Im DC base see tons AK, TX, WA, FL. MI, ND, ID, HI, OK seem popular. Obviously include DC, VA, MD local. goal, maybe principal goal. **The** goal? basic knowledge. Even article states vaccine may may necessarily impacted new mutation ""I take responsibility"" Pretty good reason continue restrictions it? Woop woop 20 lbs lose I'm 25.0 BMI.

I've lost 50 lbs far since January.

No regrets. parts Arizona absolutely beautiful, going it. seem young don’t understand history. 20 years ago, people thought it’d pipe dream people wouldn’t able smoke inside. Big Tobacco much lobbying power. it’s norm. 

You also think simply everyone doesn’t something means shouldn’t changes made rules law use logical fallacies like saying “well, people still shoot people. people still smuggle drugs”. doesn’t matter still that. matters harsh penalties acts act deterrent. That’s needs done well.

If Trump loses, I’m pretty sure turn anti-maskers you’ll see penalties increase jail
time.

Hell, used force jail people Spanish Flu. look Typhoid Mary That's get serving Trump syndicate. Fuck you. Run Republicans, checks out. Baby showers aren’t important. They’re materialistic games awful. important mean parents gifted essential items help newborn yes, are. problem supporting loved ones like need shower so. party isn’t necessary. Meanwhile Wisconsin, mask mandate one enforces including law enforcement. anti intellectualism, toxicity stupidity runs deep here. ~~Big true, seriously hope everything goes smoothly~~ apparently wrong Sweden's cause death numbers however far 2015-2019 average cause deaths, especially controlled population growth. narrative epic failure overblown product count COVID death is. Even still examples Nordic countries took longer buy masks still haven't, especially population wide all-times type masking philosophy. 

My core issue masks depend high level compliance long period time clearly achieved many populations, re-evaluate strategy using instead blaming people stupid, telling like Eastern countries. Sorry, happening, might well stop wasting time trying make work beyond come better strategies, whatever might be. Plus force people malcontent get, help compliance. cares though, easier sit around call people stupid murderers. Good luck pulling ""put mask times get thrown jail"" thing West. 

Also speaking eastern countries Japan rise cases July? flattened since come on, nobody immune this. makes “drive by” stunt even disgusting. didn’t think even possible. vegas odds?  Probably you’re asking, don’t fuck religion. Trump led disgraceful life enabled luck birthed wealth. can’t tell there’s omnipotent letting shit happen convince that’s entity deserving worship. 

Trump probably lose re-election, go back fucking children live rest life luxury. Filed under: shit Wow rude sarcastic response someone whose stupid skeptical anything. Shove ass. People fail understand every time virus infects new person, chance mutate entirely makes kind promising vaccine useless.


Does mutate something deadlier, friendlier human body important keeping distance much issue masks. Giving hugs handshakes.

New Zealand. Finland. Norway. South Korea. Hong Kong. Singapore. Vietnam. Or, know, places world suppressed virus seen resurgences soon stop severe measures.

What severe measures? NZ one laxest measures since reopened May. Even 'lockdown' Aug, restrictions group size limits **100** (and 10 Auckland). currently gathering restrictions. goes countries social distancing unfalsifiable beliefs: cases go down, worked, go up, hard enough.

Yeah, funny trend actually mirrors real almost mask wearing social distancing rules.

You realize they've limited maximum number diners 50 mandated tables sat least 1m apart, right? places forced closed violate guidelines? think social distancing rules?

The also goes Swedish schools asked ensure similar social limited public gatherings encouraged work home.

Again, realize social distancing rules? people work home literally significant method ensuring social distancing carried public transportation workplace.

Buisnisses makes difficult follow recommendations example easily shut temporarly safety reasons.

So back quote, ""not currently recommend broad use..."" ""currently recommend broad use..."". Yes, going way state recommendation. also saying wearing mask bad thing.

Or use fire analogy. forest fire, health agancy would probably say recommendation people bring water fire. water effective, 10.000 people driving fire 5-30 liters water each, way firefighters tries job. time recommend use water fire.

In case, water proven effective fire, recomendation public bring water fire proven effective, least yet.

First came social democrats... Refusal wear mask follow public health guidelines needs become criminal offense.  Everyone willing wear mask already so.  rest need held accountable. Dr Joan Ramon Villalbi Spanish Society Public Health Sanitary Administration told Reuters still early draw definitive it’s one result, always want data, studies, samples confirm rule laboratory error methodological problem,” said.

I doubt result strongly. Since this, hasn’t replication. 1%er people people $ Still rookie numbers. Population ~144.5 million. We’ve 12k cases per day Florida population ~21.5 million 😭 Vaccines 100%, everyone needs vaccinated previously infected. looks like she’s new version Watchmen. ""Why let die, God?""

""I repeatedly sent news reports epidemiologists public health officials telling avoid things, ignored them.  is."" I’m still railing Windows 98! adorable actually trust COVID reporting coming Russia. saying USA underreporting well, think actually 8.8k/1M downright Humanity come together 2 weeks 

It never going happen. We'd stay like months keep virus out, like China, West that. look around reddit, everyone thinks everything affront civil liberties, think locked houses going something okay with? Chicago average 300 new cases day. Hopefully others same.

Key words ""during pandemic"" meaning Moderna likely enforce patents later. Moderna successful technology, making plenty money future. us don’t worship science. think they're second get approval, they'll ready. I'm Nashville resident – logistics public testing absolutely spectacular. think there's vaccine here, we'll get distributed quickly. Wait Sheboygan man hears this. Local lockdowns high areas announced Monday. National lockdown 23rd. rumours going... wait see guess... comment makes sound haven’t missed meal quite while.  Science isn’t putting food everyone’s table. ""The number new coronavirus infections France jumped 20,000 one day first time since start epidemic, health ministry data showed Friday.

Dehydration quite dangerous left uncontrolled, get medically managed asap keeps happening. However, Covid perspective suggested GI symptoms associated better outcomes: "" Unexpectedly, observed GI involvement associated significant reduction disease severity mortality..."" hope helps. called fatigue. 

Psychologically speaking, first thing people expected months heavy restrictions go opposite way celebrate newly regained ""freedom"".

That's strict lockdowns worked select countries utterly failed others. Sweden got right putting lax yet still ongoing social distancing measures psychologically sustainable long term. cases young healthy people killed permanent damage yes sides need tone hyperbole need start discussing real viable solutions Especially know wear mask... Ah summer. like us, too. more. South Dakota creepy governor blink talks. think they're remote spread. area (OK) like numbers going up. Even then, gave people longer life better chance survive vaccine. define left wing critical Capitalism, thing left wing media. right-wing way dominant mass-media outlets large profit-based operations, therefore must cater financial interests owners corporations controlling investors. 

[Manufacturing situation definitely great, state control media, even majority. Trump full autocrat, able bend state without question.

While compare elements point out, two yet equivalent. 

Based Trump's words complaints, know *would* already slowed testing hidden numbers happened. There's always conflicting information. First report people contracted 2x likely restaurant past couple weeks prior. recently New Jersey, Gov Murphy saying he's seeing link rising cases indoor dining. this. 

Maybe New Jersey lack link due indoor dining still relatively new development (Early September). built concentration cam... err... ""hospitals"" keep COVID diseased people different areas outside city. shut _everything_. business. Quarantined every traveler. Banned movement cities. Squads people disinfected empty streets. Anyone positive entire family relocated locked down. Actively monitorized people surveillance apps phones. 

Not even virus would want live place like that. time, makes virus containment data believable. country could contain it, willing pay cost. Fear induced deaths would follow curves, though. 

The deaths seeing posted area, likely make irrational decision COVID risk vs risk whatever killing you. bright side election brighter chance stop hell elect new one. response deserve. It’s happening Greece too. People attitude like virus isn’t here... India: got competition. every word mans mouth become post here? testing? I'm really surprised.. No, I'm saying work - immediately use it.

And yeah, accept something without knowing works. 'because said so' - that's sane. No, vaccine bunch materials combined make 'vaccine' - that'd react body, know whats going on, works, - 'they said so', that's understanding. Understanding everything, looks safe enough based body, ok. I'm agreeing covid bad need exaggerate make point. must give side ammo. leave permanent large proportion cases. definitely statement misleading. people around saying we're good governor's restrictions lifted. say it'll different election. people tell latest infections nearest hotspots are. Confusing. Sorry double responding read stuff reread comment found claim death count 10-100x flu deaths last several years combined depends heavily error here. 

The error estimate you’re talking measure times flu actually contributed someone’s death *any way.* doctor reason blame death due least part Influenza, write such. also true COVID-19. Comparing verified death counts much much valid comparison. 

The flu estimate isn’t merely catch everyone died infected flu didn’t get tested it. uses every bit relevant data think adjust actual death count upwards. tries capture full extent disease’s burden, every last bit it. even considers deaths where, example, flu worsened someone’s pre-existing condition got flu later died pre-existing condition. **fundamentally different measure raw death no, error cannot 10 5 even 2 times official count, haven’t enough deaths cover kind error. 

I’m sorry *way enough deaths* cover kind error. 

~55,000 people died average week 2019, total death count year ~2.85M people. coronavirus. far year averaging ~62,000 deaths per week, pace hit ~3.24M deaths end year average holds true.

We counted 218,000 COVID-19 deaths far year, average ~5300 deaths per week attributed disease. 

Which means 62,000 / 5,300 = 11.69 roughly calculated limit maximum error factor COVID-19 estimate could have. plenty room estimated death count double, triple, verified death count, know many people tend die year, know many people died year. hundreds thousands millions unaccounted deaths. simply case.

No, course hundreds thousands millions unaccounted deaths, disease rages undoubtedly leaving wake thousands tens even hundreds thousands unaccounted *causes* death. 

Just test someone COVID-19 dying come negative mean COVID-19 contribute death. get idea did, much like flu, need take external data account, like die from, chances ever contracted COVID, chances exacerbated pre-existing condition created new preexisting condition ultimately led demise road, long COVID infection subsided. **This flu estimate calculated comparing COVID’s verified death count misleading think likely case true death toll somewhere official count total excess deaths, something normal distribution centered middle range. 

Again, seem equating “true death toll” estimated death toll, that’s fine, need understand “true death toll”/estimated death toll, way done Influenza, much higher includes people whose death *any way* secondary COVID-19. includes people preexisting conditions COVID made worse went away condition worsened later killed them, people COVID created new pre existing conditions eventually went onto contribute death, despite active COVID infection time death. attempt use best information whatever relevant sources calculate true burden *entire give probability number 10x number flu deaths 2018-2019 year something like 1-5%, true flu deaths actually lower estimated nearly excess deaths covid. 

Bruh. flu season saw 14,510 verified deaths. already seen 218,000 verified COVID-19 deaths last 10 months. already well 10x verified death count influenza year. really need look flu estimated, consider estimation techniques likewise multiply COVID-19 count, **despite fact test much COVID-19 Influenza.** Primarily COVID, like flu, exacerbates preexisting conditions. It’s estimated/“true” death toll extends far past caught killing “red handed.”

You need consider fact flattening curve freeing hospital beds resources influx severely sick patients. People dying high rate virus compared flu. remember us worrying freeing hospital beds Influenza 2018 literally year living memory? Seriously, think it.

For example, let’s say see spike brain cancer, study COVID find 15% chance causing brain cancer 6 months contract virus. reasonably guess 15% total estimated COVID cases probably ultimately got symptom 6 months later, add estimated death toll. Similarly pneumonia deaths, actually *has* spiked since COVID introduced. study COVID find causes pneumonia deaths, fancy math figuring percent pneumonia deaths likely due COVID, well, despite never tested positive disease. heart disease internal organ diseases find scientifically derived statistical data COVID causing health problems lead death help us adjust estimate model **true** impact COVID. goal zero cases need lockdown ASAP stay locked vaccine simple. chance happens. Even vaccine, PPE, etc. many idiots wrong thing, including guy charge minions.  New Zealand, Vietnam places managed pull off. impossible, requires right policies people adhere them, two things proven difficult world.  That’s mood days:

We'll lucky get that, imo. fraction population know people continue socially distancing level been. Especially cold socialize (much safely) outdoors people start socializing inside more. covid immunity finite, vaccines help either we're going live it.

A. vaccines may provide broader immunity disease (e.g tetanus vaccine), see vaccines could administered yearly/bi-yearly.. (like flu vaccine)

Duration immunity definitely important unknown death matters? death like fashion? covid new black?  grocery store worker believe true. told keep quiet first time case like 3 months ago never told us case came that. grocery store could hotspot, depends precautions store doesn’t take. there’s “high risk” people projecting thoughts prayers, rather following facts science. It’s going happen. virus ever present risk, masks mask. Social distancing social distancing. Learn live till vaccine comes out. absolutely right, good immunity whatsoever, even temporary. That's exactly vaccine manufacturers after. also keep mind CDC said antibody tests aren’t accurate. said even accurate antibody tests might wrong half time. alone could explain 20% testing old people getting sick dying. 

It whole healtcare system getting overloaded. Netherlands already postponing care, surgeries, closing regular departments hospitals make corona wings. impact much bigger. Unless want deny healthcare people covid (which happen) disrupt whole healthcare system. Taiwan lockdown instead utilized controlling borders, South Korea focused heavily contact tracing quarantining COVID patients. Many smaller nations opted similar strategies, get discussed much. Everyone talks China beat pandemic, beyond lockdowns, one really aped strategy much. Testing, quarantining, sufficient hospital space made China's strategy workable, Wuhan's lockdown. yeah really wired. last 2 days 4000 cases places germany going redzones...

So, yeah, cases Rona... It’s not. good day. Even edit aggressive, trying start shit, exact opposite “apparently”. next suggestion find something better do. I’ll blocking now. governor knew NFL full stadiums, trying get political optics win, actually full stadiums. make sense local officials saying get vaccines saying, “we can’t use yet?’ understand getting unapproved vaccine, point announcing that? going keep armed guard 24/7? really going wait approval vaccine hands? 

I don’t know he’s even announcing unapproved vaccine hand certain day.

I’m genuinely puzzled. Well...at leaat 19-22 year olds infect others high risk groups. will. get reversed long time ago? Still would whole country would leaving singificant population centres like Massachusetts, Oregon, Wisconsin, Minnestoa.

So please don't, live parts Canada kinda tired Canada defined Ontario Quebec. surprising all. Lots men hopeless comes self-care others think masks turn instant wimps worse. Sorry dudes, actually *manly* wear mask means care...at least little. It’s embarrassing British PM he’s joke.

*At low rate actual positivity*, test may come back 50% false positive. Let give example illustrate. 

Let's say false positive rate 1% (most antibody tests actually lower). city actual prevalence 1%, get 1% actually positive plus another 0.99% false positive (.99x.01) total positive rate 1.99% (ignoring false negatives).

But say take test city 20% actual positivity rate. get 20% actual positives, another 0.8% false positives (.8x.01). false positives nearly actual numbers (.8% vs .99%), make much smaller amount total positives, therefore much less significant. 

The true reverse false negatives - low prevalence, they're less important they're percentage true positives, higher percentages play larger role. again, roughly real life number (5%), we'd see 0.05% false negatives city 1% actual positives 1% false negatives city 20%. actually hope, degree, mask wearing becomes normalized long term. ""every person wears one go public time."" I'm sick going store get medicine something? Mask on. Even ""just cold,"" could something makes someone else much sick. Throw mask go inside there. Or, flu outbreak getting locally bad? Recommend masks public places people short term. !RemindMe 4 months lets see happens

My prediction: less 350k total excess deaths, per NYT excess deaths tracker. less 300k deaths per official COVID stats. full hospitals? anyone update publicly many ICU beds available?

This huge problem antibody tests there, although really hope herd immunity high. Honestly, sensibly, there's LOT benefit getting usual surroundings. sort see they're coming .. SORT OF!!!!! really high compared many countries. Currently #13 keeps dropping # cases/deaths per capita present time European countries hit 2nd need shut places people getting infected figure reopen places safely. shouldn’t opened cinemas without first figuring ventilate also mandating masks must worn never removed people cinemas means popcorn.

They're sowing potential long term mistrust short term political gains. I'm tired seeing word exponential misused Reddit. number people sick went 1-3 week, would exponential. went 1 100 would exponential. word exponential literally means nothing unless giving context i.e. exponent?

Trying improve brand image cancerous baby powder drama... purely political decision, slap face country's biggest ally.

Since March we’ve eaten even coffee.
We don’t leave house without mask wear till return.
We live city people don’t give space anywhere it’s unbelievable current climate.
We go necessities husband works home.

But like plan - keep reddit updated goes? yeah that's wired. stop traveling partying we'll never get rid this. 

the thing summer Lufthansa got much money keep alive, politics say traveling save biggest mistake made. 1th Lufthansa unemploying people even recived money traveling brougjt us many new infections. real plan travelers really plan right now. saw Merkel talking today say something new something would help.*trust people* always say work anymore... article suggests generally, vaccine immunity worse immunity infection. described possible unlikely.

It's true vaccine could administered annually, given low rates flu vaccination hold breath widespread annual covid vaccinations common going forward. dangerous enough average person they're going care, especially rural parts America. Sigh, I’m going single fucking long time. Yep, already looking forward president Biden know say: “If nothing done, mad, something **is** done, others mad nothing happened first place.” 

There always unsatisfied people. reality is, all, 215k+ people died 6 months US alone one best measures look excess deaths. tried give definition FIB comment removed incivility lol. imagine means, guess.  said, mostly kills old people. flu cause severe effects even death children, lockdown protect them? Wanting normal life back isn’t evil, protecting primarily risk should’ve plan start. We’ve fucked entire generation kids alongside economy. pick dramatic words use illustrate point- ""SMASHES 24 hour record"" ""so SLAMS so"" flu season it? hope people want lockdowns every flu season on. Yeah sometimes wonder people Reddit make life goal empty skull trolls internet. think comments witty funny cringeworthy. show post worthy discussion makes lose even hope humanity. come world full many idiots? Yes, dead ones contact live ones, likely. Testing death value, especially far community concerned. Half town dies Covid (gross exaggeration), counted... ""nothing see here, folks"" makes sense. Shut inbred pasty white fuck. point there's vaccine that's widely available without obvious short term side effects see state things changes. shit BWay open least May.

Also others said operating margins shows awful unless packing cramped 100 year old theaters cannot afford keep shows open anyway.

So regardless government regulations...unless finding several thousand people per performance want pay $100-500 per seat sit elbow elbow strangers 3 hours they're can't afford open. local government helping. Hope: First wave finally over. Guess vaccine worked wonders! Tipping crying masks probably American thing short shooting place Russia usually called Eastern European country. majority Russia's population lives European part country (West Ural mountains), that's geographical aspect. Also culture, much common China, India Middle-East. lavish praise premature, like harsh criticisms sunbelt were? dad went russia summer (i happy him, came back tested negative fine whatever guess) one wore masks seemed like care there. interesting know definitely still high numbers. agree completely. Unfortunately people realise important independent journalism well functioning democratic society. I'm sure solution ever happen.  Uhhh really? declining probably flat 3 weeks. 91 112 weekday line. think main obstacle June date they're able get casts together rehearse. year+ going require lot brushing up. Looking numbers seems France it’s super low ratio ic-units population headcount seems haven’t learned thing spring outbreak. healthcare system needs provide beds hospitals u know ? 
Because people get sick time don’t save money here! 

They 16 icu per 100,000 people 

Whereas USA 50% beds (25 p 100k) Germany even 34

As death rates, honestly nothing going on. still super low despite surging positive tests weeks Pet peeve: metabolism ""ruined"" anything. Things like ""starvation mode"" ""metabolic adaptation"" pitifully tiny effects get amplified clickbait articles referencing endless game telephone they're massive effects. We're talking double digit change total calories consumed per day (which actually explained reduction nervous energy) get single digit body fat, returns immediately upon refeeding.

Edit: Also, anyone cites Biggest Loser study (the usual culprit comes ""ruined metabolism"") safely ignore them. study bad people poking gaping holes day published. gets cited lot happens reinforce narrative lot people like - losing weight counterproductive.

I believe difficult. Believe me, know feeling, trying lose weight since start lockdown I'm *up* four pounds. Apparently stress eat. body breaking, trying save you. body mind own, that's you, mind, thinky bits put foody bits noisy hole.

I get tired disempowering myths around weight loss. Weight loss, management general, quite simple. simple easy thing, hungry *sucks* long time get anywhere. toxic Murdoch culture. sells. distracts. Hannity Tucker seen newscasters everyone watches them. one doesn't, especially courts.

Absolutely 100% false, exact opposite true, metric. RIP jobs economy. one silver lining currently belief flu season *shouldn't* bad year we've never worn masks social distanced it. said, get [flu covid] probably bad time. Dont worry Czech same. Even worse, people blame government (the people called lowering restrictions situation good), refuse masks say flu. Ironicly ones make worse last longer. French, recently moved France. one BIG observation far: Y'all need stop lunches fully packed *brasserie*s. Swear god, they're cramped full year ago. distancing, reduced seating, nothing.

Also, feel like I'm able make judgment lost TWO family members Covid one week apart. otherwise healthy 45 year old 66 year old - gone blink eye. deserved better. Sure, compensate losses pocket, ask others pay ideology. Oh also happen paying less $750 taxes? Pic looks like scifi movie guy right shit.  Jokes aside coat great   Yep 17 % increase hospitalization past 10 days, 29k 34k (US). Europe increase even pronounced. Right, exactly people skeptical Trump's claims might vaccine October. even asked Kamala debate would take one came out, I've seen people complaining said no. wants take rushed, untested vaccine pushed due political pressure?

The careless disregard truth fuels least part pandemic. fault Sweden responsibility people spreading misinformation. Russian Covid-19 Vaccine? Let tell thing called non-profit

Maybe heard subreddit, many hospitals non-profits understand Russia number problems, America, advanced, richest freedom loving nation solar system still handled poorly. completely forgot Russia Instead musing buying greenland, maybe see Russia wants bought out. think sufficient offer oligarchy could pretty successful. basically ruler apparently. local cases mean pockets undetected cases. likely is. caught attention authorities yet cases isolated pocket. 

There cases kinds diseases existence, isolated, waiting super spreader. super spreader comes along, authorities notice take action. aggressively shut down, extensive contact tracing, isolation.

In China, likely many pockets infections superspreader, remain isolated, mostly harmless general populace.

If practice basic pandemic protocol, reduce super spreader events. practice, like White House, super spreader events happen.

When China detected local infections, means super spreader events fir detect, mean infected. lady looks mad she’s photographed lol wish ... got banned week much less ... countries dealt SARS, part, enacted strategies used 2003. He's made one two manicured videos last 6 days, one front greenscreen. barely breathe them, he's coughing phone call interviews Fox News. So, there's sign whatsoever he's recovered. others say, he's entered today window really bad symptoms supposed begin.

They tell us results lung scans, even he's tested positive not. Czech Republic Prime Minister needs remember respect human rights. right way deal covid lawful, ethical, human rights-based interventions entail public health powers tailored specific risks encourage people voluntarily comply possible accomplish legitimate, communal doesn’t follow redditor agenda America bad, China good (New Zealand best). bad EMS (Japan post) still shipping Australia. bought 2 guitars months ago intermediary company charging double EMS rates use another courier. Unfortunately, seems enforcement COVID price gouging. Keto awhile ended much cooking. Maybe I’ll go back I’m cooking lot anyway! Right I’m high protein reduced calories People literally acted like back normal past 4 months. Sure seems like 2nd wave warned approaching. Cases US climbing steadily well. 

Good thing states much prepare coming onslaught like Florida... *Gotta pump numbers up. rookie numbers racket. myself, get twice much day.* \- US smoking illegal harsh penalty (sic) live? important remember whole ""flatten curve"" thing ensure flood people overwhelm medical infrastructure. good job realized hospitals across country fine, people started get freedoms back. sources US numbers come history accurately reporting information. That's makes think still are. think second account so. elderly, died year instead five ten years later. considered elderly, died year instead ten years later.

I'd rather see grandparents die disease. I'd rather see friends chronic medical issues die young new virus. That’s like positivity rate 1-2% overall. Testing increased regions testing much higher 83 days remaining end year. 

Sept 23rd last day recorded 1,000 deaths last two weeks deaths trending - slightly. 

Although cases trending recently aren’t levels push death toll significantly next 2-4 weeks.  

IMO think real risk post Christmas Jan - February, keep virus retirement / convalescent homes winter. saying barriers perfect undoubtedly reduce exposure particles.  Factor distance, pretty safe I'm currently 32.5 losing 25 pounds since March. got positive test late July test take work (PCR) positive ZERO symptoms before, during, since. Never planned getting tested except work. Congrats OP, giving hope. Human trash. luxury better population density sort thing could prevented deaths nursery homes. said, boy want live Sweden right now. Phone doctor health service today, week. wait till next week. might spreading actively without knowing it. cases countries... dont understand means close? Open, get rid anti masks people everything easier shithead. Haha ”mass homicide” either trolling well informed bag rocks. Seems like masks working huh? Well, duh. confirm. Two weeks ago 1 5 supermarket shop wore mask (lots elderly quite expats live neighbourhood). Yesterday shopping 3 4 wore masks. can’t enforce “obey killed”. Yes, get tested self-isolate. So, neighbors south? peeps charge really want damge control certain group people responsible mess. Chinese people know protect ignorant. Simple that.

People feel geniue safe dont like countries commit mass homocide  Every single case exported China, directly indirectly. Per capita Florida still cases 3380/100,000 vs California 2145/100,000. seven day case count Florida also higher. yeah campus provided, cloth, could find surgical ones I'd def prefer case, per capita, too. that's true lot things too, since we're pretty rich. false. Cases dropped state already got virus since people asymptomatic, got get again, cases obviously drop.

But yeah, cotton masks polyester gators savior. every thread screaming raving sweden, fuck hurt you? People got tired restrictions. long fully mobilized? becomes dire situation again, guess people take seriously again. Well Catholic church literally banned priests wives afraid influence. good salesman use every angle can. freedom!! /s country (the government) keep pointing fact infections home. 25 get infected class spread 75 homes least. 

I know intent misinform us way hide fact children spreaders. Yes country Netherlands government says masks spread disease, children not. octopus would facepalm 8 arms. I've tons blood tests like make sure effect heart, kidneys, liver etc. happy results. Pretty much trying fix lungs now. Vaccine seems working. live Strasbourg tested negative two weeks ago,no waiting tested,no extra wait get result.

This week son needed urine stool sample analysis,lot people waiting,extra time results.

Weather humid,not really cold now.
So hope nobody get seriously sick home fall winter.
It hard top good care even non lethal disease.

Stay safe! ...and kill kill kill. Let’s support that. 👍🏻 anyone thinking easy, save empty platitudes. 5 million people lockdown longest period service ""beating"" virus Nah idiots always loud. Distraction. magic word, say repubs go insane. It’s weird takeaway exact opposite fact. Seems likely parts military would get first health care workers second. service men women get sorts questionable shots. medical workers first something went wrong, tons medical workers middle pandemic. 

For clarity, value everyone's lives saying right course action, likely course hearing relative involved vaccines Texas. but.... controlled spread virus effectively.  Enforced lockdowns nearly 100% compliance mask laws combined Orwellian privacy laws contact tracing trick. much testing, asymptomatic/mild cases discovered.  “Weather”? Dr Madick, buy trexamethadrone like Trump used cure hoax-vid? doctor keep eventual heart complications? doctor tell something regarding it? Bro I’m saying trust CDC guidelines complained they’re trustworthy stories keep changing lol. 

I didn’t even say anything White House administration science staff. He's private citizen. Best wishes recovery. trump said it... watched clip talking fox coughed 4 times one sentence. world’s consensus standard care wear mask. guidelines based best available science, made world experts. don’t get come normalize fringe ideas act like huge debate happening medical community. settled. Pack bags take shit thoughts elsewhere. Hope Swedes happy becoming country cripples :D.

And useless population still atent anything. Un-fucking-belivable. point is, vaccine 70% effective, need vaccinate almost everyone. Herd immunity achievable vaccination. That's point. vaccines rolling out, wait hit threshold herd immunity. go ""hey got shot over"" *you* may immune shot.


What's confusing concept you? people really think we'll vaccinate entire fucking country day? Look around ffs. Lockdowns restrictions failing quickly becoming unsustainable world. handful countries Asia done well, none faced situation now. Even places initial success circle jerked struggling massively, like California, Czech Republic Canada. You’re delusional don’t see that. 

Yes, it’s possible people’s family members die, obvious risk people gladly take normality basic humanity lives. people mature enough realise god, tragedies happen, sometimes can’t make big bad go away, robbing everyone year lives many years economic depression isn’t worth disease whose average age victim average life expectancy. 

I don’t think I’m fucking special, I’m normal human. get used hearing voice ordinary people, it’s get much louder. media always dramatic? know women excluded fucking coverage huffpost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Who's China eh bitches?

Hypocritical bastards... Blood clots issues coagulation covid-19 infection elevated average present patients. Iirc Harvard studies read subject percentage around 30%. So, no. Also connection yet studied properly still lot unknowns.

&amp;#x200B;

Those unknowns precisely people careful posses enough information infection yet also, amount hosts continue breeding ground potential mutations may may cause lot issues also completely bypass natural immunity develop previous strain virus. 


We even know immunity built long lasts immune system SSD potentially store memory forever. quite dum-dum actually viruses. There's nothing special China. Every East Asian nation well considering circumstances. praise China specifically; praise East Asian cultures general. even anymore. People around parts give flying fuck masks. think misunderstood angrily agreeing comment replied to. No, could not. Read article, kust magic masks, also closures many businesses. find likely that's actual effect. Let’s first see study results. Found Mormon District Columbia mandate face-covering public. Thirty-three states currently require people wear face coverings public curb spread COVID-19. District Columbia Puerto Rico also have mask orders place.


The Department Health, state commissioners governer make lawful orders enforce mandates protect citizens live within state.

It normal laws place state emergencies. entire country experiencing pandemic citizens stupid one things help. Yes, masks mandatory states declared law. First time Reddit? wish could start replacing stupid, aggressive, selfish, narcissistic, fatass Americans law abiding Japanese put introversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, agreeableness pedestal. Yet UK, prime minister silent almost 2 weeks, despite cases estimated 17k+ daily. ???

Our leaders take advice female doctors top positions.

Our women better yours, 

Damn rights theyre better yours, 

We could teach you....

But wont. get sick one thing, immune system busy fighting that. Essentially, guard likely catch something else. 


Like obese person high blood pressure, body working overtime body function. can’t fund many resources protect something else bad. Thats mean. Norwegians best can. See America still top baby CDC says 6 feet better make 10.

This whole problem revealed sort of... racist science worship? Let explain.

Apparently nothing world real true confirmed peer reviewed plurality Ivy League educated doctors AngloEuropean research institutions. Nothing. Even sharing knowledge save hundreds thousands lives, nothing ever true proven already happened.

So CDC ignored preventative cautionary information given China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan - countries covid us dealt really well. Why?

I’ve thinking lot, think people extremely racist. think yellow people lie. It’s weird. Even intelligent people believe science appear blind faith true believers.

That’s good. Science skepticism. assumption virus bad, neutral proven bad. Nobody saying “there isn’t evidence harms children” that’s harm maximization, harm reduction. Interesting simple word order shows absurd agenda mask lobby. actually see drop thanks closures, no, author put masks first reason. getting ridiculous. Yeah, absolutely pathetic people always assume absolute WORST ANYTHING write. sickening. someone likes employ sarcasm often, even give shit anymore clarifying. Cheetah snacks dusty tortilla chips? What's that? True, small number deaths unavoidable. However wide rapid spread US didn’t happen, never exposed.

It always going pandemic, it’s scale means deaths avoidable. $15,000 day mass gatherings Briefings Tuesday Thursday, updates currently Tuesday Friday. Notes today earlier week:

Edström, chairman Sweden's United Student Unions, also attend press conference.  asked student unions nations. view taken measures reduce spread infection, says.  want events canceled, instead carried safer way:  better corona-secured events reduce risk unorganized events corridor parties.  also says student movement condemns social events follow Swedish Public Health Agency's recommendations.  asked case campus may close down.  Already today, local infection control doctor together university management close universities colleges spread infection becomes extensive, says.

Cattle arent smart, herded.

The ones arent cattle already complying....because know history. :) Went month lockdown ended. half people either wearing masks covering mouths. literally yelled sanitizing hands entrances. I'm talking crowded places indoors here. Totally wrong priorities. 

It much worse Czech Republic restrictions all. could go clubbing fucks sake. don’t get you’re saying. ones preventing seeing grandma. Whether decide expose covid much (wearing mask not) pandemic completely avoidable. Many deaths we're completely avoidable, could avoided people took pandemic seriously. Raawwr Russia smash!! Plus “pneumonia” deaths. God help influenza winter. I'd love see cunt outed. place probably CCTV.  Coronavirus endemic United States, United Kingdom many countries; general population. examples Coronavirus worked way population lock stopped contact tracing random testing could keep control? can't think any.

There's point return. Covering parts body protect outside hazards incredibly natural humans, hence clothing. don’t say write plain simple. looks easy often t...

Thank make mess understandale! Fevers frequently give nightmares. Also especially worried situation, may also lead nightmares, obviously. No...we not. government numbers, plus numbers ONS ZOE surveys. different. messed thing nobody seems care injuries, unknown cause death. adds incomprehensible amount wasted human potential. people fine. danger disease large numbers. Finally finished watching documentary read Alex Parrot found point knew actually read learn anything Pepperberg claim Alex could use ""language"", instead saying used two-way communications code.

Deaths yet talking making thing mandatory. course wants print narrative deaths rising, even though data suggests otherwise. POLITICAL QUESTION

Can anyone explain what's happening Trump? *I'm asking solely regard trajectory virus*. understand recovered quickly, symptoms. ignorant? possible someone age/fitness nearly symptoms recover quickly? scientists skeptical resilience, perfectly possible recovered well claims?

I personally know 95 year old successfully fended COVID-19, know possible so, even extremely high risk category like hers, also hospitalised weeks recovered.

Thanks scientific explanations -- fully accept may ignorant. Thanks. sure people arw reason politics need say something. *trust people* work still hold this. get think worse, honestly. care killing vulnerable people take excuse behave selfishly. tech nerd get appointed head CDC? I’m worried bad December going be. think Thanksgiving going make things much worse. Madrid worse rest country, mostly legal issue. court decided yesterday central government legal using laws trying use, they're switching 'state emergency' gives broader authority impose restrictions. Restrictions?

Americans dont restrictions. protested guns weak fuck gov backed enforcement. age well: ""Chris Christie says country accept son, that's adult using simple dating system imaginable even someone like readily understand it. know numbers got infected like 2 weeks ago. opinion little bit late. would told us travel summer? inbet number would much lower. learned let people still travel. what's big Deal.with traveling? get answered question. people know bad got trump makes trump look even worse. hiding prevent fallout. real possibility pull would completely fault trump. Imagine ""trump killed gov. Christie"" headlines. okay.

Aside everyone remembers history 100 years ago... Yeah people follow guidelines well, 500-600 new cases day despite testing 25-35k per day, need testing more. suprise...sad happened beginning like countries...

Fuck Donald Trump! killed many selfish behavior, dare like say, want demand status quo replaced something else idea make happen, maybe don’t know you’re talking about. really afraid COVID. sure letting COVID dominate life. It’s people wearing masks “not working”.  [Real underdogs wear less cute ""animal activists"" goes farm release wild live porch. saying.. 215000?

I’ve worked org 20 years expected stay retire. really love it, don’t know anywhere close form year now. understand thinking reopen country wear masks. Ive seen seems enough understand thinking July. cant understand insist masks start. imagine someone told said that, people might continue behaving cautiously economy would suffer.

When said going full lockdown, assumed would quick lockdown small area infections couple weeks leave everywhere else open. imagine policy would be, fuck dont care anymore.

To honest there's easy answer. comes virus kind always question stuff media nobody's friend never trust one source accurate information comes anything important. See CDC say. Go check updates local health authorities, crunch numbers using Covid Tracking Project resources. trust openly source necessarily wear tinfoil hat time, exercise healthy skepticism use multiple sources, formulate intelligence act on.

Good luck Listen *scientists*, *politicians*. latter gives objectors platform attack us.

For example, state governor states goal ""return normal 2021"", governor following science. experts agreed ""old normal"". Puscifer, Keenan also leads. ‘Murica: “Hold beer” following curve Netherlands, Belgium Denmark 5 days delay Italy following curve Germany another 3 days delay. curve, total, high Germany compare population sizes, there's guarantee going stay way.

I'm sure politics, rather people irresponsible virus fatigue. always worried Berlin big party scene lots footage bars, parks forests full people trying relive nightlife   Similar scenes playing across France. COVID-19 patients occupy 40% ICU beds Paris region, nearly quarter ICUs nationwide, several weeks growing infections among young people spread vulnerable populations.

France hasn’t added significant ICU capacity staff needed manage extra beds, according national health agency figures doctors multiple hospitals.

For comparison, Germany entered pandemic five times many intensive care beds France, similarly well-developed health care system slightly smaller population. date, Germany’s confirmed virus-related death toll 9,584 compared 32,521 France.

The number virus patients ICU quickly doubled last month New Civilian Hospital Strasbourg, atmosphere surprisingly calm. AP reporter watched teams medics coordinating closely manage trajectory treatment patient according strict protocols they’re accustomed to.

Dr. Debbat Arles said training ICU staff takes several months, he’s relying personnel levels spring, worries could burn out.

“I’m like coach one team, reserve players,” said.

He also worries non-virus patients, already put back burner earlier year. worries upcoming flu season, sends 2,000 patients ICUs France every year.

What old white men smoothing terrible news. good majority people can’t notice 

That's Western propaganda great. lie time get away it. people consume Western media know media lies they're stuck believing opposing political parties lie. That's gist media focused domestic issues. international news, expect fake news 24/7 country enemy West. believe media lied past (Iraq WMDs) they're currently lying now.

Western propaganda hides behind sources. quotes dubious people research media corporations held accountable news turns fake. They're relying people verify information directly root source. That's smart. people read headlines. it’s citizens can’t notice. 

Chinese propaganda filled positivity. government want talk negative news censors information. Unlike Western propaganda, Chinese propaganda even like putting countries. That's Chinese people still rosy picture United States.

It's people notice Chinese propaganda. notice since censorship obvious. someone deletes post, know censored.

There's also this: real world test, interesting (to least) Chinese students better spotting differences fact opinion countries. Shirkey even think public health emergency. Ontario bunch armed morons show guns whenever concept lockdown discussed? That's deal here. don’t think ever fully started, tbh We're dans la merde Correction: countries aspire like US.

Want like China? Cut country's internet great firewall. Impose censorship criticism govt. Persecute entire region cos native residents conform national identity speaking language. quite macabre subject. present, 7 day average deaths around 750 day. rate death toll 1st Februay would around 300,000.

The big problem winter - know influenza, deaths Southern Hemisphere rates far higher. using predicted ""Flu Season"" October March likely death rates increase. 1000 deaths day total February 330,000 1500 daily (not impossible given thet reached 2200 day peak back April) 385,000. best relevant comment second half 2020, specially proves correct. Even not, doubt, difference makes absolutely crucial. aids way deadlier.

aids requires sex. Would rather see show one night, spend rest life ventilator? know message 5 months old, research glimmer hope anyone getting diabetes due Covid now. Covid horrendous yet new much known stage. I'd like see young people rise make Russia democratic nation year 2030. fully think possible. vaccine now? figured. heard early one eager ventilate people, think led unneeded deaths? Obviously, ones fault considering new virus one knew exactly treat it. responding mostly portion said inconsiderate assume Mormons know teachings Jesus. Although I’m sure Mormons interpret teachings differently, there’s solid overlap think.

I think OP getting something like follows:
Love thy neighbor arguably Jesus’ famous teaching, wearing mask seen act consideration towards one’s neighbors/those around them. Accordingly, it’s antithetical doctrine it.
I could wrong, don’t think OP connecting love thy neighbor mask thing door-to-door proselytizing Mormons do.

Argument year right 👏 Grocery workers spreading this. spread dumbasses going clubs bars parties (of ages, skewed younger). Yeah okay 👌 Berlin, there's always idiots wear doors. -_-

I saw one lady covering mouth hand...

And people one period...they even try act like trying. Ahh yes commission defenestration know well context pandemics, akin bad novel influenza, slightly worse. Look deaths last couple flu pandemics, ones 1957 1968. one would minimizing influenza deaths actually knew history influenza pandemics--and no, shouting Spanish flu count. 3 days Call doctor. positivity rate 10.4 %, clearly rising last weeks. Shit. Flexing low case rates Nunavut, Yukon northwest territories kinda weak given combined population like 8 people Since Bill Gates health expert? Mostly super huge sports events - icehockey, soccer on. festival season over, big concerts happening, icehockey season (icehockey popular around here) starting. know unrelated mention ladies outfit point. got coordinated mask everything, that's kind style sense want. 5.4k/day , 10mil population :( czechia 20% densely populated city. would expect disease lagged rural areas. certain things hope never hear another word over:

1) Hydroxychloroquine

2) Herd immunity

3) Trump would imagine fines individual persons much businesses. sounds article primary targets mass gatherings, places allowing non-compliance. restaurant following max person rules, and/or allowing people mask-less...then fine. Meter maids actually fantastic idea- feeling ordinary citizens report places without hesitation. 15K probably enough small business (gym, salon, small restaurant) impact, would depend much make following rules vs loss fine. larger Corporate owned places, even close enough deterrent. helped NYC months ago took away liquor licenses..etc. stupid NFL coaches complying threat losing draft picks play- 100K nothing said.. keep fining me- pay it. free mostly free treatment really big deal hospitals capacity resources limited? Dude, get times. Covid deaths matter right now. can't believe literally trying ""All Death Matters"" rn. Smh many states US mandates masks large fine moment. take NYC example. sure, hearing news outbreak, reality limited orthodox jewish community wear masks. everyone else NYC does, Jewish high holidays, positive percent rate 1% months end. still hovering around 1%, even despite recent uptick, again, caused people WEAR MASKS  about? Nightclubs open since March. quarantine two weeks coming UK everywhere handful countries 'travel corridor' list. LOL no. Less boomers hate anonymity pretty harmless. hate Facebook get doxxed killed. heard Dakotas experiencing recent Covid surge. scientist, originally hailing Saskatchewan, Canada (just border), decided simple comparisons what's happening Alberta Saskatchewan what's happening North Dakota Montana. [The results pretty even know novel means? Good lord, like arguing fucking Like claiming start counts February.

When people started die large numbers Europe reliable news reports it: Yes. Start February consider 9 months, ~1M people died COVID annually, 1.5M people die TB. say knew fomite transmission beginning. evidence? article april.

Science clear beginning COVID transmits via air need wash hands. explicitly come say ""stop wiping fucking groceries"" mean science supported, advocated suggested good idea wipe groceries. probably busy working vaccines, identifying risk groups effective treatments factor would people stupid enough actually wipe cereal boxes. paranoia lack information surprise since apparently think COVID started killing people May. concern Putin pushing vaccine rollout October prior phase 3 even starting. 76 people vaccine point claiming good go. They've also done providing data independent sources verify efficacy. internal agencies even advised roll prior phase 3 completing.

It's fair point Putin think rational skeptical puts obvious reasons. reason trust anything Trump's mouth. speak quality ability Russia's scientific community, though. absolutely hate abilities potential Russia's citizenry scientific world elsewhere constantly undermined him. I'm sure too. Yeah let stay inside smoke weed work lose everything. Yes, jobs, want keep jobs still work none ever happened. work field impacted covid all, begs question hell supposed small children?

All this.

I thank universe loud every morning family healthy (so far) spouse safe WFH jobs cover bills (so far). alone puts us fortunate category non-uber-rich people. 

We also reaching absolute limit endurance. 7 months taking care newborn preschooler, ourselves, working full time, without even getting grandparents give us hours respite. 

If *we* exhausted imagine bad Americans small kids, statistically better most. postponed wage national effort pinpoint corona get his/her contacts push R 1 eliminate it. 

Give people money/ get quarantine somewhere seperate main population. Indoors outdoors?

In German city people good indoors mask mandate noone wears outdoors. Nonetheless almost cases here. outdoors transmission risk really big long dense crowds. believe Russia modern democracy. I'd personally prefer massive peaceful public uprising leading power transition result restoration dormant democratic institutions gradual liberalization political economical systems. Seems unlikely almost entire government system built prevent that, Putin loyal police forces suppress protests. think transition period, comes, extremely hard Russia.

As Putin's fate, care. agreed peacefully resign guarantees personal safety freedom, would support making untouchable, although believe deserves life sentence. he'll never that, trust guarantees anyone, many enemies. think he'll probably betrayed someone circle point, power diminishes. Lmao 3 months already. long wait? Give lots clear examples actually game changer.

Such as? bring b/c literally thing did. honestly think America cease exist December. like Legend. go exponential deaths, could conceivably 200 million+ deaths December. I'm fucking embarrassed American. shortage irresponsible behaviour here.

That every single country, look America like ones irresponsible.  case funneling billions dollars research?

How much money think spent cancer research? they're military dictatorship literally detain lock special covid ward test positive.

If *every* country simply gone *that* route back *February*, situation currently in. Obviously, *waaaaay* late that, course we're it; damage already done. thing keep good track public health policy mistakes (for example: countries except China locked late), we're better prepared guard future pandemics.

We could've gone back normal *April* (just like Wuhan itself). nowadays we'll *never* go back normal, *general opinion public health experts* believed. compare SARS-1 virus, 8,000 confirmed cases compared COVID 37,000,000 cases rising? 0.02% many cases! MERS 2,500 confirmed cases.

Also, 2009 swine flu vaccine first human trial July 2009, FDA approved September 15th, widely available early December. Quit fear mongering. Actually, considerably less dangerous children flu. dangerous elderly (hence high death count), children extremely low risk. lots clear examples actually game changer. obviously people wear them, make difference. Sinophobes pretty active today, huh? busy blaming Americans problems instead looking other. Great post. guess Putin vaccine hot.

Wonder Trump vaccine better?  carmen sandiago? right. That's whole thing about. Short term sacrifices live another day well future. mom dealing COVID, she’s mild symptoms. today dehydrated diarrhea. advice? 
Is Imodium ok take? Florida Saxony Give week math far off, that's 83 per million. 
For reference, spain slovakia last week.  
And Germany 24. (Ger) putting stronger rules place regions surpass 35 per million. covid immunity finite, vaccines help either we're going live it. Hahahahahah Come Russia streamlined elections!!! videos people getting locked, outside apartments. Yeah that’s fuck huge level slow Covid like measure will. Yeah, believe still held Portland show NBA suspended season.   flight november padova, go? Im madter student :( Social distancing masks dated far back plague actually.  think public officials deliberately undermining lockdowns make case lockdowns work. deliberately made seem like everything flattening curve gave unimaginative public impression end game. Apparently people general capable understanding people magically stop infectious daily number cases evens out. mean seems really simple do? course did, compounded coming election. Washington state lose inslee culp win. restrictions lifted watch comes Covid. goes rest country. IFR back earlier stages around 0.3-0.5% range. improved response protection elderly, think much closer 0.25% range currently. 

Here good study Germany back May. Recent followup studies show notable decline fatalities. trying minimize devastation could eventually 600k Americans die Wave 1, mutations leading millions American deaths lifetime. Umm... statement profoundly stupid. work healthcare? guess no, would made statements. Typical nurse patient ratio 2:1 ICU, influx NY ratio much higher. friend ICU travel nurse said one shifts 6:1. Caring patients sick specialization, ratios poor higher risk medical error, care worse, staff exhausted. Also many patients, go PPE, wasn’t enough of, healthcare providers died. LOT people died overrun. important tourists years Russians hope tourism sector keep coming even know ""you're fib"" supposed mean, course building wall exaggeration. sharing frustration state reasonable restrictions show signs ending matter people cannot here, hop across border spread much want. 
I wear piece cloth help mitigate enormous death suffering happening country, long necessary, even kind annoying. I'm sure became minority sentiment. say like kind hero, really feels like bare minimum decent human commit to. Maybe fewer left thought.  war mongering nation filled racists,homophobes general assholes,this get.The entire part Eastern Europe absolutely despises russians good reason too.




A lot middle east+turkey despise russians good reason too.




Even fucking russians despise russians,chechens also literally disgusted russians,siberian people too. Good question, tend focus negativity. I’ve noticed alot toxic people subreddits. need keep panic porn coming. Mass hysteria sells. That's conspiracy, fact. Media always push narrative deaths, damage, unprecedented events, etc. know kind-of joking, dedicated workspace/home office, take tax deduction costs operating (electricity, internet, rent, etc) essentially percentage regular costs. So, *dedicated* home office takes 10% home's square footage electric suppose water usage, deduct amounts tax.

Source: mostly worked home many years. Note never actually worth deduct home office costs. Cancer kills US EVERY year recent record. New treatments making things bit easier. many tests vs days? asian nations?

Korea tracing system would considered blatant unsustainable privacy violation west.

Taiwan acted incredibly early nowadays sometimes even bother wearing masks community spread non-existent. like Vietnam.

Japan test, plain simple. management far neared Trump levels incompetence.

Nz Australia remote islands end world afford keep borders closed indefinitely quarantine everyone entering, unlike Europe. Australia huge outbreak winter right moving towards warm season. Damn that’s fucked Solid argument. 😂 culture medicine kind providers, acknowledging humans, may also need compassion care. lot Americans seem understand whole point society band together may protect weakest vulnerable, even strongest knows weak vulnerable point.  weakest vulnerable die betrayal fundamental reason society.

You're talking citizens first world country third world healthcare third world welfare, course, acceptable weak vulnerable die here. People think behavior brought COVID paying attention. sort mentally handicapped person? never said anything conspiracy i, saying media uk want lockdown get translated global conspiracy tv ratings? people truly dumb Putin fucking trump, trying make envious. doubt worked. Let’s throw Ron DeSantis UK seven day average: 15,505  Lmfao blow ass Euro trash. A. think we’re getting another 150k deaths year? Wow. What’s next tactic “winter coming” thing doesn’t pan Jan?

B. chances covid death retirement age minuscule (not mention average age covid death average life span US citizen.) 

C. 35k people year die car accidents, that’s terrible - many trips non-essential? ban cars? Limit reasons one drive? allow commercial drivers?

Or continue using necessary part life protect vulnerable (like letting children elderly/infirm licenses)?

I imagine let unlicensed 12 year olds drive, 35k driving deaths would likely escalate, right? mean, lockdown still cases exactly getting top virus... predicted situation would happen 2015 ever since pandemic started right everything.  Give one single reason trust someone dedicated nearly 20 years life dealing infectious diseases global healthcare matters.

Not wrong directly contributed research result vaccine virus.  done pandemic insulting making accusations people simply want held end pandemic little death suffering possible? Nonsense, coronavirus always general population outbreak. Contact tracing fish out, that's does. Nobody cares precious karma. Get yourself. Rats. think high schools colleges closed elementary middle schools. kids need school. daughters elementary school, goes 5 days week. wear mask whole day(besides eat drink), desk 8 foot apart, eat desk, recess gym play social distancing games(like kicking throwing ball back forth), clean hands every hour, buses stagger drop pick up. None issue kids follow rules(she actually used mask forgets take pick up!)She’s back school 8 weeks 0 cases coronavirus I’m Missouri it’s hot spot. think done properly going school fine older kids(highschool college) don’t follow rules honestly online keep home. Don’t punish little kids need school person. Yeah, I'm honestly disgusted shit gets upvoted here.

Covid really brings worst people huh vAcCInE would interesting comparing influenza covid year since old people self isolate previous seasons. bad, meant Italy supposed roll vaccination program April. inherently thought everybody else would start around month half russia belongs european continent. *New Zealand entered chat.*  Thanks Mini-Poot! 40k phase 3 trial. worries, daughter vaccine, good. think it’s virus spreads fast prisons. tons outbreaks across country them. going let say end sentence fucked up. States report CDC. couple weeks White House wanted data first passing CDC. reverted back outrage. Also states rather shady. Florida fired coronavirus data person claims sweeping numbers rug. Lots politics usual process scientific fact based. show. USSR! USSR! USSR! people would actually fucking listen lockdowns would ended months ago.  people fight longer continue assure people going tolerate bullshit people much longer.  Keep pushing start pushing back HARD. could argue never really tbh someone installs great hinges self-releasing latches. Gotta hit SDGs. dropping there. East Asia really well except Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar. Funny countries keep numbers testing much US It’s sending message.  Yeah, China weird one, right?
Market Communism?   True part Russia Europe? Illinois undoubtedly handled better. WI Legislature stands ready strike actions taken Governor, best supreme court money buy back up.

Until gerrrymandering corrected, WI continue see politics ruled ALEC templates WMC. consistent statewide action combat COVID impossible right now. Human rights matter hungary many deaths relatively low daily cases? prominent example turkey, around 60 deaths day onyl 1.500 daily cases, possible? That’s nice. see you’ve never heard moving goalposts. arguing asking - worse winter? Wont people socialize less stay home cause it’s cold? Rookie numbers What's funny family lifelong Democrats. came Obama. wonder problem Obama 🤔 try bullshit March, April, May, June, July August proven wrong again? Yeah, I’m sure they’ll start available April it’ll available Jan/Feb doses continue roll April everyone access it. don’t think they’ll take break delivering doses I’m sure it’s gonna work. Whoa... insane numbers. sue McDonalds made coffee hot.

That woman served coffee like 155 degrees gave third degree burns throughout entire crotch, skin grafts construct parts vagina. ikr, real leader party backyard. Quite point imo, except optimistic willing competent US government handling virus foundation played key role research led covid19 vaccines currently development mention significant work foundation done address spread infectious disease.  Gates know you, actually done something it. 


All need sit shut fuck lives.  one cares ignorant opinions people fucking fed bullshit.

Note mods: care uncivil.  People like one responded literally standing way addressing pandemic ignorance literally killed others.  Want deal incivility? Ban dumbfucks incivility disappear. kids coming home school could problem. smesh raycords?! month, time Cases skyrocketed, test postivity rate approaching 10% early september &lt;2%. varied around mid September schools late September Uni's ""death rate"" I'm assuming talking ""life expectancy."" That's average. Half people live longer life expectancy.

Why covid death higher negative value? covid death lonely death. visitors covid ICU. also painful death. really wanted understand, could look yourself. Winter coming Yes, I've written sounds harsh, true sentiment shared many. 

The matter fact ease restriction people wanted, also would like point live FL want stay lockdown wish ;) Like said - own, can't imagine I'd waste second Disney Florida resident. state literally surrounded beautiful beaches coasts. wife Miami Beach Keys done fair share drinking, trade second time Disney.

I put kids - that's extent it. I'm glad never got theme parks interested travel general seeing new things, spend time I'd ripped hair out. Yeah I’m Xi, confirm this. *YOU GOD DAMN RIGHT.* ""I know talking about. coronavirus surge Russia. say... ehhhhhhh... fake news.""

""What's corpse sheet affixed biohazard symbol it?""

""Oh, nothing. was... ehhhh... cirrhosis liver.""

""Then biohazard sign sheet?""

""That's biohazard sign. is, say...""

""I give up."" might bad idea community transmission, attacking people going. technically possible one goes North Korea, thus way transmission. yes!

 but... money! disagree things said, anyways, political issue. Everyone opinion. party belong entirely defines opinions, even nothing politics, country headed towards ugly place.

In country happened (yet) pandemic, I've seen happening non-political issues. Politicization science prevents rational discussion really good anyone. people Michigan subs saying work sole purpose getting vaccine early. Dunno true not. one consolation least seems like fatality rate much lower (we're getting better treatment, presume?)

I think testing better everywhere, treatment certainly improved, younger people getting places trying get back normal economy. part may simply deaths lagging indicator, situation increasing case numbers take deaths catch up. would like incorporate handwritten experiences

What mean? 
Literally people handwriting things? Sadly, neither anymore. picture. appreciate nice round number, that’s 1000 cases per state per day! weeeeee! Hospitalizations seem stay flat, so... Yeah mean countries like Slovakia Czechia even Germany simply can't keep borders closed vaccine virus eradicated. I'm Bratislava know well much trade work living done across borders. I'm loop (other side planet) genuinely curious. sources coming from? prevent center disease control involved? is, can, provide accurate reports? true good deal. Covid patients spend huge amount time hospital. Decreasing time needd hospitalized decrease resources used per person increase amount people receive treatment. funny mundane words romance language seem cultured English. People stupid. Like, really are. Mostly want told need not-shit life (work hard school/job, obey law, buy right stuff, whatever is). Thinking rare. Thinking beyond rarer still.

Once hospitals start overflowing (and will, nothing changed virus), hammer come people stay home instructed. punishment, it’s necessary moment. Unless you’re fine letting people die completely preventable reason. situation something everyone in, can’t seem see little bit suffering greater good really reason keep explaining you. Look beyond dude. I’m mood subtle. Hydroxychloroquine treatment coronavirus work. beneficial, fact appears actively harmful. 

Derek Lowe ain't fucking around. Russia, cure. got clinic throw roof. There's also chance time herd immunity occurs naturally vaccine, virus could mutate enough able bypass individual's pre-existing immunity. saying that's likely probable, comes viral mutations, there's always chance...

After all, virus' animal borne ancestor mutate enough able jump species, able efficiently spread human human, something SARS 1 good 2003, none past 20 years avian flu scares able accomplish well either...

Nearly 6,000 experts, including dozens UK, say approach devastating impact physical mental health well society.

They calling protection focused vulnerable, healthy people get lives.

The declaration prompted warnings others scientific community.

Critics pointed out:

a targeted approach could make difficult protect vulnerable people entirely
the risk long-term complications coronavirus mean many others also risk
But movement - known Great Barrington Declaration - mirrors warnings letter signed group GPs UK.

Sixty-six GPs, including TV doctors Dr Phil Hammond Dr Rosemary Leonard number medics held senior roles British Medical Association, written health secretary, saying insufficient emphasis ""non-Covid harms"" decision-making.

What Great Barrington Declaration?
The movement started US.

And declaration signed nearly 6,000 scientists medical experts across globe well 50,000 members public.

The UK-based experts signed include:

Dr Sunetra Gupta, epidemiologist Oxford University
Nottingham University self-harm expert Prof Ellen Townsend
Edinburgh University disease modeller Dr Paul McKeigue
They say keeping lockdown policies place vaccine available would cause ""irreparable damage, underprivileged disproportionately harmed"".

The health harms cited include:

lower childhood vaccination rates
worsening care heart disease cancer patients
And point risk coronavirus 1,000 times greater old infirm, children risk flu Covid-19.

As immunity builds population, risk infection - including vulnerable - falls, say.

And would much ""compassionate"" approach.

The declaration recommends number measures protect vulnerable, including regular testing care-home workers, move far possible towards using staff acquired immunity.

Retired people living home groceries essentials delivered, says.

And possible, meet family members outside rather inside.

Simple hygiene measures, hand washing staying home sick, practised everyone.

San Francisco one places handling best, still surprisingly lax attitude masks. maybe 3/4 people walking around crowded areas wearing mask. course nose-out group, loose bandana/fleece group shown lot less effective proper masks.

If enough significantly slow spread here, imagine mask mandate nationwide, proper widespread public health messaging loose bandana nose-out cut anymore, police departments could somehow incentivized give tickets non-compliance. get ticket kinds trivial stuff like jaywalking parking car somewhere little long, world stopping pandemic good enough reason also give tickets?

We could stop covid tracks month, people could visit families again, local businesses would customers.

It's infuriating something simple. (And easy blame Trump, afaik even Biden explicitly said he'd impose national mask mandate, certainly nobody left right talking actually enforcing local mask mandates have). please write Chancellor ask legalize weed?

Edit: Fauci May 2020 United States people walking around masks*  Well Netherlands still hot topic too, head infectious disease institute (Jaap Van Dissel) repeatedly stated scientific evidence wearing non-medical masks help incredibly slim. also stated therefor every decision government makes making masks mandatory certain places political decision scientific one. anything scared wearing non-medical mask give people false sense security causes take rules like social distancing (1,5m) less strict. coming person among knowledgeable virus transmission country think right.

Also went Norway summer found masks really thing either, scientific evidence really there.

Yet go internet see americans going nuts see people shops streets without masks, calling anti science.

Sure. 90% plus infected go without serious symptoms, there's evidence dont' know they've it.

- better treating catching early. 

- testing more, means see cases. 

- Many going die already passed

one thing previously, Europe's ""first wave"" likely way actual people infected saw case counts. Even though *looks* like Spain, example, experiencing surge saw months ago, likely much smaller actual surge back then. daily case counts normalize amount testing done. tested much now, starting march, we'd accurate picture painted. huge problem social security benefits can't afford.... hmmm....

But guess that’s given. They’ve underfunding education decades, what’s point funding properly pandemic safety reasons? They’re hurting kids normal times. Pandemic times another issue don’t want spend money on. Numbers cases Italy already quite high 17 days ago. seeing apocalypse? Yeah, states voted Trump America States voted Clinton US.

Close damn schools NOW.  aunt works Covid unit. single nurse doctor gotten virus despite around covid patients every day. Granted N95 masks, isn’t rocket science. Thankfully, daily deaths consistently (albeit slowly) falling.

They're currently lowest level since first half May. 7-day average according worldometer 609, barely half peak total.

Sao Paulo particular seems improved (perhaps first place hit hard). Deaths lowest level since late April 1/3 peak levels.

Curiously, seem recent evidence undercount excess deaths (although evidence early summer). southern hemisphere seem proper flu season year, perhaps uncounted covid deaths cancelled drop flu deaths? Arizona saw 75% drop COVID-19 cases mask mandate, closures

Watch TED talk topic predicted all. amazing thing modern society SPEAK world class scientists form opinions using theirs... would assume Bill Gates probably afford phone communicate people.

Italy quite fine. think healthcare-deficit collateral deaths follow curve. steadily increase time death 110% baseline indefinitely. going hospital something urgent one thing, seen evidence causing deaths. going hospital (or even dentist) regular updates going add steadily time.

On topic collateral deaths, also know significant *negative* collateral deaths. Fewer car accidents etc. clear number COVID deaths less excess deaths. could easily higher.

This interesting discussion enough data available resolve it. would turn save lives long run due better care.

Also save lives due better understanding disease treatments actually work. many people died April would lived know now? either. Similarly bad.

That's true, people generation talk exactly like that, missing one important detail. compare Soviet Union, 1990s, Russian economy went absolute shit immediately collapse Soviet Union. directly associate ruined economy democracy, thus consider collapse Soviet Union tragedy, want strong Soviet-like leader, Putin gives them. Also, people often nostalgic times young, tend remember good things forget bad things. going defend original point rather deflect argument like kind accustomed doing? points regarding sweden analysis ""the death toll"" people often bring up. 

First, let's establish many countries different ways counting covid-19 mortality. hard find definitive information countries count covid death is, places USA example seem count different ways depending state. Arizona counts covid death may way New York counts one, New York counts one may way Florida France Italy Spain Japan South Korea count one. this, difficult make comparisons going worldometers looking ""covid deaths,"" least opinion. 

Because this, believe insightful look excess cause mortality, adjust population growth, look excess cause death compare the... say, past five ten years mortality country, look countries did. method mortality analysis serves couple things: 

- Get past issue various countries/states different definitions covid death is. 
- provide comparison mortality impacted by, say, decreased mortality previous years (which means would ""dry tinder"" effect, I'll return later) put mortality context previous influenza/epidemic seasons

Though method also must remember saying every excess death ""covid season"" covid death. assumes covid thing killing people average, increases death causes. Another way phrasing would ascribing excess deaths covid related means one believes ""lockdown deaths,"" will. However that's different conversation, back point.

[This handy graphic compares cause mortality SWE January 1st September 27th year 2015-2020, population See source bottom like verify chart yourself. 

Here, observe ""dry tinder"" effect created unusually mild 2019 death season. means tragically lot people who, average, would passed 2019 lived 2020, meaning COVID lot somewhat ""easy targets"" pick off. Even so, population adjusted cause mortality barely higher 2015-2019 average. [Here's version without population growth story short, put things context understand different countries count covid deaths differently. Knowing makes much productive analysis Sweden experience covid. 

Does anyone know similar analyses countries? negative aspects China this?

Im oblivious world works ....

If countries beef it, China tells #&amp;$^$ right?

I mean like there's enough paper bills compensate even goal figure something like that?

I think speculating ""Well people probably already travel across county lines kinds things make difference"" surefire analysis, think pandemic justifying action ""Well right done make big difference too"" good. Two wrongs make right. People travel far wide go amusement parks, designed attract people over. cannot say malls, restaurants, bars. 

You say Disney good enforcing rules, however saw ton videos people Disney without masks yelling medical condition allow wear mask, including mom daughter combo livestreamed without masks, talking daughter felt sick got media attention back.

I still opinion get everything mostly control, nothing unessential opened.

We'll waiting decade another album anyway. plenty recovery time. wish optimism. sort evidence looking for? lockdowns undoubtedly lead deaths (missed cancer screenings, cardiovascular impacts, suicides, etc), doubt comes close number senior citizens we’ve lost covid thus far. you’re expecting “evidence” deaths higher due lockdown don’t think it. 

If look essentially factor focus quality life *living,* becomes different picture. 

I don’t know quantify crash economy, loss jobs livelihood, loss general happiness well population, loss social life, loss normalcy innocence generation kids, etc, etc vs premature death septuagenarian. It’s really hard, it’s discussion needs soon. Pretty much heard friends St Petersburg. Well many German theaters luxury opening limited capacity, making basically profit they’re supported local governments. Also repertoire model allows pick smaller productions already repertoire even change new productions go COVID restrictions. Broadway basically depends profit copyright issues can’t change adapt shows current restrictions. Hospitals 80% filled moment, still reserves
though  Didn’t even try. Technically true. People superspreaders superspreader events anywhere (including schools). believe it’s related phenomenon men requiring directions — whether assemble bicycle Christmas Eve, navigate somewhere they’re lost.

I assume it’s hard-wired. That’s one good thing pandemic. There’s really point working office anymore lot tech jobs. Even winter, COVID stay good. vaccine comes around things return normal, it'll still disease we'll need learn live with. we? depends lot country vulnerable are. Russia China started distributing vaccines without waiting results phase 3 trials. 

However, vaccines approved widespread use. Here’s good tracker. sources claim limited availability end year general availability mid late next year. lowly coffee boy governor New Jersey Schools GA NH open love data. I'm New York they're already starting shut hot spots numbers spiking. I'm next one I'm waiting see long we're effectively rolled back March-April. Sigh. can't people wear masks? thought I'm means expert, perhaps asymptomatic mild infections mimic seasonal allergies go seed communities weeks incubation period up, scores people potentially exposed asymptomatic/ mildly infected start showing symptoms start filling hospitals testing centers quick succession, many others exposed also asymptomatic/ mild infections repeat process elsewhere.

There's going decades study needed fully understand virus operates causes explosive outbreaks- especially densely populated areas, that's two cents.  EU yes, USA point view Russia apocalyptic shithole won’t hurt remind even backwater counties like Russia universal healthcare figured out. Thank much detailed articulate responses. May ask Russia live? far tell, east Russia less western politics affect you. (Although may perspective northeast US)

I know political aspirations, part hopes do. dumpster fire Washington indication, need critically thinking individuals government world like yourself. actually brings another question-there pervasive idea states anyone going Russian politics automatically target head. think accurate? pertain going Putting? There's something called ""excess death rate."" Basically good statistical models many people likely die given period time. know many people fact died period time, significant difference highly likely due exogenous shock. Usually, takes form spike ""excess deaths"" (actual deaths statistical prediction) due disaster. case COVID, barring secondary disaster kills lot people (like major, major earthquake second major outbreak disease), excess deaths correlate well uncounted COVID deaths. Since COVID measures appear sharply reducing deaths non-COVID disease--such seasonal flu--simply adding excess deaths official tally may still undercount, lot closer ""official"" tally lot places. Wait minute, painkiller  It’s insane upvotes. vaccine expected 70% efficacious Fauci, would end pandemic. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* live, certain class person INSISTING above, rather told it. heard latest plenty times, suit desires. agreed! total numbers, represents larger sample paints better picture.

 I'm sure there's ""best way"", use I'm used represents country handling pandemic. I'm calculating trusting Coronavirus app. fairly accurate since beginning, noticed errors calculations.

Why 100k better 1 million entire country? FHM predicted likely scenario would sharp peak autumn, multiple local outbreaks, followed quick decrease another Sweden's fault we're weaponized used example multiple sides domestic political discourse countries. good friend St Pete cancer must use public transport get chemo twice per week. Normal masks protect much help others. Nobody wearing unaware risk (a western disease). friend terrified her. like reading arrest report feel better yourself. getting arrested every week mean great life. 

In area, elementary schools opened middle/high schools hybrid schedule. get around 0-10 cases day now. everywhere America same. economy joke though. many people actually overweight? Jeez I’m sorry live nyc everything said completely false “They” can. “We” can’t. I'm definitely irritable usual year! Thanks classy it. Hope get good news soon. Hang there. going happen, lockdown. can't it. Infections city doubling almost every 10 days cannot even DARE talk closing bars pubs, let alone locking anything. Nah, pay pump here, purell car, drive throughs stuff, appreciate concern, people it, honestly, here's hoping come back bite me.. think we're careful, especially go re-opening pubs, drunk people surely trusted distance, could go wrong? Carmen Sandiego, you?? Muslims Sikhs Jesus freak party problem lockdown fatigue though makes people dumb shit, break rules desperation, frustration boredom. Then, shit restarts get clusters, extending lockdown.

Rinse repeat.   flip side, feel job risk company local talent benefit anymore.  Source? states US mandates masks large fine moment. take NYC example. 

NYC relatively fine city half empty, nightlife basically non existent there's still plenty restrictions. cases still creeping up.

Italy face mask mandate ages. Even summer less 200 cases day rare see people without masks public transport inside shops. fine couple weeks ago. exploded - still wearing masks. Spain also mask mandates since July, Belgium since August. exploding. likely gonna happen NYC way. massively simplifying highly complex issue. Thats antisocial, can’t add whatever want word say true. said people actually enjoy’d hiding emotions people, definitely fits antisocial umbrella. don’t account reduced mortality caused fewer traffic accidents, increased mortality caused deferring non-emergency medical care. manifest several years still. Women red badass style 

Love Father cannot outdone son  12,000? That’s rookie shit. Florida alone putting numbers like months ago. miss early days outbreak felt like everyone together. feels like separated, partly arent supposed interact much. partly feels like US laughing stock whole world. Especially since president carrot. Keep waiting. happen day now..right, kiddo? close vaccine approved distributed general public? population Cook county nearly double population city - hard hit city was. 

There's pretty clear case prior infections slowing transmission rate (aka herd immunity effects), given far half cases Cook county coming less half population, specifically portion infected earlier. Closed Quebec house gatherings permitted. ever go school? Bubonic plague caused bacteria. A. It’s virus. B. wasn’t novel either, also occurred least early 6th century.

You can’t make comparison Covid plague. single year half Italy’s population dead, despite attempted interventions like quarantine, term originated. Italy, also hit hard pandemic lost 0.006% population. There’s comparison. actually saw drop heart attack stroke deaths time places COVID, though. Lockdowns lead negative excess deaths covid.

Deaths diagnosed Alzheimer's exactly ones likely due COVID. single highest co-morbidity. Alzheimer's ultimately fatal regardless eventually, perhaps deaths ignored completely. tools that.

The largest number excess deaths US, last checked, due Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease. likely COVID-caused. know talking about. job market absolutely stronger utah california. make 10k job California would make utah. states didnt allow restaurants operate period time. didn’t work. **That's** Carmen Sandiego is! honestly trouble finding date thanks modern internet news intentionally omits dates, still (especially without date) I'd say *ARE* encouraging.  even limiting restaurants... know he's complaining death rate... change one line code covid5G liberal mind controller program would go back down. actually heard original virus came attached one Hillary's emails Bill Gates allowed it. Lock up, lock up, lock up!! Without wishing start WW3, billion people aren’t American planet, 100milion doses doesn’t go far. going countries multiple layovers, partying there, coming back partying, going cinemas, going bars restaurants together 50 people, meeting many family members friends possibly meet, dangling mask around neck even wearing one work. could've guessed? doubt. think we're agreeing France trouble here. April NYC exactly goal strive toward. Killing restaurant sector sounds like even worse idea. Hope asymptomatic carrier gave gas station clerks corona!

Hope pick corona recent one! Keep mind, covid patients prolonged suffering die isolation. 

What shitty way die. denying general, people think may virus likely jump bunch hoops see people reason think did?

This basic stuff terms designing scientific studies. feel researchers GOOD ways right now, come on, man, know there's selection bias here. definitely cases per capita. Russia barely tests oligarchy interest showing people bad leading country. European country far, think. 

Would equate roughly 100k US, comparison. really, tests slightly increased % positive tests climbing day. Median age also increasing, means virus slowly spreading elderly, always does.

Deaths still low, there's time lag case deaths. going though. state controlled media dictator? *more* testing? literally huge testing shortage. think key distinction two sources come scientists/medical professionals. comes political leader. unknown long term health implications...? Long Covid thing. logical ground extremist statements like ""the vaccine come late"" ""cause world economy collapse"".

Well, could tell came conclusion. based lot factors. would read everything? Probably not. do, would understand everything? Probably not. do, would admit bad situation is? Probably not, would shatter worldview. want feel good, want feel safe, want believe everything control soon, everything going back normal. Like majority population. continue spread virus more. Things develop matter anyone says. virus care point adding problem. exactly kinds alarmist exaggerated statements make covid-deniers take risks seriously.

Nope. even weak correlation people like people take Covid seriously. responsible lack intellectual capabilities. responsible lack knowledge. responsible selfishness. responsible denial. slightest. unpopular opinion like Puscifer way better Tool. It’s accessible. Like what? Spanish numbers strangest Europe since start pandemic though. Even dead tools difference compared average last years one biggest."
