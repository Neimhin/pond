Unfortunately, people barely hanging on, winter coming. Donate local food banks can! people relying it. Things kept afloat expectation shit hits fan, fan tier powers used keep things afloat. govt keep asset prices high likes purchasing them, keep food table long agriculture continues working, roofs already built continue provide shelter.

The resources there, accounting made check out, there's general expectation made continue function. that's shown false, mass delusion revealed, could expect collapse. question is, govt stop it? January. briefing found end January. Oh man, see someone take mask Kroger sneeze. forgot that. Ridiculous. think point mask is?? Blame democrats intentionally filling bill pork would way possibly passing it.. Trump played right hands mopes like would blame him.. ""It is.""

     - Donald Trump fairness foreign brown people count less them.  Hooray human beings suffering! /s It’s always hard know sure, statement, Coast Guard public affairs director Rear Adm. John Hickey said Ray attended event Gold Star families White House Sunday, Sept. 27. one day White House held event Rose Garden nomination Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court justice, multiple attendees tested positive COVID-19. company work pandemic response books years case. Along standard natural disaster responses. first time they’ve use I’m thankful ahead curve everything asshole ever says invalid due prior conduct, everyone stay jail forever? guy seems like ass, I've seen nothing make think he's bad person Trump. So, criticizing Trump bother all. BLM literally ""By going large gatherings social distancing killing people""

We already evidence low outdoor spread time protests happened, one wanted come high horse. People still harping beachgoers Christ's sake! wouldn’t surprised. bad bois slipped mind sorry Im huge fan KF94 masks. fit amazing. wear 8 hour shifts aren’t uncomfortable. filter 94%, respirators. studied scientists effective. go. Find way attend virtually possible. decide go, please wear mask keep distance possible. Try congregate many attendees time.  No, I'm weirdo. I'm realist. We're still almost 1000 deaths day, cdc expecting another 200k dead end year. thinks going happen cases explode winter? ICUs fill up. Even treatments, still gotta beds. Scientists believe 10% world this, even factor 3, that's 30%. Herd immuntiy would 70,80% virus. Maybe people took seriously, instead calling us weirdos, position. funny actually remember this. want go concerts festivals again. going 20-50 events year since 2007 far past new years eve last show attended. Fuck waiting another year shows. 

 Also music artists supposed making living income comes performing shows?  Yes, ignorant anti-progressive nationalists fault here. right.

Fuck GOP. Interesting. introvert, anguish mentally come experiencing and/or interacting people can't follow basic protocols like proper mask wearing.

Honestly, I've pretty content limited virtual hangs friends come loathe human interaction even due negative interactions go out. I'm looking forward return workplace future might actively seek ways make remote work permanent. gave tweets attention I'd picking fights man wonder really worse usual behavior? Don’t confront people. 

I know it’s tempting angering, know people don’t care anyone themselves. correct?

I thought President could sued things OFFICE. New York tax cases already audit (according Trump) years ran office.

He said could release tax returns audited. Woah! dad’s janitor there! Homage FDA ""career scientists""  thing hate covid potential long term effects. asymptomatic. one else got around great it’s month since tested positive. However acute pains left side chest near heart. Haven’t checked back yet scary. wonder outcome gonna turns like flu keeps circulating around. catch multiple times potential long term damage? It’s similar flu also different something need take serious. feet insertion ass thing? good part country gone insane

Not mentioning names, 94% approval rating amongst republicans last Gallup poll. dispel notion Trump doesn’t know he’s doing? Oh...no he’s got fucking clue he’s doing. I’ll bunker. Would neurological symptoms lead person hypothetically something like cease relief plan negotiations scuttle market? Even I'm bit frustrated masks. would imagine six months people stop caring masks whole. could spin saying flu history killed Covid, don’t think that’s saying. Also it’s bad argument Trump Fox News keep blaming Pelosi, that's why. Trump tweet announcing said gave 'very generous offer' $1.6 trillion stimulus Pelosi said (even though Democrats $2.2 trillion already passed House, ready go). therefore blame it, Republicans refusing agree $2.2 trillion already passed House.

He also says there's money fund evil Democratic state governments, money nothing Covid (even though they're totally financial trouble thanks Covid). that's Republicans need keep saying them.

Here's article detailing NYC's tax revenues affected Covid year (chart near bottom article). They're $2.4 billion sales tax alone (down Absolutely biden gained several percent polls last debate. there's literally nothing gain debating again, except covid, obviously helpful chances winning. Wait long enough it’s late Dems contest, early enough get bump polls. claim virus real clearly people sadly died it, end day stats numbers page. double suits them. defending guy seem like thing. Getting state one thing, knowing another. probably would surprised parks closed, seem open places since outdoors. technically academic however read many research papers raisingvthecalarm concern research... would amazing could link can’t find it.

But it’s weird even *you* provided different number OP, still idea he/she got “.13” from

Edit: I’m finding .65, significantly higher OP stated

Double edit: numbers gave don’t make sense either. vulnerable group IFR 0.054% you’re defending OP claiming average .13%? vulnerable group lower IFR average? FiveThirtyEight say fair election, he'd win 1 6.

So he's good chance still.  treatment multiple O2 level drops things would suggest lot closer severe mild. would suggest, currently believe accurate, wait 20 days coming quarantine. 

Probably already exposed couple dozen people since he's out. 675,000 Americans Spanish flu users sub live Guangdong could answer better me, AFAIK like this:

Travelling Hong Kong China like entering China foreign country, need undergo 14 day mandatory quarantine.

However, unlike situation countries Hong Kong there's list exceptions rule. example truck drivers delivery supplies mainland China Hong Kong exempt, I'm sure many exceptions.

I'm sure situation Hong Kong side. that, never shut / social distanced / wore masks last 5 flu seasons. Ive never changed habits flu. Like COVID completely different beast. Says person afraid .6% mortality rate Exactly! That’s basically cognitive behavioral therapy works. roid rage nuclear football bad combination challenge anyone tell makes ""high scientific standards"".

*""Wait couple months make sure least 5 severe cases there""* high standards, based identifiable science

Is vaccine protects two months significantly likely protect longer one protects one? vaccine prevented 5 severe cases expected provide protection statistically significantly way? right. Holy shit downvotes though trash. Food shortages, infrastructure failures, increasing violence, economic collapse, frequent natural disasters, war, different fucking disease. Plenty options pick from... course ! Thank you. Latest stats front page last time checked. Infection fatality ratio ages lowest risk age group, 0-19, tops .00003% (only .00003% people within age bracket confirmed infected die) highest risk age group, 70+, tops .054%.

The numbers support mandates. It’s indictment America compliment anything Trump. Even test negative still quarantine based CDC website.  Testing mentioned article.  Comparison bad, I'll give more. 


""Cigarette smoking responsible than 480,000 deaths per year United States, including than 41,000 deaths resulting secondhand smoke exposure.""


""Excessive alcohol use responsible 95,000 deaths the United States each year, ""


Meanwhile walk nearby store pick pack smokes 6 pack. 


Back war comparison. US sent troops fight conflict. People volunteered country drafted. brutality killed. 


The avg age killed US soldier Vietnam 22 years old. average age US killed Afghanistan 29. deaths tragic lost lot years fighting wars. 


The average age covid deaths US higher avg. life expectancy US. 


With said, death horrible avoid deaths costs matter age cause death. Making comparisons help.


Wear damn mask, keep clean, avoid unnecessary contact other, keep distance. Trump said got Corona best treatment world, ""We together."" never will. bungles, still 40% support. Trump cronies symptom. America eating alive. google anything lot results. kind search engines do.  Piece shit  Lmao. downvotes hilarious though. ""Vote"" thinly veiled.  charged spreading virus too. knows many people he's responsible killing. forget, care plebs. Pretty ironic, whole subreddit pretty much political sub. lie yourself, bot. Get self-awareness. sort person genuinely tell someone ""Don't sad, people worse do""? also people Trump selected... Tax fraud, I’m guessing. value public health all, recognize absolute necessity get vaccine right. People US already (shamefully, stupidly) skeptical vaccines. salute FDA taking time make sure done right, rather throwing rush job pretending great. Trump building we're making, all. 99.94% chance surviving covid you’re ages 18-39. child’s percentage even lower. Go outside enjoy life    vaccine flu

A policy lot Trump's base supports well forget taking much measurements precautions COVID. lock street mandate mask flu. Maybe everyone senses we're turn corner, here. idea people dependent Medicare Medicaid states refusing hand data put pressure elected officials stop screwing around health (both directly indirectly) comply federal requirements? much confidence states department health human services reporting accurate numbers, seem like could effective way increase compliance (at cost human suffering, never problem administration).  

Hypothetically, even HHS nothing best intentions action taken hospitals non-compliance could impact ability provide care, appreciate hard come penalty severe enough incentivize hospitals follow rules harsh causes suffering loss critical data would cause. somehow doubt they've managed find one case though. Bad Man Orange! imagine president decided withhold stimulus talks passing bill needed due unexpected time could try hold hostage voting him... Lol sorry mate clearly wrong. Japan handed Taiwan back China lost war, reasons gave many places. US nothing Chinese territories already taken Japan parts Korea. KMT basically annexed Taiwan own. feel to. don’t local friends moved new area. long time since lonely honestly winter worries me. can’t get mental health providers call back think it’s going get ugly it’s dark cold day I’m apartment alone days time. know one special kind stupid Frankly Scarlet, give damn ! one could’ve predicted this.  Seems Covid probably still bit worse. Flu vaccines always effective, numbers still get high. Although part could know better treat flu, even vaccine stop it, maybe would similar.

Vaccine effectiveness place flu. following link CDC estimating effective vaccines year back 2004. low 10% high right things COVID

pretty sure Chinese lot deaths too, stopped releasing data focus shifted away China Italy back spring “If people could read would upset” saying big ticket item akin sports car completely wrong. myth south rich ones slaves complete rewriting history sorry ignorant. people get infected within past three days? _lot_ people. since March event unfold took 7 months hit administration. now? current administration: 215,000 deaths nbd.

Hitler fucks covid way Lincoln freed lot slaves u bro Again, bullshit. Fuck ccp looking post history see I've said many times. defended facts, see defending ccp maybe consider looking things.

The rest post drivel, clearly pay attention measures China undertook contain virus, absolutely make go away lockdown hard tight. evidence points completely controlled China zero evidence contrary yet refuse accept that, nerve say understand science. Obesity kills 300,000 Americans year.

That's 100 9/11s every year. 2.8 Million deaths every year causes, put perspective. Wearing masks/gloves, washing hands, distancing, taking unnecessary risks, etc. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article stupid comparisons, fuck Trump’s empty rhetoric.

A viral pandemic nothing common analogies - it’s highly communicable public health hazard. choose smoke drink go war. can’t choose get sick, bunch *fucking morons* around taking seriously, Trump spread nonstop misinformation six months.

But love subtle little attempt reversal here, acting like Trump kind uniting leader, cabal anti-science lunatics suddenly *real concerned* COVID safety. Give fucking break.

Also, daily reminder pandemic scenarios *preventable crises* competent leadership strong institutions. let rhetoric like rewrite situation here.  RACIST LIVES MATTER want accuracy, secession treason.

IYKYK What? dangers death count literally ever corner news. country locked want? Lock starve death? Lockdowns useless testing slow, contact tracing non-existent 25-75% population refuses participate.

So, state mess leadership level leaders people elected govern prevent governing, correct lockdowns useless.

With real governor local national party undercutting efforts governor, 2 3 week lockdown stops spread enough masks rest 90% area returns normal....provided prevent residents states bad governor's coming state reintroduce infection.    interesting reads would recommend this? he'll make second term

the chance USA vs Iran almost 100% happens flu kills 60,000 year USA. Every single year.

Obesity kills 300,000 year.

So comparisons dumb. call bad war comparison people chose join war, bring even voluntary cigarette habit? ceased Americans pledged loyalty nation open warfare America. responding thread?.... yeah you’re benefiting lol. idiot. 675,000 1918 Spanish Flu That's counted hospitalised example.

Half hospitalised ongoing symptoms seems reasonable. far, plenty reports stating quite high numbers various symptoms including critical stuff like heart brain. Heart issues could easily force career change. could brain. probably can't work factory heart issues, unlikely remain 'knowledge worker' ongoing brain fog.

Reality is, flat know magnitude. know likely effects. almighty economy going take ongoing hit. know long bad. Unfortunately, checking Trump’s Twitter lot past years, seems normal. extremely abnormal thing hospital didn’t tweet (only pre recorded video). 

Today, seems he’s trying backtrack heavily saying withhold stimulus bill wins. is. Yeah. gonna say. There's way correct. 'elect get money'
 
Not really complicated. He's counting people desperate enough vote thinking get check Biden wins. 200k diabetes. saying Also keep mind two numbers calculated way. 

That's confirmed COVID-19 deaths vs. CDC's algorithm likely flu deaths.

If someone died pneumonia March, get test, counted among COVID dead, even real cause death.

Secondhand smoke great example, passed loads legislation making illegal expose others smoke. 

Its kinda sad say studies linking smoking lung cancer came today instead 60 years ago feel like would constant downplaying calling fake news calling universities studies biased. doubt kind legislation would ever get passed today. No. already reported weekend backlog Monday. happens ask volunteers instead hiring contact tracers doctors.

I'm sure get blamed low mask use that's really case. Mask use 90%. result bad strategy central goverment (we opened tourism we're dependent people come pandemic getting worse country) especially regional goverments (the leader autonomous community Madrid said public thought pandemic would summer. I'm guessing that's hire contact tracers like promised would open region back June). That’s big nope. Interesting news recently though, old folks actually breaking Biden. He’s got double-digit lead population actually reliably votes every election. that’s glimmer hope.  way covid burning upper echelon GOP right might well change soon. threads subreddit pretty wild China building two relief hospitals.

you benefit can't afford buy factories produce, fool ‘Donald Trump Killed Americans Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan World War Combined’ case uncertainty COVID deadly people chronic hives? Hives come overreacting immune system right? That's right. Fuck 'em 

/s  less year. Antifa can't get infected grandma's basement. Exactly. destroyed idea together, evidently people equal others.

At least sense national unity awesome months lasted. Excess deaths single coronavirus deaths, looks bigger picture compared earlier years. US almost 300k excess deaths thus far year. Yes, indicator mortal case. seems like sort Black mail.. VOTE get second stimulus Deaths irrelevant proper perspective. literally comparing world 100 years ago. People died stomach bugs back easily preventable today. People die lot car accidents wars. comparisons meaningless, especially they're twisted proportion like OP doing.

You put thing proportion maintain real meaning, like deaths per million. look covid deaths per million Spain especially Belgium much worse US. Every year USA Long Term Care Facilities, 300,000 Deaths Senior Citizens due Infections Coronavirus.

This Senior Citizens make majority COVID19 deaths. 

No wonder insurance companies sell Long Term Care plans. We've since February probably continue foreseeable future. Happy acknowledge fomite transmission unlikely going stop anytime soon. asked low T’s oxygen got, doctor said “Never low 80s.” 

That tells plainly certainly least degrees 90, indicating serious lung involvement serious Covid infection. Everyone sleeping long-term effects Michigan-Ohio war. now. articles posted year along articles later ""New Zealand 4 new cases..."" need murican math.. many American football fields cover? Hold watery beer.  mention flu way denying virus.

I'm saying simply spreading fear.

But take look flu numbers, simply flu way less reach / infections covid.

That's makes rona scary take look relative ratio see death ratio still small.  deserves demon sperm doctor much respect for. Even best vaccine measles 98% effective.

the minmum acceptable vaccine 50% effective means half still get it.

If vaccine first 75% effective 25% still get it.

Then find long vaccination takes reach effectiveness (flu takes couple weeks two months depending article read). 

Then find long *stays* effective. Antiboidies las long, immune clls still help certain period time enough prevent severe cases?

then iwth health problems makes risky get vaccinated fault deserve die would act human kindness wear masks longer least stores protect them. many health conditions low income &amp; can't pay groceries delivered computer even pay extra pick even stores offer especially start shortages panic buying interruptions supply chain due outbreaks. Yes, that's correct believe three nations actual paperwork. could wrong. US 3x many people today interconnected ever... testament shit general health healthcare America. tests, real death number could hundreds thousands. Japan sitting 12 deaths/million. Maybe less asymptomatic testing taking place? Could number things, they've less affected almost anywhere else world despite oldest population.  won't, would let numbers turning reality deal you. fine, allow people eat inside even outside. People sit close, much risk infection. Pretty sure 200,000 americans died ww 1. sub-headline, obviously tried using headline get maximum clicks. scientists disputing calls, claiming herd immunity ""very unlikely"" COVID-19 vaccine found. fuck gave wholesome award Guys, guys, didn’t ya hear president tell us there’s nothing fear it’s far less lethal flu? /s New new new new world order! bad bot Anyone dealt narcissist knows never hope. It’ll never happen. It’s easier cut move life rather keep hurting waiting feel empathy, emotion literally incapable of. brain wired right. majority people live past average life expectancy. They're Iraqis. Call Iraqis. Middle Easterners. delete internet


I'm defending idea guy charged appropriately anymore, loved comment, might use one future. third highest deaths per day adjusted population. North Dakota worst Arkansas second worst. think back least, Wales considered part kingdom England, Act Union England Scotland only. can’t leave covid cdc didn’t. counting covid. That’s numbers higher. People die covid pneumonia statistic covid category also people died pneumonia covid statistic pneumonia w/or w/out covid category. *Trump Sounds kinda fashy. Psycho. best Reddit comment I’ve ever seen. Lol sure: couldn’t tell? sarcastic! Einstein supposedly said ""Two things infinite: universe human stupidity; I’m sure universe!"" sad thing acts like year round, wonder people even noticing it. noticed choices he's making recently completely trashing campaign. couldn’t give less shit masks, I’ve worn work years. take issue people thinking .06% population dying big deal. Cancer heart disease triple there’s nearly much racket those. Nana one many happy meals one bats eye, gets COVID it’s national tragedy even though she’d face fate caught cold. sucks vaccine can’t come quick enough, I’m 20’s pay checks little lighter rest life grimes fuckers couldn’t wash hands. would probably cry like baby force fed shrooms. medical profession helping all. people need take responsibility health. Wow, that’s unbelievable. mean literally. don’t believe it. u/AmputatorBot Also age strongest risk factor far. Nothing else even close. Risk really starts take 45-55 mark obviously highest 80+ group schooool? latter exposed Joint Chiefs, quarantined &amp; hopefully getting lessons use Zoom case need 😜

... can’t believe security isn’t better. Aren’t high-risk Covid? Really extremely bad comparison. you’re gonna carry water racists traitors, least better job Sadly, seem millions people continue thinking like hospitalizes someone family they'd probably say ""being poisoned attempt bump numbers"". Honestly, think that’s conservative figure. admits husband big coronavirus cynics morning August 31, raced home Ma’alot-Tarshiha hospital. don’t know became infected.

Uh maybe laughing science making fun people wearing masks pandemic? wild guess part. said attempt putting numbers perspective. made point validity comparsion.

But personal opinion, general good put huge numbers anything perspective - even though, case, comparison might perfectly valid take population growth account. keep mind matter time - people suddenly stop dying covid19 - population growth would accounted for. regard, comparison still value - even accurate. still let's people grasp order magnitude deaths. good point, probably closer 99.99% actually. Definitely 99%+. exactly happened Belgium. like switch flipped. protests cause new outbreak, also planted seed rules selective overblown.

That's started. never stopped, I'm pretty sure deniers used collective shock take spotlight. every article tweet virologist nurse claiming need something, one ""dissident medical doctor"" telling us everything fine. social media (Twitter 95% denier) regular old mass media.

In meantime, anti-corona camp longer compelling message. went lockdown idea would followed rules. meantime, learned media vaccine best 50% effective, 20% population take it, US going approve unsafe vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine dangerous causes spine inflammation (thanks clickbait media coverage), herd immunity requires 70% vaccinated, due previous, never happen.

Then virologists said new normal throughout 2021 beyond, officially turned light end tunnel.

So people think hope plan, might well choose believe claim nothing wrong lied to, alternative dreadful contemplate.

It help left wing mayor Brussels approved BLM protests also allowed second wave Brussels get control right wing mayor Antwerp locked much earlier. feeling mayor Brussels toothless impose measures immigrant population, leads talk no-go zones, sharia law, replacement theory, cultural warfare etc. votes far right. government left wing population minority government Flanders, significant portion population actively want fail.

Because this, response new measures government ranges ""I'm following [measure] [other group] whatever want [opposite political side] favours them"" (a clear holdover BLM protests) ""stop hoax"" (supported several papers, medical professionals social media).

Since one listens anything government says point, situation continue deteriorate lockdown imposed _and_ enforced across board. lockdown enforcement, groups continue ignore everyone else watches economy collapse, violence. CDC figures set weekly excess deaths zero initial calculation negative, account point made. Gov. Noem correct. Americans poorly behaved look excuse something ""essential"" including running Starbucks latte. STFH. Bishops Poland: wait reach Civil War. Trump still pat back.  knows many days without mask. many people don’t realize infecting others get symptoms. feel bad them, part can’t help think public safer since take seriously. cost may life lives exposed. pandemic revealed actually two viruses play. One covid virus, one imo much virulent, virus mind evidently makes half world population believe completely bonkers conspiracy theories. wish truth would come would held accountable way. might one wish it!!

(I ransack sub yesterday looking it) Meanwhile bishops: look total deaths, deaths incurred spring still dominate picture.

Then next stores restaurants remained open, many Swedes stayed home, rates similar European neighbors, surveys mobile phone data suggest

Maybe recommendations worked like thought would factors ""no lockdown, sweden herd paying immediate price illness, country could achieve “herd immunity” put pandemic behind it

This basically fold, let's stop there. conversation here: really bad flu, people saying first emerged. we're entire country running scared kitten casting shadow lion unfortunate lighting."" see correlation Christ's character Trump's. 

You see good any. one tiny little bit. person shit cardboard box Meijer wear mask? one puzzling things I've ever encountered. only, pointed out, behaviour exact opposite Christian behaviour, alleged affiliation obviously fake, see straight it? chunk voters easily gets corner basic conman game False equivalency. government could prevented deaths. r/ihavesex Google Dr. Jon Tallinger blame caring refuse facts put everyone else risk **cannot** vaccinated? people immunocormpised, allergic reactions. Would consider wearing mask shopping longer protect people like would love vaccinated can't risk it? kickbacks? sign up? comeback would line ""You obliged dress demand want so"" yeah, bother. CHINNA!!!! Tots chairs, whatever. 12 deaths country 200 million hardly surge. Imagine US 20 deaths day believe uncivil telling peopel beat spouses blame quarantine it? 

It seems like honest assesment situaiton regard, not? Facebook reported article: [Baby Dies Birth Defect negative side effects could things like severe heart, lung, brain damage. High standards vigorous testing extremely important.

Think thalidomide drug. thought safe, much approved wide spread use Europe. came babies born missing limbs. High FDA standards stopped drug released US. 

Everyone eager vaccine, including everyone working FDA. Risks vs benefits constantly weighed up, including side effects vaccines vs side effects disease guess biggest flaw models expect people take virus seriously use proven safety measures mitigate spread virus. Phoenix Pod Rave coming next weekend! person quote Tucker Carlson arguement yesterday average age covid death 78. average life expectancy 78! totally neglects fact many young people die. name 10 people knew died 30 fights, drugs, accidents. name quite almost 10 died age 45 less drugs. lot times get age 75, live longer. see point. flu killing &lt;1/3 covid already killed seems support original point. Obesity huge fucking problem also really know coming from. mean, many countries Europe locked done worse. Belgium, Spain, UK etc? next sentence even doctors insisted wearing mask work reprimanded even fired.

That seems absurd. I've tried google can't find articles relating this. They've 24/7 almost 5 months. look stupid use capitalisation 'make argument'. Sorry. CDC. Say goodbye life know it. need mandatory lockdown. need mandatory masks. need vote Big Joe happens dead hard time believing masked indoor birthday parties level complaiance. hard kids wear masks run around. Also, cake? idea fully masked events reality.  I’m saying actually don’t know effects are. Young people dying yeah. Old people dying yeah. nobody knows what’s gonna happen ten years now. 

My suspicion generation college students going covid parties right suffer kind permanent mental impairment. fair, even wasn’t president he’d still tweeting Fox News/tea party types would still taking gospel. Remember Obama birth certificate nonsense Trump started like decade ago?  He’s tweeting pretty positive things. darkly wondering uploaded consciousness cloud. Even COVID, changes absolutely nothing you. would stopped infectious 2 weeks ago, need quarantine. therapeutics would give case like yours, meds they'll receive treat symptoms. looking reasons COVID, likelihood, don't. reasonable. No, I’m saying classic Omni response. presented information suggests eating less meat would better, necessary, public health entire world, get angry “vegans” letting eat want. maybe pandemic? agree caption number deaths/day peaked even southern states, less 500-600 per day average now, follow statistics daily. called infection numbers irrelevant always been. opiates “So here?”

LMAO.

Thats true. Honestly everyone obsessed going restaurant?

I’m buying puts Even stopped pollution second, nothing would improve many many decades. mean can't improve things future generations things take time. Omni response tho

Is meant insulting? should, yes. state isn’t requiring show recent test. believe even get tested airport. arguing one way other, providing source fact checked original question. knew answer already would reason ask worst case scenario back February 2.2 million deaths US. Sadly we’re already past 200k 2 million go catch forecast. 1,000 deaths per day, would take 2,000 days reach that. That’s almost 5.5 years. 

I’m way defending US response thing, least federal response, think state handled reasonably well. think federal response fucking circus. 

I’m also trying downplay 210k US deaths. best friend’s dad died this. virus fucking terrible nothing pisses people pretend it’s big deal. said, think reason hopeful future.

My reasons hopeful:
- elections coming up, opportunity change course
- vaccine development, think safe effective vaccine approved end year distributed next fall
- treatments, course still progress made, we’ve come long way treating disease least hospitalized patients. protocol throw someone ventilator quickly. think need next treatment given home, early disease (I believe they’re currently testing remdesivir inhaler sort)

Like Fauci said, need hunker fall/winter north. Also, rapid, at-home test would absolutely game changing mean like right now? Ex. Wagyu basing seriously take virus badly affects fat fuck. 

If makes alive, literally flu. Would wanted martial law? ICE ghoulish horrible institution dissolved regardless president operate Saying won’t “shed tear” something personally don’t like lot people obviously bit heartless. lived NJ good chunk Christies' tenure. never smartest cookie certainly never one would ever used terms ""level-headed"" ""forward thinking"" describe. H1N1 potential pandemic threat

H1N1 1918 flu killed tens millions. Adjust world population Covid kill 15 times many people far match that. 

Hindsight's 20/20 hard see vax rushed.  hmmm...

Nope head monster.

The ""monster"" exists he's Majority Leader. He's powerless without race affects entire country.

No Senate races. McConnell flush dark money donors

You know like (i work business), past certain point money stops anything you. KY expensive media markets, 20-30 mil Senate race. McGrath approaching 100 million money raised + PAC cash + outside spending. Stop telling people ignore race.

I since telling people keep donating race like lighting money fire, :

1. got enough money three cycles

2. flip seat even give half billion Zoom debate mute buttons. technology. It’s brainer. sure keep referring military members ""soldiers""?

The numbers reporting also includes airman, sailors, marines, coasties. weasel phrasing really got stop comes COVID: ""with known pre-existing health issues *apart from*..."" 

COVID minimize makes us vulnerable it; language ought minimize vulnerabilities either.

It needs 'comorbid high blood pressure' folks might stop saying, ""I'm perfectly healthy fine catch it."" singled old people initially suddenly changed tone everyone vulnerable.

As said, people vulnerable severe effects others. think Newsom implying put mask back get table. literally take mask eating bite food ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. Except comes climate change pandemic risk, it’s everyone’s health. Classic Omni response tho Trump getting ass kicked election *only* thing stop racist resurgence. 

The ugly joke Trump always ""he said quiet part loud."" open racism hearts racists, holds Republicans hostage it. lose election, whether dying covid votes counted winning it, racism open stance Republican party become fascist. loses becomes cautionary tale. Racists hit ""we badly outnumbered civilized people"" go back listening dog whistles bemoaning somehow lazy stealing jobs them. whole household got Covid. made quick recovery. little symptoms. Felt tired it. way frightened prior getting it. partially blame media using common sense science. ????? first responders getting vaccine late February; earliest.

this would include dismantling fda.

fda approved mid-march. LOL joke? can’t honestly trying carry idiotic “dementia” narrative insane shit saw Donnie past couple weeks (to say nothing four years). **""total""** death rate. keep talking total numbers talking recent numbers. talking deaths, talking cases Denmark too. FOX News yells every night. Yes, I’m trying switch local farms, 10$ pound vs 2$ pound quite dramatic feeding family 4. states right succeed own, therefore SC still Union, Union soldiers lawfully. Confederates band illegal terrorists like al-Qaeda. fact wanted leave union passed resolution relevant gang terrorists announcing subject laws country in.

No person supports law order consideres patriot USA consider Confederates anything treasonous terrorists.  Anyone flying Confederate flag identifying un-American terrorist supports treason. That's impossible mentality citizens, face reality accept would happened anyone is. I’m naive. Quite opposite actually. Nobody knows long term effects virus are. all. don’t get it. people

Educated smart.

they good remembering things read/learned repeating.

I saw doctors said coronavirus real bad. Yawn. 

 love many people trying bring history pretend personally offended. /s

This reeks virtue signaling. Boomer things someone computer engineer lack critical thinking skils, realize deadly virus real politics. cheers mate! be, kindergarten level stuff... Chinese, think collectivism influence, importantly pragmatism (collectivist Russia exists too)

Deng Xiaoping said, ""No matter whether black white, cat catches rat good one.""

When confronted COVID-19, Chinese used every available method, loopholes pointed put microscope people, government follow solutions drowned people's opinion

Whatever solution, try say it, solves problem comes first, dwelling formality! Great overstatement world today Denmark still death rate fifth Sweden Swedens number continue increase too. 

Plus death rate leading indicator there's going many times long term covid sufferers Sweden nations suppressed initial virulent outbreak. dollar reserve currency print without limit.

the EU euro.

The federal government always money. Optimal time testing 3-5 days exposure positive person. tested that, may negative virus replicated yet. East Asian men mask up, men able mask up. Many people significantly vulnerable others, come now. It’ll million Americans care enough anything it. Exactly this. I've shows. OP hard-on Chappelle despite running tighter ship freaking White House. probably right.

I watch keeps month ago 415,000 deaths estimated. Though restrictions totally eased predict .5 million high end.

Without doubt US reach half million vaccine comes out. Possibly less year since first outbreak. dude..... even 15% population infected. next phase normally amount peope reduced time frame. (some weird inverse square.) 

time frame 10 months quantity infected spread 2-3 months. current listed covid stay icu 4-21 optimistic.

without real shutdown; shit gonna real bad. great thing truth truth whether believe not. 

It shame though, read magazine lot uni. Maybe genuine mistake author based Berlin translation might issue. Fuck die. China's warm act.... preventable, anyone thinks something contagious prevented delusional wonder ""hoax"" story Israel?

In Germany, think idiots talk rights taken away.

Probably coronavirus fake also ""bad"" is...

just idiots world. None tested positive. Israeli here. 


The story prime minister absolutely anything get away trial, three tied elections, he's using virus try stop protests him.

Considering he's done past, I'm surprised people fall that. case complete denial like news story rare here. people dying old and/or ill every young death ""long hauler"" outlier. Less education leads lower paying jobs, leads lower health status shorter life. kids education high priority FHM. Just.... piles misinformation here.

Tons people 20s, 30s, 40s hit hard virus. COVID19 absolutely nothing flu, reason act like people going die anyway. fact that’s rather shitty sociopathic. plenty ways “fight directly” - scientists pushing social distancing, masks, lockdowns. People don’t like it, look workarounds. yes, *are* people blame America’s completely reprehensible handling crisis. include Trump’s Vietnam? No, know talking about. Chappelle's shows epitome post-COVID show looks like - outdoors, proper social distancing, temps taken, tests given, etc. took every precaution. soon positive test occurred (amongst event staff member could've contracted illness personal life), shut immediately - loosing thousands dollars.

Source: shows   Nothing else even close. 

Being obese smoker help either. UK even go herd immunity vaccine proved useful according recent reports. offering vaccine 50s vulnerables. situation TB different. disease around millenia times common deadly human population leading cause death, case England 19th century. extremely hard effectively treat cure, well prevent transmission, ship long sailed. According wikipedia: ""As 2018 one quarter world's population thought latent infection TB"". Imagine Coronavirus make ill week cleared system, stuck around years randomly making people ill infectious. moreover high (10%+) mortality rate presenting symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

So one saying deadly. tone seems suggest argument 'whataboutism' kind. say, deadlier worse diseases can't actively combat effectively moment mean ignore COVID. 
(Plus pointed below, fact far reaching measures \*have\* taken COVID means likely, ironically, quite seeing bad could ignored it) fuck anything this? bite. real concern transparency accountability linked research production vaccine. regulatory institutions whose existence solely create safe environment develop solutions, get sabotaged, paying attention information source, particularly negative ones, becomes critical. appreciate sharing negative news stories much positive ones. era every man, woman, child themselves, want much information access to, order make best decisions family. He's quite rotund surprised. 50% hate you.  50% want go back normal lives willing take chance COVID that.  understand risk.  one side virologists do. 

They want work.  want go football games.  want kids school.  want bet night friends. 

We hate way hated parents teenagers. Um, no. need stop cooking dirty shit labs releasing public I'm saying bad mental health used right.

Not Twitter worse better FB.

Necessary sacrifices sacred golden bull market... 

/s OH DEAR GOD....

It's either Voodoo Witch Alien Sex Doctor lady... know what's worse. Trump recovered fast, true superhuman considering 70s. Literally point conversation about”medical professionals lockdowns”  love him, people suck. really would better health long run anyway, expansion smaller farms would also increase food crop bio-diversity better everyone. pseudo science basically said sub saying whole time *coronavirus likes this* dischargeable death. Parent Plus loan though...they screwed. Heres testing study link CDC Could giant conspiracy millions people working concert fake pandemic? suppose technically impossible.

But considering difficulty perfectly coordinating thing, lack motivation millions supposed participants, logistic challenges so... one would think odds said conspiracy true would something ridiculously unlikely, like one 800 quintillion.  Making mind boggling someone would doubt covid real thing.

Talk cutting Occam's razor. obviously don’t know you’re talking full shit. Everything said goes research there. Stop spreading misinformation piss off. Solid analysis.

I think lot tests per day coming people schools, universities, jobs like mentioned (incl. politicians athletes) getting tested every day way whatever organization they're part cover hopefully get ahead outbreaks early. options getting better, mean Drs venting people ""too early"" start. Recall ask March/April stay home even sick seek medical treatment catastrophically ill. ""Go hospital need help breath."" going lead ideal outcomes. ""saving beds"" highly progressed disease, recent developments shown steroids, clot prevention, treatments helpful given appropriate time. March/April treatments widely used, often time someone saw Dr past point treatments would helpful.

Yeah interesting way framing it. treatments getting better fact we're testing much probably fewer fewer patients ever need get vented. 35.0 minute delay fetching comments.

  b. McConnell also wanted provision would allow employers sue employees bringing claim COVID infection offering settle court. Yes. McConnell wants employers able sue employees settling court. McConnell also wanted cap amount employees could receive cap amount employers could receive.

  c. McConnell wanted Attorney General William Barr given right sue unions, labor activists, lawyers, doctors — everyone involved coronavirus claims.

:( Supreme Court ruled secession unlawful, particularly light defeat Confederacy. Obviously victors war largely unaccountable crimes colonies revolt British Empire. yes break law according highest court land. Fort Sumter federal land. Even seceded lawfully, cannot short winning war, land continued belong US federal government rested US control. Finally, idea South didn’t begin war Fort Sumter went fucking window rest South joined attack idea Charleston didn’t participate went window citizens didn’t stop apparently completely rogue group militiamen, rather helping instead. cannot blithely diminish responsibility everything individuals. That’s ignorant allows dismiss responsibility almost atrocity war away collective individuals specifically executed plan. Remind 1 year. I’ll bet $100... in? forgot add “by January”. proven guilty compassion, shame you! Totally agree people United States died already coronavirus died influenza past five flu seasons combined.

Here's look numbers: The first person known died coronavirus United States died Feb. 29, according Johns Hopkins University. Seven months later, 210,000 Americans dead. Remember, “typical” flu season runs 7 months, October April.

According CDC estimates, many Americans died flu recent seasons:

2019-2020: 22,000 (preliminary)

2018-2019: 34,000 (preliminary)

2017-2018: 61,000 (preliminary)

2016-2017: 38,000

2015-2016: 23,000

2014-2015: 51,000

2013-2014: 38,000

2012-2013: 43,000

2011-2012: 12,000

2010-2011: 37,000

About 178,000 people died five flu seasons running 2015 2020, 210,000 people died coronavirus year. ""Justice"" System. 

Let's confused: America ""legal system,"" ""justice system,"" difference. What's worse? pay-to-win. feel like completely wrong. govt intervention countries, mass testing, expected mask usage, etc, accepted. testing US atrocious. live NY one could get test mid-Summer, general feeling medical care expensive arduous vast majority non-wealthy folks get tested unless absolutely to. Even teachers aren’t getting tested lot cases. 

There general sentiment America, even smart educated folks, exceptionalism here. would better mobilizing rolling testing lab results etc...and it’s true anymore. kind sucked every way dealing virus world shocked. China mobilized tested better across billion ppl we’ve come close 300MM, it’s sad really. America might need new classification Obese something. people literally 200% recommended weight be. We're talking people make blueberry girl Charlie Chocolate Factory look like normal human body. exaggeration. politics come play things disgusting. seems like people taking issue rhetoric instead semantics. career politician might read curated, focus-grouped version message teleprompter. Regardless, ""it is"" nothing neutral statement fact. would never occurred controversial people started making big fuss it. really sick someone forget took fall him, reckless pointless contradicts time almost every topic. I've never seen outright deny existence COVID-19. Yes Trump bigly part likes sucking trumps dick nothing coronavirus.

This Humane Society like factory farming, would want stop factory farming whether coronavirus not. ... current White House count, say? butt hurt?🤣😭🍿😱your name must Karen Brad kidding right ? 
A million+ deaths locksdowns mask mandates yet think people advocating steps trusted.  


Were dropped head chance childhood!! Wait, though lockdown Sweden? /s political personal disagreement. believe real. push narratives engage activities actively get others killed. deserve receive care. putting artificial values labour. tried before. Yes thank years ago didn’t remember everything exactly Already did, son. Apparently know difference words ""treat"" ""death."" Try brushing English. Belgian here. There's end sight. government inept, big pharma untrustworthy, every hope spot turned lie increase compliance.

By now, know vaccine 50% effective, 80% less even take government lied available. Events travel impossible foreseeable future,

I can't blame people partying next lockdown. everyone start wearing gas masks. totally impenetrable. Misinformation isn’t spreading days. They're basically still training. pretty universal North America least get paid peanuts. annual salary sometimes sound decent keep mind work insane hours. Looks good 👍 put title India tests highest world, comments put may soon become highest world? costs money long term future. Sadly lot children school safe away abusive parents, also child abusive noticed reported government. literal attempt saying ""No, I'm breath taking!""  one reasons stop nursing. lost compassion. process. stop judging people joining rolling eyes belittling behavior health care workers. happened day, every day. patients deserved better could give them. 

It right decision. reminded many times day. always simple. got richer value linked shares. shares rose value actually made LOT people well off. amount value linked share price much, much, much smaller.  


But 99% wealth Amazon stocks, would lot better too. is, still much better shares up, (hopefully) something retire on. Fucked Horrible ? best start believing dystopias. We're one. here's wish, hope go rules. hope suffers. hope struggles. hope feels real fear drowning hospital bed. hope survives physically affected rest life. hope - know one long shot - change heart result this. Again, nobody arguing get money treat. get money recording death. lose money. really slow? probably figured since white Herman Cain fine. get odds dying? needz make money stupidity. Surely dumb, since he's engineer,

This fallacy. we've seen countless times, intelligent skilled one area little correlation skill intelligence areas. Sometimes exceptionally skilled one area lead hubris others, despite actually skills intelligence them. wise person knows know something less actually know, apply things, assuming experts areas trusting experts them. People say idea common long haulers are. Remember panic Kawasaki disease? they're vegetarian, fact humans omnivores, need meat, biologically eat almost everything. That's ability eat meat, necessity. life. older cities, sidewalks park trails narrow get crowded people aren’t always able distance. Also, people seem erroneously think outdoor air immediately kill it, outdoor gatherings without masks get other’s faces. example, Supreme Court nominee event rose garden entirely outside it’s considered super-spreader event. rest case. Oh god, I’ve eager vote never occurred think salting ground rage 10 weeks get voted out. mistake yes meant sorry Finally, 17 September, seemed Fagan turning corner.

Let hear people call pro-life again, please. 200K+ dead people losing loved ones. compassion? ""tolerable"" losses ""need"" put with? buy N95s? I've buying KF94s world big. Generation X created lot hippies still plenty people rebel. people born time held tight religious beliefs feelings white supremacy ones still charge today. least three case studies. Chinese restaurant April, buffet restaurant south Korea, aforementioned Starbucks. Louisiana quarter contact tracing nut associated prison nursing home led bar restaurant. North Carolina contact tracing ""showed 36% infected people frequented restaurants breweries, 38% went gatherings family friends. Less 10% people reported going weddings, funerals places worship."" That's whopping 2% difference. 

 cdc study also included family gatherings questionnaire. while, no, correlation equal causation, common sense says activity, especially indoors, absolutely necessitates mask removal going automatically risky. Even within households, epidemiologists found mealtimes period greatest .

I'm saying people likely engage high risk activities dining itself, maskless frequently indoor nature it, makes one riskiest activities. ask family members quarantine, wear masks houses, can't eat mask know people restaurant been. facial expression picture tells whole story. It’s .... just.... a... flu........ 

*Dies* Again, incentive record death. get money treat. lose money there's death due Medicare Value-based Program incentives. facts. I'm sorry fell Republican's propaganda. highly effective people know talking about. suppose surprised. People deny climate change spite overwhelming evidence. people deny facts reported Coronavirus?

People want stick head sand comes uncomfortable truths. in: “Epidemiologists, medical researchers, doctors idiots” says reddit user. wasnt 1-2 million before? Thats actually pretty good seeing know virus [archive link anyone trouble accessing article know causes new virus bacteria ? Animals, factory farming

What proof opinion?

And plants animals. Good luck getting people board understand lockdowns cause harm good. I’m convinced people board either young understand stupid. buy them? I'm still using couple N95's bought months aho, need wear one less hour per month. covid nocturnal? /s Incompetence.  cigarette deaths much worse due decades misinformation propaganda. 1,300 people die day due cigarettes, far COVID numbers. lifetime cigarette smoking worse COVID, sure. fact comparable wake call. Dosage projections official release. million full production sound like lot, targeted smaller number people likely hospitalised. Let guess: Melbourne moving NZ?

Don't blame you. somewhat sick restrictions I'm glad live Melbourne Victoria matter. Im agine online schools barely able leave house. Also, thought banned ppl entering leaving Melbourne lot security borders well cancelling public flights  like modern factory farming thats problem, meat eating general.

Seems like inability poor people make money rather problem wealth inequality. 

Meat eating root cause, like not. Unless important survival, can't justified. important survival. fact well known even detrimental survival since causes many heart problems people. Lol. Yeah, cases increase schools open. things world? Watching another human suffer ability help makes bad person. anyone fucking dumb function adult? 

The solace find people I’m competing life. Promotions, dating, business, etc. mean I’m competing bunch people deep left side bell curve, wackos like often higher positions society, unfortunately. look Oval Office. Glorious leader dedicated self providing us immunity virus! Surge 9... Remine much white house count again? understand point. flu also less lethal younger populations versus older populations, still lethal compared COVID, particularly taken account *the fact flu  That’s crazy! idea. Wonder got pizza business then? guess work pilsbury coke helped even seems different starting pizza chains. poster right factory farming coronavirus unrelated. Chinese people would eat factory-farmed animals, situation, people factory farm bats pangolins knows what.

This poster fool falling dozenth iteration KGB plit 1983 discredit US claiming developed HIV lab order kill black people. Since then, nonsense story recirculated every new disease.

Someone tell Republicans virus helps voting. they’ve done restrict Americans voting protect Virus. difference wars (mostly unnceccassary) killed people prime lives. Yea I've tried start reducing meat went grab bag frozen chicken, saw started scanning see else had.... realized jesus christ, they've got like 300 bags chicken here, one aisle one store city, refresh shit like weekly. That's many damn chickens.

That said though usually opt straight veggies meatless alternatives. Wish liked em, can't stand taste not-meat meats. Bwahahah still al you’ve got? Fauci recommending masks March?

You realize it’s October now?

You people fucking disingenuous full bad people alllllll projection? guy loves trump, would take administration worships?  beaches whale. People argued. reasonable person would realize masks save lives given evidence. Absolutely one except paranoid pushing idea ""tracking chips"" relation covid. Schopenhauer disagrees you. lol going this? stay home wtf Remember Dr. Fauci important outbreak pandemic, everyone hung dry spoke truth.

Pepperidge Farms remembers. let get straight... Swedes obey ""recommendations"" maintain social distancing etc, unless wearing mask. Even FHM said ""maintain social distancing times, public also wear mask"", suddenly Swedish people would stop listening them?

Is argument? Yeah, scientists know sh\*t. That's listen ever, see, everything fine! /s really true Hong Kong - yes, island called ""Hong Kong"", that's part territory. population land area Kowloon New Territories - physically part Chinese mainland. kind says already even try ton conndescensingly pretend didnt? Although yes something solid. know definitively know common reinfection be. know harmful reinfection be.

But engage since youve shown willing outright misrepresent anything say behave like ass. group recieved bunch well deserved criticism, first produced bunch graphs showed Sweden heading towards something like 10k death end March/begining April. People asked came conclusions never responded. 
Shortly produced 7 day average graphs using data points monday, tuesday wednsday extrapoliting whole week (ignoring there's hardly reporting weekends, get included monday tuesdays reports). 
Another member went public radio said warning corona since January, advocating face masks since. there's videos newsbroadcasts early march recomending people go ski-trips since europe currently safe. april he's news stating maks public proven effect spread.

No aren't. Black are, Indigenous 2x, Latino 1.4x compared White. Asians lower all, We're missing it. care. Honestly recent wars compared it.

Americans insanely low tolerance soldier deaths compared Vietnam. dozen troops killed front page news week compared 1955, buried tenth fold.

These days Joint Chiefs know Americans demand 10,000 1 ratio calculate wars based it. Apaches Predators shit now. Afghanistan jungle war. Washington would disagree.

Which likely isnt dont think far bribe, blackmailing. can't imagine Americans type appreciate blackmailed. Hoping stopped payment checks.

Trump desperate cash. criticize trump rallies politic reasons event  gathering people (because agree blm event happen even pandemic)...i dont see anyproblem hate trump too. specify clear reasons dont agree something. dont, look like hypocritical. feel like ""deaths due infection"" pretty relevant stat pandemic people die secondary symptoms.

I would love alive 80 years historians calculate many Americans died secondary effects like pneumonia asthma caused COVID rather directly COVID. 

Not take sort medically historically, also take biggest windfall lawsuits history mankind sort reported common public.  Hell masks mandated. That's America grew in, that's America want spend second half under. means wear mask, impose others, problem it. That's opinion matter. Time tell happens. Exactly Fear mongering bs India tests million everyday become highest testing numbers. may soon overtake US cases due population testing numbers.

US still remains number one spot despite steep decline testing numbers. South Dakota governor uses coronavirus relief funds $5 million tourism ad despite COVID surge
SEPTEMBER 10, many people Americans kill respective wars, minus world war 1? states report timing average timing like 1.75 days recently looked That’s terrible idea middle pandemic.

SOMETHING CAUTIOUS Keep away Bill Burr! response COVID-19 nothing atrocious, vast majority (80%+) deaths age 65 years old. combination wars, average age died 20’s. 

Worth noting however Americans live average 16 years longer 1940 older people far likely still working participating actively community workplace displaces significant amount disparity. Pandemrix comes lot, important point clinical trials less rigorous currently progress. find measly n=100 trials GSK ran different age groups [few so-called larger ""mock-up"" trials vaccine containing strain H5N1 rather H1N1 - performed anticipation bird flu pandemic. actual vaccine tested around [2,000 European approval.

Compare current trials, we've got actual candidates tested trials tens thousands (60,000 J&amp;J, 44,000 Pfizer etc.). would argue *far* rigorous moment. Americans oftenly overestimate losses war agree. better comparison compare flu associated deaths year far 2020 COVID.

Last checked, thousand flu related deaths (about 7000) US, versus already 200K+ killed COVID. Yes, numbers tentative, trend occurring consistently outside US well. played video showing face deceased person Covid 19 would last roughly 56 hours.

Just think 56 hour long movie showing face dead person every second...


If dem would video playing behind every chance could. Vaccines . gov links state's health department help find vaccination clinics low cost free vaccines without insurance. states cities giving flu shots free year prevent second Wow puts perspective many really killed bombs tbh. always felt like much less that. Horrific. immunity comes antibodies. body stops producing time immune anymore. Anyone get again.

Keep mind Covid-19 also seems weaken immune system. often get it, severe symptoms. believe official numbers one second. many stories (here Netherlands) people dying cancer listed covid deaths. would that? would use footage Italys overcrowded hospital show news NY hospital. many cases list. even naming name get one way ticket ""don't listen him, he's conspiracy nut"" camp. Why? joke right? 1000 tests city 37 million? Hope Hicks patient 0 white house? infected someone inside? interesting media seems already suggesting one infected everyone. irony lockdown Europe, since trace test programme we're back beginning. proper test trace proper quarantine visitors now. previous year president would care... trump baby! mean. secede. may lasted long. did. army, government, constitution, postal system, even bank notes. success. crumbled four years later, reabsorbed.

To add onto that, would people respond asked question ""Are American?"" I'd wager least Confedate states still existed, they'd say no. Maintaining year however long expensive good chance could give sell abandon places. I'm American, genuinely confused Americans think hoax? train thought, think trying harm 'hoax'?

It's absurd cannot even wrap head around it. American tweets see condemning Joe Biden supporting Donald Trump.. shocking! replicated fine vr headset (fov, resolution, distance, etc), everything noises bunch humans least glad rid anyways. Killing old people makes country competitive. 

When young people die war problem; problem war cannot sustained, political considerations.

I sure people continue surprised. Please understand opinion, straight state strategy. want different response next time, go politics.  wonder many people died regular flu last year.

And I’m curious accurate numbers are. many elderly, many serious preexisting conditions, many already death’s door dying something else caught COVID?

Sometimes wonder people would like inflate number deaths political reasons. Well question becomes complicated get Reddit step real world you’re equating lot broad, reasonable personal liberties “someone’s right party” it’s little bit complicated nuanced you’re trying make seem. small important detail lot people arent aware Pretty much title. increasing fast, hospitalizations increasing too, government react tighten measures. worst region 300 new daily cases per 100k people. units 9/11s

Those known ""Freedom Units"". Also Swed*n collapsed economy destroyed fabric society longer case. prevented owning theaters consent decree Trump administration terminated.  Yea lol everyone conveniently forgets much easier country like New Zealand outside world. They’re tiny island nation tiny population middle bumfuck nowhere, Pacific Ocean. 

I’m denying they’ve done amazing job handling virus, saying fact they’re island reason they’ve done well. It’s not. it’s definitely one reasons. risk death identical scenarios. strawman situations logically equivalent. 

Unless, course, believe preventable Covid deaths less tragic preventable Antifa deaths. Normall humans absorb food inserted rectally though. 😏 dude. stop saying dumb shit. nobody ever executed secession. treason? yes. fitting got movements protesting masks propagating HAES. way illnesses decimate population due people living denial.

Dead people rights. many citizens politicians cannot imagine temporarily suspending rights, 200k Americans lost rights permanently face much longer ""temporary"" period restricted rights. Lol 
Just post link doesn’t make true. bet one likes friends. wave built summer carelesness, difficult control. think gonna try half-ass way forced another lockdown. Sad. Let zoom in, like us mere mortals do. winning, yay! country numbers compared population? Serious now? 

The response america explains death number, single country insane numbers. germany changed nothing barley deaths. difference could see makes sense difference counting would explain it. old people. worse demographic germany america. really get it. healthcare explains difference either. quality healthcare better america here, poor people allowed denied care. 

Is really impossible might chance america political financial reasons reports corona deaths? mean entire country, mean hospitals would count people died reason, would counted towards corona. Lets say example hospitals financial incentive this, would already result this, matter do. /r/rareinsults Yup .Wisconsin mask order ""except eating drinking"" infection rate highest nation rn well, America people obsessed right. end get people fighting right walk naked public insanity like that.

Rights fetish important public health.

Better lose rights keep people alive. Nah, almost assured nobody got infected there. show anymore tagged harmful misinformation. Fair enough. almost nothing virus everything pathetic driveling leadership, Donald Trump band morons Well, virus still ongoing. Right 2 - 3% population infected. get 10x infected, would 2 million dead. too.

This letting go Honestly, vaccine short amount time impossible want safety efficacy high Sorry mate. see link I’ve posted twice already. well known factual reporting. think go memory It’s actually pretty badly written. stuff even factually incorrect. opinion piece. don’t even live   count chairs lives ruined lockdowns, suicides caused lockdowns, people put risk death poverty lockdowns. Something tells would dwarf chair picture. 

Oh, we're talking *all* lives, [almost argue otherwise. find discussing lockdowns, suddenly globally-minded, anti-nationalist enlightened Reddit want discussion goes outside borders. Whenever articles like one I've linked posted here, they're usually deleted get handful comments. post Lana Del Rey's fucking mesh mask gets 1.3k comments.

Taylor Swift's dad bought label essentially. common story music industry. That's putting 2 2 together really well :) Deserved point driven country? pick apart article want seems quite factual don’t see conflicting statements it. 
  Well tell state less 200 deaths makes people feel like issue. also makes people angry restrictions reason low number deaths. Republicans still give shit.

More people died Covid-19 past 5 flu seasons combined

Earlier morning, President Trump falsely claimed tweet coronavirus “in populations far less lethal"" flu.

More people United States died already coronavirus died influenza past five flu seasons combined.

Here's look numbers: The first person known died coronavirus United States died Feb. 29, according Johns Hopkins University. Seven months later, 210,000 Americans dead. Remember, “typical” flu season runs 7 months, October April.

According CDC estimates, many Americans died flu recent seasons:

2019-2020: 22,000 (preliminary)

2018-2019: 34,000 (preliminary)

2017-2018: 61,000 (preliminary)

2016-2017: 38,000

2015-2016: 23,000

2014-2015: 51,000

2013-2014: 38,000

2012-2013: 43,000

2011-2012: 12,000

2010-2011: 37,000

About 178,000 people died five flu seasons running 2015 2020, 210,000 people died coronavirus year. very, small risk use masks, social distancing wash hands. 

Plus, Zoom classes joke. course kids love them! see bodies street news, saw mass graves NYC trucks bodybags Italy news, effectively thing.

Also, outside enemy focus anger on, people going beach. I've seen many news stories people shamed gathering fun.

Also, 2.8 million Americans die every year actually yes, bad. would say pissed away? used pay fo military goods, kept people job companies produce military goods? 

At least people honest job, otherwise might lived welfare, that's expensive!

/s course I'm nit criticising it. stating fact. think need professional help  Ive seen many times career. Many times. Oh yes have.

If secession ain't successful land jail get executed. Temporarily sacrifice rights later gain better use rights seems beyond people's thinking. China locked hard months along heavy efforts eliminate community spread, people go normal lives right now. Countries effectively squandered time bought whatever lockdown place, lockdown longer economically emotionally sustained, people forced go work play middle pandemic get worse reopening. always felt like part 50s throwback schtick. talk WW2 ? Post-rock contemporaries? talking Godspeed You! Black Emperor, what? Yeah. 328 million people live US, died covid that'd 1 328 million people. Therefore, gives shit died? Maybe article biased?

The point Sweden culture consensus absolutely true, it’s something fall back *everytime* recieve criticism. Sometimes it’s deserved. someone pointed here, based lot proposed actions ”models” predicted death toll ended 10x higher actual one. article also published one Sweden’s largest newspapers. fact, there’s continuous stream pieces published large newspapers, calling harsher measures, mask mandates etc. notion nationwide censorship ideas aren’t sanctioned ”the public” isn’t true. 


The article contains conflicting statements well. starts saying Sweden’s testing still lags behind countries, later reports ramped testing tests many people Norway (which true). 

It also reports latest increase cases Stockholm ”surge”, word obviously chosen reinforce bleak picture article wants convey. know ”surge” hard define, increase fact linear and, far, quite slow. 

There lot justified criticism one give FHM government handling this. don’t give much anecdotal, biased pieces like one. country US can't keep testing can't expect India test based population. best done increase testing much possible maintain there. Tests come free government citizens. fuck morgan wallen expected Singing strongly associated super-spreader events people emit droplets sing also inhale deeply, carrying people's droplets lungs. must done, persuade done outdoors masks distancing? Try risk estimation tool date... different date format. Preposterous. one going this. I’m gosh awful California. almost everywhere initial huge spike starts slope.

It's called harvesting definitely thing: definitely probably main factor initial spike deaths.

Europe warm winter mild flu season last year, lot people would died normal year still around March Covid take them. much important note that:

1. Places like UK probably identified 5% Covid cases spring — CFR hugely inflated, even record-breaking positive tests probably reflect high level infection six seven months ago; 
2. better understanding treatments work, least partially - there's cure room ameliorate symptoms let body work, reduce death rate.

So I'd say there's chance see return CFR spring — equally, possible could still see substantial increase deaths high case numbers filter through. seems crazy isn’t already effect. Pence it, high possibility point, little plexiglass shields poor substitute remote debate. No, hasn't. covid hoax haha think dipshit reddit types. I've seen various polls suggest unfortunately low level trust vaccine general (I guess due rushed timeframe, opinion largely misconception), importantly decreasing even go along, allegedly due recent [concerns seems possible concerns could stronger vaccine seems ""deliberately"" released prior election, versus one released time that. 

Is smart feel way? course not, timing vaccine play decision get all, research look data. many people research look data? nearly enough. want people possible get vaccine, do, perhaps post-election approval/release would beneficial. Wait, hit anywhere close 3%. antibody testing shows metric shit people covid never got positive test. NYC area like 25% entire population get major outbreak March/April. That's deaths sooo bad back then. Literally 3 4 million infected, tests yet, none counted.

Death rate 2% sure correct undercounting infections undercounting deaths. probably around 1.4%, given information far, 90%+ deaths people 70 older.

That's trying downplay anything, stating factual information statistics far disease progression. would catastrophic nation dramatic decrease birth rates, especially nation like Singapore long life expectancy increasingly aging population need supported old age.

The big question coming developing nations pay population old boomers fewer fewer young people (proportionally) work, spend keep economy afloat. Good luck telling elderly people stay indoors months end. stubborn 😂  fucking hasn't. Ffs. Still low. UK testes quarter india tests. 250 000 day ( sometimes 280 000) 66 000 000 people, 1.5 billion. meant lot people would traveling internationally previous years travel domestically instead year, numbers inflated. people still staying home. agree. can't imagine scenario I'm tempted move US. Watch Ken Burns decoumentary. think still netflix. goes first bit french problems, America getting help councel military trainers 64 65 started ship soldiers combat escalated there. you, kind prophet lol makes seem worse is, testing much April things would seem much different, say things bad. Movie theaters already decline, looks like Covid sped things up. Well numbers exactly tale telling. needs kind precise targeted testing percentage skyrocket. 

Uless test randomly across whole population. goes test? Mainly people, suspicion infected got track traced. plays numbers, people likely infected... ok, Gooord save Swedish authorities actively discouraged people wearing face masks, said would spread panic

Did anyone remember happening? ""Panic"" reason mandating masks? 

This whole article seems like opinion piece picking various weird facts (like doctor supposedly fired etc).  go Steven Hahn, man make decisions. let's see long lasts...  Sounds like part backlash.

He's Swedish. Like article says, going groupthink taboo Swedish society. everyone 

You need everyone stop wearing masks. Several states already completely opening up. get point hospitals full triage done gates, number deaths explode advances treatment going help can't get treatment.

This already happened NYC; reason 1000 deaths day NYC alone pandemic first hit.

The question whether states completely re-opened stubbornly remain open cases deaths inevitably increase. -- surprised couple -- things could get really bad states. perspective? US population grew 200 million WW1 2020, event today way affected back then. Reddit preys uneducated morons push narrative.  Apples pomegranates 41,000 second hand smoke? studies prove almost zero risk second hand smoke major study back? Eight stars! gives big bonus Dictator Universalis autobattles, right? also reduce attrition, AI battle computer still grind cannon fodder like mad? really true number given. defending article all. saying, everything beyond estimate.

Yes, somewhat accurate estimate better fact that, true, misrepresented (i.e., stating known correctly calculated CFR mortality rate, i.e., chance random person infected Covid die, rather chance someone much smaller subset positive test). Unless commit treason support slavery Two possible factors: People really like spending time outdoors air conditioning isn’t big here.

Hopefully numbers stay low though even nice weather ends. Im curious looks like terms percent population. Holy shit, almost 24% positive tests. thought we're currently pretty badly Slovenia 7-9% positives. AK Sen - Al Gross

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* still believe China's numbers.

Think many issues we've purposefully inaccurate reporting? 

You think China forthright? truly agree sentiments obesity. Obesity fact put people higher risk category could add death toll. 
As said another comment, diet important part losing weight. poor tend affected healthy food options time consuming expensive society. society enables options ridiculously high trans fats carbs easiest access. problem could probably helped government programs, mandates, PSAs etc. 

 far ""big beautiful"" thing concerned, stop supporting message gets received people thinking OK live unhealthy self destructive lifestyle. feel message originally intended reinforce people comfortable thicker curvy spread awareness fat people unhealthy, repulsive slobs. Unfortunately, social trend government would difficult time meddling in.

All said, coronavirus special issue needs taken seriously America needs leader willing tell people treat seriously well. people can't come together form consistent effective strategy virus, believe would handle deadlier one better. 215k dead 7 months acceptable losses, ask, ""What death toll/death rate required us start giving shit?""

Edit: changed ""it"" society WW2 casualties mostly young men compared COVID victims average 10 years left live Wat I'm laughing mad. I'm pointing IFR lower said. guess that's good sub? Sorry, fucking deal it. I’m sure Port Elizabeth got used socialising. 

People social animals. socialising 100.000 years. 
I'm sorry really like smell comment. 

You right closed spaces, doubt science. summer Europe almost entirely corona free deaths. case, really want tell people semi lockdown mode? also still economy run here. beside also replacing one health crisis another, suicides rise depression rising day day. 

So summer open free, nice, loved it.Although shittiest summer ever, since events many rules place, still enjoyed it. BLM protest Europe stop referring them,. Europe segregation, apartheid racism system lead government. 

If look countries really opened up. Like Austria, dropping almost rules. see summer easy going, cases. see second wave already flattening. opposite stating. People fatigued rules, able release 4 months. follow new energy. easy use covid excuse colonialism. Alright,


There God. it? think ok date molesters, arsonists, murderers? No, I'm sure don't. think enough good cops count. Well, figure sooner later.

Seems we're impasse. take point, none less. Thicc thoths n preyus  old age killed anything.

/s case clear 600,000 people die heart disease year. So, whole article failure Yes talking two things. One left could pretend people enough information 3-5 years.

Just seen mean confirmed last months, multiple new discoveries since. Feel free educate it.

Again, can't state actually know. don't. said people could acknowledge decided now. can't.

Nihilism nothing world stating ""everybody dies"" completely unnecessary pointless. shows people point even discussion you. Cant answer that, guess would guess

Corona virus mass extinction event

Since apparently million dead reason caution.
As said guess.  Next crisis. **Billionaires' wealth rises $50.2 trillion** Considering Louis CK around he’s got kinds exposure worry about. US may 410,000 dead end year. ...but iPhones made China, slavery happens.  Mandatory masks, restaurant restrictions, crackdown gatherings 8. sucks works. *Loui Eriksson I'm sure dismiss stupidity, even stupidity technically reason it. think he's got point, least something considered (although I'm really sure ""figure out"" get actual answer). least think impact might outcome.

Consider two possible realities. reality A, vaccine approved 10/30, Friday election. media runs rampant interviews opinion pieces political stunt Trump (whether actually is) help election. 5% population swayed ""information"" decides they're longer confident process they'll hold getting vaccine. reality B, vaccine approved 11/6, Friday election. Votes cast, nobody runs stories Trump pressuring process political points. 5% swayed take vaccine available, process set behind 1 week ""real"" reason, means extra people going die. 

Which one better? reality A, less people get vaccinated, sucks. people end dying that. reality B, people die right away, also sucks. one sucks more? think answer clear suggesting. idiot Yea sure many many many people can't afford a

Yes healthcare. would hit dad big roid shot chemo, would go 48 hours solid. zonk day straight. He's gonna crash. Wasn’t outside balcony? Lt. Aldo “The Apache” Raine would disagree Author: CJ Daniels Updated: 6:28 PM EDT October 6, 2020

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Mitch McConnell firing back Senate challenger retired Marine Lt. Colonel Amy McGrath, one day called Senate Majority Leader take COVID-19 test prior Oct. 12 debate.

McGrath also called McConnell take test least week release results contact Kentuckians.

This comes President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump handful GOP senators press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tested positive many attended Sept. 26 event president introduced Supreme Court pick, Amy Coney Barrett.

It’s clear event source outbreak many attended event Rose Garden wear masks practice social distancing CDC guidelines.

McConnell attend event met Barrett days ceremony. Barrett since tested negative.

However, McConnell disclosed recently tested virus released statement Tuesday, criticizing McGrath.

“I’m unaware Amy McGrath went medical school, take health care advice doctor, political opponent. end campaign season, it’s imperative us tune erratic uninformed campaign rhetoric make health care decisions based CDC guidance health care professionals,” McConnell said statement.

McGrath called longtime senator “irresponsible” telling public whether recently tested not.

“We brink constitutional crisis, president members Congress infected potentially deadly disease, McConnell still isn’t taking seriously,” said McGrath. “We scheduled take stage together debate week, must get tested release results day debate least. basic respect working get debate done safely.” oppose throwing around totalitarian labels left right, one put smile face. flu every year kills people killed American revolutionary war, Iraq war, war 1812, war Afghanistan, Mexican American war put together.

Well post one math I'm sure willful ignorance point maybe school never taught find biased writing. anyone else reading, here's text article copied pasted:


""Some doctors insisted wearing mask work reprimanded even fired."" - one misunderstanding one place. assure you, GPs wearing masks point.

""Testing Sweden still lags behind many countries."" - yes, also much better. average. sentence trying claim otherwise would say that. 


""While cities worldwide turned ghost towns, Swedes could seen chatting cafés working gym.""

Next paragraph:

""The country ignore threat entirely. Although stores restaurants remained open, many Swedes stayed home, rates similar European neighbors, surveys mobile phone data suggest.""

-which then? stay home go out? fact could still go cafes gyms specially author issue with? agree, followers though... said many time say again: people ""believe"" coronavirus admitted hospital get sick send back home. Lots vegans here. Let people eat want, health yours. Also, prudence preparation fire base lead ""campaign contributions.""

America corporatist state, passing cost onto general public par course. fund automatically split donations: numbers end July would, honestly. Though entering death phase baby boomers, get explained away that, you’d expect gradual explosion like went through. They’ve pretty easy republicans/conservatives last 5 years Lol, important information omitted, especially part underlying birth defect true cause death Covid later tacked supplementary testing discovered baby also Covid. Wait - everything life black white easy discern? taught that? Someone life? That's red flag. They're gaslighting you. need cut toxicity life right now. 
Most people get gastric bypass fail don’t really care well honestly . yet nobody complained surveillance state arose extreme levels security airports patriot act guantanamo.

Um... millions people complained. Millions still do. sure pulling ""no one complained"" from. Blah blah blah FDA serious problems comes approving new medicine/medical devices. need increase funding make robust reason, unique different country drives people exact denial?

There reason unique country, come America. reason many people tend ignore things fit world view.

And second reason come America, called Social Media. Social Media provided echo chambers nutters previously would known other. holding individual belief, unable organize ""educate"" other. Social Media, do, words spread.

If world view Bill Gates and/or George Soros evil, Aliens already invaded earth, Jews/Freemasons/Illuminati/... controlling world financial system, press spreads fake news, population actively decimated using ChemTrails 5G whatever, ...

Then possibility really new virus, invention Bill Gates, evil Aliens, Freemasons, requires change behaviour, fit world view must fake. since people symptoms, tested number infections grow. Poland already tripled number daily cases doubled daily deaths two weeks. Dude, everyone vulnerable. Nobody knows long term result is. Maybe mass sterilization. It’s existed around year. Better get it, assume it’s hunky dory big deal “science” tells otherwise.  trait Reddit whole unfortunately. could share story girlfriend took last fry basket sharing, someone paint narrative selfish, gigantic red flag, million things.

If share ANYTHING family member, someone find fault hone that. easy (talking racist uncle literal lifesaving family member), others still downright awful dirty (basically anyone shares story female family member). Imagine stupid. understand it. could literally google “seniors Biden poll” get multiple articles. okay. [Here’s Lol really love says corona killed americans iraq , lol like common americans know poked killed much wanted top claimed soldiers fighting nation freedom lmao . Last time checked country us never invaded oil sniffers fucked t'l flipped upside ? 
And im arab fellow human enough decency tell people United States died already coronavirus died influenza past five flu seasons combined.

Here's look numbers: The first person known died coronavirus United States died Feb. 29, according Johns Hopkins University. Seven months later, 210,000 Americans dead. Remember, “typical” flu season runs 7 months, October April.

According CDC estimates, many Americans died flu recent seasons:

2019-2020: 22,000 (preliminary)

2018-2019: 34,000 (preliminary)

2017-2018: 61,000 (preliminary)

2016-2017: 38,000

2015-2016: 23,000

2014-2015: 51,000

2013-2014: 38,000

2012-2013: 43,000

2011-2012: 12,000

2010-2011: 37,000

About 178,000 people died five flu seasons running 2015 2020, 210,000 people died coronavirus year. Cheers! spreads camera now? Biden can't anything without Senate, authority impose state-level restrictions guidelines.

Look, he's getting vote happily, overstating power President here. ""mommy"" groups singled though? Outside reddit really social media. think bars vs schools reasonable trade off. ones choose bars open important represent pretty sick society. Actually underlying birth defect true cause death, since happened also covid counted covid death. shit take long? Every country would better making masks mandatory outside home shit gets better/vaccines arrive.  etc: avoidable belong argument.

What argument making? Seems like stated stat compared two. Either way, obesity diabetes belong conversation:

 high amounts cases U.S. citizens, lack education information diet health, well lack access nutrition many communities, contribute this. mention race undeniable comes consideration higher cases diabetes (60% likely) increased likelihood everything already mentioned. also 7th common cause death globally.

We also steadily approaching economic recession, million Americans alone work. Many people get insulin employer-provided insurance. risk ever this.

Just something avoidable, mean part conversation. Like guy 87M Twitter followers, got recently, saying flu much worse... 1/3 way beating Spanish flu wish could upvote 110,000 times Thanks another worthless comparison. America killed Vietnamese, Koreans, Iraqis Afghans Coronavirus One side argument: Call protect health safety millions suffering Americans based data provided tens thousands doctors, health experts, officials researchers representing every developed nation planet.

Other side argument: Nuh-uh! Bullshit! real! Fake news! George Soros conspiracy!

I mean anybody's debate point, sides definitely made pretty compelling arguments. guess fair solution nothing see happens, right? /s long term consequences suffering from? I’m genuinely curious. Yeah, yeah, state explicitly banned studio audiences. SNL thought smart this. America Got Talent this. money SNL.

This cause another outbreak, watch. People need stop stuffing fat faces. haha, capbility write 400 twitter one day, president Trump done now, may this. posts forum saying Flu+covid likely serious effects. Damn- comment based combination academic opinion personal anecdotal evidence integrates pretty well reasonable realistic timeline w/out hysterics? Good see one infamous subreddits late rewarding lol.  Stop pushing Q nonsense. “top scientist” trying deliberately infect everyone go back bar whatever. I'm it. I'm big cooking home invite closed circle friends get drunk together. won’t say loudly herd means 3M people die also takes years achieve. Good plan genius. Climate change? Telling full story get clicks sell advertising. even older people. Millions young people highly vulnerable one seems take notice them. Wow edgy. 

Enjoy! That’s great idea, long mod mute button! also puts perspective little americans died WWI, Italy lost 1.240.000 people war. knew came late idea much! interesting bogus numbers have. What’s source? ""severe"" that's rough one. Knowing might placebo help one participants get really sick. I'm saying right wrong...just scary. mad him? mad weak-ass federal response. wish everyone willing try this, current plan operations seem working well:

""Maybe 50 percent hate think I'm trying destroy country, listen six weeks so, say, see numbers go down,"" Fauci pleaded, according I'm sure that's truly educational advantage merely neat fact. There's nothing complex advanced remembering particular fact make purview truly ""smart."" Denmark introduced masks second half August several small outbreaks declining time introduced masks. three times larger increase cases outbreaks even mask mandate. things really clearly cut-and-dry present masks solve everything. Ok, think people Georgia were? Americans. “The people Georgia” means people reside state permanent close ya dummies.

Just temporary. “Until notice” means still intent open, matter might be. probably everyone gets vaccinated spring next year. long run everything cost. next 6-12 months school cost produce money, calculations though. Oh drama.. almost like things could damaging talk them.
Do know % people test positive still experiencing problems? think so, least anecdotally. group people got suburbs birthday party wore masks, would likely make news suburb least Mom Facebook groups. People ""need"" lots things. E X R N  Yeah sure don’t know anything. Btw yields inflation expectations right now? % gdp bar industry? Maybe put numbers educate us dumbasses even know wtf trying argue about. COVID-19 deaths concern you, say move Edgelord self Thots prayers. Like destroying economy causing huge amounts mental problems? We’ve local theater go business get bought another company every 10 years so. big deal. theater still there, another company running it.

However, may find movie theaters attractive anymore streaming content available much less money. 

My daughter regularly watch parties Hulu friends great time. we’re vaccinated we’ll watch parties houses. fun theater. “media manufactured boogeyman”, mean feared Muslim terrorists, even though vast majority terrorist activity stems meddling destabilizing. caused people many nationalities killed military, Iraqis. write covid deaths ""respiratory complication"" cremate dead almost immediately.

Just think: they're barely testing living, well think they're testing dead? forecast really depends several assumptions, exactly -- forecast.

How long pandemic last as-is? We're getting 800-1000 deaths/day US, heading fall / flu season. lets say 1000 deaths / day. pretty reasonable assumption say safe effective vaccine another 100-200 days. Costa Rica great, try it. disgraceful Effin RINO Gavin, thank joining. No. Well, taking Italy example, completely overwhelmed cases cope would 7 % known infected, counting people need care without Covid (heart attacks simply stop something else takes resources). impossibly high number 10 million people theoretical case. assuming went fine, never heard anything else it. I’m sorry Sportsball canceled old people dying. must make super depressed, able watch grown men play child’s game. Shame gran. rest died due injury something infection? infection numbers climbing daily, there’s 1500 deaths day, White House riddled COVID, yet despite that, still think almost over?

Alrighty then. It’s good SNL back, let’s shorten show stops cast runs good sketches musical guests time being. US hoax libs dash Trump's re-election bid.

I wonder ""hoax"" story Israel? unacceptable?

If ok serve food, can't someone eat favorite bar? eat somewhere else? Delusional people japan still want 2021 olympics. Plus, want East Asians can't deal coronavirus even though nothing. know effective long-lasting people's post-infection immunity say likely scenario immunity long-term future reinfections become milder.”

Isn't vaccines come play? difference deaths young men, 25% coronavirus deaths nursing homes vast majority people underlying medical conditions. Still sad nearly traumatic war. president telling people covid big deal, driving around secret service members he's shedding virus, overriding FDA regulations vaccine, taking mask whenever can. 

There's simply way separate virus politics right now. politics huge part what's going virus moment. Imagine wanting Toledo badly go war it? Freaking Toledo! started listening month ago really love it! Never knew much good information everyone speaks eloquently McConnel's particularly terrible example turtle. Sorry association friend. 😔 Isnt like 20% survival rate ventilator?

It _was_ low back early days. But, saw, improved greatly since we've learned COVID-19. live Naples? also amount tuition debts dentists? Yeah, luckily things much better now. Yeah, use Facebook exactly way, choose avoid political stuff probably without much difficulty. 

You’re really anything help argument. I've read people think swab GIVES COVID I'm like... what?!?! *most plea exact fucking opposite, pleaded people *not* take coronavirus seriously. understand there's scientific method google search made, checked percentage people age 50 true URL kind spells ""Boo"" that's kind neat Also someone manual labor. automated everything yet, retail manual work can't teenagers college kids, someone work young people learning overnight paid living wage health care PTO put time. think idiots. happened 10 years ago. think state based actors fermenting feeding bot farms etc negatively affect rivals. ideas help, wanted offer virtual hug, want it. hope things work soon, friend. Stay strong. become political. political things scams lies, one way another. keep wanting get another antibody test myself, similar situation. worst ""cold"" life end Feb, including 4-week cough doom. Tested negative antibodies, still think weird hit uniquely-horrible sickness right around time covid hit live NY. I'm person original comment, know talking along lines ""8pm curfew, traveling 5km home, absolutely nothing open, gatherings sort..."" need lock again, properly, 2-3 months. flu season coming, slaughter. Probably comparable many reasons here's others say: 

""There reason believe U.S. would better following Sweden’s strategy—unless believe maintaining normal social life would worth tens thousands additional I’m still calling fascist... what’s point? actually precaution. guarantee comes Trump’s “return White House” reality actually “we turned White House hospital”. Or, unsuccessful vaccine trial, could *on* drug *still* ""severe"" case. Either way, sort consolation, would equate something like checking ""organ donor"" box id/license - ideal comes fruition, better checking it.

Such regulation (hypothetically) one UK's ""we infect virus see happens"" trials would much different story... go online buy fresh N95s right now.

Where? Nope. Treatment options getting better, mean Drs venting people ""too early"" start. Recall ask March/April stay home even sick seek medical treatment catastrophically ill. ""Go hospital need help breath."" going lead ideal outcomes. ""saving beds"" highly progressed disease, recent developments shown steroids, clot prevention, treatments helpful given appropriate time. March/April treatments widely used, often time someone saw Dr past point treatments would helpful.

Good news, IFR going treatments better. CFR going part also know infections occurring. Recall March/April tearing nursing homes, hopefully better equipped prevent, identify, isolate cases. people access tests unless already presenting major symptoms, many died even got positive test result.

I wonder million tests day, many done preventatively? NBA, NFL, hell look white house to. Using hundreds thousands tests testing collection people excuse taking preventative measures. Running million tests day supposed we're using sports stars politicians instead using legitimately contact trace isolate amongst public. difference follow one know. follow political accounts run exactly 0 politics people arguing. run misinformation one Twitter talking it. hobby stuff. You’re idiot We're getting started 400k... tending millions deaths end sight. Sounds like state based actor sowing sort stuff. Like Russian botfarms creating divisions rival countries. unironically. 

Unless think ok billionaires go 40% richer pandemic basically everyone else lost jobs. life-saving medicine leave bankrupt US. 

'cause that's capitalism you.  love every country theory, completely ignores rest world infections. surprised majority covid deniers never left country ***”... earlier stages pandemic.”***

in crowing people read headline think Fauci means anytime future. 

Since least mid-summer Fauci continually said US won’t need lockdowns; pandemic guidelines suffice. (Of course work best people follow them.) No, third voters, every person America. got 62 million votes 2016, Clinton got 3 million more. He'll get far less time, fair election. would studios spend billions acquiring theaters? mean, circle round too. question worded poorly. Factory farming horrible. Good quality meat healthiest food though. Hopefully figure fair, many followers bots cannot contract Covid be, made point far to. might find articles handful people there, found anything searches would panic me.

Months ago people thought haircuts perfect place spread virus, looking back seems bit dramatic. Hahhahahahaa. Sweden lower population Karen’s honestly believe there’s nothing learned make difference US. leader largest single source COVID misinformation world. think we're taking things seriously leadership large segment society follows not. There's nothing wrong following subs learning own. difficult. need listen every piece advice, use ability think little bit learn right you. want die virus.

But right, statistical odds means likely gets them, simply due sheer number infected, blatant disregard recommendations continued spread among themselves.

My heart goes staff White House, interns GOP, others simply trying job make living got caught crossfire idiocy, especially Secret Service literally choice. probably cull wild animal population we're it, knows carry. Still refuses wear mask. Bet ya.

Love fauci!! guess we'll keep watch next several weeks incremental upticks past 2-3 weeks. that, constant decline. suppose wondering nobody discussing point, increases incremental best (0.2 percentage points higher positivity rate low... really enough attribute anything significant). point kinda looks like we're looking relatively regional outbreaks. suppose we'll see. However sample decline mid July late September outweighs minute uptick past weeks most. logic, Facebook perfectly fine, following wrong people. 

Go sit corner think you’ve said. think preliminary research viral loads huge play this. Front line workers getting WAY higher amounts virus get infected around 24/7, often leads much complications higher rates death. masks important, wearing one still get system, helps minimize viral load, could lead minimal symptoms. Cool, unplug him, shove street treat someone worth saving Nope.... know left like facts, are. That’s definition stupid.  South Korea does, quarantine every visitor regardless come from? think excessive travel restrictions unintended consequence COVID cases counted. makes Pence look like potential spreader. likely is.

The reason I'd believe that's possible research spreading sort thing counter global warming sixties. anything close ""kill humans"" fucking ridiculous paranoid. There'd beneficial reason, unless believe government lizard people trying take planet. Exactly. Aerosols float air currents go around way reduce spread infected aerosols.

Masks important, way reduce spread. Ventilation also extremely important, superspreader events indoors rather outdoors. spread virus really driven superspreader events 3 factors come together: 1) large number people indoor venue poor ventilation, aerosols accumulate air instead getting dispersed plenty potential hosts virus spread to; 2) masks, barrier aerosols getting emitted someone happens virus; 3) activities increase rate aerosols emitted, like talking loudly yelling (crowded bars), breathing heavily (gyms), singing. handful adverse events seen reported publicly. ADE issue, would disclosed studies paused. saying give let wear? universe rule make sense all? Sounds like non-rule me.

Wear anyway. Like President U.S.

Democrats invented Covid-19 make Trump look bad. They're white supremacists, fuck em. knew, oh wait scientists urging federal administration take action hobbled. I’ve seen plexiglass barriers go everywhere stores, schools, etc. evidence actually work? I’ve seen bunch CDC guidelines suggesting them, get theory, couldn’t find studies supporting it. seems likely could sufficiently disrupt air exchange way allows viral particles linger. wouldn’t first time plexiglass device intended reduce risk [actually significantly increased Sure, that's common response. vast majority consumption-based illnesses associated meat-eating (and count fish understand lumped meat like lamb beef that).

""keep information quality high keep subreddit reliable source information""  Really? sub reddit thinks Covid killed Americans Wars since WWI?  Subreddit lost credibility long time ago. today another example.  least article direct quote source. blatantly untrue like lot posts here. city small outbreak tied gym, staff. sure patrons got staff working infectious without masks. must troll. report ""Humane Society International."" little research upvoting. basically paper-pushing charity came ""report."" find kind sad PR stunts make front page almost questioning supports argument sub's groupthink. 

I'm defending factory farming downplaying COVID way. I'm saying PR stunt guys ate like sheep. main motivation new boss 2021. science here. Thoroughly agree first paragraph. felt implied (ie can't squash something - try). understand issue word squashed used approach itself. One definition/synonym squash like ""suppress"" that's type use - mean necessarily permanently gone. go back silly analogy - first homeowner reasonably refer infestation squashed/suppressed, even though issues rages elsewhere? case wish everybody good luck done trying prevent spread. I'll once, keeping 2020, new virus comes roll dice see dies doesn't. Losers. state calls scoreboard. Thanks boss compliment work doing. Didnt much, asked questions guess times anti intellectualism misinformation that's unfortunately. vegetarian vegan?

I'd assume dietary reasons rather good animals? I’m way saying never said I’m superior anyone. I’m saying everyone isn’t currently vegan superior right ;) What? think moment. Wearing mask, social distancing, well ventilated area, conscious around following guidelines... they're 12 mean can't leave house. Honestly point disconnect let die done need species/society... mean seriously... Wtf I'm sure downvoted, valid question. think things, I'd glad view challenged:

2. Decrease screenings cancer health issues 

3. Increase poverty 

4. Decrease child education (this one feels like stretch, think non-negligible effect) people article Israelis, sooooooooo... mean might Individual 1?

Two mid parts:
Australia considered rollout coronavirus vaccine sooner mid-2021 best-case scenario pandemic planning would save economy tens billions dollars, treasurer said Wednesday.

The Treasury Health Departments developed economic modelling based assumption vaccine would widely available Australia toward end next year, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said. Given that, seems little moot say ""secession treason"" case - think? *Coronald DeathSentence always find contrarian scientists. That's cigarrete companies got away long. yes, obviously not. They’re difficult time consuming manufacture. again, covid19 testing kits reagents March. since found better faster ways mass produce those, anyone get tested. may take time, antibody drugs attainable months go on. ""better that"" bring back hundreds thousands dead directly contributed to? We've staved worst, fear we've darndest set worst possible collision course coronavirus flu season. think sunbelt states right idea.

Not mention, Portland economy can't survive like much longer without bailout. Portland techie city everyone work home, service industry big part economy, bars/restaurants going barely hanging on.  .. what? did, absolutely right. This. Im sure many quick offer sympathies. aides staffers forced presence? Sure. ones chose flout guidelines hurt others? Sorry, no. Thanks, Donald. Far less Americans ""exposed"" wars virus, yes. I’ve telling people beginning. Agencies journalists grabbed “six foot rule” way somehow work around situation, never scientifically agreed upon - scientists actually tell depends much environment. indoors without decent air flow, *no thing* safe distance unprotected people.

Masks simply mandatory times indoors. It’s way even slightly curb transmission. Canine influenza different human influenza.  history written winners, huh flat incorrect. really depends math

oldest event topic mentions World War I

""coronavirus killed Americans Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan World War combined"", yet Americans killed people Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan World War coronavirus killed Americans US.

leave World War aside, world war all

but rest American imperialist aggressions

so rhetorical question Americans deserve empathy people Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan? rest world?  course choice covid. want get infected, stay inside completely isolate people. mean rest us should. feel like really compelling way put thread perspective, people saying that's works, wrong, etc. mean seceded, they? dude's point completely valid. still killed tons iraqis SARS-1 much higher rate severe disease much higher IFR/CFR.

Its fair comparison.

20% old hospitalization numbers testing sickest people. much lower now.

Basically stats totally nonsensical made up.

Not saying negatively effect economy, c'mon, that's fear mongering nonsense posted above.  Look prisons Lol mid January, said China found instances person-to-person transmission lot early confusion virus, thus hand sanitizer shortages (even though way less likely get virus touch vs air).

The west definitely dropped fuckin ball, though. go doc's office tell need booster shot get always keep date. Never side effects tetanus shots good like 10 years think. guy said flat false said ""most"". assumed ""most"" meant majority. Feel free correct bold assumption part. Yes, grandparents dying covid alright long go ABHORRENT usage masks wish could read I'm assuming end day.. America's fault individual countries around world forced grapple this. count American side? would say could say Americans became nation. is, North fought keep Americans, won. wear masks Sweden mook.

Oh, 100% also shooting drones. well tensions rising North Korea meeting, real answers after. idea wars small body count honest Lockdowns 2 3 weeks put breaks spread.  adequate, quick testing, cases identified people stay isolated without spreading. Everyone else masks spread slipped cracks close done. Well Syria main slogan pro regime fighters civil war ""Assad burn country"". Trump delaying election he's basically holding us hostage saying ""Trump burn Country."" going dark winter, see 0 chance guy signs stimulus bill lame duck period. might even force government shut December 11th funding runs pure spite.

Describing China's response Covid. 
Have reached peek Reddit? That's Bingo! Republicans: ""Just like flu"" We'll fucking get there, i'm sure. ""old age"" killed Americans wars viruses put together. mask hide identities cops there's mask-denying republicans there. make traitor then? HANG HIM! HEAD! PUT IRONS THROW GALLOWS! PUT WORK! people downplay death count consider is, new category deaths. Deaths happen, need sit back accept maximum deaths new thing comes up. 200,000 died year nothing done virus, expect next year. Virus mutate. busy collective thumb US's ass done anything covid another new thing shows knocks another 200,000 annual basis? draw line say, ""Let's see use human intelligence manage issue."" death toll unacceptable long something done prevent deaths. okay death toll, hopefully become one statistics way people care human life become people left. literally seceded Union became nation. yes. Fuck them, Americans. article states links rules concerning Covid restrictions including park closure included mentioned email.

He may opened links read rules ... have. I'll revise, sold pesticides (along biological agents) certainly knew going used chemical weapons Saddam perpetrated Halabja chemical attack closing days Iraq-Iran war. 
 
Edit: Disagree reality want, happened. What? I’m defending math.

Where get defending confederacy from? Right now? Really sad, live side country. going visit summer, Covid happened. seen person 2 years. Funny skip right geographic isolation. really think _nothing_ it? Fuck that. fighting south poor, uneducated farmers barely knew dick hole ground. illiterate promised months adventure money seen lives 1% slave owners, already desperate something pitiful farmlife had. used lied wealthy 1% time. Get history check. Time time again, black vs white, rich vs poor. Apparently implies something /y/BiologyJ like. Can't point facts sub, anything say either narrative. try start shit though? remember kind boat thing happening middle east  Well yeah, conditions broadly different compared then. Back then, literally tossed shit streets everyone spit everywhere. Hygiene good people packed together. Healthcare (surprisingly) worse today's america. know airborne then, anyone wear (or know wear) masks way late. Spanish flu also considered deadly actual parallel americas, SF spreads differently hits harder Covid. yeah, today's disinformation crap, making something piss lake compared Spanish Flu almost bad. Hahaha. think Bloomberg made up? evidence points contained zero evidence contrary. Look go! defending confederacy. ancestors would proud. Lost credibility back tweeted people stop buying masks.  something something... SiDeS!!11 20 years ago roommate got bad stomach flu, spread sister I. 24 hour flu, throwing diarrhea. morning after, able get bed, woke find dog thrown 15 times. assume coronavirus spread dog. plausible? TIL, thanks info! guy said flat wrong, said majority slaves Damn casualties really lobsided. dame libs... ok, start. friend, biology teacher continue claim people died flu year COVID-19. I’ve checked sources haven’t found said. I’d appreciate advice matter. won’t break ties them, I’ve seen lot people jump gun comments like these. There's death caused Dr. misdiagnosis, mis-prescribed/ over-prescribed medications, medical mistakes every year, really want anybody know that.. cheer leading ccp me

Your comment history proves otherwise. consistently pro-CCP makes wonder paid way. And, hey, that's case, way get action?

Alas, clearly know enough science statistics hold serious conversation epidemiology. Looking back exchange, seems like I'd trying play chess pigeon. 

SARS-CoV-2 endemic point. amount scrubbing, spray trucks, mask-wearing, hand-washing make go completely away. CCP can't order toddlers wipe noses drool. can, however, insist country virus-free. 0 cases. . . reported bunch authoritarians who've done everything power eradicate meaningful dissent. keep mind lot people nowadays back then. treat absolute numbers grain salt. goes pRotEstS sPreAdiNg cOviD narrative. protests I’ve here, everyone masked up, unlike White House. Dr. Fauci needs say, ""Will shut up, Man!"", better yet, ""Will SHUT FUCK UP, man!"". Sooooo many fascists dude got upset factually correcting *thought* *implied* something like. 

You can't make shit up, internet funny. said it’s flu? didn’t.

And could die tomorrow. could die hour. that’s makes life special. freedom live. wouldn’t want something something COULD happen think frozen way water get wet. lives world. I'm sick her. Look cdc's guidance, indoor transmission real thing. People went restaurants, per trump's CDC, twice likely get infected. Lots outside house behaviors show correlation. I'm guessing difference required wear mask (technically eating, let's real, that's followed).

I feel former-fellow service industry members. Either shitty insurance, owners allowed pay minimum wage, work dangerous environment. OP's theory worse tips could related fact current customers clearly less concerned peoples' health makes ton sense. always felt correlation tip invested topper society. Groups feel alienated discriminated society never tip well, express dissatisfaction keeping money. basically take server. People making lot money, least getting killed cops left right, tip better. alot bars basically acting like restaurant. yes shitty bars open right avoid, take things seriously block tables, bar seating etc like responsible place is. clue one doesnt necessarily mean terrible place say grocery store thought crossed mind before, matches everything we've seen far, i'm pretty confident we'll see exactly that. they'll rush literally drink koolaid. waiting people don’t believe gravity take douchey countries. know ones: America, Israel, Brazil, Russia, China, Hungary, Turkey...

Then ask jump cliff prove purity libtards. Time Die scheduled release April 2020, postponed worldwide twice due COVID-19 pandemic. scheduled release 2 April 2021. Well shucky ducky. Believe science!!!

Wait, science!!! Response ""oh ok, need medical devices helping breathe guess"" rip em iut dump dude ditch. Wasnt worth keeping around anyway. bet dreaming empty beach family. mean yeah, rich country, go lockdown, poor countries supposed do? even third world, I'm talking eastern european countries too. Basically anywhere outside western europe, governments means support people bussiness lockdown. lot reading experience ask serious question. brand beef US prefer want cook nice juicy rib-eye? think bullshit, caused getting way Scot-free. 

And no, I'm even American. Aw Corpse666, that's wholesome. :) Future? That's litterally got pandemic.  

It's possible thought rhetoric Trump aides that, rhetoric, got tested regularly avoided mixing much inside WH. Christie outside campaign advisor hanging WH every day. Well jokes turns leader free world really practicing dumbass rhetoric reap sow.... irony shouting Jewish lives matter burning thing may keep alive pandemic. Religion root evil Racism would like word... think hospitals special beds people size, need two. Social media general absolute cancer society. actually think coincidence Trump's rise power coincided explosion widespread widely adopted social media, especially demographic actually votes (old people).

I'm still Reddit obviously desktop version, social media I've deleted pretty wonderful mental health. definitely improve Jewish image United States around world People realise investors hate uncertainty raging epidemic brings. countries demonstrated robust control get funding buy countries cases soaring impairing business valuation.

I'm discounting NZ's hard earned success, massive 1.5 billion person country. level difficulty suppressing virus China exponentially difficult NZ pretty much anywhere world. 

I family China, assure propaganda, eating out, going movies, travelling like pre-pandemic. wear masks time GASP tested regularly free government. No, I’m saying people use “protest” loophole reckless indoor super spreading gatherings aren’t actually protesting valid shit shut down. could make sure protests real fake socially distanced wearing masks outside it’s longer risky activity locked down. 

What’s better alternative? Don’t lock tons dead? Lock don’t allow protesting police government get away horrible things unchallenged?  happened half year ago posted least twice weird visited northern Wisconsin summer every place went required mask wearing. Twitter really bad people make be, imo. like reddit - filter want want see following certain accounts, mute words accounts. Yeah users toxic, like... every social media? grow thick skin block idiots. Sure. 1% do. really veganism insects you, carnivorism rich. Humankind far stupid exist. personally get sick injured still cling shit-for-brains idea? Unless frozen, steam. look angle.

Yet US gov big wigs ~$7b subsidies feeder corn. whole thing propped money farmers. industries fine it. Look colorectal cancer rates. Big business.  US gov said years ago eating cows causes cancer. not. not. Everyone live UK. bad US government's response disappointing. Interesting ""they brought virus world"" countries handled easy enough others devolved complete chaos incompetent are. Global pandemics thing happen, US knew since November yet nothing prepare take steps early stop it. Blaming China instead inept government gets tiring. fact one person knows thing like point greater conspiracy. Tbh, really don’t need high compliance Covid vaccine see results. elderly, risk, healthcare workers get vaccinated, that’s probably 80% crisis taken care believe Trump real sociopath psychopath. seems much pathologic narcissist (narcissistic personality disorder). mean less harmful, get wrong. different shade 'evil'. GOP government. I’m saying don’t things, like “let stop throw virgins volcano.” don’t think it’s unreasonable ask study send every plexiglass salesman America Hawaii next year. seriously? aliexpress... ordered 100 $50... kn95. surgical masks you’d pay 8-12 cents per each... scared it! /s Nobody wear Sweden mook. ask Swedes thread they'll tell you. count number people wear one hand say. yourself. Where's mass death that's supposed accompany kind behavior? living like America wrong Sweden not? lost mind, baby. see rarely days Paris...maybe twice week compared every 5 minutes. Yeah I'm trying lose weight watch videos make hungry. Everyone knows cases recorded, estimates 2 10 times test positive. results shown US governmental agencies well respected studies Europe elsewhere. Deaths also slightly underreported - likely range 20% under. true number obviously less 1%. must know literally nothing mental illness. 400k die. would assume cares people? could also eat beans lentils stuff instead, currently lot cheaper beef. killed 200k USA alone, within span months.

You may survive face months, years even lifetime health complications caused it: idiotic thinking Corona like common flu, isn't. that. people don't. still make difference use hand sanitizer. think doctors deserve even more..but ya well weight need bed?

... asking friend? It’s hilarious that’s every anti lockdown persons “ultimate” response. LoL kEEp cOweRinG!” soon presented actual facts. 


This article decent job explaining exactly small percentage people’s opinion become mainstream science: Even everyone got tested regularly schedule, still would failed eventually. plan ran assumption tests 100% accurate detect virus immediately infection, takes one false negative ruin everything comes population statistics, using flat numbers instead per capital numbers anti-science.  Smashmouth!! 1918 Pandemic (Spanish Flu) believed started chicken farm Kansas. cause 1917 pandemic... What’s point? People share views un-American clueless drones.

Dude computer engineer.. Good point! I've added Cain's hospitalization date comment. Ah. see coming now. I'd imagine account would considered part estate, they'd refuse let go, since used revenue generator marketing. true, - medical end versus cultural end pandemic. say, cultural end tied directly people deciding longer care. Ironic people hasten cultural end, yet prolong medical end. Chris Christie nothing bully, narcissism hell drug. accept dies wrong - baron wearing goggles street people like aptly aimed anus spreading covid ""life short"" foolery! Unless eugenics take sensible precautions thing wipes care homes health workers. Oh know....maybe could contract spread others spread others might die. first semblance human empathy understand simple epidemological idea.

I'm sure also super concerned contracting spreading contagious diseases, like norovirus. Wow look go !

I hate say sort stuff gives anti-lockdown “skeptics” lot ammunition. 

What say point ? testing ? enough testing back March ? Deaths down? People aren’t wearing masks ?  Yes. It’s returning theme Christie get fucked trying help Trump I'm saying sensible person want person. good paper, practically doesn’t work, fringe group means mainstream science  Potato potato.

GOP never recover this.  could misreading, think original post directly speaking Covid desperation. people different areas live family neighbors not? Berlin bars, cafes restaurants need close 11 pm 6 every day, fear enough. would reduce human population that. beyond me.  first time completely shocked someone’s belief (who isn’t religious cult). No, right, that's mistake.

My ancestors left Kingdom England 1600's time declared independence 1770's, become Great Britain. actually think language opposite - makes people scared. Hearing ""no known heath conditions"" scary. headlines said ""high blood pressure"", ""obese"", ""COPD"", etc., healthy person 30s like may conclude risk known conditions. idk y’all acting like started working vaccine yesterday.

there’s data show effective are.

like another commenter said, tested oxford one monkeys. exposed extremely high viral load, higher average person would encounter, think 3/6 got infected none ones got infected developed pneumonia. 

that’s pretty effective. humanitarian standpoint, idiots opposing masks, claiming COVID-19 hoax, endanger people's lives, include healthcare workers. ""personal freedom responsibility"", cause problems due negligence (not wearing mask getting sick), run ER seek help.We months month pandemic, idiots. think point people indicated IDs, like organ donation, whether agree co comply CDC regulations wear masks social distance prevent spread virus, wanna ""their freedom"". latter, would admitted hospital diagnosed COVID-19. 
A personal story, friend (mid 30's) says virus big deal, risk wants schools open wants normal life, responsibility people risk stay home. asked her, ""If feel problem, would sign declaration case kids get sick, admitted hospital""? response ""Oh, c'mon"". 
End rant. Whenever someone compares yearly deaths due flu existing number COVID-19 deaths, never pointed yearly flu death number 60-100k many people die **without restrictions daily life!**

COVID-19 killed 200k+ US *even though* we're taking extreme precautions. to, suggested, treat coronavirus seasonal flu, think fatality numbers would look like? Sure, absolutely help him.

Just aware roles reversed he'd likely leave die there.

Don't Neville Chamberlain let Hitler walk later all.  compassionate gullible nature scorpions we're frogs. literally post saying FHM (ie Tegnell) fucked start. criticism lot people here.

Where fuck anger tho? Like Swedes streets, Tegnell shouldnt able walk outside cause would get attacked instantly. arent seeing that? swedes acting like minor booboo start willfull fuckup many warned caused death thousands?

Its gross. Swedes gross. 11 hours left debate, he’s cutting close he’s going announce [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Trump going burn country ground gives presidency. don’t advocate lockdowns anywhere article. Neither it’s worth. that's vision hell never thought Hospitals get money person dies covid. fact, well lose money (and have) Medicare Value-based Care Program incentivizes hospitals keep people alive. Furthermore, Medicare patients would incentivized treatment (because expensive treat covid-19 Medicare patients hospital...they must hospitalized reimbursement). non-Medicare insurance, there's reimbursement. simply true.

Not even close.

You see full policy reliable information [the lose credibility. Slavery ""deemed illegal"" passage 14th amendment...three years war. Even emancipation proclamation, essentially executive order ending practice, happen two years war.

They decide secede America slavery deemed illegal; time, still sharp divide people believed everyone American people viewed state nationality. truth, Americans fighting Americans, would overwhelming amount soldiers saying ""I'm Pennsylvanian fighting Georgian, ""I'm Mississipian fighting Ohioan"". Slavery institution nucleus secession movement, whether personal economic stakes (plantation owners), racism (many commonfolk), cultural identity (also still racism here, important recognize difference given period time we're talking about), whole ""states rights"" thing issue actually fought over.

You obviously actually know history time period, start spouting hardline opinions like ""CSA soldiers traitors"", fail realize following one primary tenets historical method: cannot judge people past lens present. good point, people don’t receive level treatment rest us it’s right it’s fair form human decency gone ignored like reports stockpiling PPE ventilators. I´m really sad happening Poland, first wave already overwhelming there. English people allot English people voted Brexit hate brown people voted Boris Johnson because...well fuck knows actually. Guy track record corruption. Unfortunate UK seen rise nationalist, populist politics. England seen rise far right demonising anything liberal left, Wales somehow managed stave Scotland interesting one side Pro UK lobby weird nationalist party far right super nationalist wrong despite string scandals. dude millions going die. i'd recommend getting echo chamber actually look data. HIT remotely close 70%.  


you still answer question. whats sweden? Imagine American right now. Ugh. agenda use Sweden political bat argue lockdowns etc. countries.

And case 22 agenda make famous hide mistakes. r/iamvertsmart Thanks, edited comment official numbers department defense. deadly virus Spanish flu was. Can’t imagine destructive would’ve today’s age. strange notion ""equal"" tbh shit argument. know lewdness laws right?? Stop disingenuous bullshit. You’re making look ignorant. us don’t ear processed food y'all mad Trey, do? see anyone cheering tegnell here. criticising 22 jokers. also said new study showed combining LY-CoV555 another antibody reduced viral load, symptoms hospitalizations Covid-19 patients, compared placebo. rate Covid-19-related hospitalization emergency-room visits 0.9% among received combination therapy, compared 5.8% placebo group. 

It LY-CoV555 submitted EUA, however data combination antibody therapy seems promising surface (of course without sample sizes impossible evaluate further).

Reducing viral load, symptoms severity huge advances disease limited options treat.

For curious, dozen Phase III trials [47 current therapies tracked via Looking forward hearing good news soon Ph III studies. America, ""rest world"" make plant based meat, even lab grown meat (though best option) cheap dead animal meat right now, maybe becomes feasible. gotta make mcdonalds keep big mac ingredient lists undisclosed (which definitely worse since 1955). isn’t fucking true. sub brain dead. even slightest bit research. I’m getting vaccinated.... don’t think people should. 8 billion? real problem many European countries. “I endangered also might killed many people stupidity. Oops, bad.”

Yea, true responsibility. Commendable. sure affected past nimcompoops oh thankful “bravery”. huge news
Basically reduces hospitalization emergency room visits 5.8% placebo 0.9% drug cocktail.

Would theory make closer flu?
If made available doctors asap, would save many lives Ok hurt feelings snowflake. pretty fucking hillarious aint it.

Swedes beyond saving man. brainwashing actually destroyed them. Yeah resign able anything. IE know boss something illegal can't stop it, resign anywhere part it. comes asked something wrong instead saying no, resigning weak way out. Can't argue that. Don’t try think anything people commen sense it’ll give headache. It’s course odd whatever reason people either don’t think it’s bad whatever Trump tells them, I’ve tried use logic reasoning it’s futile unfortunately secession legal process involve explosives

Not United States, isn't. think uses many different examples Sweden performed poorly. true. Maybe different paragraph you’d happier ? Placer County open. Many schools SF San Diego open. Easily googled. name few. calling people FHM ""talentless"".

What part wrong? HIV major virus. Polio major virus. comparatively minor. ""So here?"" again, relevant person responded nearly every first world country handling much better?  true universities. Sure high school 100% this, problem, universities basic memorization. lmao actual fake news Can't RW fucks utter single sentence without lying? completely destroyed conservatism politics nation. hard imagine kind person continuing make choice continue overeat situation.
It would suggest serious underlying mental health conditions, inability discern reality major symptom.. This. Also many times people suddenly close, outside.. ATM example. Nah, would Dollar Cost Averaged S&amp;P500 heck even cryptos would got similar returns. anyone knows positive testing rate? people tired morons prolonging event.

That's real doom gloom. previously noted, clearly stated originally, discussing US deaths. used false argument, counting deaths WWII could compare US deaths.

Fish barrel? even ammo, son...  amount brainwashing Sweden horrifying. came rather early stuff could survive quite objects outside human body. sure anyone ever thought survive passed 6 ft. Hey, topic, correct pronounciation name Ben-ya-min Ben-ja-min? Spain Belgium done appalling job too. change fact US handled atrociously wrong. Again, 200+ countries done better job US. comparison bigger.
 
Without mentioning countries, think US done good job handling Coronavirus pandemic? want accuracy, secession legal process involve explosives.

If want accuracy Come on, really? hard wear single extra item clothing default? anything make sense, repeatedly removing putting back mask anything involving around people indoors, know *does* spread. much easier leave going forget it? fuss really pathetic. worst sub. 3.5k upvotes Thanks china Lol wonder many people believe bullshit millions confirmed cases many twice? people died war co-morbidities going war. don’t count. don’t worry.

-republicans. mean people wear masks everything else before? sure understood correctly. really steep increase, Nepal Myanmar. well first wave. think appropriate analysis would measuring proportion recovered cases suffering COVID related side effects say 3, 6, 12 months onset symptoms/COVID diagnosis, debunk whole comparing COVID flu argument shed light side effects rather deaths alone proven significant. Eh, US dealing surplus deer boar right due declining wolf populations. Might actually good thing, ""bushmeat"" actually healthier factory farmed stuff. Leaner, better ratio fatty acids, that. Mine doesnt allow food good reasons. Hello sir. Please help, cure illness? Looks horrendous! obviously understand exponential growth works. Sad.  think largely function democracies though. notion educated opinion ignorant position totally equal. 

In fact US even equal, rural voters tend less educated power educated urban voters. Imagine last week's debate audio/visual lag thrown mix, lol one thing, death toll rising, that's something happy about. cost money, add millions tons non recyclable (in fact, toxic) waste planet already crisis that. Pfizer stated may end month. Trump wrong timeline trying take credit something nothing with. That’s great. Hopefully keep up. public school districts area well private ones? kids district, seniors school take SAT’s. One day. ....aaaaaand resulted several cases. Obviously difference high school elementary school, clearly anywhere near ready make sort school opening move. suppose treating COVID patients hospital every day, wee bit jaded view virus. didnt even attempt give fatality rate. appears picked upper end estimates (~10 times amount offical cases covid) used unsubstantiated guess disprove upper range original post based published data medical community. 

But even using scaled cases official deaths fatality rate still 0.3% isnt different 0.5-1% given. Well within uncertainty disease right now.

He didnt touch actual argument made (Covid bad, vaccine less bad). going feels like, already half beginning “population remaining catch it” perspective.

I find unlikely vaccine rolled fast enough change anything within next 7 months this.

Now talking 600k - million die instead 2+ million, yeah, see vaccine helping that. Let eat hydroxychloroquine. think unreasonable think that.

Actually, point, *is* pretty unreasonable think that. rich get richer, poor get poorer Wow, surprise stupid, racist generation people would raise stupid, racist children. That's society got today It’s like lentils, fuck tofu. all. MIL still swears doctors hospitals trying mark everyone Covid get extra money saying Covid patient. even marking people passing Covid died something else like auto accidental cancer mind. 
She cannot reasoned with. surprised hear health outcomes related IQ. dumb box rocks helpful life. Saying ""masks important part"" using example bad Sweden performed among neighbours none mask mandates spring either recently started introducing (and still see increase infections hospitalizations despite it) fit together. Yes, masks important part, information proves that. anything, shows factors much larger importance individual countries. Thanks!  many video games play quarantine qualify nerd immunity? start watching anime could even better made conscious choice pay animal suffering. Hahaha quarantine..

Don't pretend stupid. Trump. Remember, think America “great” right now. Good hear, take care good luck! Related: German data show flights super high risk, 66 infections buses, 8 planes. people.

Tulsa rally Herman Cain attended June 20, that's days added timeline there. diabetic riding Titanic goes water ship sinks, die diabetes hypothermia?

The point flu count many pneumonia, never tested flu. CDC includes pneumonia deaths flu statistic. dad Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia weakened immune system. eventually passed away pneumonia, never flu. would included flu death statistics without ever actually virus. flu count estimate exaggerated encourage people get flu shot. Hong Kong flu, reportedly one worst flu strains last century reported killed 34,000 people. much milder strains supposedly killing 60,000 per year? deaths pneumonia. simply combine one category call influenza/pneumonia deaths. 

Yes, many COVID deaths issues, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, etc. mean COVID kill them. Even survive COVID, high rate lung scarring lasting damage organs associated flu. So, comparing COVID flu make much sense, it? Even H1N1 swine flu infected 60 million Americans killed 14,000. regular flu reported kill 60,000 per year? doesn't. Pneumonia does. reality, COVID many times worse flu H1N1. Remote debate. need fucking room. leave home, vanish you.""

OP literally Chinese people packing Great Wall... Back March supposed go healthcare convention going big name speakers; Trump, Christie A-Rod.

It cancelled due covid, feel like we're final destination scenario trying track speakers.

A-Rod careful. Hypocritcal? Sure. go try bring currently accepted US death toll covid number typical flu deaths US per year r/ NoNewNormal see mean. comment counter circle jerk straw man... barely anyone saying “shut everything forever”.

What people saying acting like virus longer existential threat viable strategy either  Unlikely would made much difference, UK still got slammed covid months ago, last couple months I’ve getting weirdest taste mouth there’s foods I’ve always loved, like red peppers, literally can’t stand taste now.

I'd go several masks one day dont recall ton propaganda style ""news"" stating obvious fact BLM antifa riots super spreader events exposed thousands coast coast... almost seems like media focuses one group making laughable excuses others. definition gaslighting.

LMAO funny thing guys constantly make newchina look bad talking way even realise it.

The funny thing think care negative opinion China. flatter yourself. I'm laugh imbeciles. many awful predictions Western media made turned totally bullshit? Yet still believing every single thing claim China.  editorial powerful:

The  magnitude failure astonishing.

We failed almost every step.

Our current leaders undercut trust science government, causing damage certainly outlast them. Instead relying expertise, administration turned uninformed “opinion leaders” charlatans obscure truth facilitate promulgation outright lies.

Anyone else recklessly squandered lives money way would suffering legal consequences. leaders largely claimed immunity actions. election gives us power render judgment.  like 75% (at least) masks social distancing required. austin act like *is* flu no, arent know supporters.

I absolutely horrified saw video club promoter posted showing happened past weekend, trying advertise get people come club WEEKEND :)  #Natural selection time Maye get care compassion showed people Fort Lee.  


Someone died Bridgegate. don’t care. doesn’t mean they’re stupid simply morals Well read comments you’d see take precautions around high risk wear masks that. personally worried. phone ziplock bag ftw. pay using phone. think it’s simply peer pressure. Trump hates masks I’m sure everyone spineless enough said. It’s national security threat, nation refuses admit it. Same. [Apparently die, GOP takes social media accounts]

I'm English. bright side, still got long way go beat death toll 1918-1922 675,000 estimated. thrilled learn masks one preventions actually worked people actively ignored advice use also. Think like this; Spanish Flu hit like truck killed 675k people.

Compare today, humanity advanced 100 years. Globalisation, huge steps medicine understanding viral diseases, transfer knowledge. knew virus came. could prepared countries prepare. 

But even knowledge had, medical equipment safety measures, america still got hit 200k deaths 6 months. covid hit like spanish flu did, would probably way worse. also willingly lied press spreading misinformation downturn COVID cases summer vacation called ""natural lockdown"" -- apparently also apply European countries able supress virus though policy alone. Seasonality changes behavior definitely affected spread new rates ICU intake peaked April declined rapidly that. currently overwhelming evidence get widely distributed safe effective vaccine within next 12 months. actually wrote witty comeback, realized would disgrace give meaningful reply.  


I ashamed humans illogical um empathetic.  Covid deaths massively inflated war drugs? Brilliant inspiring quote. AFAIK Spanish flu mutation thing never proven, it’s (decently supported) theory. time get vaccine thousands dead. didn't. initiated rolling review intended shorten time required approval submit rolling review vaccines started CHMP evaluating first batches data. continues enough evidence available support formal marketing authorization application,” snl audience? articles stuck April.

What author mention number of Vetenskapsforum COVID-19 members releasing models turned inaccurate. 

For instance Nele Brusselaers released model predicted 96.000 people would die Sweden June current model feasible even released, lead FHM others taking seriously. Joacim Rocklov's model predicted 19.000 50.000 would exchanges Tegnell, Cecilia Söderberg Nauclér estimated IFR 1.7% estimated 10,000 people Stockholm would die definitely a consensus culture Sweden rally around experts effect beginning pandemic, part reason critics dismissed continuously released models plausible time also turned wrong. I believe emails Tegnell someone else discuss Brusselaers' model dismiss low quality. engaging slightly group.

While popular frame paint Swedish strategy failure, think interesting question would be, worse? models inaccurate, Sweden lower excess mortality Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, UK? Exploring seems prudent nations move away suppression strategy towards mitigation strategy. 

Note, think Sweden failed beginning act quickly slightly stricter measures could saved lot lives. lack testing April June embarrassing. People pretty relaxed second half March. now, looking forward, Swedish experience might useful countries trying balance virus mitigation keeping society moving populations healthy regards. think individual level.

Thinking maybe could worded better.  English use interchangeably. bugs shit rest us. nothing flu. Go back work. According [Johns 7.5 million cumulative cases US.

The [US Census states population 330 million.

Percent infected population: 7.5/330 = 2.3%

&amp;#x200B;

Where getting 10% from? would imply 33 million cases. find IFR 0.6% 0.7%? That’s case facility rate though. Absolutely one believes true fatality rate Covid anywhere even close CFR. 100% certain point. I'm history buff all. Honestly, really know more. saw headline like, ""wait, what? way!"" computer engineer known pre-existing health issues apart high blood pressure. 

Which among top risk factors severe covid.

Also, seems quite ignorant, huge risk factor contracting virus. mean, we've seen Covid hospital / patient reports countries world, kinds media, starting early year. Yet still believed, August, politics virus exist. Surely dumb, since he's engineer, he's willingly ignorant. nobody blame maybe wife enabled shared ignorance. Everyone focuses safety (which important obviously) also question efficacy. going give vaccine millions people immediately going say ""Woohoo, I'm immune now."" stop wearing masks, stop practicing social distancing, go lives pre-March. better pretty good idea level immunity conferred, whether protects mild severe forms disease, whether varies based patient age factors, approximately long lasts. so?

Good luck pal. median age death covid 80, also happens right around average American life expectancy well, yeah that’s appropriate age die. I’d completely fine dying 80 I’m still somehow alive 90s someone please unplug me. act like it’s people 40s 50s keeling covid droves. age 70+ fatality rate around 5%. younger get less lethal is, point young people likely struck lightning die covid. isn’t say go around coughing people like moron ignore social distancing masking crowded areas, media fear mongering around lethality virus absolute garbage.

Veto power means Senate enough votes override veto issued president. Senate veto bills, closest come holding vote. 

There would need stimulus bill veto proof Democratic president Democratic House Senate pass one, bill needs pass majority. Republicans would hold veto power Dems controlled three voted bills wanted. agree absolutely crazy, think underestimate supply chain logistics potential federal government military. US successfully able mobilize almost 20 million troops halfway across world 1945 even radio communications so/so.


This assuming sides able come together short months work together... maybe high hopes.   Americans go war lot. parents chose homeschool United States even to. [Phil Donahue interviews John Holt viable alternatives Zoomschool think box. Florida hates too. Black Friday coming. would nice Senate house would go ahead pass stimulus bill includes stuff agree on, continue negotiations stuff don't. Something better nothing. Stay safe, buddy. nice seeing timeline laid like that. course estimate, helpful know 2021 could go somewhat plan lives. friends (or hell, personally) shorted everything market, they're burning collect. really like comment upvoted. Someone respect really hopes Trump relatively unscathed. cares Trump, wants Trump soundly defeated Black Americans, Hispanics, others Trump badmouthed made feel like second class citizens see America reject views. Trump dying office martyr, reason supporters come back 4 8 years behind someone worse. (Impossible? said Bush Jr).

Because wants racists nazis beaten millions votes scuttle back holes. wants Republican politicians see Trump get smashed badly remember decades. ""You may tempted pander certain element, open kiss political career goodbye.""

I agree him. Clearly need everyone vote. election matter state solid blue ruby red, vote anyway send message. Biden gets 35% vote West Virginia would huge rebuke Trump, state 68-26. New York, California, sure Biden win, vote chance run score. want Trump losing 5 million votes start counting West Coast.

Please vote, election vote whole life, follow kpop kids' lead humiliate Trump. little progressive though.  call bullshit that. Small town close urbanized area here, seeing least 2 white women one white man maskless running around small town, tho halfassedly social distancing.  Classify however want that's still people's lives could unnecessarily lost. I'd hope government dismiss lives Americans ""Darwinism action."" brain dedicate many cells talking thinking? paperwork would hospital ever need that? hospital ever needed non-medical professional ""sign off"" patient's cause death? people tell patient died hospital. hospital needs random person's opinion medical fact. wanted fake covid death, could entirely themselves, without significant medical training. confront people masks. also patronize bars right now.  worries. wanted make sure missing someone :) Can't eat mask on, makes restaurants problem. sucks industry could destroyed, I'd rather see restaurants go lives lost. confront people masks. also patronize bars right now. f'n way he's faking it. Humanity whole even notice virus. Despite pandemic 60 million people planet January.  Covid suffering pointless, though. would rather criminals suffer jails hospitals. regardless intent, important doctrine law called eggshell doctrine. agree maliciously towards someone get hurt expect get reduce punishment fragile. action caused die. America cases India much high-risk population heard Flint still shit water. I'm pretty sure hiding previous test results able go first debate.  would net benefit humanity tbh doesn’t matter does, somehow it’s Nancy Pelosi’s fault. kid not, conservative relatives told today. tried figure exactly halted crucial process Trump one tweeting literally it, kept screaming trying ram “pork” actually trying help anyone I’m brainwashed. reasoning people. give up. Yet didn’t send source advocating “full lockdowns again” ?? missing something?

Right now, trying would end well. love bless heart ending. Killing cancer make chemo less unpleasant. Like said wear mask mean enjoy it. wonder many 3K deaths data dumps (such one last week) see future. 

I highly doubt 360 people died today many cases high positivity rate. No, not. electoral college stacked us. stupidity much easier wield intelligence is, average would make think so. he's advocating full lockdowns while, frankly hard get read precisely wants consistent thing seems declarations like this. Deaths following infections 5-6 weeks. Crazy coincidence governor lift restrictions 4 weeks prior election day. HA lying president....

How anybody support him? He's disgusting repugnant every way. Well, explains girlfriend left you. white house doctor announced 95% ox made severe definition believing got money's worth Yes Stephen Miller. Thanks correction. Im socially isolating years end .13% mortality rate, suck buttercup. could also say COVID-19 killed Trump's presidency influenza even though influenza three year head start. someone go whole rescheduled wedding thing, contact venue get shit. venue pain ass took time sort out. Trump false claim goes hand hand. many fucking times lie would hilarious hypothetical. Except think 5 days still faster possible. forget every bill needs amendments. wanted guarantee would vote cohorts, it.

P.S. Thanks *nothing*, lying orange pork rind. take approved October 31st would approved November 5th, that's Darwinism action. find article saying “we need hunker get fall winter”.

Where getting wants go back April lockdown levels? Nobody wants go company made distributed Thalidomide idea many college students died covid can't even bothered look up. Quit spreading false information, public disservice. Well, seem ruined San Francisco's public health director, lol.

[Grant Colfax](http://sfbaytimes.com/grant-colfax-former-obama-aids-policymaker-appointed-director-sf-department-public-health/)

[Grant Colfax's sub originally pretty partial, quickly become left leaning room facts debate. Think this. 

- would doctor ever need random person without medical training make decision patient's cause death? 
- would vast majority people expected know exactly hospital patient died? Expected know difference types heart attacks? Types organ failure?
- would happen someone clearly died gunshot wound, person's significant refused sign it?  Hello Vermont! I'm $200K debt indeed endless. Exactly. you’re pro-mask doesn’t mean enjoy it.  thought obvious enough even mildly attractive would grasp mark milley? believe he's quarantining there's news testing positive yet (unless mean stephen miller?) stops people decide stops. Anyone promoting lockdowns selfish. Ex wife friend who's daughter 11 years younger her. Tired wearing mask tired lungs permanently damaged? take tired wearing mask day every day. know time hard tell someone serious, sarcastic, anything between. Everyone runs online, tons skits it... Fucking bullshit many degrees separation someone diabetes/age/asthma etc?

The rate hospitalization 20-45yo also increasing. 

But aside I'm fine paying risk hard quarantine. Yeah expected. think may start seeing large scale vaccinations mid late next year (assuming everything goes well course) yeah 2021 same. Rally's great fast food burger stand! plenty jobs basic benefits. budget, live Japan.

America plenty nice people white. place far worse. many areas better non-whites Japan non-Japanese.

But, USA hating Japan lovers seem love weed even know start.

I'm making point trade crime homelessness smoke weed, that's thing.

Most people act like US hellscape exaggerating basing media actual experience.

The people genuinely argue Japan something US ethno-nationalists. They're nuts, second all, ethnically Japanese, anyway. third all, Japanese culture toxic shaming, abuse, lying rigid gender role. sure homogeneity really bonus make be. killed number civilians USA bombed phantom weapons talking media shows [our benevolent general Albert [hanging [along public [no social distance [more 'Member Peewee Herman masturbating adult theater scandalous? reputable sources say thing - studies shown BLM protests didn’t significantly contribute spread COVID.

It’s fine feel like it’s bullshit pardon don’t value feelings scientific studies credible, funded research incentive lie findings. article, 4 days Market already topped. going rallies time time, big crash imminent.

FUCK So, guess can't say wish death him, statement getting purpose, sure deserve it. Something round without 100% spherical though. think people recognize earth perfect sphere would say doubt round. Well wrong, oblate ellipsoid. Checkmate atheists! Sweden bottom performer. One worst planet. 

(Although grateful idiocracies Brazil US deliberately working hard surpass you.)

Again, odd insist comparing Sweden nations heart Europe hit hard early, ignoring neighbors also periphery continent lock down. 

Oh, no, possibly give credit Norwegians, Danes Finns achieving better outcomes. Let's talk Italy! I've accepted many people country simply give flying fuck anyone household we're going fend ourselves.

Quite seem give fuck anyone household either. think he's worth listening to. I'm still upset lying American people masks never apologizing it. bad bot happens every time I’ve woken opiate overdose. 

“You’re ambulance”
“Why?”
“You OD’d, gave narcan”
“No didn’t, don’t use”
“The needle arm, people CPR, cops kit”
“But don’t use” is. fault poor people born poor parents. Also, world perfect, anyone reach anywhere hard work. 

-Some rich guy born mansion probably know gave Trump Covid? not, even possible? It’s useless plexiglass barriers set cash register stores masks required entrance. nice deflection. 

you can't even give answer that. 

that's okay. 

Mr. ""I'm allowed vote Democrats"" stay whack job.  accurate antibody tests? Back end Jan first week February went work conference major city US. say next team China offices. assumed bad cough cold. full week conference rooms together, whole team got sick, included. BAD COLD 6 weeks, fatigue cough felt like rake begging dragged lungs. fever. tested virus April July, negative. tested antibodies via quest June September, also negative. possible antibody tests perfected yet shite luck bad cold? Hmmm, faith... much ""science"" then! :( No. Haha nice bro! Cheers everything, terms COVID19, I'd trust China USA based current situation. Yes them. Idiots well. regarding article, don’t see relatively prestigious scientific journal would spreading misinformation. don’t think serious misinformation it. understanding FDA authorized Powecom Harley CDC actually tested lab filtration power, feel pretty relatively comfortable. Obviously 3M Moldex probably less risky time want buying people actully need like medical workers. disagree. models (private practice, value based, physician owned, etc) take massive fee service hospitals knees. 

But definitely going revolution hit hurts speak language. That's actually called common sense buddy. know what? wear it. less idiots, better No, KN95 Chinese standard, KF94 closest Korean standard. already infected exposed one massive leap backed much study...

people identified ***long term t-cell immunity***.. exposure covid/sars.

**SARS-CoV-2-specific cell immunity cases COVID-19 SARS, uninfected coronaviruses trigger antibody cell responses infected patients: however, antibody levels appear wane faster cells. SARS-CoV-specific antibodies dropped limit detection within 2 3 whereas SARS-CoV-specific memory cells detected even 11 years sequences selected structural non-structural proteins highly conserved among different coronaviruses (for example, NSP7 NSP13 100% 99% identical, respectively, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV bat-associated investigated whether cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific cells present individuals resolved SARS-CoV, compared responses present individuals recovered SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even one *person's* death much. Fuck's sake. That's super awesome microbiologist offered actually talk people. Now, people still actively denying effects danger Covid - choosing selfish perspective, lack info.  Related;

""""narrative""""?? TRUTH died, many people 20/30s without preconditions die it.  Huh? saying things stop COVID spread meaningful way caused vast differences spread virus countries? think thats it. actions goveremnt foolishly corruptly trying keep things wraps. controlled spread through......which comment about. policies communist countries could implement used control spread? Jailing doctors, journalist, laweres control spread COVID. Also, far heard Vietnam either referring China list? think missing entire point comment though, I'm pro communism, I'm simpley asking explanation (to control spread) able capitalist country? uncle believes it’s political thing &amp; it’ll end election over.

So much “free market” argument lol, sound like sacrifice Thanos willing take sound giddy it. fear mongering crap. sound like Trump voter, come already. strategies sustainable others. maximizing things cause least fatigue, things people comply long term consistent rules. Changing mask rules every two weeks erodes compliance.  wear mask fine. Nobody stopping wearing mask washing hands.

Btw wear mask. like 4 twitter followers think would delete account spread misinformation lmao probably know this, also /r/chordata1 too, want mention anyone using links -- KN95 Chinese standard, KF-94 Korean standard.

If prevalence climbs certain level, spread schools explodes. fair, could spend 100B productively. I'm disagreeing said. 4x protein (200g/day) wrong. like 2x (100g/day actual average US). I'm healthy 200lb+ adult resort whey powder even hit 150g. average person eating 200g  phrase comment like that, shit ominous af ***long term*** t-cell immunity imparted somehow.

3. pollution soil groundwater nitrates excrete animals
4. use antibiotics creating multi resistant germs
5. well animals hear you. Thing is, live interact health fragile people (heart issues), could potentially die it. guess I'll stuck vaccine comes along.. you? people's bad behavior justify bad behavior. reading book Nemesis years ago. elements story regarding perspective poliovirus true. going people disregard sinks in. disagreements all. stating obvious seems effect everyone differently.

Natural != good ambassador US saying *could* reach herd immunity Sweden actually strategy achieve it. fact cannot find single instance health authorities Sweden saying they're adopting herd immunity strategy tell untrue narrative is. deaths estimated

But one get funding claiming CoD?

LOLOLOLOL understand. would spell way pronounce way did. happens different we'd pronounce English. No, pointing hypocrisy reasoning. reasonably certain almost trasmission virus random people passing street, demand higher level certainty, have. Neither level certainty masks efficient settings (apart N95, professionally fitted worn, almost nobody general public do), case, enough accept it. can't really ways unless want expose risk someone point hypocrisy you. real!, that's significant amount influence. protecting safety fellow Americans enough many label someone ""traitor"" worked psw long term care provide ppe. allowed use cloth masks, back march/april basically impossible buy, could find them, expensive. barely made enough money pay bills buy food (16 dollars hour Toronto) expected somehow pay 50+ dollars box masks would last maybe 3 4 days used correctly. Here’s great info graph food prices percent disposable income. 

http://wsm.wsu.edu/researcher/WSMaug11_billions.pdf idiots responding crying rich is... advocated for, probably still advocate shitty/unnecessary COVID policies destroyed millions American small businesses. mad thinking poorly. Bezos douche, supposed take free money handed him? goes Supermarket chain owners, Mcdonals (they drive thrus), every rich person got astronomically richer state governments decided react without thinking. Yeah, struggle. Consequently eat day. Yes, totally! hypocrisy absolutely overwhelming. people eat meat realized ingesting.

Though still think plant based meat preferable, lab grown doesn’t eliminate animal exploitation 100% potentially less healthy kinds vegetable meats. guess lab grown meat greatest potential resemble real meat stubborn meat eaters. prevented whole lot deaths. Watching another human suffer ability help makes bad person.

what watching millions people suffer including 200,000 dead people? Yea, that's meant. talking like general, since seeing types comments lot. Fandango already streaming service though? indication MDs good examples, health minded, telling staff eat live, etc. etc. etc. make 5x less dentist afford brand new n95 mask twice day forever. heck. wonder compares drug therapies? anyone know much big deal vs waiting vaccine?  [maybe honestly think GOP collectively delusions grandeur invincibility many things inexplicable gone way past four years. close votes, things they've gotten away with, timely verdicts, justices they've got replace. like seems like gonna fall apart, something goes right saves all, even spins look good base. honestly think they're invincible. I've seen million times people ""running hot,"" sometimes seems like never end. always does. does, really, really bad. Ukraine going long time now. Nobody paying attention. 

It total catastrophe soon. 

And seem intent much it... Also past day white house actually *did* allow standards pass comment incorrect yeah except here's thing:

you dont catch cigarette habit store idiots arent wearing masks

you dont catch alcohol habit idiots arent wearing masks

you dont end warzone idiots arent wearing average age covid deaths US higher avg. life expectancy US.

that absolute LIE.  Thanks lockdowns favored large corporations small businesses. can't get head around causes people believe sort thing hoax bog cover something? thing think people looking control situation can't control. know ""truth"" situation, gives feeling reassurance really know crack is.

Consider Reddit: huge, slithering pool people desperately trying show they're smarter every idiot commenter. Nobody else really *knows* way every commenter thinks know.

Now apply real life.

TL;DR: idiots think we're brilliant. I’m one million—an RN front lines NY first three four months pandemic. Donald Trump downplaying feels like slap face healthcare workers—and especially patients families affected COVID-19. said somebody needs write hand rump. aunt replied across room, totally deadpan, 'he'd able read'. lol racism/socioeconomic two usually go hand-in-hand. dentist given 20masks back March (he change mask per patient) told needed buy own. wonder people wear ones long time. depends important experience. someone wears ear plugs theatres unbearably loud movie found better experience theatre.

I personally don’t get anything extra watching theatre. understand lots people though - think everyone choice. people always opt theatre experience, people always opt home experience. people decide based movie/timing/etc... certainly people hate theatre would otherwise waited movie come streaming opt home release experience instead. seems like movie companies could maximize profit. better person I, would stand watch bleed making sure aware helping. Cool. Great worked you. Doesn’t work everyone. Don’t act like know like it’s easy. research articles because, why? would point funding research. 

We eat restaurants every week. ever pre pandemic. However never eat restaurant maskless closed area safe. could argue eating restaurant outside safe......I would mostly agree. However, don’t take chance. 

I agree one thing. statement disagree. terrible idea, still main issue people wanting sit dark room bad airflow couple hours.

I could see *some* theaters trying partially convert like this, think good idea. know built support it: lot local theaters pretty much build screen exterior building wall. They'd need lot add even crude 'backstage' area. That's measuring snarkiness millennials. Oh dunno.. reading articles sub every day posted time. guess missed them. doctors deserve way amount bs put people probably think countries exist outside theirs. countered package includes money fighter jets. help situation. that's meeting middle allocate large sum money things even close helping situation.   Prepare soaring meat prices then. folks thinking POTUS covid .ess sorted election day, may want hold placing bet. criticizing. You’re right, point still stands, fact stands strongly. million physicians US, include PA’s, NP’s, RN’s, etc several million more. Owners players....Blind leading blind mayhem turmoil. thing know exactly getting Trump. bombastic, fiercely pro-american. Right guy need. Making middle east peace deals pulling troops back alone big enough reason vote him. economic record stellar also exactly need right recover virus.

Biden president nursing home, literally puppet handlers. system 47 years, hell thinks finally figured old senile?

It's bad live country crippled medical debt. Ah, we're simple people.

Those countrymen mine still believe months old ""the flu much worse"" narrative.

I always credited politicians handling pandemic well - dont even know anyone knows someone got sick.

But reading people acutally get still believe little bit discouraging. Plants.  Yeah that’s exactly mean. extrapolate 20-30 years. I’ve reading lot effects 1918-19 pandemic didn’t really talk lot creepy crazy reclusive people 20th century virus damage, reason wasn’t made explicit often. Get ready science deniers. really destroying means human someone explain Tegnell is?

Why hate not? chris christie reek trump campaign, sent fetch citrus mcdonalds. Yes! Emoji Reddit. Love it! 😍 last five years, we’ve seen Russia-friendly governments installed two three nuclear-armed NATO powers, election nearly installed Russia friendly government third. fourth NATO country, non-nuclear heavily armed, also installed pro-Putin government.

We’ve also seen Russian aggression Western borders - including borders NATO countries. 

The thing stopping Putin marching across Europe taking whatever likes NATO, especially nuclear nations. 

If lived Poland Finland right now, I’d scared shitless November 3rd. Well, KellyAnne Conway physical traits heavy smoker. got sick back July  Hospitals near us mass layoffs near bankrupt this.

That sounds.. dirty. heh. story reminds friend whose father raped mom family stood beside “he much us”, “he’s good person, never misses church” “he always looks family”


You look best people that’s admirable trait. please careful.


I don’t know uncle much xenophobe is. “I won’t sit beside person colour” xenophope “if you’re driving town, I’ll block truck point shotgun you” xenophobe. defend actions looks family? I'm Clackamas County, yeah town pretty red anti mask. sucks. Fortunately need go much, though. Sorry, sorry experience masters classes usually much smaller, seldom larger 50 people. clarify further, FHM might that, Socialstyrelsen takes ""cause death: covid-19"" data: 


""\[FHM\] Statistiken visar antalet personer med bekräftad covid-19 som avlidit, oavsett dödsorsak. \[...\] Socialstyrelsen följer antalet avlidna med angiven dödsorsak covid-19."" 


 (""The \[FHM\] statistics show number people confirmed covid-19 died, regardless cause death. \[...\] National Board Health Welfare follows number deceased stated cause death covid-19."")

src: That's exactly sweden, use subway busses everyday get university, swear time i'm one wearing mask. 

Maybe 1 2 people aswell that. crowded subways busses mind you, also case pandemic peak aswell. 90+ people dying everyday.🤦‍♂️  course would. He's desperate.

Trump never suffered life went hungry. GOP. know attacker votes for. Without firing one bullet Every time see Mitch think mountain lion... big cat would work, they're pretty rad... taking bite messed chin/throat thing. medical term thing? Japan South Korea soft lock-downs, high level testing contact tracing, well social awareness follow rules public safety, barely needed effect changes business. Schools closed, mask mandates given, curfews set up, etc. like entire industries collapsed. economies hurting rest world get memo fucked up.

The USA always going get hit hard virus due prevalence ""Muh Freedums"" population, strong leadership would coordinated response earlier mask mandates, better use logistics testing (we *STILL* can't get results back Covid test many areas timely fashion; labs overwhelmed others standing still twiddling thumbs), contact tracing joke, leaders overwhelming ""left local jurisdictions"" want....

It's nightmare.

The day someone argue need wear mask ""because DeSantis said so."" exact words ""We need wear mask anymore, DeSantis said so!"" told private property wants patron he's going wear godamned mask. we? It’s government screwed up. ended lockdown early allow tourists come. Especially Madrid remained closed longer.

The problem tracing all. Gee, that's bad. sure? Actually, number long-lasting/ permanent severe complications, important, hit wide range age group. Unfortunately, cannot calculate yet, tho studies claim happen 10% cases so.

You die covid, chances close zero old enough. living without one lungs may happen many us. campaigning.

hope hicks gets army LEO person, brings prep rose garden, showing symptoms contagious, could've easily spread names list herself.

now person gave became contagious spread realizing it...

now imagine white house testing correctly wearing mask seen liberal...

just matter time single person brought spread around inner sanctum got everyone realizing it.

a simple mask mandate indoors close attendance others would've prevented entire thing. would've stopped hicks spreading much.

just imagine hope hicks decision wear mask thirty minutes brought trump presidency. live denial. good reason terrified. disposable income, keep bag packed ticket Mexico ready (you still fly there, cannot drive in). Mexico, possibly fly safe haven...if let in. trying downplay pandemic whole, claiming killed 0.06% population bullshit claiming hoax. difference people died covid died covid detail often overlooked, especially sub.
My heart could literally stop tommorow found covid positive, would included statistic well. ""I'm still infected steroid antiviral treatment.. Heading back workplace taking mask"".

Yea, real leader got there... fire him! HARAMBE!!!! 40% covid deaths linked nursing homes. Lol what? Deep heart knows big banks evil ruin lives willing shed fabuloso keep floors clean. I'm judging actions, terrible man. He's shining floors people steal homes underprivileged. translators kicked oval office could alone handlers? saying went virus free, failed, took months go virus free again? comment make look worse? took SEVEN. MONTHS.

If Trump admin, hear: ""How could trump allow virus back went virus free? take seven months get point? Trump admin failed us all, despite finally virus free?""

TEE DEE ESS real thing. (I can't even type fucking automod deletes it. HILARIOUS) Worldmeter/coronavirus click usa. look graphic state onset protesters. want, show calculations pearson correlations. dont know dont believe me. Morgan Freeman passed away. Yes, presidents biggest power bully pulpit Trump uses disgusting way. influence politics position influencing American people even doesn’t lot actual power. wastes influence petty grudges, race baiting, disinformation. Better stabbed pen knife year-long land dispute... Ah, see one noticed theory holds together actions decisions seen. trying weaken nation preparation for...? also agree likely buddy Putin. nukes undergo fission entirety. could caused lot damage. Nope. day 2099 new infections. Spanish numbers place. need lok. 7 day average. steadily decreasing new infections.

What much important number hospitalisations ppl ICU. nowhere near numbers summer.

This central government’s fault ending lockdown early allowing tourists country.

Spain needs drastic changes economy. Tourism reliable source anymore.

Legalising weed would create lot tax income. like lied masks. obvious masks would help ulterior motives. Telling thousands thousands people feet away screaming high risk spreading virus joke. really high risk spreading I'm gonna start lot normal life stuff spread I'm sure things I'd like spread either. know fair compare confederate soldiers even confederate citizen happened germany Nazis

I see comparison made. one paragraph talking soldiers, next talking Nazis, examples judging people actions.

I agree that, someone would try compare confederacy Nazi Germany, Nazi Germany would ethically come short. short. Ah yes... let's listen guy named Trey Songz. Dog delete internet China famous collectivism. People taught greater good grew up. Thus almost trouble convincing stay home. 

Western countries known individualism. simply cannot tell people give right. Thus hard copy China did. No! Bad boy!   They're dumb. They're lazy evil. two ways approach virus. approach safe possible approach convenient possible. severe coronavirus convenience syndrome. what's safe convenient interfere things want do. so? Go front page pretty much website, news likely someone something US. one ever said like facts. one single country far powerful military, highest GDP nearly next 10 countries combined, complete control nearly worlds trading, biggest companies come country, pretty obvious people pay much attention happens US. No, people live are. know Germans /Nazis suddenly wake one Jews outcast. clue made think that. months scheming propaganda Nazi party, even failed first attempt outcast Germans simply care enough blame Jews much problems. Hitler took every radio station able broadcast Germany, hatred Jews, Joseph goebbels, head propaganda effective pretty much brainwashing public. Germany fell economic turmoil made alot easier shift blame onto certain ethnicity.

Next article: ""Dr fauci sandwich lunch""
Reddit: OMG love fauci! Go look recent comments. talking people like lolol.

I didnt know English class, thought reddit. also thought original comment ""bad bot"" ""wowwww stupid boy that's even right wtf take down"" lmao  everyone masked up, unlike White House.

legit lol.. funny true! ahaha.. sounds bit silly, might well make restaurants take rules like that. practical plus think many times masks touched hands potentially contaminated. Actually none things write actually written article. don’t know made mistake it’s different what’s written Wow types perfectly. may reading HORRIBLE explaining things. Here's poorman's gold you🏅 US go Autumn Winter, peak flu seasons, people likely shrug cold flu. idea republic is.

Hint: republics electoral college. sub nutshell money come from? massive amounts debt / inflation creating merely printing money? 0 understanding implications cause it’s going lead WAY suffering covid ever going cause. FWIW, data little old believe two college deaths now. true, take press. People don’t need meat! haven’t meat nearly 30 yrs it'll eventually disappear Yes, definitely people call Christian worship money instead Christ. 

There's separation church state reason. Yes, Christians, citizens....we vote see best. However, problem comes people tightly align political party becomes part identity. narrative ""real Christians"" vote Republican XYZ false. People think follow given leader tells do.

It's mess. sad state affairs around. Months?

It decades anti-intellectualism, anti-elitism, anti-science, anti-fact. Clearly You’re welcome! confused first I’d following story months doesn’t deserve anyone’s sympathy. Would anyone even know? Contact tracing pointless infection level US. 7.7 confirmed cases, probably like 40 million infected far. probably can't say certain got it. see restricting movement, economic uncertainty isolation can't damaging mental health.

And death long term organ damage breathing difficulties damaging? would venture guess early voters voting him. many undecided early voters, people know want currently White House. Anyone died virus effects virus died result virus. It’s simple that. would think fairly good indicator. example, laid month covid. drove less 5% normally do, less risk bring accident. ate better time cook, got exercise.  god save stop shoving objects asshole gov taking care wage don’t risk lives working help us keep infections time. WWE AEW wrestling shows similar. Tests shows, 'mask' wearing venue. Take match.

Sounds thrilling, especially people carrying like normal likely end brining virus home vulnerable. Trump contradicts Trump's false claim Covid-19 deadly “This deadly stuff,” adding might five times lethal flu. Trump said, “It’s also deadly – know, your, even strenuous can't believe headlines still repeating garbage without mentioning Woodward tapes. biggest problem term ""critical thinking"" appears redefined ""being critical government/authority"". 

Most people use term ""Sheeple"" think critical thinking means denying mainstream science already proven - claim lack critical thinking skills simply looked evidence, weighed decided YT videos constitute solid evidence... That's ok. even teach modern history school. pretty much 1600s-early 1900s.

You ignoring fact deaths arent inevitable consequences pandemic. Many deaths caused policies implemented fight pandemic, inevitable. counted either. caused virus. landlocked walrus goes ventilator, he's pretty much done for. COVID-19+ Morbid obesity+ asthma? looking good. initial estimates IFR high. 1-5%. first months fact sparse - infection widespread heavily driven public transit. made assessment high lethality low underreport reasonable. 


As testing became available narrative low underreport became less less reasonable. pushed expected fatality rates dramatically. 


Now want point one thing out. current strategies created earlier estimate 1-5%. estimated correct, could expect US likely would suffered deaths moment. idiotic national response was/is, see true. think northeastern United States ever get bad back March/April. know long unmitigated spread lockdowns NE started back mid-March. better testing, I'm hopeful avoid ever getting back situation earlier Spring. can't speak regions though. You’ve actually made argument me. NYC got slammed early on, there’s way deaths going bad, even bump cases Hasidic communities back there.

CA bad summer, hospitalizations way Governor Newsom initiated 4 tier system specifically designed slowly re-open places country prevent cases blowing up.

AZ also bad summer hospitalizations down, along metropolitan areas like Seattle, Portland, Detroit.

Cases hospitalizations spiking WI right places Midwest get hit badly, also lot fewer people regions.

So yeah, want get optimistic, long term, there's working vaccine, assuming fine, might less dangerous flu. like reading news, everytime something horrible Trump comes increases odds Trump winning, increases potential winnings. always there. collects together. 

Exactly. Y'all fucking crazy shit. Serious question, big events people wore masks spread? school articles I've read, point school activities kids take masks hang parties. even then. become? always Possible paywall.... Note, facility run state New Jersey.  

 

EDISON, N.J.—At beginning outbreak would eventually make Menlo Park Veterans Memorial Home one deadliest Covid-19 sites country, workers tried contain virus hanging piece plastic across hall.

The sheet separating virus patients dementia sufferers soon sagged, according interviews photographs. Somebody taped opening, leaving gap makeshift fortifications.

Administrators discouraged use masks, conserving storage closet residents workers sickened, employees said.

The nursing home’s chief executive waited week one resident tested positive alert families, according interviews family members, medical records documents. short-staffed facility placed visibly ill residents rooms healthy ones.

As deaths soared April, administrators tallied way minimized coronavirus toll.

Menlo became uncommonly deadly place midst stubbornly infectious virus. Wall Street Journal analysis available official data suggests Menlo suffered Covid deaths nursing home country.

The dangers shouldn’t surprise. Covid-19 tore Life Care Center Kirkland, Washington state, month Menlo’s first case late March. nursing homes, including Menlo’s sister facility, New Jersey’s Paramus Veterans Memorial Home, also racking cases deaths.

...

 

Kryn Westhoven, spokesman Menlo’s operator, New Jersey Department Military Veterans Affairs, said every nursing home vulnerable, Menlo. veterans agency “made every effort provide resident families status Covid-19 within facility soon possible,” said.

Seven months pandemic, problems persist nation’s senior-care system.

Nearly 25,000 nursing-home residents died Covid since June 1, analysis federal data shows. deaths, came well pandemic’s first national peak April, account nearly third 83,000 overall nursing-home assisted-living facility Covid fatalities recent Journal review state federal data. Journal identified least 26 nursing homes outbreaks claimed 20 patients since beginning June.

State-run veterans homes particularly hard-hit. reasons hard determine precision. Officials say state-government hiring rules low pay made recruiting retaining employees difficult, often leaving facilities short-handed.

Moreover, men died virus higher rates women—and unlike nursing homes, men far outnumber women veterans facilities.

...

 Menlo reported 62 deaths linked virus state officials. 112 residents died reported causes March 31, registered first fatality, end May, records reviewed Journal show. April, 98 residents died. 10 times number died typical months pandemic, earlier records show. 

...

 

To document toll Menlo, Journal turned hundreds emails administrators internal records facility showing deaths, hospitalizations internal transfers. Journal attempted contact families every resident died March May, interviewing dozens family members, staff members surviving residents.

An inspection report state nursing-home regulator first days March foreshadowed Menlo’s losing battle Covid. Among inspectors’ observations: nursing home botched infection-control efforts placing residents posed risk spreading drug-resistant bacterial infections rooms others.

As threat new virus mounted, Mr. Van Lew, state veterans agency official, ordered Menlo Paramus shut outsiders March 12, according letter sent residents’ families.

Around time, Ms. Schiff-Heedles gathered workers one facility's dining rooms discuss virus. Among plans: Set part dementia unit, known “Stars Stripes,” house potential Covid patients.

Several nurses workers asked weren’t given masks wear working patients, four employees present said.

Ms. Schiff-Heedles said agency following state federal guidelines, said Shirley Suddoth-Lewis, licensed practical nurse working facility time.

“We don’t want frighten residents,” Ms. Schiff-Heedles added, according Ms. Lewis, retired August. Others present corroborated Ms. Lewis’s description conversation.

...

 

On March 27, email Ms. Schiff-Heedles, Jared Doherty, lawyer New Jersey veterans agency, described plan discipline workers committed “mask insubordination”—such insisting wearing mask—with punishments ranging warnings suspension, citing guidance governor’s office. Mr. Doherty declined comment.

A spokesman Gov. Phil Murphy, Michael Zhadanovsky, said policy applied state-owned masks employee ever formally disciplined wearing mask. policy, never finalized, meant “ensure consistent reserve masks,” said.

When worker brought note doctor recommending wear mask, manager advised Ms. Schiff-Heedles permit him, balked request.

“If every employee come work doctors note,” wrote Mr. Van Lew March 30. “Not sure good advise \[sic\].”

At time, federal Centers Disease Control Prevention recommended facilities “consider” providing masks health-care workers. March 30, state Department Health recommended universal mask-wearing health facilities, document shows.

.. However, remove CoronaVirus equation, suddenly deaths aren’t there. caused deaths?  flu, car accidents, diabetes, etc kill hundreds thousands every year too. 

Should national days mourning everyday? one problem cutting corners standards already among rigorous world. Extending timeline start deploying vaccine literally cost 10s thousands lives hundreds thousands. needs end meaning makes people feel safe actually much. google term ""security theater"" also examples familiar people **Morgan Wallen Catches Heat Maskless Partying Ahead SNL Performance** Fun fact, part motivation Revolutionary war also slavery, south least. virus called Social Media. sole reason cancer due mutation causing uncontrolled cellular replication.

The sole reason car crash death impact two large objects high speed.

The sole reason drug overdose respiratory suppression leading hypoxia brain death. Okay, sport hear agreeing me. meant suggest means infection every case mentioned covid, fundamental similarity humans commoditizing animals profits consumption unwittingly end transmitting diseases helped propogate ourselves. know exactly future zoonotic diseases look like exactly they'll transmitted, look past present examples understand behaviors toward animals caused continue cause illness. next one could much worse. Good luck them. Even health reasons considered treason. Edit: sorry got long! trying think every way possible involved haha

So personal action whether cutting back cutting products buying farms verify care *yourself*. last point, sure grill farmer employee. mom tried buy farm guaranteed kill hens 18 months send slaughter (when egg laying declines) hens truly amazing care. true. instead sell hens farm would take guarantee comment happened sale...any farm going take nearly valueless animal going good.

Anyway, personal action get far accessible everyone. beyond recommend outreach others. dive fully vegan activism though things like Anonymous Voiceless want, everyone (I rounds great experiences route). General education awesome. college, hosting movie screenings, book clubs, getting involved clubs great. really believe lot change grassroots based, strength comes education awareness: something actively marketed against. education awareness comes next step another angle...

Politics. Factory farming barely starting touch political arena negative people want. politics, get touch local reps let know something care about. Let know stuff matters vote encourage others get involved. crappy part political change still comes individuals coming together: can't sit back say/do nothing expect things change. together influence movements. want see immediate direct impact, research local NGOs. directly related welfare, able intern sustainable farming bill (focused carbon regenerative agriculture) state created presented grass roots NGO...and passed year!!! exhilarating actually part legislative change see come together.

If big design, marketing, writing, etc, could see applying organizations like Mercy Animals rights groups focused industrial ag maybe create advertisements, slogans, get involved campaigns volunteer employee. remember load ads busses going around city years ago cruelty industrial ag. really cool. super die hard, make literally career. I've recently decided law school specifically get involved legal arena hopefully put brief experience policy effective use line animals. There's areas like research, business, full politics, nutrition science, environmental studies/science, etc could find ins school considering radical shift.

That might seem like little effort per idea, much, vague, keep mind awareness around issues relatively new push still young movement. Opportunities keep appearing grows think will. People deliberately misled corporations...such Happy Cows come California [feedlots actually statistically likely worse cows parts country]. Change coming, bit scrappy right might take creativity find angle involvement works you. 400k lot. gotta ask: panic 647,000 Americans die every single year hear related issued? 599,000 Americans die every year cancer?

Where's shutdown those? Where's federal mandates, calls shutdown economy those? didn’t lie would like Texas adding 20,000 cases healthcare system capable?

It's leaders understand science leaders. People would sympathetic theaters treat us captive audience, ""fuck you"" attitude covid. 

Crazy ticket prices, crammed theaters cleaned nearly enough, enforcing cell phone taking crying baby prohibitions, insane amounts trailers advertising main event, obscene concession prices. Overall movies miserable experience years nothing fix it, fuck 'em.

I feel bad workers jobs. idk anyone else ill legit get random places. like example went new haircut spot yesterday gave free N95 talking deer meat? thinking like pigeon possum. IMO great name deli. Fauci speaking general basic terms. getting experts differs Fauci saying? That's frankly curtious, try without spit. Ron Swanson great parody kind American. Herd immunity == Cull herd feeling person beliefs things fact abhorrent necessarily dictate agree either those. also possible feel ""separate"" (not exactly word I'm looking hope makes sense) one person feel another - way feel emotion one person another. care one necessarily* mean care other, even feel equal amount care both.

I wanna make sure- whenever see genocide occurring, try compassion person murdering people? 

Instead of, know, denouncing genocidal killer helping victims? think coddling evil people important? Let clear don’t blame friends going camping. Masks social distancing guidelines followed. It’s healthy sit inside day obsess topic. Well, would, wouldn’t they? mean, best track record comes this..

See tuskegee experiment more. Watching people defending billionaires millions starve really make believe capitalism cult. Yeah, worried that, sure Reps controlled legislature not. Could localized govs pass laws? Like per county city?  wear masks know idiots. Idiots idiotic things, like kill someone reason. heard pretty reliable source Donald Trump also 87 million twitter followers got covid. didnt even hear reported news. agree smoking bad don’t know would government it. already get spammed anti-smoking ads TV time. fact, praising little people smoke country. I’ve Spain Italy couldn’t go anywhere without seeing people smoking. story prime minister absolutely anything get away trial, three tied elections, he's using virus try stop protests him.

I mean probably true, still mean virus real. mutually exclusive ideas. Yeah there’s also immense reporting deaths attributing deaths caused manor problems covid covid present. Like cancer + covid = covid death. It’s overstated evidence popped place. coming doomsday prepper thought would horrible Jan. it’s proven significantly less lethal. It’s like .4% death rate even overblown stats. Well, except size matters insofar one teacher sick closes school complete fucking idiots Nothing wrong killing human nature Okay, nuanced, could provide even handful examples Wal-Mart came area food desert become one upon closing store?

Because ""Wal-Mart closes store creating food desert"" articles dime dozen given Wal-Mart one Michelle Obama's partners opening stores food deserts unsurprisingly one reasons food deserts exist lack demand areas. I'm surprised didnt take time read commenting. He's pro. RemindMe! 6 months know correct answer sub is: capitalism bad, universal healthcare works... know that. Still make barriers ultimately got less useless. Source! Morbid obesity result multitude factors including genetic childhood development. like saying poor result poor decision-making.  made sure stock PPE disinfectants early March. take much effort see bad things would get quickly. I'm vegetarian, fucking child. firm believer everyone cut back meat, expecting everyone go meatless going happen unless world literally ending, rate. 

Basic psychology. easier cut back eliminate, cutting back better lot people. would mean ischemic infarct. hemorrhagic one.

To fair, could due anticoags patients on.

She super sick young lady. saddening we're glossing lack PPE blaming asthma death. Blame victim system. lived greedy, good nothing system 6 months. I'm thankful I'm hospital cares employees profit now. hard sympathy complete fucking idiots probably feels like impotent rage. I'm sure resident genius could elaborate. is. Hahaha right *cries 0-4* really N95 mask KN95 one? Without proper wearing masks social distancing, lot people die unnecessary deaths many suffer life long problems, even they’re perfectly healthy today. Seems like terrible gamble make. may assumed people White House regularly tested/screened. since found even Trump wasn't. Still hard wrap heads around lack everything administration. acorn fall far...

""There long history Trump family denying serious illness. According Trump family friend, Trump’s father, Fred Trump Sr., insisted working even Alzheimer’s disease advanced 1990s. 'To retire expire!' Fred Sr. would say. friend said Fred Sr.’s disease worsened––he came stairs wearing three neckties––the family created system Fred could think still running Trump Organization. Every day Fred Sr. would go office Brooklyn would give blank papers sort sign. phone Fred’s desk set could dial secretary. 'Fred pretended work,' family friend matter discussion questions put forth, unless depictions numbers factually incorrect?

Because whoever finance/investor is, implicit bias make analysis data put forth covidtracking.com faulty. 

Can think reasons investor try paint rosy outlook future event? That's self centeredness got us mess yeah lack oxygen = brain hypoxia. What's crazy sides feel Chris Wallace biased side. asked twitter, agreed big deal. Actually, stop larger droplets, especially since get stuck plexiglas. well ventilated building, ventilation may help close range, plexiglas can. WTF wrong Florida? backwards thinking Meh, knew morons would catch sooner later. something process

doubt. ? Like seriously. virus never goes away literally gonna nothing whole life. easily go enjoy taking necessary precautions. amazon pays warehouse employees minimum wage, competitive wages departments. pretty generous considering skill-set required work amazon warehouse. people living impoverished countries would go great lengths earn much money honest days work. problem growing trend society make people like bezos, (who innovators boosting economy, creating jobs making life easier) bad guy. reality people need take personal responsibility livelihoods. Theyll give many chances wanna pay for. Meh, Trump hater, say, even without interruptions, Biden nothing say substance. making really good decision, thanks! real. proper cynic, believe coronavirus cynicism leads question capital-driven motivations behind rona denial response. guy cynic, he's moron. That’s still tip well get food go. servers still working asses .... unfortunate news earned untrustworthy reputation believe should. really bad flu season would IFR .5%. Usually closer .18% average. take look breakdowns IFR 40. information available. obviously age increases, covid infinitely higher flu. arguing 

as know, data year estimated information year 2. one type data yet. alot historicals Trump care dying Americans. behavior shows all. day 5 hospital him, must sick! point city allow autonomy independence places. Citizens try organize basically forced follow restrictions make food desert first place. Short opening farms (not feasible all) really much done. accurately recording deceased clinical care improve testing capabilities improve? weird see massive increase cases reported number deceased static regardless case load.  


It's like saying earn 2% interest put $100 put $10,000 either way $2 end year one bats eye.  


It's rather weird. daughter goes small private school south Houston. Like 3 kids class small. started labor day. go 2 days week. school already closed next 2 weeks teacher tested positive. wear masks day, eat lunch outside, constantly wash hands social distance times. Size matter GREAT optics. constant reminder ""LOOK, request shields administration take seriously puts others risk without remorse.""

Of course, MAGAs say unnecessary result liberal fear, lost cause anyway.  appreciate that. 

Sorry initial snarkiness, I'm hoping also wear mask protect others much yourself. 

Unfortunately even you/people age statistically likely serious health effects (although LT effects still open question even asymptomatic infections), anyone spreader.

I wish anyone, including friends family. Covid theater also less likely die respiratory illness due medical treatment now. Seems like reasonable thing do. We’ll never get crony capitalism.. it’s working well powerful people.. working class tricked thinking could one day worked hard enough. infuriating loll going better quality carbs white rice pasta helped late 20's. mid 40's cut 90% grains. sometimes I'll eat pizza snacks virtually every meal protein and/or veggies. grains. snacks buy nuts one kids taught make sports drinks Also know wasting disease jumped humans I'm big hurry see Healthcare expensive insurance companies. doctor, nurses, even hospital. One thing doesn’t other. asthma caused massive brain hemorrhage. Got it. Let's clarify: 65,000 Miami Dolphin fans left? sorry compassion morons run find way make work

And yet, one has, even populist lefties love much.

It's time tax land instead. is.. Sometimes it’s best never carelessly wish someone matter care might become turn you’ll need compassion you’ll need. usually spell names English way, pronounce Hebrew. writes J, think. Pronounce Y. Pence's people wanted away plexiglass, Harris campaign insisted them. True dat I'm sure think saying. first time read someone understanding importance prevalence outbreaks.

I played around bit math, comparing properties dynamics infections social networks macroscopic equations nuclear fission. similar. Floridian, Desantis spokesperson STFU. gave clearance knowing full well NFL going allow it. ""Heaven public beach that's got yourself."" -Chris Christie En Limburg! someone who's retirement depends 401K I'll cheer stock market Lmao ah yeah, correct. ""transparent"" ass. cant. point. Sweden litterally highest amoumt single households world fuck Tegnell keep getting away crap. Primarily, US involved lot international political issues prevent Soviet Union, Russia, Russia China, undue influence.

The current administration effectively letting Russia China influence. US think going negative effects global political stability, fine. thinks will, making mistake. Israel US' greatest ally. Tho, know US isnt best example this.

Yes, even warnings masks social distancing many normal asshole self caring. Except, comparing flu deaths year, COVID deaths barely 6 months. closer 6.66.

Except, fact COVID similar seasonal pattern (which, Corona, probably will) summer deaths likely 1/3 we'll see winter half year. (~20k deaths) comparing months, evenly, 9.99.

Jesus people following political parties braindead. thanks. get point, frustrates end really *is* reason restrictions need stay level been. could returned mostly normal now...if competent leadership.

1. Yes, think restrictions help. various modeling studies show such. said, correct initially lockdowns intended buy us time: time prepare health infrastructure deal eventual casualties, also learn much could new disease order fight effectively. Sadly, learned much, we've learned ignored.
2. Restrictions daily life hard. Certainly, think balance would tip far favor reducing restrictions **if** could ensure 70-80% mask compliance robust contact tracing (with adequate testing capacity back up). Look Asia! They've done exactly slowly returning mostly normal. current situation US *completely* avoidable, fact things would need justify reducing restrictions done, *will* done...well, case think balance tips much favor keeping restrictions place. It’s OK skeptical, it’s OK make wild claims vaccine studies haven’t looked all, even quick Google search. no, really find must've taken forgot archive difficult anyone, downplay least, idea need advanced degree simply true. *is* easiest streamlined way get permanent residency, unless marrying citizen incredibly wealthy, like said.

I'm saying easy. all. glamorous 99% time. *impossible.* engineer 

Definitely top risk factor. Engineers notoriously stubborn. Yeah figured dude exaggerating. seems love spreading weird misinfo make pandemic sound worse. they're saying can't expect much 6 days. think anyone arguing succeed. think Zuck, Elon, ESPECIALLY Bezos (not) money. Nobody upset Bill Gates got richer he's spearheading truly incredible cause fraction wealth. ever seen video Bezos' wealth visualized? Pig shit brains different locking down. trying harder. Nothing falls clear sky. It’s ok least wasn’t super bowl anything haha right Google gain-of-function research virology. Look BSL (Bio safety level) 4 lab well. see Wuhan institute virology one two BSL 4 labs world studying coronavirus. BSL4 lab China violations last 2 years.

I'm nutjob thinks 5G causes plandemic, etc... There's probable conspiracy here... entire world got hit, United States. Yeah, knew know bad was. Especially telling us spread.... couple months lied world made huge difference. Well maybe people would stop pieces shit. chance set example. Everyone watching schizophrenia? People really need lot things. However make life worth living nah, thats good old steak me. What's evidence KN95s KF94s required form, capable forming, tight air seals? someone dumb got religious I've wondered thing.  Amazing actually said that. tightly cling beliefs still physically experiencing them? classifications may seem arbitrary first glance, someone journeyed Class 3 overweight last six years, difference feel enormous, associated signs impending metabolic syndrome disappeared.

(I got big scare heaviest blood pressure abnormally high. later attributed simply big salty lunch doctor's visit, definitely wake call. Blood pressure nice 118/70 last checkup.) Let’s stay topic wording, eh?

I respect opinion nit picking, disagree. 

To me, way author words shows agenda. month ago. I'm 36, never voted. simply cannot **handle** another four years this. Waiting mail ballot now. Obviously always nutcases everywhere *every* idea. Luckily though country (as far know) made u.s. decision makers 

To fair, bad idea strategy better bleach thing. wonder personally, worn mask awhile. Got new one couple days ago (disposable blue one). picture Trump’s debate prep. eating plant sometimes?

Tried, steak still WAY better Huh. That’s interesting/shocking considering lot Union states confederate states right isolating. Yeah, good thing healthcare covered basic need citizens, general security livelihood good easily accessible members said society. What’s figure president gets infected goes super spreader misinformation spree? \--every sane person liked that-- means dedicated life subject, actually make smart around person. look subreddits like /r/idiotsincars, always find examples rich people complete morons.  Unfortunately wasn’t sarcastic. thought noble dissident inquisitor asking legitimate question. But, alas gave ways hivemind.  earth round. Circles round.

The earth oblate spheroid.  So... kind hinting coronavirus act war China since article comparing war time casualties? point... pull respirator stop treatment faking illness. hand family one swanky black body bags sleep in. Someone level kill others too. votes work Mitch McConnell. needs REMOVED Senate. Anything know, also believe, definitions terms.  


Also, careful kind reasoning able convince anybody. flat earther would say exact thing.  


There's issue that, strictly speaking, can't 100% certain really anything except exist capacity, thoughts.  


But physical universe even guaranteed exist, perceive senses. ultimate twist foreseeable tragedy needs experimental drugs trump got reaches trump them, trump rejects it. choose mask socially distance cold 99.9% survival rate age groups ""more likely kill anything else""? would quickly change governments made meat inaccessible. Great depression white tail deer almost driven extinction couple years.  Simple, US financial political incentive make Pfizer vaccine pass non-US vaccine one. trial need paused first, ask rest countries resumed keep delayed you’re saying 400k Americans surely die. there, came back already. *shudder* tell you. Texas handled covid could anywhere. saying lot kids absent last week though maybe one kids. teacher cold like symptoms fever got tested anyways came positive elective surgery revenue? Fine, we're ordering masks Wish. CainCloud powered Oracle.   Filtration pretty much three, yes. fitment N95 outperforms two, straps go completely around head, versus ear loops.

The distance people's ears mouths, well height size ears, varies quite bit, lot times, rather difficult achieve perfect, proper, continuous seal around edges KN95 KF94.

And, might expect, inhaling even one breath contaminated environment without perfect seal allows contaminants bypass filtration end lungs.

(breathability also slightly easier N95. Slightly.) Well really love guy, day saw Cuomo saw Trump gasping breath Fauci said ""We saw him, looks like he's well"" went talk Regeneron probably made President better enough return White House.

I like guy well enough, carries water administration far ought to, far I'd like. work retail thankful plexiglass. I'd say 10% customers disobey mask rule 25% wear masks wrong, use vented masks, remove mask ask questions, etc.

The barrier first line defense infected droplets exiting morons' bodies. Saves wear goggles, least. missing point. One's ideas heavily influenced environment one born into. Good idea or... could keep maximize profits. hospital must eat Buffett. turtle highly offended lumped species! wonder many classified covid ? realize animal farming requires plant farming exist, right? Much more, fact; every pound meat produced requires 10x amount plants. Plants could've eaten first place.

Worldwide, [only 55% crop production actually goes towards feeding share far smaller live developed world. United States, 27% crop calories consumed directly, whereas 67% used animal feed.

Of course agri-business general problems, many directly linked excessive amounts meat produce/consume. LOL sure. idea would meat prices? eager pay food, guest. force others tho. Fertilizer would used regardless practices animal agriculture. Improved farming methods reduce fertilizer runoff successful, things simple putting heavy rains using cover crops. called Tucker Carlson dick face. TV. Jon Stewart? There's pandemic? Oh time ban meat. Time cut away fossil fuels. Time open borders. People wonder large segment population get board covid solution, ""solutions"" peppered leftist economic moral ideals related Coronavirus. Good know. one gets headband style KN95 would solve gap? thinly veiled journalists use others justify position using others example scientific fact. happens sides. Listen majority scientists, fringe either side. *Or sign living food desert and/or poor self care education.*

Sure... dude top 0.1% society. obesity purely fault. New Zealand closed latest cluster community case full cycle 14 days covid free again. Wouldn’t surprise all, doesn’t care anyone doesn’t benefit it’s worth would work putting mask he'd damage only.Sadly he'll damage others :/ one ever went broke underestimating intelligence American public title list stated focus. states ""US Political Figures Covid-19 Megathread"". becomes less factuality ego: point they've invested much believing covid political hoax finally admit wrong would *self-destroying* psyche can't handle. several unions. still face uphill battle. lot healthcare workers can’t quit due loans well need employment furlough hiring freezes due covid. ""Hey! Totaly fine get sick and/or die now! capacity you. fuck healthcare workers anyway, amirite? Try infect many people can! Let's fill hospitals up! show liberals. Also, heard, burn units ton capacity, feel free set fire hug bunch people burning!!!"" Good owner hope receptionist better. I'm lucky work outside plenty space social distancing. Pretty sure Israel opposite right wing govt calling lock left side opposing that.

As much ppl say virus political definitely else also Lol. touch mask 50 times meal public. 


You people listen shit need wake up. Like now. Still, lets wish speedy recovery. one deserves die COVID disease. funny seeing replies him, since blocked he's clearly case ""the empty rattles most"". Looks like he's staying true character rest lol AstraZeneca vaccine trial still paused US? infodemic, perpetuated information laundering conspiracy theorists followers engage in. Yeah nothing surprises anymore can’t literally believe anything comes White House, Trump could say I’m hungry I’d like don’t know really believe that, it’s sad Oh like ones said cloth masks work, ended wrong? U probably believed Santa til 10. One question. bandana keep safe back it’s known potentially make worse? make far? article says FDA given information requested (probably recently). They're probably still going it. Well, really emergency savings... never know happen! want say /s seriously fuck big businesses told individual employees shit years end. honestly responsible profits, people greedy. Hopefully fat fucks next stop funeral home social life though, that's misconception comparison. mass unemployment, massive recession, end small business America. balance. said, Americans socially responsible socially protected American are. trademarked, i'm sure he'd call Ultimate Warrior Unless underlying issue like health age, wrecking economy going painful corona. judge made mandatory post screen show then. 
*NOTHING HEAR REALITY*. I’m fairly sure it’s used spread nursing homes lot deaths result. measures taken stop kind spread. days larger percentage get infected young healthy therefore survive. officially looking like something's up. looking especially suspicious recent UK driven push vaccinate healthy young adults.

This speculation. Many countries bought dosages Oxford vaccine plan vaccinate age groups, thinking might pre-mature. interesting FDA still holding though. 

The optimist says extra cautious. pessimist thinks political force push Pfizer Moderna hit finish line first (in USA). 

The idea Europe going push vaccine potentially unsafe speculation (I hope). really crazy reddit went “Taiwan Tibet uyghurs” “China wrong” matter months fair, Trump standing moving around own.  That's ""doing well"" compared vent hospital bed. differences sports played probably ought factor covid protocols Still far worse North Korea's zero cases. sub simply doesn’t scientific literacy posting articles drug development. correct. Immunity seems last. probably right it’s sad think otherwise, hope people least sort conscience it’s reality early 2020, changed stance matter. Yep 2 industries effected. Thousands small businesses closed country hey doesnt effect cares, right?

I wish surprised selfishness stupidity sadly im not. Aslong covid restrictions save one life fuck everyone everything else. happens one side plays dirty politics like nominating supreme court justice 3 years experience judge voting already begun.

Unfortunately reap so. still ways GOP, pathetic realize it. ""Made China"" different ""made Chinese company."" Chinese companies held accountable crap products kill people countries. 3M makes crap product kills someone, they're held accountable they're American company. Chinese company says ""too bad sad"" that's end it.

The problem geographical location products made, race people making them. problem lack accountability owners Chinese companies held accountable actions. I'm type person try help people. try educate people, especially areas expertise. facebook possible people receptive. FB almost exclusively dumbest people arguing discussing non-sense false information. people educated informed refuse interject factual information always outnumbered loud voices inability learn new things.

I've since given trying help others FB. see incorrect information time, watch people eat shit up, nothing let so. Wait we’re supposed wearing mask we’ve since April? mostly agree you, except point education destroyed reversed. kind cultural myth education used better, wasn't. Less 100 years ago, much American public education system children community, regardless age background, single room class teacher basically teaching whatever wanted. pretty fucked education system, like ever better now. 


Most people throughout human history believed opinions = facts, thats nothing new. assumed everybody could get online educate sift information looking objective truth, we'd better species. wrong, seems like internet accelerated natural tendencies humanity cling whatever version reality comfortable fits worldview. masticators. Lol ok. say people shouldn’t complain billionaires trillionaires amassing wealth global pandemic, discipline invest market well. point citations that’s sound argument. call ignorant. Cool cool cool makes bunch sense. Enjoy working fast food simultaneously defending Jeff Bezos I’m sure one day trillionaire. Yeah France UK whole bunch countries *same* US.. what's point? BIG MISTAKE!! manufacturing pretty complex long. They’ll certainly make difference, month two  don’t, that’s there’s expectancy know exactly long, definitely 3 months. Every indication vaccines give long lasting immunity. Call pessimist, get feeling another event like Covid-19 Covid-19 even over. Surprised didn’t burst laughter said that. Lmao

You aggressive upset started ""cursing"". really child. literally disclosed limited energy make life easier manner, that's enough you. Nothing is, I'm going elaborate someone trying listen.

Y'know, might start eating steak again. even like it, honor. Childish tactics beget more. :) Delicious cow slaughter, mmm. treat believe it?.  Leave em die. believe vaccinations, cannot get help hospital.  believe coronavirus get treated. Simple that.  would weed morons. Well, meat's never going away. farm factories get banned happen change land used. 


For example, right now, like 80 miles country middle live, buy 5 acres land next nothing, say $8000 5 acre lot. access running water electrical grid, hella remote. road exists it, dirt windy miles long. 


So happen people buy land new businesses come work like cattle sharing. 


So say create new business bring cows graze land bread etc, let use 5 acre lot. I'd maybe 10 cows little w/e. I'd take 10 cows somewhere else on. We'd supply feed, solar power stations, digging wells water. land would become part network.  


We might 100,000 cows spread accross 100's small plots land region owned different people want make money land access meat. 


Basically, would like franchising raising animals. People could rent cows milk, get butcher. might 8 people buy cow split meat. end grocery stores, get meat delivery. seems way easier said done. alternative factory farming raise food prices emissions? said ""nah like power"" next. But, but, pwesident said it’s big deal! rats going lick themselves. We've extremely lucky virus size sooner. important always pandemic ready. unlikely another pandemic likes COVID hit next 10 years. hopefully Fauci responsible sake. federal help sight, Newsom supposed do? Even Cuomo recognizes small businesses can't stay closed forever. Awesome thanks. I'll post convo DM's. Aug 15 might alittle dated. apologies editing.

 *Me making pleasantries asking general info know

All good man. still way early tell long term affects CV systemic virus receptor hijacks get cell, ACE2 expressed everywhere.. 
The issue see lung damage critical cells types involved maintains structures facilitate gas exchange (alveoli). theres lung injury, develop essentially calluses lung condition called fibrosis. fibrotic activity deadly simply can't get enough oxygen blood stream distributed rest body. 
As blood, seems involvement blood vessel cells/tissues, platelets (dudes clot) damaged clotting. bad thing. Clotting kill nearly instantly major problem.

*Me asking prevention

yes masks, distancing hygiene go LONG way limit spread. n95 best worn whenever indoors strangers like grocery store, Costco smaller spaces like restaurant pick food. Masks needed simply walking around outside trails, neighborhood, exercising things like that. outside, mask, inside somewhere wear mask limit time inside place strangers much possible. Pretty easy incredibly minor inconvenience. poet, Harry.

I'd totally give award spotting replying manner, due reasons given I' also poor. fixed! thanks “Who’s playing COVID Bowl year?” 4 years? Fuck guy, give Covid make sure doesn’t medical care. responses I’m getting sounds lot like hospitals healthcare providers don’t want pay prices it, really depressing ☹️ found would allowed wear them? I’m sorry that’s happening hope stay well! Yet love accusing others ""virtue signaling"" ranted liburls saw Obama ""the messiah"" implying cult personality. Yet oddly never seen Obama flag, Obama boat flotilla, Obama Hummer Parade etc. think that's expectation anymore it? Things slowed hospitals normalish? already told reason need eggs.

No, didn’t. There’s supposedly reason think need eggs chronic illness didn’t disclose - it’s probably innacurate **contributing end world** pushing people away blind hatred.

OMG!! 😂 ok, we’re done here.

P.s. one started cursing. merely spilling facts vegetarian/pescatarian/flexitarian whatever people. Same.. asked someone 

“Why think surgeons wear masks?”

They replied:

“THEY REQUIRED DUMBASS!”

I speechless.. without speech. one notable mutation impact vaccine effectiveness. bootlicking opposite end spectrum. BILLIONS dollars loans taken snatch wealth smaller fish. access $million+ pandemic fucking gold mine.  grocery shop 2-3 hours. 15-20 minutes tops. Infections caused proximity **duration** contact. reasonable age front PC would still get educated, problem younger ones school mostly parking parents working economic slavery. point economic advantage, would still pay teachers, contagion rate would definitely decline.

As per absurd idea abolish school altogether, personally agree. China 0 cases Covid aren’t caught travelers. 

Who cares expensive. sure saw previous reply deleted (after realizing replying wrong person)

But try best reasonable :) One man’s trash another man’s pen knife stabbing Miami-Dade Hospital statistics: (Per COVID situation report #205

Total Beds: 6,135 / COVID patients non-ICU beds: 248 (4%)

Total ICU Beds: 1,449 / COVID patients ICU beds: 98 (6.7%)

Ventilators: 1,527 / COVID patients ventilators: (4%)

&amp;#x200B;

If \~5% hospital's COVID resources utilized, ask safe fully open? exactly bellweather would make sub comfortable? US adding 243 000. Holy shit! Found Russian troll June nothing outbreak September. government deliberately railroaded second wave prevention order get reelected last week. dissolved emergency team, called September. PM undermines director health changing directives every days. People got brainwashed press owned populist PM Covid nothing cold seasonal flu. Various celebrities support PM appeared across Czech media saying got Covid fine two days big deal... 

Really, Charles Bridge party nothing second wave, biggest problem appeared rural areas, even cannot test cases. government 3 months prepare wasted. Even rate testing went last 10 days. \*so far still would better spend roughly $50M per team put everyone bubble. decision act “normal” appease orange guy. I’m calling liar, I’m saying default can’t accept claim. It’s nice social media work way. far see it, also takes decent amount effort users part find sort consistent content. I’m glad you’ve got working you, apologize previous salt beginning exchange. take job can't take criticism. Simple solution. much worse things people liking you. People homeless coronavirus, they're homeless response it. doubt sub realize everything trade off, solutions cause problems, they're really solutions they? likely handled well

How handle virus without mass testing? Yet twittered New FDA Rules make difficult speed vaccines approval Election Day. another political hit job! sound like: ""there good people sides, even neo Nazis' ranks"" never bought it...the entire “you don’t really need mask” thing made absolutely sense start. Yeah right. Fkc kids. Screw them. Getting drunk important! means safe want begrudgingly admit that.  scenarios absurd really probable. import chi india country  What's meaningless asking FL Sweden? cause can't answer make 
meaningless.

Virus gonna virus. We've never solved viral respiratory pandemic vaccine. HIT real thing thats solution unless want destroy every facet economies Vaccinate 1000 10 dont drop dead safer disease. people compare flu makes think fucking asleep wheel flu. us know many died flu every year.

How much spent public health vs much spent wars? Divide figures number deaths get idea stupid humans are. think compare 2 anymore send robots. wonder add drone/robot deaths tally, close would lol Excess deaths. Lol, guy thinks Trump mastermind pandemic response strategy.  get pool, get friend pool Preach United States, CDC stated 12,000-61,000 deaths ANNUALLY since 2010. US already 211,000 deaths still almost 50,000 cases day. Misinformation “leader”? I’ll say! logic math could follow basic human rights world would much better place.

Now define ""better"", logic math would dictate lot things likely like happen. ZERO fucks given... Anyone normal won’t like it. shut losers will! silent gen, boomers to. Even gen x. probably also get compliant death toll rises. smokes, clearly demonstrated priorities, here's hint: smoking takes precedence baby. baby priorities change all... gonna say kids taken away, say maybe kid.

It's kids, think anyone making decisions take responsibilities know can't handle. people selfish children, world would better place people could admit themselves. everyone needs kid. Hey! CDC released new stats showing even less fatal stats posting, too. political bias showing. Look first-world countries handled/are handling tell we're good job. Go ahead. There's literally post saying FHM (ie Tegnell) fucked start. criticism lot people here. parts he/they done really well - e.g. able keep schools open.

Just he's fucked stuff mean detractors criticism. SNL hasn’t relevant 20 years, least. I'm living life normal now. complied months months. Wasted away locked inside house. Now, done. I'm driving rules. said start need focus isolation efforts elderly people immunocompromised. entire site called selfish murderer that. Now, seems though people starting wake up. take anymore. Look actual mortality stats virus. extremely negligible. Especially people 70 immunocompromised. We're talking like 0.0005%. rate nukes reclassified biological weapons mass destruction people listen him, scary. know 2 people mid 90s great, recently quit driving. close schools people accept bars restaurants closed. heart disease deaths could've prevented strong government action tbf, lot cancer deaths too. I'm pro government action public health reasons across board tho tbh. Cigarettes banned masks made mandatory everyone hour physical activity day arent disabled Yep. costs high. That’s don’t think voting party candidate problem all. many countries vote party party supplies list individuals (eg germany). problem single member districts make voting pointless minority populations become apathetic uninvested government. think hard say even revokes status Americans. Let's say Trump loses November tries steal election via supreme court. Let's say supreme court rules favor. 

I think many us would go war that. Now, side traitors? longer Americans? side morally wrong? Legally wrong? decides that? two sides fighting believe (even twisted, stupid, fucked way, good country? Yeah, I’m traveling business it’s nothing see families small children traveling. I’m like going? think people traveling domestically whatever reason. sure talking cars. talk totally topic like? agree many cars bad lot reasons limited banning would great people cities. People want keep car convenience expense everyone else city selfish pricks. 

Maybe bit harsh - still can’t leave home unless necessary trip emergency? allow meet anyone anywhere reason prisoner home (except leave get groceries). worth mentioning rather hard get tested. several symptoms preparing hospital procedure get state test. pay commercial test count official statistics. 

So much worse 3000 cases... Go post negative reviews. kind name trey songz.  Many countries done lockdown many people working home, wearing masks social distancing. economy contracted many countries 10%.

Despite still 1 million reported covid-19 deaths.

If everyone ignored covid-19, 50 100 million would probably died covid-19 directly another 100-200 million chaos side effects.

Tuberculosis also serious disease, untreated maybe even deadly covid-19. 

But unlike covid-19 treatment mostly works.

On top tuberculosis contagious person symptoms covid-19 often spread people know sick. Yeah, said entire time got called selfish murderer. hive mind strong reddit. believe anything they're told to. No, Fort Sumter Union more, *South Carolina* seceded.  
The government confederate government asked union troops vacate premises repeatedly, instead reinforced position attack began bringing supply ship reinforce would enabled blockade port.  
  
The whole era mess, idea solely fault south typical victor's revisionist history made easier obvious terrible nature slavery racism, ignores reality actual situation. Dense report. Copernicus declared earth round orbited sun, majority scientists time also disagreed. make wrong.

Its clickbait. 6,000 qualified individuals calling mental health aspect lockdowns serious issue needs addressed. see restricting movement, economic uncertainty isolation can't damaging mental health. Almost like others making lots money it. pulls negotiations stimulus bill. Schools need stay open economy that's calculated risk try soften harsher regulations essential areas. That's guess atleast, dont like one bit.  Yeah, like every winter. Nah, conservative figure one die whole thing hoax. real kicker noone seems understand. without single shot fired. actually quite extraordinary considering American obsession firearms. probably won’t ... buckle up. Ugh  I'm American confused you. Simply put, president manipulated political issue. found out, knew bad really beginning year. believe saw major threat stock market, turned be, want risk looking weak election year. 

His supporters ate age social media soaked crackpot theories stories put front them. I've seen discussions reddit republicans refuse show ""weakness"" see wearing masks afraid deadly virus affront strength. 

It's absolutely ridiculous live this. Feeling helpless hoping people care much careful try be. lot friends make feel disappointed angry watching behavior. 

Reading article hits particularly hard wife second kid April peak state live in. frightening disappointing able things done past like older sister able do.

I want over. LMAO yeah tried telling idiots reddit apparently I'm murderer cares myself. Look many tickets sold.

I'm sitting every day handling flood cancellations. 

If airport full, cut 50% price. fill people care. run those. Eliminating courts fascism. need 200,000 get WW II achievement Guess wars fake eh?  
/s Yes numbers China show us transparent. Don’t naive Good lord that's insane mental gymnastics even Tucker. almost beautiful absurd still seeming make sense. work really well. limit audience.

I hope B. supporters asking remote debates help B. teleprompter. warfare 'socialized' health care not... actual number probably higher, confirmed deaths. know actual number estimated pandemic ends People learn hard way. ""Just 2 years guys, promise"" No. me. Theres theory trump would shown patient zero, can't we? quite good reviews Yelp. Everybody says wear masks get door. Can't speak countries, people US would burn motherfucker allowing prices meat potentially increase all. Prices meat artificially cheap US already hear people complain prices. And, know, real meal there's meat!

If people can't even put piece cloth face, think they're gonna give food? LOL. Never. Far selfish stupid people here. thought New Zealand finished...?!  someone grew shitty environment least admit 'crab bucket' mentality real. yes every person deserves carve way, number people like far exceeded simply succumb next generation shit people. Top google answers

Google answer - 34,157

Cdc - 24,000 62,000

Health magazine - quotes CDC numbers

WebMD - 8,200 20,000

People little google. Trouble is, people wont. Obviously quick rundown, enough poor info confuse people. tough time misinformation, lot people(myself included) exhausted dig mess. Didnt imperial college model predict deaths would millions? Trump administration tone deaf anything everything secure another 4 years office sacrifice health well-being even folks White House others. even take advice aformer partisan CDC director, indicates, political agenda also know bounds win re-election. disgusting. Ok think ppl perceive COVID flu understand wrote? *Sucker losers.*

-Captain Cheese Puff, probably ‘scientists’ totally lacking humanity. advocate “survival fittest” virtual imprisonment vulnerable older people. also ignore Long COVID, risk long term effects infection seems harmless now. Neither countries mask advice spring either

But one shutdown didn't. Mask mandates came various times across many countries reopened. worship money hate libs. simple. state live in? First thing would school produce money likely spread viruz.   Trump: hold mask, I’ll make civil war search count look small again! It’s first thing everyone closes gets bad. Even Texas ""real numbers"" 250k? Cause there's pandemic going on? Biden in-person rallies March party criticizing Trump shutting air travel January. 7 10 states worst COVID deaths per million predominantly blue. Joe Biden barely enough marbles brain know half time much less mastermind behind pandemic response strategy Good thing added disclaimer end Reddit gonna burn post 🔥🔥🔥 single day?! question was. COVID wasn’t here, would cause 200k excess deaths year? make trump war time president? best bet is: preventing infection perfectly, reducing casual aerosol transmission much, especially singing shouting, effect mucus saliva transmission, preventing severe illness almost perfectly. Still work isn’t. It’s so. fucking. overused. enact another strict lockdown. least forbid fun.  I'm US want live so... say one wants live there, everyone does. Saying everyone wrong. ‘Some people die!’ 
‘Then you?’ 
‘Oh well *me*!’ 
Then buddy? gets die? wanted accuracy corrected person above.

You right correct further. :) US response Covid-19 atrocious, comparison absurd. thread coronavirus Antifa. Try stay topic quit lame attempt straw man argument. He's nearly entirely sidelined though, compared months ago. Totally this. 

My family Chinese. I’m Europe surrounded people hanging bars masks chins exposed noses, relatives back China don’t even live hot zone restrictions voluntarily staying home. voices families dead? aren’t marching Washington? completely perplexed silence. covering whatever say?  Russia made available people high risk, phase 3 trials. Putin's daughter involved development volunteered early tests. 

China offers Chinese business people travel outside China. Im sure especially trumps videos yesterday. Might see spike weeks. Better failing day one remaining failed, though, eh. logic (and use word loosely) amazing.

You cultists hilarious. can't imagine like live world common sense longer applies all. get might simply troll pulling leg, course.

Anyway, I'm going enjoy nice virus free unrestricted lifestyle. No, see video/photos photographer balcony behind walked past people standing doorway entered WH. many chairs would every American died Covid? 1000 times that. Adjustments population important.

We count chairs lives ruined lockdowns, suicides caused lockdowns, people put risk death poverty lockdowns. Something tells would dwarf chair picture. worst part is, chairs would represent young people would lose far years life elderly. Running time what? mention companies willingly turn blind eye despite ""masks required"" window dressing them, short term profit important long term wellbeing employees customers alike.  take precautions get others take precautions invaded half middle east it. Time destroy chinese communist party, hang fuckers like hanged Saddam Fine. Maybe someone else explain it, then. That's fun fact I'd like put Donald Trump's tombstone day. According CDC, sars-cov2 infections, 10k deaths covid19 deaths. So, punishment Chinese party ? Nuke Beijing [I’m guessing isn’t true media always anyone know?  still geniuses ponder vote.. Human stupidity truly limits cares. running time. speed lockdown question days maybe. Gotta enjoy show can. haven’t able work 6+ months

Buy pull bar, survive push ups, squats, pull ups. excuses! think time like good. came roughly one. think antibody therapy also promising. interested see data it. far antibodies go would good see make brewery massive amounts lol.  virus that's killing people scenario, antifa. bullets. government do? would suggest loved ones Tulsa do? That’s gas tank It’s easy creating wars countries isn’t it? makes 41 new cases per 100k people Yes. feel this. I’m LA isolating girlfriend since beginning. crack sitting apartment longer went Grand Canyon weekend. Felt good soul see amazing nature man amount people without masks park around Arizona upsetting. Williams like pandemic, many shop owners didnt wear masks coffee baristas. Flagstaff together least. would say park itself.....easily 65% everyone wearing masks. Hope little getaway didn’t fuck us. take actions prevent risks. laws, guidelines, restrictions, social decency. follow those. 

Each chair picture represents 10 Americans dead COVID-19. Wake Yes...but saying America, disingenuous.  ""Military advisers"" lol. really believe obvious lie? sent troops earliest opportunity tried retroactively change history whole war less embarrassment. depends would kill them. cause virus latest data showing fatality rate .1-.4% even less age 65 good health (.001%) would say forcing businesses shut down, bankrupting making millions unemployed forcing perfectly healthy people wear masks correct solution. Good try though. agree. already tired masks important wear one.
 need improved n-95 mask that's reusable. saw one internet $65 code health care workers. 
 bad past pandemics still horrible. Getting food delivered getting take bad. continue thing regarded responsible person post social media ""wear masks"" ""be responsible"", much death. thiink significant. think take pandemic seriously. Practicing social distancing vital essential services open. really hate people organize crowd rvents like tru,p rallies blm events... Turtle covid, confirmed. it’s gas rig, aren’t following controls well latest long line cutting corners cheap. Bad enough people fly Europe work close proximity together. stop, give goal! also ... try get work muscle pains headache go away, we'll see well fare long term. post community? r/covidcure I'm trying create community cure, treatment vaccine covid  LAKERS! Apparently Americans really taught Veitnam Korea. I've explain several times people live one involved countries happened. Weird go Veitnam everyone knows happened lot people come talk Caucasian. I'm sure similar Korea too.

For reason though America seems find 2 wars meddled countries agency reason serve military industrial complex fucked royally something gloss over. exactly impemented cannot capitalist country? far read simple things like immediately close travel China, immediately close school, citizens masks quarantine sick. difference seems acted decisively, leadersof goverment calling hoax politicizing mask wearing. punishments follow rules. things non-communist goverment capable of. states lacking statewide ban banned public places. Graphic warnings packs, minimal age buying, prohibitions ads, huge anti-smoking campaings, etc. Smoking rates declining steadily years that.

So wtf talking about... cases low

the testing horrendous important \*live\* \*live long\*. I'd rather live life I'm active get meet people, maybe girlfriend etc, sit indoors entire life live ""long"" life. would take 330k serious side effects heartbeat stops pandemic cold tracks. 

That brings another number table 0.1% serious side effects 99.5% people gain immunity efficient stopping pandemic. brings 50% chance immunity stop pandemic. Suddenly need arbitrage May-be still OK people 70 general population. 

covid bad windows : bad enough rush vaccine treatment, serious wait 10 years perfect vaccine. Trump reaper. However, like 90% casualties came 1965-1971. /r/ChurchOfCOVID like that? worlds richest countries hit hardest? would vaccinate Somalia UK?  sure person's friend? There's also way Americans 1942. Adjust populations. There's far greater chance will. would terrified know many daily actions take risk others, far greater Covid.

It's time people stop getting dictate people time lives, them. Nobody saying spread, insignificant compared reckless recreational activities, way necessary recreational stuff too. “They” vague. 

Can specify “they” overlap “they” lied masks “they” studies BLM protests? trick measure long M\*A\*S\*H went divide 3. people tell it’s 99.9% survival rate. literally didn’t answer question equine polyclonal antibodies, obtained injection recombinant SARS-CoV-2 protein horses, have hyperimmune effect, 100 times powerful recovered plasma.

It sounds like trials curre flu ongoing. Looking forward seeing results. 

The smoothest smooth brains.  Looking numbers,yes slowing down.

The ground reality however completely opposite/didfferent story. credible threat 400 people would killed Tulsa, steps government take prevent deaths? masked, outdoor events safe right? go beach zoo? reaction read that. got thinking posts I’ve seen Facebook like moms 3 kids who’ve lost jobs options getting social support swept away they’re going minds. Ive seen comments people like saying “what live for?” 

Also really big problem alcoholism great state, bars closing means folks going isolated drinking home. they’ve going bars every day long time, it’s probably don’t think it’s good drinking home. 

There’s probably truth he’s saying.  non American, local governments much? shutting down. actually agree shut more, especially states higher death tolls. point gonna realize viruses spread gathering like may kill someone didnt attend Facts. feel like I'm bizzaro world reading high upvoted comments. ""experts"" must live reality lol 211,000 Americans, 1.05 million people globally, celebrated New Years eve us, made plans they'd year, knowing months they'd dead. FakeNews? basically 0 risk dying Covid anyone one book signings probably care either. see problem. point guys gonna realize humans want act like humans again. One percent high estimate though. likely less 1%, even hospitals capacity. Well middle east estimated 1,000,000-2,000,000 excess deaths since 2001 conflicts (which fair US military action). do, people stupid somehow wearing mask became symbol government impinging freedumbs. make everyone government take cognition test they’ve covid? one person don’t like? Thankfully ADA protect people discrimination. is, worry it. Ever heard concussion? Nothing make people happy reason exist anymore. whole sub comes like bunch Country Club Whites 80s movie, quarantining pools ranting others embrace making living judging people enjoy cornfield. (factual) liberal news. Democrats don’t care people! /s Nice hear! narrative contradiction collectivism individualism false. individual choices modern society afforded society. ultimately everyone's self interest advance interest collective. There's contradiction collectivism individualism. Individuality simply contributing society individualistic ways.

What actually makes difference here, however, different two moral system. Western entitlement based moral system, every moral discussion comes rights, versus responsibility based moral system, moral discussion ends right thing do. Agreed.  It’s rather small part article interesting focus part. back trying give cover. It’s highly respected magazine known highly factual 
 like trying cover pathetic job Tegnell co done. whole time. Schools close... high school order lower public transport usage. Average age Corona deaths: 80+. Average age war deaths (Vietnam): 23.

Such comparisons nonsens. Repeating ad nasum change fact. Well, might wanna look recent corona stats... like experts predicted. Same, start September. whole lot people wore masks GC minimal interaction Flagstaff seemed bid well. went Zion regards mask wearing. Establishments least seemed follow mask guidelines places went though. consolation, tested negative trip(got tested week after). demographics shifting rapidly away Republicans. They've permanently lost minorities, losing white people well. Millennials Zoomers also seem politically involved older cohorts. spells trouble GOP unless consider major realignment. That’s opinion piece, trying give cover. 

Naucler deleted Twitter account cannot link amateurish extrapolation demanding Tegnell resign (and admitting shared articles Russia Today, like troll read preprint predicting 100k deaths (there I’m sure safe effective vaccine readily available citizens little cost, problems production, distribution distrust. like PPE been.

TL;dr Medicine evolved. Humans haven’t. United Kingdom Great **Britain** Ireland remained officially neutral throughout American **Civil War** (1861–1865). ... British elite tended support Confederacy, ordinary people tended support United States, Union ""the North"". little disingenuous - could say lot diseases. would like know estimate many deaths would reasonably preventable think would better measure. Go look US total population world war 1, course people die 2039, there's way people. Redditors retarded. Source? ""likely voter"" polls I've seen shows Bidens lead shrink 2-4% compared ""registered voter"" polling. both. downplay coronavirus, important difference;

Most war casualties young men whole life ahead them.

Most coronavirus casualties old men already bad condition.

Yes, coronavirus disaster treated disaster. No, can't compare 1:1 war. I’m sure tbh. didn’t good experience him. body guards friends let get physical women excuse “that’s is.” It’s hard try tell people celebs automatically assume women lying gain something know every opportunity get name pops up, I’m telling everyone shitty person is. many women came hitting them, smh. gets away every time.  Wanting socialize one thing. Meeting friends, whatever. get people want that. probably home somewhere outside without much risk, even something happened would least relatively easy find people contact with.

But drive city weekends cafes bars absolutely packed. \*that\* dumb, obvious reasons. I’m gonna lie, first half. crowd distanced outdoors, least seated. comedians hanging case foolish Dumbass 😊 try ro use brain life. that's cloth mask looks virus bit clarification, French went war vietminh, essentially Vietcong Vietcong existed. French got destroyed war 1950s, settle treaty. happened 1954 Geneva conference, wanna search up. formed north south Vietnam, communist north puppet state set French south. split intended temporary Geneva accords set July 1956 Election Day, winner would reunify country rule. Sounds good yeah? End conflict democratically it’ll over, right? Well, didn’t happen. Ho Chi Minh, leader north highly popular, even south Vietnam clear overwhelming victory favour would happened. Now, north communist, didn’t really sit well Americans since brilliant, ultimately false theory going around time called “domino effect” Americans genuinely believed Vietnam becoming communist would caused gradual downfall. So, 400 IQ move making sure democratic election 1956 would never happen. instead put someone called Diem power south held position iron fist, dictator anything else. Americans didn’t mind though since super anti communist pretty much everything Americans wanted do. Anyways, peeps look want, fingers hurt one know anyone know died, hmm. ones need cash most? not-so-civil war then? There’s lots different vaccines developed I’m sure one work sounds like Norovirus coronavirus No, Americans. No, forced conscription without contract-limit. exempt owned 7 slaves. Irrelevant, look deaths per million (aka capita) come back. Spain Belgium pretty bad. like 30 people total hospital. 13 intensuve care.

Why high deaths per capita horrible elderly care system. incapable holding virus bay.

It seems now, got control..

We however. Seeing start looks like second wave. Young, healthy people, going work murdered terrorists thousands bit different pandemic something happened. There's enemy fault. There's perpetrators blame attack back.

I know callous fuck, one would ever actually admit aloud, 300,000 sickly 80+ year olds dying months earlier cause Covid got July instead Flu getting October get people upset vs 25 year old mother 2 young children getting killed work plane flown terrorists. whole life ahead taken force.

Covid tragic circumstance that's happening everyone, there's way fight directly. clear way. everywhere, times. People dissociate bit get day. Fauci, Birx, basically every government health official. saying exact thing.

Actually, made good point beginning masks give people false sense security. general public started wearing masks would less concerned social distancing. right. one remembers saying that. deaths per 1 million. Look top, want live Belgium right now? someone post far lesser flu death numbers 0wn Trumspters? thought two million dead? like condoms. one efficacy rate ""perfect use"", another lesser one ""typical use."" 

Every time person says ""Oh just..."" ""Well, we're family..."" ""It's long enough eat a..."" result creeps closer typical perfect use.

Enough people enough times (and increasingly that) becomes problematic even people well enough time, especially subgroup big event notoriously poorly, goes back groupings less precautions taken (families, etc.) yet president still nothing ""conservatives"" still brushing deaths off.

On behalf world, feel really bad situation. voting makes complicit exactly anti-maskers sound like. lying? Spain Belgium way worse US. Belgium double deaths per 1 million. officially added ww2 Unless paranoid unlikely political scenarios FAR better keep investments home. significant risk, including exchange rates, political turmoil target market etc. really reason financial advisor even consider need diversify globally unless specifically express concern. attempt put numbers perspective. people cannot grasp big numbers without comparison. ever critical others taking precautions? even plan show first place? Nice, serve fatties LOL thought maybe agree people south traitors? politicians got war are? memory serves right lost US citizenship war. Democrats like Carter reinstated US citizenship therefore making Americans again. Good job economic crisis we're currently experiencing, along political tensions local far, think we're going back semblance normalcy nothing delusional. 

Normal, knew 2020, gone. ready New Normal get worse every passing year.

Buckle up. real, guy understand glorious FIRM handshake...probably hurts lil hands lmao. numbers, bodies streets buildings coming down. know contrast smoking, covid19 contagious makes argument invalid? political pressure. source right-wing Republicans. US, politics plague called Covid cannot separated. entwined every level, every part events within US. [Sugar goes many posts mention Trump? people aware virus affecting whole world, US? whole comparison silly disingenuone. US way lower population World War 1. Anyone brain look covid19 death per 1 million stats see US different half europe terms death rate. Spain example worse.

It really shows dishonest redditors spreading nonsense like push agenda. Thats disgusting 🤢 eat home Solution: invade corona specifically that, current policy sure helped considering many protesters/rioters laid months prior due social distancing policies. Nothing fuel flames pissed people can't afford provide families even basic necessities due layoffs. 

You're never going find many people protesting policies might take jobs taken away though, smartest expectation have. Privileged people often difficulty wrapping mind around that, they're either accustomed job positions affected policies, and/or financial safety cushions dampen blow potential unemployment. Pretty much every country Israel

Chinese collectivist - spontaneously dismantled collectives Mao died central government ended going flow. 

The big difference Chinese trust government China currently strong state apparatus, run engineers worked big tech companies established advanced digital infrastructure country past decade.

That's reason Chinese able critical things like a) implement centralised quarantine b) run effective contract tracing program pretty much everyone uses WeChat Alipay. 

Compare West, alternative left-wing Wokeism right-wing libertarianism, explicitly anti-state/ minimalist state. That's things gone shit, tragically. Yeah, really need open up. there's also f\*\*king way hide 1 billion people disease still widely spreading. People willing travel know anyone near got infected recently. Abe Lincoln abolish slavery wagon going while. wrote plenty unequal rights laws war. 
It sucks civil war, birthplace Texas cannot succeed got screwed civil war debts. 1845 TX owned Mexico/France. Texans said hey need help now!? capital do. Said y'all hold entire Mexician army. Xoxo.

Let's wait world leaders actually much shifting responsibility, k? can't blame public goddamn president downplaying severity disease taking mask, addressing white house person, COVID. Sounds like part backlash. wonder none say article  halfway thought SARS-CoV antibodies maintained two years infection US looking quite bad look deaths per capita. Yeah, majority cases 1st 2nd largest provinces. Wow must reading different article one. None description mistakes made Tegnell co  looking profile absolutely convinced one CCP bot.
I gonna say face.. Fuck CCP. proves protests spreading virus. 

Not even Michigan outbreak anti-lockdown protests. point it’s President Jail. Please Even social distancing failing - look Sweden. Yes. letter criticizing Swedish authorities scientific arguments rather scathing childish personal attacks like calling people FHM ""talentless"". Lena Einhorn extravagant filmmaker work biology medicine since early 90s. saw interview BBC moved shack middle forest covid fears would stay like 5 meters away interviewer point needed two microphones. estimate per capita, it’s half testing rate India. COVID, everything, think best make informed decision act it--and beat much situation pans differently--so long look mirror say ""I absolute best get best information could, understand risk(s) others, made decision act accordingly (and updated choices information/risks changed); deviate plan, going best judgement violate ethics social pressure, apathy, laziness, lack preparation, wishful thinking.""

Of course, learn misjudgements misinformation... think particularly constructive allow accept much regret process followed. 

Yes, I'm sad missed *X*, *Y* reasonable information had--and feel good that. me, *X* important following general process/philosophy. ultimately judge action, result(s). 291,000 US combat deaths ww11 Good call. Reported. Well, someone may refuse believe this, one major factors achieving super powerful CCP. CCP organization many people outside China hardly imagine. literally control every corner China. policy made emergency circumstance, enforced even remote village China. campaign, lobby, open debate, press pressure... word - bullshits. think people growing western democracy could possibly accept these.

(Of course, basic information releases like official press release still necessary. Even Chinese people could never tolerate zero visibility. give something.) old article. White House reluctantly approved FDA guidelines day two ago That's true. private test costs around 100€ 😔 Happy Cake day! South depended upon slavery economy. fought maintain economy states' rights. Yes, many also mind slavery. war keep slavery, button maintain status quo. Read comments (and subs posting in)... actually concerning think person might seeing patients capacity. Assuming they're completely full shit.

In one long, barely comprehensible comments alt-right shit hole sub, literally say something along lines ""I'm technically supposed treating people, soul"" (don't comment hand go get link anyone wants it. said history need go far back. first page right now).

If take person face value, see someone entirely unqualified getting paid illegally administer health care people, preying maybe cannot afford insurance. case, person needs reported ASAP. 

Based comments they're either full-on mental break, they've several days meth binge. Seriously, normal ok plan trying get touch someone. comments keep saying they're Texas literally put phone number profile lists different state.  Trump's defense, never plan can't blame response. 

/s want something done half-arsed four months late, yourself... one forced there, I’m sure especially New York understood risk. wouldn’t made choice, everyone allowed make decisions regarding health. Well... except secret service. Yes. Sorry correct say that. bad. rest Swedish bro’s introspective you. defend defend defend. tell everyone else idiots locking down, wearing masks. Sorry that’s experience last 6 months straight  Well CDC says expect close 2k deaths day December January that’s 120k deaths

So easily hit WW2 deaths probably hit million deaths time control Agree, absurd get downvoted Aww, yer feewins get hurt, twat What's nutty despite death still way many people. Probably four hours day; longer colder environments like refrigerated warehouses. think lot known since earlier year - China Korea New Zealand looking imported frozen foods may import virus - west likes pretend nothing known year confirmed US/UK scientists. John Deere hope believe vaccine work - real gain made locking wait vaccine, it.

But vaccine immunity temporary highly limited, then? effect lockdowns delay inevitable, strategy change. land america inhabited traitors needed subdued lot Covid numbers died virus, directly result virus. total number unknown, sadly.  Scientific American ran essay doctor said, “wait—I don’t remember patient actually die Trump going record. dodged war he's bringing casualties war 220000 deaths country alone means nothing? percentage really optimistic. sad situation, Madrid needs stay closed down, there's vaccin maybe.

Millions lives stake excess deaths caused corona virus...

Seems like really flawed way inflating deaths. Come get some, twat full shit that’s insane !!! Nobody blackmailed going Vietnam certainly Charles de Gaulle charge time f***** idiot ! France French troops completely left Vietnam 1957 De Gaulle elected 1958 !!! also never threatened leave nato didn’t go Vietnam otherwise explain send troops 1965 France left 1966 ??? That’s pure American exceptionalism revisionism, anything bad happened imperialist policies it’s never fault !! Lmfao tool open history book behalf Charles fuck This. I've never seen credible source this. seen Snopes debunk though. least point there's significant evidence support it. watched movie theater since like 2015. Maybe 2016 count drive-in. dead business, need theater 4k TV surround sound living room less people get income tax refund. somewhere around 655,000 Americans die heart disease year. Comparing coronavirus deaths casualties wars meaningless. That's actually pretty good point comment literally said fhm majorly fucked up. either didn’t read comment, don’t know fhm (in case really need reading continuing condemn entire nation) stubbornly refuse acknowledge anything doesn’t confirm bias. 

people actually don’t, general, defend him, try clear spread misinformation. saying “hey, words said” example “he saviour champion, dare say word him?”  It’s almost impossible get tested Poland - even symptoms. friends days dozens phone calls trips different hospitals doctors (yes - sick!) took private, expensive test. None people know got tested officially. 
That’s absurd.  compassion people like make bad them. makes better person them.  civil war. definition, parties nation. sort whole reason war... north said south wasn’t allowed secede. Like average dumb American basic arithmetic. think Trump going win Nov, dumb Americans. nothing. Corona real killing people. However, based stories like motorcycle accident, evidence number overcounted. I.e. excess deaths, high reported.

As last note, tell HR. I've chronic headaches coughs past couple months still tell go work. wear mask times, including desk. said, I'm personally scared dying it, rather working. work older people... dont care. bit frustrating, mean get it. 

Note: reposting mentioned color state live got flagged... H1N1 actual pandemic. infected 25% world’s population first year. wasn’t deadly. aren’t pretty good? many U.S. deaths WWII first 9 months?  Seems like obvious, well overdue, piece information need combat virus. sure getting done hey, looking forward findings! meantime, Disney World open since summer. Yes. confederate army also battles union. friends family also need vaccinated, too? Many people know going play waiting game initial roll-out. scientific community feel going hard time convincing public safe beginning. Yes we'll getting prove safe 'the masses' got yet? trials tens thousands people? millions? Whatever is, willing put wave wave men disposal. don’t think anyone’s disputing Sweden going ok now

The person argued literally disputed brought argument graph total deaths entire pandemic. know argument, agree deaths spring much. Sadly, people see nuances issue. trying figure use google?

While looking fast-food edition knowledge, try looking going Ethiopia marxist ethiopian still worked there, might actually learn something. 

Now excuse me, so-called united states time incredibly undereducated people. 

I hope fantastic day. Wait wasn’t originally Obama policy? There's difference, steering wheel car isnt going covered Covid-19, unless Covid-19. Neither keyboard office. 


In public places objects could be, still less likely handling patient objects contact patient.


Also touching Covid-19 virus hands transferring face problem. people touch faces time, even without masks. USA 200k deaths. number could double Americans care. basically waiting game corona passes ww2 deaths. see that.  left SOMEONE alive.... Ugh.... 🙄.... #TakeHim guys always concentrate defending fhm.

People afraid want wear masks distance diligently need ignore actual science listen one constantly lying buffoons' anecdotal evidence.  bad enough White House believe Covid serious really? actively trying harm country whole?? still get drunk home. That’s deserve hospital bed. confusing past present Yes, was.  measures taken mean... think lot reasons phase factory farming, one it, I'm looking silver lining. matter try cover COVID-19 deaths make thinkable political reason. hindsight compare death rates past death rates 2020 2021 easily conclude many excessive deaths suffered virus.

This also uncover collateral deaths like additional suicides due job losses similar, family dramas due lock-down quarantine scenarios, faked pneunomia deaths actually Covid, additional heart attack deaths due overutilized intensive care beds forth on.

Everybody dies eventually, preferably lived long joyous life, seeing kids grandkids grow up, right high school Asian jungle. Well virus emerged China, fair say could handled better beginning. seen rich countries west performed far, don’t think countries would able handle better got hit first. second totally isn’t also genocide carrying brutalizations pro-democracy protestors. /s Gold Star Mothers? traced, figure infected? Nice, nice read, keep mean, Wikipedia puts combined death toll somewhere 129k 226k total. know you, can't really fathom number high comes tangible life. That's lot dead people!  Even suspicious me. indeed get close 1 lakh cases per day, cross large meaningful number... going without much mitigate it. Everything open now.
On per capita basis India bad. reach level US would need finding 3 lakh new infections day. make sense. written India nothing rascism bias. based logic personal experience. England screwed up.

They need EU takeover save citizens . damn Americans sad fucking wimps cant handle little hardship might live.

Wait wimps here? ones stuck sofas actually willing engage genuine human contact other? 

I think people want ban cars cities wimps, imagine little hardship would people get cars take fucking train save many lives many life-years.

Let's call social distancing - social *isolation.* Interpersonal contact human *neccessity.* Fun fact: alive leading cause death humans  Jeez even Singapore playing ponzi scheme game eh?

It's one thing countries lot space push higher fertility rates, countries people effectively live closets trying push it..  LOL! push big beautiful pretend ok obese fact spread people. Also obesity risk covid infections. Obese parents seem spread children know better eat oarents give them. Nothing sad seeing preventable child obesity. might safer indoors haha Eh, know would say that. definitely war, huge cost themselves.

Almost million North Vietnamese died war.

300k South Vietnamese 60k Americans. rapid tests suppose used conjunction guidelines washing, physical distancing, mask wearing White House ignored part. panacea COVID-19. Twitter trumpets every time still say “the hospitals counting every death COVID kickbacks” Sadly you’re getting downvoted “one death many” crowd. ironic believe nationalized healthcare routinely denies life extending procedures older patients. Really makes think much social media affects perception world Yeah War makes lot people rich war dead higher ""value"" put them.

Bonkers much? Nah bro. Fake numbers watch Tucker Carlson ? /s number children died covid line number children usually die regular flu year.

Coronavirus killing older populations people poor health. Fear mongering science. That's happened China - locked Wuhan right Chinese New Year. Shut entire province actually, limited travel across entire country like post comments highlight effectiveness public education. ridiculous. better suggestion would talk much mask public. People walk restaurants remove mask talk storm, saliva flying everywhere. swear virus sense humor. Every thing said debate came around bite ass almost instantly lol Nice. Nah, ""beliefs"" affect people. 210k+ counting dead political ""beliefs"". fuckin red hats killing friends family gleefully. Fuck them. get hide behind ""it's opinion"". *one* ""belief"" hold destroyed life. hope every single red hat burns hell. could simply desert switch sides. Plenty people so, definitely possible. Anyone non paywalled link?  SHEESH ALMOST LIKE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FUCKED PRIVATIZED HOSPITALS BED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FUCK PEOPLE MONEY.


It would really weird that's happening. right? man would bizarre totally unrealistic. Poorly educated parents place little value education produce even less educated offsprings. 

That’s tragic consequence 2020. Nazis confederates aren’t really comparable determining nationality. confederates weren’t fighting “their idea america” fighting total independence. 

Also, no, everyone born south traitor, many actually chose leave south fight union fighting broke out, 100,000 fact. 100% reason remember name. #DumpTheTurdNov3rd okay guys, we'll learn live it, like flu! /s saw chart compared deaths Spanish flu covid-19 April year appeared, comparison chilling. vast majority deaths Spanish flu second wave, current chart shape right line Spanish flu's. Expect see get whole lot worse coming months. don’t know this, especially it’s related confounding factors. someone struggling someone supports struggling. point, people likely stressed they’ve ever longer they’ve ever been, matter mindfulness practice, DBT emotion regulation skill use, regular talk therapy, medication. can’t heal everything. It’s really really hard people mental illness right now.   Social distancing works.  need vaccine. Stop asking meaningless questions help save lives. It’s simple.  Mask up, socially distant use head. lives would saved.  virus HIGHLY transmitted via close contact kills people.  Anyone disputes either ignorant, trying argumentative.  thanks later.  Sounds like natural selection 🤷‍♂️ Orange King welcomes Mar-a-Lago flu comes back year year even vaccine covid new....kinda it’s around new strain. 

Tho Doesn’t help idiots like site puts side side lies force feeds fear mentality people. people really fail understand serious 3% mortality rate is. Let's put different terms, 40 million airline flights per year pre covid, 3% flights result fatal accident, there'd 1.2 million fatal crashes per year, would go flying told 1.2 million planes go every year? reality see 2-3 major airline incidents year, bad year, can't even tell 3/40 million percentage statistic many decimal places. Yet people afraid flying wear mask problem fear covid. Stupidity finest Lack actual healthcare Obamacare’s health extortion scam culls 45,000-68,000 Americans every single year. That’s 360,000-544,000 preventable deaths 8 years. genocidal numbers. 

The “wars” overseas problem, US government two party duopoly war people too?  Ok, outdated info, math. clarification, I'm bit behind think people get ideas fiction? haha They're going come back around rest us they'll fucked hard. Whats money playground closed.  Take take take masks someone said mortality 3% February 2020, could excused, best data moment.

Saying October 2020 ignorance.

Just yesterday estimated 10% world population infected far. 1 million deaths (and even adding 50% account underreporting) real mortality around .2%. Two thousand, three hundred.  Probably not. Plus, there’s early reporting Trump didn’t like getting tested, so...he stopped it. Quick look cdc....the low estimate 229k covid 211k say coronavirus scary (still high recovery rate) lose lot credibility lie something shouldn’t even compared first place  I'm saying parent comment literally purely political. need one false negative work. Oh thank god. comfortably wish death janitor local bank. I’ve always hated cocksucker. Find country works operates like US every way. wont. reason US powerful country world literally every single way. Everyone watches us cameras never miss whats happening here, nobody really cares much rest world cuz arent interested theyre really dont matter much comparison. always worlds super powers throughout history. Thanks! Hope get help anxiety dont even recognize protests big factor spreading covid19? tend agree you, movies experience can't replicated TV screen, least original watch.  buy god damned commemorative coin celebrates Trump defeating Covid-19 White House gift store. Disgraceful. Nothing comment justifies blatently wrong last one. many people wait information (much take years since we're gathering information reinfection quickly) mean acknowledge nonfactual information like anyone certain age die. Looking combat deaths....    
.        
214,938 Americans died combat Civil War. (so we've surpassed this)      
   
291,557 Americans died combat WW2.    
(both conflicts 4 years).    
    
.    
(I think numbers pretty close).     
    
.   
So figure 95 days surpass WW2 combat deaths assuming 800 deaths per day average.    
 
    
.      Amy Coney Barrett needs take cognition test getting **lifetime** appointment supreme court. suffering Brain fog cognitive issues disqualifying. ACB hid COVID earlier year last week. Annnnnnnnnnnnd that's need popular vote matter electoral, everyone needs able equal representation casting votes. Everyone's vote counts comes popular vote. which, popular makes actually see people want office. rigging votes away states vote one way representative voting way illegal 50 states.

And cities control popular vote, there's plenty demographics across cities far wide go around, representatives confirm way states' electoral votes go control electoral vote, bad. That's equal representation. That's straight fraud. ballots cast, counted, one one, determine wins popular vote. unnecessary count twice hold secondary poll that's controlled state reps.

And cities contribute control electoral vote? Like said, population density major factor, would obviously swing electoral votes. equal access polling places one side stopped trying move get rid existing locations, perhaps would see people vote? mention people vote system makes believe vote make difference, honestly doesn't. bad? didn’t know difference beforehand? amount people don’t know it’s would/could astounding. 

The US needs teach English better. lot Americans huge problem you’re, their, they’re their, would/could have. Read wrote again.  

I never said Mr. Orange given wrong information. said conveyed information given truthfully, per Fauci himself.  

His direct quote  “I didn’t get sense distorting anything. discussions him, always straightforward concerns had. related him. would go out, I’d hear discussing sort things.” author taken number reported deaths divided reported cases get 3%.

It pretty rough everyone knows actual numbers way reported figures. understand one thing. countries reporting deaths covid19? Cause TB kills 1.5 million appro every year. number covid19 deaths 1.05 million. year end could go max 1.3- 1.4 million. reporting covid19 deaths tb deadlier covid19?? I’m sure undermined much government people advisors breaking social distancing rules suffering consequences. Thank much posting Oh, duh, reason thought something expected COVID spread something. *Oooooooh we're half way there...* It’s really weird seeing people Reddit seemingly relishing lockdown requirements. understand it’s necessary thing, seem actively enjoy complying. Idk they’re getting feeling “civic duty,” whatever, either way it’s really fucking creepy. r/coronavirus full them.  Wait, Union soldiers died Confederates? pregnant women even going qualify vaccine? I'm pretty sure demographic going receive initial vaccine. Especially since coronavirus shown bad pregnancy (unlike flu extremely hard pregnant women). Pence strikes kind guy tries keep far away trumps shenanigans possible. He’s GOP safety net all. Democrats: “They’re peacefully protesting.” 😂 subreddit change policy towards politics 🤔 Wonderful Princess Bride reference. think thought actual post-apocalyptic world excites much. they're defeatists.  Dismantle it. Throw trash. need archaic party anymore. sexy fuck.. doubt that. Haha, accent really gets going too! logistic problems Bangladeshi side. Sometimes local contractors employed government overestimate ability fill roles big projects. Sinovac already successfully tested vaccine countries. even listen social distancing BS anymore, live life normally wear mask required me, still caught COVID yet, one know it, I've tested antibodies. 


You can't expect everyone live life like this. Yes, downvoted saying care stupid fucking internet points. Let guess... Troll 🐢 don’t spread Covid. LOL Okay reposted without dig R*****s Libe*****s, thanks Automod. Go eat dick, brian talking American deaths instances deaths? Cause it’s deaths someone math right counting American deaths still math wrong. 280k American soldiers died Vietnam total deaths million. 211k died due covid. Korean War total 5 million died 40k Americans died. 288k Iraq war 109k American. Iraq much lower I’ve able find 2000 give take world war 1 sorta still argued many people died according one site also lists least 6 13 million 117k American. 

Enough fear mongering it’s pitiful point April July cherry picking finest. would assume asked question ask? specifically asked ""*is given*"" followed statement Orange distorted hidden misrepresented info given virus

because question wording emphasized ""info given"" part quote. wants fact-checking sensible silver fox Bon Scott voice them? 😍 Actual quote: ""I learned lot Covid. learned really going school. real school, 'let's-read-the-book school'. imagine president ever said, “if undecided vote ain’t black.” understand one thing. countries reporting deaths covid19? Cause TB kills 1.5 million appro every year. number covid19 deaths 1.05 million. year end could go max 1.3- 1.4 million. reporting covid19 deaths tb deadlier covid19?? Maybe problem world actually senile old men running it. Lets see happens. Plus percentage America flu past 5 years? Compared COVID far. fail see issue. implication 33Mil people caught Corona? think count uninfected 97% lived sound like anti-vaxxer. Democrats taken virus seriously, could saved tens thousands.

Cuomo know long term consequences long time.

People going follow rules now, think wait see happens 3-5 years going back normal? Ok that's great period time confederacy government, army, flag. americans war. measures like masks cancelling big indoor events etc would probably necessary, lockdowns, especially early on, debatable. Especially considering literally every country world imposed them, matter local situation, longer realistic option majority them.
And saying ""You can't really contribute economy dead"" course irrelevant context, considering IFR virus probably lower 0.5%, hardly kills people productive age - countries average age deaths covid around 80, similar higher average age people die general  Relevant username. 
Petri dish. say nothing it? geographic isolation definitely helps quarantine system, still many people claiming Auckland outbreak suggested eradication strategy waste time (as countries gone downhill outbreak e.g., Aussie). 

The fact quickly stamped suggests eradication strategy viable countries. OK, hard time seeing graph. Thanks. monkeys might fly outta ass I've reading vietnam bit lately, essentially north south odds ever since french left 1954, however america join 1962
(Someone please correct wrong) eat mouth, whore bag ? true. Sadly know there's lot Redditors impact all, can't comprehend big deal people. life without family, culture, connections, etc, worth living lot people, least multiple years. People look risk differently taken away longer times. make morally inferior redditors never leave house lives anyway.

The arts, particularly performance arts, sadder state authoritarian dystopias propaganda, *no one's talking it.* needs culture got Zoom, Fortnight, free PornHub account? 1% takes consideration higher death rate beginning, increased deaths hospitals overwhelmed. Pretty sure Florida isn’t going list places go would also imagine it’s pretty frustrating spending 30+ years building running business, bureaucrat shut prefer stay home. first world countries too. talking Trump Christie? I’m high risk, completely quarantine. go doctor (my outings) wear N95 P100, days I’ll go drive know strict masks (real exciting know). wipe groceries still, change clothes shower come out. another high risk friend I’d actually happy hang them, don’t, feel rest friend’s family’s choices risky. I’m making best quarantine gonna keep sucking getting by. scientists represent mainstream science. Kinda like two doctors California. Explain, words, flatten curve meant Dude, people sending death threats *his family*. 

Take homeless situation Senate. They're ones refusing relief. Imagine arguing cancer patient that’s rebounding chemo beating cancer (Congress) want stop chemo cancer gone, it’s chemo hurts more.

Oh, “we” responsible cancer first place. Whether that’s true long since departed predecessors, not.

Don’t get wrong - parts job immensely rewarding. real name isn’t attached accomplishments - like ghost writer, part job someone else’s name “on cover.” line entire time virus fake big deal. sudden say ‘I’m really sick it’s big deal” would make look dumb , say least 

I guess talked seeing correct . base pardoned tolerated worse. see different doctors. Deaths despair - suicides increased dramatically, along ODs. Coronavirus isn’t thing kill drank Kool-Aid. Well take seriously certainly possible. oooo yeah, fuck guys. already hidden downvoted commented, oops He's occasionally wrong. go list? Right. detention centres. ""only"" 4 times cumulative cases presumably keeping cases open whereas Australia closing patient recovers. FDA &amp; CDC even get covid-19 tests weeks months pandemic; did, sent contaminated tests, tests work.

Even individual state governors begging FDA let use test kits purchased countries, FDA banned American government response pandemic nothing disastrous. failure upon failure, failure. Half time incompetence, half corruption malice. news US government stealing supplies state governors ordered state money. problem US government failed secure PPE countries managed secure.

Our president infected, he's infected almost entire White House, bunch people, he's TV still saying nothing, worry it.

You really going trust US government point?

Beyond single stimulus pay out, government done everything could screw us hard possible. They’re physical barrier....is question people really ask??? mean, happens weather prediction time. uncommon hurricane season evacuation areas change time get information storm moves. mean NWS incompetent, means hurricanes, even though dozens year, perfectly predictable.

And likewise, sometimes need stage evacuations make sure everyone gets time. honest fault leaders saying mask shortage, buy disposable masks. social distancing/stay inside recommendation well effect then, that's lot effective mask own. yes money. People need order eat keep roof heads.

I ask this: 400,000 Trump-supporting, non-mask wearing people went Sturgis 1 guy died, safe open? u still alive? think won’t wrong masks wrong bandanas ? one good ones I'm sure. think expect profit driven system recognize value human beings, even good business practice. think oriented towards short term profit gives tunnel vision. could see simply burning lot medical professionals even recognize problem, acknowledge all. problem ignoring harmless conspiracies mental weaknesses, ignorance, paranoia, prejudice, magical thinking cause also cause people believe harmful things. Personally, thinking cone silence Get Smart series. Like ones based science? really sad depths guy fell order remain relevant massively shifting Republican party. first time sub I’m seeing story lady killing someone breaking social distancing? Yes scientists satanic pedophiles want kill people worldwide affect US election. /s reuse masks often possible hospital. time got use one per night working Covid floor. manager sent twice fit tested, told unit secretaries need immediately turned away. took floor three hours get newly diagnosed positive patient floor. circus. “People aren’t homeless coronavirus, they’re homeless response it.”

Clever, deaths! due locking too?! Oh, bet zoom meetings nowadays. Last time checked, luck locally, handful none worked me.

Right I'm going see therapist + dietitian works. worked early 30s, though managed keep weight like 5 years. thing many, many things I've tried worked, least one try. I'm definitely making mental note put list check need support, thanks!  u wash reuse masks? country barely masks available unfortunate forgotten seen example Covid-19 you, regardless. beg though?  Chickens stacked top shitting bad, chlorination, antibiotics well leads antibiotic resistance. focusing making crops efficient hydroponics, artificial lighting, stacked farming, greenhouses on. I'm interviewing med school months. get in, that's 4 years school possibly another 4 years residency training. final stage training died. decades schooling, died COVID, living breathing medicine crazy resident schedule. robbed life worked ass achieve what? enough PPE? California can't print money, like economies sovereign states can. There's way realistic surplus come close covering loss tax sales revenue. Allez, courage mon vieux. Romania also added yestarday corona risk list.. close closing everything us like leaving houses going movies. 

I like house time. Movies one things love. 

I'm bummed can't go (I refuse go rather) sucks. Watching home people like me. matter many times people say is.  I'm surprised works people. literally can't interact anyone except partner following area's guidelines cohorting one know ACTUALLY cohorting. smaller gatherings may meet regularly 10 fewer different people, 10 people exclusive social bubble - everyone still meets people outside group.  


The stress &amp; depression social interactions outside household, anxiety comes people pressuring hang ""live life"" way intense keep living way. can; attend small gatherings, less frequently, try meet one group two week period, stay away everyone know risk wear masks/distance work public. petulant OMG aunt hilarious. :D Slowly Covid makes balls hurt. literally spends day posting politics shitting trump people like lockdown. dude's brain fried. There's lot people vested interest- idle hobby- fear mongering. Hi. live West Coast Canada. avoid gathering meeting person anyone outside bubble (6 people total). go walks, groceries work. work behind plexiglass interactions. couple times week go Starbucks drive through. cafes, restaurants, bars etc. wear mask everywhere.

I level since March 16.

We canceled Thanksgiving, Halloween Xmas, except home celebrations immediate household family. .

Of two kids, one attends school person, part time. school tiny, 60 students. outdoors/ nature based school. distanced masked.

My dad died April Care Home outbreak. funeral. travel see family then. 

Where live, slightly strict average, general, level precautions normal. 

My province 5 million people currently recording around 100 cases day 1.3% positivity rate. consider surge. Wow. 

Like ""nah. mask save life. I'll fucking kill purpose.""

But literally. call one actually gets sick People start eating bats. would world's fifth largest economy need financial aid?

Or California's economy actually mainly tied corporations' finances government lacking cash reserve? like magical thinking, believing ***everyone else's job get sick***. 

And that's Repubs Magas super spreaders cause get it, believe &amp; keep mouth breathing everyone saying additional illness loss life caused opening everything up, opposed maintaining restrictions, worth of...money? Hrm, I've tried phentermine, tolerate help take month every years. It’s deaths though. Plenty people recover suffering. ok wear mask infect someone may suffer greatly, even though survive? also don’t know long term repercussions won’t while. I’ve attacked every angle trying that. I’ve called names I’ve never even heard political year.

I enjoy research learning new things, even told people would research something didn’t understand it.

It depressing first, still know better probably even now. 

Data, science, actual reality stupidity online.

Can’t argue someone’s beliefs point beliefs shifted religion social media’s spread misinformation. minority opinion, concensus opinion. good. Election year. site  probably lie themselves, say ""but Black, cancer (even though he'd apparently beat 2006), etc. Denial real coping mechanism, tool use outsiders arguments. One fave quotes one Gavin de Becker:

""*Denial interesting insidious side effect. peace mind deniers think get saying isn’t so, fall take worst happens far, far greater accept possibility. Denial save-now-pay-later scheme, contract written entirely small print, long run, denying person knows truth level, causes constant low-grade anxiety. Millions people suffer anxiety, denial keeps taking action could reduce risks (and worry). “It’s like waking house room full smoke, opening window let smoke out, going back bed.*""  Yeah shutting country spread still controllable suppression possible great idea. PRC, AUS NZ shown work. RoK even w/o shutting down. Problem Western nations far beyond point. Food deserts commonly found inner cities...where chain food stores don’t makes mad. Wowow He's state epidemiologist main man responsible herd immunity strategy Sweden, following tragedy.

He's wrong caught lying countless times.  mean excuse? Obviously longer economy remains closed harder recover it. econometric math it. States restricting right bleeding money tax revenue. think Fauci praised NY's reopening shits giggles? hoping see seated round table, three plexiglass radii coming center, two vp candidates moderator. Harris wanted put ""ceiling"" it, maybe air filtration system third, would work. Trumpist literally dumbest people ever lived, it'd almost impressive perpetuating fucking pandemic. know got definition from, mine surprise also type double trivial things instead expanding actual knowledge.  tiny fringe group one takes seriously. like citing Lomborg show support climate change denial Behe support creationism.

It's inaccurate dishonest. Umm, shouldnt US EU accept vaccine like end November. mocking? 

Countries gotten covid control going lives. example, one Vietnam taken tourist couple days ago. wrong rest world getting back normal America screwed up? Cables kits stock warehouse right now. It’s local (to me) company, owner actually chartering flights PPE straight factories. They’re reliable, they’re office supply company. Probably big brain wizard occasionally wrong.
The man says hundreds facts week based data studied decades. Sometimes things incorrect. broken clock right twice per day, opposite also true.



I'm glad massive brain never, ever mispoke said anything error, ever received bad information, us mortals, make stupid mistakes sometimes. Nobody perfect, except you.



I tell frequent posting ""China Flu"" sub obviously expert. style governance modeled mayor Jaws, believe big ass shark water. went movie someone refused answer cell phone tell person ""I'm movie. Can't talk right now.""

I never wanted punch someone badly life. 

Never again. completely agree. people involved conspiracy, harder keep secret. Every doctor, nurse, virologist, epidemiologists PLANET it?

Not mention people died families. families conspiracy? murder? feel sorry people terrifying world must think it’s true. believe every health care professional planet would engage this? believe humanity evil.

The lack critical thought astounding. Thanks! “It’s year 2022, people same, they’ll anything get need. need Soylent Green.” got back Lake Laoigai? really want covid virus GOPs imagination. Real covid sucks badly. would amazing hoax, wouldn’t it? mean, completely understand people want believe gop one. makes ens evil.  they’ll pray god faith actual evidence exists, completely disregarded fact whole world dealing pandemic. lol would far preferred option. Pretty good chance even (severe) symptoms. Give credit - got far away Donnie &amp; DC Shit Show could w/o needing passport. Welcome America. Little House Prairie, Andy Griffith, Leave Beaver, ... People saying 'roids given. I'm sure tell checks little know steroids.  Canada, you’re required quarantine 2 weeks due COVID exposure, you’re eligible receive $500/week benefit 2 weeks cover expenses. might make entire lost wages, it’s certainly insignificant. see sub regularly. They're convinced new reality forever Summer probably mass vaccinations begin. probably lag fall. Lmfao.  wouldn’t passed anything anyway, don’t worry much. focus pushing Supreme Court nomination through.  added bonus senators blame soon voted president That's healthy bar set. understand that's good bar set? Wait fire able perform expected. He's bypassing anything everything sake political points election. things need politicized, like mask mandate lockdowns. Yet sycophants making red vs blue issue. actually followed guidelines set Day CDC, US would much better shape today infection rate economy would probably panicking second wave right like countries (but still better shape) considering another lockdown. Instead first wave never stopped snowballed states got first wave getting hit hard second wave.

This would never happened president history. president ever, right mind, would go pandemic expert onset pandemic. insane happen. People joked proof we're heading realm movie Idiocracy reality right worse movie. movie ended smartest person planet gave solutions survival getting elected office. reality showing that, significant number people, person made things worse still preferable someone else stood 'wrong' group. get tested beforehand, thats exception thats mentioned people already large enough established networks. It’s fair ask people go without human contact year half. Normally would considered cruelty. certainly babies actually result failure thrive. Yep, used say, ""Ooops!"" ""collateral damage"" sounds professional. looked like trying grab extra air balcony removing mask last night. one saw that?  bad best way enforce social distancing LOCKDOWN! Idiots! right, winter coming... could known! **could** kill 10 million people... probably That's heinous when's regular guy says it, even joking fucking politicized despicable republicans catastrophe destroy GOP less month. deserve far worse. Haha 14 days locked hotel room! gonna pay loss income? selfish prick. wonder many staff working Republican events start showing work full mask, gloves, goggles, etc.   imagine Bush posted Terrorist season coming up! Many people every year, sometimes 100,000, despite Military/Police, die Terrorism. going invade another Country? No, learned live it, like learning live 911, populations far less lethal!!!

Rofl  White seems kinda sus. cool.....flying vegas tomorrow (for work). Wish luck! Hoping us. supposed get married year third rescheduled date September 2021. looking promising big wedding, guess, likely done waiting. What's current border situation Shenzhen Hong Kong? Easy travel, restricted sides, quarantine/test (?) Really? know that. wonder initial wave later waves, sense primarily devastating younger populations. 

Looks like need dive history Spanish flu...  I’m curious type guy walks flock seagulls mad get Bird sh!t you?

You realize I’m referring deadly virus fears killing wife child, that’s whole point, won’t get rid people esp current president spreading like fire. 

Now really shut adults talking. What’s pos?   miss vacations...
I miss going theme parks without antimaskers spewing covid...
I want son school...
I want visit family, located 3, 5, 15 hour flights...
I want go sorts restaurants including buffets revolving sushi...
I want go shows...
I want museums open...

Can't wait damn vaccine. Steroids Vote. US 800,000 people die heart disease U.S. year.

This also wars. killing old people?

Duh... Hope 'thats wrap' go round.... Oh boy Americans gonna like one COVID lot quickly too. 

From Wikipedia: 
\- Vietnam war 19 years

\- Korean war 3 years

\- Iraq war 8 years

\- Afghanistan war - 19 years counting

\- WWI - 1 year nearly 45,000 deaths 110,000 coming Spanish Flu.

That's 50 years war vs 3/4 year COVID. You’re totally delusional think following rules incredibly strictly perfectly “risking killing people”. clear safe isn’t going cause lot less death saying it’s either nothing nobody gather holidays even they’re totally quarantined weeks traveling private car. We’re incredibly aware risk, (which life always is, even getting car) everything make sure we’re spreading virus way. realize everyone isolate home time lot people essential workers? also said it’s foolproof life happens people could lie, we’re still minimizing risk. Don’t high mighty pretending staying home much different 8 people staying home weeks perfectly safe according health experts. honest chose 👍 still like 40% approval. good part country gone insane still matter happens Trump. Sit inside rest life then, get delivery work online. fine then. ashamed judging thinking I’m downplaying death general. That’s ASSumption don’t know me. I’m simply pointing facts one wants actually read. get butt hurt that’s said ashamed myself. 🤷🏻‍♂️ amazing fucking epiphany....thanks Trump going contract trace.

WE paid illness care. I’m fine wearing masks foreseeable future public scenarios. don’t need show face grocery store subway car. “social distancing” mean keeping many businesses closed public events minimum, there’s way make late 2021. Obviously personal level miss friends, family, pre-COVID daily social activities, etc. forgo things means keeping fellow man healthy. 

That said, economic collapse we’re facing due pandemic startling. whole nightmare really exposed vulnerable economic system is. Beyond obvious reduction business subsequent layoffs fields directly impacted pandemic (travel, hospitality, service), there’s massive slowdown nearly every field work due indirect impact. massive unemployment making matters worse. City, State, Federal tax revenue plummeted compounding issue. I’m worried long term impact shutdowns. 

I don’t answer criticizing social distancing measures understand necessity flatten curve. guess I’m pointing situation nuanced usual arguments see subs, I.e. one person saying “I miss partying friends bar!” response “we never go back bar COVID eradicated!” clinical trials right now. Trump one 10 people (can cite source needed) get outside trials. first data came 275 people reported reduced viral load time alleviate symptoms. Pun intended? worries, Trump install Kushner eight star general Pentagon perfectly fine -tweeted Herman Cain's personal account Well depends US state. well not. Trump's superpower able find employ people dignity. doctor probably people's respect point. Oh well.  ...Jesus Christ.

Time meaning place.  That’s actually listen. Probably longer since America cares going movie theater caring helping others live deadly virus. 

Mask fuckin idiots. I’d yell conservative sub instead banned ask questions. fuck you’re reading this. “understand “ market much next investor doesn’t tease directly Floor bubble may well in. 

The Fed dumping trillions dollars funny money economy may propping could secure foundation think 

Either way way extended anything absorb hit three 

I bottom dollar willing go sell interesting see bear market flips hard Honestly can’t imagine picking potential lifelong health issues preventable virus infancy kid grow socially awkward. course don’t mean sound judgmental personally would rather kid shitty socialization skills live healthy adult. get COVID isn’t death sentence still far many unknowns expose exposure’s sake IMO. Melbourne. Honestly, long I'm almost ready join fuckwits screaming freedom. Much longer might snap. telling elites think. condone think horrible.

But really think Bezos (or whichever rich person) cares people working him?  Hahn earned respect. He’s really trying right. easy compare

Sweden Source Sweden's urban areas 42% dense, also higher percentage population living there.

It pretty obvious Sweden dense America. America one least dense developed countries famous that. sure hard concept grasp. see car dominated infrastructure. Things spread apart here. Imagine paying 200/100 K get COVID. branch military enlisted in? paid $200,000 couple $100,000 per person

uh, thanks?  current administration: lives matter.

Also current administration: 215,000 deaths nbd. keep nightmare something keeps scratching pushing sheets. sleep blanket top last night 4th 5th time month. first, around 1am 3am last night 6:40am. pretty terrifying tbh

anyone experience? fucking reddit weirdos something else. Death rate way beginning. treatments better, decent portion population gotten immune know risk groups. Less people dying. weird fetish fantasy wanting thousands Americans die every day government declare martial law excuse stay inside house fucking weird. Deaths Pneumonia without covid total number. means 194,000 deaths “involving” . 94% deaths conditions like...🤔...pneumonia. counting deaths without covid pneumonia related deaths. clicking yet? anyone trump's twitter feed past hours? manic episode?

Dont forget food eat like almost poison........... yummy recent pew research release (though poll data set time period), it’s naturally headline time around. US global opinion research release last month definitely remember headlines time.  Defense home duty honor seemed strong primary reasons enlisting average Confederate soldier.

The whole system creaking groaning, sides blaming cause. also know treat Spanish flu, barely could treat symptoms. lot variables take consideration comparing numbers. Tired ""winning"" yet? hell ""making America GREAT again""? Wait what? vaccine ever significantly impacted melanin skin? ""lmao"" - Sun Tzu. What’s take? good 30 million unemployed even need relief package sure, totally is. make us number 1? Trump said nothing worry about. said majority? beforetimes I'd go average movie week- several Regal theaters range house.

Haven't one since February feel comfortable sitting one even anything see. 任务完成！ shut fuck nuts majority mutually exclusive. 1% would still nuts. fact country slavery nuts. 27% isn’t majority Idk, think entire conflict based around group considering part america anymore, least good argument could made.

We don’t consider American revolution internal British war, George Washington traitor. Coronavirus Trump -FTFY Yeah, lose voter base even more.

Covid-19 3100% deadlier combat revolutionary war. study recently halted neurological issues? use Google. Dang! chose expatriate part union. That's awfully misleading headline. :v That's...

That's doing. America's major involvement start 1964-65, tend start discussion war. big Vietnam movies tend use music late 60s early 70s, think even embedded American culture war long was, although lived (and especially didn't) might different viewpoint.

This civility issue; human issue. guy sees others subhuman worth dignity respect. Strongest economy history.  think counting excess deaths since February compared year would inaccurate say directly related financial collapse (this number anywhere 214,865 - 285,404) excess death directly related covid, knowing (misdiagnosis, overcrowded hospitals, financial crisis, loss access services) would almost impossible. can't imagine finding root death things like stress starvation would easy (both usually heart attacks, could covid complication) deaths based loss services even complicated. Ex: losing financial stability buy insulin, die. Loss travel/expenses entertainment/socialization allowing rapid progress degenerative neurological diseases, die. Loss electricity, die heat, cold, poor hygiene. counted financial relation? Probably not, person would need thorough death eval that. Excess death starting might accurate, still account quarentine measures. Truly, never know toll financial aspect disease. Bummer, local Regal Pennsylvania great. decades movie-going, problem staff.

Working home going little possible real way stop spread. suppose that's possible everyone, pandemic passed we've built immunity/developed vaccines, event taken lesson populate areas densely interact strangers less often (going bars, concerts, etc.) Specifically, interest rate reversal Dec 2018. lowered interest rates reduces people willing lend increases people willing borrow. Eventually, amount borrowers higher enough compared lenders create liquidity crisis, Fed started printing money (Not QE). Keep mind Federal Reserve printing money prior Covid-19, order create stock market bubble tampering debt markets.  AFAIK maintenance worker didn’t infect anyone else, rubbish bin incident involved 2 3 people shut down. cases, happened later anyway, aren’t considered relevant Auckland cluster started.

Many weren’t even American. quarter union forces immigrants. people responsible coming science we’re supposed listen to. people stupid take election, that's them. People killed war mainly 19 year old healthy kids whole lives ahead them.

The 'eff them' attitude 'eff YOU' 60-80. cool story, bro can’t tell point, think point flu vaccine didn’t work, effectively may well gotten vaccine. And, still, 60K vs 200K deaths. stated that? seems making shit prove point artificially creating... Coming soon r/darwinawards near you. super harsh lock (no grocery shopping, allowed leave house pick grocery delivery) 76 days, install super invasive contact tracing app every time anyone goes anywhere need scan code tracked later, test non-healthcare workers every two weeks, mass-test entire cities can't identify source newest domestic cases.....yeah plausible seeing actually going on. family says life back normal except masks still required public places. medical concern right COVID, got that? Everything else like heart disease, cancer, strokes matter. takes certain type idiot realized back March.

I like 1 5 people saw Costco wearing mask first day everyone panic buying.

It literally can't hurt wear mask, fucking wear fucking fuck fuck mask. Covid ally, probably protected thousand needless deaths It’s leading antibiotic resistance, going bring disease eventually.  Vampires likely spread diseases spend less mirrors. think people think Covid flu don’t care numbers facts. keep repeating false claims. 4,150,000,000 projected fuck? troll intentionally trying spread disinformative happy talk? know happened six. declared, basis, confirmed second cases mild, information 50% are. objectively stating falsehood spreading misinformation. understand that? respect that, given reason we've severely restricted freedom means making money (for lot people), feel like want take risk give charade open up.

Cuomo also power. COVID started made openings closing done him. di Blasio make suggestions/advise wants done NYC, Cuomo make official. OnlyHereForDaNews make irrelevant comment completely missing point


""Well, least tried, Great work Cooks! :D"" Don’t worry. Christie’s moose knuckle defeat covid.

I agree probably pangolin... time. conspiracy joke. attempt claim snipers actually enforcing mask orders.  Also, recognized Leslie's hard work passion even thought ultimately disagreed almost things. worked PANYNJ went down. coworker sitting next ordered org subpoena turn guy(David Wildstein?)'s account credentials investigation. closest I've ever important.

Social isolation large portion childhood life long consequences. live far family can't see restrictions family missing lot things. compliant restrictions far, compliant much longer. feel like sacrificing mental wellbeing financial stability 3 generations 1 generation live little longer. even whole generation too, small bit would catch virus, even tinier bit would die it. fast approaching point covid longer dangerous thing play. actually follow scientists listen social distancing guidelines.

did watch video? see crowds people indoors without masks?

like actual proof said? I’ve working home since March. city went 1,100 cases day 150 day. Although state lying numbers sneaking back logs. don’t know single digit numbers would give mental break even then, it’s likely there’s undetected cases. won’t matter. Trump lost friend (Stanley Chera), ally (Herman Cain) probably brother COVID-19 yet still tells America ignore it. base believe whatever tells them. ""Two"" hospital beds. see there! Like 95% Australia uninhabited, people evenly distributed throughout country. lot virus one thing common, people eating shouldn't. China got SARS thing happening 2002, learned? Nothing, continued eat shouldn't.

Guess must imagined hundreds thousands articles past 6 months saying exactly that. could much easier less headache would link source. Good luck that. probable scenario minority pre-paid doses going needed.

Edit: earth would want 30 day delay two inactivated vaccines? Corona takes away every evidence based scientific thought. dunno. need sane person tell there's point replying comments Facebook ads elsewhere, people violently anti-mask calling ""plandemic / scandemic"" etc.

How much use telling ""please stop spreading misinformation"" using logic like ""if masks problem, healthcare workers would dropping like flies"", attention span 3 year olds re-post memes ad nauseam, regardless say?

Tuesday numbers came in

4500 new cases day.

That makes 40.1 per 100k people.

Not exactly great perspective ask me. That's complete fucking nonsense. mask requirements populated counties, people followed part. Stop bullshit. Socially distancing wearing masks isn’t lockdowns. Herd immunity achieved vaccination still know happens people who've covid line.
Besides, people confirmed contracted once. Masks social distancing stay forever. Guess we're gonna need 3rd party That’s shocking! thought young people couldn’t get sick. still infect old people they’re around young people it? It’s almost like thing virus. CNN Dr. Reiner said nearly certain virus debate given time onset symptoms.

And, fact release date last negative test also damning indication.

And 'next man up' deputy press secretary brass balls say Whitehouse knows control virus. pants somehow spontaneously immolate real mystery.  total deaths US currently around 40% total deaths Spanish Flu. Worse. Im sure isnt brought up. shouldn’t taken seriously right doctor needs charged enabling America? So, many.

Third Mr. Stephens’ death initially believed COVID-19 complications, according Facebook post Tuesday Central Catholic. Wednesday, school said “mistakenly attributed death without official confirmation cause” apologized error.

Fourth one campus unrelated infections directly attributed campus school distance statement said Juan campus expose university community virus.

So overall they’re sad unfortunate, three sources could actually read, one labeled Covid death, wasn’t even campus. student getting infected dying disprove “0 students died it” left-leaning right-leaning friends mine said May June 2021 breaking point say screw restrictions masks places (they wear vaccination, 2022 whatever)

Dude Herman Cain died end July, account still posting often. Yeah, trumps mind gone. 🤦‍♀️ I'm seriously considering buying face shield go along mask extra safe. wear glasses I'm sure helps, wearing shield difficult anything would give peace mind. ""its politics"" yeah every nation fucking world it. heard Batman got (how’s doing? Anyone know?) ... Bond too!! 😢 Dude, living highrise 2 weeks ago feel you. Dudes would see elevator invite in. elevator packed 10 people, maskless one even coughed. can’t tell much started despise people there.

The main issue claiming religious persecution.

They live mental bubble yes fail realize physical bubble. 99% chance surviving it. bigger issue is:

Why many Americans unhealthy, change that? still can't believe dude (who 40s seems normal weight), went national TV try tell world obese president 70s healthier was.

It unbelievably pathetic Death Cult. Last quarter growth China +8% US -9%. Following trend, soon China surpass US GDP...

Such bullshit.   expect?  asshole directly made decision blame? They're never going let Bernie nominee. profit health insurance exist born. Thanks republicans, course. Spanish flu killed 600k Americans 50 million people worldwide. Comparing war pandemic retarded.  Hey, fear though. Trumpublicans keep trying prove Covid-19 big deal, keep failing spectacularly. No, I’m actually curious find proven. I’ve gone one time since pandemic started outdoors. 

So you’re going make statement, please back evidence. Tyson pure evil stop watching time let rest us like weird shit enjoy peace. Ssshhhh, let people think populist wealth taxes actually work (even though concept abandoned almost OECD countries various reasons). Norwegians followed Sweden's ""expertise"", would lot dead Norwegians.

Oh, forgot, allowed mention front you. Go back conspiracy. Deaths subsequent result pandemic, yes do. dont know moved away valuing labor something morally admirable. need get back concepts made country was. ""Anybody willing work fulltime job entitled middle class life""

Weird people... Hi! I'm looking Figure 2 Spanish Flu outbreak. appears deaths per population exceeding 100 figures. misreading that? Hahahahah! 2 beds! means time call sizewise! r/onefatstack might surprised pea-brained computer programmers actually are. industry made lucrative business charging civilians busywork begets busywork, thus creating need replaceable, mediocre programmers. Germany hospitalized went already 200 400 one week. Consume. Don’t argue. Mandatory masks. Mandatory vaccine. Mandatory tracking chip. Close small business. Buy online. Rich guys get richer. safety. realize estimated amount 45M infections year? means 45M COVID cases would 1.2M deaths. calculating taking account hospitals would explode many cases deaths. 

And would mean covid 50x lethal flu. said, many infections hospitals max capacity death rate would also way higher. population 330 million dude. Unless within 33% approximately? developed mental problems means everybody is. I'm dealing fine quarantine. That’s terrible idea many fronts. Look weekend update segment first Quarantine show did. remote laughter awful. Additionally, stage performers, need energy inform performance. wrong, fact we're testing lot covid flu. reality different flu. Excess deaths expected best way tell right now. going 4x like flu, like 1.5x lower said done. bother they're bothered? wake bezos' dick mouth? Ignorance worst pandemic least one person died, too, paramedics stuck traffic couldn’t get time Let's say average lifespan 70 years. means 114 million people die every year, 313K people per day, Yea... tried “make us” wear masks look are. want double prices meat? WW3??? think thats pretty fair point. Can’t fix stupid 60% Swedes still support Tegnell.

Most Swedes *are* nutjobs. never understand people straight say Coronavirus isnt real. mean PEOPLE LOST LIVES!!! Like sort inhumane people would lie that????? TAX POLICY ?

In Germany (where currently live) , pay almost 40% average income tax average salary professional half professional earns US.  


Don't kid thinking poor billionaires paying less tax. dangerous path go people caught Covid start winning. I'm sure plenty cases company crap job maybe fault. line keep moving dangerous goes far either way. 

The precedent set needs really thought out. better phase population growth.
 
 
Unfortunately factory farming necessary evil. ...bill burr on...

Nope, killing thought. humbling Herman Cain/coronavirus timeline:

7/2: Tests positive Covid-19

7/15: Says doctors seem happy


7/27: Says he’s really getting better


7/30: Dies reduce food supply carefully monitored food animals. Whilst allowing continuing capture sale wild animals ""wet markets"" 

Sure help /s daughter literally licked window airport... definitely know people eaten sharks.. I'll use different example. Someone dies heart attack afterword they're found Covid body. understanding death would counted Covid death, even though passing may anything Covid. apply means death, eaten shark. link something showing idea propaganda zero merit? odds least one GOP jackasses gonna punch ticket. bet takers?

 mean ignore health codes all.
Just getting peeved constant grooming fear. ***god’s chosen*** 

&amp;#x200B;

just like Twitter Chief aka Chosen one? That's way lower would expected. Since got lucky enough asymptomatic despite taking care someone quite bad two weeks without protective equipment, odds catching short encounter street practically non existent then. like 10%. COVID IFR states 0.6% 0.7%, around 210K deaths roughly imply 30-35 million cases - 5 times reported. 

Still, hardly enough slow spread disease, except maybe hard-hit places like NYC 20% population affected. phase 1

n=191 reassuring dumb people everywhere, f-up country. That’s clinical trials exist, calm down. Vietnam war kill went there. Thoughts prayers whatnot Happy cake day! hope new path carving fucked meds. recalibrates maybe slowly try backtrack idiotic moves. time, sure capable. One thing done well paint line walk hard belief. possible. country ruled two political parties, capitalists leftists. capitalist anything keep economy (tourism necessary that), leftists anything keep borders open migrants refugees come in. political parties would anything else, simply party would enforce second lockdown. people would vote party keeps everything open. want continue normal life already so. That's infection rates skyrocketing. that's *nothing* compared see couple weeks Christmas. 300k limit, safety measures potential treatments.. make lie people stuff specifically. Yeah perspective individual certainly incentives wait (though knows long waiting). I'm situation myself, trying decide if/when second baby (and incidentally may living Singapore next year). country currently live fairly safe lived UK/US I'd second thoughts visiting hospitals etc. sure right place ask but..

Should self isolating?

My partners dad tested positive last saw (Thursday), outside whole time got tested anyway. Results came back negative us both.

I live UK guidance seems unclear. NHS website says stop negative test says get notification track trace app we've close contact someone tested positive need self isolate. got notification know app issues I'm surprised get notification.

I'm guessing probably isolate dont know ijt reailts negative? I’m saying everything untrue. I’m saying it’s quite badly written opinion piece. stuff factually incorrect, stuff taken context. It’s quite clearly written bias investigate. would one celebrate cause forced ancestors unwillingly betray United States? recall anyone dismissing CDC IFR report. recall lot people misrepresenting information within though. lot people argued 75 year old man 5% 10% chance death infected even though right IFR. ""appears safe"" means?

problem vaccines going injected 8 billion humans. ""appears safe"" enough, needs 99.9999999999999999999% safe. says WW1, many then? think almost over? thought lead. Pretty much. Although won’t able look cinders say “they need good forest management” “they raked forest floors”. actually state would handled much better. want Americans though Could people fucking dumber? getting information medical staff are, average, grossly obese? right wing media perpetuating it’s cold/flu coronaviruses cause colds/flus. ignore fact strain literally called SARS-COv-2 post locked. won’t able comment. wrong. China excellent job conquering Covid, need learn mad them. What's mortality rate? Something around 3 deaths per million? unfortunate. 

What get Christian leaders staunchly support Trump. see correlation Christ's character Trump's. looking way he's handled whole pandemic social issues past months evidence enough. He's devicive, selfish, liar list goes on. Christ said blessed peacemakers, care one another. like they're blind behavior claims pro-life. never considered might lying that, saying itching ears want hear? I'd say behavior anti-christ anything.

I feel bad anyone gets it, completely avoidable. blessing American days. actual fatality rate calculated - estimates, it’s hard calculate without true scope virus spread communities countries. wiping everything stopped said necessary 3 weeks ago. yet.... it...... ? direct quote somewhere? implications this? medical staffs general average grossly obese. deal that? I’d rather take risk negative side effects vaccine rather significant risk damage heart lungs brain covid. agree overall. still scary times see Trump stronghold though many areas. many people believe hung moon leaves office moon crash earth. vein mentioned, definitely many people walking away fight knowing guy doesn’t know throw real punch. really like psychology betting fight 7ft tall man vs 5ft tall man. Everything tells 7ft guy, refuse believe innately smaller guy win. finally get see real fights realize moves slow coordination etc, hold entrenched belief land one huge punch, slowly become numb watching 5ft man run circles around 7ft man. One one onlookers walk away knowing likely outcome don’t want watch. standby bet blame 7ft man loss cheating, given chance, etc. years fight sore losers continue believe 7ft man would win 100% “fair fight”. little archaic analogy, really fits well use new parts brain vs dinosaur parts brain. here. really well beginning, focussing work lot. right pandemic hit, really started getting social using opportunities like meetups socialize find friends.

Now new-found ways meeting others completely vanished start feel pretty lonely. still enjoy company trying make best it, crave socializing group, board games. pains actually friends invite this, practice social distancing meet groups people indoors, reject invitations crave most. drives insane.

Probably. really reasonable hope pristine process here. $50 month enough. major movies cost $200 million more, considering 2-3 people watch TV once, price around Mulan's. alcohol, flu, common cold.

UK reports food/dining fourth leading cause spread behind workplaces, schools nursing homes. 16 No. contrarian believes balance. agree you. important still recognize virus stop entirely. vaccine could likely annually (or often), still covid deaths.

So could 330k serious side effects yearly, plus another 330k deaf covid. variation. Break average deaths per year. article specific Idaho. Stop terrible person. Quick note contents: one common piece misinformation surrounding Covid big deal died, small percentage form comorbidity. consider article valuable gives us denominator equation. turns 45% Americans suffer least one major comorbidity. number rises 80% among elderly. 

This study rigorously peer-reviewed, take grain salt, feels like useful piece information hang to. self fulfilling prophecy. tell constituents lockdowns useless whilst implement lockdowns, lockdowns useless first publicly announced positive, there’s really way tell first afaik, everyone shows symptoms amount time may ask country from? lmfao Resturant precautions got backwards, putting tables 6 feet apart well, risk infection bigger people sitting table you. installing plexiglass shields middle table, stop everything better asking people mask bites. know supposed sit people households, also know people following regulations. sound like would expect American sound. Let’s find slightly less worse us opposed someone actually well. Ie sweden ""That's worked really well Wisconsin"" -Coronavirus  others die ? mask.

If everyone wore masks social distanced need shut anything down. Likewise buddy. it’s supports lot saying remember things differently. even make sense. opinionated argument.

Masks proven reduce severity virus. Less severe infections plus immunity almost vaccine works.

If everyone wore masks social distanced **we need shut anything down**. among comedians partying hanging indoor spots people United States died already coronavirus died influenza past five flu seasons combined.

Here's look numbers: The first person known died coronavirus United States died Feb. 29, according Johns Hopkins University. Seven months later, 210,000 Americans dead. Remember, “typical” flu season runs 7 months, October April.

According CDC estimates, many Americans died flu recent seasons:

2019-2020: 22,000 (preliminary)

2018-2019: 34,000 (preliminary)

2017-2018: 61,000 (preliminary)

2016-2017: 38,000

2015-2016: 23,000

2014-2015: 51,000

2013-2014: 38,000

2012-2013: 43,000

2011-2012: 12,000

2010-2011: 37,000

About 178,000 people died five flu seasons running 2015 2020, 210,000 people died coronavirus year. That’s fair. recent reports surges miscarriages still births, scientists still trying figure they’re caused covid infection secondary effects covid (stress, isolation etc). would much safer start planning families vaccine least. It’s always possible kids next year. last day December, Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued report confirming series rumors. report noted scientists studying unknown type ""viral pneumonia"" infected twenty-seven people associated seafood market. over-all message reassuring: “The investigation far found obvious human-to-human transmission, medical staff infection found.” 

There's absolutely nothing reassuring ""The investigation far found obvious"", whatever follows afterwards. clear ""carry information"" fact, Wuhan physicians already seen colleagues getting sick.

Yet confirmed infected new virus day report, ophthalmologist named Li Wenliang sent series warnings WeChat group former medical-school classmates. Somebody posted screenshots Li’s messages online, evening health officials summoned questioning. days later, police compelled Li sign confession warning constituted “illegal behavior.” 

Dr Li Wenliang reprimanded specific mistake claiming new outbreak confirmed SARS. illegal behavior spreading verifiably wrong information. live without restaurants months.

What's great restaurants? god’s chosen Obesity kills 300,000 Americans Spanish flu None that, see you’re trying take this, good one lunatic. Uhhhhhm. read this? uve read it, BS pandering real information here? I’ve read many “may ready 2020” articles one lifetime. Thank you! would need 981,000 deaths match death percentage. also people, better medication, better hygiene, dont anybody living trenches spread like wildfire in. fact even comparable countries like new Zealand barely affected embarrassing. also anti-viral drugs know better lower fever. antibiotics secondary infection. I'll agree still snake-oil salesmen today, like president, doctors better jumping baseless treatments. definitely helps knowing virus is.  many dead middle east since 2001? thought so. war decided matter, much simply fact. point, consider Martian, really matter true. Sure, longer considered citizens USA, fact, still were. said shut it, shit brains like white house. comedians staff entering given test didnt seem quarantine. tested virus, entered, none comedians wore masks. left chance comedian virus entering bubble yet detectable. I'm surprised honest. October 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed. Six months later, March 10, 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed. 346 people lost lives two incidents. Five days later, FAA determined design flaw aircraft used flights (737 MAX) cause accidents. flaw present 737 MAX airplanes world time.

With information mind, would flown 737 MAX airplane April 2019? Trump administration err removed airplane operation United States? Oh ok like education camp? think firing squad would better suited job? April 2920* Lol course bring strawmen it. said none things (except maybe believe deranged world), apparently happy Ben Shapiro pissing wind instead actually addressing points debate. never said ""fake"", did. never mentioned death toll (... neither you?). decided defend offhanded ""sociopaths"" comment ridiculous sources (I mean self-reporting survey mental health? Dude. I'm even going address obvious bait OMG.) I'm one going lengths, pointing logical inconsistencies. please continue sociopathy let know really feel. someone UK... yes. big deal month two. Load property damage. leader Opposition came denounced BLM (well, much allowed anyway) protests fizzled lot realized real political support. That's enemy within. 862,000 abortions US 2017..., still talking shitz kills us anyway. Secession treason. seceded British. Well chance get infected goes cases grow. cases grow exponentially environments precautions taken. socialized events play key part also fact americans covid today. likely general. Cast degenerates are. GOP worthless American people, shamed change ways. USA make Yeah makes sense. know. got shake head. Strange days. meant comments fun whatever way want label it, traitors United States (agree not). 

110,000 Americans killed actual patriots* would accurate, us explanation needed. 25male. Ive flu symptoms 2 weeks. basically leg weakness. breathing isnt efficient. sometimes chest gets little weird. Hard describe. breathing exercises get behind air inhaler. eat sleep alot hope ends soon. real good 5 days. Took walk. thr symptoms came back How? Impossible. look states protests bigger finding correlation that. Never said that. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ America known many military deaths.

Are still track 400,000 deaths end year? convenient stop showing deaths time. Ok. Sorry thought talking walked stairs balcony took mask Here's question. deaths equal? Seems like handling responsibly. sure issue here? breaking laws something? going reports scientists said 10X many cases reported?

Which isnt exactly going confirmed time soon.

It's speculation really it. gave last 50 coins — take em 😆😆😆 No, streamed 325,000,000 Americans, made point remove mask. true though nursing homes underfunded hard take quick action workers arent even qualified. 70% deaths nursing homes Lol one gets drafted first grade either. It’s really fucking dumb comparison. War kills young men, Covid kills mostly old people. comparison makes sense. alarming? huge increase work without underlying cause? thought Civil War scheduled Nov 3rd 2020. notheonion every bit counts. campaigns close too. time, many seeking volunteers phonebanks textbanks homes, even across state. went old historical documents Spanish flu area, seems recommending well ventilated areas! required transit always windows cracked open.

So basically we're 100 years ago. Jesus side would seem.  taken care himself, Jesus provided answer - wear fucking mask - didn't.  deemed illegitimate war? died (during war) wouldnt considered Americans, correct? way around actually end possibility October surprise domain white house? Needs must devil vomits kettle. think average age covid death is? Less 29?

Also, check numbers here: mad want different :(  city “except eating” mask order restaurants since June, I’ve said “Yeah, no” dine it. it’s dangerous wear mask it’s dangerous eat restaurant. Take-out over. LMFAO thanks laugh. I’m human I’m gonna fight preservation species. Humanity always comes first species me. you. positive influences life though? Yeah well, stimulus package you! Probably irrelevant. Flaunting restrictions cheered media, politicians, general public going severely undermine government's ability enforce restrictions. see new wave blender-based cuisine. Meals sipped straws. Yes, one party system exactly US needs.  looking retweet button shocked 🤦🏽‍♀️ like- yup! Gotta share insanity I'm remembering correctly, first wave Spanish Flu deadly. second wave came fall lot deadlier. recap accusations:

спокойной ночи tokyo govt message system

my untrained cat tests circus government thanks COVID, much less dying flu. Australia flu season year. Yet everyone wants live 🤔 fair viewpoint, know fair compare confederate soldiers even confederate citizen happened germany Nazis, southerners fighting preserve society grew thrived 100+ years, whereas Nazis woke one day laws rules explicitly outcastes entire race rights everyone else, every right gradually shipped away middle war. 

Also I'm trying defend southerner confederate, think nuanced. receive seek education know taught. could say it'd easy situation know what's right what's wrong completely different perspective. notion supremacy was, still is, deeply ingrained communities. Think easy find different opinions own, think many wilfully ignorant people live country today still choose hold infallible. Compare 150 years ago youd actively seek information disagreed everything told whole life, could face persecution seeking material disseminating it. 

Judge em want, they're dead, understanding makes easier converse try affect offspring may still influenced racist beliefs. evidence were. Yes vaccine thats actually nonsense. really make sure safe since people need ones already struggling health. doubt percentagewise... called **DECENT HUMAN BEING** I’m sure dozens countries dying another 20yr old degree communications video game addiction. Good luck lol Big corporations must taxed amount revenue received due closures small shops. cut COVID positive piece paper? Bye, bye, restaurants. guess depends define ""magic bullet."" idea people wear masks distance cut amount overall virus air cut overall transmission rate. practice found people wearing masks think dont distance anymore. worn less n95 since march really care, goes daily going stop spread. single time since march possible maintain 6 feet entire trip. yourself, doctors ok cloth surgical masks? CDC tell people cloth surgical masks dont protect wildfires? Wear mask, cloth mask respirator, matter much look similar. Let die many deaths? That's figure counts. Translation please. Yes, beginning people tested all. guys talk like thing see virus. world ecomony keeps spinning. Governments think too. understand many people /r/coronavirus insist get vaccine that's approved election. redditors. mostly kids, mostly super partisan, extremely smart.

A vaccine released week early long run takes week spread (not maybe, spring whatever). thing lose dipshit reddit types believe vaccine comes November 2nd, November 4th? That's probably good. screwed world, everything else domino effect. could pretty much ruin timeline. Iraq killing 3k americans retaliation fomenting nazi nationalism Im sure that, lots soldiers theyre sent war might die.

Sure unpleasant, end world imho. Actually could worse. context relate amount dead virus? Scotland. Currently allowed anyone visit homes. Usually bother much, work many others hospitality suffering people selfishly ignoring guidelines. Government threatening shut restaurants bars, meaning already struggling businesses let staff go even close completely.  dun goofed 99.95% American population alive well. rest thank China &amp; banned Hydroxychloroquine that’s used around world great success. True, major protests before, they'd still order would election prospects. Ok can't force people change. think people? Fuck fucking megacorps donated $5 her. much afford atm. can’t stand fucking evil turtle. corrected fatality rate. bad, again? small risk Trump got taken military hospital took whole concoction drugs fight - including antiviral drug still experimental stages.  Definitely odouls strength texas. People basically took one extra 3 day weekend started declaring victory lol smh. They’re still better rest world right now. ones dying fully functioning local economy. I’m sure work/what done?? California governor's office put tweet Saturday advising restaurant-goers keep masks dining. ""Going eat members household weekend?"" tweet reads. ""Don't forget keep mask bites. part keep around healthy."" nukes start flying nothing mater. gross simplification war. argue anymore. Can't fight mob. would hard \*more\* 14 days unless travelled forward time, right. numpty. Americans. citizenship remained valid look country's age stratified hospitalization rates. 

The notion huge percentage workforce going permanently debilitated absurd. Fuck yeah, fight good fight scientists! Must nice always someone else blame. CSA never formally recognized sovereign state. Union state world.

They insurrectionists rebels, Lincoln much still considered Americans. weapons, men, brothers again.”

That last word important sentence, implies Confederates opened fire began conflict renounced citizenship rights afforded them. Huh? I'm ""cherry picking"" anything, I'm pointing fact virus. okay sub virus lmao

It's funny people get mad facts like facts like. Point virus deadly pessimists think? pessimists get mad also people optimistic vaccine get mad (you). Next time take facts come. Yeah day ship gonna come they'd land slave live easy street. see point I'll take I'll feel bit safer seeing elderly relatives. ...let's forget Hillary put investigation fbi days election, also fucked Bernie over..  think influence well. Pretty sure White House’s official position is: nuh uh didn’t get Americans wanted human beings.  comparative understanding, many deaths per year US experience due Influenza? Hey hey now, maybe right Mason Dixon. West Virginia separated Virginia due slavery. Maryland divided. 

But right, people Americans whether like not. hate country... States rights! Yeah, states' right slaves! deflection tactic always kills me. currently states rights U.S. -- without slavery! relate. small portion S. Korea saying exact thing. mankind indeed brothers sisters! appropriate megathread others? Except fighting Americans. least, country therefore American currently used. mean? countries actually pretty transparent. Taiwan one better healthcare systems world. Vietnam took experiences SARS focused letting happen again. 

Taiwan caught wind covid new years eve within week started looking everyone Wuhan symptoms. [The Wikipedia page response loaded reputable cited sources really nice job breaking even hint national mourning. changed world 3300 dead 9/11. feel way too! moved city known festivals, events, restaurants shit ever since March pandemic. least dozen concerts lined year none concert organizers bought tickets refund tickets, reschedule dates. feel like I'm almost resigned live boring, country life. No, gives representation states. 

In popular vote scenario many states would simply matter.

As even small states make difference. 

Look population Iowa v.s. entire USA. many total seats electoral college. gives equal piece pie. don’t afraid though

/s Ronahouse bars Florida opened months went got food licenses. knew stakes.

I'm still baffled people pretend Confederate leadership know *exactly* doing. Omg... wonder many ppl gonna die black Friday year... oh man, lines year. Probably juat buncha stupid looting. makes sick. We're number 1! Man get resistance bands pushups those. think better analogy wars caused USA's meddling places be. excluding ww1 better point. wars, US policy put men wars business reasons often benefit us even people there. provides corollary coronavirus proper government action could've severely reduced effects.  american soldiers engaginn firefights Cold War? Dude even disease kills 0.1% there's vaccine planet that. cherry picking irrelevant information comment argue about. Hell go 0.01% vaccine kills level either. French Indian War might put top - 13.5K

But don’t know counts since U.S. wasn’t really country yet. That, doesn’t really sound PC anymore. I’m actually surprised haven’t changed name. 2nd third row guy, catch nice infections traveling bullet.  *literally* group...? They're ""Americans"" want anymore, got roped it. virus kills people healthy, like influenza. Hospitals cancel normal surgeries covid long time. pay bills ask? report many, deaths ""covid related"" like neighbors mom died car crash covid 3 months prior. Pull head fair crumbling decades
 
Covid managed get existing cracks can't ""squash"" something easily come right back. That's works. Right wrong, still countrymen treated such.

They literally said ""we're part country anymore fight me"".

This apologist bullshit would funny many Americans genuinely believe it.

Confederates traitors flag renounced citizenship restored grace mercy superiors getting shit kicked in. End story. guess it’s roid rage then. even matter. World annual flu deaths low end around 300,000 without, know, shut downs masks. Covid19 minimum one million worldwide less year shutdowns masks. 215k number likely couple hundred K look excess death numbers. bad flu guys..../s

Seriously, like 8 months one point expecting 60k deaths, seemed excessive time. Ok also makes sense. Thanks explaining. Basically comes whether Republican Senators really want help people stimulus bill. could go forth without Trump's negotiators, right - true balance powers? Natural selection Dumb clickbait comply, bet others won't. Help us. seeing, sadly, far greater suicides deaths Covid. We’re seeing far greater deaths drug overdose, excess, background, seeing deaths Covid.”

-CDC Director Robert Redfield article paper published lab, though involved analysis. age neurological complications younger age overall severe cases. ""Patients presenting neurologic manifestations younger without (57.53 [16.31] vs. 62.98 [18.97] years""

We 30-40 year olds study group fairly dramatically affected, clear recover cognitive deficit.  Thank obvious comments.  Bless you. Except people died ones wars didn’t catch first time through. I’m sure Nazi Nazi. know tank karma, 16 year old boy fighting country doesn’t know fuck. they’re rock hard place far conscription goes aren’t committing war crimes, evil people? are/were people shitty situations?

Edit: war pretty gross, lots unreal decisions made. higher flu novel. one immunity tolerance new virus. flu around forever people tolerant. Even so, flu still kills tens thousands people every year.

The thing viruses never go away. novel virus always going start really badly initial high death toll taper everyone gotten it.

We can't eradicate Covid-19 can't eradicate viruses, full stop. best thing build immunity, without vaccine way exposure.

No one downplaying tragic loss human life...it's matter best way deal novel virus, turns shutting everything done incredible damage millions millions people. Pence team agrees refuses agrees use plexiglass debate protect Harris.

At point flip flopping shows White House *just fucking us* - fucking libs media. Well good news ...no one died old age since March 85000 die every year flu? motivate others likewise. Apparently, involved minor way first years minor capacity escalated nearly decade later. always thought decade googled it.  see something deadlier world war.

Nothing deadlier war, except fucking Asteroid destroying planet.

Nothing else kill million people less second. America bad, Europe good, something adding up.  People US dumb comes vaccines. way put it. play theories vaccines nasty side effects. Side effects vaccines ultra rare. Even common (injection site irritation) rare. People US generally ignore though believe ""a story heard woman friend knows kid really messed vaccine!"" MMR great example. Suburban moms worried brain damage completely ignore actual side-effect measles brain damage fever gets high. happens way higher incidence side effect vaccine. bruh reddit But, unlike war, 346 COVID deaths US 15-24 year olds. old folks getting hammered. Thank owning apologizing. takes class rarity Reddit. Agree. like every country also deal outbreaks nursing homes. really can't blame deaths wars anyone else Americans America either started willingly went them. That's works. Nazis Germans, Confederates Americans. born 1842 south Dixie line, fighting right alongside them, like not, fighting idea America. must've missed news lately Throw D.C Puerto Rican statehood, permanently blue Senate. push gotten louder louder recent years. Democrats sweep house, Senate, presidency, Republican majority happen decade, barring enormous Democratic presidential scandal. seasonal flu....the fuck point trying make?

&amp;#x200B;

Old people die. 99.98% survival age 50. 40-50% Coronavirus deaths nursing homes.

Millions die globally TB Malaria even treatments, world still moves on. public figures/politicians getting covid downplaying it...they victims, akin drunk drivers. pity drunk drivers, dangerous people need held responsible damage cause lives ruined. Picture this, vulnerable age group 60, Trump doctrine states vote person mail bad, Trump doctrine also states mask wearing matter... possibility, even slightly, highly vulnerable group people going show event vote somebody encouraged something poses significant risk health, purpose voting man basically wants destroy future US democracy ? 
This science. possible would get honorable mention high school science fair colorful graphs.
For better examples, see: lol happening 0.01% death rate, bother? Uhhhh ""well 3,000"", 200,000. average deaths per days coronavirus multiple times higher combat deaths. Thank goodness don’t people working self interest like today. ..and dumbest one balcony think point, 1% extremely pessimistic. Like 20% American population estimated it. .2% population died it. I'm taking it. could care less choose stupid. isn’t said. said would complete need lockdowns, need mask guidelines. People need acknowledge way virus spreads, primarily mouth nose. airborne, people asymptomatic, never even know killed someone. No. never hit 80k 100% way going celebrate anything mid next year. Lol, China made great team last time... think angry? Lol  Trump said anything 1 2 million dead what? Like saying controversial right someone terminal cancer catches Covid, pushes edge.... Covid death.

And someone symptoms, tests positive Covid OD's drugs, dies.... Covid death.

Etc. Fuck hearing impaired, amirite? prompt calls millions immigrants serve upper class sounds like smart lady /s care honestly know. article I've read *says* why. 

If said ""Pfizer reached 4,000 participants mid-September, two months mid-November"" would clear right away. even that: counting participants people received doses? previous example, cited (hypothetically) late August. *first* dose, two months second dose would November.

So really depends got 3,000+. idea. long term Republican run usa kill country planet means long Amazon's stocks good short term 🙄😑😒 would know? white house refuses contact trace.

Besides, administration sharpied weather map got NOAA lie it. guy lied cloudy skies inauguration. claims ""they"" found ballot boxes ""the river"" refuses say where. chumps negative credibility. Assume anything say lie proven otherwise. Exactly lmao. Confederacy secession movement. countrymen, far countrymen get. Neither white house seems like he's gotten even crazy ever since got diagnosed covid. Must really affecting mind mean?  expect turd calls ""ToiletOfTheDamned"". Hahaha nice. UK get vaccine 50/highly vulnerable “Virtue signaling” ah, is. cause solely back school? Media owned old rich white people primarily conservative, course they're going focus hiding trump's obvious dementia sociopathy he's good ratings. wearing mask means communist ""If""? say ""...**because** America can't control coronavirus makes sense! Thank nuance. appreciate it. Tell called place schedule appointment one available 4 weeks.  Thank stat. mid-winter, sure CoViD-19 moved level two. Contact tracing, reason wife quarantine, effective social distancing alone. called back yet, seeing miraculous recovery? live Colorado Springs thought might local subreddit first saw it. guess must pretty bad outbreak. 8 million died flu since ww2 state secedes union, draw arms fight United States, enemy U.S. say born southerner confederate ancestry. knew stakes. Based God shut up. lol. empathize point. lives well, sacrifice much. no, it’s Applebee’s lmfao. I’m giving twenties grandma. don’t know she’s responsibility. reasonably. year it’s longer reasonable me. Stop virtue signaling pretending human beings anything are. Get it. cost controls health care start thanking COVID-19 victim's (who survived) service. come lies lose interest counting.

He'll carry lying that, course. able determine exact number. Okay, freak Someone said states eligible unemployment though believe areas act applying receiving could take while. Well UK get 50/highly vulnerable. ""There plague U A"" Covid 3rd leading cause death US year. 

Heart disease, cancer, Covid. 

10x people died diabetes covid.  Eh, Americans murdered words here. No, people run away infection sites stay away other, that's end. others never ended, better treatments like antibiotics. Viruses like herpes, polio, smallpox etc still going on. old days, people shunned lepers. Trump: literally get used looks comment thread tell we’re doomed properly quarantined, like countries, nearly painful. Unfortunately, current President care many people die, he's sociopath. instead letting medical science help guide us safe re-openings, politicized pandemic there's really safe way reopen now. either get vaccine, keep letting 500-1,000 people day die perpetuity.

At point, really going individual decisions figure do. I'm fortunate position go all, I'll continue that, keep others safe. others want that, that's them. vaccine come out, I'll look information made available multiple world governments (since data become part political fight), feel properly tested, I'll get it. bills he’s tweeting he’s ready sign send $1200 everybody right now! He’s place tonight. still considered fit lead? want MDs stop fucking disgusting use whole brain rather ""evidence-based"" part brain. saying trumps circle infected? Since when?

I noticed BBC website use day behind ever since cluster fuck backlog. Sun Tzu: watch enemies outplay lmao  bought railroad instead.  That’s Spanish fly means... data that? Second wave worst. Third wave least impactful I'm implying obesity might easier public health threat eliminate covid offends people Say goodbye grandma? USA! number 1!!! /s bring up? What's rationale? I'm saying wear masks anything like that. Right wife stuck home quarantine due close encounter someone CoViD-19. I'm saying fretting coming doctors see big increase hospitalizations. wife actually first person ever known close encounter CoViD-19 sick person. You’re selfish one expecting people give way life entirely live longer.

Are serious? ""way life"" puts others' lives danger height immoral selfishness. 

Read wrote apply climate change. willing change ""way life"" everyone around risk death, reason we're mess.

Jesus christ, r/selfawarewolves.  usually make sense Trump’s strategy (appealing base often method) one seems like bad move. lack trying extremists elements liberal party. ways Morrison's crabwalk towards dealing heath crisis impressive. never Found google search:

""While increases infant deformities skyrocketed around globe, tenacity FDA’s Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey prevented similar disaster occurring United States (only 17 cases reported). FDA never approved use thalidomide thanks Dr. Kelsey’s concern lack clinical trials, lack tests pregnant animals, insufficient reporting adverse effects William S. Merrell, American drug company. work led tightening FDA’s authority drug testing general. Comparing flu deaths COVID something ignorant person would do. beyond numbers close, flu deaths environment limited precautions taken. everyone kept lives going COVID like standard flu season fatality count would substantially higher don’t talk road accidents

We take precautions lower number traffic fatalities. Licensing, speed limits, rules road, seatbelts, airbags. understand parralel pandemic? Perhaps wise take similar precautions like masks social bothered virus long gone even dangerous seasonal flu.

Yeah, that's still lie. become true simply Trump repeated it. far ""long gone"", still coursing fucking White House, mention rest nation. killed three times much worst year flu 7 months. Two months safe observed data needs submitted approve it. think sample size needs 200,000 Really? would going classes. Honestly, probably would stop attending gym rules like that.

When working breathing heavier, studies shown produce higher viral loads. Combine enclosed space, recipe COVID transmission.

If outside small number people distance Ill take mask off. inside people wearing mask. Full stop, exceptions. wow thats V shaped recovery daily cases older sister got 13, sister 6 years younger got 10. make wonder made difference there. current administration: ""All lives equally worthless"" causes death kill cancer heart disease. medicine contagious. I've worked country's epidemiology department. record want review case either confirm deny it. think people “fortnight” follow guidelines contributed statistics, people don’t really mind throwing everyone else bus? That's whoopsie wonder actually happened  Sweden problems? huge spikes deaths Florida? traitors  I’ve read Articles Confederation. never mentioned this.

It slavery bullshit thrown make seems like wasn’t slavery. 

But clear, slavery. mentality almost exclusively LEAD civil war first place.

Hmm, let's check:

""Our position thoroughly identified institution slavery""

from *A Declaration Immediate Causes Induce Justify Secession State Mississippi Federal Union.* 

Also:

""Those States assume right deciding upon propriety domestic institutions; denied rights property established fifteen States recognized Constitution; denounced sinful institution slavery""

from *Declaration Immediate Causes Induce Justify Secession South Carolina Federal Union*

Nope, slavery.

They traitors handle concept able another human property treated such. that, knew back February. remember first cases started appearing US. looked early data showed mortality rate higher spreads faster flu. obvious combination two would make much worse flu. even many medical professional time underestimating impact this. make sense based numbers.

Most medical professionals changed minds pretty quickly saw influx patients pouring hospital. Unfortunately, lot people first-hand exposure caring COVID patients. keep thinking nothing flu someone know dies it. People bright South Dakota...? Americans fucking disgusting, want? faded limelight? seemed like heard much since 2016 every four years flu too, vaccines available. Context key, people. true, CDC numbers U.S war death numbers well kept track of. bought us reusable masks N95 filter inserts. wash reusable part thoroughly change filter every 2-3 times wear them. also regular N95 masks backups case. asked powerful shadowy cabal shit master plans once. could see entire logic structure shudder second reality intruded, Logic Override kicked something something Grand Unknowable Plan plucky CEOs right sort billionaire underdogs fighting us, etc. says right article asthma. One day it'll go away Probably place share financials one wanted hear tbh... [I’d say that’s anecdotal notion given Ah, miss remembered. said millions cases.  actually stated death count, looks it. 50%, like 35%--the Trump base. get all-expense-paid (by taxpayer) trips hospitals oriental carpets probably tanning beds soon, too! try plexiglass install theater science purpose problem died car accident 2020 we’re tested positive Covid, likely labeled Covid death. yeah, it’s even close everyone virtually died Covid year. genuinely believe people lied tricked telling lied tricked somehow better people tricked better were, they're ones help them.

What telling superior want help also superior.

Where's compassion?

Now, see argument helping actively denying help themselves, that's little different. Same. think people want certainty things going be. I'm Wisconsin awful partisanship. page 550 says even worse karma hope someone who's got blood hundred thousands people hands live long prosper life.

A lot leaders blood hands pandemic, many blood hands due flu season diseases too. leaders, opinion, deserve live long prosperous life?

EDIT: I'm getting downvoted asking question? don’t blame them. Nothing. airborne. Distance size venue matter more. Florida world own. know people whose last words ""Fake virus"" math clue restaurants spread places following rules, you? numbers pretty stable last weeks. Let's see recent changes affect growth rate go ruining peoples lives. Bad apples need closed are. Ford handled correctly again. never happen republicans also control state legislature. well truly screwed Michigan soon one worst states covid 19 wise. democratic governor clawed us back brink GOP opposition way given power brethren SSC fucked put mildly. really, yesterday report something similar happening Pzifer Moderna vaccines action taken FDA went ER Canada none staff seen wearing N95 masks. shitty surgical masks... really good source control maybe reducing viral load.  I'm sad say something would surprise him. It’s difficult traitor country, like, country intend represent policy direction? mean, cancer rates going up, increase life expectancy, since one longer increasing, live polluted filth, kindly sponsored corporate overlords. mandatory WEAR mask outside middle nowhere.
Starting today mandatory mask everytime leave home.

Masks already mandatory closed areas like shops. Outside wear mask could enforce social distancing even before. “works” (eating meat) **doesn’t** work everyone else (aka rest world put pandemics issues like global warming environmental devastation you’ve helping create). Doesn’t work one animals either. fair, that's pretty much War Drugs works. backed terms empirical social outcomes, U.S. et al cow every country submission it. Far impossible. mummy? true, get pasture raised chickens allowed outdoor time every day certain amount square feet roam. Yes still compassionate thing do. responsible someone else's life decisions behavior affect behavior. idea they'll impacted. Boris Johnson got covid came greater understanding impact disease. also hired personal trainer goal losing weight. Clearly infected positive impact him. Trump got infected telling people worry covid flu worse covid is. Clearly impacted negative way exact event. know impact decision show compassion person. kind know lack compassion though. might even know got it. might feel like got cold. might develop fever gasp air hours day. might die. impossible say, best bet never take chances.

For plenty first hand reports people who've suffering months, check r/covidlonghaulers Anything else care mansplain Mr. McDuck? like certain packages food keep staying price years quantity keeps getting less less.

Pretty sure must backlash people complaining prices understanding inflation unit cost. Thanks fact check, can't remember read four times (maybe portion US something rather overall average remembered wrong?). Double look accurate. Edited. 100% referring Tulsa Doom bc honestly can't use real name without feeling dirty. 65,000 Miami Dolphins fans would actually show game? wonder assume people realize he's alive pander base Twitter. muddling bunch things single argument. HIV determined origins bush meat trade simian immunodeficiency virus. Mad cow prion disease (like scrapies sheep) spread via using animal nerve tissue animal feed. Ebola spread via blood contamination suspected roots bush meat. 

Respiratory viruses like H1N1 roots animal-animal animal-human cross-species transmission. Major issues farms people live work close proximity animals, animals kept close proximity other, exported/imported checks. night cinema. Nope, economic crash will!...and covid convenient excuse corrupt politicians nothing past three decades tp stop it... Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes.Five hundred twenty five thousand moments dear.Two hundred eleven thousand US lives cost.All politicians want sell fear.

How about, love?Put mask stay home. can't something public welfare infringes liberties, stop using roads paid for. Stop using school systems paid for. Stop taking social security disproportionately contributed to. Stop accepting public help whatsoever, yourself, longer American. independent nation take care yourself.

A bunch selfish asshats can't embrace distance education inconvenient, can't accomplish basic income moment national crises political bickering. Thus requiring people put harms way largest economy planet, absolute worst outcomes planet, survive.

This year incredibly shameful entitlement self interest.

This woman dead. gone. kids never see again. students never learn again. economy lose wages spending goods. 5 children left traumatized life, go bar, getting infected sending kids 'free daycare' opted in-person schooling getting teacher sick. perhaps 'had pumpkin spice latte' got infected, decided go store stand line behind woman getting groceries. gets infected dies.

Stop taking un-necessary risks deal mental health crises. Humans required close proximity survive, choose so, vast majority interactions, entertainment. get it. I'm people power lie things camp. Republican/Democrat stuff rough right now.  dont trust them. Imagine stupid...so FUCKING STUPID, think entire planet faking virus politics. Yeah can't tax richest besides everything said find way around it. solution empower masses. bar low us. Nobody living poverty. told strategy back march, seems like must paying attention, successfully brainwashed, equally probable this? Legitimately speaking. absolutely enraged want things change previously cancer running one kidney type 2 diabetic. I’m sad families loss want point point pretty much determined makes people fall ill I’m confused people don’t talk bring up. need laughs nowadays. I’m home likely COVID least next three days await test results. Haven’t heard, it’s patriotic get give COVID-19? True warriors unnecessarily risk lives willing infect others. Yeah, people 100% **not** kind skeptics want. 

I even call skeptics all. Arbitrarily questioning everything critical thinking skepticism. person incapable empathy, may never learn. Antibody studies showed nearly 30% NYC covid point already, August. went March April way little testing, even majority people asymptomatic never get tested.

The number deaths also bit undercounted, errors side equation too.

The epidemiologists CDC done hard math us corrections, came IFR (infection fatality rate) 0.65%. estimates 0.5 1.0% well.

Worst case scenario 1.0%, 2.5% best case scenario. Given know, every single person US gets it, 2.5 million people would die, 10 million.

That's really really bad, need keep happening, obviously. there's reason lie numbers. comment needs top.

Another thing bothers rhetoric paints picture people deliberately profiting pandemic. happens businesses run/own happened well positioned new normal. Also worth noting appreciation value assets pocketing check $100B.

All Amazon shareholders (anyone buy amazon stock) held shares period would earned return. 

I don’t know certain I’d imagine least wealthy people lost bunch money way year. def blow-ups hedge funds.

No doubt wealth inequality issue needs addressed tone articles like obviously sensationalist Ikr?! \#freeclaudia  stupid. Clearly meant pacific time /s Well California fine. Florida opens bars major spike. rapture bodies streets hospitals overrun patients Imagine terrible innovation would become people willingly give control company share worth $1 billon mask shortages. excuse hide fact person, company, negligent. 


Even hospital providing new masks, Nurse could easily afforded own, washed own, asked help. literally excuse think conscious adult capable changing mask. Well magical sky man might help PRAYS him! Yes, understand well believe it’s hypocritical way see things. vegetarian thinks need animal products order get protein doesn’t really understand nutrition mindset meat eaters have. vegetarian doesn’t understand great harms egg dairy industries also mindset meat eaters. told what’s stupid remarks, I’m ready take rebuttal. right, way replace food taking small steps. everyone could afford replaced one meat per month, would enormous demand alternatives. trick convincing people engage behavior, political thing comment context. Ah yes. video yelling people get beach! better NZ? #170? Ah, Big Book Genies, Gods Fairytales, page 549, it?

Well, page 550 says even worse karma hope someone who's got blood hundred thousands people hands live long prosper life.  know that, yeah help hear. Thank think meat prices like 34% average due plague, nobody trying harder stop virus. seems like would absolutely let meat prices go up. Hard believe two decades 21st century people think ""believing"" virus determines whether get sick not... Prestige tax. Want prestigious career? Chances money made lost became prestigious. [Sure come bat, check article **2015** regarding  global revolution open source. nearly dying permanent disabilities

lol flat earther thinks Australia myth start.

Or Canadian complimented Scottish colleague ability speak English.

Or guy thought made Uzbekistan sound real. That's gotta next level stupidity. Watch Orange County. K-12 opened late September. Students wearing masks. observe virus wild. I've read could probably find infected looking viral genome Person person believe required take refugees UN Charter. Doctors probably wondering stupid acting due hypoxia Yeah thats happening. Factory farming going get intense start making vertical. ""noooooo, dare follow along blindly trust international ministry truth!"" Florida thing I've ever heard Yeah, I’m pretty sure remember reading Greek philosophers like Plato knew Earth round. talking me? humanity whole? 

Personally advocate factory farming. Regarding macrosocietal purposes however, think factory farming necessary evil. palatability beans lentils nowhere near satisfying hungry belly warm slab meat.

If Donner party beans lentils... fools.

If argument everyone vegetarian, argument 99% people sterilized birth. population sustainable vegetarianism popular answer towards sustainability. true young children flu indeed deadlier? never stated opinion one way other, said follows timeline Herman Cain he'll die election Day. Personally want die, think that's easy way out. American worked fast food solid 2 years. 

So patronize me. people tout declaration exact thing accusing others doing. scientific study. opinion piece supported scientists doctors. may right, scientists doctors think wrong. signed 5,000 doctors across world impressive consider nearly million licensed physicians United States alone.

I basic practical issues proposal would need addressed anything suggest implemented. believe end 2021 least. honest question, seen evidence outbreaks due gyms? People keep saying perfect place virus, every gym around requires masks 24/7 think source major transmission this. Lol look u.s. decision makers meet team believes convinced much public attorneys front time (contingency) costs/expenses represent average joe worker bad guys. They’ll get vaccinated early helps Yeah, hyperbole comment. know that, problem inmense amount stupid people Would love see photoshoping Trump Ramsey Bolton telling Theon (Christie) name Reek. Perfect description lot Republicans right honestly. one hand, idiot thinking there's coronavirus... other, governments really done shit job explaining people is, done shit job reacting all, still shit job many regards. part understand there's many people believe it, even stupid hell. Wash hands! example, young adults COVID-19, including athletes, also suffer myocarditis. Severe heart damage occurred young, healthy people, rare.

Clearly, need stay inside. like, forever.  Death Cult! worked government know once? 

Try come ridiculous theory try make people something see see it. 

Maybe worked wrong department. /S. crazy think WWI WWII rich people US let kids go war (and die many instances), notable rich men went Titanic 1912 allow women children live. 

Fast forward 2020 scenarios largely unheard states. Look Trump behaved Walter Reed-- needlessly exposing people Covid allowing patients adversely affected presence.

We shocked Trump called people sacrifice lives ""losers"" ""suckers"". called Christianity ""scam"" ""they're hustlers"". contend base care prevailing conservative culture self fulfillment instead serving others. understand Republicans get poor people unite ultra-wealthy really give shit anyone-- guess selfishness common. varies subreddit. subreddit COVID-19, China relatively successful response to. result, surprising discussions China positive. mention portion (though all) negative Chinese sentiment conspiracy drivel (e.g., ""CCP hiding millions cases / deaths!"")

But subreddits (like r/worldnews, r/geopolitics), sentiment much anti-China.  Like said, anything save skin. 

Including letting people whatever want political reasons, even throws whole country bigger mess. anything like town live I'm surprised. poorer end town mill around mix like covid exist. thought moving path..have right next whoever walking with..side side...and school run. stand together talking huddle blocking way.
The area live far considerate social distancing rules far closer adhered to. 
Why? know..you social distance well choose whether well poor..or middle. There's lot analysis involved business. Maybe that? long branch managers franchisees know make pizza run single restaurant, need know much that. zoomed-out level sales, purchases, personnel, etc. variables analyzed improved. Anybody got details happening UK? looked stats there's massive new case spike Oct 4th 23,000 cases.  Many models criticized wrong worst case scenarios never eventuated simply protective measure like social distancing actually took place.

It's frustrating hear people saying ""see wrong"". necessarily wrong, media, especially, reports worst case nothing scenarios ignores best better case scenarios measures taken. live Isreal. make money fans, players (non-quarterbacks anyway). actually incentive protect them.  us work medical field call them; big boy beds! Miami vs Tampa nobody wins. MILAN (Reuters) - Italy make testing COVID-19 compulsory people traveling United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium Czech Republic, Health Minister Roberto Speranza said Wednesday, following growing concerns rising cases across Europe.

“Infection data growing across Europe Italy too”, Speranza wrote Facebook.

“I’ve signed order makes coronavirus testing compulsory travellers Belgium, Netherlands, United Kingdom Czech Republic”, said. hasn’t family requested account deactivated? hospitals tell sellers good Ppe. Seems like overly broad assessment. current practices certain issues mean safer/more efficient way effectively.

Curious though, someone clarify points 4 5 related industrial factory farms? scale factory farms ship live animals around globally? really participate animal fairs, auctions, live animal markets? markets seem like opposite end spectrum locals smaller farms congregating local buyers/consumers.

&amp;#x200B;

""industrial animal farming caused new infectious diseases humans past decade"", wish article list new infectious diseases. 

Covid-19 \*possibly\* got started market, 1918 flu bit nebulous point initial vector even location, ebola spillover events rural non-livestock related. Mad-cow, hoof-and-mouth, bird flu, swine flu seem facilitated dense livestock and/or bad practices. Others? Nope. know significantly less people dying every day live. Sweden different society different societal norms. troll cannot bothered with. Jersey. surprised. Tell grandchildren that, see them, spendables ACCEPT DEATH can't keep using excuse though. countries, including democratic ones, managed fine. Australia fine. New Zealand fine. Singapore fine. Malaysia fine. Democracies, Singapore closest technocracy China's. surprise since China learned lot Singapore.

Even Canada relatively fine, bordering country poster boy pandemic failure. Nah. Twitter probably archive it. epidemiologists handling things differently Swedes. already know. Canada doesn’t either. course. us know virus real. 
The problem half people believe word man says, spoken one word truth last 10 years, take plague threats seriously. half actually believe lies, think we're handling whole thing rather well. we're really not. Well, lies people, causing trust die.

Not intentionally killing, nothing prevent, certainly things cause. Might intentional? IDK. seem great anyhow. think movie schedule year see theaters. mind someone go yeah, pretty bland.  get *logic.* want know *evidence* actually that. utter nonsense talk herd immunity infection confer immunity. Coronaviruses interfere germinal center interactions reduce/prevent memory cell formation. Telling since mid-March, hopefully clear people next year stop talking herd immunity nonsense. 1000s authors agree it, make fiction? Remember Tay? Microsoft AI became white supremacist exposed internet like 24 hours? totally envision Trump AI running Twitter probably even able tell difference both. I've literally never heard argument pandemic. always animal cruelty.

Also, pandemic ever started factory farming? seem start shithole china people live filthy conditions close animals. now, eat ton meat doesnt automatically mean joke. sauces?  people United States died already coronavirus died influenza past five flu seasons combined.

Here's look numbers: The first person known died coronavirus United States died Feb. 29, according Johns Hopkins University. Seven months later, 210,000 Americans dead. Remember, “typical” flu season runs 7 months, October April.

According CDC estimates, many Americans died flu recent seasons:

2019-2020: 22,000 (preliminary)

2018-2019: 34,000 (preliminary)

2017-2018: 61,000 (preliminary)

2016-2017: 38,000

2015-2016: 23,000

2014-2015: 51,000

2013-2014: 38,000

2012-2013: 43,000

2011-2012: 12,000

2010-2011: 37,000

About 178,000 people died five flu seasons running 2015 2020, 210,000 people died coronavirus year. Claudia does.

\#freeclaudia rich republican social circles. Also plane passengers. peer reviewed official unfortunately. Even people won’t listen. 

I don’t know want start lower dose get infected. That’s good enough reason wear one. Thank you, much appreciate that. &lt;3 Surely dumb, since he's engineer

no, dumb. single axis. there's critical thinking, memory, problem solving, ability admit faults, ego, etc. man gullible dumbass. profits go research, improving buildings, expansion service areas, etc. Without profit, would employees ever see cost living increases? would hospitals stock PPE? would put new coat paint older rooms? Every business needs operate profit fails. Florida drift past 15000 though, still racking numbers decent lick\*.

 \* People Florida, please go around licking things. Without Trump help would minimal Suicides terrible thing social interaction important. But, cherry picking one part comment. Large gatherings like sporting events way social interactions (I would argue good real social interaction, own).

People get together friends. social interaction. distance masks may change slightly, definitely zero.

It's frustrating people keep straw man distance masks equal hard/full lockdown. even close. Wearing masks public/closed spaces social distance appropriate much closer fully open lockdown. found sane person sub. Avengers Endgame high water mark theater industry. many theaters closing, know we'll ever get global theater spending event like many years twice Houston neither one ever utilized. Covid ICU hospitalizations got 35-37% range total ICUs dropped mask mandate implemented. eat plants US also happens one president talking americans, sure. friendly reminder, Mitch McConnell spent months holding stimulus force provision makes gross negligence legal. disinformation Ahahahahahahahahahahahahah long rich stay rich. agree this. pork Nancy wanted add ridiculous.  saw that....as WI resident, say...I like club. (and everytime drive downtown, feel bloodpressure rise little seeing 20 somethings barhopping without masks like goddamn joke). 1. Humans omnivores. remove factory farming, still plants grew eat.

2. Factory farming calorie inefficient. Technically, stopped would *more* food, less. Beef 20/1 calorie ratio (chicken pork 2/1). say technically people pick giant bag ""Corn Sorghum Meal"" Walmart, cropland still viable foods.

3. We're talking ""MEAT MURDER!"" PETA dystopia meat products banned overnight. logistic restructuring scale factory farming, scale *up* free range farming, prices shifting time people adjusting habits. already saw bit COVID meat shortages start. People starve streets, ate something else. uncomfortable, mostly weird rolling shortages. think people misunderstanding you’re trying say... also result eating tons fast food. [trump oval Seems like issue states failing report recoveries. numbers helpful states report recovery numbers. Obviously, half states cases happened last couple weeks, especially cases falling states last weeks. Makes sense stop think it. That's enough make call Benyamin. It’s legal PPE. Idk tell you, hospital administrator sends “N95” masks aren’t standard sued. Like hospital knew thousands non functioning masks. It’s easy sit back say “they need better” don’t hear rational reason can. Pretty selfish response. you, limiting spread. spreads likely someone going die gets it. Doesn’t matter. thing matters covid lmao Well used to... see take president* bul****t asked sometimes even pay Big plexiglass making fortune know. barriers we've installed work hilarious. wide open rooms 6'x3' plexiglass dividers people walking around day long lol Picture shows many wearing masks, social distancing. *two hospital beds* smart thing

You're epidemiologist now? one cares never herd guy is.. know trump.. hes great, dudes nothing. Sad state affairs alright. original title: Coronavirus Killed Americans Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan World War Combined

I wanted hijack top post say, thanks Obama. looks like phentermine prescribed specifically short term weight loss efforts, side effects look pretty rough. Vyvanse approved specifically binge eating disorder generally well-tolerated long term use. probably long term weight loss Vyvanse (I lost 10 lbs weeks, put back within couple months), could help binging. know problems tolerating phentermine would carry Vyvanse though. mean though. point lockdowns buy time learn works. We've done treat patients better good guidelines people follow.   Even don’t die, children virus ending lung heart damage. It’s causing Kawasaki syndrome one children.

Just live doesn’t mean won’t lasting health issues rest life. Bring immunity death. Living prayer? don’t think it’s good plants either? meat way inefficient produce plants plants end eaten overall Smh, I’ve read article. explaining Americans way, întarzîa! Yep, aren’t NY, MA, NJ, CT, Louisiana RI way higher per pop? (I’m RI; it’s bad here.) Great, thanks much! knowledge imbue thread? Oh mistaken. scientist spoken (copy pasted DM)

""I work heavily autoimmune space work lots disease indications skin result control inflammation innate immune cells ones disease specific. work projects trying limit severity things like psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, fibrosis, systemic sclerosis like.

Lmao could possibly go wrong? low percentage (whom I'm assume referring to) can't lose weight horrible chemical imbalances within body.

I know couple people hundreds doctors visits tests, they're incredibly embarrassed stressed weight. assume person responded either struggles knows somebody does. 

We lot things make fun Chris far worse weight. 

Also, dont feel ounce sorrow whatever happens Chris, made bed. Oh 100% agree that's banana pancakes.

My issue said ""masks necessary""

Then says ""masks super important""

When asked, learn something new change mind said ""no, want public buying PPE health care workers would need.""

Whether he's right, gave authority make decision unilaterally lie American people especially elected! like put hospital try piggyback Trump's hospitalization something...like patriotic something. Yeah, take care workers well. buy yachts work multiple jobs survive. worse hospital, could 2 months longer.

wow gonna need hospital bill forebearance next mean I’m worried virus kills fewer people age driving Amazing job. elimination strategy pay long run. occasionally eat meat well. However, feel like notion eating meat completely harmless everyone animal slaughtered satiate appetite quite misguided. meat industry causes great deal harm environment actively contributing climate change. really, one's decision eat meat affecting single person's health, legitimately affect health others. Moreover, article discussing, industry caused outbreak many infectious diseases. So, again, health affected. like 20% survival rate ventilator?

One NYC hospital system reported 20% survival rate someone went vent. Note pretty early crisis NYC, venting people quickly. Now, they've found better ways support patients need oxygen (proning, CPAP) better medications (dexamethasone).  right, think Americans cowardly able lock properly issues declaration. many ways seem based reality makes number assumptions.

The heart proposal, call Focused Protection, essentially two categories people, vulnerable vulnerable people. Vulnerable people presumably include elderly preexisting conditions including diabetes obesity. vulnerable people include everybody else, special emphasis young people. make claim protecting vulnerable population letting vulnerable population resume normal life allow us develop heard immunity quickly reduce social harms lockdown.

My main issue assume vulnerable vulnerable people easily separated. people vulnerable category live isolation. Many elderly people live nursing homes multi-generational households. around 64 million multi-generational households United States. difficult protect elderly person multi-generational household rest household resumes normal life. single member household easily infect others quickly, course would put elderly people living house danger. mention short declaration comprehensive detailed list measures, including approaches multi-generational households, implemented, well within scope capability public health professionals. 

This implies comprehensive detailed list measures completed simply assumes list even possible. 

In mind automatically creates three categories people, two. vulnerable population, vulnerable population regular contact members vulnerable population, vulnerable population regular contact members vulnerable population. goal reduce mortality, seems group would able resume normal life would last one.

This declaration also seems focus death ignoring many side effects disease. true large segments population get seriously ill die COVID-19, side effects worth considering, including side effects still well understood, including potential neurological damage loss taste smell. 2021: “don’t tempt me.”  never said anything believed came from, laughed believe ""almost certain"". proof go along that? know US nationalize health care system time. would saved lives lot young doctors. column official github data. New infections. That's number whole world uses counting.  seems like japanese setting, choice wear mask scenarios. left leaning people post seemingly negative news would happy vaccine wasn’t another 16 years Nothing see here. Move along. kind vegetarian relies heavily animal products get “protein”, may even worse meat eater eats less animal products overall - really bad.

Just stop. look whole pandemic, weekly roundup. article LITERALLY says nothing specifically nothing precautions need taken. 

Or gate I’m getting past? leads even less credence particular authors view despite mentioning fauci. Testing tracing effective reducing risk; read article NFL outbreaks sub - reason NFL badly Covid compared sports leagues implementing tracing/testing without mask/social distancing mandates. Sounds like entitled prick probably sexually harassed female staff.

A Trumpanzee, words. Maybe immune like president ! Cool! Seems like message would powerful Trump came mic. know anyone thinks getting 100% honest take anyone left right. even close accurate he's entire beaches himself. Wonder really had? Meanwhile Netherlands prime virologist advising government still says masks unnecessary  beginning data confusing emergency would underline increase CURRENT cases TOTAL cases.

Since months make clear count column new cases. That's 3600 today. Media adapted everyone uses increase total cases.

The number difference active cases compared yesterday (new cases today - deaths today - recovered today). Well schools big issue cases gone covid since august I'm saying nobody idea China controlling COVID jailed doctors, journalists lawyers.
They also locked people homes used military prevent movement. We've flu years know make good estimation models. Corona brand new.. Also, flu deaths would show symptoms covid would count ""probable.""

Here's another one, June, Washington counting homicides covid deaths sure states.  Unfortunately, whether right wrong, US citizenry multi century history wanting told do. kind thing.

Not wearing mask okay. dangerous rude disrespectful makes people look like shelfish idiots. me, learned easy way: listening scientists need roll large scale testing kids “high risk” areas. least one school positive test need test entire school. going explode covid numbers, especially winter time coming up.

I hate people like this. They're making problem worse causing extremism. happened reason? CARES Act gives hospitals 20% Medicare patients diagnosed COVID. percentage patients COVID investigations abuse system.  might look article, seems suspicious friends number local stations debunked narrative-- find one area. Also, COVID deniers want think commorbidities ""erase"" people got COVID accelerated death. 

But two things think about:

\--That 20% extra given patients way makes costs retrofitting hospitals, setting testing system, buying enormous quantities #PPE disgracefully unregulated market paying extra medial staff (traveling nurses, MDS, etc,) well cleaning public transportation, etc.

\-- current WH denied BILLIONS funding New York State Trump wants punish Cuomo NY following narrative COVID.

Socrates actually told once, ""smoke another blunt bro"" doubt user would pick leader third world country like US

EDIT: Let explain.

They're trapped eternal rat race. They're basically robbed edcational system choice stuck whatever work environment help get rid debts - whole lot show for.

They get barely vacation time (here legal minimum 25 paid days), proper parental leave (in Germany, three years), proper health insurance (what medical bill look like..? know), forgot old age: people who's job greet everyone Walmart entrances they're old, barely stand upright anymore. Always nearly made tear can't even imagine mom still work late 60s mid-70s.

Most Americans, understand, even able save money. What's earned spent right away bunch shitty food cheap plastic house car. They're also forced accumulate debt order get credit, highly bizarre.

The thing is, even realize bad FEEL like hey're living paradise: (theoretically) buy everything want buy, shelves always fully stocked (with fuck ton crap that's ridiculously bad health talk food, fuck ton crap that's shipped China talk useless stuff), countless programs tv. abundance crap one really needs keeps state semi-sedation life long.

If take convenience consumption aspects away them, they'd suddenly realize there's much quality living left.

You know, early afternoon village, look outside right now, see peope riding bikes jogging walking dogs pushing strollers little children coming home school little bicycles; see grannies riding bike local store...

When living US, town DEAD. thing alive stinky fast food places, people ""fuck enivronment"" gas-guzzlers queuing early morning late night. that, hopped car straight living room, drove work, drove go shop crap, went straight back living room again. Idk man. made sad watch. you’re making stuff up. don’t think anything Trump. I’m looking vaccine developed companies made flu vaccine took, it’s approved FDA. politics play? definitely. materially affect safety vaccine? No. 

What think actually happening? thousands people dying (or adverse side effects) clinical trials, Trump secretly hiding results pushing approval? also think moon landing faked?

Come on, stop hysteria. say “hey, think political pressure going on, I’m bit wary taking vaccine personally” hysterical say it’s “dangerous” one take is, well, hysterical anti-vaxxer mentality.

PS: Like mentioned before, FDA released guidance, circumventing WH guidance linked above. Also, people need keep mind squabbles things like “we think approval data R squared 0.91 instead 0.92” granular things. It’s “push vaccine through, matter dangerous is” hysterical people seem think. acted irresponsibly going studio.

Shame them. Hey, hey, hey... let's keep clean -- may kids forum. reason start talking tits.... realize 'Fauci lying' Trump talking point? science, change view new information presented. covid, thought masks helped others medical grad (like n95 masks) protected wearer. That's said waste masks expose healthcare workers. evidence became available wearer also protected even two ply cloth masks provide protection. 

But he's saint course. 20th century, Europe higher excess mortality rates 1939-1945. 50’s much lower. 

Of course segment different time periods. Unless idlot. don’t think are. [Me prediction: Thousands lives going risked admire greatly. He’s trying best he’s trying save people. Assuming anything Chinese actually standard pretty large assumption though. could got mask.... would seen already. know lot vegans chronic illness, got better adopting vegan diet. There’s virtually nothing (no macro micronutrient) get animal products can’t get vegan diet + vegan supplements. there’s plenty harmful stuff comes animal products can’t eliminate.
This personal excuse think somehow makes eating animal products acceptable.

How fucking empathy animals breeded, exploited sent death behalf (plus human lives affected irresponsible choices)?  Error. fall deaf ears. Due non-adherence mask-wearing social distancing guidelines, citizens registered GOP risk getting transmitting virus.

Anyone wants debate whether restrictive measures remain needs first willing answer question: many deaths acceptable? Yes, obviously society willing say 60-100k deaths/yr acceptable (for flu). So...is 200k/yr acceptable? 400k/yr? 1m/yr? mental loop responsible much common ideologically bound groups focus ""us vs. them"". works like this;

* *Since [people] know answer, maybe nobody does, answer one I'm already convinced true [since obviously true].* met six people survived car crashes, would assume people die car crashes?

Six good start, results even six people --- let alone six monkeys--- enough prove anything anyone. Six small number.

The thing test proved vaccine promising enough worth money try humans see happened. That's important step process, I'm knocking it. veeeeeeeery early step prove much. understand reluctant participate.

But point stop giving people pass choosing uninformed critical issues facing society. don’t know modern vaccine studies work weary them, look make informed decision. would genuinely respect someone research decided wasn’t simply weren’t comfortable it.

I don’t respect people commit participate without looking all. can't help FDA speed investigation like elsewhere trials resumed? Thinking country could incredibly naive. Decades propaganda defunding education made millions Americans vote interest. tiniest bit research, you’ll quickly discover masks recommended, well-known within scientific community effectiveness masks *at best* unproven. case *decades.* want virtue signal more, stay home? That's one measure know works 100%. People like selfish, risk infection. Plant farming without major issues either fair. massive dead zone Mississippi Delta due fertilizer runoff. I’d love know exactly consider “horseshit” studies (or study showing benefit effectiveness, matter). basis claim, right? crap it'll put us right direction instead plateauing 40k cases day. whether agree me/us not. fact actively arrogantly endangering themselves, everyone around (including healthcare workers, literally risking lives help, called liars troubles).

I work healthcare either, feel way compassion (yes, even cynical ones) coronavirus deniers.

Obviously discussion moot, Hippocratic Oath, believe us deal incredible assholery day work careful judge do. Kudos every healthcare worker managed become cynical year.

And way, donating food different working COVID-19 patients, orders magnitude. hope realize that. Part backlog Missoula county, even remove entirety 211 cases reported Missoula today, record Montana. Yes overpopulation one main problems asked average american that? wanna get head shot blown off?  lacks god-tier genetics! needs call dr demon sperm asap get salmonella vegetables. guess that’s something avoid possibly happen! makes bad bad person. realize insane sound, yet claim others anti vax eating meat natural humans. arguments awful. need another classification that. thinking lines ""ready pop."" lmao, wonder he's still disbelief It’s bad karma hope someone die Well, continue think way, ask strict measures get annoyed one 'strong' are. instead accept humans like wearing masks, focus getting comply scenarios really impactful.

I guarantee pragmatic strategy much successful. delay AZ give adequate information quick investigation. Even though supposedly investigation themselves. 

This add up. virus shown united states players. false prophets. dont shit together all. ruse People asking trump shut country down, including democrats. obviously right move considering that’s world. didn’t mess Luckily many cases then.  vaccine magically end precautions overnight. Ignore reality peril family. Go supermarket late friday night watch fill carts perfectly good meat hit ""best by"" date. Source, worked supermarket I'd see toss piles steaks, etc. hated seeing it. owned stock companies fortunes would risen $27.5% too. Yeah, that's officials [gloating herd time. issue foudational. Critical thinking longer taught meaningful way many areas. benefit questioning authority, accepting idea presented you. However, enable someone compare two opinions determine valid, assess two authorities differing stances determine one followed. people believe crazy ideas, accept correlation causation (5G coronavirus theory prime example), blindly follow leaders, matter outrageous statements are.

Parents, teach kids critical thinking! The.future depends it. month-long pause imposed American regulator investigates possible side-effects. Trust me, joke since 1865 crime rate skyrocketed thanks Civil War. Fuck.

It's really time governments around world would match small studies contact tracing data, make reasoning public base new suggestions restrictions this. clickbait 

anybody money thoughtfully invested seen healthy profit past 6-8 months. stock market fire would fool didn’t put money started. logic, can't claim wearing mask effect.

And logic can't claim wearing inside anywhere ever effect either. work one setting work settings filtration properties said mask change. clue markets work. Great post don’t think s/he laughing deaths, rather actions leaders FL. didn’t say would kill 4 million people. CDC estimates 2018/2019 flu season flu vaccines prevented 4.4 million people U.S. getting sick flu. Oh yeah. totally get taxes annoying, I'm sure I'll much experience annoyance get older. right I'm sometimes kept night fearful thoughts happen age parent's insurance. I'm lucky still expensive medications. need medications quality life, *could* survive without them. T1 diabetic friends can't afford miss dose physically can't afford insulin. want better future people like people like me. pay little extra percentage wages sleep night knowing medication suddenly taken me, it. 

When chronically ill view Healthcare system differently. Frankly, hurts dad scoffs whenever express concerns country's Healthcare system. baffles someone close chronically ill person think better system necessary, fact makes better understand people connection chronically ill people empathy fears. free market billionaires need exist. capping amount wealth individual accrue would ripple effect throughout economy. would mean less investment private sector, boosts GDP, productivity, creates jobs. money always effectively allocated private sector, funneled bureaucracy corruption public sector. outrageous wealth taxes socialist societies always failed. 

i agree taxing people based income principle, obvious flaws system (tax havens etc.). doubt billionaires also moral responsibility philanthropic allocate wealth. say billionaires exist ""no need much money"" incredibly short sighted way looking it.  I've seen reposted bunch times, people start adding ""X person &lt;-"" arrow know correlate news? people never stand net public outside, they? fair thing someone party attacks others things like this. Republicans tend throw stones glass house. sure got everything right, mainly gist. People eat plant based burgers eat gamey meats.

I also see deer meat suddenly going massively cheaper beef large scales. could least get way. Good...keep there. - NJ Resident. Desantis lifted restrictions Miami Dolphins allowing full stadium 65,000 fans. think they're going ever go back buying ppe like used to?

Not long medicine for-profit business. us understand science know distancing masking stop Americans vaccinated. ignorance influence us. president made plea fell deaf ears. Let’s phase fast food industry since one same. honestly American even know even involve worlds politics. even need to. money Texas, one stinking rich ass (Bush family) could keep doctors’s safe. What’s going doctors die?? get vaccine trial vaccine comes matter. purpose trials determine problems vaccine specific black people. known certain medications, vaccines, treatments react differently different ethnicities. vaccine works 80 percent efficacy caucasians European descent 10% races....thats problem. trying avoid. certainly understand black Americans would reluctant take part trials case exact trials run world US. participating getting vaccine means (at least US) already vulnerable population may get benefit vaccines impart population large. government drug companies explain purpose trials, reassure explain benefits drawbacks participating. realize Sweden distancing requirements restaurants they've shut follow guidelines, right?

Or Sweden close achieving herd immunity? worked one full “sovereign citizen” anti-tax nutjob. Mind shitty programmer too. Especially since studies proven vitamin really helps getting less severe sympyoms Covid 19. Measures like might harm public health covid well oyher illnesses economy Ironic right?

The easiest way get things ""back normal"" make things safe possible.

The business school superintendent manager downplays virus, weary makes consumer, parent, employee. Nah.  
I saw similar post morning, refrained commenting it.  
But one point feel sucks see people always blaming rich poverty.  


My point simple clear, take responsibility future try change it.  


I posted another comment people could seen investments grow like Bezos, met downvotes instead questions.  
So.. that's that. “They say keeping lockdown policies place vaccine available would cause ""irreparable damage, underprivileged disproportionately harmed"".

The health harms cited include:

*lower childhood vaccination rates
* worsening care heart disease cancer patients

And point risk coronavirus 1,000 times greater old infirm, children risk flu Covid-19.

this would much ""compassionate"" approach.
The declaration recommends number measures protect vulnerable, 

including regular testing care-home workers, move far possible towards using staff acquired immunity.

Retired people living home groceries essentials delivered, says.

And possible, meet family members outside rather inside.

Simple hygiene measures, hand washing staying home sick, practised everyone.

But:

young low-risk individuals allowed work normally

schools universities open in-person teaching

sports cultural activities could resume restaurants reopen”




Please consider reading article making mind. still disagree that’s prerogative. kind people wear masks worst kind people, turns out. wouldn’t, right? makes little sense it’s even funny anymore.

These two deaths thing lazily shoved category ""Covid 19"" deaths. One isn't. Sorry without direct evidence I’ll go magazine well known accuracy. That’s reality live in. Bars New York reached phases could actually open.

Everyone else outside.... ever lockdown masking TB? covid causing deaths despite measures. 

does TB adequate testing world wide know accurately many deaths causes? TB impact one part world whole world? TB contagious currently 10% way world population? last week (about 1 added per day), yesterday 3 deaths reported total. total 9. Since week 35 weekly deaths less 14 (so less 2 per day) changed report. go store inhale cloud covid.

And reopen shopping malls again? Take consideration frequent cross-checks happening deaths registries daily reports. perspective, +2 deaths [8 and/or +22 [15 No, I'm saying article incorrect.

that's unacceptable. still equal amount people die medical malpractice idk I'm sure there's point somewhere ain't making Well fair flu vaccine We’ve “bet” kinds things curb covid. know anything rules UK, situation city united states i'd get tested couple days negative results came back. time would sure wear mask anything ""extra"" skip work unless told to, since afterall, negative test. second one would peace mind British crown conditioned

that seems mental development ended. Never got bullied high school. encountered enough jackasses like various service jobs years realize people self-important, shallow assholes worth getting know literally nothing interesting contribute social interaction.

I’m lucky live country strong labour protection, sick leave mandatory law first two weeks given without doctors notice. employer doesn’t comply this, they’re trouble. state made even easier year making sure get compensated day one sick. (It used case first day sickness unpaid, get compensated rest sickness. get compensated every day miss, there’s strong financial motivation keep working despite symptoms)

I’m afraid dying either, fact may actually (couldn’t test back then). worry people hold dear risk groups.

Regarding excess deaths. Literally every country checked lot excess deaths accounted official Corona casualties, [including explained people reckless, serious experts agree Corona-deaths underreported. virus really brutal specific demographics. Nah, bullshit. like rest Spain much better. 



Instead taking actual kind measures would help, Madrid central government chosen one would hurt less short term Drugs vaccines apples oranges comparison. would willing roll sleeve right take one leading vaccine candidates, would want first line new drug potential unforeseen side effects could much greater Trump numbers buddy! *cries American* Exited op common points. 5-year average actual deaths places puts mortality around 2017 levels. Unless population median age remained static, going get rotten results take 2020 actual deaths minus 2017 deaths claim difference entirely due people dying covid thing found interesting methodology. determining survivability surfaces air. using new gadget suspend droplets mid-air exposing different light sources temperatures different periods time see well survive. aired news TV futuristic :) Europe crisis. many cases , much suffering.

I'm praying them. Flu passed years ago That's high number deaths :( Hope become trend assume shorter *longer*? Apparently definition ""civil war"" lost people... IIRC European countries set system people laid continue paid 80% last salary, however running funds keep rolling. handle another ~12 months?  example directly Covid-related. mean say locking country limit spread virus? Ok, breathe alone home don’t need mask please stay there. like Batman ties bad guy 20 minute mark knowing full well back keep inflicting pain people next 90 minutes.

Kill bad guy move on. Sure more, always tyrants long permit ignorance allow gradual reduction standards leaders.

Trump getting ass kicked election fairly won’t stop racist resurgence. Kaiser defeated fair square end World War Two two decades later, nazism hitler rose direct result - defeat, sanctions winning countries imposed Germany resulting lower standard living many allowed the, initially, real nazis take power mindshare. Finally somewhere decent strategy! need permission... usually pay. folks holds songwriting rights often like covers made, especially song becomes hit; make money every time airs sold. Think Roy Orbison minded Van Halen covering Pretty Woman? RIP, Eddie. say essence. Person, woman, man, TV, camera Amazed there's hospital bed big enough hold funny, say US mess locked two-party system, Israeli relatives say Israel mess two-party system, means tiny psycho right-wing just-murder-everybody parties vastly disproportionate amount power.

So might something comment. concerning, considering he's made point seen every day far... yes often ask can't like USSR market flooded fake N95 respirators. Companies China slap N95 logo send here. tested, masks provide stated level protection therefore used health care setting. Yes, I've lot outdoor activities around people, always masked, mostly day. maintain distance, usually 6 ft like 3-4 ft. I've tested three times events gave reason tested, come back negative time.

Of course one data point, experience. President careful all, got virus. ""Half"" 

It's seriously even close that. Barely fifth, max He's likely talking article passed around 5 trial participants interviewed. probably find different publications it.

A couple big problems: symptoms described would actually fall severe category typical vaccines, cleared less 24 hours posed lasting harm, patients know whether got vaccine placebo source information, least one set descriptions ""full covid symptoms"" including lung symptoms actually make sense vaccines using virus. part appeared early variations article, conveniently taken recent versions.

In short, search want to, post kinda hinky lot holes it. also mostly article getting passed around different publication names.

I think that's part problem this. look preventative measure deem 'perfect' acceptable. ie: 

- 6 feet social distancing 'useless' since transmission happen distances much further, especially outside wind
- Regular masks 'useless', since filter even large particles
- Testing 'useless', could early days infection enough viral load positive
- N95 masks 'useless', custom form fitted person's face proper seal work right
- Face shields 'useless' air flow get underneath
- Gloves 'useless' changed frequently

Stop lazy work ass off, complain. close it’s true Tyson sucks Really? still want contest masks aren’t important part things? think smarter that. zoonotic illnesses jump humans bacteria become antibiotic resistant misuse antibiotics factory farms, viruses bacterial infections avoid infecting people contribute problem. infect everyone put everyone's health risk. guy labeled cynic? doctor take sample COVID infected mucus, put microscope, take picture virus particles phone show patient like “WHAT THOSE” called covid fatigue really present. Berlin police need end illegal parties every day. Lol, come now... thought schools opened there. wrong, wrong. takes cycles infection see relaxation mitigation’s make difference, that’s Nearly 500,000 deaths smoking every year fine it’s contagious? talking violent deaths young men women families lives ahead them. talking mostly sick elderly. Statements like misleading really care view haha.

Your logic totally flawed. can't contribute deaths directly indirectly caused coronavirus corona virus deaths. account human agency decisions. leads totally inaccurate understandings pandemic allows people authority beyond reproach. also makes seem like agenda, frankly, need distort figures way otherwise. true, Spanish flu people social distanced, (flyers still exist today telling people so) also knew virus were, many large gatherings banned. 

Also virus’s discovered late 1800’s Wednesday FHM cross-check data death register add deaths missing. typically day highest number deaths, time backlog last weeks. Thanks another global virus China! Regarding point B, simply true. I've movie theaters four times since July and, since time, I've gotten 7 7 negative COVID tests. theaters I've people spaced out, everyone wearing masks. Hand sanitizers free use, nobody talked movie way droplets spread. I'm saying going theater risk-free, ""incredibly stupid"" going grocery store. say, chance part superspreader event movie theater low kind panic unneccessary. Another one articles use bottom crash starting point number million month ago, recall. Knowledge fighting clearly gotten alot better since then.  things bad expected. good. Still bad though.  Could easily lower people dumb. someone quit eating meat “production” process, yes, add list. Make horrible virus something nudges society right direction. It’s cleared skies brought wild animals hiding. might well curb overconsumption foods bad us bad everything else. lmao Spanish flu happened 1918. war ended 1918. accurate number posted?  Dr. Mark Ghaly, state's top public health official, said Tuesday take time trends emerge, far results encouraging used examples need see least *46* weeks I’ll even consider opening moon roof minivan, much less take Sammy school! Well, countries choses use comparison Sweden. FPTP another huge issue Yes can. Whatever makes feel better :) America going pay destruction death inflicted millions Middle Easterners dead Vietnamese civilians? Enough American exceptionalism. true though, people take seriously quicker might able get cases less people die. Pelosi, Schiff Mad Maxine 3 people scare ever loving shit me. anyone could still vote astonishing. cases confirmed, let’s shut everything. covid indemnity clause. 4.2% immunocompromised people US. Everyone one isolated every healthy person kept living life. Let’s sacrifice 335 million lives 15million. Absolute horse shit fear mongering. Yeah, somehow don’t think anything gunna sustainable. Nobody Europe plans make whole lockdown. Berlin bars restaurants need close 11 pm 6 every day. think whole Europe needs lockdown soon spreads fast almost EU states. Yet, 4600 people died China.... almost like someone lying (cough CHINA cough) caused Americans ill prepared dangerous virus. I’ll get downvoted saying anyone Trump fault this. Dr. Mark Ghaly, state's top public health official, said Tuesday take time trends emerge, far results encouraging

Are Trusting Scientists™ news article fits certain narrative? I’m confused point. I'm glad laugh mistakes :D So? American fighting leave. flu worse /s Stop defending Sweden, fucking hell.  Fair enough. basically everyone said masks effective though. There's nothing wrong compassion.  However, go things eyes open.

Steven Miller would spit needed compassion. 

Anyway, aware type people feel compassion would show none roles reversed. Yes, medical professionals working far overtime feverish pace stage fake virus crisis. Dude stop fucking defending Sweden oh god.

Like why? defend country commiting crimes? effect result virus existence. Ergo, virus subsumes deaths.

Believe whatever want, you’re coming across bright here. Freedom! Murica! Constitution! Amendment! fck ""viewpoint"". 


Just idiots opposing view point mean consider it. Hello, Based study, transposing death rate 100/100000 today's population see COVID would need total 330,000 today's population considered deadlier flu United States.

This study seems highlight higher mortality rate Influenza compared COVID compared deaths per 100,000 people US. right? I'm little familiar topic. One common thing little business called walmart. Frequently, they'll go small towns set shop sell stuff loss time order drive local businesses grocers business. they're supplier left area, jack prices again. Sometimes walmart decides certain location longer profitable enough operate shuts down. South Carolina first succeed revolutionary civil war. They'd accurate 

signed flu epidemiologist Sadly, remaining Trump voters country care.

1. decided long ago, weird reason, believe anything Fauci says.
2. Trump told like flu. get lot discrediting sad sacks shit happy keeping everything closed forever. i’m sorry hear :c hope things improve soon, stay healthy safe would great way rack death threats crazies there. Midwest. public schools in-person virtual. son goes private school full time. taking precautions. symptom 9 month pregnant sister had! couldnt smell taste. like, 3 days, completely fine. funny people used tell us believe everything read internet believing everything read internet. Spain Belgium still first world countries worse US, UK France around numbers. again, aside Germany, EU much different US. crazy high, hospitalization keeps increasing. got tested free, paid sanepid. Mid August Warsaw. contact positive covid case, results available next day, ended 36h quarantine research people signed this? long term effects? go *very well* sub 😂 

“No *those* scientists! would still need vote electoral voters. vote, least chance, don’t, lose it. don't. Ending sentence ""nothing else"" change that. good documentary subject free watch online. fuck sake learned *nothing* Lol enjoy downvotes. 
You reddit, every jackass wants rich without struggling it. near many Vietnamese, Koreans, Iraqis Afghans. Cases rise many states.  Plenty states countries it’s decline. Meaningless sense you’re ignoring overwhelming data. That’s point.  

Herd immunity solution?  You’re one hasn’t personally impacted then. had, wouldn’t callus suggesting idiotic means helping economy. isn’t choice economy death millions.  It’s using heads get virus como two es first. Herd immunity works reach 70% infection, slows down. problem solution is...millions die disease, definitive proof can’t get twice, real understandings king term impact getting virus, and, sure mentioned, millions DIE!! WTF news channel watching? Whatever is, stop turn research inform scientific facts. hoe haven’t personally impacted loved one dying hope never virus hits home many, changes opinions based reality 1 lost life.  Let alone hundreds thousands. need help risk death stop putting others harms way. Wake man!  People dying! Suggesting due save economy?  And, yes, I’m sure fix news based opinion people dying due economic hardship, job loss more....and, yes, that’s horrible COVID. reason need everyone take virus shit serious. can’t fix economy virus tearing fucking country/economy like wild fire California.  honestly think killing millions using herd immunity help economy? truly hope not. Damn. Straw man.

Funny one easily look around globe find dozens examples handle leading pandemic. Repeating make so. totally refuse see role restrictions, economic downturn public messaging play health outcomes. barmy mate. mom pop shops close 

And Bezo's fault gave career open online shop ???? like eat smoke plants. like South Korea think? Everyone wears masks everywhere. Covid ""overdispersed"" also infectious period TB lasts long time. means active wave covid spread many people. couple weeks, wave die (if there's lockdown, say). TB last people keep infecting long time. covid like seasonal respiratory viruses, comes punches spikes. TB constant.

Overdispersed means covid spreads superspreading events. makes spread uneven even little bit social distancing affect big time. fact social distancing lot places affects it.

It's also seasonal, probably, winter probably kills most. likely kill 2 million end year, that's social distancing. could potentially kill many seasonal effect high.

That's significantly worse TB, imagine world without social distancing.

&amp;#x200B;

One last concept ""casedemic"" people argue overestimated harms. doctors countries also argued this. people also connected pandemic fatigue anti-government beliefs. Many, most, scientists still worried covid - data clear deadly, start change minds more? 

There reason places like Japan, Africa, Pakistan seem well. know yet, many possible explanations something like herd immunity probably one them. need learn little bit this. infections indeed home. infection clusters originate bars restaurants. maNY uNdeRlYinG cOndiTioNS!!? Jailing doctors, journalists, lawyers

""they leaders government calling hoax politicizing mask wearing. ""

No, doctors pleading world take COVID seriously Chinese police rounded threw jail. think he'll ever working Dr. Sweden? wonder percent people died first years flu versus now? Surely new virus knock people weren’t prepared physically medically latest threat? Thanks facebook heavily denied severity it. Said going away soon bad flu.


It's pure denialism.. stop... Vietnam one Enchanting quest chains terrorist hates America much less abstract people virus. fighting Americans

And win? No? wear mask though pretty easy: family gatherings produce money rest unless paying entire categories would shut down, makes perfect sense. don’t think aware potentially destructive staying war China could be. would likely starts WW3. drugs  rarely hug interact people gyms way family, guess? infections happen work place home (in opinion) that's interact physically close others, increases transmission risk.  Less 10% it. Crop duster reddit post much. casually get time time see different opinions what’s going on. Lol, alright. Don’t believe agree. Internet still worth $115 billion cares world? Mask protocols really shown us deeply vested/obsessed people compliance protocols..

Makes wonder people over.

I suppose migrate obsession next crisis.. New Zealand eliminated community transmission 1 May. single outbreak since then, 11 August, completely contained virus eliminated. inevitable new cases govt proven contain prevent community transmission. 

In last 2 months cases slipped border 3 times three times cases caught almost immediately contained using contact tracing, Covid app isolation sick close contacts govt run facilities. contained without increase alert levels. Gyms closing - cafeterias sporting clubs seems SNL producers think rules poor shows. think INSTITUTION, see.  Totally agree. think failure started 80s 90s. Covid spreads warmer weather not? Wow good guess. four phase 3 seven stages development/clinical trial, total 11 vaccine candidates. would say America continent, island. fact could physically infect people, fact little mask tantrum stunt potentially infected minds millions people. $150

the article says.

That's low price potentially contracting deadly disease. think Last Week Tonight made whole video years ago horribly media misrepresents science. Basically read lot articles get dumber every single one. speech therapist able come us home, summer completely shut visiting individual homes safety reasons.

To answer second question, speech therapy actually start kid even verbal! kid intubated first several months life, often causes problems oral development, ""speech therapy"" starting around 6 months old. age actually like feeding therapy, that's primary activity lips tongue, guess tell things signs future speech problems. one American idiot playing virus down,while infecting others gay abandon, 1980s would condemned. honestly prove closing bars etc causes either. Cases take several days appear importantly diagnosed yet drops started next day. tenously shows closures caused drop. Don’t worry, we’ll get another 4 years, real fast. ""Only Republicans would put economy public health.""  


Oh ups. way movie theatres disappearing forever. economic reality happens. bit year ago, AVENGERS ENDGAME made close $3 billion. PVOD releases happened since pandemic even come close that. studio going leave much money table.

Things change though. You’ll likely see fewer screens US (in long run necessarily bad thing opinion... chains overbuilt 90s 00s). Maybe even bring tier pricing movies. Perhaps studios partner theaters financially. knows? theaters survive. nothing suggest he’s minus cop charge. Anything defend “him abuser?” Curious know much audience members paid. can't imagine attending live taping SNL top anyone's priority list pandemic. I’m little confused supposed limit size family gatherings yet schools, gyms bars open? It’s little contradicting opinion.

Source: Canadian pretty easy answer this. think people generally social distance wear masks, might choose take risk. Especially live around vulnerable people.

If people probably careless virus, take risk.

Here's two things think about:

1) take risks again, one time luck runs out. Look Trump. So, one time going unlucky time? answer could probably won't. know, way evaluate risk know behavior people.

2) theory, social distancing well, yes would perfectly fine take risks. Maybe even reasonable so. might perfectly protected virus, little risk okay. However, group people taking high risks frequently, bother. love called ""china's experimental vaccine"". like 7 something development, phase 3 case anyone pity mercy Stephen Miller diagnosis, let's brief reminder sound children (multiple) utmost distress separated parents immigration centre.

I following looking areas pandemic could handled better Sweden. However, looking back now, FHM much close real numbers predictions spring 22 scientists, particular Nele Brusselaers Cecila Nauclér, saying kind weird shit completely there. may different nations ""types"" people exist countries, cautious carefree, empathetic sociopath.  


There shit ton misinformation there, information people getting facebook media sources hyperbole every single dramatic event fear gets ratings. Perhaps might recognise SARS1 MERS dodged bullet were, plenty others use apply covid19 ""here go hype"" 


The interesting thing bits history look Spanish flu - anti mask rallies, anti lockdown sentiment, denial, stupid behaviour etc etc, prevalent now. Nothing changed general public 100 years. I'd surprised changed next 100, without borders. I'm sure assume denial comes America. far know Trump never denied existence COVID-19. famous person I'm aware denied existence COVID-19 David Icke, British conspiracy theorist. Wow 1000 karma account came activity two weeks post Trump defending wall text?

Wow strange occurrence death 80 year old less tragedy death 20 year old Thank you! cant right. Live sweden, medical professionals wear masks theres risk infection. enemies great state.

US, I’m sure places level restriction right now. always re-wash soap (which works fine), frozen items freezer. treat freezer like biohazard.

Basically, although fomites probably last long enough surfaces problem, someone say sneeze frozen items groceries cold temperatures certainly could preserve virions. Meanwhile, bring home freezer go.

So, let groceries sit day without wiping them, always wash comes freezer use it. lay surfaces without washing those.

Might paranoid, another way look probably need wipe dry groceries. I'm sorry I'm going travel anywhere 50 miles town there's vaccine.

Something like 85% voters *never* vote across isle (statistic pulled memory, can't source, sorry)

2. Extreme single issue voters. Americans polled (something like 85%) favor greater gun control, vote strongly favor it, half even vote times (that's presidential, even less senate/congress, even worse state/local). 15% Americans firmly gun control would vote Hot Pastrami Sandwich democrat ever said anything negative guns, *definitely* vote, every time without fail.

Instead lizard sized pea brain decided medical professionals blame. still Americans way everyone living Americas American. succeeded United States America caught though. understand personally agree. old enough remember Thalidomide? takes one member public get neurological problem msm claiming vaccine unsafe properly tested. vaccine pulled nobody get particular vaccine. vaccines development particular problem. one would want administered yours? not, someone car wearing seatbelt crash go flying without seatbelt kill them. think lost cannot understand that. Furthermore incapacitated crash lose control vehicle hit others. 

Masks mandated stop spread, vaccine situation improved 100% believe longer mandatory. Stop selfish. they? Evangelicals Trump serve God: Money. 

The real tragedy many small churches, genuine beliefs, go along achieve political goals instead protecting reputation loudmouth grifters. Netherlands Thanks. sure missed that. agree you; that's nearly enough. That's less minimum rate background actors. Show tapings take ridiculous amount time would want room bunch unmasked strangers breathing place.

I would need paid heck lot even consider it. Smh. Yeah, seems like issue Confederates rather south general. states free join Union also free leave? That's treason charge hold. problem anti lockdown people go deep end. guy work recently telling spent hours titty bar. I'm sure some, workers bar fine upstanding people. But, tend younger, carries lower covid risk. Also uncommon workers OD. people heroin meth, may tend take covid seriously.  Thus worry contact person spent time establishment click-bait, story goes say majority scientists disagree, ‘experts’ include Dr. Phil.   Family reunions like weddings standard super spreader events people spend many hours together indoors talking loudly close contact, hugs etc.

Bars bad well, tbh closed. They're less bad family gatherings.

Gyms allright think, never saw much bad things happening gyms. Maybe they're stickler correct. speech therapy actually start kid even verbal!

Fascinating! Thanks input “What experts say?

While clearly ""well intentioned"", declaration profound ethical, logistical scientific flaws, University Leeds school medicine associate professor Dr Stephen Griffin says.

The vulnerable come walks life deserve ""treated equally"".

And ""long Covid"" reported left even people mild infections problems fatigue joint pain months.

University Reading cellular biology expert Dr Simon Clarke, meanwhile, says whether herd immunity even achievable remains unclear.

""Natural, lasting, protective immunity disease would needed,"" says.

""And know effective long-lasting people's post-infection immunity be.""

Some say likely scenario immunity long-term future reinfections become milder.” They've done everything right. sure sub hard time understanding ""squashed"" anything come back. dealing correctly. me, ""squashed"" means done, wrap. Everything rosey good. probably temporary that's ""squashing"". Guess definition varies. 

And they're vs rest world really matter discussion. saying 785 million people infected? needs cost money all. that, sure, fine. comment even get upvoted first place? makes sense first glance, becomes way worse actually get point trying make. New Zealand government said new rules defeat covid please look loop holes exploit. 14 days without community transmission. think social media (starting youtube) got people make things first jokes get followers.

The earliest things popular conspiracies platforms 911 (building 7, pentagon, hologram...), UFO's, Moon landing (old conspiracy ignited SM), more.

Soon became trend doubt whatever popular thing including tragedies like Sandy hook etc. 

You predict conspiracy groups say. take topic people believe bother think much say opposite. 

In early January many conspiracy sites including one popular news site starts Z (I mention it) actually said coronavirus serious issue governments trying hide it. Back China battling world shut down. everyone started shut majority said corona serious, site changed everything around say corona hoax. would that?  years back vaccine wasnt effective, 61k died america. guy looks like big lebowski / pappy Daniel Thanks Donny! Semantics wars still cost millions lives, American lives. Vietnam 3 million, Iraq 1.2 million Lol gets grinds gears. U.S. touts ""Never Forget"" every year 9/11 yet relative comparison we're approaching 100 times many deaths single year virus, could feasibly mitigate.

I understand foreign actors committed 9/11 atrocities ## life life ##. Consider virus foreign (to bodies) invisible actor is. shame united fucking virus up.

Side note: need keep fighting pushing Congress support health costs men women still affected 9/11.

Another side note: going lingering health issues (physical mental) thousands people pandemic pay for. I've lost respect many people virus, including several comedians. Even Joe Rogan isnt really taking seriously: says tests everybody comes podcast watched show Donnell Rawlings months ago didnt even get test results back *after* they'd recording three fucking hours. lol fuuuuuuck low-effort, brain-mush. 

Biden would listen experts. Biden would already second relief bill passed.

What Biden wouldn’t twitter flip-flop drug induced meltdowns it.



Fuck you. bad day! Idiot. That's taking 1.1M deaths / 785M infected per dying 

Social media lot blame that. know estimate actually 6,000,000 dead Middle East 32,000,000 people displaced - since 2001.  Right now, yes, virus still lives on. They've done great job hopefully continue so. there's death hospitals get overcrowded, pretty much happened Italy. That's needed flatten curve. mention fact developed countries highly dependent China many vital products, like many medicines keeping millions people alive made nowhere else planet. Sorry? Barack Obama oversaw largest bailout history, Wall Street. 

Mainstream democrats wall streets pocket same. said there's point it? !remindme 1year Nearly aaaaaaaaaaaaall fascists 1st rule journalism: headline asks question, answer ""No."" 42,000 cases yesterday, white house cluster, yet we're acting like everything fine.   slow burn happening tons uninfected left including people risk easy target. Might well add 9/11 total too.  Maybe play movies Trump fans would love? real numbers already us well 250k. Experts calling 400k January 1st. vaccine work people take it, could well 750k end next year Isn’t depressing it’s simple yet many refuse it? sustained weight loss, people Covid instead Netflix food they’d also decrease vulnerability Still can’t find .13% Fuck it.

Fuck boomers fuck fat people. Poland, Czech Republic, Belgium similar path... I'm one them. know Earth roughly sphere.

Round Earth model proposed flat-earthers: .

I guess 66% roughly represents average education. average believe Earth round, albeit different reasons. get fired. Replaced likely herd immunity guy. Trump's rabid supporters blast love Trump. Trump reelected idiot CDC four years. Trump already said deserves 8 followed Ivanka. sacrifice nothing. Young heathy Americans old 70 year old Americans ? Well, was... quote ""If vote ain't black?"" insane. Two super spreader events back back days. Trump like screw it, I'll create herd immunity infecting anyone come contact with. know causes new virus bacteria ? Animals, factory farming. antibiotics produced world factory animals, helping super-bacterias develop though. Stephen Miller quarantine 5 days since people administration started testing positive. tested negative 4 days row tested positive fifth day. negative test doesn’t mean aren’t contagious. JFC gymnastics people went avoid wearing little piece cloth face. put fucking mask on. Instead approaching “we wearing masks, also testing, anyone positive test able enter event” abused rapid tests prophylactic. way abuse every privilege. privilege people don’t access able use rapid tests daily basis. Idaho care pandering snowflake republicans get re-elected care public health.  Oops. Typo. I’ll fix it. Interesting... Miami last week city mandate required everyone wear mask, even outside 🤷‍♂️ really hold true given know happened though. immediately took hospital checked in. clearly knew risks took anyways. probably assumed given bubble White House supposed get would low risk exposure. 

You guys invent alternative narratives sometimes actually match facts reality. Bruh...

I Indian living Europe.I seen countries sorry would ever see.I worked fast food survive . teach grow. 


COMMENTING PEOPLE CHICKEN REPORTING COMMENTS. 
The problem anti lockdown people go deep end. guy work recently telling us spent hours titty bar. I'm sure some, workers bar fine upstanding people. But, tend younger, carries lower covid risk. Also uncommon workers OD. people heroin meth, may tend take covid seriously.  Thus worry contact person spent time establishment. really think US whole, could come far better plan combat virus. Seems like modern factory farming thats problem, meat eating general. cant phase factory farms without finding adequate replacement em. People probably dont want give cheap meat better health safety end. He’s getting deserves. Remember locked bridge full people like 24 hours he’s petty. sympathy Christie. technicality views I'm liberal ok blind tribalism destroying America. Also wew can't wait infect everyone 0.013 death rate virus. pathetic media lives totally rent free head instructs isolate family rest life. morning, President Trump falsely claimed tweet coronavirus “in populations far less lethal"" flu.  people United States died already coronavirus died influenza past five flu seasons combined.

I know Trump's tweet true not, think COVID serious flu. 

However, really bad article CNN even begin address tweet question. 

The fatality rates COVID exponentially higher oldest age brackets almost negligible younger age brackets. may well case some/many/most age brackets death rate coronavirus even less influenza. Apparently CNN know this, figures. 

Coronavirus killed people overall, incompatible idea among certain age brackets, less lethal. Perhaps people caught influenza, perhaps deaths coming oldest age bracket. 

It's distressing see major news organizations scientific illiteracy, even get big picture right. Sure, lots preventative measures place, point caseload well within capacity medical system. individual residents, chance infection currently very, low. Wait, headline Onion? doctors susceptible idiocy anyone else. I'm live Wisconsin vegan. generally try avoid topic (lots reasons) LOOKS people give find I'm vegan... think I'd admitted committing violent crime. significant amount people literally can't even fathom voluntarily giving meat. literal way karma work people like this. Like exempt receiving health care. Active disinformation sharers marked, drop clasping throats, gasping air ambulance called rush get immediate care, would way crew take one look like ""eh, coronavirus denier. Never mind, boys, let's let one die street!"" Deny shit drive away, save someone accusing liars faking this.

I understand feel way deciding help human agree makes bad person. catch 22 unfortunately. Husband's work. results came back negative bit suspect me. may gone tested early. better compared countries worse compared others. Bars restaurants open part, hotels too, last three months tourism usual (I living several hotels, seen amount tourists first hand). Social distancing wearing masks mandatory part, public transportation wear mask (but almost controls also fines wear mask). Infection rates skyrocketing. comes Covid-19 would better delay trip vaccine next year. Well certain president saying need fear ripping mask may immune cares exposes others. making fun big mask Biden. approve this. /s got walking friends? brave them. cunt neododgingbullets.gif Agree 100%. Unfortunately reason fear, people living fear thing loudest. didn’t. MLB thing. sort put games close together proximity other’s cities. bubble extreme measure that. I'm sure plaintiffs prove got COVID work.

Of course could stronger legislation requiring safety standards, failing comply could cause action, but, obviously happen Aren’t California’s schools closed? like, think

Let stop right there; No, not. yikes... ain’t right man facts - misinterpretation. actual information page misunderstanding rationally interpret way did, even filtered sensationalist media linked to, anything close ""facts CDC"". used argue one colleagues. always felt ironic poorest people cities tend live areas access grocery stores, fast food expensive convenience stores (and course predatory loan shark type businesses). argued it’s really hard get situation people stuck there, literally everything area working them... low wage employment, poor food options, recreations park land typically affordable housing options find. seems purposefully setup keep poor people poor (and unhealthy). helps boost profits corporations running healthcare facilities boosts wages bonuses executives. immunity reached Sweden. case graph flattened. Fox News' legal team made case court - supposed consider Tucker Carlson seriously, he's fucking That's vegan antispeciesists keep saying since pandemic, we're still actually getting mocked downvoted that. Coronavirus likes this. would reply, apparently giving example get incivility.  1967, Cain graduated Morehouse College Bachelor Science mathematics. 1971, received Master Science computer science Purdue University, working full-time ballistics analyst U.S. Department Navy completing master's degree Purdue, Cain left Department Navy began working Coca-Cola Atlanta computer systems analyst. 1977, moved Minneapolis join Pillsbury, becoming director business analysis restaurant foods group 1978.

Morbid obesity RESULT poor decision-making, catching COVID-19 wearing mask taking precautions pandemic. even worse decision making considering numerous underlying health issues. need start letting people die. cancers humanity.

White House, worried criteria would delay authorization vaccine, presumably beyond Nov. 3 election, decided sit guidance. killed guy bridge. Chris Christie fat dog tick asshole jail. that’s huge mistake. Scientists skin game. present facts—not think people want hear. fact president reinforces conspiracy theories able trust physicians epidemiologists making problem worse. Hundreds health care professionals can’t wrong. Covid Urban Legends... Lots states lockdown pandemic majority Northeastern US  think least 2 3 from:

* Chris Fatboy Christie
* Trump
* one older senators got it
* someone young(er) relative good shape, biggest surprise, like Kayleigh McEnany (what shitty name spell) Stephen Miller. Remember people subreddit would freak call names dared suggest 50-60k projectsion back March unrealistically hopeful we'd hit 400k least? downvote post oblivion?

I remember. Yuo realize flattening curve curb spike hospitalizations right always happening beginning large outbreaks? countries, like mine Canada, succeeded that. Ones prepare (Italy), saw happen spiked deaths cases. people keep smart governments stay vigilant keep going things relative safety without seeing mass deaths like early on. 80-year-old man bar near Buffalo, N.Y., noticed fellow customer wearing face mask, confronted him. customer responded swiftly pushing ground, police said. Five days later, man dead.

On Monday, customer, Donald Lewinski, 65, West Seneca, N.Y., arrested charged criminally negligent homicide death 80-year-old, Rocco Sapienza. case believed one first kind New York State.

Mr. Lewinski pleaded guilty Tuesday court Erie County. charge carries four years prison.

The encounter followed months tension often vitriolic confrontations across country masks. Disputes escalated violence: Retail employees broken fistfights customers, New York City dozens transit workers attacked trying enforce rules.
Some encounters also turned deadly. New York City, woman died April wandered emergency room Brooklyn hospital shoved another patient, apparently become irate broken social distancing guidelines. Michigan, prosecutors said security guard Family Dollar store fatally shot May told customer daughter needed wear mask inside store. heard baby born without vital organs reported covid death. like $$$ calling shots. Compassion basis morality.

Not harming others basis morality, hth Nahh give real answer hard believe people stupid species sent people walk moon. fact, might best evidence moon landing hoax. species wide spread intelligence? womp womp That's point.

It's stupid argument try make states something scream oppression.  [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Or, know, maybe imperfect vaccine ""pretty safe"" better pandemic definitely safe. old duckling Minority Report real action. everyone wants get vaccine maybe can't. deserve treatment options also. important Honestly arguments dumb generalizations. Stupidity limited certain generations.

You're also way Gen X, exact opposite folks living bubble accepting everything parents taught them. reading subject. I'll preface with, believe mask social distancing work. look lockdowns America, New York New Jersey one extensive lockdown measures put place compared state America, yet highest death rate per capita state.  hope talk free, pennies pay it. that's case, younger NFL players (now feeling 20 years younger) learning walk, talk tell someone diaper full. think want that. So, high school kids, kids old enough study home without forcing parents stay home well? opposed shutting every Elementary school country? See difference?

""US exact thing Sweden"" really weird argument try back up. IDK trying. Dumb question, projected time stuff going over? know much take isn’t going popular, really wish would stop commenting appearance people don’t like. I’m firmly anti-Trump never commented appearance. It’s relevant individual insecurities related look. 

It’s low hanging fruit. Chris Christie obese, I’m sure he’s aware that. Let’s keep criticism directed policy poor decision making, instead constantly lampooning people look. Glad happening. It’s time people take personal responsibility stay home feel succumb virus get it. People willing take risk allowed so. main purpose lockdown always give time arrangement expansion medical facilities. impose lockdown areas medical capacity still mark. successful vaccine cure may never developed virus. even made, take months, perhaps years worldwide distribution. can’t lockdown till time China watchers know always skeptical China - look say like tea leaves floating bottom glass. one thing trust Chinese care whether foreigners actually believe lies. lies obvious ridiculousness.

I lived China long time too. Nothing works properly. time evil reasons. Sometimes doesn’t work.

Edit: way part Chinese culture - everyone consistently dishonest especially business mutual expectation dishonesty sides. It’s laowai don’t know culture think everything legally enforceable contracts verified facts problems there. first thought, too. many reasons away factory farming, we’re selfish it. *veganism intensifies* I’m saying Democrats comprehensive plan place, I’m saying opposition actively holding hostage vote. 

Whataboutism weak identity politics shit. Let’s hold representatives accountable regardless political party please. Vote.

I can't promise change mind Americans seemingly heartless care, damn sure change leadership heartless care.

Vote get science medicine back forefront, be, sanity back Oval Office. everything, step. important one. took seriously, gotten COVID. Indoctrination brain washing mourning jobs mourning people? LOL. American approach kind logic reason it. entire world making up???

That's part really blows mind talk covid denier IRL. 99.99 percent doctors scientists world actively conspiring together? Along nearly every media outlet planet? 

Seriously; Q-Anon Pizzagate thousand times credible covid conspiracy deniers believe in. Left Twitter 5 years ago never looked back, fucking cesspool. that's point i'm making all... even make correlation two things? bet fun parties. think fail, less succeeded first time?  everyone listened trusted scientists, try understand rationale even make mistakes, mankind would much, much better place. 

I believe Fauci, fortunately. wear goggles time go out, even take trash chute. I've got 2 years food apartment I'll survive. try take 3 days month escape mountains outside much want see single person. I'll survive.
 
If can't get pandemic ever going handle space colonization? take vitamins mental health. End 2021 still sooner one way trip Mars would be, right? covid hoaxers constantly dare us, sheep, prove wrong facts even single fact contrary nonsense given, proclaim facts lies distorted. come realize absolutely nothing say change mind even inkling. hopeless battle. comment ignorant child. I'm New Jersey I'm literally dying. laughter. Governor Murphy much better. would expect part ruling. Lol, nuts? Care offer proof? even Sweden claims nonsense wife works doctors office allowed bring N95 masks, use office supplied surgical masks. Administration afraid people also wanting N95's. stop trying gaslight science. audience stupid are, argument weak get traction.

I provided nice big graph showing age deaths age. take stable orange uper genius see statement: average age covid deaths US higher avg. life expectancy US.

is flat lie.

also, underlying insinuation comment, someone dying entirely preventable disease statistical life expectancy somehow acceptable, disgusting. Countries could go (more) debt distribute money needed significantly raise taxes ultra wealthy refill coffers, that's going happen, risking thousands lives is. Wrong. Corona travel air fourteen feet. fools don’t wear masks outdoors unless hiking ten miles civilization. Don’t selfish. Israeli doctor response possible actually explains lot. Trump didn’t fully comprehend fiscal ramifications blamed Fauci economy started tank.

Ever since, stopped listening Fauci’s recommendations emphasized strategy opening everything back again. genuine moron think fake havent seen watch smarter every day video twitter manipulation. eye opening Even doesn't, what? think debt service consumes 100% pay? Outdoor risk generally less indoors, still high low risk depending lot factors including occupancy/density, activity, exposure time. 

See figure 
So imaging masks providing benefit say crowded outdoor plaza marketplace. Oblate* 

Because I'm even annoying version guy... look covid deaths per million Spain especially Belgium much worse US.

Still, US poorly weak comparisons, know cherry picking two examples countries worse US. [Number people ICU also rising slowly buy steadily last month nowhere near filling 5000 ICU beds, yet. (It increased little 7000 peak)

The Paris region 1/3 ICUs hospitalizations. O'Reilly. think point getting across.

They suck echo chambers, however, act echo chambers following people talk things. Like said run misinformation, politics, climate change, sexism, etc. 

Because follow people post 90 percent mutual shared interests. follow accounts posts hobbies primary account. super easy. Every home depot literally half aisle floor ceiling surgical masks. N95s harder come by, visited doctor dentist months ago, wearing N95s. Why? made 417K last year. feel bad all. He's financially stable entire life, influential government position, never went work risk bankruptcy.

They fail. guy said accept deaths. Apparently include statement. Pffft. There's still many undecided angry  Oh Cuomo Well surely Spanish case death rates minimal wearing masks everywhere. Oh wait. world war 1950s Europe killed thousands everyday like 1940s?

Crazy. hop two hospital beds

Nice. took minute get joke. fat obese orangeturd/tard cant get fucking shit together even batshit insane. think entire strategy daily rapid testing provided everyone Trump’s orbit false sense security. really ever would taken one false negative cause outbreak like this, fact took long made feel invincible laughed peasants forced wear masks stay socially distant. fact they’re part COVID-denier cult probably didn’t help.

So, um, lesson learned Trumpworld — kind act like rest us there’s vaccine. assume government absolutely nothing help citizens.  one controls me, Skippy. Still blows mind people good portion US population still believes masks social distancing doesn’t work. can’t even begin imagine amount people still think pandemic hoax sort Wow sucks. place work (Sweden) upper management started really clamping working home wanted people work office more. corona happened, think there's many people office twice since march. ugh..paywalled. lot comments twitter really enrage turn bots accounts specific agenda. also gastric band surgery lose weight.

I make note hard way watch enough ww2 documentaries. really invaded D-day majority u.s. deaths 

Also people knowing casualties fatalities, wounded missing.

U.S. deaths WW2 407,316. 
291, 000 rounded combat 

Casualties 1,076,245 lest wiki.
So define deaths also wounded well “we”? 

For measure work, also need able eradicate virus within borders. Travel doesn’t matter much community presence already. 

Might work New Zealand, Iceland Australia. work USA, Spain Brazil. speech therapy can't home?

Is usually used child trouble speaking early stages? know history judge them.  Flu, like Covid, also heightens sorts risk factors like heart attack, stroke, organ failure, etc. Covid way dangerous.

A lot people *think* they've flu they've really bad cold. flu puts ass. killer. don’t work, least don’t work well enough anyone noticed. 

Let’s moment assume masks work. don’t mask wearing cultures better mortality rates previous flu seasons compared non-mask wearing cultures? 

Why look rt.live site tracks reproductive number see transmission change use required? 

There’s nothing special Influenza commonly circulating conronaviruses prevents masks reducing transmission well.

Did really think Europe, USA, decided look it? say, “nah, don’t think so”? course researched it. evidence said don’t work. sudden do? Let’s see science yet flips pandemic ends. highly doubt US public begin wear masks going forward.

I don’t know even bother. people minds made up. I’ll take loss, downvote want. don’t surprised following years countries suddenly realized masks work longer recommend upcoming flu seasons. America country lost citizens........as soon Americans notice world outside country, maybe lightbulb go off......but see happening anytime soon. 10 people house, one dies, mass death? worked. grew descendents. insular ignorant, romanticise ignorance.

True provable things less important pappy said, thing change viewpoints forced integrate due changing demographics.

Their absurd one drop definition whiteness makes cause futile one. I'll intent taken, actual honest question wonder would renounced ""being american"" not. joke agree, side vs side gets us fast.

This never end FBI receives credible information terrorist networks infiltrated US airports planted explosive devices 113 domestic flights detonated single day. plane ticket day. postpone flight?

Now suppose terrorists able 113 domestic flights every day year. Would change travel plans year? Would support government restricting air travel terrorist activity stopped? Odd orange one take magic pills push came shove it? dead Americans

...so far. yet. That's deadly

ain't right. find evidence would certainly something. Poor poor boomers Don’t forget Cold War too. Jesus fucking christ look reply comment hahahahahahahah holy shit redditors really like that's good. Think overpopulation moment. say legal citizens country. think time would exsplain cuff joke. clearity, commenter implying bunch idiots fighting get country meh state right meh slaves ""real Americans"" (which arguably). Idk... go hail-mary contesting election Supreme Court, one would think they'd contest results.

People voting presidential candidate, no? US population 1/3 now... OTOH, US involvement WW1 3 times long pandemic far. two variables least cancel out. everyone gets tested. Tokyo screwed what? Thanks responding. curiosity try things people mention around like Zinc, Vit sort stuff?  count. That's fair enough.  

I'm sure possible, it'd cool automod indicate word triggered automatic removal. way people guessing avoid reposting. That's usually delayed bit though, right loved article, thank source back up? Huh forgot America showed last year WW lmfao I'm trying outright disagree cause confrontation. can't move past absolve blame say ""oh us, them!..."" fought Americans face that. point, sorry make clear. Holy FUCK! fuck anyone stupid enough, 10 fucking months data contrary,to still think Covid like fucking flu. know pres moron, 40 million cult member stupid also.

Gnight friend made take way no, all. simply says. modern comparison people relate to. 'Half US ww2 deaths' easier get several wars combined, back. Economy issues concern FHM mandate. concern population health comes kids education important whole life. Skipping year young kid mean fixed studying one year, functions brain develop young years. Personally I'm open exploring available info. However, find article CNN Fox News, I'm going post that, bias. I'll try find similar article Reuters AP reliable. [Summit even extremely biased Fox CNN, there's first problem.

The second issue actual lockdown, hardly anywhere world, Declaration demanding “Those vulnerable immediately allowed resume life normal"" just...doesn't make ton sense. Maybe need fix language there...

Lastly I'd say ought go ahead read Declaration, also read it. [Things it. That's good practice. Shocked cynic?

Shocked moron. Austria 900+ new cases per day. death toll rising.

Tough situation there. really dislike comparisons. mean 2028 lost 80k influenza never saw articles 20 9/11's recent war deaths combined etc.

I wish would benchmark covid known diseases would apt comparison. Scientists: give logical reason something

World: ""mmm,nah"" That's... taking precautions LOL tried making argument guy believes chemtrails 300k 2020 100k 20201? would deaths go much next year? though vaccine would available end next year envy strong caught politics sir. Religion super spreader world wide. lab conspiracy theory debunked countless times. Asserting truth without even source going get downvoted.

Nice see, seems north/west part state different. one says mate. Absolutely one. virus back March/April, can't segment it. 52, he's Gen X idiot. boomer. right, that's kind context here, measures place, stricter lockdowns point almost eliminated it, cusp winter time, exploded, almost **doubling** previous records active cases. deaths also dramatic increase. first wave \~100 deaths, second, well almost 900

victoria southern part AUS, even though ""south Australia"" got cold weather faster rest us did, states bit extra warm weather eliminate it, didn't. 

the poor bastards like total 2 months without lockdown year, whereas state 2 months total. smashed flu, covid came back vengeance, live packed coastal cities, still population density America.

we also get anywhere near cold America does, can't imagine full-on American winter covid around like. feel need this? stupid backlash NBC harsh. Keep America out. Wait us get shit together. Could awhile... us understanding. rage nuclear football bad combination

Original post.

'Roid rage refers idea users Anabolic steroids experience extreme mood swings aggression result increase testosterone. 


Corticosteroids increase testosterone, they're used anti-inflammatories. So, referring stating they've caused ""roid rage"" stupid entirely inaccurate.

You could hardly call described above, side effect sometimes occurs small percentage administered, rage. sure ever seen anyone manic vs person raging...

I despise trump think he's absolute nutter, let's accurate description side effects drugs. basically sticking dipshit high school kid blurted ""IT'S ROID RAGE! Huurrr"". ...until did. China save world.

Thank you, China! I’m sitting urgent care right waiting get test. sucks, can’t believe people still saying it’s fake whatever. it, Hoss. stopped following OnA around 2014. One last things remember Gavin getting show Ants site showing like kilt talking “proud boy”. 

People also forget co-founded Vice. leftist magazine cool kids everywhere. hilarious bad bot paying attention. guess understand 200,000 deaths originally predicted good response considered failure. numbers India huge. 1,300,000,000 people ... per capita looks different though. Woah, settle there. serious. One last stretch goal left guys! it! atheists suffer Orthodox's irresponsible behavior? remember one. NettinYahoo supporters probably cases corona. mean people access wilderness start eat bushmeat? Start even bigger black market wild animal poaching? Disease carrying bats squirrels, zombie deer, add endangered species top off. somehow, president followers still care, ??? 215,000 people dead. fearmongering, literally happening. think China looking Taiwan. USA still 10th/270 terms death/1M people, that's really bad nation supposedly resources contacted health providers yesterday he’s legally required isolate 10 days now. He’s staying hotel Friday may stretch gets symptoms. may stay rest choice anymore. I’ll back starts wandering early go stay moms 10’days up. 

Thank responding Snopes, AP multiple fact checkers proved incorrect. Read thread title try keep up. Hey worry man, we'll topping WW2 soon enough. hang there! want flu numbers higher CoVID numbers say, China works hard Taiwan #1

Free Tibet 

Taiwan #1 FDA? thought politicians running shitshow. remote debates, transparency coaching better monitored... founders United States raised arms countrymen. time, Civil War seen second American Revolution. swear surreal stuff ever saw life. don’t think 400k trivial. It’s bad! definitely inconsistency regard find acceptable various contexts. lived China years, extremely skeptical anything say. listened Korea NZ though Ww2 took longer 6 months. Let's compare years drug it? can’t read full article? hey, nobody gives damn, take sarcasm 1million dead see laugh. Exactly. Here's thing, decisions affecting others. Therefore body.

Also, mask tyranny register car, number assigned you, required adhere laws state? Damn ""combined"" hit hard :/ youre ok 205k Americans dead high WW2 numbers? know got number CDC estimates 61,000 deaths bad year flu. years lot lower. year worst year since 2009 pandemic according CDC. It’s funny, remember OnA wasn’t giant white supremacy piece shit lover. piece shit lover back high blood pressure risk factor? virus, higher pressure, move faster faster around bodies blood tubulars, causing virus spawn endlessly?

Or people high blood pressure often shitty diets. people shitty diets probably bad hygiene. Leading corona cases. high pressure leads corona, ignorance that's leads high pressure corona.  Ok? That’s point. point cherry pick statistics anything make something look bad want. Sounds nice ""not vulnerable"" ""resume normal life"", proposing quarantine ""vulnerable""? Like 65+ people? obesity (like half US population)? predict disappear Easter. us practice defeatism. us realize quantity grade idiots outnumber functioning brains. reason many us would rather live April 2020 lifestyle perpetuity associate lack mental acumen functioning adults. Isn’t time another investigation it? enough congress actually cared something again, precautions vs without. Trump knows better. already forgotten Woodward tapes? God plan, etc  really confused headline, here's excerpt: 

""Foege, previously vocal critic the agency's handling novel coronavirus, called Redfield openly address the White House’s meddling agency’s efforts to manage COVID-19 crisis accept political sacrifice would follow. recommended Redfield commit writing administration's failures — — record could dismissed"" LMAO! Yeah must Trump desperately kept cutting every time Biden edge fact-checking fat lying ass.

No one buying shit. Give up. Damn like sitting disgusting chair room bunch assholes. See [There ‘scientific divide’ herd opinion piece response That's dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard. new definitions good bad moral equivalents:

Whatever stands Trump's way - bad.

Whatever gets wants - good. situation Austria covered much here. information share? According EO 20-244 cannot enforce penalties individuals.

Section 4. Suspension COVID-19-related Individual Fines Penalties
This order, consistent Executive Order 20-92, suspends collection fines and
penalties associated COVID-19 enforced upon individuals. guess don’t understand 2 million less deaths originally predicted considered failure. initially got bunch upvotes I'm -6 expressing opinion china lying, clearly work targetted votes. even get level downvotes saying something unpopular ps5s ps5 subreddit Nah, stopped telling people vegan. Every time people acted like stabbed dog. Sideways glances, whispers behind back like can't see three feet away, asking eat GMOs, asking get enough protein, acting like I'm going freak drop animal fat touches lips, asking ""I'm able find something eat"", genuinely concerned way. saying prefer eat animal products. much sarcasm judgment, people supposed friends family. simple ""okay"" would suffice. Yeah, half expected say ""by March 2021"" something. Enough cover 11 American football fields That's ignorant comment. know people worn masks since March Rep Dem. Yeah, dig economy No, usually means see people hurt. lifelong vegetarian, conversation duh moment. Please clap ‘drain swamp’ means? must anti-science idiots That's incredibly disheartening. I've reduced meat consumption, mostly environmental reasons, even max guess eating less typical American, time active 6'2"" 225lb dude...  is! small group friends (10) wants get together someone’s house watch church service (which involves singing- may last 20 mins), we’d house 2 hours. sounds like moderate high risk activity. Singing almost equivalent AGP, correct? surgical masks. ppl don’t wear them. TBH friends, bowed several group activities – trying walk line btwn friends/non-neurotic safety. plans setting foot inside church, dine-in restaurant soon. Peer pressure seems persuade people eventually. Surely, I’m concerned? HTN 1 risk factor. Relative HCP – okay, far. coworker went vent close lived, yeah…. I’m going guess wise answer – *do go* situation? tried think compromises, came blank (other wearing mask I'd gladly it). high risk activity? I’m betting reveals he’s infected debate make Harris consider dropping Republicans Yeah lol. I've since June completely fine since Surprisingly solid guidance. expecting admonitions celebrating Satan witches way protect satan/covid prayer, b/c know Arkansas. exception South Korea, seen decent stats actually transmitted.

CDCs governments around world tell people that, without explanation data back up.

Is eating saliva shower what? proximity? so, tell people wear masks work?

Virus transmission biggest issue world right now, perhaps would good idea get data. NHL deserves ton credit bubble. Playoffs went w/o hitch. 30,000 tests (daily). 

May helped two hub cities Canada (Toronto/Edmonton) they've done much much better job containing covid-19. feel isolated excluded family seem pretending whole thing isn’t happening. They’re monthly get togethers normal. It’s sad see pictures know watching babies grow distance everyone else doesn’t miss it. We’re firm resolve, doesn’t make easier alone it. agree trump could tried more, respecting states rights important thing constitutional republic. Even riots offered military support govornors denied it. tribalist state democrats blaming trump states policies. media focused republican states gave cuomo. Whitmer, govornor NJ pass. Republican states better democrat now. truly bekieve tanking economies ourpose upcominh election. else continue horrifc lockdowns onky state really needed kind restrictions NY vecause poorly handled covid pandemic.

Right democrats trying secure funding states instead securing money people effected lockdowns. Trump willing send money americans pelosi utterly ruining democrat party. trump criticised bunch sure ultimately coronavirus responses left state governments thank god montana shouldnt restrictions NY. Also riots specifically supported media democrat officials made democrat cities even worse hit poor people even more. 

There plenty republicans dont like cannot think democrats like time. either hyper polarized like AOC lifelong train wrecks like Pelosi, Schumer, schiff. Lifelong republicans better Mcconel, grahm, on. 

Finally think heading civil war mail ballots. one accept election results whoever wins instead trying prevent healthy people vote person risk people request absentee ballots want mass unsolicited mail voting point makes me.feel want either create chaos cheat. 

So far enticing conversation rarely havr people different opinions reddit. Obviously blm protests helped covid 19 spreading. Look coronavirus worldmeter data. lot redditors talking big game reddit probably actuality Redfield gets shit canned, know trump going appoint Atlas head CDC. Well, point zonked-er. likely evens Covid deaths place even counted. still need advanced degree, usually science engineering, want get job. Unless coming wealthy background want get illegally first figure later. 

He's jsckass right became harder ever. he's right better countries except few.

I see problem holding government certain standard, though. Certainly non-zero number people would died another cause now. core issue lockdowns. However, supposed say loud here. die COVID-19, die alone. Consume, silent, die. Europe vaccine discussion usually involves H1N1 vaccine Pandemrix. generally considered example ""vaccine gone wrong"". Sweden recommended Swedes get vaccinated, 6 Million Swedes did. later turned Pandemrix cause narcolepsy kids, 300 kids Sweden registered Pandemrix ""victims"".

So that's 300 6 million got narcolepsy exceptionally bad vaccine. 0.005%. Compare 0.1% die Covid. No, lets clear. They're okay 210k dead, would also like zero safety precautions number rise 9,282,440.44 deaths based current 2.8% mortality rate US. far worse caring dead, concern still living. conscripted. Eh hoser, probably burped poutine! Oh man hear ya there. work semi conduct industry sit front $3000+ dollar box constant registers exact content air. 5 years work mask inside air sealed bunny suit 12 hours day working inside $150+ million dollar tool. honestly fun see people's reactions describe them, painful detail, wrong are. implore show billion/trillion dollar industry work done less research Jimbo facebook. 

The argument usually details something entirely different point. citizens attended, politicians. NJ outbreak hand result Ah. see kind covid poster are. 

There's nothing solid mass reinfections yet. We'll keep waiting. Who? shit. quarantining Yeah... want get 51 blues senate. Fuck mitch mitch like 97% chances win. Let's focus probable scenarios. Sorry - point. 'Trump spreading' comments going political. Aye. Ouch. Lmao yeah. quite incredible see attitude changing swiftly sub. seem amenable anti-lockdown attitudes lot voices sub quite distanced people live reality think Looking Actual requirements, descriptive, says 

""Data Phase 3 studies includes median follow-up duration least two months completion full vaccination regimen help provide adequate information assess vaccine’s benefit-risk profile,""

And that's says, I'm wondering many people second round Vaccine 2 months.

If Pfizer started Phase 3 Trial late July, means people would get 2nd dose end August, 2 months end October. Aka election.

So dont see wouldnt allow pfizer apply then. Testing lonesome work well. like plopping smoke detectors calling day, ignoring fire walls, fire doors, fire extinguishers, evacuation plans etc, coming fire safety plan building.  things work concert maximize safety, insufficient. Nah. mcconnell fish-related burns mean... private schools county running months, schools county nearby quarantining subsets students bringing kids back appropriate. really harmful kids loved ones, despite reaction closing everything one positive case. ""None me"" Case point: medical staffs blame ALL!   White House event. NJ event. please consider separate post Probably due Europe entire continent opposed one country It’s fine though. gotta keep believing wotsit \*laughs Canadian\* would suitable Trump megathread. Please feel free repost there. saying 100% correct.

The CFR characteristic pathogen, ability measure it. describing virus itself, IFR needs used. don’t mean trivialize it, number able bodied young men women killed disease? always thought made war deaths particularly tragic. Well yes, speculate data. reasonably estimate currently number cases peak. Rolling 7day average 650/day 1000 3 months. down, still quite high. covids current 2.8% mortality rate ran entire population changing would kill 9,282,440.44 people. Would love idiots explain nine million lives insignificant. trying punish everyone America? I'm starting think Jesus Holy Spirit good prophylactic Covid. Lmao idk hilarious agree eating restaurants bad idea. case study correlation sure. People eat restaurants pandemic non safe things, like going parties family gatherings. actually knew contracted it, I’d bet uncle Billy’s house family reunion instead dinner Outback. pretty good insurance, cover helicopter rides!!!!! ruled certain party freedumb lovers.... Stop donating her...I think i've writing 50 times past year.

1. flush cash point getting horrible ROI new spending

2. There's 10 Senate races likely flip one



There's many races need cash... Could agree more. amazing rocker people sub compared drive 35 minutes city talk people hang out. Worked guy June. Ruined health broke financially. heard since Oct 2nd. So...we talking walk balcony then? Because....no one within like 100 feet him. closest people flight stairs, away balcony, OUTSIDE I've discovered D&amp;D though, that's neat.

Tabletop gaming amazing! player DMing? like best it? love acting scenes putting funny voices. many US civilians killed mentioned wars? “We ShOuLdN’T ScArEd CoViD” Poor Robert E Lee getting caught b.s . aware that, although post clear discount paint scenario happened, 
I mentioned least piece post, bad. trying make point Jewish sympathizer Nazi regime could've woken day sudden change Jews treated could've tried acted ignore it, opposed Southerners taught since day born things always been. making excuses, two different situations. Woah, republicans, trump, democrats. 

Let’s bring discussion topic please. Weird long ago know America worlds largest surveillance system, worlds brutalest law enforcement. beacon democratic world. He's sick infectious, people around him. mask times. WTF difficult understand. Look LA data protest onset. Obviously crowded events give boost covid spreading, easily look protester onset data.... wondering, prior Covid, someone weak immune system died pneumonia sick flu official cause death pneumonia flu? tests? Time let federal state take BAG decide do. rocket science, nearly beat first wave, before. course, need think longer term plan, includes financial aids people businesses. many people civilly discussing corona, folks like come argue rabble-rouse really stick like sore thumb. chill lol. short, almost 4500 new cases yesterday, 840 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants - highest Europe. sat un middle circle people tested positive Rose Garden Massacre. Almost every single person high school immigrated USA country Master's Degree. make job market yes, true. People want go US still offers much advanced quality education (at least university level). 

You might reasons hate country even today still better huge portion world. superpower world's largest economy, standards expected meet global stage significantly higher countries. Even states mandate mask use, outside cities lot places still dont require masks, Employees dont wear masks, etc. wouldn’t say much shorter. antebellum south truly barbaric society reveled cruelty.

Some worst crimes Nazi Germany direct parallels Antebellum South, confederacy, practices involved slavery particular. 

Doctors South experimented enslaved people order perfect medical techniques surgeries. use anesthetic even forms available seen wasteful since black skin said feel less pain white skin. 

A popular form punishment slaves caught organizing escape rebellion lynch outside quarters. bodies left hang rot, families allowed take bury bones picked clean. 

Slaves involved revolts impaled pikes sat fields along walk paths terroristic reminder slaves. 

Slaves generally malnourished sickly due poor nutrition ragged living conditions. 

Slaves transported around like cattle en masse. 

Slaves routinely brutalized, raped, maimed, tortured, murdered, parts bodies amputated forms punishment even small offenses enslavers. there's pandemic people gathering. Yes, certainly been.

Oh, forgot. multiple-choice exams country. 🤣🤣 sure point - lockdowns work principle? lockdowns cannot work practice, anywhere, people selfish? 

To clear, points are: lockdowns work; and: selfish (and partisan) behavior large minority Americans worked US. 

I know explain Peru. suspect lockdowns particularly ""harsh"". case, country US compared. better pretty much anyone, certainly better say Germany, population density public transport use much higher. Maybe Australia would good benchmark aim at. War Drugs. 

Oh wait... It'll easy. quick background check would screw over. Exactly. pure animalistic thinking- increase tribe vs tribe, carry genes, etc etc, world's problem humans. ReAl!

STAY WOKE ... still catch it, geniuses would report to? skeptical defending govt think govt wanted suppress numbers PR, would never allowed go beyond highest daily cases record set US. crossed that, realized, catch. is. ground reality may bit harsh reported numbers huge margin. Yes many years life taken. seen stats saying average person died CV19 less year live anyway. vietnam killed 55,000 average 60 yrs live equals 3.3 mill years life destroyed. CV killed 200,000 1 year life left equals 200,000 years life destroyed. 

CV19 terrible thing lose productive life insignificant compared vietnam. Nothing remotely close 0.1% could feasibly get normal phase 3 trials that, front-running vaccines, currently scheduled conclude month high efficacy. Supposedly likely delay things late October earliest [""around November 24-25 Pfizer/Moderna looks like FDA sacrificed tens thousands lives (along unknown number permanently damaged people economic impacts) virus exchange avoiding potential risk hundreds lives. like trolley problem, key difference people making decisions know might held responsible happens switch trolley tracks, thus far concerned people potentially hidden distance track thousands people getting run right now. Australia maybe fukt

i astounded Dem primary voters chose ONE GUY similar Trump. I'd say humanity general get idea reminder: covid 19 killed people people dead wars, americans lost wars. hope I'm pedantic think important remember killed probably around 5 civilians every soldier lost iraq. Add Trump list. go play videogame called Plague inc. Hiroshima Nagasaki 250k 300k population time. Hiroshima militarily important Nagasaki industrially important.

Little Boy (Hiroshima) much smaller detonated higher, concentrating power instead out. Meanwhile, Fat Man (Nagasaki) missed bit detonated valley, shielding much rest city.  evidence would scale today’s deaths FDA really well respected, would ban antipsychotics. antipsychotics even legal? Brain shrinkage terrible ""side"" effects without even knowing action mechanism.... think caught it? 50 Preventable 9/11s Trump far (this minus 60,000 per considered reasonable given strong response good leadership). Try telling family, fortunate baby one died great state ours.

??? Obviously sucks family bad outcome fortunate babies suffer fate. trying say dead babies would make feel better dead baby?  think caring vulnerable ever serious consideration government. fooling yourself. 

The government wants work, work hard, die. 

Are people want whats best others? Sure. vast vast majority people want whats best themselves. Outside loved ones, generally care others either. 

Although I'm starting see articles lockdowns causing major famine death 3rd world countries too, suppose point, already, figuring suitable death. head doctor fauci screwed us said masks ineffective could horde government agents. New york Michigan New Jersey bad sent covid positive patients nursing homes killing many seniors. Nope, war fought Americans Americans. don’t get change matter many upvotes get sounds truly horrifying. Holy shit. I’ve 4 years medical hell various chronic &amp; acute illnesses (feelin good past 9 months, go figure)  Jesus Christ really like prediction. hope accurate. haven’t really reports people getting bad symptoms worse symptoms- test positive it’s generally asymptomatic. said, still wear mask keep distance others wash hands, etc. certainly don’t want get spreader. really should

 Lol, cities destroyed ffs. Turn Fox News. hot take Lincoln free slaves Nice normally would shut hell up, blaming me, RN, colleagues got full attention. Take us task? Failures? hell even mean?

With due respect (to currently 0%), never make single appointment doctor again. Never go hospital ailments. call 911 medical emergency. audacity blame us, time need want us? No. Absolutely not. Figure yourself. Treat yourself. Fix yourself. 

You think god damned easy us point blame us, suggest taken task failures means dont need us. god damn own, guy.

----Wayne Gretzky
------Michael Scott chu saying african americans traitors? Sugar fine dont care decide eat personal choice. amount sugar eat effect me. Drunk driving crime endangering others. Similarly wearing mask crime come similar harsh consequences.

We shut things dumb Americans killing Americans. TIME UBI USA. Telling people church, funerals, yet politicians marching thousands.

My uncle always us. dad working weekends due Desert Storm, would take us breakfast. needed someone patience expertise driving cars (he raced cars), taught us drive (like Mr. Myagi Karate Kid). 

My dad sick COPD, COVID, always coming taking care him.

But - yup - he's redhat through, racist likes use N-word (hard R) understands gravity COVID knows would horrible death father. best offer back perspective love needs understand world way treats like bigger place 7000-person-all-white-town lives (and grew in).

Hate sin, sinner. want declare bills roll  I'm fortunate live state (not USA) full shutdown, eliminated covid barely handful deaths bounced back economically internal state tourism booming. Fast full elimination definitely right choice.   
    
The alternatives (suppression via inconsistent lockdowns, prevention all) clearly darkest timeline. Highest body count social impact :/ I'll always wonder madcap bid try king America institute prima nocta name repopulation. know thinking far ahead I'll wonder. Cool obesity. dumbest thing ever heard. wars combined lasted multiple decades. COVID around 10 months. Herd immunity working there, better every day Brazil right now. difference getting sneezed getting stabbed.

Our response SUCKED both. IMO comparison two disservice lost either.

I add, I'm drunk tho sry. You’re forgetting mention protests cause appreciable uptick covid cases. sarcasm? I'm confused. limit spread, students exist fucking vacuum. jfc

Ftfy regulations FDA globally harmonized. Meaning MHRA UK, Health Canada Canada, TGA Australia, MHLW Japan, CFDA China, KFDA Korea, etc. etc. requirements homogenized across countries. Weakening US regulations impact them. Mostly regulatory quality teams manufacturing organizations accustomed meeting regulations simultaneously, instead picking regulations apply markets manufacturing.

This even threat WH can't impact global regulations, federal ones. WH seem understand international regulations. mcdonald's north korea think would ever want live there. likely

First, hard lockdowns.

Second, BANNED international travel 2022.

We need ban international travel that's virus spreads various parts world. lots things kill others way negligence. People drive drunk texting kill people time ones talking families. virus comes along kills 200,000 people (half 80) shut everything slap masks. really difference see media focusing Covid ignoring thinks like Heart Disease America's addiction sugar. I'm saying virus bad, things. response? now? Could deeper motivating factors? mean viruses since beginning time. come go kill people along way. nature acting like nature means end world, acting like is? Take best care health. That's do. hear that. People ordering fast food hitting liquor store masks on. must like slow death quick, outcomes same. First all: fatness kill grandma sneeze direction. Obesity contagious. Covid obesity cannot compared honestly.

Second: push social climate bring end big tobacco make healthier food options affordable quite time now.

I admire bringing forth issues plague nation, post perfect example red herring fallacy. get make distinction. Happy Cake Day!  stopped discussion point effectively relevant. relevant candidates supported didn't, anyone votes Trump Biden support universal healthcare ignorant damage Trump trying bring healthcare anyways.

It's still common talking point, relevant post election. ""While company calls closures temporary, name date possible resumption business, saying continue monitor situation closely.""

Hopefully they'll able open spring summer. miss going see movie. stresses since love going movies back home.

Yet Japan's theatres hanging on. Wut mass hysteria, plain simple hard fuck-up president. BS. 

Lightning kills average 51 people per year US per NOOA estimates. far 60 Americans 16 died COVID per CDC.  That's 50% deaths time report made.

Most=Majority
50%+ = Majority Yeah, proud heritage like descended abolitionist New England Republicans.

Fine, ancestors *maybe* fight slavery. Mine sure hell fought it.  Take flag stuff it.  new domestic case, 

I envy China much.

Their death toll climbing either far know. 5,000. That's marvelous achievement. Went restaurant back early June open wore mask time sitting talking. one people looked funny don’t see harm. take seriously enough take precautions get though, wants grandstand That's different. U.S Gov't wised back mandated masks, period. We'll fine. /s  Woah, we're half way 
Woah, livin' prayer deaths mostly young people tho honestly find hard believe McDonald's... two degrees. I’m American history country’s participation war isn’t huge part curriculum.

Didnt seem work lied obesity, cigarettes, etc. that, United States actually sympathetic Ho Chi Min, pro-American initially, literally owed life OSS agents air-dropped WW2 saved life medical emergency. French basically blackmailed United States supporting threatening leave NATO completely either join non-aligned movement start own, suspiciously Soviet-friendly power block.

In short, fuck Charles de Gaulle say 40-60% less infection, says fewer doctor visits. flu less severe flu shot still catch it. demonstrations 7 city blocks big town ~2k city blocks.

SMH. Well since excess deaths line fairly well reported deaths, makes sense trust numbers. seem accurate. Yes they’re reputable, they’re actually local (to me)! They’re IT/office supply company got PPE offices due covid, also sell consumers. owner actually chartering jets full masks PPE straight factories, thus price. websites it’s helpful use stock alerts allow them.

So shutting country cases covid good strategy, keeping country open pandemic guidelines good strategy lot cases covid? 

Is saying? Look excess mortality. lines pretty well reported deaths, unlike lot countries. increase cases, mostly young people infected, really deaths (yet). Either way, people die right getting infected. understand point is, since European countries seeing thing? Thanks. few, almost one running president People dickride New Zealand vilify China.

This costing countries stupid amounts money, absolutely to. Comparing tends derail pointless number measuring contest anyways, think things learn pretty much (good, bad and/or surprises included) responses experiences. probably advising designing pandemic responses, much reddit commentators.

Ok, preconcieved prediction done, shall watch video. :)

Edit, watch: way shallow sounded partly like advertisement. recent increase slight, agreeable worrying though . point someone 40 years experience wrong frequently. knew banning flights China wise mid-January, misinformed? know HCQ available without prescription, what's excuse?  fully agree everything say, talking much recent terms. US citizen, grew Eastern Europe, I've seen practice solid education turned intentionally upside 80s 90s case, led total catastrophe politically, things happening believe. (well 2020 least).

Meanwhile hospital didn’t get Reimbursed funds thought would covid. lost 400 million dollars month peak. much loss I’m 100% sure none us getting bonus year. short staffed since. faking positive result.

It’s insulting. much ass eat though fact US slavery puts within global historic norms.  legacy European slave traders bringing here, African slavers capturing selling them.  took us 70 years get rid US formed. seems pretty fast, me, retrospect. suppose difference normal illnesses covid latter could prevented entirely right political moves. often political stances clearly quantifiable consequences. since AIDS perhaps.    
     
Of course, things like lung disease somewhat tied political decisions, difficult tease many direct result single party's bad health enviornmental policy. comparison H1N1 would interesting, anyhow. news standard issue coming Sinopharm themselves, nothing exiciting.

UNICEF procurement however comes handy interactive chart, fun fiddle around look various statistics. know successful China 2-3 weeks holidays see many new infections emerge,” Thomas said. “If manage avoid upsurge cases, evidence China truly moving post-Covid period.”

Exactly worries May holiday. localized outbreaks scattered cases happened traced illegal border crossings cold chain imports. much different time. r/ShermanPosting Yeah, many soldiers asthma diabetes? Can’t say died bullet head one those. Yeah, that's limit kind comparison numbers post stories parents losing healthy children pleading public wear masks. story somehow determine entirety disease. many people American society reacting much differently, we're choosing ignore them. plenty ways get majority degenerates wear mask.

For example, could arrest refused follow guidelines. increase taxes criminals owe fuckton make last long time. Depending much make could tax shit years years. take money use pay healthcare costs effected stimulus. 

Hillary certainly wouldnt done this, solutions exist. almost literally predicted said covid left hospital verbatim. page says reduces flu illness 40 60%

How result saving 3500 lives?

Logic: kind important Oh I’m sorry. thought names people possibly infected—like Giuliani, Barr, Pence virus killing fat, old, malnourished people.

That's Nazi shit bro. What’s average age who’ve succumbed Covid vs ones lost lives Nam ?

You know I’m going answer question.

The average age death US Covid -19 75 years old .

I’m Vietnam wear average age death 22 . No, evidence supposed criticism CCP? Gosh!

Even replacing 1 meal day omlet grilled chicken salad start making huge improvement life. It’s really crazy textbook wave are, exact thing happened continue happening states. Cases drop, people usually young say fuck go out, get sick infect older people. yet nothing done prevent it, it’s nuts. I'm starting think wants cabinet position Trump administration. Yep, I'm going limit life people want think there's microchips vaccine. go day around Seattle. seen anything would prevent so, everyone incredibly mindful masks social distancing. That's probably it. Cancer Warrior means someone battles Cancer keeps fighting. Yeah, tbh that's long, deaths due poor economy deaths due virus may end matching. Bro really say 10% Americans dying acceptable straight face  *[Dick Cheney entered chat]* deeply sorry lack cultural understanding. Please accept apologies. That's like saying got civil war now, West vs East, one side longer ""Americans"". side seceding side, would fly coast fight vs home people?

Each soldier fought died, fought protect land. like now, soldiers fighting brothers left right them. infantryman thinking oil fields. Leadership different, say 100K traitors died slaves reach.

Note birth America ""betraying"" England. Nice job missing half sentence thereby completely changing meaning. Perhaps could journalist too!

The US low score *for virus response*, China lowest *overall* score. worries, still got time presentation that's wildly atypical COVID, tested negative twice, think COVID why? also think AIDS? presentation wildly atypical AIDS too, I'm sure would also test negative twice it. plaque psoriasis? 

The reason think COVID disease people mention COVID non-stop days mention disease frequency.  Yes, better way putting it. fact 20 year old dying pandemic makes news tells thing two pandemic. ""in action"" count injuries fighting? Infection, surgery mortality etc? average, 32% people Confederacy owned slaves. states, figure higher (Mississippi 49%, South Carolina 46%)
Based 1860 link study. web page evidence claim. 

The study may well flawed least it’s well sourced purposely ignoring i'm saying. viruses like flu coronavirus, need enter body. skin make get unless there's open wound. pro-vaccine. want properly vetted vaccine planned wide distribution. don’t think that’s much ask makes anti-vaxxer (though seem imply that). concerns corners could cut scale-up manufacturing too, pretty much unprecedented, I’m sure get around that. pigs win  says vaccination prevents 3,500 deaths year. no, many. argument really looked trying. nothing? handing votes, smaller states wouldn’t matter popular vote? population states wouldn’t contribute balance red vs blue simply size? How? vote?

When twist turn lines districts order make one county (using Missouri St. Louis, higher population density compared rest state example) represent rest state combined, that’s fair? “People closely packed 1/100th state, plenty people live elsewhere state, don’t matter.” don’t follow.

Perhaps using states blankets swaying one way isn’t best way anymore.

Using actual votes people, vote want, advertise selling point rest world, makes lot sense. keep current system, people could vote mostly one way, one candidate wins, population density says don’t. win, don’t. Doesn’t sound like fair process. Kushy gig. Maybe poster believes normal behavior US. Totally misleading comment. ranked worse *a different question* survey.

China worst overall perception, whereas US seen worst virus response. 79,400 deaths flu 2017-18 flu season. say Corona taken seriously, perspective like one Vietnam Iraq every year regular flu.  dumb comparison though. America's stupidity selfishness killed ... FTFY killed flu buddy. Let's talk matters ...did think different?

The issue US people understand drugs work. assume vaccines dangerous side effects really common. They're not. Phase 1 drugs/vaccines extreme side effects either. However, even produces 1/100th side effects seen disease it'll probably get pulled. That's stringent are. There's vaccine candidate that's going even remotely close disease itself, even speed phase 2. leave Pig War 1859.   COVID represents 1.88% annual worldwide deaths. probably reach 2%.  feel like they're pretty accurate.

May well throw [Michigan-Ohio we're it... specifically targeted Chinese nationals. That's called out. banning say canadian passengers flying China LA toVancouver. allowed. 

That's people called racist. racist. Meanwhile conservative subs, ""No one made work it, slaves!"" mink meat used pet food. Except isn't. No, stop, need bullshit. fking thing, stuff like this, give ammunition skeptics permission spread disinfo. lol sad person ""I want anybody shake hands anyone else hate I'm pathetic!"" distinctly remember watching movie friend's family, hearing dad burst final scene, ""We gotta hear fuckin song again?!"" name anything else outside moment exclaim **was** climax beaten death song throughout film. Holy fuck, would surprised. Almost everyone know going Halloween parties now. 

A lockdown coming, gotta enjoy freedom it. 1 favorite days sleep in, lol People can’t grasp exponential increase cases. don’t understand. Based what? Honestly, might hot take, literally make wanna secede Northeast maybe California. honestly think might better way think there's way reconcile two separate highly polarized sides. Big numbers hard visualize, get mixed mushes together mind. 210608  ÷  2977 = 70,75 

&amp;#x200B;

So like 9/11 happened everyday 71 days straight. That's lot trade centers planes Good. Maybe stores still business. Twitter still says he’s fine. Almost every day since april, COVID leas #3 killer America. days ranked #1. people stupid think protesting contribute covid spread. would literally make sense to. Even everyone wore masks, 100% foolproof (doesn't mean wear though) least someone would get it. Way completely misinterpret said name call. Reminds 12.

What said was, sick general. Then, able see family made conditon worse..then caught covid final straw. 

Did really quote quote didnt actually write, word try make look dumb lmao....and people wonder noone takes anything say seriously. Change manipulate everything name call SOMEHOW mind, im wrong youre right....What planet lmao lasting immunity coronaviruses. many times explained?

You mean besides SARs-COV-1? shown antibodies 17 years fact? Pretty sure 'coronavirus'. still fully know know quite time. can't 'explained' confirmed. we're near definitive answer yet. longer people wipe asses health recommendations medical professionals, longer take. Here's latest case/death charts Kentucky, running 7-day Kentucky's per capita deaths relatively low, 27.93 per 100k population. 7-day trends look great. 

Kentucky ranks 37th per capita “He always winced pain breathes.”-Probably Trump’s doctor wonder non-gamers coping it, feel like 3 months passed   time period, 10 times people died heart disease, cancer, diabetes2, stroke, etc. fuck even said.................. like telling teenagers sex 100% baby get STD. realistic going happen. educate safe sex reduce/mitigate chances becoming pregnant contracting STD.

Yes, case condom ***MASK***, people essentially saying exempt wearing condom ""medical condition"".

And guess what... ones pushing ""abstinence only"" education ones refusing wear masks.

How long lasts follows normal(ish) distribution. initial reinfections picked left-hand tail distribution. 

And abundant absolute numbers, also rare terms rigorous confirmation (because samples stored infections sequencing). 

Thus far everything fact consistent expected CCCs absence lasting immunity.

Iran place watch got hit hard early (already January, concealed several weeks) never brought infections down. 

Nobody else got hit hard within 3-4 months that. 

New York place 25% attack rate, kept cases since then, opportunity reinfections. 

The places got hit even harder Iran Latin America hit starting May, i.e. 4-5 months most, i.e. enough time seeing another massive wave also includes lots reinfections. 

Iran place right would expecting see reinfections large numbers, indeed reporting.

Unfortunately, source people taking seriously, think grave mistake.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Health Ministry said Monday nearly whole country coronavirus red alert cases deaths rose record levels, member state task force's warning field hospitals might needed people flout rules.

Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari told state television 26 Iran's 31 provinces ""red"" zones, highest alert level, four next ""orange"" level.

Authorities registered record high 3,902 new cases past 24 hours, total number identified cases worst-hit country Middle East rising 475,674, Lari said.

She said 235 patients died past 24 hours, equalling daily death toll high set July 28, bringing total death toll 27,192.

Officials complained many defied regulations wear face masks families used lockdowns go trips, helping spread virus hospitals nearly full.

""If people keep going weekend trips..., patients might go field hospitals,"" Masoud Mardani, member state coronavirus task force, told Khabaronline website.

On Saturday, schools, libraries, mosques public institutions capital Tehran closed week part measures stem rapid rise COVID-19 cases.

Similar closures also imposed Zanjan province, northwest Tehan, cities several provinces, shutting museums, theatres, gyms, cafes hair salons, state media said.

lol, many people warned careful playing math might hurt themselves, don’t use them. No, didn't. took less three months first time around

We first became officially virus free (14 days community transmission) 8th june kept status 3 months (caps dramatic newlines make something true), - unfortunately - let (we still know - may frozen food shipment). virus free second time (it took us roughly 7 weeks much less aggressive strategy). fully expect get back knock back again, long remains necessary so.

English, motherfucker! speak it? probably politically motivated push approval election. risk vaccine negative side effects develop first month 2nd month low. hey, fuck people dying. Gotta make sure Trump loses. Right?  thing stopping pandemic dead track please say *but new Zealand* Yeah, turns super obvious people (and that's okay, one knows everything). kinda acting like one people 🤷 200k dead corona europe.  Still technically correct though, especially compared rest world. mean gives shit guy thinks, CV19 expert? Sorry it’s not. last years every time I’ve taken trans Atlantic flight I’ve really sick needed Treatment ER I’m asthmatic.

Covid 19 shown us crowded areas, viruses spread. wearing simple thing mask protects others don’t see issue here?
It’s actually best way go stop masses people getting sick flu seasons helps economies benefits everyone levels society. 
It also means fewer hospital admissions lessens burden health systems. gundams they've building original plan easier lot people realise without Covid, around 70% death certificates list second cause death. norm. Covid exception. referring 1918 -1920 episode Wow you’re negative Nancy. information simply asking quick tests giving high frequency false negatives, assuming Covid.

And information, three people work close proximity tested positive Covid, scheduled take another asshole. good. 

It's definitely political. completely shown cracks government everywhere. wake call people, almost everywhere, last 50 years, Western world enjoying life unharmed.

Rocking boat something want do. That's changes masks, social distancing, whatever hard people deal with.

Don't even bother adding social media issue making people feel always missing out, able see news around world instantly. open Sweden look like gods, additional lockdowns Europe look awful.

I answers this. like numbers. tangible. make sense them. 30 year old bar owner wants open makes sense see people die 80. 

Are things related? knows. go on. I'm expecting additional transparency government agencies around world. Good job trump looks like projecting much loser calling soldiers losers.

Well glad put behind us. Open bars know people died Covid nowhere near numbers reported. Covid gets blamed way often. hoax, theres extra amount people dying year previous years. numbers get moved around. Vaccines early year. know long vaccines effective? Let's say vaccine effective three months, get soon available. Three months later, going need again, except time select received early line, everyone else well. make logistically difficult prepare obtain vaccine? Instead Joo Dee John Doe  People need large social interactions, Spanish flu People still events wore masks. absolutely need concerts large social events soon People definitely say fuck it. even go large events feel fact can't impacting life. Also musicians make money albums anymore, good artists mainstream die without it. country then? Even American, part stressed much education. born '74 remember ended '73 that. also always knew Kennedy president war assassinated '63, that's got decade figure from. realize longer watched documentaries it. Still, Wikipedia article revelation actually 1955 war started. Ok, let facts disrupt We're approaching 72 9/11's Trump roughly 8 months. start spending trillions healthcare war Covid-19??  Didn’t president? Americans 

Renounce government leaders. 
Renounce constitution. 
Take arms Americans war.

Edit: wholesome award? Lol admit public ultimately blame put MDs pedestals refuse take responsibility health. 90% preexisting conditions /s many historical deaths flu? neck mask? start insurance industry. Covid 19 vaccines built mRNA technology. Many front runners use non replicating viral vector protein sub unit platforms around long time.

The AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate set rolling review Canada EU utilizes adenovirus vector well understood established safety record. Definitely, 80 year old dying isn’t great, it’s COVID it’s gonna something else near future nearly every first world country handling much better? ones unbiased? want post someone's [well written opinion letter his/her thoughts recent presidential people gets killed police cause riots, made america bombs kills many times best angry internet posts written.

Edit: I'm unfair, many people die school shooting nothing happen well. good supervillain's lair though. enough piranhas, sharks, lava.  Wow, really neat! Thank you!   density Swedish metros Us metros relatively similar, less dense many metros Asian countries. logical fallacy densities; density distancing go hand hand. correlate bit, yes, culture plays much larger role.

Probably, executive control purse strings. America fundamentally broken country. cares comparing death rate. said total deaths. 200,000 people dying lot people. apologies (I admit didn’t read article don’t know says)  countries making home made masks. OP implying US’s hands clean don’t consider Confederates Americans, point would well taken. don’t see reason make assumption. don’t think Confederates Americans. also don’t think really changes anything American culpability. means traitors forfeit label, regardless legal status know Thalidomide's prescribed US now? women chance getting pregnant. 27% majority.

Well, we’ve known start health care workers microwaving masks kill covid. Republican filth. Yep drank party’s Kool-aid. doubt best state union, Wisconsin leading way!!!

Additional good  

#Packers 4-0, Wisconsin #1 covid-19!!! shame many republicans recover law recommendation? Giuliani still coughing lung testing negative yeah right!

Oh meddling people point don’t care whether get risk pretty obvious Better get used it. Again, fabricated ideas one China accepted. see mislead false information, US bombed Japan make entitled territories occupied. US actually little China completely different region. Thats funded KMT screwed Chiang kept money lost fight mere peasants. probably would make much change volume right wing, racist theories spurts though. 2008 Swine Flu believed started pig farm North Carolina Nice, thanks link :) Trump's fear live life plan. /s stomach still cut band placed. Yes. 11 bigger number 5. literally fighting become separate country failed. say Americans say lost. seems like there's bit correlation: 

*""When cell exposed foreign pathogen, extends signalling device 'antenna' known vitamin receptor, searches vitamin D,"", inadequate vitamin level, ""they even begin mobilize."" words, adequate vitamin critically important activation T-cells inactive naïve state. question whether T-cells might also need continuing supply vitamin prevent T-cell exhaustion apoptosis observed serious COVID-19 cases [9] deserves research.""*

[7th paragraph I'm saying, least give trial chance? Feels bizarre efforts going simultaneous vaccine trials. Kind like eggs one basket... current active cases 133 per 100k math right. big stadium again? got test walk clinic CA today. said 4-6 days. Also think people wear masks generally also respective things like social distancing hand washing Australia pretty big... administration give shit health. They're happy put risk benefits personally. buying plant-based alternatives.

I make “eggs” tofu, example. Tastes practically like real thing, without stench sulfur, phenomenally cheaper. don’t chicken eggs. think it’s rhetoric. People expressing shame discomfort posture American nation. don’t think actually wanted set international policy... worries. Wisconsinite sucks right now. mandate enforced, people behaving recklessly, government helping. Governor Evers trying, legislature joke. mean Christie technically public official. still active NJ governor, suspect governor's office medical team would providing occasional medical updates. Right now, he's private citizen, right know anything condition.

I agree way Trump's medical team trying spin things, think White House obligation share medical info public, since Trump sitting POTUS. Nope. gets voted out, pave way smooth transition, wish Biden luck leave, since MAN. accounts, even use BSL -3 labs research. BSL - 2 CoVs except sars mers. Created recombinant viruses minimum protection, made infective/airborne etc etc. 

Have read Eco Health grant statements? Seems like Wuhan lab gain function research US first place. I'm troll.

I'm excellent shape afraid.

Mental health matters too! Herman Cain died. Nutcases like blood 200k Americans hands clumsy. 
But American president done belittle, deny virus' importance real enough. 
How many people drunk bleach, believing cure preventative COVID-19? Especially realizing Covid-19 aerosol, I’ve wondered I’m covering enough. I’m thinking adding knit hat long sleeves pants shields. We’ve started taking masks washing faces get home, removing clothes washing shoes. saw photo guy wearing N95 mask and, drywalling fine dust creeps mask.

Edit add: drywall dust mask I’ve never heard before. What’s benefit? Reddit say, “ratfuckery.” :( fake news, come on! Chris Christie ""kill guy bridge"" quit spreading nonsense. woman. Chris Christie killed woman bridge, fat dog tick asshole, jail. Family China report life pretty much normal, Golden Week week - lots travelling, though quite much previous years. Mask still mandatory indoor public spaces. 

I know much China testing, last two domestic cases Qingdao discovered routine screening workers, would expect China testing non-healthcare care staff every two weeks, case detection rate pretty high. found new domestic case several weeks. given aggressively contact tracing every time new domestic case pops up, publishing movements new cases past days testing/isolating thousands contacts, see hide numbers. Yes China good exemple, guess like dictatorships. ""If leave home, vanish you."" course worked dictatorship.

Is right? I'll vanished leave home? police also shoot site? could've sworn able go every single day. fact, seems lockdown shorter less draconian yours. Oh wait, thinking Wuhan people allowed go outside. think applied entire country? enjoy Freedumb we'll enjoy vacation. Got it? wonder usually wide-eyed expression photos chose one looks surprised, fit article.

Sorry family but...yeah. Looks like literally takes deniers. Right, think many Americans expected summer. Fauci said March/April though sees resurgence fall periods locking reopening. government whole never made clear though said would go away warm weather. fucking sad. No, sorry. poor first world countries would well comparatively countries, think underestimate fast humans acclimate conditions. rich, would change nothing terms divides us, would consider condition ""average"", Seconded. brutal case deadly ignorance stupidity running rampant large portion population. comfortable time. Keep culture intact. Fine 64,900. I'll bet least half die. unbelievable. I'm literally shaking. RIP Florida. agree put Chick Fil order taker outfits? would make amusing. Mmmm victim blaming 2020 takes Chris Pratt us, help me. saying like it, I'll take whatever wins get. ever done Spanish flu? H1N1? China's already contributing aid free tons countries. would banishing Olympics accomplish?

How wrong eat dogs?

Are fearful another culture? ""So … vote now? H-how even..."" Good News /s END WELL fat old motherfuckers cannot possibly perfectly fine this. Especially politics, would dangerous anti mask lunatics stop murdering people Oh gotcha, thought NY. 

And disagree New York getting record number cases means statement wrong. don’t know many daily cases NY recording back early spring didn’t enough testing. positivity rate back insanely high tests given severe cases. 

They may recorded record number cases, positivity rate 1.2% extremely important. Remember dumb thing president said “more tests cases”. Sure using bad way attempting downplay virus, isn’t I’m doing, different angle, it’s true. said “more tests cases” good thing meaning cases identify better reduce community transmission. tests good thing. 

But widespread testing, positive percentage rate matters shows much spread is. believe said 5% considered good. swear people need get internet look world around realize people kinda care anymore lol. shows much less active sub compared used be. Woah, we’re halfway Right. may also think he’s gone Trump road far enough may viable career outside Trump. Although would great opportunity pivot gracefully... meant factory farming plants instead animals. Check Attenborough's recent doc, Netherlands approach highlighted hear out, eat bats?
Maybe even ones wet market asia. ""accidentally"" release lab. us self enacted harsh lockdowns, months low case counts would amazing mental health. Americans change behavior much March April, could see point. spent much time asking *could* film movie, never stopped ask *should*. He’s Trump acolyte True, stimulus strong people spend it. words, there's consumer confidence regards health risks, stimulus effect locked bank accounts. Sure might help month's rent that's economy bleeding. Retail, travel leisure, restaurants deep bleed at. people feel safe money spent there. see point though, disagreement. antibiotics already go factory farmed animals keep healthy they’re horrid conditions. Jesus, last thing need even COVID exposure first responders.
Yeah, people higher exposure risk totally go sit together indoors large numbers... good title Sounds like medical disaster film...So evil man tormenters encouraged spread virus across country, killing hundreds thousands, holding rallies plead followers spread more. Unsatisfied, spread White House Virus highest levels government across country. ....To continued. Lmao based. Gonna people thread seething live Nova Scotia . mask mandate became mandatory end July, effectively reduced cases 0. it’s difficult say role masks playing Reducing spread hasn’t anything spread several months . also stringent isolation rules incoming travellers(14 days) . It’s likely keeping cases 0 masks point. Lmfao GOP? hurt unless Trump actually dies. CL EL week pretty strong impact spread Europe.  Recent Netflix doc. stating happened TX. Tops? Well, cleaning staff exactly wear gloves avoid leaving fingerprints stuff cleaned, **gloves protect skin constant exposure chemicals**.

The stuff humans use dissolve organic material exactly easy skin. 

My skin handle pretty much anything harsh chemicals, saltwater plant oils makes people break itchy red patches think remember people terrible skin reactions abnormally high exposure otherwise normal stuff, like **Eczema** **Aquagenic Urticaria**. 

The general increase hand hygiene causing people develop issues never before, triggering people already problems skin, rapidly develop open sores forth. that, Door County? could maybe see since playground city folks. rural Wisconsin general low percentage people complying mask mandates summer far fall. see lot signs doors restaurants bars actively encourage people wear masks. I've stop getting takeout local restaurant shopping local dairy store none employees either place wear masks (let alone many customers). Hello. realize land use grow plants used animal feed? reduction animal farming means reduction plant farming well. 

A plant based society perfect, much much much better. think reason symptom free Dex masking inflammation pain antivirals supplanting immune system's antibody production, making seem though virus gone.

I'm doctor but, know drugs potential serious side effects, increase likelihood longer person them. body currently producing antibodies entered WR's care. Eventually taken drugs, body start producing antibodies (and know given one side effects Dex suppresses immune system), happens? crashes? shown basically pile drug effects body immune system trashed can't recover own? also can't stay drugs him?

Maybe I'm wrong, doctors brilliant, knows. Efficient dictatorship. Luck draw Theyre ""Just flu"" troll likes encourage people act recklessly.  tests one week first symptoms detected 30% people COVID-19. Accuracy increased week 2 70% detected, highest week 3 (more 90% detected). Little evidence available week 3. Tests gave false positive results 2% without COVID-19.

With two negative PCR tests two negative antibody tests probably reasonable assumption COVID. anyone else team get tested? THIS. I’m tired living world warped view justice. weed? Years prison. Actively knowingly spreading disease that’s killed hundreds thousands? Well save life continue.  Thats generally correct. could try deduce 10.8% positives testing random sample population. reality testing people way suspected virus, making biased sample. One could argue people going stadium special subgroup population too, would hard say covid distribution people tested. Lol, that's good one!

If really think stupid, believe whole world convinced Covid real :)  think Doctors. Doctors became patient friend. something would gone wrong Joy Ride. Secret Services could sued, Doctors would sued . people would responsible paying Lawsuits. weak minded people. Amercans broke paying Lawsuit. People Offices held accountable people.  Democrats: Yes, rather getting Donald live white supremacy getting hands pee tapes releasing we're going cook virtuous hoax, torpedo economy, kill 210,000+ people *with heavy casualties democratic areas*. get rid Donald sure! foolproof! Call every country, they're gonna need this...

Intern: Trump responds positively virus listening medical experts, encouraging proper precautions, thoughtful stimulus economic measures keep Americans safe financially secure this?

Democrats: *Trump*. Whatever right thing he's going opposite. Call China! Release virus! germs may travel well outdoors SARS COV II not. Stop anti-science. Disney fake. exist ( /s ) Eh, thing mask I’m walking outside myself? perhaps passing 2 people across street? understand importance indoor use amongst “crowds”, though nobody much excuse crowd days. Wearing one outside far people alone ridiculous. New Zealand accepts 40,000 50,000 immigrants year. Austria recently accepted 200,000 first time, vast majority India China.

As ""I'm gonna move Canada!"" claims, people talk moving countries spent exactly zero time actually looking immigration policies. Turns every first world country tighter immigration standards U.S. Reddit anti science doubt it... think gain staying healthy long trump infected smoking alcohol addictions, can't avoid food entirely Binge Eating Disorder.

I remember therapist told this. body dysmorphia probably eating disorder well relationship food extra unhealthy. also substance addiction issues, know hard could drug choice forced limit (I prescribed necessity, days easiest). Food same. Food satisfying coke me, honestly. Put bowl pasta nice marinara mixed salty cheese make pick one would go food. 

My solution really healthy work like hour half daily take steroids food went muscle creation. worked well like 3 years hit wall wanted keep getting bigger put fat would start using insulin dangerous decided, plus get big scary looking muscle gut. made address relationship food big time. 

I hope find works you. Binge eating disorder still issue intermittent fasting one main things found helpful. found helpful training mind tolerate hunger better. still sometimes binge ate, think made stomach shrink time ability became reduced. 

Clearly mental health problems time period, still some, significantly better many ways body dysmorphia one ways. agree, mental health issue anyone weight facing repercussions weight change behavior. I've seen many people heart attack keep eating same, imagine Christie health problems weight whether joints organs. 

**tldr:** I'm stoned type lot I'm stoned. agree, mental health issues play anyone weight heavy enough cause problems concern. ain't little chubby, weight life shortening quality life reducing, willing sacrifice quality life food shows mental health problem.

I wish best weight loss well. “morbidly obese,” fwiw.  third time....for fourth time...for fifth time... also chickens “in wild” could see things happened. depended slavery upward flow capital slave owners business partners. actually require slaves, better bottom line pay workers. Arguing weren’t fighting keep slaves ignorant dance around it, ever state declaration secession mentions slavery explicitly reason war. says multiple times. leaders rebellion wrote letters mention fact. war traitors reintroduced American politics, whereby people, mostly notably Robert E. Lee, began make public letters statements claiming war vague notion states rights economic welfare South. However, empty political propaganda politicians hoping restart careers national stage. time war leading war individuals never mentioned vague notions states rights, repeatedly lament fear losing slaves say loss slavery would lead war. ahistorical propaganda made mainstream 1930s started seeing revisionist Historians South creating Myth start war based States rights, really taking success *Gone Wind* made nationwide appeal false notion way show films modern world distorted reasons modern wars actions performed wars.  good, rational leadership get us this! don’t support factory farms. buy pasture raised chicken/eggs grass fed beef. also eat organ meat, would otherwise fed cats dogs.

So, never go restaurant? never eat outside? never eat friends places? :) Oh 3 months pandemic? Nice conveniently excluding democrats (and many Republicans) Congress tested positive. list incomplete leads wrong conclusion IMO.

[Mark Meadows claims Trump good Would accurate say reason America 'take seriously' healthcare system capable enough handle it?

That reason Sweden took lax approach enough capacity healthcare system, seems case America really overloaded healthcare system. think 14-day quarantine requirement key. countries welcome US visitors require that. choose one other?

Because capacity choose refugee families dehumanized society spoiled greedy dictator knows joy worsen human suffering.  may become highest cases, please read again. Yes, understand animals killed harmed production milk, eggs, meat, fur, leather.  I'm ND. crazy here, everyone seems denying it. Hospitals filling transport people around lack beds low staffing. 

It's major cities here, either. Small counties booming like crazy. September double amount deaths last highest month. 

No mask mandate except stores require it. governor thinks pull together goodness hearts. 

I feel like I'm surrounded idiots. Experts based scientific evidence, they’re confused all. lol antibiotic resistance biggie comes factory farming case people know. think questionable. producing enough virus detected test, unlikely producing enough transmit people. 

The BinaxNow test could small window possible. Cycle thresholds 33 starts fall detectability. could infective short period time test positive. 

Similarly I'd imaigine thing applying RT-PCR.  would highly unlikely someone testing negative RT-PCR still infecting others. 

This would highlight need test everyone event rely saying ""yeah, tested two days ago negative"". measured influenza deaths way count coronavirus deaths, would 4 500k “flu deaths” year, get fucked ""would like us leave room let fix yourself?"" let’s go hit bars strip clubs!!!! Yeah it’s false hypothetical nothing current situation, i.e. Stephen Miller COVID thoughts bearing status whatsoever Tease. dad believe now? Aren’t making exact point? I’m saying taking mask public dangerous likely things without mask one would appropriate. problem link Greensboro survey don’t clarify would assume. 36% said eat restaurants also 36% 38% say go family gatherings. get it. need 7 masks. done day put away come back. gets stuff it, replace it. Replace masks every 2 weeks. 

If hospital cant afford 14 masks every month every employee need hospital. keeps saying stuff twitter, know truly dead??? /s definitely pre existing conditions, though, right? Right? Guys? Right? thing good standing bikini. yet lot things need trouble getting. Things like shelter, potable water, healthy food, etc. Sometimes wish would let Darwinism thing. Two beds! Ha! would kill millions people. can't get rid factory farming without replacing food generates. World population 100% based ability humans produce food. food production goes up, population.

Now, think could MUCH better factory farming help reduce covid. would cost (not problem opinion). someone explain, correcting vitamin deficiency (42% population U.S. suffer that) pushed viable addition toolset battle covid? [Dr. John Campbell pretty good video explaining would guess, can’t eat bread beans many things, point, need calories nutrients. 

If eat meat though, aware system is. don’t support factory farms. buy pasture raised chicken/eggs grass fed beef. also eat organ meat, would otherwise fed cats dogs.

If you’re concerned antibiotic resistance disease incubation environmental degradation, that’s do. you’re primarily concerned fact need kill animals eat meat, might go vegan. I'm sorry, believe anybody deserves get care matter circumstances. Populist government rule no. 1: can't coronavirus problem test people. There's really one virus although mutated forms. get analogy really fit here. find imitation work. Alternatives try meat better - block tofu closer cheese meat, IMO, lentils/beans great different ways meat. 

Same goes even stuff like veggie burgers. try beef, - lentil burger ketchup might gross, goes well completely different flavors like hummus pickled shredded beets. allowed send patients like home. he’s engineer doesn’t mean he’s intelligent.

Zoonosis emergence linked agricultural intensification environmental change. Proceedings National Academy Sciences, 110(21), pp.8399-8404. mean.. kinda though. means leave rancid feces stuck rear end while, wait see quickly starts affecting health. experts charged murder disagree you? agree teachers do..but burger flippers/shelf stockers much cause easily replaceable 1. restrictions save people COVID long haul? whole point lockdowns originally flatten curve overrun hospitals create even deaths. point reduce area curve (i.e. total amount dead, considering overrun hospitals). 

2. shortened lifespans lockdowns compare lives saved flattening curve (see #1 above)? balance things? think look sides equation, COVID deaths side. people say actually getting lying narrative? lucky getting mils symptoms It’s black white. need measured reopening, basically happening reason set experts confused by. That’s certainly hope least. Fair Obesity result health issues. Physical and/or mental. sign living food desert and/or poor self care education. lot reasons somebody may weight+. pessimistic models wrong ignored possibility strong seasonal component spread. 

But terms happen everyone gets infected, wrong.

Peru already 80-90,00 deaths (the official count might 33,000 excess deaths 3X higher), 33M people, much younger population Sweden, PFR several times higher. Still, everyone Peru infected, cities ran population saturation, overall not. 

Meanwhile Sweden 6,000 deaths 6-8% seropositivity. 

Thus 100K deaths projection really wrong all.

The real question happens next 5-10 years, happens first 6 months pandemic. 

And Sweden still go even single full winter. Really vague article really shoddy information 'top' health official state. comparing to? long talking sustained trend? Furthermore, there's mention schools operating terms partially virtual, remote/hybrid option, etc. Totally vague data still may accurate show trend, one discounting that, that's generally shitty way getting conclusion suddenly safe open schools. Everyone sub talks listening experts, experts disagreeing flip out, good job r/coronavirus. typically long covid last get infected? examples created equal. Asking people remain socially isolated knows long equivalent asking people forego drinking public enclosed spaces. assume allowing people limited--look COVID restrictions small, private gatherings yo get idea means--form close socialization tantamount killing people clear falsehood one grounded kind logic science. There's few, may trolls I've seen comments I'm NZ, article mentions entry currently closed everyone except NZ citizens permanent residents. 

I imagine they're going relax entry restrictions rest world gets pandemic control. WW1 2 numbers also paint picture absolutely fucking horrible look US numbers.

Look Verdun, single battlefield 8-9 months almost half million died there. there's absolute shitshow like Russia WWII What's next , Bezos got million Dollar start business. ?? 


You idea Bezos started Amazon yet hold expert opinion it. /. sarcasm Health experts equals science. 
Why Reddit evidence? me, ""squashed"" means done, wrap.

Yep. Two separate outbreaks (even different strains virus) squashed different times year.... like stepping two different cockroaches.

They squashed. ""rise small farms"" meet demand would worst thing imaginable environmentally. would require vastly resources, space, food, produce greenhouse gasses, etc etc. Factory farms made efficiency.

The *only* option way less demand. People need start realizing eating four times recommended protein every single day (US *average*), mostly animals, ridiculously unnecessary wasteful. actually get *all* protein need plants, there's *tens thousands* edible species. There's gonna least enjoy of, *promise.* 200+ lbs overweight one point life, even realize mental disorder. OA eventually worked me, I'm holding (it literally replaced bad behaviors better addictive behaviors), also learned underlying fears literally causing eat unhealthy behaviors life. continue replace old behaviors, I'm therapy overcoming real fears much longer process ever imagined. Good luck journey, different us. Ugh, I’m farmer, going hate matter say. watched Dominion sap fest. don’t factory farm animals shouldn’t treated like that, humans eat meat there’s nothing wrong that. already guidance Halloween CDC. Basically, trick treating. hard? professions especially teachers anyone dealing public.

Yes, includes burger flippers shelf stockers. 

It’s past time re-evaluate consider “meaningful work” deserves living wage. really hate “up”voting things like this... worst part wreckless comments display macho bravado via Trump cause people lower guard take threat seriously.

I hoped maybe would realize fucking hospitalized shot every drug planet, team fucking doctors keep breathing... nope. Complete denial downplaying, stupid maniac. Fucking idiots. sociopathic streak total disregard others showing. long bear mind testing alone enough. 

\#rosegardenmassacre quote Douglas Adams

This end tears. Probably already has. Frankly it'll miracle Christie pulls without issues. He's exactly picture health. guess gave away I'm small town. Even ""big"" towns part Upstate NY (Plattsburgh, Glens Falls, etc.) Dollar Stores rent places interspersed ""regular"" businesses. second wave Brazil really really big one ripples. Sure. time fix issue. is.  Nitrile gloves anything necessarily. I've seen people wear still touch clothes, face arms, etc thereby contaminating anyway. Also, wearing gloves need make sure touch phone wallet anything gloves, people store. also need make sure take without contaminating yourself. Gloves necessary protect unless careful wearing them. Best use hand sanitizer store done shopping wash hands get home. overrun

That's metric matters thanks confirming Protests outdoor full masks minimal risk needed, indoor bars gyms restaurants dining high risk recreational needed. Big difference. ? discussion needs happening. Talks find medium protects vulnerable allowing healthy continue still work. can’t discussion large majority still convinced lockdown way dismiss concerns working class fucked restrictions go costa fucking rica, I’m gonna stay put Yes literally impossible, would swear virus hired lobbyists donating DeSantis re-election campaign. classify condition fake news send home. it’s like China Virus White House Virus? Bear mind scientists outliers. 

As someone cogently pointed another thread linked article, even tobacco industry found scientists deny mounting evidence product harmful, allowing tobacco continue sold day. asthma? Wow super high risk then. here, followed strictly everything california. said fuck it. left states live mexico while. wear masks one anymore. interact much got virus fuck it, I'm healthy young.im going toward anyone either, get approached me, I'm always outside. many die US alcohol, smoking obese per year? 

Millions imagine mainstream media, Wikipedia page, clearly approved NWO, otherwise nobody would even hear this.

There must beyond obvious. Could controlled opposition. said viral douche mean youtube instagram influencer? Aggain, back: want intubated. want stuck bed hallway cafeteria. want put field hospital converted parking lot parking garage. fun. even fun room yourself. summer camp y'all. 

Wear mask, social distance, wash yo hands.

Edit: words Wash hands touch face Sweden closest what's discussed. Neither gained economically effectively prevented deaths.

My country Poland (which close Sweden) full lockdown serious measures, silly ""recommendations"". economy less distracted Swedish one, deaths per million 74 (PL) vs 582 (SE).

We relaxed initial success started behave Swedes do. Now, second wave rolling out, things looking good anymore meaning. 

Mask social distancing enough cases growing rapidly, lockdown way stop spread scenario. hand, full lockdown needed situation control, enough beds hospitals. Yet, restrictions besides masks distancing necessary keep situation controlled (no gatherings kind sure).

Polish ""from hero zero"" scenario second wave, seen European countries successful first wave. took similar approach beginning, relaxed later hitting us much stronger, result severe economic consequences would keep ""moderate"" restrictions whole time lockdowns finished. Chance death COVID less 1% across age groups, significantly better younger are. 20 people far event test positive. Statistically would quite rare die. That's fucking asinine. Hospitals (particularly large systems) losing money one going elective surgeries bread butter. I'm saying good system, Covid completely disrupted it.

The last estimate saw American Hospital Association estimated loss **40 billion** March June alone. Convict lock ass up. Let enjoy fresh air prison yard maskless.  maybe started conspiracy putting covid chemtrails boneheads start wearing masks reason, personal me.

1st. nutritional aspect meat can't get foods. trace minerals, fats many things needed. 

2nd. minor auto-immune issues veggies carbs general aggravate them. Meat anti-inflammatory greatly reduces issues. still eat veggies, needs select ones.

3rd. pre-diabetic reduced carbs increase fat helps great deal. BG A1C stable sometime lazy Keto diet.

4th. Without meat small farms gone. Grazing cattle, chickens livestock good environment unless country cutting forests cattle.  Grazing grass feed cows much less methane released meat much cleaner.

I opposed people going veg vegan, that's choice. 

My daughter aspiring athlete. vegan vegetarian alone great athletes. Many done moved away it. balanced approach that's necessary.

I know get lot hate stance that's fine. fan factory farms all. Animals slammed together filled drugs eventually get water stain world.  regenerative farming good. needs visible come cheaper, pretty expensive point. Well, reports earlier stated, White House totally misusing rapid Covid test kits, excuse wear masks. 

So Christie probably thought fine everyone around passed one tests. 

Not saying right, definitely see flawed logic comes from. must joking ventilator thing. one intubated ""trying supplemental oxygen""... high flow, bipap, prone positioning, etc intubating. Exactly things now. suddenly invented new form delivering oxygen. things changed meds available (convalescent plasma, remdesivir, dex, etc.).  People deny climate change spite overwhelming evidence.

They could necks water still deny it. soon political party major corporations make political point, over. Adherents toe party line regardless science. think success often causes people identify bootstrap Republican-types else. becomes part identity, judgement forever crippled. it’s not. 

It’s oblate ellipsoid, therefore perfectly round. there's lot people who, believe not, live country Sweden's case numbers rising well. must presidential election year. family running account. They've changed name ""The Cain Gang"" China though. could originate place animal agriculture exists. solely blame China absolve responsibility. could easily originate USA, anywhere else next time. One solutions support animal ag artificially keeps meat prices low. many complicated problems, one instance thing actually make difference environment prevent negative health outcomes.  want obviously, IIRC, house arrest pretty nice house Vancouver area, plus everyone quarantining anyways. ever time house arrest, guess 2020 year that... That's tbh. science politics. We’re pandemic right now, thousands people world dying. encourage voting, it’s going solve pandemic problems, especially quickly. Playing finger pointing game you’re angry feel helpless getting old. Take care yourself, encourage others around same. Time bring vaccine resistances, natural selection control right now. “If it’s happening it’s happy all!” I’m sick morons like this. Dolphins keeping limit 13K though. Detroit? surprised. fast food joints bulletproof glass. someone knew died Covid rest world locked indefinitely regardless negative impacts lost someone. I’m sorry doesn’t mean fuck everyone else  severely disrupting airflow offices. Tipping culture worst, establishments paid decent wage. American system bullshit Except pesky issue TBI players, nevermind what's hypocrisy? ""This Extremely Dangerous Democracy""

 Change ""Deadly Obese."" Morbidly drive home know definition ""Diseased"". really many super fats nursing home. doubt many countries offer adequate level pandemic circumstances need must certainly exceed supply. I’m waiting peer reviews personally. Since see logic masks period. 

People anti mask won’t convinced non peer reviewed study contrary belief system. probably even peer reviewed one would imagine.   shame interfere nature's course sometimes think people reject science, way smoker reject science claims cigarettes gives cancer. person eating burgers soda.  HEPA filters. one running house. Kamala would like four around times. I’m going defend US wealth gap anger rising wealth billionaires pandemic misplaced. vast majority rise due men like Bezos tech companies. quarantines lockdowns started, online services saw massive explosions use. saw young boy give speech Bidens acceptance wondered many adults going give death threats. cult disgusting.  Actually, since mentioned neighbouring countries... actually similar measures lot time. Sweden probably even measures summer, lower gathering limit quite while. Yeah, experts may underestimated virus start, apart that, plenty epidemiologists believe type long-term strategy Sweden has. can't small sink work. 
😢 know can't change them. natural instinct confront someone who's actively trying hurt people community. China 0 cases, it'll never new cases. there's solid testing + contact tracing system place, outbreak quickly quarantined dealt with. We've seen happen several Chinese cities recent months (e.g., Beijing, Dalian, etc.)

And exponentially spreading disease, moving quickly paramount - delaying response mere days could mean 10x cases deal TWO WEEKS!!! takes one superspreader event change findings radically. New York set highest record new cases day last week? someone works ER, tell certainly ""better more"" testing! fact contrary, run time, perhaps months ago... dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm nurse hear you. far worse beginning deniers saying ""It's little flu."" spent first months online trying help educate people known facts time. Even late days ago someone still telling this, point, easier nod agreement, continue wear mask, let deniers learn time change topic something much neutral, like food. could end lockdowns. hate them.

Just pure, unadulterated, grade A+++, burning power million suns, hate.

I past feeling sorry them, pitying them, laughing them.

They ones holding back society. ones nothing gets done. oppose change, hold onto tradition, refuse believe science proof even around them. 

They nothing gets done pollution, global warming, threats survival species. long allow influence decisions, deserve survive species.

We real lemmings, rushing towards cliff, refusing stop even slow down, refusing, group, believe gravity.

I hate much, growing hate people defend them, too. all, threats survival. Bet wishes experimental treatment President received. long much fucked sake vulnerable. discussion options don’t forsake one group save another. Especially reality non vulnerable majority Yeah people you’re making change. It’s momentary best. ok while, exploded again. sure stupidity, disbelief, lock fatigue  Sad true. US public needs educated particular men depression depression manifests men (as anger), also, daunting task changing stigma around men recognizing sick need medical help.

(Unlike President needs Dex.) I'm trying convince /u/DrVeganazi. That's going happen...

And he's going convince you. That's going happen...

Right? I'm sure position strong get automatically pretend like high ground here. discussion without silly posturing.

Moreover, guarantee, (for whatever reason) say ""set tragic music phase me"" getting downvoted. ever since then, back-peddling, pretending like give shit. phased sit act like care? care htf phased? 

You're place. actually seem stand anything except ""meh meat"". hey, look, I'm meat eater too. We're actually probably pretty close much alike way. come forums pretend like I'm higher horse anyone else. I'm not. like taste cheeseburgers steak.

And bro, I'll honest, whole lot ""average redditor"" seem think. I'm sure that's bat even bother try swinging. gotta do. Dollar stores Rent-a-centers tend rough neighborhoods. Grocery store went Buffalo armed duty BPD guard duty. would conclude that? wrong trolly said? Sure, threw little humor end. I’m 100% serious horrors COVID alarmism, it’s fact Italy’s healthcare system subpar compared equally wealthy countries. Tell grandchildren relatives that, see them, spendables ones He's worst superhero. Even DC make film it. learn quantify risk instead? old old people (70-80s).
They kids school. many people going like it'll never happen. told would ""virtue signalling"" though bad thing

It's virtues (morals beliefs) offensive people none Okay calling BS one. worked contract tracer Los Angeles two months. protests LA , particularly Hollywood Downtown, led significant spread. read wasn’t evidence spread cities (NYC, Minneapolis). However LA significant. It’s hard say why. it’s also extremely difficult trace outbreak specific location without lots cooperation public. public large cooperate contact tracers. 

The going theory LA protests led significant spread carpooling protest events. able trace chain dozen infections group drove protest together left two extra people, one virus infected everyone car. people infected others social/family group. Jesus that’s bad six figures worth bodies make laugh loud.

It takes kinds make internet, guess. Probably! 😂 guy huge POS doubt it. Would really worst thing world?  Let's not. absolutely believe one bit. prefer measure units 9/11s Yes, blame restaurant workers either lose job. Get grip, dumbass. I'll however long takes. problem whatsoever me. Stretch Covid away! Maybe diet? Nowadays we're lot healthier 100 years ago, malnutrition(even slight) child might push period back years. Starvation adult stop would make sense.

*This completely unfounded hypothesis So. Where’s thread doing?

Because title thread. know. meat. 

Shut interesting. know trump lies. Please post related outcome tragic call called upon result exposed. Thank you. Next tragic story please. Time short. Thanks grew Florida kid dad used tell Florida great state live lack income tax. I'm old enough understand good idea. dad scoffs say would gladly pay taxes better social services. Meanwhile I'm terrified young people hospitality services high risk. People care residents Florida. baffling tourists treat area. survive roll take it. Sacrificing much along way little money. That's ridiculous oversimplification. excuse choose use justify choice, regards current president. Somehow screeching top one's lungs ""others"" ruining country turned plenty people certain side 2016, apparently fearmongering works one side. They're sadists position gaslighting protect feelings sadists. 

As logical person universe would choose wear mask give protecting family solely someone internet mean them. reason real threat Covid, long term, vast population people become disabled permanent damage. going present serious problem terms support people - going able work. Pretending Covid hoax, denying serious set civilization huge number disabled citizens take care rest lives. shocking. could possibly foreseen this? ""That's little one-tenth 1%, says rate seasonal flu."" No, that's CFR flu- IFR estimated 0.01%

Also, number based estimated (arbitrarily, might add) total infections confirmed deaths. probably closer 0.3% surprise there. hate trump much. Covid messing brain, he's gonna get even unhinged pretty soon Huh, Dr friend survived covid seems think mutates often vaccinate against.

Buckle up! horrible turns 12 year old pregnant limbless baby. assuming that:

A) Countries reporting deaths accurately (they not)

B) 760+ million infected (they not) Well id like admit covid issue blown proportion political fincancial gains. 

Not ""we must lockdown till every single person covid free"" good start though. check ""this podcast kill you"" general. Great podcast. must missed said ""I care covid problem matters"". I'm industry got wrecked shit, absolutely sacrificed things like reasonable person pandemic. know, really sacrificed much compared people lost lives shit people like want throw hands air say ""fuck it, people die time"". education world useless unless one learn. taught major element society actions education matter, thing matters persuade easily manipulable habitually ignorant people pursuit power money. Frankly, Biden wins November, want see pack mask per person bottle sanitizer mail every person US immediately. No, not.

First, pulled 760M number ass

Second, lot active cases resolved yet, thus cannot counted towards IFR calculation. 

Third, insane assume cases severely undercounted, deaths been.

When well known excess deaths 2-3X official numbers number places (and many others never get excess death counts nobody keeping track). fourth, quite examples confirmed PFRs greater 0.2% already, small sample size, IFR 0.13% cannot be.  big part diet, honestly. Women hit certain body fat level (as well nutritional factors, I'm sure) kicks in, sometimes hear female athletes delayed development. diets gotten better women hit point earlier, results earlier onset puberty becoming fertile. 

Same reason we're much taller people even generation two ago. eat better, least sense calorie intake access essential vitamins, bodies able reach potential instead stunted. quit career devoted last 5+ years life obtaining

Tell millions Americans lost jobs permanently due lockdown find work other, lower-paying industries order put food stop prick minutes try sympathize kind year person likely had.

Anyone going online whinge complain job right needs seriously reevaluate. care are, go around demanding respect, really deserve it. frightening President Pence may be, agree you.  rate WND Questionable based extreme right-wing bias, promotion conspiracy theories numerous failed fact checks. Lol okay. Don’t fear reaper. dumb ass is. guy first rang alarm bells thalidomide actually good evidence, lying. interesting moral philosophy question. cool, i'm sure friends family infect January thank advance I'm getting flu shot first time year getting date EVERYTHING fast financially can, no, mean getting tetanus stick dirty nails body want, that's vaccines work.

I think wakeup call locking people work kids schools comply. might separate real anti-vaxxers posers want trendy, imperfect USAmerican, always told vaccines something would protect ME.

I'm sure improve employability make sure measles whooping cough vaxes date. care get whooping cough German Measles serious diseases adults, could kill kid.

I even remember measles not. know chicken pox, I'm going need get titers done measles.

We need change thought processes getting vaccines protect getting vaccines protect others. people need protect people can't take particular vaccine.

I'm saying anti-vaxxers exist selfish, narrating thought processes big pain-in-the-butt (pun intended) expensive project mine.

Or maybe could start calling kids ""ankle biters"" yelling get lawn. ;) believe runny nose symptom covid. However potential symptoms would never hurt get tested. get vaccine soon available me. need protect father diabetes, heart issues, obesity. He’s Uber driver also high risk, would want give him.

He won’t take it, sad.  Absolutely true, socialization non-issue early stage. 

But develops, going become increasingly important interacts people (and children). inflection point though, open debate. 

Some would say 6 months. Others would say 1 year. I'm sure could find experts think socialization important 2+. 

My initial point though cut dry though as, ""if bring small child enclosed space without mask, bad parent.""

We may well find future there's entire group children behind social skills missed critical developmental milestones could well avoided parents taken calculated risk things like introducing strangers grocery store.

Or may find kids fine pandemic subsides, right call keep home 1 - 2 years! 

But right now, parents kids information have. see baby grocery store, maybe give parents benefit doubt assume pediatrician told socialize baby, rather assume they're negligent twats.  Please let true. me, also depends kind vaccine is. E.g. moderna one based technoligy never used company zero track record. lot iffy one than, e.g. Oxford one based something already know safe. fucking bad. virus give shit breaking point. ""Restaurant staffers quarantine working Τrump fundraiser"", none receive compensation, healthcare, apology simply going work thay day. workers 2 weeks behind everything quarantine actually get Corona. May lose car home, credit fucked, 23% cards. Kids food, money laundry, electricity, gas, phones go off.

This best case scenario. 

BECAUSE WENT WORK!!!! ? know careful pregnant people back then. idea. Now, thalidomide, extremely carful drugs pregnancy.  Yes did. spent months slowly reopening soon cases rose due people failing comply basic requirements like masks distancing, areas get extra monitoring, testing shut downs. aides COVID. Stephen Miller, main aid tested positive. vaccines already produced, least couple million doses, operation warp speed. Distribution administering vaccine another thing though. Sweden US similar per capita fatality rates, thanks Trump's incompetence.

Yes, would use ""mass"" describe them. everybody wasn’t hurry go we’d nearly subdued virus everyone actually could go out. Snap judgement anyone hasnt seen friends family since started beyond delusional. every single person know 90 immune deficient? Seriously go live bubble even covid done youre scared real world. friend tell going afraid COVID. asked could affect people passed someone afford lose work hours. 

No reply.

Selfish fucking pig. sue republican party supporting gathering trump administration lost wages due false statements. Also sue medical costs. Go every republican (personally) tested positive since event since sure violated mask distancing guidelines. Losing money way feel anything. Well, can't catch pregnancy someone else. senate made clear offers help, House unwilling negotiate good faith. clearly, Nancy banking voters like complaining got new ferarri, Chevy would enough. Ohio--despite map really northern state Let's take account people die Covid hospitals reported collect money. know 2 folks told signed significant died covid hospital Bill's would forgiven. Mississippi said fuck mask mandate know state fair starts week want show Covid bad asses guess. really know anything contact tracing stand comment guarantee one side effects COVID-19 penchant communism administration would mobilize greatest mask-wearing campaign imaginable. literally said lockdowns may answer, want me? Wear mask social distance, that's ask. fucking sucks me. Christmas cancelled last year us flu (tested positive) FIL. get together either side family infants sides, I'd share flu older people. kid missed 8 yr old Christmas she'll miss 9 yr old Christmas too. many years left ""magical"" (maybe none). country BLM demonstrations nothing, like crowded beeches also harm.

But still reckless them, way telling became superspreader event not. No, frank, personally use word ""mass"" describe 6k deaths.

What word would use relation say, 200k+ deaths US?

And go ridiculous tangent, let stop you; I'm defending, comparing attacking anything here, aside use word ""mass"". Yeah. one Johnson Johnson 1 dose ambient temperature vaccine requires freezing, sweet. 

This one also went phase 3 premanufacturing, 5 western countries already phase 3, couple almost ready month, rest following shortly thereafter, tf would reliable vaccine, shipped ready go March next year, even earlier.

People arguing baffles me.

If don’t open vaccine, there’s obviously greater agenda here. exist opposite spectrum world. fucking dread going back ""normal."" must person enjoyed shutdown actually better ever before. day work says ""Get"" return spending 9+ hrs day arbitrary office ill right back unemployed counting days life retirement. Fuck life. due respect grandmother, would also died flu? 

Honestly, people US learn wear mask even flu season less vulnerable die. apparently much Americans, judging downvotes. 

These psychos terrify me. I've got MS want kill me. everloving fuck. recent spike slightly inflated though excel fuck-up

I thought read number nothing backlog. sure? Wait thought California right? Wtf staying home maybe speak nations quickly want keep closed year.

If truly believe must what's best collective, dont stop, listen think people willing accept. Maybe openness outside views make understand different people value different things importantly SHOCKER people dont want stay closed drags long solution implemented suddenly people dying everything huh. Idiot. CB least one person got reference I’ve informed arguably much humanly do. I’ve since Wuhan locked January 23rd. know zero studies children outside clinically observed described MIS-C. 

It hasn’t year US. NYC didn’t even see cases beginning March schools closed statewide March 16. Schools literally reopened NYC October 1. Already schools closed nine neighborhoods.

My point absolutely hasn’t time study infection long term impacts 
children. That’s none published seen. Again, please share studies know. 

So, no, don’t know impacts children long term. know children suffer rare complication short term. That’s it. i'm high risk (asthma)...

i'm learning remotely fall wait see college reopening, seem managing well hope go back February spring term. 

i'm getting groceries delivered store cesspool mask-free idiots, eating favorite coffee place week every two weeks. visiting friends family trust- wearing masks times inside quite bit lax outdoors. course partner friends school lot discord hangouts, virtual movie nights, etc.  i've dropped supplies local BLM marches every Sunday too, things seem pretty safe there, usually stick around family less worry about. 

i remote job i'm incredibly lucky sense, aside pure idiocy seems like main way people get they're forced high risk situation. given school's precautions job situation able avoid that, even returning February. Replace cynic idiot maybe surgeon, nice hear Free COVID-box tickets, entire legislature ! read article procedures anesthesia. long population fine nothing change. decided long ago, weird reason, believe anything Fauci says.

A lot people tuned Fauci combination showing interviews LOT contradicting every week.

Before call conspiracy theorist, here's video evidence, Fauci saying quote: 'People walking around masks. might block droplet, providing protection people think does. often unintended consequences: people fiddling mask touching yeah. lately, Fauci go tv say 'keeping schools closed would wrong approach', next week 're-opening schools could lead enormous increase infections'

And on. trumpian assertive (which was) isn’t aggressive (which were). never attacked personally like attacking me, cursing calling child you’re one who’s childish (just read last sentence, lmao). 

“Limited energy” excuse. high energy levels vegan diet. maximize eating calorie dense foods keeping b12 levels high, among things. it’s another story you’re lazy expect vegan diet magically work instead making work - although lots people get really well without major adjustments. 

And yeah, people convenience (like said it’s “easier” you) higher priority ethics, empathy reason. you’re going eat cow’s corpse, don’t blame me. looking excuse practice shitty morals. NFL right thing would allowing fans, thousands already allowed many stadiums.

The NFL right thing would flying team damned well know likely imminent outbreak halfway across country play game Patriots. Surprise, Patriots testing positive now! Yeah mate, I'm same. never used hunt, thought pulling trigger dropping something that's trying live life awful.
If could press button sudden animal abuse anywhere world, I'd press button.

I good answers either - said, really think way vegans put ideals across right way. number militant vegans aggressive insulting trying show meat eaters they're wrong.

In opinion, Vegans generally correct almost every part tend say, like fight ignorance meat-eater abuse, good adds 'Us VS them' mentality 'meat-eaters VS vegans'

It's like doctor say ""You're fat, disgusting excuse human. look gross, stupid learn eat properly moron even trying better yourself. say go diet, fatty!"" it'd sweet fuck part.
If doctor instead say ""You're medically overweight. put stress internal organs, worrying heart. food used good shorten life. Here's diet plan. I'm right need help it"" - I'd wager people would listen.

Same vegan 'Telling off' meat eater expecting change, rather 'guiding' change.

That said, mention word 'Vegan' lot meat-eaters turn blinders stay belligerent ignorant, even get aggressive vegan chance even utter word.

It's shitty situation because, said above, believe Vegans views life almost entirely spot on, 'Us VS them' stops good progress :/ he's model good health... From...? hurt people saved lockdown. That's like recommending jogging someone wheelchair. least scenario person power run. Trump literally power shut country down. problem spreadsheet refresh properly new cases added been. Great stuff Public Health England! none actually ideal world, experts would give us truth, political party completely dedicated lying us daily basis. government says safe go game Sunday, blame fans wanting believe it? One important lessons HBO’s “Chernobyl” mini-series taught us majority chart still less severe I'm still right. Plus half list severity. Hoyer lift. government-led effort underway determine many people outside official White House staff were exposed virus warn them.

Neat. It’s worst 100 years, brought minority populace. course shouldn’t shove people verbal disagreements. course killing someone anger horrible. course!

But *maybe*...maybe you’re 80 worried getting sick deadly virus, shouldn’t bar middle pandemic anyway. Mon dieu! Net immigration Australia predicted negative coming year. instance Nele Brusselaers released model predicted 96.000 people would die Sweden June current restrictions [1]. 
 
Well, projection closer truth Sweden actual stats Sweden compared Latvia Taiwan. 
 popular frame paint Swedish strategy failure, think interesting question would be, worse? models inaccurate, Sweden lower excess mortality Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, UK? 
 
Partly better outdoors air quality - esp compared Netherlands Belgium. two also higher population densities. part diligent consumers vitamin D, suspect relatively lacking Spain UK. Nordic Baltic countries similar Sweden air pollution vitamin consumption population densities well. Sweden rock bottom compared peers. Bookmarking page see happens next months. People without mask wearing correctly purpose asshole definition.

So prefere take care business avoid like plague.

They made mind already, bother talking them. shit going We’re screwed like happened last time opened bars happen. NYC back soon. mean Argentina? Thots players I've heard 3 weeks filming left. still wrap filming end year. brave them! 'Completely dependent' simply untrue. big industry, one. domestic tourism pretty well moment.

Besides which, sure expensive international tourists coming in. also expensive overwhelmed health system, high number fatalities international tourists coming (because tourism globally taken hit).

I'm happy we're doing. right answer every country, right answer us right now. Saving economy = saving lives Thanks. sure IQ higher Ducky!!! White House always effectively hospital. Details exactly public known operating capacity, diagnostic equipment, blood stock, fully equipped pretty much anything needed deal presidential health emergency.

That said, certainly large least 2 people (president first lady) fell ill illness time. creates potential problem went downhill.

So moving higher risk patient Walter Reed likely better option. Moving First Lady would likely look even like favoritism. president played ""necessary"" national security. He's obviously higher risk anyway moving made sense. first lady looks like eats healthy exercises, likely low risk. anyone full hospital fat ass.

That would guess that. thought could spin moving president preemptively better could spin first lady moved out.

They either got resources White House... first lady's condition improved point really concern two people issues once. beating fellow Orthodox Jewish man hospital disagreeing them. I’m here, wish govt would say White house virus calling day forward.  Can't believe heard today can't grasp why, knowledge human history continue assume people positions power generational wealth smarter average citizen, fact, due pampering sloth often less practical stupid. went bath body works weekend. chick gets behind line begins screaming cell phone within 1 foot me. turned around gave biggest glare. Yes, masks, still social distance! backed keep side eye her. 

This story horrific. don’t advise anyone verbally confront, making eye contact glaring seems work wonders. real MVP Time break Pence Fence Legitimated *voting* part American people. And, first awful Government within last 2 decades. perspective: FL numbers flat decreasing time. ""Being allowed"" ""being stupid enough attend"" two different things. Florida... Malnourished? Oh boy... need education topic I’d say. Otherwise sound foolish calling others plebs internet really don’t know you’re about. That’s health care US. It’s mess. citizenship works lmao agree overall assessment big driver three. folks head here:

Dr Sunetra Gupta professor Oxford University, epidemiologist expertise immunology, vaccine development, mathematical modelling infectious diseases

Dr Bhattacharya professor Stanford University Medical School, physician, epidemiologist, health economist, public health policy expert focusing infectious diseases vulnerable populations.

Dr Kulldorff Professor medicine Harvard University, biostatistician, epidemiologist expertise detecting monitoring infectious disease outbreaks vaccine safety evaluations. Um, job literally make science health based recommendations. would nice charge would listened experts. 

Your doctor recommend exercise certainly can’t force go jog.  Ouch. I’d argue end sight Western Europe well. definitely virus control furthermore, populace mentally drained harsh lockdowns. clearly following restrictions either I’m sure that’s good point either. Maybe Wisconsin send state Supreme Court GOP officials man field hospital, since fought containment measures every turn. support efforts stop Republicans passing bills protect people.

American apparel LA people cardboard dividers packed factories. Seahawks fan, I'm glad got game way last week. It* sure is! Stop thinking everything conspiracy. GAIN CHALLENGING NUMBERS???? 😭😭😭 WAY PAINT IT, IT’S BAD. TRUST INFORMATION MOVE FORWARD BEAT THING get you’re saying view opposite way. you’ve said, restrictions limit COVID life altering. Yet acceptable prevent deaths. 

Banning cigarettes could reduce many deaths much less life altering. fact we’ve collectively decided it’s fine people choose smoke—even though “fix” exponentially easier ridding world COVID—is crazy. fucking asshole 1. Opening schools back raises risk virus spread.
2. schools get lucky avoid outbreak.

Both statements likely true. ppl downvoting this? Ahh, make sense. Fuck, must long ass hours stand front new drinkers every freaking night. POTUS invited hang-ten radical waterboarding Guantanamo Bay! It’s really bullshit believe they’ve tricked lied to. They’ve fed factual information, they’re families agreeing lies, etc. 

Maybe it’s like “is sun star?” Instead “what’s best flavor pie” believe they’ve tricked duped it’s intentionally hurt others think point stands. 

I don’t know many people arguing want people die. That’s fucked up. Italy worries much first wave concentrated provinces. Southern Italy likely little population immunity. see, China transmitted 15 cases US, Trump happy put name labeled covid spread 15 people. think genuinely stupid people ignorant, there's plenty educated college students wear mask. reminds character ""Jeff Winger"" show Community. Essentially really smart, changes beliefs whatever easiest him. Yeah, I'm psych meds already too. I'm basically mess.

I've Effexor XR like 20 years now. Honestly, think I'll ever go it, pretty bad general anxiety (it runs dad's side family), life like medication like night day. huge, huge improvement. Which, guess good want drop it, one hard ones taper off.

I'm also Wellbutrin depression, I'm planning go soon. Things got bad pandemic. I'm usually those. mean you? 100 million pre-diabetics country, least 35 million diabetics. point? end well. I'm close normal be.

Meeting 20 friends bar tonight. masks.

I wear store wherever asked, polite. What's point making recommendation something power do? 🤦🏼‍♀️ try oversimplify things much. “None activities people wanting do...” like fuck say that? activites? I’m talking massive job losses oncoming businesses finally go under. It’s gonna happen lot. Whole areas city soon turn ghost towns “for lease” buildings used employ people pump tax money city. Adios funding schools social services everything else, hello Great Depression. 

Then say “what young people told stay home?” Motherfucker IS. Right last several months it’s EVERYone yeah I’m saying that’s worse SOME.

Also never even fucking implied people “do jack” control it. you’d asked I’d tell everybody wearing masks, even house, especially around old people. serious restrictions shouldn’t applied everyone. would way manageable, unemployment old people put work instead EVERYBODY put work. Good quitting finding better job.

My wife's hospital currently slightly double normal yearly turnover, they're getting new applicants positions. There's reckoning going hospitals last well past end COVID.

I expect healthcare worker shortage going get even worse. point cost effective way provide ""meat"". world magically going stop eating meat thousands years. Wow ""Not much risk"" much risk me. Technically playing Russian roulette one six chance, that's really much risk either.
 
If ""knowledge base"" know different people different acceptable risk levels. mean, put every incoming person managed isolation two weeks, facilities limited. moment space incoming NZers permanent residents, space tourists, example. ""get it"" means you, like Chris Christie, lack empathy.

Chris Christie's self-serving comment trivializing family's tragedies shameful. Maybe invite game? clean ass towel stick. Barista here, get paid less fight sober assholes protect guests too. need close bar seating use tables without table service. sort drill sergeant now, definitely get paid enough this. read article? made recommendation full knowledge couldn’t implement shutdown. good thing science it’s true whether believe it.  Cool ... safe ... mean, friend ... Covid seasonal starting second lap. totally agree there's ""have to"" way, shape form.

Having empathy someone gets joy watching people die interesting way organizing system morality, guess actually work way.

Here CZ made mandatory cca 500 cases day.

Now, month usage 4500 cases day absolutely certain go higher.

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Yeah, downvote me... numbers real lie got way get guy office 2022 Yes that’s true. RI instance deaths per capita 53% higher Florida’s. states hit first people died due poor protection elderly populations (NY’s policies discharging covid patients nursing homes would example that) unprepared healthcare system little knowledge treat virus.

The lockdowns US likely saved lot lives people realize. **anesthetic procedures China referred White House virus context sanitizing groceries extreme behaviour? 

(What give you? know 'one smart ones wear mask' argument /s, spoke like asshole insults others without reason, bloody mask that. Wearing mask, alone, make great, right-with-everything person, pick him, smarter not-the-a-hole. 

Wearing mask can't you, unfortunately, maybe saves sickness.)

Ok, touted everywhere virus spread (mainly) groceries, beginning pandemic lack information, possibility. Even without caring COVID-19 pandemic, one still sanitize groceries - good thing, gets rid bacteria viruses it. 

Also wearing goggles/glasses uncommon, especially workers deal public high risk. 

Why would big deal someone wants wear street extra measure? 

Live life fully ecstatic dude, want, there's nothing weird user saying. 

Also, he/she may exaggerating/sarcastic there, make point hygiene, need sense understand fact take everything LITERALLY, making psychological profile heartbeat - he/she's still right though, even he/she meant everything literally angry careless people. 
What trying say hostility brings upon himself? whom, you? what, stuff coronavirus, stance good HYGIENE PRACTICES? 
Or says something bit anger thought that's potent land annoying someone? 

There angry/annoyed people coronavirus everywhere everyone frustrated it, especially careless people stubborn idiots argue garbage times, even others dying, usually people's relatives, spread PROLONG RESTRICTIONS. Go try luck picking upsetness see goes ""attracting hostility"" asshole one likes. 

Where come that, going guy personally expressed little bit anger? triggers annoy call he's done something wrong press matter him... must one issues, annoying prick group. Talking pandemic looking 'cool' friends.

EDIT: RANT, TIRED STUPID 

So one pricks takes care wears mask, insinuates conversation someone who's angry anti-covid idiots, tease angry see 'how far negativity goes'? still prick approach helping anything worthless topic hand. teasing sides. Worthless topic.

Wearing mask mean bloody asshole. LOL. 

I really get type asshole I've seen topic, people brag attitude chill fight actually say something worthwhile true virus 'they're upset' they're 'so cool' 'that triggered', feel fucking cool rightful conversation, come say wear mask end? IF. means anything. 
in end say garbage actually meddle conversation wrong time suggest reverse, people careful. 

I care think saying realised intervention looks like, *and wear bloody mask*, point still people care, actually, saying garbage. 

The problem extra careful world EXTREME fucking tease they're fucking UNCOOL, but, HELLO, clueless rude silly ... majority aren't. 'cool'. aspect makes look chilled sociable amazing group friends one loner. f. 

Maybe solid reason bitter attitude towards anti-maskers anti-covid folk - think victims' close ones, example, would definitely ... strong rightful. 

Why would angry idiots uncool? Oh ok dude, top bro!!!!!!!! Yeah comparisons war deaths stupid, Reddit loves shit them. Covid tragic WW1 something. Average age death war probably 20 average age death Covid somewhere 70s.  massive difference. I'm sure asked someone lived Gallipoli would rather switch places get covid instead trying take city they'd gladly take covid. agree good source. That's make separate post, tried qualify it. It’s necessary types things White House, safety precaution regardless president one say heart attack something you’d need able quickly possible begin treatment course it’s equipped operating room always well trained medical professionals available time, that’s unacceptable opinion it’s safe prepared, doesn’t really deserve it, unfortunately president fact always important, bad doesn’t get 3000 cases per day pretty bad.

It equals .125 infections per thousand per day.

Which U.S. seeing right now. much ""listen experts"" first name Jessica someone got book kid called ""But Jessica"" something effect. Main character child makes imaginary friend named Jessica. Jessica told bad thing, took two cookies one Jessica,etc time, parent let's way insists telling Jessica (honestly sure moral book was, seem like gleaned nice life lessons this. Mostly gave family fuel make joke exist. baby family. scary sometimes). end, meets girl named Jessica become friends. 

This story like story. Coronavirus. Unfortunately think friendship imaginary virus went well friendship real one. LOL that’s it? mother still believe. Bill Gates major suspect wants create quantum computer mind control, Jeff wants steal land people.. isolating, press would whining be. Freaking vultures. lengths go keep Image Sweden"" unbelievable.

Yeah, like arguing reddit instance. totally crazy. Nobody that. people? literally fighting become separate country 

Ding ding ding.

During war war. war. war, war fighting become separate country. wish intense study stuff. Anecdotal evidence like great I’d like see actual study. also flawed testing lagging indicator, preventive measure. 

""Hey babe, wear condom?"" 

""Nah, bother, take pregnancy test every morning!"" I've indoor dining give tip $10 minimum, proudly stand outlier assumptions. “Pretended effects”? don’t know something works, must mean *doesn’t* work, mind?

Many treatments many illnesses varying degrees side effects. Mental illness different. Antipsychotics literal life savers people. people, doctors, weighed risks side effects benefits. banned every medication potential side effects, would none left. banned every medication don’t know exactly works, we’d lot less options.

Heck, don’t even know exactly freaking *Tylenol* works. think ban that, too? Well cause rise, sarcasm, supposed stop it... think relatively outside US consider leader world way. Whether Biden (should win) regain title, knows. think lot countries decided distance US fickleness that's seen respect countries getting wearying. Even Canada, obvious geographic advantages every country trading US, worked last couple decades diversify trade, think speaks volumes. would REALLY surprise Houston 8-10 big football stadiums.

The problem able televise/record games way people used to.

Edit: two huge stadium football: H1N1 deadly, nothing compared Coronavirus.
Is simple. China SARS 2002, ignored caused, nothing, endure Coronavirus, understand people get angry China? CNN saying couldve super spreader event course you’re beating dead horse played old Louis CK bit. *maybe* funny valid point wouldn’t getting downvoted it. Remind 90 days. wow. happened! Fragile people MUST hurt animals pleasure. white Jesus would wanted... ineptitude amazes #mishewmania Yeeesh mean close 1% population dies every year regardless I'm gonna delete mine well godamn need head there. must nice living state isnt run like north korea funny thing beat. Chicago blowing state lockdown. certain political party didn’t like lockdown took court. state got prematurely opened Bam! Covid thunder fucking fuck state. political party trying get people Wisconsin remove masks ......today. truly death cult. seems bit silly Spanish flu 1918 masks mandated many municipalities, services like barber shops mandated operate solely doors. little scientific evidence 100 years later we’re struggling face overwhelming evidence even take basic measures accepted back then? come far, yet arguing what’s proven work. said goes research? COVID regularly present GI disease? people infectious 2 weeks? therapeutics available mild cases? Come man, denial. Well watch openly explained did. designed raise awareness terms like organic free range basically mean nothing. example also labeled antibiotic free, Good right? Also trick, antibiotics chicken illegal federal level, chicken antibiotic free legally sold US. looks good package!

As question...

A) Buy farm
B) Move rural area buy straight farm visited determined meets personal morals

This world sucks Ah that's that's called! Thank you! calculated voters feel euphoria going back normal reconning hit election 3 weeks.... retorical question? dad went hospital pneumonia this. already tested came back negative. went, still treated like Covid patient isolated him. tested also came back negative, released. test come back positive would kept him. someone would likely get sick covid due age preexisting conditions.

My point is, least hospitals, high likelihood getting really sick this, want keep you. want infect anyone else take turn. Bioterrorists win again. also become normalized everyone store wearing one. look weird don't. Peer pressure motivator. 

Now could get everyone make sure well-fitted enough stay damn nose. yet anytime post something god awful economic impacts lockdowns are, get downvoted told I'm obsessed money. Hundreds. 

Hundreds thousands. guess that's yes, that's really depressing. no, meat production sustainable, going vegan single biggest thing day day life lower emissions. could feed billions people available land everyone went vegan. Thats awesome bud, fronts. Hope things work thanks folks like doing!! wrong, people keep replying comment saying things along lines, assuming I'm saying we've done fantastic job handling blatantly untrue misrepresenting I'm saying.


Getting people follow guidelines related lockdown. That's massive failure administration failing capitalize gain first lockdown period. horrible lost thousands lives it, knowledge base grew TREMENDOUSLY avoided overloaded medical system. always intention, succeeded. bad idiot leader capitalize that.


Now new knowledge incredibly unlikely we'll need lock again. best could been? Fuck no, even portion populace masking/social-distancing likely keep us reaching dangerous point overloaded medical system. sane world, anyone's (but Trump's) fault. children need lied to. pandemic. plan never delusional scenario cases all. would impossible.

Lockdowns conducted countries like China, Vietnam, New Zealand, zero local cases (all cases people flying abroad). would impossible clearly countries pulled off? That’s already “healthcare” system. first detect virus world. scientific consensus first started. Yeah, preventing things getting bad would awesome, everywhere now. could get people lockdown would easy government money rolling in, certainly going happen government holding aid heads threatening give vote right. video represent Sweden times?

looks like typical day sweden people riding subway masks

not sure mean position

and im disputing said said assertion without proof. another reason stay hell away Florida. funny thing guys constantly make newchina look bad talking way even realise it. Cant stop Cain Train baby! I'm sure exactly right. Trump released optics could continue claim virus bad. He's still getting care getting hospital.

If gets better, pretend beat Covid three days. dies, matter he'll dead. Yeah many people ignorant death country. 3 million Americans die every year enough people seem care. Even many people dead every year one seems care, feel like I'm virtuous person left sometimes. are/were intelligent men morals know exactly they're  read write? consume little animal product possible.

I still eat eggs, they're beneficial pass up. replacement. diet already limited enough mildly allergic everything (MCAS).

Good luck taking care EDS/POTS/CP/depression.
It's hard enough walk.

I can, give eggs. They're thing keeping afloat point. one protein tolerate.

Instead going people like already limited options even limited footprint, direct anger towards companies actually ruin earth. pandemic natural disaster. Chinese responsible covid-19 Americans H1N1 enough, H1N1 spreading around world, media seem interested calling ""California virus"" ""American virus"". political leaders blaming America shutting borders prevent spread. 

Strange it? Compared free systems? general? Regardless, I’ll admit hyperbolic state generally bad healthcare system. However ridiculous amount government spending COVID testing/tracking, along side draconian lockdown (and it’s necessary drain economy) certainly come back bite Italy. would argue claim still stands that, Italy’s healthcare system ill prepared handle pandemic. Didn’t enough masks, equipment, staff, space available deal big spike cases. cases countries earth, Italy one them. factors play (the advanced age population one them), stand claim now. try living ND....24 new deaths TODAY alone.  


But worry force close contacts quarantine put mask mandate, etc. Maybe ;-) actually roof vents open breeze. kids wear masks. exception. time critical care paramedic got weeks ago work non profit tissue recovery transplant research. Getting corona touching face still much thing back then. Earth ""gathering data"" change fact wearing masks make people touch face more? Fauci saying science wrong

What makes think wrong right now?

Surely fact Sweden today woods without ever lockdowns, masks, social distancing, went things ended exactly day 1 lockdowns give pause?

Sweden today looking forward economic growth enjoyment life. Meanwhile look forward yet another round lockdowns without expiry date Dang, that’s messed up. wish people weren’t awful trying undercut rules look loopholes every possible turn. 

Are online high quality meat vendors/subscription services verifiably good practices meat sources (livestock truly allowed roam be, animals)? It’s hard know legit, barely scraping lose definition charge maximize profits. sure, know FB communicated since August. send message earlier today, ill ask gets back me. message discussion like.  Jesus, stupid understand differences acts committed foreign governments soldiers war, general quackery, experiments performed race people fucking government beyond help. mean sounds creepy beautiful me, whatever floats boat. says 50-70 percent infections happen households. household consist three people every index case infects two household 67 percent infections happen households. 
But would give household secondary attack rate 100 percent. 

The index case must infected outside household.

Lancet writes household secondary attack rate 12,4 percent. 50-70 percent infections happen households would need households many people living together. Sweden.

Can see absurdly implausibe Tegnells statement is? honestly sympathize agree ways. wish could MUCH smaller government. Leave people alonebas much possible. Let keep much money possible.

 


But since live world do, I've decided settle fight government that's good people governs, even still intrusive bloated. “Embodied” embodies packed Florida stadiums... always Finals. Kick something everyone share in. always Last Game (your) season. ball air... everyone Catch It.

These people literally dying see football. truuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

ugh That’s Trump holding till Dec 1st “Christmas” surprise. way opened schools NYC doesn’t even help childcare. kids whose parents opted get like two days week. Social media posts representative anything. lots crap posted American social media Facebook, Twitter, Reddit. Thanks hate it. They're organized American Institute Economic Research. Hopefully gets way 4 asshole enough waste taxpayer money pleading guilty European Eastern Front fucking crazy general. Insane read 50% capacity, table service only, tables 6 feet apart, maximum party size 6.

Seems reasonable.  This. Door county Chicago folks, go west bay Green Bay everyone chin diapers wear anything N95 masks custom form fitted. come variety sizes. fitted small, medium, large XL. 

Custom fitted N95 masks would incredibly expensive. mean, judging Asian countries reliable data , don’t see doubt numbers

My friends japan pretty much living life normally wearing masks burn kitchen food vicious fight survival breaks leftover scraps, achieve anything pointing broken noses. 

Really, get used it. 

And nice day, going live interesting times. frightening number literally think Trump superhero battling cabal satan-worshipping pedophiles. Lol. cause Herman Cain black republican. They're rare GOP let go.

Happens way to. Crazy lot people show petty authoritarians demand control people. Luckily, nowhere near filling 5000 ICU beds

Looks like they're getting dangerously close considering effective number probably much lower due geographic distribution 2 week lag restrictions take effect. didn’t copy article faculty students sound furious. barely survived confidence vote going revisit it. don’t think pressure going end. can’t tell people break rules without impunity. 

He’s like every leader politician followed rules apply tell everyone else act. Well guess backwards must infected. five says since admitted positive test. That’s true. NY lower % deaths nursing home residents states. many people died early states one knew treat Covid early days. intimated patients early, didn’t know steroids dramatically helped survival rate, didn’t new drugs available today. CCP asked retired PLA members buy masks, deliberate premeditated attempted murder hospital staff countries.

I thought country intel virus November. country specifically send China plane load PPE? popularity contests lead ""electing"" dumb mention lied pathogen order allow time spread countries, allowed international travel. 

You mean like United States global leader covid-19 still allowing international travel never closed international travel? What's see? Double chinese used CCP killing people indiscriminately inside occupied territories mean possible get rest world look way. 

The country indiscriminately kills people occupied territories United States. evidence United States indiscriminately killing people occupied territory. China gets accused country indiscriminately killing people occupied territories indiscriminately killing people occupied territories. nightmare country. Go earn social points somewhere else. 

Did bring social credit scores 2020? program experiment single city China starting 2014 implemented 2020 Western media hyping now... what? happened?

Are going bring ghost cities next? There's three variables one larger two. autism? Yeah, nope. going happen. So, thus far right wear mask even illegal wear mask trumps:
- people’s lives
- literally people’s lives
- right ask customers wear masks private property
- right ask customers leave private property wearing mask
- literally people’s lives *hubris root evil. Moisture particles take several minutes settle. instead happy hour folks shoulder shoulder, 2 rows deep happy hoursl, one row folks shoulder shoulder trying get fill 7 o'clock.

I strong suspicions venn diagram overlap people wear masks, bad tippers, demanding assholes pretty gigantic. may explicitly prohibit ""secession"" - that's bit like saying Bible explicitly prohibit kiddy porn.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hit 19 call ""Trump COVID 19""?

Edit: hit 20? IDK, workshop it. probably hurry. Nah. nothing CDC recommendations. beginning shit show worked health care. would receive directive start shift several shift contradicted other. /tips hat Genuine question here. people sub feel idea Covid Death numbers inflated? sure merit I've heard someone Covid they're eaten shark, counted Covid death. Again, know true know old Peanuts cartoons adult talks? That's trump hears. Whaa whaa trump wha whaaa trump whaa wha wha. matter said. remember Far Side cartoon dogs hearing like also. 

Sorry world view based cartoons. find easier believe reality right now. would give Sanchez portal gun. I'm 100% sure positive covid test. Deaths percentage population (Crude fatality) already 0.3% NYC \~30% infected. 0.3% seems extremely optimistic. Gosh. 

Didn’t see coming. point USA go, yeah we’re done. Yeah, let's tank economy another year. totally negative impacts future. Allahu akbar nazi coming Many Americans don’t paid time off, sick time, shit don’t even health insurance. Trump fucking evil doesn’t give fuck working Americans class worries seems lot people refuse receive vaccine Tbh wouldn’t worrying wearing masks next several months made good, united effort curb disease first place. kept wearing masks, kept regulations unanimous people can’t ‘escape’ state laxer rules.

Honestly, you’re wearing mask, that’s matters me. Stay away people possible, masks best prevention. visit people way.

It’s disheartening hear peers even teachers say ‘who cares anyways, we’ll fine get sick.’ Yea, *you* will, people care elderly don’t want germs. know they’re Trump, they’d better wear damn masks keep away want showing anything. also assume large number people contracted virus little symptoms counted go test. Interesting china went war killed 4000 people Lol Ontario, catch up! -Quebec one thinks masks either big deal wear even awesome way? mouth F rude people worry smiling awkwardly make eye contact random people. make fun! Marvel/sports team/social message. Accessorize folks. Thats get Civil War 2 whole per capita thing eludes people.

It takes kinds make internet, guess. know FIL going super pissed want part Thanksgiving house thinks virus nearly impossible get basically summer cold. virus doesn’t discriminate nearly much guy. on-campus worker. campus closed. So, job. get grants afford tuition + supplies. gig work busy all. Everyone UberEats, DoorDash, InstaCart. can't find research positions internships. worry affecting future.

Internships research opportunities good way build connections, get experience, get foot door. I'm able I'm getting Zoom education.  that, right? 

All want know stop social distancing irrespective facts consequences. hated cleaning pool. Im one bought house pool Dad! Sure, matter one ultimately takes it. release five days early save lives front end early adopters losing lot back end due less total people taking it. 'strategic thumping' matter graduated. matter understanding history. think worse folks Medieval Europe Black Death? ""Oh, that's long past good comparison,"" say. Sure, think worse Spanish Flu 1918?

You technology beyond belief anyone previous history keep busy--videogames, VOD, porn, video games. Amazon sends whatever could possibly want 2-3 days. communicate via several different apps friends world over.

But hey, want go socialize person, risk getting virus? Go right ahead. I'm sure friends skype-zoom funeral.  drop GOP Republican names called Flies. REDDIT MOMENT Trump steroids reminds Charlie Sheen insane burnout telling everyone tiger blood him. Everyone grand Cheetooo deals turns corrupt Czech, point, live constant threat lockdown. time this. Gotta enjoy can. live liberal leaning area. know lot people liberal taking liberties (e.g. traveling, huge social bubbles, sending kids day camps even though work home, lax masks). seem least believe level COVID real. They're taking stance think they're vulnerable.

On flipside, know quite conservatives well. Many flat deniers conspiracy theorists it. educated conservatives know seem largely supportive masks social distancing, wish people would actually adhere measures business could resume. 8 vaccines single visit small child etc heard parents like spread 2 3 visits. Whoever is. Also Stephen Miller now. Thankfully he's latching great I'm pumping get stash. made 20 months first. shooting year time. exhausting rapid tests highly inaccurate depending model, example Abbott rapid local CVS using could miss 48% positives. I’d quarantine, watch coworkers results (if provide them), try get non-rapid test although given length time you’ve sick test may pick (if covid). cringe. I'd love that.
But yep I'm dying hill.
I'd rather risk homelessness serve someone like again. Imagine didn’t vaccine flu. Millions people would get seriously sick flu every year. Many would die.

The flu Covid similar transmissibility, it’s vaccine one don’t other. Wow, I’m Mr. Microsoft! No, wargaming, tabletop games wow look replies Meanwhile Whitehouse still requiring masks employees. tell press many infected. Refused cdc contact tracing.  Again, maybe missing something here... quite evident I'm laughing personal definition word ""mass"" clearly can't seem draw distinction four figure number six figure number.

It takes linde make internet, guess. god World leaders much. Everyone needs considerate others start wearing mask. too. Aside primary purpose, look feel like shit lazy days dreading facing people corner store taking dog walk...mask + sunglasses, voila, semi anonymous. true, would actually worse.

But sounds like poor excuse. Listen. think I’m letting Fauna &amp; Merangue lonely I’m able social another thing coming  can, have. Unfortunately many agencies made critically understaffed, misused, abused. IE: State Department. Lets go far. would settle bit socialism country.

ROFL, say more. Plant based meat par meat, economics scale make cheaper.

Dont forget add $1.70 per $1 sticker actual cost meat. US government gives heavy subsidies industries, including paying lobbies. leader also wants kill voters. see read  Sweden 50x cases Australia Australia's population 2.5 times Sweden's? seems bit strange.

Okay, open everything up. restrictions. really think people would stay business?

They would not. loud are, COVID denying crowd still minority. enough sustain businesses. WAP wishes prayers Christ sucks yall. Sorry hear it. People can't deal reality. Damn.

Actual functioning democracies administrations around globe shown ability keep money people’s pockets shutdowns. realize manufacturers like Powecom making masks American brands like 3M years prior epidemics, right? like magically lose ability make masks slap 3M logo mask. mean take word it, FDA CDC labs actually tested masks many Chinese manfuacturers rely that.

And say true. American companies pay big settlement kill somebody. Chinese CEOs get death penalty products kill. Advisement quarantine =/= outbreak. way. get kill Americans. commended governor strict COVID response mask mandate. People share opinion criminals. thank god NFL right thing protect public health, government isn't.

You're totally right. win. I'm evil murderer there's reason ""pretend care"". Let's burn environment we're it. :)

I'm evil matter suggest there's point, eh? link? I'll send daughter, MD still getting one n95 per month.

Can't white ones, Kn95s. approved ones green. wonder long course Dex (the steroid) is? crash going something dreadful. Can't argue them. Sounds like got dope ass job though. Keep good work hopefully overcome ignorance. Hospitals city around 50% capacity (including people hospitalized non covid related stuff) everyone still screaming ""stay home vaccine"" smh, say anything that's ""stay home indefinitely"" country's subreddit get downvoted hell.

I even got downvoted saying 23 year old 99% chances survival get sick cause people enjoy staying home much wished covid high IFR downvote anyone suggests death sentence. I've never part hospital physicians union. “Our protocol, based CDC guidance, includes colleagues turning N95 masks conclusion shift, receiving another mask beginning next shift.”

So, reusing mask? personal mask, buy pack? really expensive, available. blindly reusing mask, that's reckless patients, basically martyred herself. Lies. Fauci says 400k Americans could die covid.

Back February experts said we'd track 100k end year, worst case scenario, anticipating rational response government. 

By April Trump admin said 200k would absolute worst case scenario end-of-year obvious going anything it. 

We're 215k, 3 months left year winter disease season starting. 

We're already way past worst-case scenario forecasted February, doubling it. mock rest world dream normal life back again.

I go park, mall, beach, bar 7 months.

It's already october. use stock alerts Office Depot/max frequently get 2 packs I’ve ordered there. list cables kits almost always 3M brand stock. [Cables Kits 3M Ripe? even possible claim Sweden done well, beyond me.

Come on, one worst hit countries *entire* world. many downvotes came people idea gain function research BSL 4 lab is?

Per capita, surpasses US.  responsible ANYONE deaths accrued. feelings exactly. I've vegan care factory farming ends, happy see end Use Google please pass whatever smoking  Like Blade said ""Some motherfuckers always trying ice skate uphill."" technical wild chickens wild birds bred become chickens, call wild chickens Source?

I'd like point positive change... number reported cases high April. number new cases per day doubled two weeks. know family whose dad DIED still deny!!!!! That's precedent Hannity well. use one, feel alittle empathy bc brainwashed 24 hour cycle doom covid news.

Use think dumb people could brainwashed till realized was. (Cue many people reading thinking ""haha dumb"" thats would thought 6 months ago)  Maybe it’s safe travel bc hoaxer posts link saying it’s open travel. It’s reasonable keep slaves alive healthy enough work land. keeping optimal health actually good thing makes less likely revolt. pretty old idea dating back Romans, game theory would later bear mathematical models construction tyrannical regimes similarly shows tends work. modern world, many reasons seeming success, least one reasons North Korea continues experience virtually internal resistance regime Pyongyang even labor camps de facto slaves fact population kept largely underfed sick elite segment society loyal citizens higher quality-of-life willing kill rest countrymen maintain status. get China test everyone Wuhan 10 days (11MM people) right going lift quarantine? Pretty crazy although could fudging numbers (which institutions getting pressure administration well we're guilty anyone) obviously something successfully considering country able open without much effect.

I guess real point, even rightfully argue we're testing countries, know also means something fishy going elsewhere bc things better effectively now. matter, thing that's happened many countries. think US high numbers? Massive testing. Yeah, particular hospital known one - not, top - rated hospitals state... Several friends mine worked years, know they’re really big HIPAA compliance, matter are. hadn’t Christie’s tweet, probably wouldn’t know hospital checked into. Right currently value health life time sure targeting individual accomplishes. Maybe we’d successful tried less vicious methods convince non believers? I’m curious know anyone vioewpoints changed based person screaming idiot face. 

Seems like everyone wants bully instead educate. Almost get enjoyment point. think confused lockdowns mean. variety levels lockdown, extreme hunkered house, restaurant operate 25% 75% lockdown capacity. Towns forcing kids virtual learn, lockdown school. black white term, severe restrictions, locked down. Tofu delicious know prepare properly. mom used shit job preparing dinner, hated years. wife showed tofu *should* prepared/cooked, can't get enough. 

I'm convinced people like tofu properly prepared yet. MLB outbreaks early got season fine. deaths, 1 hospitalization (last checked).  mask zero effort

Putting mask leave house taking get home certainly less effort taking every time go leave shop, not? lazy selfish people think donning mask takes 3 seconds effort.  idiots. Nobody feels sorry husband, idiots endangered many lives innocent people. STFU. Yet president claims presidency, he’s taken care veterans president history. I’m appalled. majority American population small guy/gal picking lesser two evils. maybe local politics made accessible average person, maybe comprehensive materials explaining candidate is, maybe day voting. Believe tried, took solid week read everyone, something everyone time do. found local people pocket big developers anyway republican Democrat. greenwashing strong too. mention children need peer contact proper development. Even 6 months huge chunk child's life. schools closed year would disastrous. younger children, worse would be. one changed position. can't because???

""Dear refugee families destroyed Trump, please know feel you. also know feel equal amount compassion man destroyed lives. Good luck!"" fort middle CSA territory gave multiple chances leave peace. It’s clear cut make be.

But yea slavery worst treason don’t really get arms designation reinfection means higher risk becoming hospitalized first time? mean, second time infected worse first time? body prepared take second time? Twitter source “Wedding &amp; Event Consultant”.

Anyone better source? list 44 countries listed, 12 require quarantine. One countries requiring 14 day quarantine UK, covid infection numbers skyrocketing. gave propaganda number. ""That's okay -- we're trying spread purpose here!"" also feel both.

""Dear refugee families destroyed Trump, please know feel you. also know feel equal amount compassion man destroyed lives. Good luck!"" horrible, yet completely preventable, tragedy. farmed pangolins. wild animals, bred poor conditions eaten still fit ""factory farmed"" criteria imho. vulnerable come walks life deserve ""treated equally"".

Nope. Weighing years life left standard practice medical ethics. 

Faced choice saving healthy 20 year old decades left live, frail sickly 85 year old months years left live, doctors would choose former. ""long Covid"" reported left even people mild infections problems fatigue joint pain months.

Postviral syndrome nothing novel shocking: happen flu, even happen something mild common cold. Natural, lasting, protective immunity disease would needed,"" says. ""And know effective long-lasting people's post-infection immunity be.""

We evidence lasting immunity: may disappear within months cells B cells don't. guys tested every day treated early onset symptoms likelihood long term effects extremely unlikely. Plus players kinds (approved) substances would likely counter worst symptoms.  Maybe say article. say still lag behind. imagine hypertension damages blood vessels covid known tobl significantly affect blood vessels well Nope.  
At point clutching onto straws.  


At least others came form argument. Americans basically think countries myth. there's need ponder whether India culling population India media invention.

I exaggerate, barely. really find annoying. understand (to point) trust governement medias, trust doctors people working health ? litterally point lie must really infuriating health professionals deal people. risk infection via surfaces ruled really important route Corona virus. requiring outdoors means people mask fatigue even more, even means get wear masks indoor, matters. someone spit anus...i hate kind situation. Like really. Peoples irresponsible. It’s still misinformation flu anywhere near 100,000 recent history. CDC death estimate influenza influenza complications since 2010

Please let know 210,029 lower anything influenza year...

Please stop repeating lies. Trump always spreading fake news. call President Fake News. would unless KNEW certain people already spreading purpose? Like... Vote allowed sign away liability garden variety negligence.

You allowed sign away liability ‘gross negligence’ Oh. None eliminated it. Dude listen experts I'll give 95%, 5% natural origin.

Accidental leak, planned release. yes, almost certainly. certain came seafood market eh? CCP denies well know. Hate reddit arguments feeling annoyed yesterday. Call name want dont care.

Use flaming liberal kinda june year realized brainwashed lied was. media enemy got hooked nothing say change that.

How media reported covid march-june like world ending 2 weeks act like covid doesnt exist protests/riots. cooled down, right back Covid doom. bad covid MIDDLE ""PANDEMIC"" hundreds thousands people gather together media cool even fanning flames create violence. 

Look you, mad media enemy got tricked thinking im enemy. Exactly want. Hopefully wake like one day, takes lot self evaluation people cant that. Goodluck life, youre gonna need confused democrat 1000000% sure right. us that，wining wars。
this POTUS cant know several different places go online buy fresh N95s right now.

Yep. Ebay whole time (overpriced $5-$10 piece, nothing doctor's salary). Although medical professional might want avoid ebay potentially getting fake.

Recently saw real 3M contractor's N95's (the ones unfiltered exhale valve) $3 piece construction industry supply website anyone order from. He’s accused sexual assault numerous women pays aren’t forcing anyone anything, experts expert opinion something shouldn’t jailed it, can’t believe say this. saying number people dying much higher previous averages lying. 


ok. know many people lost sense smell spring fever, get test. 

The real number cases deaths COVID likely lot higher us would guess. incentive grow businesses multi million dollar range good way maintain improve economy. pay 38% income tax. make good amount income, didn’t surpass millions working alone. pay 23 people little continued education 100k year. believe success leads employees success. Wealth tax breaks don’t get excessive you’re making tens millions year. paid shy $800,000 taxes last year. wrong seems me, it’s easy someone trying expand share wealth jealous. don’t hoard money, spend love need. government ZERO say money goes. pork roll. oh christ(ie), forget one? Oh He's denied essence COVID, video clip showed. Yes, donuts around pit fire instead Every lie tell incurs debt truth. Well, vaccinate everyone antibodies last six months, give everyone booster six months later, we'd good chance limiting spread far now. also feel both.

I think makes bad person choosing though.

Edit clarity case - using 'you' general sense saying someone's body producing enough virus detectable test producing enough virus infect others? I'd like source please. can't because??? Oh. think people lie COVID death tolls trusted. 

Different strokes, guess. Less fat sugar, fish oil, smaller dose. Every society comes theory. Israel, believe Netanyahu orchestrating avoid legal troubles.

Conspiracy theories coping mechanism develops naturally response existential terror. idea right cloud viral particles away death impossible swallow people. orchestrated powerful unseen force, everything still someone's control, that's comforting. Becoming doctor much, much work repeating things. 

You smart areas idiot others. Ben Carson, example. Amazingly brilliant surgeon. Pretty much imbecile every facet life. I'm keto even low carb (which like 100 grams carbs day), though I've drastically cut back carbs. I'm 45% carbs, 25% fat, 30% protein right now. dietitian working combine them, like eating carbs own, eating better quality carbs. helped sure. Remember supposed top 60k surpassed like 5 weeks later? one, Covid probably hospitalized people past six months strain Influenza past 10 years, that's US. Shitty analogy.

We know possible eat meat without causing pandemics. Maybe amounts we're eating right now, hardly necessary 100% planet go vegan either.

By logic might arguing humans existing also causes pandemics, get rid humans. Urban populations much susceptible pandemics due high population density, mean get rid major cities?

Plant foods cause cases mass poisoning bacteria too, nobody argues getting rid plant foods, argue increasing food safety standards fact well known even detrimental survival since causes many heart problems people.

No doesn't, please get date science. good quality studies showing meat causes heart disease, except uncontrolled correlational studies. fact, link eating meat heart disease thoroughly debunked controlling relevant factors, like eating junk food exercising.

Excess sugar junk food ones causing heart disease. see contradicting original statement? conservatives already starting argue recent spate prominent Republican diagnoses part poisoning campaign Deep State operatives, least two's experiences changed tune. Lol Trump still can't breath hardest days virus ahead him. fight shit yet. country live in? country checking see what's new virus? Experts charged murder forcing people go world GLOBAL PANDEMIC occurring virus likely kill anything else. 

Its disagreeing thats problem, problem need face consequences lives cost. opinion wrong. sorry sarcasm hard detect US. ebbs waves like stadium. Good idea. also, eating meat binary choice. factory farming bothers you, worried climate change, still want meat nutrition enjoyment, reduce meat consumption. decide level. 2 people cutting meat intake half good one person switching vegetarianism. ""next year"" ""a year away"". ""A year away"" implies twelve months away, whereas that's months away. Two weeks isolation hotel room tho. know several people moving back Taiwan China UK go back normal life, right live I'd probably it. Exactly..

I'm going walk bar next gun store redneck community start shit masks, city, neighborhood, I'll keep voicing concerns long safely can.
 
I'm sorry experience work. continue remind world mouth unsanitary end tunnel, maybe day succeed stigmatizing bare face holes. WH claims he's longer Hope gets ""miracle dugs"" Trump got /s movie something escaping containment running wild whatever crew there, killing them...

Who could ever predicted covid would stop production? shemagh, I've worn it, like 1000's serviceman who've spent time desert. religion required.

Edit: lol, yes, please mask home 24×7, hooga Booga dance insulting preferred religious victims.

Edit2. I've always partial samurai masks myself, maybe I'll make like that, ghost tsushima. Products ranches farms used available local consumption. United States places process food level contamination food always news. So, what’s 83.4 oC Barbarian? I've thinking lot this. ever know anything close accurate count service workers got directly White House? [Twitter's policy impersonation applies normal like policies. Dead Herman Cane still tweeting? 🙂 thank you, jesus, I'm glad life microscope. god forbid ever make mistake. deaths world since wear masks? Reddit told masks important thing ever.   Classic /r/FloridaMan stupidest thing I’ve ever read. believe. essentials. Working home, socializing via video chat, etc. going inside businesses. real reason take chance, long time. already voted... Italy makes face ☹

Masks mandatory. 

Prolongs covid.

State emergency! like colleague, one hand gloved picking food stuff phone wallet, sanitizer bottle car. also correlate almost perfectly areas voted opposition Numbers increase 24 hours. . Le taux de personnes contaminées bondit dans le bilan publié mercredi soir par Santé Publique France, avec **18.746 personnes testées positives au Covid-19 dans les dernières 24 heures, contre 10.489 mardi soir.** Le dernier chiffre aussi élevé date de samedi, avec 16.972 cas recensés en une journée. En tout, 653.509 personnes ont été contaminées depuis le début de taux de positivité des tests continue de grimper, en passant de 9% mardi à 9,1% ce mercredi. Il était de 8,6% ce lundi.

**Wednesday evening: 18,746 positive tests (9.1% total tests positive)**

**Tuesday evening: 10,489 positive tests (9% total tests positive)** Lol, think White House bothered that? 😂  biological disease. society less open seeing deaths/cases place open. way around. Maybe get double mask mandate like can, get tizzy it? would adding foods enjoy repertoire bad? hard accept possibly prepared ""wrong"" (for tastes) like many us before. explicitly elaborate can't assume either way... might well play safe. compulsory field trip high schoolers.

Best know facts behind consume make choices based that.

I still eat meat btw though factory farming level US. Tube diameter 0,5 mm achieve rapid heat exchange.

For cooking, remember thermal flux relevant measure.
Air 800x times less dense water.
High oven heat need minutes half hour sterilize contaminated surface, hot water seconds. I’m perfectly willing pay lot meat, eat lot less meat, factory farming eliminated. it, boys! homestretch!! people can’t understand basic common sense logic, people studies like this. God’s work, were! access great healthcare best court system world. 

But choose seek vice, unprotected fornication liberal ideas end poor brown think lying plexiglass protecting workers almost every office making covid19 secure /s They're normal life we're believe want.

USA 2020 GDP - 2020 GDP - suggest start learning Mandarin soon. looks like Nova Scotia lockdown March.

They got control, never ~700 active cases, masks enough, considering could completely shutdown travel.

They island population 1m people.

If get full cooperation restrict travel, short shutdowns sufficient. much theory BLM protests started huge outbreak. wear mask indoors public buildings, avoid large gatherings, distance possible. Still going stores, restaurants, etc. likely 100% able treat trump White House. 

The government fuck around comes protecting president. 

Still, expect head back Walter reed within week. Also every server, cleaner, PA, secretary, clerk, baggage handler, passerby, offspring?

\#freeclaudia 🤣 sports teams often feel like refs biased them. Great Wall? That’s first thing thought. really call Trump virus since directly indirectly spread probably known person world.  say ""we""?

Do put category unethical immoral?

The vast majority research past present better. 

To focus one incidents past generalize racist.

Dr Sebe widely trusted shared among black Americans, yet 100% fraud. Sorry - rant. 

Hate right helpful. right thing saying something despite knowing others lash react negative ways act best interest everyone. Trying unite common good save lives, chip away pandemic save many possible listen. Many people alive right may otherwise heard facts, maybe would believed half-cobbled together political spinning falsity. 

The virus nightmare situation happen country large population willfully ignorant deniers. SARS virus nothing like bout typical seasonal flu people get week go back normal. Hundreds thousands people young old going disabled rest lives, many die later much sooner never quite heal damage.

I really wish newspaper would stop playing saying mild. people read may think ""Oh well okay! back normal? lockdown? lockdown mild."" media makes statements tells people small percentage old people actually getting sick. Even mild case covid-19 debilitating people ages getting ill. reason belief children get children giving everybody else, especially teachers parents.

Hospital bills hundreds thousands people could climb millions. people can't even afford ambulance trip get hospital - could trips needed years progressive long-term damage Covid-19 causes scar tissue heart lungs. years go person may prone reinfection common things existing scar tissue. head cold linger longer go straight pneumonia. Anti inflammatory medicines like steroids manage lung conditions cause Diabetes complications.

Later cause needed trips specialists, cardiologists, respiratory therapists, pulmonologist, internists, radiologists - people kind resources. Rural people can't travel get care easily. Even best hospital coverage bills catastrophic. USA many states Medicaid insurance adults little income (TX one comes mind. Even people cancer denied.) initial infection likely unemployment many can't work jobs lung damage. extremely high medical prescription bills years. (Edited typos.) case, accept sacrifice. Yes almost make sound like natural assumption world flat. TBH, really ever stop. Pears* say. Romania locked hard early 300 cases per day peak 6 months 3000. point another lockdown work. one going take lockdown seriously protest loophole. People ""protest"" gather. 🤦‍♀️ Add pretty much every country list. Except guideline-not-follower chief followers. many times roll eyes? mom seems simultaneously take seriously think hoax. wears masks limits contact, even scare went hospital July, yet weeks ago inserted conversation thinks go away November 3rd. asked thinks said go cook dinner. conversation took place text message. Yes thousand 60 million worldwide healthcare workers. Great Barrington Declaration based one would hope could happen, realistically executed. far scientific norm. Well current strategy trying separate everyone simply isn’t sustainable. think they’re looking realistic approach doesn’t involve criminalising basic human needs social behaviours. “It would’ve 2 weeks 330 million people didn’t stay inside 2 weeks” us, unfortunately. removed comment liberal sub quit kidding could densely populated? Taking public transport? WFH jobs? Sharing crowded flat? Food deserts? ESL? think chemtrails turn gay frogs, COVID minor comparison. Parody ? meant neighbor :) This!!! saving guy? should’ve closed bridge  Yeah, supervisor let pass. Follow policies, leave. Heck, could get offered remote position? Otherwise, find new job! want give antivaxxers real ammo cause? point is: told ""You put things proportion maintain real meaning, like deaths per million.""

In list 150 countries, 141 performing better US metric asking for. So, point?

And way: chosing UK prime minister downplaying covid-19 long time (until hospitalized actually), cherry picked again. ignoring fact countries better US?  That's exactly it. Besides, people already refusing adhere safety guidelines (and believe group spreading most) Covid fatigue going start now. also don’t wanna create antivaxxers... last thing need vaccine harms ppl idiots explode. I’m glad I’m one mentality. Seeing someone’s bare face become shocking thing me. 

I work eye doctor patient come earlier pick glasses. sat across dispensing table could put glasses make sure line up. considering whether get face shield put mask this. She, hand, sat immediately pulled mask down. It’s like said, like staring face face bare asshole utterly disgusted. hesitation told keep mask inside office, ESPECIALLY sitting face face two feet front me. huffed looked offended put back left rest time here. 

100% people going whatever let get away with. story completely fucked hope guy spends rest life jail won’t let discourage calling people every time feel it’s safe so. reason us it. Mr Badass old man murderer wouldn’t felt tough person called 40 years younger. That's like 90,000 day Murica units. wear masks required don’t go parties large events (not happening) largely living normally. Playing contact sports, eating occasionally, friends etc much wish would use chance, fact unfortunately person can't change heart one. Christie really bad bout Covid survives, feel like he’ll change tune talk devastating need take serious. 

I’m basing 2012 behavior, spent year blasting Obama election season, praising Obama’s response hurricane Sandy days leading election. 

But still, would shocked 2020 Christie comes toxic douchey everyone else Trumpworld though.  Oh will, it’s take longer. immune. He's still rich still tight orbit around US President (where caught all). pride feel paying bill treatment recover immeasurable. Haha literally far gone, enjoy living bubble proud of! competent government would proper support place help businesses get it. Instead, totally incompetent trump admin gave stimulus packages companies need (but run donors) gaslighting public corona bad. think also include hospitalization dates Cain. don’t think Cain home cheerfully saying getting better right? hospitalized time Death still laging tho comparison (well 80 today, would 300 US? quiet day Sunday ) seems likely could sufficiently disrupt air exchange way allows viral particles linger.

That makes sense me. Droplets large enough stopped plexiglas barriers fall floor within 30 seconds dont hit barrier. dont linger unless aerosols aerosols air everywhere every store. And, think stores exchange inside air outside air, fantasizing. Stonks go down...? Stonks gods angry, must sacrifice essential workers! Make stonks go up! Good. Good. problem everyone goes &amp; re-socializes, especially office settings, 50% capacity quickly fill 90%+ occupancy. hospital system designed many pneumonia/flu-like cases, especially ICU. Covid cases quickly crowd life-threatening illnesses. literally happen within 4 6 weeks re-opening. hard public health officials open covid dams without flooding entire region. Remember there's really precedence 100 years. basically experiment progress. sympathy. None. world better without people like this. high risk group apparently, Republicans get vaccine first dr.drew said I'll stick mask mandates public December 31, that, fuck it. Fight want. multiple studies proven range even seasonal flu. Blame history that. Assuming immunity lasts long project, we'd probably close herd immunity then. I've already bought concert tickets April I'm ballpark we'll closer normal normal. Time tell. spreading negative sentiment based false information. wrong you? Hard enroll enough it’s voluntary trial. head gave 10 upvotes Yea feel people missed huge life milestones won’t ever get opportunity back. I’ve also mentioned kids played football sport lives, hoping get college scholarship even someone college senior year playing, praying hard work pays make NFL/NBA etc—-and last spring (and even fall lot places country still) whole life’s work high school college seniors could gone drain longer allowed play.

I’m saying shutdowns weren’t warranted back spring. people think keep society another year without truly destroying lives ways besides death, clearly aren’t capable looking situation angles. FDA guidelines already ridiculously light. companies already worked FDA get extremely light testing protocols, trump butt try fuck up.

None companies happy trump guarantee happy gone. Biden bought easily, go rails nonsense injects politics settled issue. Even title believe 😂😂 !remindme 10 years He's wrong though. Essential workers 20 years away next 9/11 firefighters, abandoned dead It’s fine take government funded helicopter private medical suite new experimental treatment. guys freaking ?  like ""escape NY"" time covid leaving escapees Get real. Unless mask N95 N90 effective, worth much. mask worth even less. Kiss toads, look N95 anywhere world.

There reason buy KN95, Chinese mask comes Russian Roulette warranty. Exception... desperate like gamble.

Forget anti-microbial malarkey. virus, microbe. Microbes may 3 microns larger. virus 1 micron.

The masks catch large particles hit stick cloth. holes cloth, every layer, rare, rare, rare exception allow 1 micron aerosols pass right through. wants chance infect Democrats. He's evil like Trump smarter, go get fucked. hero America needs. man depending live likelihood youll encounter one whos actually positive extremely low. dont massive events. Go Hinge bumble go hike somewhere one. automod best :(  Masks annoying people like see facial expressions. I'll wear mask necessary lot people tired seeing them. part study actually. also weird flex access music never lower cost point. like....listen it.

Like pride eclectic tastes imagining artists make stuff like growing pre-internet seeking genre blends....I can't even imagine. CDs like $15 90s? things **can** work insane

If ""can't force me"" attitudes reason worked, **can** work places ppl cooperate.

In NY:

1. enforced shutdown. defied lost business license. 

2. state government police public health power, *made happen.*

3. Supreme Court strike immediately *ever.*

4. NYS borders porous hell, yet shutdown ended, another outbreak. trend line stayed dead flat 4 months. Here's why: Cooperation works mask wearing well shutdowns. And, leader.



...buddy. That's interesting hear qualify unemployment. aware that. would still expect qualifying / applying / receiving payment tough 2 weeks yes - course - fact others may pass die. person they're counting buy bullshit. Huh. introvert, genuinely feel sorry you. family members would guess extreme extroverts energised people. bad student live mother. also find interacting people ibternet makes bit easier. face face interactions helps somewhat. would “enthusiastic” wearing masks? understand people wear necessity would enthusiastic wearing uncomfortable mask. west really need watching Iran. seem like canary coal mine. surge, surge US.

Haha least 4 months. tennis elbow sidelines weeks, damn feels nice shape rich understand that, fair that's reasonable. society government allow rich people fail. current president great example. somehow allowed multiple attempts rebuild, either shady loans tax fraud. touched debate, think fair point, allowed people writing laws. Yeah, fuck considering humanity whole instead alone, I'm obviously wrong.  people elderly don’t quarantine people actually risk? yes, is. names missing? lmk, want make sure accurate Oh wow. is. appears flurry activity subsided. one many problems system. like going back time, peasants king gueens etc. hope getting PTO, needs exposed.

They working arses trying job serve American people despite setbacks provided evil White House. think rest world would like president stage authoritarian coups democratically elected leftist leaders, would start. Pretty liberal I’m level headed enough know sometimes gotta comply shit greater good definitely breaking point. trynna party drink . want fun , blows man Well, I've seen known many people attended house parties, organized birthday celebrations like. Buenos Aires, city.

There's whole-ass country outside Buenos Aires, y'all know? I've seen crowded bars public squares almost every single day I've gone buy groceries city. I'm also surprised using La Matanza example. one place argentinian redditors hate anything else world.  controversial Michigan. Facebook post mother two-month old passed away claims state misclassified child’s death. baby severe birth defect, happened also COVID. medical examiner’s report says baby died birth defect, summary line baby died COVID, isn’t accurate.

There lot follow-up articles find online. Essentially, media confirmed mother’s child two-month old passed away serious birth defect also COVID, wasn’t cause death. It’s unclear child health department referring to, lot news articles surprising. Many medications side effects, people mental illness increase dosage also greatly increasing risk. enough funding studying long term effects meds, essentially using vulnerable friends family members guinea pigs.

I'm absolutely pill-shaming anyone. Mental illness take away person's right decide body. pain major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, C-PTSD, mental illness greater risk physical illness years, society one ashamed, person chooses take medication. US currently 215,712. (my post day yours)        
.    
Looking combat deaths....    
.        
214,938 Americans died combat Civil War. (so we've surpassed this)      
   
291,557 Americans died combat WW2.    
(both conflicts 4 years).    
    
.    
(I think numbers right).     
    
.   
So figure 95 days surpass WW2 combat deaths assuming 800 deaths per day average.    
 
    
.     Looks like Thanksgiving via zoom, year.  God fucking hate this, want live life..... makes two us suck  pussys like won’t say anything it’s internet think we're point focus risk rest us go back normal “stop generalizing people” 

“not complaining feel free generalize me”

choose one now. world follows Trump's advice take cautionary measures, surely even comment literally nothing comment responded to. Dems trying pass bills *months*. GOP refused anything. facts. wrong. people like get asses kicked daily basis That's totally fine, dramatically putting masks face somebody far 6 feet away, glaring others contempt disgust, saying nasty shit others masks absolutely okay, gather lot people issues with.

ALSO okay, somebody far away nature trail looking something, wearing mask, okay approach them. I'm sick happening, go nature people, can't submit 6 feet rule point wearing dumb mask. remember said would last beginning mid 2021. don’t think take anymore pushing back pushing back. Honestly. I’m numb outcry PPE medical professionals. don’t wish harm anyone world’s advanced (expensive) health care system can’t take care help.
I can’t afford good healthcare people around can’t afford either. say medical professional get shrug.
I find difficult sympathetic.

Also. wood work. Fuck lungs guess. handle occupational hazard give chance handle mine. hoarding resources giving mine. I’m accountable health, for-profit employer is. october rough business, online school grinding people down, shitty election coming up, places even celebrating halloween, rip yet, Pence want protective divider debate (source: good point. ""LaW OrDRder!!!"" OK, cool. first, cops &amp; politicians. Fucking hell. Imagine another soccer season attendance. 97% 3 people dead every hundred. 99.75% 2.5 people every 1000. 

That number gets way higher flatten curve. 

Not mention moving goalpost comment. understand upset lead endanger people. suspect unpaid. lol Yes, might wipe diseases too. never get deplorables agree plan sensible that. basically Russian Vaccine? mean I'm surprised saying later. think it'll probably permanent thing rest lives. I'm massive pessimist. thought virus could infect live subjects. /s wonder getting paid time off, Trump gets VIP healthcare asshole. don’t understand I’d need wear mask social distance I’ve vaccine? Get Maybe not, smoking cause non-smokers get fatal illnesses second-hand smoke smoking kills millions year, support ban cigarettes? weird marketing good still legitimate shot Biden? makes feel bad biden, lil  sorry man suffering illness, wish painful health issues human, even kind ghoul separates babies mommies puts people concentration camps. care, people still want vote him. honestly understand how. Unless they've rerouted remaining brain cell power basic functions like walking breathing critical thinking unavailable. Right? specifically belonged rally? I'm house...

I'd heard reporting snobs loving quarantine love crapping people genuinely feel sad fun things we're missing already miserable people hated life anyway. There's evidence anything said S&amp;P500 growth 5.5% last 9 months, Jeff Bezos beat market 5x. 

A growth 27% 9 months equal 35% annual growth exceeds 95%+ hedge funds - that's average growth curve. Trump feels 20 years younger less week. come back even stronger.  How's Austria time year?

I'm interested visit. makes think half Americans stay invincible teenager phase lives.  think science changed significantly, key difference knowing long time getting hit pre-emptive (kind of) lockdowns people wearing masks (as much possible). Tho, know US isnt best example this.

Here Sweden killed seasonal flu way earlier normal, social distancing (we didnt even proper lockdown). knew coming got started social distancing pretty fast. 

common sense tring avoid getting infected, seen, everyone shares sentiment little hope corporations ever right thing own, fact need elect moral good leaders moving forward corrupt businessmen No, Costa Rican aren’t desperate... yet least. live life full privilege's may honesty believe never victim. Plus people US think meat basically going die. ""WhErE GeT pRoTiEn?"" flu vs covid mortality comparisons yesterday seeing incredibly stupid tweet (crazy, know).

Worldwide, based numbers WHO, covid little 45x much 100x lethal flu. that's based reported numbers estimates even full year covid. Flu deaths annually vary LOT, estimated 290k 650k around world, depending year. As...

More people United States died already coronavirus died influenza past five flu seasons combined.

Here's look numbers: The first person known died coronavirus United States died Feb. 29, according Johns Hopkins University. Seven months later, 210,000 Americans dead. Remember, “typical” flu season runs 7 months, October April.

According CDC estimates, many Americans died flu recent seasons:

2019-2020: 22,000 (preliminary)

2018-2019: 34,000 (preliminary)

2017-2018: 61,000 (preliminary)

2016-2017: 38,000

2015-2016: 23,000

2014-2015: 51,000

2013-2014: 38,000

2012-2013: 43,000

2011-2012: 12,000

2010-2011: 37,000

About 178,000 people died five flu seasons running 2015 2020, 210,000 people died coronavirus year. don’t want people make mistakes err judgment. go without saying. needn’t argue point. People will, though, matters handle do. That’s point. 

This isn’t dam break, though. It’s ongoing series dams breaking. people saying, “I like you, wrong,” clearly delivering message value skeptics, don’t speak up, absolutely screwed. need people like speak perspective shared mistaken masses. “I skeptic longer skeptical this” extremely potent powerful message save lives. would absolute fools focus initial mistake right desperately need stop dams breaking.  like auto accidental cancer 

Big true Yes, that's run process get trial. That's also *volunteers* forcing random people it. already every time car. Driving kills people Covid probably stay home find cure car accidents.  Obviously you’re wrong.
I remember Bezos started selling books everyone said Barnes Noble would quickly destroy keep prices high. Israel though u/ObnoxiousLittleCunt early mourn tbh. Save time Covid. It’s mild statistic Confederates American traitors extent Americans British traitors. willing bet likely thought Trump everyone around getting tested frequently. WhiteHouse conceded haven’t testing every day like reported prior. 

Or ignorant arrogance. guys seriously suggesting killing someone rich ??? let die comprehension spotty - *""It appears symptoms result hospitalized""*.. seems pertinent. I’m wondering feels drown ignorance? warm? Cold? didn’t bring damn floaties. follow sports, US sports league enacted extreme measures combat covid outbreak still maintain play. 

The NFL decided little rapid testing paying price. people United States died already coronavirus died influenza past five flu seasons combined.

About 178,000 people died five flu seasons running 2015 2020, 210,000 people died coronavirus year. hit nail head. Us people reddit tend make broad assumptions people history whole wealth human perspective fingertips. People lived 160 years ago internet, ***could*** read access many varying opinions perspective current events. know grown with, hard understand many young men would follow ideal know inherently wrong.

You even look history observe phenomenon, plenty people alive today grew taught things certain way changed views better decades later. information access upbringing incredibly important shaping worldview morality. protecting like they're now. There's several options, delivery, curbside pickup, someone else go you, etc. I'm someone immunocompromised asked wear mask around them, would nice it. Honest question, people immunization can't take vaccine flu season? Lmao idiot. family Shanghai, nephew back in-classroom schooling past month sue administration going way make sure regulations watered enough prevent facilities operating safely. remember exact details case (I've since quit hospitals failure protect us 2 patient care staff died found great job transplant industry) demographic worked pretty high occurrence COPD. never doctor first place probably caused harm help. bet - regulatory affairs people ones author keep track tons paperwork go submission Agency (FDA).

If group finger pulse regulatory submissions going trade organization. others ([one ton detail embedded Excel sheets).

Others run regular 'news' organizations woefully incomplete and/or kept up-to-date. top journalists often background get nuances. understandable fooled, even seasoned professionals like TPM's Josh Marshall revelation similar yours. go crazy see many people falling Lucy's football, saying ""but maybe *this* time..."" Even testing daily, rapid tests relatively high chance false negatives. cells remain much longer. Since old sick majority dying haulers going trough miserable time everything's fine right? unsympathetic, condescending way look things. Let's hope someone close deal health financial problems plague caused. Hang on, thought people agreed probably got virus bat? family member ended fucking me

raised_eyebrow.jpg never suggested masks solved everything. stated Denmark never catch Sweden. Sweden’s deaths likely rise due low mask usage. true. killed tested positive dead....there's difference. Whats super wild fact 300,000 Americans die obesity every year there's almost talk it. Besides reasons mentioned, neighborhoods crime safety issue. Grocery store owners afraid shoplifting robbery, police ineffective, can't afford private security. Sorry rainbow bridge closed.  thing happening countries good education, (Switzerland) included... :) worst conspiracy theorists know highly educated people. must psychological factors play. many people need die take seriously?  400K?  600K? 800K?   0.5% 330million 1.65 million.  That's lost WWI,WWII, Civil War Vietnam Korea - combined.

Please remember old people - despite old - still much want stay alive.  may many years now, write quickly. one soon enough. Would appreciate written pretend future president actually good job?  doubt it. Yeah mean Trump probably best healthcare medication, possibly world, still don’t think he’s great. people going stop pretending lockdowns causes suffering? not, come countries promised lockdown again? come dont lockdowns solve societal problems?

This say lockdowns arent called scale, Sweden much closer Norway Spain Norway terms ""strictness"" example. 

Im also saying Swedens approach right one atleast considered suffering caused strict lockdown. part disease.

Their dumbassery, COVID, course. Woah, we're halfway tax dollars also go towards literally every thing else government does. really good argument. attract think. 
If think billion dollar matter , bother Bezos cheetos it. impossible ignorant virus point... ignorant learned something. fully stupid ignoring information choosing convenient narrative. mainly meant type 2 that, indeed avoidable lifestyle dietary changes. Type 1 indeed autoimmune disease, largely treatable it, least symptoms? Covid not, well. That's critical point statement. overwhelm hospitals covid patients, diabetics would die, nature diabetes ruining immune system making susceptible virus first place. 

Again, main point linking diseases/conditions/disorders they're largely treatable treatment available symptoms, We're still unknown Covid, that's makes especially threatening. hard replicate since soundstage much much smaller standard 5.1 7.1 receiver enough. thought could get away without adding /s that. agree, individual wealth becomes ridiculous even millions Oh, well that’s fine then. Everyone knows staff don’t count. seen things pathetic Christie's bootlicking Tulsa Doom (aka Donald). He's like abused dog. dies, TD never even acknowledge it.

I’m 100% agreement. Christie, would’ve walked away Donald long time ago. Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, Republican who’s good job staying grounded reality antagonizing Trump. Seriously, obscure non-sense conspiracy theory. mean conspiracy theories like ""Did know prominent figure died 1885 replaced look alike!"" great, whatever, super fascinating Bill, thanks sharing. relatively harmless like evidence 1885-era body double easy come one way other.

But thinking something dominating entire global news cycle, killing hundreds thousands, fundamentally altering day day lives... politics? sort conspiracy? fucking stupid?  Like debate infected president wearing mask. Pretty sure it’s arrested development reference. Yet controlled government way intrusive wearing mask. know always give benefit doubt. I'm always thinking ""there's way he's actually dumb"", I'm proven wrong time. anyone know what’s going China moment. Couldn’t really find anything online. control now? things still bad? Try declare President RetreadRoadRocketland see goes. government ignore you’re still bound laws. Trump fire FDA head override them?  nations pretty poor amount population density first world countries, comparing first world countries second third world countries irrelevant. comparative sign success belongs Germany. 

I'm really interested wasting time someone obviously agenda can't see things clearly level headed. Except cause covid, much people want hear, China care. last 100 years viruses like Sars, covid, etc.... started there. people can't understand sometimes.... equal So, he’s got bad shape, right? tweets updates since Saturday?? Know else overused...?

YO MOMMA.........jokes. People hear ""virus"" forget China.

Long lasting negative affects entire generations people kinda MO. matter lead-based paint children's toys ""oops"" viral lab. better job reopening schools district hasnt opened schools yet? Thanks insight. I'll definitely trust searching us. Reported incivility I'm obese. decades. I've diagnosed Binge Eating Disorder. hard, done gastric bypass I've done lots things. Right I'm working therapist dietitian initial luck, like addictions, hard maintain progress made.

Unlike smoking alcohol addictions, can't avoid food entirely Binge Eating Disorder.

The vast majority people overweight know tried many, many thing find something help lose weight maintain loss. I've always felt someone 50 pounds overweight, might able learn eat healthier foods overeat whatever. someone 100+ pounds overweight, belief mental illnesses involved. 

People say lack discipline willpower. every aspect life disciplined hard-working. one aspect really hard brain definitely playing role this.

**Edit add:** I'm also gallivanting maskless people maskless myself. I'm going grocery store pharmacy that's it. sad. Many neighbors making masks giving away.
If knew. That’s good. I've lost like 3+ stone last years. many faults doubt 'serious underlying mental health conditions inability discern reality'. I'm sure fully aware risks decided take anyway. He's dealing consequences long stretch suggest serious mental health conditions. said never affects anyone else. does. society depends childcare ? bad move, else get little people back work? dad like that. far sees, pandemic total sham orchestrated shadowy organizations. 

So every try attack new medical fact news research prove wrong. work.

These people read news ""doctors"" explain fake everything is. youtube full shitty misinformation propoganda. Every fact show already seen got fake explanation for. really new fact, dismiss fake propoganda.

There fighting them. surprising really. something stupid flat earth flourish despite common, 500 years old knowledge, stand chance anything. United States Great Britain also slaves. People act like Confederacy ever slaves, far truth. true reddit’s agenda full shills says: WeAr mAsK KaReN Lol. don’t know Madrix is, looks like dig deep “facts”. Try reputable source. Mayo Clinic. go.  Enjoy actual facts!  stop Sweden. New Zeland many places far better US. Mainly took seriously early don’t actual plan top.  Freaking sad.  And, young really don’t need Mayo Clinic tell millions die.  use people have, “common sense”. 200k+ died. open without mask mandate, seriously don’t think $1m + die!??? Damn. will! don’t seem give shit. That’s framing sad. One life lost isn’t acceptable let aline hundreds thousands millions!  feel sad hardened heart much that’s acceptable. Would love debate actually address reality loss life means something you. Otherwise, nice day.  Based infection fatality rate far maximum death toll probably pass 1.5M. German here, got lots corona dumbasses, too.

They call ""lateral thinkers"" go demonstrating streets such.

Stupidity universal. happened luck leaders, though, numbers look bit better. We've wearing masks months now, course trick far already see numbers climbing thanks colder weather... Winter's gonna harsher usual. would call someone repeatedly lied countrymen fomented division hate solely solidify power, creating multiple negative outcomes, tangible 200,000 deaths? wife done lockdown leaving lockdown city/state permanently.

Can't wait, one month left endure non-living. Zoom social interaction.

We moving completely new place 3000kms away know nobody Covid, lockdowns.. normal life.

It's going cost fortune really pay 14 days Quarantine arrival feel worth need start living again.

Who else chosen relocate escape lockdowns?

We form lockdown since March real end sight.

Along 5 million citizens city, subject harshest lockdown laws world like least couple months, I've lost track every day blends next:

* visitors allowed
* Mandatory masks wearing everywhere, even walking alone rural areas.
* travel 5kms home
* Can't leave home except 4 reasons - medical, groceries, essential work 2 hours exercise
* Everything closed socialising, pubs, clubs etc. except supermarket, doctors similar
* Even playgrounds beaches closed here
* recently nightly curfew allowed leave home 8pm 5am almost restrictions Germany, cinemas open even concerts made (with distance course). 150 people private events may much. current outbreaks parties, August return travellers. Next article: Dr Fauci dictates life even MLB still way NFL Tell keep us americans cant shit together. Yes, court approval types people shame others things like decision wear mask, career basically beholden way perceive you. Wear mask shunned left never liked right thinks wimp? might enough someone roll dice COVID take risk. would think valuable players would protected. Maybe that’s possible football?  imagine bought BS everyone around Trump Trump tested daily. 

I convinced Trump basically never tested unless contact tested positive. see wanting anything nose flat refusing test ""no one around could possibly it"".  several cases reported people thought fake caught it, even died etc. think fake convinced this, work conspiracy theory say skeptics who've realised wrong actually actors pretending behalf big bad evil virus fakers. Even article one comments 'more lies.' refuse believe, absolutely refuse it.  Mostly asses. They're claiming 6% something deaths accurate. They're saying grand conspiracy every hospital doctor nation lying cause deaths.... Death numbers huge too? No. 
Herd Inmunity? Yes. So, push agenda wednesday then?

Great. need ban purple cars reduce risk future pandemics. Cynic isn’t right word... skeptic, maybe. Exactly. Either Christie grasp serious situation is, he's unconscious doctors behave like doctors, rather reality tv stooges. guess so, yes. smoke die, 50 others highly contagious. Similar examples include car accident also highly contagious therefore we're allowed drive cars. Herman Cain would like tweet you. like? vaccine putting end fairy tale, become endemic way distributed among population, necessary except vulnerable population Dude wake fuck up, people fucking hate Sweden Swedes atm. good reason. always infuriatingly smug obnoxious never dangerous. changed now.

Fuck Sweden Yeah, think it'd helpful start phasing wet markets people buy bats pangolins stuff. Chickens issues, least one, well-known commodity. person 87 million followers holds significant political clout? wrong. may higher population density terms **total** land mass, much urbanization first world countries. looking urbanization.

Hence New York City deaths per capita US, people first world countries likely live mega cities. 

My understanding virus poor? I'll tell wife, works vaccine covid19 one largest pharma companies world. wonder she'll think. moron, exactly like wasting time morons. don’t understand we’re still mask shortages know several different places go online buy fresh N95s right now. tragic, case hospitals vendors they’re required use, price limits buy? I’m iust struggling understanding many common people access protection hospitals still failing staff lack basic PPE. Israel aka America light You’ll find lot world’s governments shit detractors one side find reasons make serious events (COVID, Climate change, etc.) hoaxes perpetrated cause unwanted change. comment history enough demonstrate live another reality. None newspapers websites say excess deaths counted covid deaths. purchase corrupt politicians still need money.  
Focus earning money , earn it. like good vaccine, assume large demand, think risk population priority. Vaccinate enough people won’t spread. I’ll get needed/doctor recommended future. Unless get crony capitalism might actually chance. we’ll EOL thank Donald Trump republican party, bois amazing job .. like Trump says ""AMAZING"", keep up! next thing economy going toilet ""How much India's declining case numbers contributed rapid tests, much real slowdown difficult say,"" Dr Shahid Jameel, leading virologist, told me.

He said scientists know certain government releases data many PCR antigen tests done, compared daily case load.""

Even scientists can't confirm real slowdown, media still make news clickbait title like that. always maybe/could yet inconclusive studies, can't wait make news complete studies? 

Because way media portraying studies scientists, always trying say things ahead proper study hurting trust people scientists. 

That's misinformation high moment, people feel safe trust news show scientific studies contraditory, inconclusive, even obnoxious population time right ""there Americans here!"" Nope unfortunately surviving change narcissists' perspectives. reinforces misbegotten delusions superiority. really switch accounts this? Big yikes. Oh course. focusing players got infected. Thanks. easier think feel good knowing contributing scared animals killed.

Except vegetarian. chicks “no use” egg industry grinded alive, young calves taken away mothers vegetarians omnis alike steal mother’s milk. end veal omni’s plate near you. mention suffering caused laying hens dairy cows environmental impact human health risks (emergence new pathogens). overall impacts vegetarianism omnivorism actually similar they’re actually deeply intertwined. said veganism instead, would agreed you.

P.s. also don’t supplement whey protein continue work successfully. Groceries? think cooks himself? That's lobbyists around time. think deniers would subreddit? Bro anyone that’s able drop hat give death totals one recent world war likely wars they’re war fan watch TV shows it.

i’d argue less one 10 people could tell death total either war asked random people walking around street. “People keep spending money, selling earn money” 

Fixed you. Downvote away Definitely probably Loudest Reddit loudest everywhere? spectacular failure perhaps? Let drink bleach shit probably Trump's team's orders crap, Trump can't help want attention doctors go along really started September, got cold here. germany low case number 500 daily since end August almost 5 times higher. possibly anything Idaho's right-wing politics, macho recklessness, low educational levels, constant anti-mask demonstrations. understand people think fake. believe believe millions doctors, patients, patients' families, nurses scientists world deliberately working together pull hoax 'political reasons.' would even possible? governments, even governments hate other, working together crash economies too. makes sense all, especially alternative reason what's happening simply 'there's new virus spreading around.' like concept virus crazy getting millions people worldwide collude conspiracy benefit themselves, people contracted viruses know exist.

Something really weird going way people think moment. like they're completely disconnected reality way things actually work. Schools compulsory, universities not!

It literally thing care about. coul line every poor person American machine gun pit give two shits. could make 50% america homelss still care. 

But abortion? literally worse holocaust mind, literally. phrase used again. trump give one SCOTUS judge overturn R v W make abortion illegal care about. 

Source: spent 20 years cult, know well. real life worst case good measure either.

Judge looking examples handled differently. U.S win here. also reports Las Vegas Raiders one player tested positive COVID-19. could especially troubling ESPN reports several players Raiders seen without masks attending indoor charity event last week.

This bubble good. protects everyone.  Nah,  
Honestly reddit social media follow actually pushed path financial independence. 
And occasionally see posts like these. Dude Reddit full shitheads paid vaccine hype. Keep opinion it’s valid decide own... 7 day backlog, every week add additional cases past.  particular Abbott test designed beginning used way figure ""is REASON person SICK Covid sick something else?"" ""has person recently exposed?""

At first sounds like stupid ineffective test think it, totally makes sense. Abbott correctly foresaw situation ultimately millions SICK PEOPLE would visit HOSPITAL seeking treatment upcoming months doctors would need quick cheap way know need treatment for. pneumonia? regular flu? Allergies? Covid?

There tests much better way check presymptomatic people, generally slower get market.

So White House strategy completely centered around testing chose wrong tool it. One understand limitations proper use of. disagree. replicate movie theater sound home, prepared entire neighborhood call cops you. Maybe you’re overestimating presence. Jesus Christ. Cam Newton Stephon Gilmore? knows they'll ever peak condition ever again. Decent chance career ending them.  software engineer, reading stories like blows mind. would trust guy's code, clearly zero grasp logic. used hate it, one people mocked everyone said know cook cooking sucked, true.

I'm vegetarian wife like leftover chicken, whenever cook Asian meal prep tends tofu. US ranked 206th 216 nations. nations much higher population density US. fact even third world nations much higher population density handling better proves point.
 really interested wasting time so
 
Haha, is. people really understand pandemic can't address specific nations problems, they'll simply talk countries doing.
 
Anyway, I've shown understanding virus pretty poor, fact avoiding answering simple questions tells realise - good see learned me. think best leave since started getting little worked towards end. Exactly. Fans attendance one disgusting aspects NFL deciding play right now. need revenue. Meanwhile NY..... known pre-existing health issues apart ~~high blood pressure~~ known pre-existing health issue. Say hi $199 shitty steak $19.99 mcdonald burger factory farming. love tofu, like lentils too. Spain really weird counting system, every week add additional cases past data. recommend site, validated data:  community transmission defeated little risk contagion, live return normal. That's situation countries controlled outbreaks. course people highly affected countries defeatists say virus undefeatable us 500? Try 2000 more. Good.

If simply invested monthly amount fixed day month , would seen investment grow rate Bezos. Asia conspiracy theories centered around virus situation worse government portraying, secret community spreads buried. normally functioning hospitals lie, guess.

Now mentioned it, *is* somewhat fascinating think culture sculpts conspiracy theories. still distrust government fear mongering, went different direction. They're loud annoying, least keeping (and others) safe country secretly doomed lol. Hell 87 twitter followers even would feel horrendous spreading info. dont know help better health eat bio meat meat come locally country can't, put position anything goes preaching months. lewdness laws, protect? first day website? filled bitter, lonely people nothing going lives, they'll play pretend revolutionary internet make feel useful. Best ignore move on. ""struggling"" mean ""purchased corrupt politicians"", right? countries adopted herd immunity strategy. come say that's they're doing. 12 deaths it’s notice.... wow. Idgaf reason they’ll close them! never let norm! Whoosh  So, can't explain - ignorant opinion basis reality.

I surprised one bit. CDC report notes, “For 6% deaths, COVID-19 cause mentioned.”

In words, 94 percent Americans died coronavirus week ending February 1, 2020 week ending August 22, 2020 had, average, almost three comorbidities played role death.

Its COVIDS fault. still less people died year 2019 2017 tad dramatic friend. (lack of) reasoning lets people believe vaccines global warming conspiracies somehow millions scientists on. easy separate vulnerable others spreading it. breakdown country... amazingly need dick head


Fucking snowflake details, baby's gender, hometown, whether infant treated hospital health conditions may contributed death, disclosed.

Yikes cOrOnAViRuS hOaX One way find ones decided stop Americans slavery deemed illegal. Okay. fair. don’t see lockdown mask mandates separated much. science says simply wear masks lockdown, agree that. big parade NYC Spanish Flu caused many deaths. so, clear happened happening months now:

Trump decided, somewhere along line, US *will* adopting strategy herd immunity, **period**. Anything work toward ignored, anything disagrees that, decried. Regardless actual expert within government scientist say, President decided ""herd immunity"" politically convenient, therefore US doing. actions make sense context. I've looking studies like this. We've known, surprisingly, admitted hospital, symptoms months after. CDC study showed milder non hospital cases, symptoms weeks (but long term studies.). first study I've seen milder cases followed months, results scary bad: serious problems still common two months later. could agree people alive war considered Americans. people died actively seceded United States died non-Americans that’s remembered. fought will, still safe consider Americans book. bad news you...

Got cell phone, pay cards? Perhaps onboard GPS car?  “Uhm. It’s real, sweetie. one know it.” -Coworkers. grandpa advanced cancer. Lives Madrid. weekend went see him, Madrid closed down. Probably able see dies. 


Fuck virus governments. extremely low hospitalization death rates, without locking population down, would think fairly good metric don’t know can’t understand criticise happened country point things incorrect others’ criticism. don’t know single swedish person sub says never anything wrong. knappis said absolutely true, also true fhm majorly fucked beginning. see? mutually exclusive.

Please people, blindly believe ANYTHING see posted truth. doesnt matter almost allways ride alone. realize used fake quote site basis attributing quote Einstein, right?

Yeah. People stupid.

As Abraham Lincoln famously said: believe everything read Internet. read three times realized say Waffle House 😳 Berlin bars restaurants need close 11 pm 6 selling alcohol prohibited. Copy pasted article 

“Due possible exposure COVID-19 within inner circle, abundance caution, elected cancel remaining … shows,” rep told outlet. “For past three months pandemic, Dave Chappelle successfully created safe comedians, musicians poets express art without incident.”


He RESPONSIBLE. season gone without infection, now, comedian MAY exposed canceling last shows precaution. 

TIP: 
Read whole article leave comments. try offering money volunteers? It’s like making vaccine charity. constantly game capitalism maximize profits, fully understand works. Texas ton tourism too. People don’t know jack Texas. It’s major Tech hub usurp Bay Area decade. Everyone moved moving there. indefensable. 

I got nothing else. tracing contacts highly virulant Whitehouse staff completely wreckless endanging god knows many lived. 

Not surprising though presidants, DAYS diagnosed receiving world class care accessible everybody un-masks gasp out, ""it bad, afaid, live it"" Sigh, go again.

Morphine used often breathing issues, legit treatment, callous plan let old people die without making often take people 80 ICU, much like Switzerland believe. Full ICU cate (intubation etc) hard body, even young people, put older people it. problem before, know now.


Only 30 young (39 below) people appear died Sweden. really understand systematic turning away young people left die. also look enforcement? mandated half people follow rule...

We need start enforcing fines, everywhere. far less deadly age groups demographics. said. fact.

You're fake news Yupp. Even without pandemic masks routine dealing infectious diseases. Well I'm sure ""martyr"" killed thing allowed run rampant claimed hoax lol. entire joint chief staff quarantined. know sadder. dear leader attacking military privately staging theatrics publicly, military members dumb enough believe him.

Eh opponent widely hated among Democrats Republicans. even then, Andy barely 5000 votes Bevin. even edited provide edits too! 😂 Coincidentally, listened recent episode Week Virology, discussed Regeneron (which given President) gets monoclonal antibodies *humanized mice*, whatever means. wonders never cease.

My first thought ""Seems like horses could produce lot mice."" thought quickly mice reproduce. want able ramp production quickly, go mice.

I think Argentina lot horses, though -- cowboys wrangling cattle. Fair point, think ways mitigate without tanking economy must provide data showing followed clinical trial participants median two months final vaccine injection, according guidelines [posted FDA's website. agency also wants companies submit vaccines authorization least five severe cases COVID-19 seen volunteers got placebo, according guidance. “It is” 10$ popcorn 8$ cokes me.

I know, I'm childfree thanks God also bar aficionado. Han killed child guess remains balanced. tired winning... people killed somebody else grab opportunity talk something completely different, is, indeed, selfish. 

European BLM demonstrators talking conditions so-called united states. 

They talk children european school children calling eachother names, talked horrible date someone thought skin-tone looked beautiful. 

You train nose little more, european BLM demonstrations reeked vodka besides, thing actually allowed lockdowns, demonstrations. Doctors getting fired wearing masks. would doctors left working.

Our testing terrible made out, distinctly average. 

How simultaneously filling cafes bars staying home similar levels rest Europe? make sense sentence.  ""own human""... That’s jerks come masks hanging nose, blatantly refuse wear one go right hell. Sure do. did. Got nearly 5,000 upvotes 10 awards it. Yes, less Wuhan. Everyone stay home 2 months. People tested positive immediately removed home put quarantine testing negative. 

There course always little bit interaction, food delivery, doctors, garbage collection...

No one allowed leave city lockdown effect.

They lifted lockdown new cases 2 weeks, sure.

It require lot organisation enforcement rules difficult poor countries like India. OP I'll chip here. Smoked pack day close 16 years. last year would favor ban. first 15ish... man equal rights smokers, tired treated like second class citizen.

Singapore study bit older stricter 11 days, see probability infecting anyone tail end low either case. Sorry save links studies. Sweden seems well. Actually better US, tells many mistakes US done. 

Perhaps strategy deserves study. know. friends/family die? 'just flu bro' people getting numbers corona killed less people? Without safeguards place.

Luckily, enough people taking virus seriously safeguards place. places going back business usual though. We'll see plays out. immunity can't achieved vaccines work either. Vaccines work using immune system achieve immunity. body can't achieve immunity virus (herpes, HIV etc) vaccinations work. case, virus infect population years without major restrictions. One half people doesnt trust government follow guidelines try find workarounds ""fuck you""

Second half people trust government fuck completely expect another lockdown sooner later. follow guidelines trying find workarounds ""Enjoy freedom lasts"" someone ""covid fog"" go disability? know worry.

First time thought going die 2 days. second time didn’t even realize 🤷🏼‍♂️😑😒 campaign ad? Cigarette smoking kills 480,000 pet year, US deaths WWII, yet never shut everything much batted eye problem nation. think would able so, ethically would need inform study remove data study used determine whether vaccine works not. There's nothing wrong going getting antibody test want to. People decide want leave studies removed reasons time. There's nothing requiring stay all. Well excuse me. guess go day now. 200K half much cares. clarin main opposition newspaper, making excuses could favor government.  fact preventable. 'do right things' mean artificially deflate numbers catch US guard keep numbers low economy surpass theirs? make sense approve vaccine efficacy possible mean time whilst continuing monitor side effects. 

By time review efficacy would probably 2 months start trial anyway. top that, Trump called veterans losers. feel could hit number Trump administration allowed continue handling crisis. Fun fact: something kills people something else make less tragedy. still bunch people dying still fucking horrible. people making comments trying ""lessen blow"" making claims death rates things save comments today read 10 years time. still agree fucking broken human seek help. treated Children's hospital, commonly used sick try something get control.

I would say really bad ended needing surgery bit, stop taking something like 6 weeks could operate (it apparently hinders small blood vessel growth concerned problem healing process). needed surgery previous damage caused scarring strictures intestines, ended losing 18 inches intestine (end small, start large) healed well, thankfully.

Bold assume Trump cares either never natural herd immunity SARS-CoV-2 damn quick antibody decay. Everyone needs vaccine. vaccine may last three sex months. really problematic. production costs also logistics.

Thank God I'm canadian watch sidelines. government figured out. Crick? It’s like one day vanished. So, 9/11 times 100? I’m trying envision vaccine finally gets here. What’s going actually look like? Like, going called central location city stand long ass line people getting shots? socially distanced safe? trust vaccine FDA approves, I’m afraid catching vaccine day. shot wouldn’t help then. many factors Trump probably hard tell hell came from... like China right thing, dozens countries got control relative US, including many high population density countries right next China proper mask wearing, contact tracing, government supporting needed quarantine care packages etc.  believe anything comes cops 'career ending injuries' whole Masai Ujiri saga. cop lied stated got PTSD, dick stopped working, suffered 'permanent neurological damages' getting hit face chest fists (which happen) Ujiri hit HARD CAMERA TURNED (it didn't). Different view based science, UK based stats translated local (if get numbers/stats) I'm offering another viewpoint, wear mask, follow rules another lockdown, outcomes worse #casedemic.  That's next. kind like lana doesnt say shes sexist makes sexist criticism... understand votes. vast majority obesity *is* avoidable. Fauci trying manage expectations without making people lose hope. CEO world's largest vaccine company says it'll take 4-5 years make enough still built, workers hired trained, distribution cold chain built. Logistics massive problem first likely vaccine needs kept super-cold (-94F) way end user. There's mass distribution anything cold .

I expect vaccine companies wait till stable vaccine passes testing mass produce us ordinary people receive 2022, 2023. Congrats asinine comment year. end less swimming hole snake pit. lana del rey misogynistic racist person... Yep. Well said. excess deaths US year also significantly higher number. scientist fired Florida refusing alter data mask deaths, white house reason took access numbers away America's Center Disease Control, point numbers took odd inflection nowhere.

Here Australia flu almost wiped minimal social distancing efforts, even many Americans right thing, many probably quarantining far seriously Australians, diseases likely way moment US too, covid deaths likely even higher excess deaths year. setting stage collapse cards dealt aren’t winning election toss match everything soak gasoline coming weeks, watch burn, retreat hills watch Democrats try pick mess
 
Exactly this. Vote won’t let party work relief transfer power January. Vote fun homeless. Yeah thing is, fuck em  case compared covid death toll whole world too?

We currently War, need clear-minded !

And hoes ain’t loyal.  thought image Stone Cold Steve Austin second.

Yes... officially happened Treaty San Francisco, signed 1951 officially entered force 1952. Prior that, United States controlled Taiwan part United Nations Relief Rehabilitation Administration, delegated administrative duties ROC. Yep. Said another way - it’s like 9/11/2001 every three days seven months. IHME projects 3,000 American deaths per day December don’t get ahead this. would 9/11 every single day...  flu vaccine protects vulnerable population. Far effectively light lockdowns used covid. Yet still smarter Trump terms handle covid America wasn’t war long though know - son sickly 13 year old started taking it. vaguely remember mentioning using condoms sex, mostly made us chuckle happening time soon.

Because LYING DUMBFUCKS IGNORED gone quarantine Auckland landing, given special permission leave compassionate grounds, ***even though one symptoms attributed pre-existing condition.*** tested positive returned people little risk catching covid little nothing cold stop living life?

Because none things said. 
It's contagious. 
It's FAR worse ""a cold"". 
And lingering effects like organ weakness clotting -- Even MILD I'm almost 30 going let maybe catching cold stop enjoying life. I've already gave 2020. 2021 going back normal.

Why would 194K pneumonia deaths (with without Covid)in 2020 seem 40K pneumonia deaths average year? 

What causing excessive pneumonia deaths 2020? tune 150K deaths? completely agree. posting Americans saying won’t ever take it. I’m right trusting trump. I’m right you!

You pretty much can't get say anything even remotely critical Donald Trump leadership beyond ""I wish wore mask often"" even went way praise Donald Trump good debate performance (DeWine's) twitter account.

I get he's stuck rock hard place terms letting become sucked circus without angering Trump, think DeWine's mostly toothless rather grounded/near middle regarding COVID19. Since deleted comment even thought bat shit go. 

Actually ancient humans wearing masks would prevent becoming virus resistant less people would get virus thus smaller amount humans would build antibodies viruses. really really bad making analogies man. comment based headline.

From article factors are:

1. confining vast numbers stressed animals together weakens immune response allows become sicker easier 
2. expanding farms wild areas brings wild domestic species together allowing diseases jump 
3. concentrating animal farms area increases risk pathogens spreading 
4. global live trade transport animals allow viruses travel 
5. agricultural fairs auctions **and live animal markets** public get close species different places, let viruses spread

So oddly enough factory farming itself, things surrounding factory farming locations cause concern. #3 especially concerning really impact 1st world nations wild areas anymore. #5 direct confirmation main point original post **live markets** give viruses best possible opportunity jump species.

Point #4 first part point #5 happen factory farming, existing factory farms exist after. Edited. Please complete High School. Try get statistics class. Admittedly, didn’t read article ... schools opening CA elementary level.

Just someone scientist doesn’t mean aren’t entirely ignorant truth want be. idiotic. Modern factory farming lot less diseases west. rural parts mountain states COVID really showing force first time now.  We're seeing Idaho too. TL;dr version. safety comes profits. company deemed workplaces covid proof therefore can't catch causing alerts employees happen catch outside work. Well it’s 1 Symbolic, necessary Land Stupid. say ""Vote, life depends it.""
Or say ""Vote LIKE life depends it?"" Well, either don‘t actually look numbers don‘t really think.


I colleague seriously panicking around January. told cousin(or so) happens live China cousin swore it‘s way way worse say(I mean yeah, bad worse portrayed media).. 

Around 2 months ago legitimately asked us think Corona real doesnt believe anymore. 

Some people just.. Always lookout government apparently lies us. don‘t care thought. So, know question asked affected results. 

There zero percent chance would meaningful effect result. saves one life, completely worth it? Spain, months ago, started rule masks worn outdoors, places impossible keep safety distance.

The result every time went outside, crossed several people per minute without masks less meter. narrow sidewalks, waiting pedestrian crossing, crowded streets, etc. Many people either thought 30 cm meter (now understand ladies complaining men...) applied typical Spanish guile thought ""a policeman able prove distance get fined"".

Some weeks later, changed masks mandatory outdoors, 100% time. Problem solved. still cross people without masks every day much, much fewer.

Moral story: sure, wearing mask far people alone ridiculous, blanket mask policy way people going actually wear matters. least society like Spain, people tend respect law fear getting caught (if from, say, Nordic country, things work differently). know Italy, basically brothers, quite similar social customs, guess apply. insanity. like old gladiator fights. individual people cogs point, long high echelon makes dollar. can't believe it. Yeah pulled Wisconsin terms governors EOs shut down, luckily health departments putting own. Honestly idea what’s going happen Someone troll? must sad, pathetic life seriously come that. Wow. Sometimes forget pathetic lives must be.  Yes, circle round. asking? Babis absolutely give crap republic people. Remember, never resign. wants use Czech Republic piggy bank. Unlike Slovakia, health emergency board Czech Republic meet May last week September. Various directives changed every day. government employs various ""professionals"" like stupid dentist toxoplasmosis expert minimize health threat make Babis look good. Even goal hit 25K test per day yet met, actually since last week, test less people. Yesterday, performed 14100 tests... gone back cheek smooching France? Even 50% households consist one person (not sure actual number), still means vast minority people live single person households. Dude active conspiracy pizzagate subs. Don’t engage. Curious judge kinds things. First, children typically asymptomatic. Next, even kids show minor symptoms they’re rarely tested Covid. Third, adults would likely assumed picked places (work, shopping, etc) especially kids asymptomatic. really killing us safe, going mental bro

I fear people far gone listen wise words. imaginary superpeople organized plan worldwide scale, make sure appropriate things place (which would millions people), ruse upheld international community, everybody involved keeps mouth shut years. 

And there’s real life, it’s Herculean task plan one goddamn meeting office 5.  literally gave came for, thanks :) mean...to fair...UP closer WI MI :P, yeah, sure one. 1 week. lfg ""Global warming established science."" California schools open person instruction..  
Also took 7 weeks last time Florida opened early.They less 7 weeks election. coincidence. fucking microbiologist told dangerous spreading shit offered Zoom anyone else questions Covid reality.

Seems like good place plug American Society Virology's [Chat American Society Virology membership comprised scientists educators dedicated communicating current, evidence-based information current coronavirus pandemic public. Toward goal, curated list 300 members volunteered speak educational organizations (schools classes, community organizations, museums, etc…) virology virtual setting. way, hope make easy educators access experts support classroom learning relates current coronavirus pandemic. Fuck... virus finally affecting personally. Yes, actually. Democrats could power now, constantly seem things sabotage themselves. Hillary never candidate 2016, example, happened whole situation horseshit.

The GoP full anti-science morons... also general minority country. side keeps putting forth candidates inspire anything, many cases opposite: drive people apathy vote all. 

The GOP win elections, left keeps losing (there's subtle different two things). believe still outdoor seating only. open unemployment would like 50 fucking percent everything still closed. spend less time trying manage (which save lives all) time trying get government smart thing once.

**Tak.** Ladies gentlemen, US Government.... favorite quote comment section newspaper: 

*If nothing kind say, say nothing. nothing kind say, say nothing.If nothing kind say, say nothing. nothing kind say, sa.....ok, deep breath: ..*

*Hope people get better soon hope become advocates following health guidelines.* take Florida push someplace else?! Aside thousands scientists agreed heard immunity strategy, never one. thought people knew know, atleast foreign media finally learned. course doesn't. offer solution would political sub. asking care lives? question amirite? flat disc round? Like old saying goes ""A fish stinks head"". 100% Donald Trumps fault. (and even use example could never smart enough this) *the president* came said ""This deadly disease. Hundreds thousands people die mobilize react quickly decisively. We're sending masks everyone. Wear go out. Stay home 4 weeks well way eradicating disease"" *That phase would DONE beginning April. FIVE MONTHS AGO resistance medical scientific knowledge would taken hold.*

We would led world eradicating virus *BY EXAMPLE*. corruption day. **VOTE** Wait... it’s economic tragedy yet? comment tweet: 

""The antibodies (little things help body fight diseases) detected Trump ones body's producing rather injected with.

It basically means he's still pretty sick immune system yet producing antibodies"" Expensive, don’t stay you’re system weeks, they’re usually given injection aren’t something stock pharmacy, plus they’re likely suppress antibody response catch virus. 

It’ll good tool serious cases high risk individuals, isn’t something they’re going handing like candy. think even best diligent people pandemic going done let next summer. 

Absolutely not. high risk patient, single event die go person die see, period. left house since March even remotely close breaking. though, risk passing virus someone else possibly killing hang buddies person instead Zoom like weekly. never, ever worth me. Surely dumb, since he's engineer, he's willingly ignorant

i know many engineers intellectually gifted completely lacking wisdom ""street smarts"" watch much hopeful ""Kiss Ground"" Netflix Haha, makes sense airborne.

That's wear nitrile gloves along mask eyewear go store. masks paper thin...I call surgical masks, like face covering. earth round. oblate ellipsoid. % people contract COVID experience symptoms months later? Beyond ""Some people"" ""I heard one guy "" seen anything besides studies &lt;20 people. 7 million positives USA date. I'm guessing better info long-hauling support forever lockdown narrative. Flu kick ass months well. Pneumonia infections. 

99% asymptomatic recover home pretty reasonable given high level asymptomatics, ""asymptomatic cases challenging identify individuals know infected unless tested course infection, typically done systematically part scientific study. "" buttload people walking around walked around COVID recovered denominator known cases. instance, 88% 147 infected residents Boston homeless shelter asymptomatic, 95% 481 people infected Tyson Foods factory showed symptoms, Cha reports.""
So Like said, asymptomatic + recover home, would argue close 99%.

As Sturgis, go look COVID deaths state WI, IA, ND, MN, MI, NB state near SD numbers past 2 months flat. places reporting &lt;20 deaths/day. Believe me, people dying COVID going Sturgis, hear it. sub pins needles weeks would ""Harleys sale - Cheap!"" ""just wait 2 weeks"" turned ""It takes 6 weeks deaths register"" we're 2 months, saying people fact died, know it. lol They've reported seven day average 2,200 daily cases. 3,600 cases today though. Deaths per 10,000 59.7. find graph? dont even know economy is, you? curiosity, numbers 200k 300k labelled death cause? Pneumonia, flu? 

I know many conspiracy theorists like point blown numbers fact opposite. ""extra"" deaths pandemic got full blown labeled COVID19? I'm torn contract tracing regards COVID. virus spread easily, particularly among asymptomatic compared viruses. inaccurate PCR tests think used...

I'd like believe contact tracing saviour countries lower rates (rather things like population health, count deaths, etc.), educated countries. Read article. Israel. comment makes look stupid couple. CDC model flu uses multiplier take account death secondary causes complications, including heart failure, pulmonary disease. wasn’t clear closely tied downstream causes count people whose cause death certificate list influenza. 

We know Covid19 causes heart damage, renal system damage, nervous system damage many people. opinion see excess deaths effects many years virus controlled vaccine. No.

That make right  Harris tap plexiglass barrier every time Pence tries claim they’ve handled Covid well.  Everyone board Cain Train! Oh absolutely. Steroids well known soothing emotionally calming effects. well known cardiac therapies. Especially elderly. 

Of course putting already volatile unpredictable authoritarian world leader substance known heighten aggression, WCGW? know.

Average. don’t even fucking know anybody older that. [Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski spotted football game without mask saying would self-isolate due coronavirus we’re dealing with. CDC pandemic playbook need totally rewritten Covid.

Asymptomatic spread gutted assumptions testing, masks, contact tracing, PPE, etc. wouldnt trust Sweden? like 5th least corrupt 3rd democratic country plexiglass barriers absolutely nothing. virus get around also stay plexiglass infect anyone touches it. works hermetically sealed.

## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic non-stop infections SARS-CoV-2 continued ravage many countries worldwide. report discovery suramin, 100-year-old drug, potent inhibitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) blocking binding RNA enzyme. biochemical assays, suramin derivatives least 20-fold potent remdesivir, currently approved nucleotide drug COVID-19. 2.6 Å cryo-EM structure viral RdRp bound suramin reveals two binding sites suramin, one site directly blocking binding RNA template strand site clash RNA primer strand near RdRp catalytic active site, therefore inhibiting viral RNA replication. Furthermore, suramin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 duplication Vero E6 cells. results provide structural mechanism first non-nucleotide inhibitor SARS-CoV-2 RdRp rationale repurposing suramin treating COVID-19. masks. people living post online see cases hospitals empty. Plus ada can't wear mask.  Everything seemingly become subjective. think objective facts reputable scientific institutions people could get behind basic preventive measures COVID listening them, half population simply lives parallel universe ""alternative"" news every fact turned head, becomes impossible.

I feel like especially insane US. home country Germany, least public (state-financed) broadcasting media help disseminating findings Robert-Koch-Institut prominent virologists/epidemiologists, helped get everyone page. Okay, everyone - still share conspiracy nuts, they're minority.

So US, might consequence erosion faith public institutions, financial dismantling, decades decades. understand scientifically dogshit. You’re obviously looking facts. vaccine “won’t work”. I’m glad you’re convinced millions won’t die, $1million already WW. 200k US social masks aren’t morons.  You’re also one State TV (Fox news) brain washed individuals won’t listen sense reason.  pray family friends stay safe this. meantime I’m wasting time you.  cant win argument idiot. MLB much problem Marlins debacle.. 

and they're ""bubbled"" playoffs started - MLB travelling regular season. opposed statement, clearly coming ass. ""strategy"", genocidal act giving allowing many millions entirely preventable deaths many times entirely preventable lifelong disability cases.

And done once, people find lasting immunity thing. Traditional Chinese medicine believes scales help breathing (i.e. asthma) lie pick different numbers, make point want. That's trade. would 330k side effects vs. like 50k dying. would mean get one vaccines instead, little bit later. said serious side effects, meant death near death complications. couple people know say, ""That fucking Fauci!"".  Like made virus himself. look facts say plexiglass barriers stores useless. scenario, cashier customer close together facing other, larger droplets could vector spread, smaller aerosols. True, masks also block droplets, people flouting mask guidelines wearing masks improperly, good backup. airborne transmits without visible symptoms. Isolating group impossible would leave vulnerable even worked. Full disclosure- never watched Fox News 

Is onscreen disclaimer stating above, goes air? I’m new viewer presents commentary without hint /s, know he’s goofball spouting nonsense? wrote nothing Kn95 masks 95 masks (the K means approved Korea, US).

I agree points, quite true. KN95 Chinese standard that's similar US N95. Korea different standard named KF94. equivalent European one FFP2.

Also, note, seal around N95 basically requires headbands rather earloops. KN95 masks see earloops pass NIOSH standards. face seal N95 masks tend considerably tighter earloop masks. realize body corpse van morgue, impact capacity doctor deliver care another patient, right? Thanks.Yea, took plenty stuff fevers sore throats. Mind you, live NYC got sick April, height time New York epicenter. wore masks gloves even get mail. disinfected clothes every time went groceries. takes little bit get past protection preventative measures. never careful. Stay safe. Science science hasnt cains twitter account saying stuff would make GOP look bad? “Last week, Amazon said almost 20,000 U.S. workers tested positive coronavirus 6 ½-month period. Amazon, one companies provide data, said infection rate ranks lower states, finding cited evidence investments sanitation, temperature checks protective equipment keeping workers safe.

“But three experts interviewed Bloomberg said data unhelpful failed reveal whether infection rate improving growing worse. One said Amazon’s comparison workforce general population fundamentally flawed reveals lack understanding epidemiology. announcement may helped assuage critics say Amazon hasn’t done enough protect workers toiling pandemic, essentially useless employees trying assess whether it’s safe show work, said.

“It looks like someone put bunch numbers together, determine numbers, don’t know,” said Preeti Malani, infectious-disease expert, physician chief health officer University Michigan. “I idea make them. best, it’s incomplete.” Honestly dont get shouls big news. fda's job ignore stupid requests like would shocked delay political stunt order push back EUA past early November try increase public confidence. lot followers probably -- like -- sitting back watching shitshow eating popcorn. article misleading. schools California still open in-class learning. sample size small. bad title. way useless Pence? Well science California begs differ. follow scientists say people BRAINWASHED.  

ITS HYPERBOLE talk hoofed animal immunity Sweden country. Swedish strategy was, is, protect hospitals becoming overburdened. think that’s nit picking. Also probably 59 countries compare regarding testing guess would come average best. one able come credible reason magazine would biased [Origins 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic swine reading especially regards import/export animals without disease monitoring major issue. BTW, antibiotics nothing viruses. myriad reasons would disclosed infection case knew positive sooner disclosed. However, NYT reported getting tested every day unlike they've said every day. possible he's positive submitted test symptoms unavoidable. heard archeologists really bad coronavirus valid reasons bodies stacked trailers really nothing hospital system overrun ability move bodies morgue.

First foremost, people restricted travel. Thus, could retrieve bodies morgue send funeral homes adequate speed. increase inefficiency process generally tightly run.

Second, many people wanted funerals put crowd restrictions. Thus, bodies need stored somewhere. Again, much like industries tightly run efficiency, mass event clogged system. 🙄 Why? Isnt stupid humanitarian reason political reasons. help donald Trump win votes? Kn95 masks 95 masks (the K means approved Korea, US)

KN95's China. KF94 Korean equivalent.  Remember “Data science” statistics, Mac. ain't healthier it.

You're probably healthier buy (and therefore eat) less meat, one also buy less cheap meat. think they're necessarily stupid, definitely **choosing** ignorant. access scientific information rest us, chose continue choose ignore believe fantasies. wish actions affect responsible people them. :/ learned u/yaolilylu schools #1 setting UK acute respiratory disease ""incidents"" right now: 16  Trump made plea Fauci? missed moment. gEt RiD tRuMp!

They're complaining Bezos, individual amassed $175 billion dollars, even much. 0.12% net worth donated, meaning think plans helping others either. 

And cliche ""take responsibility future"" pretty obvious adult point, there's point addressing unless want tell students teacher. Maybe government take responsibility billionaires?

We blaming rich poverty others, imbalance created capitalism. Eventually, monopoly businesses compete. see great examples Walmart moving towns shutting competition. 

But again, end result unregulated free market. choice cater bigger businesses hold politician's nuts hands. responsible health, others. Fuck. resident neighboring state, I’m worried. Thank you!

Keep bed available someone worth saving. absolutely cost effective way produce food whatsoever.

What feeds animals? Crops.
What could feed people instead? Crops.

What cost harvest, mill package crops VS cost raise animal 'eating' age, kill, transport butcher it?

That last one actual answer I'm gonna assume less expensive produce crops.

There *need* humans consume animals generally. based wants, emotions. people get really upset (emotional) even suggested eat meat. They're upset they'll die allowed chicken, they're upset they'll miss something want something enjoy - something *need*.

We *want* kill eat animals. need to.
We want kill animals.
We paying happen. thought referring open cases, yeah, believe half-arsed measures. Oops! Seems like accidentally joined r/Coronavegan step. know vaccines offer 50% people protection- that's going cut it. therapies keep people developing severe symptoms best real hope going back normal.

They gladly help big corporations, stock market, banks rich. They're throwing money people need -- ironic. Salmonella gastrointestinal bacteria.

Handouts aren’t gonna help poor, everyone “equal” “equal” still poor. don’t need explain basis capitalism you’re hard working, usually agree it. absurd think virus hoax really amazes people think whole planet faking virus U.S. politics. people narrow minds. May well give thoughts prayers coronavirus.  Whatever say gruey...keep cowering. ✌🏼 That's fat ass gets. think feasible. What, shut everything still ""essential""? think people revolt. Remember summer made clear protest valid reason skirt lockdown rules. can't flip flop another lockdown. one banana, Michael. could cost, $10? Astute observations like make big bucks. like Trump testing positive last Thursday quickie test deciding keep schedule glad-handing NJ results PCR test also came negative evening jig up. ~~cheese~~ covid touch feel bad I’m you.

For part, help; real turning point switch gears change message sufficient supply. country leaders said, ""Now there's enough supply, go buy masks wear them.""

Hospital capacity remained flat.

Even miami-dade lifted many restrictions several weeks ago. Hospitalizations risen sort alarming level. *”Life finds way”* Way better getting worse. Well one bring virus world. people latch valid sounding argument confirm political beliefs regardless profession? course, would also need social change. Many people accept help offered. entire nation getting lesson it’s like living psychopath. 40% continue support still throes authoritarian worship yet realize victims toxicity, chaos, sadism. psychopath targets never understand. Probably never will. It’s contract IMO higher change getting counterfeit masks KN95. KN95 Chinese's equivalent standard US's N95. products made good faith, they're equivalent. given many cheap masks find online KN95 rating, can't real.

Of course cheap. porkchop costs $16/lb, whereas grocery store would less $3/lb. chicken $15 $20.

It immensely unspecific time carries negative conclusion. 

If Sweden 10th place world testing per capita (we’re not), would pretty awesome. negative statement author would still true. “Testing Sweden still lags behind many countries”. case, many = 9. 

A objective statement would be: Swedish testing average level”. Nobody thinks half-assed ""reasons"" faster clever people.

Sorry vague initial post. heard pholcodeine, results deaths countries world would rather people die get high.


dministration pholcodine causes production antibodies linked fatalities surgery, essential neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) administered prevent patient movement general anaesthesia.[9] antibody levels gradually fall low levels several years last dose pholcodine. However, presence antibodies causes 300-fold increase risk anaphylaxis anaesthesia.[10]

The link suspected neighbouring Norway Sweden found tenfold differences surgical anaphylaxis deaths. Sweden products approved containing pholcodine, whereas 40% population Norway consumed single approved pholcodine product.[10] Norway withdrew pholcodine market 2007, prevalence anti-suxamethonium antibodies fell 80% two years.[11] corresponding fall anaesthesia deaths followed.[10]

A similar disparity exists NMBA anaphylaxis rates Australia, pholcodine consumption high US, pholcodine banned.[12] US, anaphylaxis rates low anaesthetists question existence reactions NMBAs.[13] Conversely, Australian anaesthetists requested ban pholcodine[14] due high anaphylaxis rate country.[15] However, Therapeutic Goods Administration declined request January 2015,[16] pending reviews follow.


In contrast, European Medicines Agency's 2012 ""Assessment report Pholcodine containing medicinal products"" concludes this: Committee considered evidence association pholcodine use development NMBA-related anaphylaxis circumstantial, entirely consistent therefore support conclusion significant risk cross-sensitisation NMBAs subsequent development anaphylaxis surgery.[17]

I'm pro mask extremely harsh comment Where's data backing claim? 200k people die year car wrecks. It’s going get worse loses. two months fuck everything more. I’m terrified. Going public without masks bad. wear forever get break time get car.

Working masks fucking blows, I'll keep long needed. Others worse. know everyone whining ass fucking baby shit.  one chill 14 months widespread vaccine. honest see grossly overweight individual mask on, snicker bit.

But please, interpret mad king anyway like. show source shows 40 deaths per 1000 recent years flu also COVID19 October. Provide source please. logic, can't claim wearing mask effect. scientific evidence similarly good. Interesting. Got source claim? No, Sweden never herd immunity strategy. strategy keep curve flat possible via enforcing social distancing guidelines recommending people work home. hit head... unfortunately experience producers take back seat. literally, screw 15 million people indeterminate amount time. wonder many die sooner heart disease related stress? guess that’s irrelevant, like 2.6 avg comorbidity rate covid deaths. Oh god. accurate. think you’re missing point. isn’t regarding continued lockdowns US, whether lockdowns whole effective strategy. US =/= world. places put back place variety degrees lockdown, supported scientific data.  I'm backing point. I'm correcting. Saying Sweden close schools true. close large amount schools.

I may bit unspecific intent reply. Left bit much imagination. reassure of, exactly? least liberals fighting WEARING MASK entire pandemic.

Holy fuck, goddamn imbecile. I'm democrat republican dumb media enemy

 Painting entire media one brush dangerous illogical. plenty brilliant work done every media form available.

Of course Fox News admitted court tenor show inform viewer hosts stating actual facts...

There's big difference shitty media like Fox News even MSNBC, good entities NPR many incredible non-fiction books written.

You fucking imbecile. lol love source. 'It's true believe me' 'You're wedding consultant' 'I sources'. may true, shitty source. 2020 keeps plugging. can't give FDA want deadline important? Follow-up question: amphibian humanoids skin suits catch 'rona? Problem economy is:

Besides, studies financial transactions US shown quite obvious effect.

Also, investors like kind unpredictability.
That's Taiwan South Korea likes much better UK Spain, look wars, select group able bodied men,(and woman afgaistan) coronavirus targets everyone, sick,old,young, pregnant, Etc. Kinda unfair compare two causes fear mongering need time. think get older I'm starting realize matter what, rich trick idiots people can't afford wrong never change.

I'm starting realize side we're needs keep trucking along thing try make world better place.

I'm starting realize people help always accept fact helped, always accept right, accept best interests heart.

And that's okay.

So ""we"" every single one us believes understands covid serious, ""we"" every single one us understands we're getting fucked over, ""we"" every single human truly wants fellow human better life. assume 'wearing mask' 'not wearing mask' exactly same, effort 'putting on' 'taking off'. assumption wrong.  restrictions daily life!**

Can't really claim that. hundreds people walking past narrow street city centres course virus air, matter outside. chance *lower* mean non existent.  understand false positive rate high calculate deaths / total cases 211 *10^6 / 7. 53 *10^9 = 2.8%

Let's add confident interval 90% (standard 95% btw) = 2.52 - 3.08

So best case scenario still 2.5%. Borders open then.

People going start killing borders closed another year. heath experts support using social distance masks mitigation techniques suppress spread. Fauci good example. I’m sure experts saying lockdowns way go light recent mitigation techniques. Well winter coming people getting tired wearing mask tired caring. could horrible winter. Yes. someone dates none business. that's beside fact average cop things, absolute child. Oh god 🤦🏻‍♂️ I'd curious see age demographics likely believe conspiracy theories... don’t know scientists church interfering science alarm population. know, similar reason Trump didn’t let Americas know series COVID alarm average American. really get word meant, would explain please? obviously fake news make us believe coronavirus real. people story it, doctors, person wrote story, guy posted link, hell even fecking milk man it. OPEN EYES SHEEPLE!!!!! label disaster magnitude ""just politics,"" already lost  yet, weird way, seems like yesterday, - least - little changed past 6+ months.

Anyway, look like this. whole purpose ""flatten curve"" make pandemic take longer - spread out, hospitals could handle demand. never ""two weeks we're clear"". soon started working, went back normal lives, stayed course. Two weeks flatten curve, number months keeping way. no, kind patience. wanted pack churches Easter. We're stuck limbo curtailing normal life extended period time, without actually reaping maximum benefit prevention, cause we're half-assed job. help shitty leader. real piece shit go comes defending man literally killed another one. couple vaccines, anyway That’s restrictions happened though. left Facebook realized trying drain ocean bucket.

My mental health suffering.

Twitter next think. 330k side effects worse 400k dieing? 28 years old.. damn Christie, rest lackeys, already getting something this. tweet gets sent markets plummet, anotber tweet market skyrockets. doubt mind people know tweeted using manipulation make fortunes. Yeah everyone know says buy things also purchases cheap meat convenient. buying ethical choice sometimes mean can't chastised buying shitty stuff. Hmm might right! everyone keeps 6ft away secret service eventually security nightmare...? idea told obviously misinformed, flattening curve also told preventative measure healthcare system reason POTUS die gave experimental antibody infusion unavailable general public, addition arsenal drugs team top doctors. important remember that.

Unless everyone upper levels government: military, legislative, executive judicial - given same, shit's gonna get real. thug go around holding bunch 10$ notes flashing Instagram.  
And idiot enough brag wealth real life.  


But try telling friends financially intelligent, always met cold shoulder, real life version downvote. guys went simple message wear mask avoid large gatherings, wouldn’t issue. forcibly shut businesses try guilt people spending 18 hours day staring laptop, that’s lose public’s trust. analogy.

Analogies subjective, what's shitty may shitty someone else measure ""right"" argument know possible eat meat without causing pandemics. Maybe amounts we're eating right now, hardly necessary 100% planet go vegan either.

Hah. one arguing whole planet go vegan. developed countries resources go majority vegan, they're often also ones highest meat consumption. logic might arguing humans existing also causes pandemics, get rid humans. Urban populations much susceptible pandemics due high population density, mean get rid major cities?

Fair point. okay, say factory regulations problem. methane emissions cows waste animals polluting rivers oceans? 

Moreover, agree logic. Humans existing cause pandemics, there's many us right exactly problem. There's many people sustain planet. I'm saying kill people, limiting number children people must done next decades. foods cause cases mass poisoning bacteria too, nobody argues getting rid plant foods, argue increasing food safety standards instead.

We can't survive without plant foods, survive thrive without meat. Also, reason stop eating meat. Earlier humans exploit torture animals scale modern ones. doesn't, please get date science. good quality studies showing meat causes heart disease, except uncontrolled correlational studies. fact, link eating meat heart disease thoroughly debunked controlling relevant factors, like eating junk food exercising.

How date want be? work? provide sources claim say I'll look sure. new York times making mistake list wide spread mistakes... Good try though


Also, know yearly flu death count including ""probable"" deaths too, right? Clearly didn’t read title. article addresses Great Barrington Declaration directly. sum up: It’s way outside scientific norm, describes hoped for, realistically executed. Even then. That's 1/300th population - people care knocking door. dont need use condoms honey... plenty pregnancy tests right here! Username checks out. (Though fully agree.) ever watched film Idiocracy? I'm seeing lot recently Good bad imprecise measure. Tuesday voting is... silly. Sat back home.

Repeated attacks early/absent voting undemocratic. 

Agreed local campaign information access. Similar issues back home finding local candidates. guess past bit easier local journos newspapers. internet enable ""in crowd"" get information that's bit double edged sword. 

""This shite ain't easy"" actually saying putting mask taking ***once day*** effort taking putting ***multiple times day***?

How even tiny bit logical you? 😂Too true say ""maybe that..."" ""we?"" ""we"" responsible fixing issue ""they"" grow brain realize virus hoax? Seems many people deny reality simultaneously help filthy rich get richer powerful. See Trump voters.  Miller, Hicks, Conway. triumvirate enablers. mouth (press secretary) also commission. He's alone sick big house. I'm going get downvoted people may like honestly decide is. Unless living restricted area, lot people kind getting lives. [Look axios Covid related news interest mostly fueled politics recently way fewer people interacting stories regarding covid. subreddit muuuuch smaller used well. done decide time evaluate loved one's risk actions take. thought, since went process, also anyone else reading: it’s worth checking BP lying down, waiting 2-5 mins, sitting up, waiting 2-5 mins, standing. normal folks, shouldn’t different.

I able get BP reading standing, shed light one quirks I’d along: difficulty getting reading sitting doctor’s offices too.

(It turns related blood volume issues related POTS - postural orthostatic tachycardia.) Mmm article talks herd immunity Says guy burned Shireen! ;)

But, yes, OP is. factory farming virus came lab China. wet market China buy narrative. 

If factory farming, fine, nothing virus. People considerate enough wear mask already lethal effect, worth keeping society, society requires people thoughtful others, laws supposed for, plucking bad apples. someone doesn’t wear mask without good reason (not preference) bad apple rejected society. Thank least pointing obvious, oftentimes stuff sounds bad (i.e. ""chlorinated chicken!1!11"") actually fine people idea hell they're talking comes food safety, hence organic no-GMO fads example.

That said, what's principle wrong achieving high efficiency farming? known Earth spherical certain since 3rd century BCE (and honestly, idea around several centuries that, size first calculated).

The idea Columbus trying prove Earth round myth make Columbus look smarter heroic. Columbus actually thought Earth much, much smaller actually is, Portuguese Spanish scholars respective royal courts told monarchs full nonsense. Which, want emphasize - was.

If Columbus run smack dab whole continent, would died. monumentally lucky. following orders? break news long recovery. confederate army fire fort sumter He's woods yet treason human race favor virus Agreed - know good number people fit category, believe I've ever seen accompanied team corporate lawyers legally asserting writing. think he's transitional candidate. tend think he's right that. think that's need right now, even people want hear it. 

It might perfect, get back normal, go there. Progress needs made, took 12 steps back 2016. undone. take 12 steps back even 2 steps forward, we're much better position.

I guess view differently people. get Biden, save tens millions Americans getting thrown healthcare. get Biden, get Medicare expanded age lowered, saving probably around another 10 million Americans. get Biden, get real stimulus enough extension benefits get tens millions Americans lost job, bridge this. give enough save thousands small businesses. get President listens scientific medical advice. H1N1 could would way worse current Administration. We've seen Biden would do. He'd listen experts. lives saved. 

Most importantly, get President least TRIES lower temperature debate. get decent person least tries civil. Even people think he's pretending, that's step forward. Lower temperature, stop bleeding, listen scientists.

I think that's getting quite LOT. totally get pessimism even apathy, think we'll get lot people realize right now. PUSH there. Remember ""flatten curve"" hospitals fully filled patients? awareness, “free range” legal term. means company owns land per chicken. still keep cooped like regular factory farm. mf jail lifetime fucking workers making much money. Pure evil!! taxed 80 percent minimum. person got positive test, wife many colleagues. Clickbait!!! Shame! Swedens ""recommendations"" less useless.

Grow fucking balls Sweden enforce shit already getting rediculous.  Trump pressuring PUBLICLY issue EUA election, data in. That's appropriate. 

They've already take back one coronavirus EUA Trump bullied (HDQ). 

This real issue. Republicans need learn options “do nothing” “frightened meltdown” Lmao germany 250.000 daily tests 88 million. immunity get disease again

It's even ""what if?"", coronavirus. coronaviruses studied, lasting immunity people get reinfected within year, two.

Yet basing policy on? completely contrary available evidence assumption even asymptomatic COVID case confer lifelong immunity. 

Absolute insanity... haven’t wiped ass 5 years. don’t *need* wipe ass. No. all. civil war states declaring longer part union. protests/riots people expressing frustration excessive power use violence state. literally parallels drawn. Excess deaths seen everywhere covid hit. Global data shows clearly deaths directly indirectly covid, nothing else. would husband founded Amazon, complaining. prestigious thinkers engaging false dilemma. Lockdown return normal, nothing between.

They argue world's poor suffering, indeed are, august geniuses propose aid poor, full-speed capitalism way meet people's basic needs. 

These fools advocate locking elderly, ending steps reduce spread among rest us, pursuit 'herd immunity', failing note numerous reports reinfection SARS-COV-2 herd immunity coronoaviruses circulation never achieved. sure hell doesnt prioritize public health. 6000 people wouldnt dead.

I freaking idea prioritizes. Presumably Tegnells ego. Might could 216 countries US ranked 206th going deaths per 1m population.
 
That absolutely awful, fact Belgium shit job counter that. assume people really care... know Sweden, hard spot pandemic besides masks. Walgreens It’s quite brave. kind skeptics want, kind proud accept wrong. want people willing admit fault willing assimilate new information, ones reject anything contradictory they’ve established viewpoint. greatest threat civilization survival extant species ego mindset admitting mistakes makes weak. Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone attend make amends. everyone brave enough so. Yeah fuck sorry I’m paying $7 eggs. Call selfish don’t give fuck probably lol. are. vested interests make say act so. want attention like little baby. 100% that. whole thing sucks, answer botch walk back normal/safe. next year going marathon, sprint, need right. Agreed. Turns function american education political system anything else unique us. apparently human nature. honorary boomer, then, idiots out-idioted whatever previous stupidity attributed boomers Right traitors England. Stop bullshit man ain't helping anyone. Awe, given trigger warning. sincere apologies. buddy, high blood pressure hygiene mutually exclusive. High blood pressure naturally labour's breathing among multiple issues. risk facor GETING covid, risk factor severe reaction virus. necessarily likely catch it, likely die it. 
Payoffs paraphrase:

""The cure can't worse disease.""

I wonder said again.... mean, preventing people getting Virus first place must better treating people already right? Almost whole national soccer team tested positive, play german soccer team saturday? Ukraine soon surpass 5k daily cases. Sweden Finland released horseshit studies masks first iirc. Thank you! thinking thing, started second-guessing hard believe YMCA would allow risky classes.  Lol, wear pants go shopping? bet wear mask about, ones worried buddy, obvious follower.  did. still meat portions 40% 50% smaller.

It's great health, planet pocketbook.

Also ... friends care eating habits. Obligatory  
1 Lakh = 100,000 harsh realities tend buy *you*, slick Yes, compare virus’ casualties would happen near future anyways war casualties mostly tragic deaths young people. sub fucking retarded. That’s awesome then, impression opened couple weeks ago (I’m east coast, still 100% virtual, January). Hopefully sticks kids school! Old donnie holds bill everyone stopped selfish 2 weeks, last 6 months. wonder conclusions would study ended mid-October instead mid-August. COVID far though. I'm also vegetarian. supplement whey protein continue working successfully.

The difficult things vegetarian lack choice restaurants bit extra effort make cooking (e.g. can't throw steak brussel sprouts pan). Yes friends family vaccinated well. transmit virus amongst themselves.

You limit social exposure vaccinated though. comparable. Nice try though Dwight: FALSE can’t grasp someone health history (obesity asthma, sure else) wouldn’t super careful contract Covid.

Christie prove devotion. thinks he’s going get something relationship Trump, kiss ass cavalier health Trump is. That’s saying masks solve everything. It’s saying masks key part solution. true. Yeah, k. Talk doctor.   I’m still baffled amazed administration would everything possible election year crush pandemic easy road re-election. 

It’s weird watch play out. Isn’t strait bullshit though? WW1 way casualties. 

This title bullshit. side says ""we're part united states anymore"" one longer Americans like it. kinda going today riots anti-America leftists? kids school open 6 weeks cases reported. argument irrelevant discussion thread, specifically comparing countries. Scroll read comment started nearly every first world country handling much better? people agreeing thread disagreeing you.

Direct Covid-19 deaths subset total deaths resultant virus. End story. thought 'murcia freedumbs? huge deal kids. You’re one who’s butthurt buddy could argue schools neccessary risk guess. Kids need education. Although Sweden issues online connectivity idk.

As others, fuck knows. Honest question, since I'm american. grocery stores neighborhoods? Money get far lungs filling fluids. forget size population bit different now. Use population 1914 100 million whereas today's 330 million. 

I fully understand people use raw numbers, need context misleading. Yeah left Vice 2008, got Alt-Righty. monoclonal antibody called LY-CoV555 yOuRe wRooOnng passed Vietnam posted FB, friends pissed comparison still saying wasn’t bad flu despite numbers proving wrong well. Smdh pretty sure intelligent enough grasp purpose analogies like one completely missing point   Compassion basis morality. USA!USA!USA! We're #1!!!! Well 200k deaths already around 8 million infections

Population approximately 500 million could see least 1 million deaths must born middle nowhere side year 2000. fun frolicking around online. 😂😂🤦‍♂️ I'm fan Christie all, I'd probably feel safe around Presidents entourage well. would assume people orbit constantly tested (if anything avoid bad optics outbreak).

I mean, wrong, think unreasonable think that. *was* extremely skeptical Corona info China but, part, proved more-or-less factual. Iran still warm, imagine happen gets cold there. least Teheran cold days. This. hasn’t time see infections rise. story stays true 4-6 weeks, ecstatic. Biden make sure one goes fairly quickly I’m sure walk past sure, outdoor interaction occur.

Also, cases rising, maximizing interventions limited negative impacts even benefit small? People seem deadset keeping indoor dining running, schools large social importance... social bubbles kiboshed masks distancing enforced. cases obesity heart disease genetic. people eat like crap. trying discredit Chinese science medicine. worked drug discovery colleagues Chinese. Many left states gone back China taking decades knowledge experience them. China powerhouse drug discovery long. control almost raw material sources large spectrum drug molecules. Lol others people?

Why think assign non covid 19 deaths covid deaths? need lie justify destructive short sighted policies?

These covid 19 deaths, whatever way spin it. Uh drive in? Tj border open ever. it? grandmas basement bUrNinG AmErIcAn CiTiEs 😢? see people, especially health none business care about.

Empathy apparently hard people owned people property. ye ""quality"" education 90% people get basic education Remembering Repeating. opposing viewpoint disagrees research that’s hand selected disseminate public keep people living fear. 

There’s plenty research supports herd immunity, shows virus less lethal described posts subreddit, shows danger mental health economy outweigh danger human life. Shall get guillot*ne ready? Except yourself. mask keep spread happening. Maybe wall community whatever want, don’t get infected. call it... ghetto something. Great point. think balance mitigation also keeping society going going important Swedish model useful seeing outcome it. never needed feminism parents shit ton money. Ez. Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.

Just sayin Think like this, flu vaccine made likely flu strains year. Sometimes, main flu strain turns vaccine. years 200,000 people dead. *laughs German* Thanks! That's naïve, reductionist view. Let's rephrase it:

If thought approved October 31, scientific advice purely political gain, regardless safety efficacy, would take vaccine? If, hand, political motive nullified (because Trump lost election Nov 3), vaccine approved November 5, make likely take it? Ref:

If anything, police longer dare set foot immigrant neighbourhoods. time immigrant criminal runs cops fatally crashes moped electrocutes himself, country burns.

So clue protests coming from, feel like everyone useful idiot cause. wonderful idea!

Definitely helping cut risk manyfold. idea convert theaters live entertainment venues sell liquor various foodstuffs. Coming 30 older crowd's perspective know folks younger would like. 

This cuff without spending much time thinking details....  

Once pandemic addressed...however want define it.

You could nice three act show 1.5 hours. $15/head acts split $6 evenly. So, 100 people? act gets 200. 4 person act/band that's 50/30 min work. 4 acts day that's 200/day 25/hr. (just illustrate chump money...you could make living.) Heck, go RenFest let acts get tips back people leave well. 

Leaving $9 theater acts profit food alcohol. Popular acts may even negotiate share bar. I've movie 2 times last 7 years something like may go twice year. Would fun date night something can't get home.  

Heck, could house acts, acts less expensive headliners. Saturday night might $25/head popular acts. 

Monday's new comedy acts, Tuesdays new bands, Wednesdays whatever.... 

I could come tons ways this... 

How entertainers offer work tips slow nights try new material? 

Authors could book readings new books give autographs. 

Political candidates could book time theater offer meet greets. 

We've cooped long think small, local, events like would popular. 

...  

Big band night. Sure...it's expensive...but 20-30 person orchestra playing big band. food made local chef top quality ingredients. Super classy affair dress code everything. Maybe one theaters completely redone support concept. 

Maybe develop following locals band. could battle bands neutral territory favorite local bands regional awards....etc. 

Same comedy acts improv.  

Traveling Cirque du Solei. (One night one act only...only 200 seats available) Yup lies BS stories. He’s rat ass fat ass loser coward. need make lose go jail. Fuck Trump. thing achieved catching Covid know is. Fail see driven country though? probably also lot deaths aren’t covid counted incorrectly covid, make will. We’ll never know truth either way. let dominate life.... Humanity died miliennia. Grave yards used full babies children. Poeple name kids many months old. Others would reuse name would bury multiple babies name one lived full year.

They celebrities coming country, sit indoors, close proximity.

Governor Cuomo, please something this. Talk entitlement. People complain called unpatriotic wanted terrorists win. confuses me, maybe someone help understand. far knew, entire false belief Covid real came entirely America, Trump, basically. political drive deny clear obvious me. But... nations - like Israel - clearly Covid deniers too. America truly influential? politics spread lies falsehoods around world? reason, unique different country drives people exact denial?

The latter possibility seems strange me. hard believe. first also seems hard believe. live US, seems strange think country live could influential something like... denial global plague. 

Does anyone explanation even Covid denial countries like Israel Germany England many nations too? spreading US, something else cannot grasp?  SO's family understand want see person, going lives normal thinking cloth mask full protection. helps, N95 social distancing seem get stores closing that, no? Poor indeed Death counters wars (overall, including US involvement) 

- Vietnam war - 2M deaths (possibly much 4M)

- Korean war - 4M deaths (at least) 

- Iraq war - 405k deaths (possibly much 1M)

- Afghanistan war - 141k deaths

- WWI - 17M deaths (at least) seriously expect Denmark's Covid death rate jump 114/100.000 Sweden's current 582/100.000? 

With Sweden's mask advisories likely Sweden's current case rise accelerate deaths again.  New Zealand ""squashed"" virus many times year. virus also come back multiple times. 

These articles useless. That's actually point. Slow hospitals keep time. That’s still manageable spread lots people going holiday, political mass gatherings shops every day. say number. Quit comparing plus plus number nobody fucking knows many died wars heart. originally replying actually believe 7.5 million Americans infected. states roughly 10% world’s population infected. US among hardest hit nations, it’s stretch assume 10% Americans infected 32 million. Studies within US also point much higher infection rates 7.5 million. times I’ve theater years new Star Wars. ***Noice.*** total hospitalization rate

As know America place people able get hospital care need didn’t think pure evil could get sick? Many, maybe most, people noncompliant employers antiquated ideas work work-life balance....and kids school, that's much harder fix.

That's....not works. many remember Republicans lost minds trying keep Terry Schiavo life support? 

What happened protecting sanctity every single human life? ^ yeah lmao voluntarily compelled threat government? Hear ye, ye! average age covid deaths US higher avg. life expectancy US.

This statistically misleading. average lifespan American might 77, people make 75 tend live least 10 years longer. Using reasoning could (incorrectly) say people get covid live longer.

To sum up: We're comparing apples oranges right now. think sensible try evaluate worse. Cases massively underreported, people mild symptoms less likely get tested. 

There quite studies looked IFR.

[The CDC estiamtes age 

The earliest IFR study know [Verity et latest study know estimated IFR 0.26% non-institutionalised population. would much higher reality people care homes much higher risk death. 

[The highest estimated IFR-S \(the percent people symptoms die\) around Around 40% infected COVID show symptoms. study bit older, hospitals much better treating people. fled Denmark choice.

""WAR CORONA!"" ? deep sand buried head? last 25 years, seen moron claim every single time Chinese GDP figures released.

If numbers even 0.5%, cumulative effect date would massive. Yet physical infrastructure real wage growth blatantly right there. Apparently is.

At rate, suspicions confirmed .13% IFR cherry-picked stat based extreme hypothetical estimated cases excess deaths could caused numerous things Covid. example numerous people presenting late hospital lockdown causing uptick heart attack stroke deaths. can't assume every excess death corona related. Wasn’t 400,000 deaths WW2 alone though? What's sad none happen. Everyone, look China. Country back normal, people walking around, going vacations. 2-3 months serious lock downs targeted lockdowns/contact tracing new outbreaks. Citizens took things seriously back normal. US could ended pandemic May/June. would massive job losses we're seeing now, amounts deaths, bitter polarization increased.

It's also China. New Zealand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea. Basically nations used masks, lockdowns, social distancing appropriately - following normal guidelines. able resolve situation mostly back normal. Yeah that’s gonna happen Lmao  think paraphrasing amalgamation quotes.

Ski resorts spread COVID like wildfire last year. resorts voluntarily shut late Feb early March, month early them.

So, example, six-person lift, they'd normally combine two groups three fill it; year. And, they're going try keep people six feet away lift lines, basically impossible. Also, resorts even selling tickets resort now. Instead, buy pass online, they're selling limited number. Park City (like Vail-owned resorts) variable pricing based availability like airlines do. So, sell, fewer left, expensive ticket becomes. They've done years, last year, saw day passes go $245/day.

Hmmm. mention background tech... misinformation, directly CDC dude. Infection Fatality Rate statistics using information available several million antibody tests done get population scale true infection rates, combined higher real fatality rate seen excess death studies put IFR Covid-19 0.65% US.

This aligns rest world. currently IFR range disease far enough path sample sizes unfortunately big enough make least preliminary conclusions. ***630x*** likely die Covid infection 85 older someone 18-29 years olds.

5-17 year olds TEN THOUSAND times less likely die. death rate group still big error bars, number kids died Covid US knowledge still less 25, total. currently appears 0.001% 0.004%.

 officials expressed opposition plan, large part called two-month observation period see whether people got vaccine suffered negative side effects, Wall Street Journal two-month waiting period would make certain vaccine couldn’t approved use U.S. election, target President Trump aiming raising objections, White House officials refused sign guidelines didn’t seek changes could lead administration go-ahead, according people familiar FDA, however, prepared follow guidelines even though White House hadn’t signed off, agency notified vaccine makers details.

There 210k official deaths. gives fatality rate 0.3% even ignoring fact deaths probably underestimated well. far range given well excess potential effects vaccine. lunch today company rep believes spoke ONE cardiologist family friend, need masks, never shut down, ""top game"" prior virus. 

This country beyond fucked....  would take 330k serious side effects heartbeat stops pandemic cold tracks. Covid easily kill 330k additional people pandemic continues, mention economic damage.

Honestly 500k US deaths pandemic would huge win point. nah man see like 6% died covid rest died cuz things covid...so know bad. Superspreader events. See probably two months Wow weirdo. Amy Coney Barrett. That’s allowing this. Scumbags. Exactly! Eating unhealthy, exercising, smoking personal choices... respiratory system. hand would need touch face enter eyes, nose, mouth give virus. Yeah wearing masks places given time year. still net less direct contact. less family gatherings. think masks social distancing, see decrease flue. it?

[The estimate like Well numbers evidently wrong, but

Someone inevitably trots ""but cancer heart disease!!!""

Yeah. It'd good worked unhealthy people planet, too, like pipe dream, right? Current state PPE White staffers visit Oval Office second floor residence, Trump lives holds meetings, expect within six feet president, memo also requires wash hands use hand sanitizer entering; remove outer garments; personal protective equipment provided “Isolation Cart” — including yellow gown, surgical mask, protective eyewear White House changed mask guidance** still following Centers Disease Control Prevention guidelines recommend, require, wearing mask. Several administration officials said nearly everyone White House wearing mask recent days, including Trump’s son-in-law senior adviser Jared Kushner, usually sport one. shape mask nothing filter performance. Every country respirator standard, they're less equivalent. company made K94 could easily make N95 exact shape. studied scientists effective.

I doubt study ever conducted never need conduct it. fucking obvious. Chicken Cow? seasonal flu every years. except media age 78 years old, life expectancy Yellow Cake goes great warm cup covfefe. Enjoy long term health damage COVID dude. That's point all. War awful. level destruction unmeasured. COVID destroy infrastructure. Also, figures US casualties account many multiples died countries countries happened. However, country, many memorials people remember tragedies lives lost wars. gives perspective. 9/11 every 3 days year. 70 x 9/11. lost citizens 9 months 50 years warfare. maybe give people pause might taking seriously be. War fucking sucks, also sucks. That's point. [Confederate States really want compare Spanish Flu simply health system basic hygiene levels increased signifigantly. current level development, survive things previously wiping us millions.

For example, Black Plague still exists, threat us longer.

If Spanish Flu resurfaced right now, would kill Covid-19?

I know, kill nearly many back then. still much know virus. Healthy people age 40, even age 30, dying. Statistically lower rates, come on. sobering enough people prevent spreading old risk take measures protect case.  demonstrate something mandated do? Masks even recommend. # Never forget!!!! burned encouraged people go cruises. Never forget voted leadership let happen, absolutely never forgive. fuckin stupid, think chance give us poor people money work.  still nowhere near number innocent civilians killed Korean war US civilians Vietnam.

Hate downer, work great turned Trump-loving Evangelical megachurches. Except vaccines like Moderna candidate completely new type vaccine never done before. already reports last day participants experienced severe side effects. I’m saying it’s going kill people, could still plenty side effects won’t know unless it’s actually tested properly. It’s confusing China made big promises give vaccine. Could issues here? President United States involuntarily evicted Oval Office biggest source resistance appeared Trump himself, who, despite come home three-night hospitalization, defiant — **lobbying return immediately work Oval Office**, discussing address nation early Tuesday evening clamoring get back campaign trail coming team, instance, tried puzzle way safely return Oval Office Tuesday **ultimately nixed request,** said two people familiar discussions, like others spoke condition anonymity reveal internal (mirror WaPo link) Nothing I've seen suggests risk factor.

Reddit Enhancement Suite installed, filter flair, means exclude posts USA flair here. 

I'm sure something similar done mobile, sorry. lot sure, look that’s virus killing, sound morbid insensitive, average Americans life expectancy 68 right remember looking number. Also reference 2018 2.8 million deaths US, always going something kill us, unfortunately it’s apart life. 

The death rate numbers don’t help towards positive outcome. think this, locked June, 100,000 estimated death rate, 4 months virus, states opened people working shopping 4 months, 100,000 people dead result virus weren’t locked down. 

The virus real, clean courteous best option ramifications lockdown isn’t promoted, healthy diets exercise increase immune systems isn’t talked either combined politicization virus completely embarrassing disappointing.

Good Dr. Foege fighting good fight, trying right least wrongs right thing. says reduces visits doctor's office 40-60%, illness. people need doctor get flu. 

From CDC vaccine prevents millions illnesses flu-related doctor’s visits year. example, flu vaccination prevented estimated 4.4 million influenza illnesses, 2.3 million influenza-associated medical visits, 58,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, 3,500 influenza-associated deaths.  seasons flu vaccine viruses similar circulating flu viruses, flu vaccine shown reduce risk go doctor flu by [40 percent 60 numbers go, death rate Flu roughly .06%-.1%, vaccine prevents 4.5 million cases year, 3,500 would put death rate .08%.

As non american, ut seems like reddit's main point view colored fact Trump charge. Trump bad situation must bad. 

I speak country (sweden), similar number death per capita (as many european countries reliable data), average age died higher average regular age death would unfair say corona killed 200k+ compare young people killed wars, lives front them.

Obviously, countries reliable data really well, future tell best/worst policy, america certainly worst.  making claims anything besides America dense Sweden. isn't. 300k+ btw based deaths average.

Do see illogical line reasoning is? Wearing mask gonna harm either take precaution? Eli Lilly said seeking authorization drug derived blood sample one earliest U.S. survivors Covid-19.
By Peter Loftus
Oct. 7, 2020 8:49 ET

Eli Lilly LLY +2.25% &amp; Co. said requested U.S. authorization emergency use experimental antibody-based treatment people recently diagnosed, mild-to-moderate Covid-19, following positive results clinical testing.

The company said seeking authorization drug, code named LY-CoV555, derived blood sample one earliest U.S. survivors Covid-19. company said last month drug reduced rate hospitalization compared placebo study.

Lilly said Wednesday manufacturing doses could 100,000 doses month many one million end year.

Lilly also said new study showed combining LY-CoV555 another antibody reduced viral load, symptoms hospitalizations Covid-19 patients. company expects seek emergency use authorization combination November.

Lilly’s antibody meant mimic antibodies human immune system neutralize new coronavirus. approach similar experimental antibody-based treatment Regeneron Pharmaceuticals given President Trump. I've heard mutation theory, seems like would unique aberration norm. People citing Spanish Flu's second wave early pandemic reason completely lose minds...but said, norm viruses eventually become less deadly time, deadly. I'm happy many trained child psychologists weighing thread OK buddy analysis criticism allowed? Oh no!

Anyways... ""all politics""

I get US self- centered believe world wide plague lie impact national politics, always funny hear countries assert worse world war

the assertion US deaths thing. Please, keep better  Nobody believes Y'all watch videos taking within factory farm, including slaughtering process. Someone death bed included excess deaths number, though, would've expected death year, using excess deaths would actually eliminate shoddy attribution covid death. actionism, yes spreads air, outside viral concentration miniscule. ""You're"", I'm US American, I'm EU. nice try pushing shitty agenda.

Your argument irrelevant, they're hit second wave right now. Aside Germany, EU US different terms corona death rates per 1 million. rules need 3 k participants, said need data half total study participants followed atleast 2 months minimum study size work 3 k participants. absolute crime particular nation race people, whole humanity itself! can't randomly catch ""heart disease"" (so might well compare ""infectious diseases?"") dumbass raving ""muh freedums"" though?

Oof, that's stretch. Nice mental gymnastics though thanks confirming said vegans vegetarians thinking they're superior eat. Outside risk infection lowest, soon keep distance. indoor masks effective.

The thread's factory farming, whether eat beef. 

Stop straw-manning! Sadly, government feel like anything real it. Instead actual measures, enacting compulsory masks outdoors (which nothing considering know vast majority transmission indoors) pretending means ""being tough"". Meanwhile, schools open, work home mandated etc...  Urghur Muslim? story prime minister absolutely anything get away trial

Ah U.S. Israel lot common. herd mentality mob immunity. wars fought people 70s 80s, right? course not, mortality rate would’ve much higher. 

Making sense yet? repeat - misleading misinformation. Don’t dazzled (mis)use statistics. Common technique.

You invulnerable 85. invulnerable 40. virus killed ten times people flu. death bad outcome - majority “long haul” sufferers mild disease. *No scientist anywhere* supports user’s dismissive mishandling facts. *No scientist anywhere* agrees T.rump pandemic nothing worry about. *No scientist anywhere* supports *lessening* restrictions instead increasing them.

We know long-term effects would still-developing child’s body. *do* know kids major spreaders, in-person schooling mistake. also know users like Shandlar distort facts way possible downplay virus, sprinkling occasional sources make seem like argument merit. not. guys need watch South Park pandemic special *fat fuck money connections

Regular people get check hospital proactively. read person’s COVID-19, aggravation starts 10-14 days everything seemed Ok! take good care, everyone knows he’s hyperactive stay still. really good idea? virus dispersed quickly outdoors unless standing right next someone else, mask outdoors really going provide meaningful benefit? talking about? proved argument wrong country good resources must low numbers. France, UK Germany 3 strongest economies EU (pre Brexit), UK France numbers US terms covid death per capita.

I called shitty argument doubling bullshit. Who?  link proves US awful job. ranked 10th worst deaths per 1m 216 nations outbreaks.
 
It's even shocking considering late initial cycle US got cases. excuse Belgium Spain virus gripped nations anyone knew severity COVID. time hit US impact known, yet little done. looking single statistical marker poor comparison.
 
I genuinely get ""yeah ____ worse"" logic. country exonerated Andorra handled poorly. That's weak think you’re right!! Australia New Zealand islands, make easier control flow people. Seems hard come conclusion ignoring research.  Umm, learn read. said US deaths. global. People care profits absolutely nothing ever get way that. Like climate change deny deny deny keep they're take every available precaution? Masks harm anyone. know self entitlement selfishness rife come on, wearing mask zero effort. plainly wrong. Without virus deaths would happened, direct result virus effects. Here’s thing, *IS* BODY! DON’T GET FORCE ANYONE ANYTHING. car comparison bad faith argument. car forced face everywhere? Stop petty tyrant. quote Philip K. Dick: ""Reality which, stop believing it, go away."" 10,000 actually deserved it. Yeah support troops screaming much hate kneeling anthem troops die forced wear mask they'll open fire National Guardsmen try enforce stay home curfew, remain silent Vanessa Guillen never anything help local VA veterans charities show much support troops! Quite stretch there, bucko.

Try staying topic next time. wear mask, wash hands, touch face, keep distance people... [here’s another report different Yeah many Confederates died? Consider executed secession. Ok everyone mentioned old.. saying that's still lot ppl higher risk. caseload Singapore really quite low days. One benefits getting numbers control frees resources devote important matters. That’s literally opposite post. I’m criticizing fact US accepts 480,000 deaths smoking every single year. France shit show right now, good point comparison. countries manage pandemic well, countries don't. USA France part well. Let's kid Ummmmm think mean 6,418,500 deaths WW2. Holocaust victims dont count u anti-semite!!!!! health yours.

That's funny, source current pandemic that's killed 1m+ people again?  analogy totally nonsensical sorry. deaths arent caused covid 19, caused side effects response. type response inevitable consequence pandemic, decision made human beings. virus dictate every policy media announcement made, cannot attributed virus. virus decide halt cancer screenings ""non essential"" health treatment. 

At end day virus cause excess deaths, like hit car all. car causes deaths analogy. got virus died hospital analogy would hold true significant chunk excess deaths didn't. 

A accurate analogy would like ambulance running three people eight miles away car crash blaming deaths car crash. maybe are. make sure healthy food place everywhere get rid cheap options.

Those cheap options killing America chlorinated chicken hormone-drenched beef. 

Since walked walk, what's obesity rate areas? communities like would almost certainly left behind. 

They'd form co-ops organise better food supply 

Can think options? thing ""socialist"" absolute braindead plan fund regressive VAT tax, good idea principle going fund ludicrous way conceivable Good see traitors flags flying around...why excess deaths may due lockdowns quarantines. Hear out. lot people afraid going hospitals/doctor offices (myself included). Specially first starting, lot people turned away hospitals unless dire emergency. 

That, coupled suicides due economic turmoil, may explain increase excess deaths. assume report reporter’s region. sake adding reports communal conscience:

that doesn’t mean instances. doesn’t mean suspected instances. means data sufficient make claim. Oh yeah see mean Yeah bad covid case number drastically inflated Wait, “most conservative” estimate 1% dying? casually slip outright lie get upvoted?

Paying less tax shitty mostly legally. people go straight hell. trying kill family. lot charged murder. respect fact made effort go vegetarian. Every bit helps. Every step forward step forward.

 think important note wrong thinking vegetarian contributing animals killed. dairy industry perhaps horrific industry them, looked it? consider unfathomable quantities slaughter horrific treatment chickens egg industry...

I genuine grateful making efforts make difference. important acknowledge vegetarianism (as in, maintained consumption dairy eggs) absolutely directly contributes funds massive amounts slaughter suffering. Less meat eater contributes, yes, vegetarianism means still actively participating violently cruel animal exploitation industries. hope, saddens many people view inevitable bad thing.

Evidence is growing preventative benefits public health protocols coronavirus, social distancing wearing facial masks, new report Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) highlighting widespread enforcement health protocols resulted substantial decrease new cases.

Officials Arizona Department Health Services (ADHS) [studied daily COVID-19 cases seven-day averages January August following imposition lifting stay-at-home orders state.

 reopening social spaces economic sectors, ADHS officials reported 151 percent increase number daily cases, rising 808 June 1 2,026 June 15. 

On June 17, state officials began enforcing mask-wearing select cities counties, impacting 85 percent population. Public events limited, spaces like bars, gyms, movie theaters closed again. Restaurants operated limited capacity.

By early July, new cases began stabilizing, July 13 August 7, new daily cases fell approximately 75 percent. 

“Widespread implementation enforcement sustained community mitigation measures informed state local officials’ continual data monitoring collaboration help prevent transmission SARS-CoV-2 decrease numbers COVID-19 cases,” report read. also noted combination voluntary enforceable public health measures worked better preventing transmission single measure. 

The report notes data Arizona may representative U.S. states. Regardless, concludes enhanced mitigation measures implemented within communities, especially prior availability vaccine.  *Yes can* make Trump best president killing american passes election? get see big deal likely outcome. Looks like got far. Thanks!

Nobody outranks safety... sir. Halloween, Thanksgiving... guys sure busy October part ""Not sure merit,"" ""Again, know true"" supposed debate? I’m half serious! know major cities mandates! Everywhere else... much. unfortunately city, DeSantis said fines, lot people stopped complying. there’s much do! see follows.

The goal get R\_effective 1 keep there, right? need 100% perfect vaccine happen. know (I'm sure math works), even 30% effective vaccine might sufficient, assuming significant changes human behavior. truth this... know doctors said hospitals putting covid cause death received ""covid funding"" covid death/treatment. saying highly contagious deadly, health care ""industry"" U.S. money driven highly political. could possibly tell lies telling. choose think otherwise, I'm going even try change mind. would waste time. They're definitely getting signals would think.... India active cases. go baseball game, live normal life. It’s sold Yankees game, although there’s friend left, there’s stranger right. everyone wants live normal life. What’s normal beer hotdog baseball game?

So mask comes off, stranger’s face two feet yours. Let spell you. You’re wrong. don’t care say, telling go f doesn’t effect me. You’re sad person.

Peace out, blocking you. wild west seven months. seen information Iran long time. That's one places watching. 

We seen sporadic reinfections everywhere - dozens worldwide confirmed. 1% population get good immunity significant effect spread. 

What watching cases - even so, deaths - rising place virus already passed. Many places world achieved herd immunity virus gone away. comes back, we'll know we're trouble. 

In approximately 7 months, happened anywhere. Evidence absence strong.

The case describing end confirmed reinfection, first reinfection I've heard died. surprising given been. still good piece information.

Thank translations. good info. aren’t one. we’re able go social events vaccine distributed high risk groups + still mask up, I’m 100% board that. Good idea. get a2 filter smell players.

I know couple high end restaurants started offering take delivery service spring, say they're well. One even better last year offered dining restaurant. You’d think 9 fucking months people would understand timeframe Covid works. New cases - lag - new hospitalizations - lag - new deaths. 

Yet every freaking time someone reports outbreak “BUT HOSPITALS EMPTY!”

What’s working class getting anything? Well much shorter article expected flair? Really?? Japan ""South Southeast Asia"" guys?? They're simply two different types global events implying false dichotomy. situation choices are

1. Business usual!
2. Shut everything down!

I'm sure Strawman fallacy, deployed bad faith political advantage. outsider seems Republican Party send taking stance wanting take almost mitigation measures means proposing shut everything down, led things politicization masks, completely inane.

It's equivalent equating sort universal healthcare Stalinism. 

An early article good job explaining [Thomas Pueyo's ""The Hammer Dance""](Coronavirus: Hammer Dance).

The reality range things nothing Hammer (total lockdown) done. Done cost effective, others less so.

This masks come in. cheap, disruptive, fairly effective. Physical Distancing harder (try shopping grocery store), expensive (to society whole reduced seating capacity such). Better sick pay requirements make easier anyone *might* beer infected stay home.

As outsider, would suggest whole lot federal government could *help* state governments respond effectively.

The obvious would federal procurement program, federal government buys PPE large quantities, resells states cost. Avoids states getting stuck bidding wars. would helpful, lockdown.

All measures would helpful, although cost:benefit much nuanced discussion. course educated enough understand prevalent slavery (and still is) rest world, correct? America drop bucket historical existence (albeit disgusting) practice? It’s funny people sit mobile phone calling Americans traitors practicing slavery 150+ years ago conscience awareness iPhone made. real. virus killing fat, old, malnourished people.

Even right, not, 26% americans 45+, 40% obese. 10% nothing.

This something actual psychopath would say y’all stop acting like really care cause y’all fucking don’t.

That's sad projection I'm seeing. ww2 USA deaths something around 290k point? know anything history wars told us school. much it? clinical trial got drug free like $50/visit That.... Seems lot lower month ago.

Someone posted 'effect' like Birthday effect, with, people likely die, die first, almost everywhere initial huge spike starts slope.

Anyone idea I'm talking about? I'd like read it. Hell 2000 veterans died covid.  basically wasn’t abunch white northerners coming guns free slaves? nothing prevent 20,000 employees getting sick COVID-19. wait days ""change mind"" send take leave deal Congress. 50% poison pills democrats earmarks swing states. ancestors this? Take deep born 1842 south Dixie line give fuck people age 50?

Life-years *matter* greatly - literally question *how much life taken earth.* average covid death right near life expectancy, whereas cars thing likely kill people whole lives ahead them.

Not mention rather unsavory topic - modern society, have, compared previous societies, able extend people's lives much modern medicine. great thing! means left large number people particularly susceptible disease like this. Keep mind like 40%+ US deaths aged care facilities. car wreck stats consistently gone kinds regulations laws protecting drivers passengers.

And yet they're *still* incredibly dangerous, society reject measures *which much less obtrusive coronavirus restrictions* comes vehicle safety - limits vehicle size, urban freeway removal, automated enforcement, low speed limits, strict licensing requirements, road diets, repurposing existing private vehicle lanes transit, bikes, walking, etc - list goes (don't *dare* question right-on-red). mean, fuck - kind crazy let people shoot 2+ ton missiles public time anyways. words FPS Doug, ""fucking lag piece shit!"" That’s actually pretty high number combat casualties. soldiers died due starvation sickness even reached battle, accurate rifles past war tactics, number combat casualties pretty high manage vaccine. way get rid lockdowns. need accept this. 400K total deaths. Deaths end 2020. die 2021. STORM BURGER FUELS Studios can’t theatres. It’s considered monopoly. That's relief least. Thanks letting know. I've seen horrific videos China impression animals skinned alive fur quality. can't get horrific images head :( I'm saying, argument young healthy say fuck go bar allowing power get free pass shit ass job helping constituents, shining blinding light cracks systems institutions exist serve people. 

Instead low wage idiots vote red candidates ""pro business"" liberals hate concept people making livelihood enjoy impact economy. that, late, they're party wants kind oversight planning consideration ensure average people small businesses actually get money resources need make shut down.

Now sounds like \*meant\* cost effective 'meat' source factory farming. That's different argument entirely. Qatar study suggests re-infections rare almost always mild/asymptomatic. couple cases West second infection worse first, probably selection bias, western system require genomic sequence show first second infections genetically different confirmed re-infection, one genomic sequence unless case serious. (The Qatar study contrast used timespan estimate re-infections, genomic sequencing) dudes comment humans worn masks build immunity viruses back day works all. I’m gonna comment comments aren’t worth it. wasn’t talking you. Politicians twist narratives gain TIME.

COVID real, level many would like believe. CDC, WHO, etc reaching consensus lethality condition well identifying highest risk. many ways single one sounds nice considered plain evil. embarrassing United States America current year. Absolutely - plenty middle ground 'Humans never, circumstance except self defense, harm animal' 'Kill want, we're top food chain, want'

That said, feel like lean towards 'What good excuse harm animal' 'Humans want' f people? fixated person debates all? hell wouldn’t warehouse ‘publican admin point Grains sand pile. got rid rollerblades sandals. fat asthmatic myself... um... scared me, honestly appreciate it.  right. i've trying get fit. wearing mask, taking extreme distance/isolation since march. 

the covid bad enough, fact could turn ~~trump~~ mass murderer different story. That's 10% tested people, though, general population. people get tested unless symptoms. Human beings goddamn stupid depresses me. actually fool pangolin connection false. blaming animals wet markets without evidence whatsoever first place. Tell said thank you, will. likely get nearly enough that. don‘t land go phase factory farming. Also people want pay lot meat.
Also still killing animals to? Would solve issue many more. Including animals would suffer get killed. people regularly grew frequently went Cincinnati, are/were exposed viruses residents Cincinnati.  really matter 4h, worked, ate, shopped Cincinnati exposure pandemic virus.

Catching virus based whether know farm hunt deer drive pickup truck. based exposed someone virus contagious, occurs far often high density population areas, well suburban exurban areas nearby.

My definition based exposure pandemic clusters. number people traveling urban center directly related distance urban center. People middle nowhere dont travel pandemic clusters bring disease back nearly much people live 20 miles away. agree you. U.S. political social systems make kind shutdown Vietnam, China, Korea, etc carried impossible. 

When China needed isolate Wuhan surroundings, cut every air train service city. set roadblocks manned police military highways roads around city. didn’t manpower roadblocks, tore roads.

Nobody left home weeks. Neighborhood committees delivered food medicine. Health workers visited every home multiple times symptom temperature checks.

I cannot imagine enough Americans would tolerate kind total lockdown days, let alone weeks.

Vietnam something similar whole country - movement all. federal government can’t that. theory states can, few, would.

I cannot even imagine city state U.S.
even able implement kind shutdown Australian state Victoria recently - one person per household allowed one hour per day buy food medicine within 5km home, night time curfew, etc.

Papa Orange 3 days, whilst Chris remains hospitalized news today saying he's okay, take days see gets better worse. would float back saying ""gets it, afraid swimming concrete boots on"". murder? Batch testing works better positive rate extremely low, positive rate goes becomes lot less efficient (either need re-test pool fewer samples together). think China hiding numbers, contact tracing aggressive that, either hide numbers announce movements every new domestic case effort test trace contacts, can't both. Ah, old Bridgegate scandal. Simpler times back then. cesspool /r/politics 2.0 man. Either buy hysteria craziness fully GOP fanboy trump lover. ridiculous. realize exact argument *oppose* lockdowns, right? I'm sure asking here. went business-as-usual March April would far Americans dead. basically going grocery shopping neighbors. community spread limited. Wearing mask added protection, mostly grocery store workers (way many got Covid - 5 relatively small city died end May).

Our scientific understanding static. course things change. base decisions best available information time utilizing accepted methodology. really good studies stuff February. March got little better. still one ever studied masks vs. bandanas disease transmission. July/August way data adjusted guidance accordingly.

This hard. Umm reason it’s called “novel”... Democrats taking hoax far! /S pandemic over, vote saw Florida? worry, hate us, too. Well you? /s That's true absolutely support industries voting dollar work. Look many vegan substitutes exist. veganism overwhealming, best. lot virus one thing common, people eating shouldn't. China got SARS thing happening 2002, learned? Nothing, continued eat shouldn't. really anything everyone still room, breathing air. glass created closed room, would protection, doesn't. partial wall particles go around stick someone touches it, transfer themselves.

It's much easier people wore masks. many Florida's voters live year-round? moved Canada UK basis ancestry. curiosity, looked whether could come basis (besides marriage). Nope! Also go US, New Zealand, Australia, pretty much anywhere Europe. Also Canada, one countries! Agreed. That's much better description. Stupid may harsh. think entertaining. live Florida heard ad radio today local bar/nightclub proudly announcing running full capacity covid restrictions masks. sounds like recipe disaster. Ok, imagine trump came forward presented plan governors unified plan shut could implemented state level. 

A global novel pandemic like issue country faced. Yes know states autonomous definitely unique situation. Honestly, think probably truth Reddit can't bare accept. boring. Conspiracies fun.

Life really exciting. Going Trump’s doctor’s standards, Christie “slightly” overweight. No, hasn't. fact scientists like Ralph Baric changed tune now, early ""debunking"" debunked now. seasonal

Citation required Numbers higher last time tried like boss.  hiring? Gret decision, time lift restrictions across country, none restrictions impact spread virus, delay inevitable far worse economic impact. Florida recovering pretty quickly economically virus cases flattened without extra restrictions. white paper Humane Society International

Absolutely bias there. fucked say recently infected republicans going need die covid get country take seriously. Kinda... 😅 people prefer learning hard way. firefighters look burnt house grieving family

""Well, least neighbourhood burn down. Great work Brooks! :D""

While fire still ongoing... make white house virus trendy twitter trump sees it? That's declarative statements like, ""In pretty much confirmed cases second time mild severity,"" work. 22 confirmations, 5 serious/more instense, 11 mild/less intense, rest unknown. 50%. flat spreading bad info can't arithmetic. Kayleigh

It's Alabama take normal name fuck shitty spelling. like blm protests? get first place?   
Why people least fit charge - charge? many know someone died corona? saw headline reaction was: worries, folks. I’m quite sure White House control. /s I'm someone thinks reaction Covid HUGE overreaction serious... people ... someone like Christi locking taking precautions though. Still, expect head back Walter reed within week.

breathing not? sound like need help, mean psychiatrist. redditors accepted fate long ago much would love free range grass fed steak widely available create supply problem higher quality meats take time energy produce? would subsequent effects price meat availability overnight ban factory farming? curious! going debate without masks? 

It's easier stay protected masks on, deal effort nonsense effectively gains protection. clear, I'm saying ""roid rage"" popularly referenced

The OP claimed ""roid rage"" said that's incorrect. post rather superfluous. go spread neighbours, families co-workers (just like Patient 45 White House Outbreak). That's fair everyone else. Public health hits everyone. Think missed point. Today ,wait tomorrow gonna better. Cases spiking Costa Rica, 1k day. Costarrican I'd advise wait go. One week later: Every single attendee Miami Dolphins game infected Covid 19 due HVAC system recycling air. thinking that. source fact we've pandemic 7 months handful reinfections. immunity lasted 3 months, world would look drastically different right now.

-George Washington miss part said don’t come contact high risk individuals regular basis?

At point accept this? seem accept fact India screwed 105,000 deaths couple months. countries, India solve problems. Wuhan first city struck virus recovered three months, could wish recovered back late march stupidly assumed virus came China actually also came US Europe. facts. Stop digging heads sand accept fact 105,000 died already due inept governance terrible infrastructure. try point countries' problems going change situation india. theyre white person wants lament masks, plenty people wear masks, live people wear masks also 5 cases dead fan buy season tickets next year. Oh, Yes China good exemple, guess like dictatorships.
""If leave home, vanish you.""
Of course worked dictatorship. also weld door shut try escape officer guard theres damn thing it...here #myfreedoms... Let's honest. We're really saving economy either. economy needs stimulus. nah can't that. Mostly young people problem probably assumed given bubble White House supposed get would low risk exposure.

He really underestimate dumb Trump cronies truly are. I've keeping events past month Trump regime sort brazenly escalating flirting disaster. figured he'd already somehow let anyone know truly sniffing fart gas. think seeing 2020 every group extremes may feel like majority, not. ❤️ sure care. thought follow up. Home Friday. Tested Sunday. Tuesday. negative. think I’m clear still monitoring. symptoms Stupid, weak minded. Never going happen. Get ready pandemics, frequently. Hopefully we'll fewer utter fucking idiots power next one comes. 94% people wearing masks ones need get covid along loved ones see nothing happens masks anything  WH says lot things. many turned true. Sure. let people die? sums things well. Hilarious americans love most, accountability... Surprised 100% already. :P week, yes. Staring deeply abyss that.

Scream rather stare, then. wheeze, wheeze..... blood clots say, I'll see raise lung mold :) Omg, thank seriously thought crazy idea. ""Why tf spamming PBS channels 24/7 emailing teachers assignments? Schools teach shit anyhow."" 10 times 10% 1. Pay attention class. Shit free state. costs like 30 bucks. daughter got today. directly, overweight people using food resources, taking fair share healthcare, generally less productive workforce , create waste average, tax sewer system bigger shits, take longer get ever fall need CPR... way indirectly harmed likely die people overeating. [investigation independent audit company looking handling pandemic private public care fact knowledge care hygiene sufficient large mobility among staff affected ability protect residents. Lack access protective equipment employees also addressed, well fact measures stop infection introduced late sometimes.

But cop out. serious critique *Sweden* elected representatives handled pandemic. disaster waiting happen, degree happened every seasonal flu epidemic.

There literally *hundreds* investigations looking situation nursing homes home care. results investigations reflect poorly politicians responsible current situation, care homes owners mainly. 

And again, Tegnell regarded hero. (mostly) respected civil servant job. one guy tattoo represent Swedes think. Certainly sub. constant need single people heroes jobs seems American me. Ehhh, I'm sure possible. mean Newsom absorb food directly hair, us normal human beings cannot. 1000 tests? Let ask you-- would opinion ban would height smoking? Sonare guys plan stop going record? agree well, shutdowns huge failure. Im Los Angeles lot businesses grew shut permanently. pretty bad businesses survived housing bubble/recession last 6 months shutdown. Small business owners hit hardest this.

I shutdown beginning, throughout summer, noticed people ultimately gave became complacent, changed tune. critical point us back march needed stand together, lock short period time, take social distancing virus prevention seriously else. there, could opened fraction capacity. people, effectively. governor different strategies handle gonna go indeed fuck up. democrats Republicans guilty especially states high population. 
My biggest issue leadership federal government especially Trump. many opportunities focus best get involved state use Twitter superpowers lift people crazy times. Unfortunately opposite caused huge discord among people picked sides based voter base. protests happened, chose pick side based voter base drew line sand. Trump fully responsible coronavirus entering country protests/riots breaking out, responsible throwing gasoline situations. worst death toll western society trump's fault matter way try slice situation. least, might cut president slack least tried unite people didnt. 

I agree lock downs failure compact living definitely cause well. people also hold responsibility foolish behavior decisions well. Trump guilty meeting standards expect president thing power help change.

If read this, gotta say appreciate lot. fun talking arguing you. *Have daily requirement fiber?* Color surprised. Platte Walmart exactly good reputation. mean back August 2 women brawl social distancing.   that's including cases they're ruling pneumonia various diseases causes. true death numbers likely 10 fold. Agree, comparing wars affect select amount soldiers disease affects whole population useless.
People 5 months ago I'll repost argument there: 


US Defense Casualty Analysis System (DCAS) says 58220 people died Vietnam.
While according CDC 220000 280000 die monthly different reasons.
So kind wrong comparison conflict localised one relatively small country virus.
Even compare Vietnam something like influenza holding up. season CDC estimates that, mid-March, 29,000 59,000 died due influenza illnesses.
Imagine half whole Vietnam happening every year mundane disease. Yes obvious vaccine 0,01% damage compared virus itself. wont convince people take regardless facts. public needs enough trust believes procedures taken this. ask take flight plane checked mechanics 30 minutes instead usual 6 hours, i'd say ""hell no"" too. Eventhough chances dying plane accidents close 0%. U get point... Article calling CFR (case fatality rate), mortality rate. IFR (infection fatality rate) accurate deadly pathogen is. IFR estimated based serological studies, lot unknown regards T-cell immunity test sensitivity. CFR really true number given. defending article all. saying, everything beyond estimate. Masks already fashion China. Fauci step fashion? Chinese people definitely communal revere elders, rather treat disposable economy destroyers. definitely pragmatic beliefs greater respect science. But, many virus control measures utilized Chinese government would passed muster democratic society. combination people government got virus control. mostly compulsory. Anyone able bodied age required fight end war. sign literally hunted squads me. often executed. wasn’t often case Conscription Act 1862. hopkins puts 800+ today? Yes. concerned like experts familiar are. Yeah. Living FL seniors largely ignorant actual facts data. Life moves fast (we got one newfangled cell phones, work? *Proceeds show screen like 124 tabs chrome open*) watch Fox News like destroying brains.  LiFe’S mAtTer HeRe! Vietnam become independant 1945 French left. history book, American interfere southern voting first election side country caught civil war America directly involve 1962 turn America - Vietnam war. 10k deaths actually died covid-19, according CDC. wanna get crazy timeline :( 2020 wild years arbitrary concept. Nothing really changes dec 31st jan 1st... I'm optimistic 2021. Dude shows middle corn field. Socially distancing complied with. Oh look, lockdown skeptics again. Everyone constantly screwing up. new measures absolutely nothing decrease rate infection screw lot people’s income. Many friends got back work scarred without work again. One might even end homeless.  great job! good one :) Died with. allowed? Mods plz delete Honest question, American. Urgency bill aside, won’t whoever becomes president next pass relief bill? 

Or chance bill won’t passed he’s elected? US, world class healthcare best treatments, zero cost.

(Only president avoided taxes) Wearing masks nothing it. wear one constantly. Doesn’t bother me. bothers millions eventual evictions, hundreds thousands small business forever closing doors, pandemic hunger, suicides, child abuse, depression anxiety etc etc, come lockdowns. Yes Covid real, yes potentially deadly, yes masks work, lockdowns disruption existence stop, stop soon. know mean. I'll pass senior mods. I'm literally new guy. 🤷🏼‍♂️ easier believe Chinese achieve coerced. easier west believe accept entire population simple selfish bastards never looks greater good. 

Nope, Chinese handle virus better simply understand situation, willing give certain rights period time exchange public safety.

People trust goverment, epidemiologists. Masks mandatory indoor areas almost month many people still refuse wear them. fine wearing mask ranges non-existent merely equivalent 10 bucks consistently caught. *Millions* dying lockdown, huh? Get grip. Yes measures small lockdowns regional government put place seam worked much better. looks like health areas decreasing infected.

But saying areas small 5 infected less makes enough difference drop 1000 mark.

I personally think increase many ppl came back holiday brought mit infection them. Makes sense Trump patient zero. He's common thread tell. Simple. They're blaming Pelosi, AOC, one's hurting Trump GOP.

That Fox News spin crazy. got app. Let’s hope never need use it. keep imaging trump shitty Duke Leto Atreides going around poison gas tooth killing everyone around. God damnit Seems like read twitter thread goes present evidence whatever waste argue quite clear allergic evidence contrary preconceived notions. Sad downvoted.

RemindMe! 2 months faire mind asking? cancelled Ohio's . What's **statical %** still get COVID 19 **6+ feet apart(say time less 6 feet)**, wear mask?

By statical, absolutely make sure speculation, guess, estimate whatever. Need backed HARD science research! exaggeration another way lying. lie. can't trusted. like Trump.

Finally, like someone else mentioned BLM protests well masked affairs. Nearly universal compliance every protest I’ve attended.

Please tell me, oh wise centrist, Democrats supposed McConnell ""The Grim Reaper"" (the nickname gave himself) made clear reasonable stimulus package signed law. I’ve seen friends family. isolated, tested negative group friends family, went long backcountry trip. also see people outside household wearing mask staying apart. get coffee friends way. It’s hard.

Yeah feel like really easy mistake make anybody's perspective. single important person planet, would assume he's tested daily, multiple times per day. Even though makes sense now, retrospect absurd idea assume Donald Trump, humongous baby, would willing endure unpleasant tests daily. Ah, insist judging people wearing gloves.

As said, although skin high resilience normal, sensitive skin. 

Eczema ""average person"" thing have. Psoriasis ""average person"" thing have. Developing allergies overexposure average thing people West (*and go pause global pandemic*). Allergies water rarer general population much common develop people working hair salons restaurant professions. 

And people happen open sores hands number reasons might want drench alcohol. 

But mind reader see false sense security inside people. apologise I'm people claim mind readers. Christie sacrificial pawn, groupie Florida 720,117 cases 14,766 deaths.

More like 25K deaths. undercount massive there. Yeah? Watch kids. Kisses handshake/slaps 1:1 every get together. think every country test anyone coming country vaccine 40% world population gotten it. He's ""fine"" interview yesterday hands lips blue they're purple reason. infuriates whenever hear type shit. like gonna murder someone cold blood like simply asked wear mask? it’s like guy forcibly trying put mask patron’s face. already hate anti-maskers passion.. takes another level Trump went rally state day tested positive. Without ever wearing mask, course. Patient ~~Zero~~ Nero try hard hate people like this, feel sympathetic stories, can’t it. someone incapable protecting sheer, stubborn, ignorant repudiation deserve pitied?

Are stupid good it’s sad? contemptibly stupid? Florida abolished capital punishment. 

DeSantis fully deserves death penalty point, well trip Hague that, crimes humanity committed. 

Of course, applies president, administration, majority congress, much corporate ""leaders"" telling do. 

But holding breath expectation seeing properly punished crimes... Actually normalcy routine common managing alzheimer's. Secure alzheimer facilities europe often set villages shops inside. People live partments look like houses.

With lack routine become agitated anxious.

So Trump Sr thinking office actually pretty smart. point apologize mistake unhook ventilator lack compassion seems common trait amongst certain party reason. wonder particular group attractive people them... f’n stupid? biggest change forced work home going gym. go shopping twice week(once make stop way gf's house every Friday). dont mess curbside delivery. Mask use hand sanitizer after. Go dinner parents week. either cook get delivery/take week. parents older going eat restaurants last couole months, won't. Besides that, go fishing herping weekends. Besides grocery trips dr visits. Cabelas store gone ""Well times dicks fuck assholes""

This guy, all. calculations behind bright. really gain much anything, necessary, hurt reputation caused lots trouble. beef always taste better, 

Only that's used to. Like people love skim milk others hate based they're used tasting. GOOD.  think people zombies programmed whatever says? Maybe independent thought think restrictions government overreach like businesses forcibly shut down? Oh no, they're mindless drones ape whatever Trump does. need everything table. Masks, social distancing, improved hygiene, vaccines, improved therapeutics. need bring together next 6 months. Watch game changers friend;) listen tapes Bob Woodward, think big deal. want \*you\* think big deal. available contact publicly? questions says towards end could avoided, shut borders (and let Chinese in...).

Almost sounds like Trump. doesn’t seem realise virus circulating around world mich earlier. Shutting borders February wouldn’t helped. Maybe January.

A ton teenagers find work elsewhere havent already. then, sure, people deserve get laid get laid off. everybody else? They're ones fucking us movies years. *Fuck them.* we're discussing ""missing"" cases, either deaths asymptomatic survivors. 

We're talking hard numbers people *were* diagnosed outcomes. security theater, like every American dealing workplace I'm starting think guy hates Florida. Murder: “the unlawful premeditated killing one human another.”

Does sound like murder? admit sides equal, republicans wrong, violent literally killing us response, top lowest rolling coal NRA supporter? I, one, welcome $50/ticket Disney exclusive theaters can't see Disney movies anywhere else. Honestly I've always looked Italy Canary NYC hard-hit Western locations.

The Italians got slammed first made way through, handled better many surrounding territories months after. now, trying breathe life back economy relaxing bit much, numbers going back (not extent France, Spain etc., still).

But yeah, good mask mandate, hope rein in. wellbeing parents, grandparents, teachers, uncles, aunts, neighbors matter? long safe, good?

Selfishus, begonicus! can. VOTE!  numerous zoonotic diseases past came Western farms.

It self evident reducing animal consumption decrease chances another pandemic arising animals. Solutions always proportional problem. cut nose get rid pimple. Proportional response requires delicate balance moving target well. point shutdowns intended early buy time, enhance hospital capacities, develop therapeutics, etc. plan never delusional scenario cases all. would impossible. I'll remember 80 seeking medical care. ""you've got 10 years left, go home die."" kinda reminds old saying - ""Lie dogs, wake fleas"". majority outbreak cases southeastern WI near milwaukee - many suburbs ALSO considered major subarbs Chicago area commuters. cool - wish death people. millions people comorbidities country. willing lose them? need take care sacrifice. can't force millions people stay home indefinitely due selfishness others. reinfections known severity majority mild asymptomatic. Since know severity much cases they're irrelevant discussion. nah lets normalize shit, countries interest right shift blame away disastrously responded pandemic. course one asks virtually countries Asia managed responded easily without devolving chaos happened west.

I mean difference Yeah, “Anti-fascists”, tho!

I’m truly scared though another fellow human, wish recovery. confront people without masks

Good call. want tell put mask airborne now, jackass. murder people, wear gd mask. hard. Selfish morons. r/sino specifically talking nature paper.
 used silence people months, fact, told impossible engineer virus looks natural, way sars cov 2 manipulated lab. Ralph Baric, worked Wuhan lab engineered chimeric viruses, recently contradicted this. genuine knowing lab leak, thread covers rationale behind lab leak theory gives decent sources. suggest look Alina Chan Richard Ebright twitter want insight. Multiple credible scientists/people come pointed discrepancies official narrative.  Exactly. It’s Trump trying Biden debate. gonna bully participating yes yes. Biden refused he’d called wimp. give link? I've seen data vaccine trial indicate 50% effective.

The notes I've seen anywhere Modernas mRNA vaccine noting provided jsut good immune response elderly younger people. rich getting Remdesivir early - everyone else told stay home lay stomach. irrelevant. comparison deaths one event another.

eg) almost many people died 9/11 D-day landings. 3,000 4,000 respectively. short term problem. Michael Chrichton wrote *The Andromeda Strain* 1969. amarican, voted Trump. America one China bullshit, letting know. Definitely agree!!! like know that. Covid: both. Lmao guess really need put /s after, I? That's said. say ""oh learned changed mind""

He specifically stated downplayed helpfulness masks people buy wanted health workers adequate ppe. noble goal, still lied. trump replaced biden Sure it'd great seeing resistant people vaccines already doubt we'd get everyone participate- plus even tested children yet. sure help, people still get sick die vaccine, especially elderly people people diabetes health issues. people need know therapies treatments keep hospital vent resume daily lives. sure matters. simply comparison Covid killed x, WW2 killed y. Nothing that. way people relate scale something, comparing another well known event. Word. FB hard days. there'a way actually quarantine Florida rest country, look it.

For science. Touche, many protesters wearing masks. Floridiots refuse to. Cause he’s idiot? Seems simple enough understand (I'm Buffalo) mask. 2 previous beefs  different experience going Wegman’s, favorite supermarket chain. flagship store guys Rochester amazing. Dirty plebs can't behave right? less risk. still risk. 

And easy wash/sanitize, unpackage groceries. Even wit small risk, there's basically drawback. wish somebody could shut Trump down. sort country.. Good luck. They’ll gouge prices high well could afford it. places got hit almost saturation, North. 

The bulk states still relatively low seroprevalence.

Not matters much, course, given likely immunity short-lived. Republicans ok that, actions indicate anything different. confusing death numbers, death rate. assuming even looking legit numbers rather political fearmongering propaganda. That’s specified US. family given fat check handover passwords. real cost business ethical ways lot Americans expect, absolutely right least. worry guys, we're gonna accept deaths want reopen economy. words! People losing businesses government plan control virus. Hospitals dangerous large people. uncle close 500 lbs fell equipment leaning broke. ended braking bone died surgery fix it. US combat deaths 1941 1945. answer looking but. sorry info. (average 100k/yr) Ouch. AI would actually construct complete sentences elected leaders voters want? way politician enact sort law people would despise for. Change needs come consumer.

Politicians try represent people. Corporations try supply products meet demands. one way things change given two facts. honesty meat years. said, perspective sake animal would look small scale farms around willing splurge something special (because probably get subsidies artificially lower prices). Ask practice regenerative agriculture, permaculture, whatever sustainability practices cows beneficial extremely detrimental depending practice. Ask range cows birth death--as pretty much beef cows started grass finished feedlots--and slaughter site, local abbatoir, industrial slaughterhouse there's increasing risks ethical issues one.

So basically find local farm ask sustainability, care, slaughter life cow. buying store, wanna let know longer federally protected mean anything grassfed ate blade grass point maybe, unless verify choose want spend potential accurate. Also feedlot cows fed legally almost think of, including cow blood, pigs, horses. practically impossible verify life cow buying typical grocery, really recommend going small scale direct relationship farm can.

Population-based studies produce estimates number Iraq War casualties ranging 151,000 violent deaths June 2006 (per Iraq Family Health Survey) 1,033,000 (per 2007 Opinion Research Business (ORB) survey). survey-based studies covering different time-spans find 461,000 total deaths (over 60% violent) June 2011 (per PLOS Medicine 2013), 655,000 total deaths (over 90% violent) June 2006 (per 2006 Lancet study).

You. Don't. Deserve. Kindness. Well no, you’re right. Scientifically speaking, pandemic ends infections drop certain transmission rate. pandemics also social problem/disruption. aspects end decide don’t care anymore accept risk. 

So that’s trend pandemics fading public’s radar actually end scientifically. Well likely back 2019 levels interaction much actual pandemic (we kind now) Using line thought, think peer reviewed think dosage impacts severity; already done validate masks work. So, waiting peer reviews, equally convinced dosage impact. did

Hurry get glitch fixed China, I’m going start upvoting these! 2 months symptom onset, two thirds adults non-critical COVID-19 complaints, mainly anosmia/ageusia, dyspnea asthenia. prolonged medical follow-up patients COVID-19 seems essential, whatever initial clinical presentation. ""It's strange set ""anyone China may possibly know them"" seems include people tirelessly cheerlead actions country's government. ""

Bullshit. cheer leading ccp me, asked question explained quite clearly yet refuse listen explanation really interested answer, trying make incorrect point. That's bad faith.

As last paragraph, absolutely agree put right report it, hope banned. zero reason behave way. Massive amounts pilfering profiteering rationed goods went well. things never change. one involved Pfizer study got booster shot month ago would test positive antibody test? wondering. understand need control group BTW. New York state whole 33,000 deaths. New Jersey 16,000 deaths. almost testing February. news broke ""first"" community transmission New Rochelle, likely already 100,000 cases Covid spreading unchecked city. NY/NJ dense. first week March, almost everyone went business normal. reason everyone thought Covid still Asia. later know better. imagine much spreading NY's subway system. one small pro-mask protest though.

I guess must confused Norway Finland anti-mask protests. links age data, although anecdotally articles I've read (that talk organ damage fatal blood clot) tend cover people 20s 40s.

Here's article potential long-term damage: named five dead students, ghoul. People dying lying. friends get decide pandemic over. say say done masks, say hello ventilators. Jalen who? never heard dude. city (Beijing, China), COVID-19 testing (formerly CT) mandatory febrile patients go hospital inexpensive (test costs $4 individual $25 CT) results available within 24 hours!

Hopefully, city same.  22 people counting contact Trump positive. refusing quarantine, tracing, masks. 

I guess long primarily killing dense Democratic cities, people color, consider campaign strategy.

Imagine experience emergency unconscious, awake crushing debt, wish come back life. Speaking experience going ""back normal"". history remebered pre-covid post-covid. Look great reset.

Also, takes years develop monitor safety vaccine. believe effective safe vaccine produced virus infectious affevts nearly every cell body, anti-science HOORAY! Justice served! funny🙄 Generalizations usually true, mine comes seeing person say.

Not complaining feel free generalize dont care wanted point hypocrisy poster ""im better attitude"" simply ignorance masked assurance. Stephen Miller tested positive! can't wait go trick-or-treating! Adams told officer visiting Hawaii...and **didn’t know parks phone number Adams gave officer number Adams listed email state officials **seeking exemption Hawaii’s quarantine arriving travelers.**

Caught lie. Based truth-pilled I've lost 2 jobs, one 4 one 7 years. evicted home 11 years evictions stopped. 16 days late rent gave landlord notice going well rent due. get unemployment work 1099 jobs. Lost 3 cats years. Lost everything carry me. I've never seen first stimulus check, doubtful second would find me. Winter cold Iowa predicting lots snow average temperatures year. I'm worried it. ya been, doc? \*spring. think college kids violating protocol now, wait come hibernation spring break next year. Bad bot reason lie this. man Amish devastated. saying told me. Numerous nurses also told patients die covid , hospitals reported could collect $30,000 would receive case. actual Fuck?! ok let go selfish friend's especially placing risk. Coronavirus channels Glenn Close Fatal Attraction: I'm going IGNORED! Seriously, lost better half 20s severe Lyme Disease. I've lived much life since like time waste (unless I'm willingly wasting time). Life meant living fullest, hiding fear years end. would willingly die relatively quickly shitty illness instead cowering fear months end, refused already. lost job March I'm job hunting hitting trails hardcore, I've hiked hard summer fall lost 12 lbs without trying. 

People want Coronasplain life I'm going hear even willing figure I'm coming from, want scream great virtue signaling. welcome stay home long want, I'm going leave house live life. get sick die, it, better getting sick something even attempt kill leave mostly bedridden years. there, done that. want add effective contact tracing might effective lockdowns (at least ruining economy). South Korean Taiwan never true lockdown really excelled contact tracing. Extortion, blackmail Honestly point it’s question if. Great answer. know much long term impacts children anyone does. live Kensington right middle Red Zone, pray me. already covid, I'm totally scared I'll get First all, diabetes Covid. actually, hypothetical example, would still attributing death diabetes well. one condition. pick. assume diabetes understood fully known treatments (which Covid not) low chance killing someone. wrong. top that, bowel infections actually well known treatments. Heck, surgery day baby gastroschisis since state fully point Covid precautions, baby therefore much better prognosis baby article.

Diminishing Covid ""just contributing factor"" serve medical community public welfare well all. pre-existing condition. one born it. benefits right wing populist agendas though. Fact: Social distancing works. allows us delay cases deaths til vaccine. joke thinking effective social distancing protocol (lock down) would work! reason spiked allowed lock lift.  hell states allowing full capacity bars hot spots pass virus?  economy important it’s tough balance, don’t get virus control economy never come back much worse today. They're already that, vaccines serious chance approved mass manufactured. However, actually distributing everyone massive logistics issue, can't produce infinite vaccines per second. See: Wendover video Regeneron's antibody cocktail still clinical trials widely available. information pricing. Huh, know vampires could get Covid.  Amish man whose wife died lied this?? would he?

Definitely Reddit karma. I’m Michigan governor little bit overboard want give benefit doubt. yeah isn’t gonna go away. We’re veitnam haha  Let spell you:

1. Canadian Conservatives within realm current Republican party policy, values, public image. black white. Right vs left. two parties completely different environments.

2. one (either side) supplied meaningful information support claim, subjective bs.

3. ‘Conservatives evil’ narrative largely championed liberal fanboys unable hold viewpoint past ‘one good, bad’. cant infer political stance alone, stating wrong - indicates feed binary viewpoint - point things arent binary. Perhaps clarify then, ‘yer wrong lol’. 

4. called liberals may read post get triggered thinking Conservative bashing liberal ideals.

5. Stop trying play ‘image’. web forum anonymous users. Im sure would look worse to, speaks volumes personality. 

In essence: go f yourself. lot people genuinely believe things back normal everywhere besides US reason. ""In United States, 1952 polio epidemic worst outbreak nation's history, credited heightening parents’ fears disease focusing public awareness need vaccine. 57,628 cases reported year 3,145 died 21,269 left mild disabling paralysis.""

I think 210k dead good reason stay home... stock market keeps falling reverse course wealthy donors start complaining. 

Also sees stock market measure success make change course possibly.  would assumption would really like know fact: many people received treatment success rate. Availability etc etc. Lockdowns don’t necessarily require keeping people locked apartments. degrees restrictions fall short that. hospitals actually get point beds full people lined triage see enforced lockdown description. Hope doesn’t come that. certainly come game virus. people accepted possibility okay it. love grandparents even (89, 82, 78) don’t want rot away house forever chance country lmao North Georgia never really shut definitely happening here. entire countries fewer active cases White House. deniers spout “only 10k” died “only” covid crap Well said Fauci wish Stephen Miller's case gets worse.

I hope lungs fill fluid.

I hope internal organs weakened.

I hope go respirator.

I hope filled pants shitting, mind numbing terror agonizing, imminent demise.

Because would *wrong*.

So I'll simply say is. Yes. also need make sure leap whatever animal humans. searching origin critical too. quibbles San Francisco need remember really good masks thankful. I’ve never witnessed heard sort behavior here. Occasionally see runner runner without mask. people chin diaper thing see they’re walking towards they’ll pull up. How? president said that’s how. That’s lot people need. Well told, wife die covid. bill forgiven sign paperwork stating did. say death certificate. looks incredibly stupid look “Experts information outcome every infection. However, early estimates predict overall COVID-19 recovery rate 97% 99.75%” I’ll take chances surprise active cases White House New Zealand. American, I’ll say this: time it. don’t want rock boat closer what’s going here. It’s goddamn dystopia. Czech Republic “only” 789 deaths little 87,000 cases. live smaller country smaller population, rank average quality life metrics. Certainly far better majority places country right now. virtually nothing straining break guidelines, compared United States. country fairing pandemic relatively well, you’d great service keep contributing — taking away it. Wear mask around others, social distance, wash hands, binge watch Mandalorian leading October 30th. No. Humanity survived millennia even though spread colds flu.

Michael D. Shear Trump says it''s like flu, except experimental antiviral medications breathing treatments. must true, right? agreed. think buy it. experimental medicine. need VIP like president. cant believe people really believe country population billion everything control. Nothing regarding politics government effective matter what. order take out? Better lose GDP millions people.

We always print new money, can't raise dead Covid. Thanks: You’re best! thus infected hundreds.  That's kind point. open 99% people either asymptomatic recover home need go hospital, there's capacity deal people get sick.
Its ""lets show liberals"" there's entire industries place like FL built around tourism entertainment much burns nuts, people can't live $1,200 9 months

If high risk, stay home. regularly encounter people high risk, stay home. Otherwise go.
400,000 people went Sturgis, nobody wore masks 1 guy died willfully chose go. cheap harleys sale. phrase nothing tautology. media caked layers upon layers connotation simple phrase like somehow becomes reprehensible. Teach non-English speaker English present phrase ""it is"", they'll look quizzically respond ""Huh? course. Things are."" think need taught science is. Look countries like south Korea, New Zealand Vietnam, fine. protect vulnerable need stop spread let go population. Letting go population result countless unneccesarry deaths wish job like that... sounds really challenging rewarding. Latest news vaccine testing delays starting look like something fishy going on. I'm starting think US going getting vaccine anytime soon. honestly think narcissism. cannot fathom world revolve around exact situation. Dr Fauci hero. Anyone disbelieves worth considering. stupid, selfish lost cult. shunned. Bartender here.


I dont confront anti mask people much get paid enough deal this. tips significantly worse people coming demanding even though also serve tables barback short staffed.


I anything bad story happen yet, fear trump ""recovered"" going embolden people even something help others isn’t virtue signaling decent person part society. It’s undermining science come White House. State governments going input. read one. looks like adds perspectives agricultural argument good polarizing one way other, imo, prevents progress useful direction. I'll add list.

In scheme animal agriculture, actually reminds two books read yet subject, curious. *And Waters Turn Blood* touches industrial pig farming water pollution associated and, like essentially textbooks stuff, *Waste West: Public Lands Ranching* says.

Sustainable ag hugely complex still early resurgence (since lot practices actually old indigenous practices given areas). agree animals always part humans diverse, also believe things like stockfree regenerative agriculture/permaculture biocyclic vegan agriculture (a certification that's easier find info former two) key players. Sustainable ag going vary widely depending region country world large because, looks like book gets at, also culture humanity. Social, environmental, economic sustainability important. Honestly I've learned far, think industrial ag going part sustainable agriculture, ag needs decentralized IMO. one right wrong way, exploration ""best"" ways always ongoing...but research seem clear (IMO) drastically need cut back consumption. fit beyond cutting back vary place place person person.

I've got sources stockfree old mini-lit review undergrad anyone interested. new field never really considered necessary, looking hopeful thus far. Unfortunately, typical rhetoric new research overall, really easy read books yet. get dense, y'all know. I'm copying relevant bib:

Problem people like think Black White.  nothing outbreak September 

It sowed seeds public behavior, pretty sure people got careless, resulted 2nd wave. that's like small town.

And yet end this.  legend goes Really, it’s laughable think see rational part, you’re trying justify wildly harmful morally unjustifiable actions. 

There’s basically good justification keep consuming animal products day age truckload reasons stop so.
If terminantly animal torture, exploitation suffering extremist, please keep calling extremist - whatever helps sleep night. 

I see somehow got caught painful vegetarian/pescatarian/flexitarian/reducetarian/meat eater criclejerk.
You try outsource blame companies others eat fish, part actually belongs you. 7,8 billion people planet. one eats fish week like do, many fish think caught/killed year? A: 374,4 billion. btw, ever heard bycatch? weekly fish isn’t one animal killed hurt. Please urge educate massive issues related fishing, meat, animal product industries. Sometimes read title. Seriously, you’re like child wanders middle conversation frame reference. literally first paragraph title:

“This megathread discussing news related President Trump’s positive Covid-19 diagnosis treatment, well positive test results senators political figures related current outbreak.” can't compare US countries like Sweden. actually follow scientists listen social distancing guidelines. everyone US followed social distancing guidelines beginning, would much better position far less deaths. 

The lesson? Americans learn matter lesson is. elections decided thousand votes happen always go Republicans. know, woke vomiting morning first thought wish someone share with. poor find it’s Corona maybe friends work help figure out. bandana keep safe. point. makes good point saying media would treated hillary clinton differently similarly cryptic circumstances feel like people always existed, ONLINE now. internet computing recent mostly delegated curious intellectual, I've never issue. envy them. could too. Florida worst state union It’s pretty trivial public service announcement style tweet. Conservatives usual fake outrage thing again... fair, Trump able walk flight steps without help spoke camera minutes, even visibly gasping air. He's got symptoms, obviously mild case.  Trump tax cuts PPP abuse means trickle economics...right? might want think still slogging ass fast food.  
Nope mate. 
I used part time support Masters Robotics. ;)  


Now crawl back hole contemplate life.  


I chose whine something it. Supply shortage N95 too. yeah hospitals cutting cost mostly reason lack PPE. county. surgeon know going less dangerous flu. One friends, dentist talking numbers faked KN95 inferior? Trump demands total allegiance Chris Christie standing president worth life. 

Of course probably also assumed president well protected due testing such. Nobody’s really ever accused Christie genius. Give quality healthcare average american joe make bills proportional much joe charged. Month ago, government insisting provide 25K tests per day. cannot even that. test 12-14K people per day. Yesterday, 14100 tests, today maybe 18K, still 1/3 proposal given 4 weeks ago. Absolutely, keep away em best ya can. punch, one wash hands ASAP!! Lol went office depot website. 

N95 stock people know think like turn around excuse Trump playing pandemic avoid panic. understand it. realistically though due climate change crisis stuff factory farms factory like food growing skyscrapers s*** going feed people Avengers endgame event movie
These type movies best watched theater setting
This dont want theaters die
First watch always want theater get audience reaction I’m pro choice person really appreciate saying this. It’s nice see people pro life rather pro birth. clearly care people. fucking serious? Wtf? don’t think NFL it, Gov DeathSentence sure trying live name. many things remember it’s ridiculous Guys, don’t take seriously. Dolphins haven’t ever 1/10 full stadium game. don’t care think, think China completely lying numbers zombie something “How dare take walk?!”  always bootlickers billionaires America rushing defense Congrats could give shit less personal choices. often hear Salmanilla problems produce? Almost atleast one two different occurances think happening per year US. make good point, understand may frustrating people may training, background, even time process streams data. certainly find sometimes conflicted since can' keep flood information, despite professionally involved healthcare industry unique access perspectives related COVID that. certainly imagine people hunting positive headlines trying make sense happening. merely offering perspective explaining why, people, negative stories, despite sometimes sensationalist, valuable formulate balanced view maybe inform personal decisions. Head Weibo eat buffet schadenfreude. Airbags, seatbelts, crash tests, expensive automakers. Maybe US automakers wouldn’t struggling much Detroit wouldn’t ghost town relaxed regulation. 

And clear, it’s coronavirus negatively affecting economy. Lockdown not, theaters restaurants would struggle pandemic. Lockdowns actually help economy stifle virus give consumers confidence. actually 99.98% who's counting? Sure. [San [South actually even frightening expected be.

I though would everyone infected April.

But way going population infected January, might even time additional reinfection wave March/April...

All Europe hard lockdown now. Instead schools open everywhere... realize China tried cover whole spread Covid? tried cover would months worth head start tackle problem. Yes, understood science, whey stay continue go down?  *authoritarism root evil 65,000 dead people. Mass murderer. want encourage *civil* conversations without political comments mods? Stop problem root, go tell president fucking boobs. Stop burying heads sand, sure sub covid whole post trumps behavior affecting folks already impacted covid. Grow up. also demand issue. Farmers cannot produce enough meat, dairy eggs meet current demand without factory farms. Phasing factory farming synonymous reducing eliminating consumption animal products. 
I support BLM anti-colonialism think inherently good ideas aware benefits born white wealthy Western country. 

But never want apologize woman white American atheist, imho don’t need feel responsible seem to. Working hospital, lot people believe seriousness virus they're exposed daily basis, also reasons believe seriousness high blood pressure diabetes diagnosis: problem becomes *massive* problem can't ignore health deficits never recover (i.e. heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, etc.). Yep, nobody thought would get care facilities badly has. Fomites much issue Coronas, groceries unit need sanitized. knowledge base would already know this. go... Amazing think FHM prioritized public health one would’ve died all. must think highly capabilities. country succeeded that. Agreed 

Well, France fucked. Thanks insight current count? 4 billion? Man, hope get started tats.... Weird...the majority comments trying justify actions person killed woman. Well, that's general predicament situations.

You warn people disaster could happen, listen you, happen, always idiots attacking ""alarmist"" worst happen

But happen quite likely (""you"" meaning scientific/public health community case) blamed failing prevent it.  Looks like Pattinson asymptomatic, Batman started production back late-September bloodsucking paparrazzi pictures kissing girlfriend, probably knew still contagious I'm sorry getting comments like this. evidence conflicts lot people's expectations. people learn it, others get angry. It’s beneficial ultra rich continue pull strings government developed countries regarding stimulus. course lockdowns don’t make sense government refusing job paying keep families businesses afloat. someone considers centrist isn’t hardcore decrying fucking EVERYTHING Republican Party right aren’t centrist, embarrassed republican. 

Yes; look bad things Democrats done Democratic Party done (of many). isn’t centrism, it’s whataboutism. Hold everyone accountable actions regardless political party clear views principles explain. That’s centrist. Spineless “well sides bad” bullshit kicking don’t actually come morales solutions problems. sit high horse judging people trying make things better.

Fuck, don’t agree conservative values, would much rather good faith conversation conservative listen one bullshit “well Democrats would thing position”. Well expect say something pissed Mark, let’s ignore whole fucking issue current representatives garbage. misleading title? *my* Reddit feed? seriously ramping testing Tourism big earner means economy completely dependent it. NZ could easily wait vaccines better treatments reopening borders still better debt GDP ratio lot western countries post uneducated spreading ignorance. Working home ""conviviale"" enough. 

Caution key think. Lockdown works, immediately going back normal afterwards doesn't. WI mask mandate. I'm sorry can't read look pictures information. picture represent Sweden, times, everywhere? mean, surprising considering dexamethasone suppresses immune function. Meanwhile Conservative Group suing Governor stop mask mandate... someone Republican Party tell threshold people getting sick dying actually take seriously? Cancer rates going we're better detecting it... still wrong regardless. correct post. Well suggest alternative? say fuck let million people die USA? me. Enjoying good life country home sweet husband. reason (and excuse) anything risky, don't. buy groceries every week 7:30 Safeway, otherwise avoid human contact. Phone calls, email zoom fine me. could long time. Official french government dashboard (I 100% sure whether dashboard official publication government experimental project, would still assume ass reliable media) allowing rich shit I’m choosing line pockets? Vote dollar. Surely cognitive capacity take personal responsibility impacts, well mailing legislators push policy change, no? don’t know it’s always either scenario. vast majority Jews aren’t like this. 

What protestors revolting, giving religion bad name actions. do. majority cases come Hasidic decided go head first herd immunity don’t respect restrictions. parties coalition Bibi’s Likud party don’t get much policing (not really control listen religious leaders happily clash police). lockdown :-( think wrong him, case? problem comparison behavior personal voluntary. Smoking kills individual (yes, know... second-hand smoke). virus given others unwillingly. it’s comparative. goes every behavior ultimately causes **self**-harm.

Plus there’s idea normalization. Coronavirus never goes away, even blink numbers. one death vector throw pile.  literally nothing consider it, it’s standard PPE dealing airborne virus. I’ve wearing mine since February.... Yeah give shit, still mean think fine. Like give shit someone dies car accident tonight, think fine happens. care people die every day, personal level? propose, exactly? Fuck idiots like this.

These stories become norm never, EVER learn. standards stringent matter politicians say.

If set high bar, even good vaccine side effects, would useless many people (not anti vax ppl) would refused take it. kinds idiots think Netanyahu “doing good job” miss eating food cooked home, much enjoy supporting businesses trade lives staff bucks.
 
Stay safe! Somehow surprise me. black probably illegal homosexual Poland. ""It is"" answer you. No. won’t get accurate figures big wig republicans it, much less “help”. Fuckin fake news lol. plenty politicians contracted COVID end hospital. think simplest explanation Trump Christie hospitalized sick enough necessary. never make everyone happy, even best thing health Yikes! I'm glad asked question.More research do. shit bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S funny turntables worry we're assimilated mindset process. Staring deeply abyss that. Mania characterized abnormally elevated irritable mood, intense energy, racing thoughts, extreme exaggerated behaviors. happy euphoria; absolutely manifest intense rage.

To clear, I'm saying ""roid rage"" popularly referenced. mania manifest rage. looking wrong:

A virus broke out. science proved utterly ineffectual it.

Your mind trapped illusion control. truth much matter do, do.

You make worse yourself, e.g. destroying lockdowns Ugh, sorry hear that. choice elevators (hard hold breath long!) I’m old lady. also enter bars restaurants probably won’t years. Don’t give money businesses ok killing make buck. know back normal would released video now. ""Give liberty minor inconvenience proven save thousands lives give COVID-19 death!"" Lol, almost 50 people full stadium already died covid, 1,300 gotten infected point going USA total percentages. president blackball anyone defies contradicts says. seems like matter mocked matter fired, blackmailed, blacklisted scapegoated.  Seems dumb end outside filter replaceable mask sterilized...  mine cost 150 bucks.

and know mediacal im using hepa filter bags pre-filter niosh k95 filters use. hell could implement sterile hepa filters used vaccume cleaners used throughout day potentialy multiple days... seems dumb me.

&amp;#x200B;

I working PAPR system form mask though. kind sucks breath filters extended periods. run hospital space bodies lining streets hell ban people working home ? 

I don’t think lockdown pointless. can’t tell many times people posted here, “if locked properly we’d getting back normal like countries” 

The countries even remotely well handful Asia/Oceania countries Look first picture article.. notion Swedes properly distancing bullshit. going lives normally. Wtf else do? Put bubble? Lmfao economy 

Economies implode anyways physical limits life Earth. example, keep dumping heat-trapping gases one single atmosphere life-supporting biological process upon depend destroyed. Like solar blast? people United States died already coronavirus died influenza past five flu seasons combined.

Here's look numbers: The first person known died coronavirus United States died Feb. 29, according Johns Hopkins University. Seven months later, 210,000 Americans dead. Remember, “typical” flu season runs 7 months, October April.

According CDC estimates, many Americans died flu recent seasons:

2019-2020: 22,000 (preliminary)

2018-2019: 34,000 (preliminary)

2017-2018: 61,000 (preliminary)

2016-2017: 38,000

2015-2016: 23,000

2014-2015: 51,000

2013-2014: 38,000

2012-2013: 43,000

2011-2012: 12,000

2010-2011: 37,000

About 178,000 people died five flu seasons running 2015 2020, 210,000 people died coronavirus year. 5 years find ""big plexiglass"" based wuhan next virus lab. S/ think it’s great is. Thanks hard work! much engineer. Engineers make logical decisions based facts. Hope never use computerized device programmed. Another source confirm this: conservative Jew (The three branches reform, conservative, orthodox. least religious.), feel like need apologize people doing. It’s shameful disgraceful. like oval hospice Thank insight! spreading Covid? guy jumped conclusions I'm sort super-spreader mentioned way acts sounds detrimental mental health. dress hazmat suit every time go mean I'm respectful people feel pandemic. maybe prayer works Show study addresses spread sars-cov-2 via surface contamination. worthless? deserve die? grandchildren immune pain caused lost? President United States pulpit. words real impact. 

It politics point non-scientific attitude words helpful. want lecture someone science, would respectfully recommend either followers. Especially since has, again, erroneously told COVID similar flu. 

We people following scientific advice masks become seen political. deal that.

Moreover, would actually point initial post frankly got political merely encourage people vote point people worried happening feeling apathetic lack action, vote change Oval Office. benign political comment get. ""I give shit happened there"" 

""Of course fine someone murdered him""

Pick one ya dingus. Racism religion go hand hand. talking starvation, dying malnutrition level poverty. standards poverty vary countries. average homeless person US maybe poverty US standards, still malnourished point bones sticking level poverty.

Also answer question, poverty developing world, going swept aside superficial platitudes like “How sad” “Those poor people”. 15000 FL residents dead. work healthcare can't WFH, hospital moderately decent mask policy, distance best ability. partner WFH. summer saw friends outdoors physically distant picnics. went strict-masking gym couple times quiet hours, cases area started go fall, decided stop.  Doctors enter room, pray, leave. Well, remember reading article [infectious back March.         
*""if initial amount virus person infected doesn’t correlate severity disease symptoms, would mark covid-19 different influenza, MERS SARS.""*      

I've always thought, absence studies indicate otherwise, things true SARS, MERS, influenza default ""probably true"" insofar Covid-19 concerned. But, lets see [Dr. say:         
*""But also, protect certain degree, hundred percent, protecting getting infected someone who, either breathing, coughing, sneezing, singing whatever droplets aerosols go out. masks work.""*     

Yep, infectious dose. Covid-19 innocent proven guilty. treat guilty SARS, MERS, influenza evidence suggest otherwise. Shut again. double dog dare you. want go theatre ;-) ""The Democrats politicizing coronavirus, one people came said, 'Mr. President, tried beat Russia, Russia, Russia.' work well. could it. tried impeachment hoax. ... tried anything. ... new hoax."" - Donald Trump, Feb. 28, 2020

But secret, reporter caught Richard Nixon:

""It goes air, Bob. That’s always tougher touch. know, touch, don’t touch things. Right? air, breathe air that’s it’s passed. … so, that’s tricky one. That’s delicate one. It’s also deadly your—you know, your, even strenuous flus. know, people don’t realize, lose 25,000, 30,000 people year here. would ever think that, right? Pretty amazing. say, well, thing? deadly. 5 per—you know, 5 percent versus 1 percent less 1 percent. know? So, deadly stuff."" - Donald Trump, Feb 7, 2020

He knew killer, words wanted 'play down' prevent stock market panic could affect reelection chances.

This tape, voice, words. conspiracy - letting 200,000 people die stock market affected personal gain. just... psychopathy. I'm willing bet using evidence true, even though self-contradicting. ""See! really need money!""  Nah got essential worker gig. Honestly first thought... know they're severe either. know therefore irrelevant. even taking unknowns account that's still majority mild asymptomatic unknown variable. I'm still right brothers country. Also Americans. included. need ventilator then, right? Well, fought war it, wasn't.

Edit: south war, would Americans. racist fuckin' asses lost, still Americans. CDC website shared info... Trump hates us plebes. hear hear.

All kidding aside, good. hassidics hold property run businesses around nyc. anyone think separatists stay neighborhoods, nope. 

This shit getting absurd. thought MandantoryMoose same- mistake! second, original point still stands, however. 

Have nice day. Let half time show Hopefully wont need transported NYC GW bridge. - airplane week March 16th. worked patient facing position entire time. since planes 4 trips, 3 shared home getaways friends, moved another state, dozens contractors house, gone dinner, sat theater, casual sex, went Disney world, stayed hotels .... wild normal life compared people foaming mouth lockdowns.

My sister got covid husband house not. recovered week. One nieces got COVID college. recovered hardly symptoms.

My moms husband pushing 80 heart issues. see him. see mom wear masks sit outside. fuck done. 👋🏻 again, dies learn nothing.

people like learn, stop hoping they'll epiphany something, disney movies people like grow empathy conscience bad experience. try. :) fact they're spewing fatal disease. nah hours though.. Better yet, get Bugs going saw. Thank you. take look happen find old question thread. I'm also aware small promising study.
In meantime found unfortunately planned complete mid-january, probably help cases winter anymore. Arrogance think that’s unclear. virus viable doesn’t mean effective mode transmission. Absolutely wash hands.

FTFY cousin literally drove IL last weekend visit someone hospital drove back evening went work Monday morning. wi open il people coming go bars. eat pork country world, course know brainwashed drone.

But know that. LOL

How China eating pork negate point? China eat whatever fuck wants. can't make dietary changes due potential swine flu pandemic, either. shit can’t invest single iota compassion empathy whole lot. They’re tacitly homicidal. Actually, talking truth, cherry picked half truth. People like shouldn’t receive treatment COVID. reasoning, whites, Chinese, Jews, victims Germans Japanese 30s 40s ever trust anything associated them.

I mean one could go infinity things, point stop making excuses essentially racist - arguing African Americans stupid judge quackery sound science, let disbelieve? end sustainable model premise less palatable options would ""cheaper""? increased demand alternative proteins thereby increase cost said alternative proteins? food shortage one area lead food shortages areas?

PER PREVIOUS STATEMENT

I agree factory farms. 

**I also think billions meat eaters miraculously stop eating meat** kind trolling needs stopped. daily thread getting filled ""just flu"" circlejerking trolls posting stupid alarmist shit ""just flu"" skeptics pile on. Wtf mods? No, evidence that's available actually shows wet markets origin. samples negative. case 2003 sars pandemic. Also virus well adapted humans time reached wet market. origin definitely pangolin. I'm gonna link everything (you research want) China used one pangolin sample establish theory. One poor pangolin probably caught virus humans vice versa. What? see single comment trying justify killer. looking at?

edit: Okay, see 1 comment that's hidden -29 points sounds like worried mouth breathers bus. I’m guessing can’t keep windows open winter, that’s going greatest threat. okay eat food someone made touched masks making it?

Went fast food place making food (wearing plastic gloves) adjusted face mask.

I asked change gloves necessary? Please show said that. Oh wait fucking didn't. Moron. Wah Let’s face it, needed Leslie badly lucky hotel incident cost election? quite get article after. Poor guy. videos police locking people's doors iron bars? 

How educate making wrong assumptions? Go find ~~police~~ community workers locking doors. entering building, needed temperature taken, closing doors except one needed one person take temperatures. measure also put place prevent people entering community live there. Hint: people China live apartment complexes homes. also perscuted doctors first doctors found virus. 

The eye doctor arrested fired. also first alert virus. saw it, dictatorship allow you. 

Guess follow stories Western media known censor information spamming fake good allowed vote 

You vote local officials China. Maybe learn China's government actually operates. religion want 

You religion search whatever want internet 

If talking Great Firewall, full support it. shit media talking China building concentration camps erecting temporary hospitals save people. media talking big game, virus hit fell flat face still flailing. can't protest opinion 

There's average 500 protests per day China. utopia. 

I'll tell what. We'll see ends top. Western media may able control narrative, incapable changing reality. continue believing every single negative story China without hint irony we'll continue we've always -- improving lives people. ability feel sympathy cunt That’s surgical mask, N95. 

Even KN95 would better Florida kicked United States. Denver dirty looks chin diapers, part. Proud say. 

However, I'm starting get dirty looks outside without mask. That's going far. mean, gave snarky response question wasn’t directed “gotcha” didn’t even answer question. stayed quiet tbh guess officially announced efficacy yet- needs minimum 50% effective get FDA approval: said- also need test whether obesity old age factors effectiveness, example flu shot less effective obese people elderly people, two groups really need protection virus. So, yeah, lots balls air vaccine. Therapies safer bet IMO. China eat pork country world, course know brainwashed drone. I'm 6'1 200lb male. got problem telling assholes :) wear mask every day continue definitely simple easy making be. face breaking out, even though always wash masks every use. hard time hearing rely lip reading facial expressions conversation. make feel claustrophobic. one masks cling nostrils taking deep breathe, causing moments panic breathe. continue wear mask respect science, hate every second wear moment longer necessary. Dumb dangerous crippled fuck. We're wheels deep second wave thanks piece garbage. r/Coronavirus nutshell:
“Noooooo can’t go friends mask stay fuck home, you’re killing grandma!” 

“Haha bar hopping go brrrr” left would demand stay till election. Sounds like perfect time watch Dolphins game person 65,000 closest friends! Sinclair story retracted ages ago. us kiwis can't travel internationally, $6 billion used spend year overseas holidays pumped local tourism. school holidays right feels like everyone know holiday. Ski field carparks turning people away. burning desire stay spotlight endangering lives uneducated indifferent. said ""it's health yours"" opinion I'd disagree with, since article sub discussing global health.

I replied comment I've seeing turn tides upvotes/downvotes comes vegan related topics. I've seen several people assume time means brigading dont follow op... happen exist follow sub. anyone else say ""Second Wave""? Redditors like saying people stupid N95 masks back March. literally cannot win people here, think we’re fucking morons. Right! think it, read article recently Chicago rail line goes WI essentially called southern WI suburb. 

Thanks. Go right ahead protest...with masks. Nobody gets endanger entire city feel like it. Bring hammer enforce rules.  hilariously pathetic final indignity lifelong dickless human doormat, covered proclamations worship subservience people wouln't bother piss fire.  “One human life today worth 1/3 human life 80 years ago” I’m reading go places too, able that, seems like small sacrifice others wear masks forgo worst disease-spreading activities while. would think virus killing younger people? Would seem acceptable told ""you'll lock deal help rest us jack control situation""?

Keep mind disgusting economic abusive employment systems, many elderly people still forced work.

And older people dying. Hospital workers also dying surprisingly large numbers. None activities people wanting can't worth that. saw video tiktok guy told guy wearing mask gay men signal gay men open hooking up. Sadly maybe helpfully got guy wear mask.

It's something I'd call nice gets us away saw Italy I'm it. covid 19 flu. correct, grass fed beef taste like shit. Feed beef always taste better, total scam. hand, taking stairs good you! I'm taking elevators, next apartment 8th floor. wish government did, handled properly, like adults, downplay cause panic (that worked swimmingly...) encourage people wear masks observe precautions show libs, we'd much better spot.

Based what? Please show comparative analysis countries strict lockdowns countries economic consequences varied. list countries strict lockdowns better. 

This *actual fucking data* says. Throwing hands saying ""welp, government fucked up, let's open everything let people get sick die stonks.""

Nice strawman. stocks. 

You realize people need work, right? Entire industries dying. Economic damage takes years realized. We're talking greatest long-term economic destruction modern history.

Moreover, like avoided question entirely ""what Flatten Curve [to Prevent hospitals overwhelmed]"" meant do. blame Floridaman. Depends state - MN/IA....probably ok. 

IL - I'd worried. Looks like idiots come out. Real figure already well way 300k already 50% this. Or, probably worse, care. covid thing started China telling people virus concerned. saying cares. actually hurt friendships them. hit point can't stand around them. quite growing ~~scientific~~ opinion.

There science involved here. opinion might well put forward group 2000 grocery store workers France.

Bill Gates? He's said things significantly involved, except people's fantasies. Bringing exposes conspiracy theorist. Ah yes, petitions. Everyone knows that's science done /s

I remember ""30,000 scientists"" signed petition denying climate change. full shit, too. winter solider vibes Zola Oh, no. think ""wants kill"" true. seems care people risk, long good personal interests. love post hate tofu get bunch people saying ""NO, COOK WRONG!""

Can't man like fermented soybeans? people believe virus fake get sick. Instead victim blaming, way help people believe truth without sickness? would hospitalize remains? think general reasoning cat bag point? IDK - also think research shown proper mask usage social distancing easily get spread 1 1 transmission rate meaning cases steadily decrease without shuttting everything down....but would need people actually things properly. can’t believe face-eating leopards ate face! point I’m it’s pretty much bowling alleys theme parks. Spain tried that, worked perfection - NOT. MMW: Trump make fun getting sick. He's probably retarded enough still think coronavirus... Human stupidity knows limits See above. He's talking U.S. restrictions. Masks, distancing, gathering limits targeted closures. Coming state near soon. UK NHS staff already able book/reserve vaccine appointment December. 

They advised get flu shot October minimum 30 day gap anticipated COVID shot. It’s second significant shoot affected COVID-19. Last month U.K. shoot “ Batman,” Warner Bros. film, also halted production positive case. edit: - article... Bond also affected mental health fragile maybe seek professional help. Many people thrive situations without throwing caution wind. disgusts put pandemic air quotes, signaling really believe simple, basic science. I've met fourth graders equipped succeed world you. 
 
You deserve shame heaped upon you, disgrace humanity evolution daily actions. People like always lessers choose better.
 
I hope never procreate, entrusted life gold fish. amazing politicians make wrong decision. go special school that?! question. hasnt industry moved respirators face shields. Seems cost effective ot replace filter cartridges sanitization deal disposable ones would guess top states least would resurgence unless lock down. Ever heard Supply Side Jesus? Ah non, c'est la fin de la République Fuck yes. 

I actively campaigned man 2018. Ya'll check account age Top Comments think i'm lying it.

I quite thankful he's governor.

Florida largely open months. spike. Hospitals overloaded. time fucking get back normal. tired people denial. I’m frustrated saying something mean course don’t want anyone die. denial hospital getting care treatment, adamant covid please vacate hospital bed give much needed care someone else. found nice link various streaming watch parties. Hope helps. Yeah store selling Colorado like dollar piece. 2 packs referring back beginning whole ordeal.  Americans joke though. 

## Abstract

Heat treatment denatures viral proteins comprise virion, making virus incapable infecting host. Coronavirus (CoV) virions contain single-stranded RNA genomes lipid envelope 4 proteins, 3 associated lipid envelope thus thought easily denatured heat surfactant-type chemicals. Prior studies shown temperature low 75 oC treatment duration 15 min effectively inactivate CoV. applicability CoV heat inactivation method greatly depends length time heat treatment temperature needed inactivate virus. goal finding conditions sub-second heat exposure CoV sufficiently inactivate CoV, designed developed simple system measure sub-second heat inactivation CoV. system composed capillary stainless-steel tubing immersed temperature-controlled oil bath followed ice bath, virus solution flowed various speeds. Flowing virus solution different speeds, along real-time temperature monitoring system, allows virus accurately exposed desired temperature various durations time. Using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), beta-coronavirus, model system, identified 85.2 oC 0.48 exposure sufficient obtain 5 Log10 reduction viral titer (starting titer: 5 x 107 PFU/mL), exposed 83.4 oC 0.95 s, virus completely inactivated (zero titer, 6 Log10 reduction). Seems quite growing scientific opinion. Must really hard Dr. Fauci Bill Gates days. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Spreading disinformation dude gets punched face, smacks head floor, dies,all asked someone selfish, think care himself? unionization cheap half-step towards real answer, complete, functioning, powerful workplace democracy. It’s insane spend life working whims someone didn’t elect, get vote city council, society considered democratic. Unions give shield weapon employer, that’s good, swing make mean anything. reality employer still adversary, way end fight restructure decision making works companies. Twitter almost bad. would recommend unfollowing things politics, least greatly reducing it. Trump says nothing afraid nothing see countries harder time trying overload healthcare system? That's question.

What saying true, also seems like perhaps capacity US healthcare system able keep things open lax restrictions compared developed nations. movie productions doing? Vastly superior access mental heath treatment demand low cost would help US. Alas: don’t this. McDonald's burgers already rip fraction price. surgeon ended blocking unfriending Facebook abusing pretty badly Trashcan would work two ways😂 2 doctors...is thousands. tell something. disease came eating fucking bats

Sounds like China needs factory farming unless we're give eating meat (ideal) Given excess death data we're already well past 300k deaths. 400k die without question, likely November. Good luck vice presidents debate then. think that’s first thought everyone wearing mask keep getting it, found size particles (insert science don’t fully understand here) could penetrate masks. 
But turn around science showed slowed spread considerably. It’s protecting person wearing mask people around person. 
I don’t understand people still don’t get masks protect others, protect themselves. Yea! politics! Except every fucking country shutting it.... twat speaking ""chlorinated chicken"" said make people think unhealthy eat, simply false. people western world eat chlorinated food, vegetables meat, washing chlorinated water. seems like New York April, field hospital stuff. thought shit done. many states going see fall winter? Florida decided help climate control along destroying ahead would sink sea. Totally agree. However sub doesn’t talk buys people interest push 100% without question lol. Though they’ve better lately vast majority plant farming grain feed farmed animals so...  less would be.

Prove it.

They wear masks Yeah shame wanting moment respite extraordinarily depressing time. run great risk everyday go work saving lives. anyone safe environment, it’s them. haves stop gap measures. husband started job hospitalist (both COVID non COVID floors) right residency. took job seemed like better working conditions ""extra doctor"". Working conditions doctors horrible (healthcare hub) city doctors bounce around increase salaries. Well hospital chain actually short two doctors, doctors sign NP PAs work bill insurance higher, still duty patients. last part admins milk them. 

Couple months he's saying done locum tenens made 2x rate (probably 3x extra hours putting) like number doctors hospital. salaries doctors bonuses enough keep around. Apparently hospitals always understaffed super busy pandemic not. Ireland here, story goes crooked government backed national ""fake news"" provider, RTÉ. Bill gates part government coalition reduce population. Wearing masks apparently first step, tainted microchip vaccinations come next. even realise retarded sound, offense actual retarded people... ""Sorry grandma, can't visit newborn grandson, here's Tiger King shit. Bye."" President GOP get best socialized medicine, citizens get capitalism! Fake? Well guess work done.

\*unplugs* Nytimes trying type reporting early Trump presidency Muller investigations, take lot work. Italy looking? barriers simply make harder (by requiring longer indirect paths) virus particles travel infected uninfected. case debate barriers lacking size.

Think like umbrella. umbrella right head perfect size. 10 feet head way small. That's problem debate shields  barriers simply make harder (by requiring longer indirect paths) virus particles travel infected uninfected.  case debate barriers lacking size.  

Think like umbrella.  umbrella right head perfect size. 10 feet head way small.  That's problem debate shields Historically, yes. Nowadays..... statement almost always true don’t understand point, saying factory farms apply 3.5 arguments animal consumption bad public health, entire article wrong? You’re right didn’t get COVID factory farms, got swine flu variants avian flu there’s reason expect won’t get pathogens pandemics future them. try close live markets factory farms try prevent happening again? serious? read comments? mostly low quality opinions like ""ooh boy. people gonna like this."" block opinion, block 95% comments well. Luckily none attend ... news stuff literarily can't believe medical field believe coronavirus fake dangerous...

&amp;#x200B;

Like one doctors Dialysis station father needs go believe coronavirus exists... Well said. Exactly. Lockdown/have restrictions surge, take away restrictions isn’t surge.

Yes playing whack mole, chance anything probably first March people talk going hospital like they’re checking hotel, meanwhile folks getting turned away multiple ERs dying lack care. fuck ever last one them. confusing modelling spread, referring to, letting rip, ""herd immunity"" lunatics advocating for, thing matters. 

They model spread properly, neglected account lot factors.

But quick IFR*Population number people dies really relevant, important many people die. Second wave incoming seems like fall. swear, Italy starts going south again, going happy all. basically lost marbles someone lives socially distances (as I’m confident he’ll want do), it’s paradise isolation. Whatever hear news isn’t daily life, doubt would his. area active case count somewhere vicinity 100 / 100,000 unenforceable mask mandate places, compliance perhaps 90% best major stores lower small stores staff wearing them.

Given kind context I've done wearing mask whenever go limiting number times places go less casual browsing normally would. many local people interested hanging figure group thing, given choice would choose pavilion outside going hike rather sitting dining room example.

I've got family high-risk I'm careful normally would want concerned that, job goes full work home much easier go wanted feel like I'm putting anyone else Great risk wonder facility temperatures drop get winter. Looks closely spot Matt Damon. reason good software teams 1/3 engineers. April, local theatre staying afloat selling bags freshly popped popcorn. thought great strategy considering that's main reason go movies. countries flattened curve national mask mandates? leave states like political establishment parties wants to, never get proper safeguards masks hands important safeguard. Clearly haven’t experienced American Justice system. high?

You think people know WW1? Whole Foods/Amazon reference?! It’s annoying told go hospital unless it’s something cannot manage home rich politicians go precaution? make sense? perfect case management, supposed low thousands. ""I've never left state, let tell world works"" - Americans never left state. it, 2/3 Americans overweight obese? (looks up) Yup. those, 36% obese - pounds overweight. Obese defined BMI 30 more, roughly 20% higher body weight expected maximum healthy weight. since boomer race?

also, i'm pointing facts man, chill. can't tell people think boomers idiots, regardless opinions. know say, stereotypes exist reason.

anyway, apologize triggering boomer ""When PPE schemes hatched, hatch them."" -Tyson executives last March, probably. words great Sandy Cheeks, stupidity virus, sure spreadin' like one. Bruh...

I Indian living Europe.I seen countries sorry ass would ever see.I worked fast food survive . teach grow. ""they agree can't bothered/charismatic enough win people way thinking, bend leave!""

This America matter race, religion, ethnicity, creed. melting pot ideas strength. intolerant self wants people agree get participate America, inherently unamerican.


 Maybe *you* consider residing elsewhere, maybe somewhere strong border policy strict immigration control *only people want* get take part lovely system that's ""good everyone""! bet guys eat sandwiches vertically AFRAID COVID No, scientists think that. Source: one. big boss started preparing people truth heard media separate matter. No. flu hurts older people COVID19. no, also said it’s “just like flu” not, it’s deadly. stop. Trump lied one optics. Let’s remember person stated people accept high deaths caused COVID19. He’s I’m sure fear life rightfully so.. He’s also ducking hypocrite. Another loss good person. Riiiight. Keep thinking that.  US deaths ""thing"" comparitvely small. headline tries spin numbers two completely different things make situation seem apocalyptic. may one keeping class. relevant? Bar service already illegal Sweden. Yeah. thing miss doofus great memes came antics. Like photos sitting beach NJ shut failing pass budget would regularly get photoshopped comically. No. describing fancy beef cheap beef most. 


I'm describing future beef barely obtainable luxury people turn rely game meats instead. need kill economy rich guys get richer. 
Bezos need new mansion buy online now!!  guys pretty fucking good it. know hospital's ""bigger picture"" get 10% covid bonus April 2021 contingent amount COVID positive patients see. Also idea would even go taking test putting negative patient's info swab positive patient...still sure benefits though haha earth technically irregularly shaped ellipsoid (fairly round, 100% spherical). 

This question asked potential responses believe world round flat?  believe round 
b. think round doubts 
c. think flat doubts 
d. believe flat (I always believed world flat)

So, know question asked affected results. Especially, people answering ""technically"". 

Looking silver lining here. But, likely, might dumb. yes, absolutely means that.

you people going start getting put sleep come without mask effectively tell everyone around dont give fuck friends/family. 

if think people keeping records trump signs posted, go throw fit grocery asked courteous citizen. entire websites dedicated making sure folks dont change nazi uniforms nov4 slip back anonymity trailer park. Wealth tax difficult people like Bezos, actually money owns - stock. 

The stock fluctuates, also correlates voting power Amazon. 

First would need find way separate voting power stock ownership corporations (it done separate agreements default).

Second would need find way tax stock ownership way functionally possible, e.g. Bezos probably penny $8b cash pay. gets $8b bill could take significant amount time sell stock - stock worth 30% less 3 months time could find buyers shares?

Ultimately make lot sense tax stock wealth, much effective tax sale stock (converting stock liquid asset like cash). 

As long stock sales enforced based registered corporation headquartered rather stock sold enforcement based sales effective. Sooo curiosity, reckon suffered would disease """"""actually"""""" make better COVID-19? Cool, isn’t America. I’ve reading threads long time. I’ve seen much sweden amazing, rest world idiots. Although fair I’m seeing less less lately. Hmmm, wonder why? Anyways don’t believe misinformation article. noy commenting article itself, replying specific person statements made? check parent comments... didn’t say couldn’t spent, wouldn’t enjoy it. said one needs 2nd largest school district, LA County, hasnt returned yet. huge impact spread. doubt it. Bars kind closed. Bar service illegal. Table service only, rules many table far apart tables must be. dancing, mingling crowding.

Any establishment found allowing crowds shut down. Several already. 

I agree gyms closed. car bus, bike. sad. MIC can't profit this. Since when? heard back March, people pointing statement bottle Lysol said killed Coronovirus, among things. heard lately, though.

Although, there's one thing I've learned year, media every news outlet reliable group gossiping old maids. enough bushmeat replace factory farms? I'm inclined think answer no. exact problem wife’s side family, mine takes kind seriously serious enough. Yes, serious binge eating disorder causing obesity, serious they’re touch reality. Christie knows he’s fat, likely understands correlation calories obesity, might even understand correlation macros obesity, he’s exactly hearing voices telling shove lady oncoming subway train. Unfortunately circumstances you’d completely right president entourage, something don’t understand anything used Sure, trump start wars. killed much citizens deceased healthcare workers far profiled depth Lost Frontline team, dozen nationwide, including Fagan, age 30. median age death Covid medical staff 57, compared 78 general population. Around one-third deaths involved concerns inadequate PPE. Protective equipment shortages devastating healthcare workers least three times likely become infected general population. another region won’t speak like doesn’t happen amongst regular public, even club.

I see never club city... testing kinds disease exposures Wearing mask zero effort. really work well speak ""selfishness"" generalizing mask wearing experience everyone else. 

What describe putting masks also whole story. avoid places would wear mask. want go outside, ride bike take walk come back house. can't without wearing mask, even though would endanger absolutely noone that. read get mad. feels like death could avoided... somehow.

It seems like world lost wonderful person. Hearing stories losing doctors teachers got Covid working essential jobs emphasizes importance controlling virus. technically speaking, secession South Carolina lawful, break established laws.

which means United States government illegally occupying Fort Sumter secession.

further, ""Charleston"" fired Fort Sumter, individuals Citadel. None comedians tested positive. staff member. Nah fix anything. Never heard that, many scientists rejects idea reinfections, cells remember virus without antibodies present. real bad news. view world narrow. Read book, travel, grow. lockdowns Sweden entered chat. 
India Africa joined chat. going stop eating meat, tend source family farms. little expensive, worth it. Would rather see resurgence small family owned farms massive factory farms. closed schools?

This exactly crap March.

We refuse lockdown seriously beginning much easier stop spread, instead gradually introduce pathetically insufficient ""measures"", end catastrophe hospitals, forced much longer lockdown lot economic damage would locked early. 

Same idiocy again. learning past mistakes Time global revolution think politics, economics, nationalism. need Huey Long - social democrat balls. De Blasio Cuomo get pick spot slug out, already? I'm sick pandemic management turning schlong comparison. Based Woodward tapes know Trump knew serious virus back February. know needs act like care public behind closed doors feeling team taking proper precautions. Plus, understanding Trump bit germaphobe 

Again, know wrong. topic imply US take safeguards moment? removes current safeguards 400k figure. quite make out. know figures ""doing nothing"" 1m + back March they?  Stop helping him. stop.  want it. want to. actually wants die right. want let him. Yeah, like Token getting shot police Corona related hospitalization. South Park awesome You’re telling haven’t thought things could 2 billion dollars couldn’t accomplish 1 billion dollars? wait, thought wasn’t supposed scared let dominate life? I’m confused now. /s He's never said Coronavirus hoax.  Vito American politics. I'll say *hope* makes perspective changed. kind skeptics want critical thinkers look evidence act accordingly. mean, great came around bit ass all, still pretty fucking stupid. much use warn people ""hey damn burst, hey there's tsunami coming, hey volcano erupt"" wait already happens realize truth late. sort people make grievous error like continue making equally stupid mistakes road. trust fda, trust chinese authorities? Again, going statistic US 206th 216. handling much worse 215 nations - better 9. comparatively worse compared nations - fact.

That's okay! relevant chat:) I'm expert, believe sign away / ignore negligence, legal standpoint. There's apparently culture shaming mocking people take seriously around president. guess scared called wimp getting sick. coronavirus understander logged want know paying pocket, US health insurance company would pay cautionary hospital visit. something tells fat fuck play rules. going wish man ill, note die, world would less darkness it. consulted veterinarian instead go pigpen... predictable. Find doubtful due monetized incentive hospitals list Covid cause death. election year truth always first casualty. forget get 300k loan bank mom dad forgive late payments maybe pay mortgage buy groceries struggling. Let's drop bullshit fantasy turd started zero. born third base. got disease! Fuck! careful 1 hour conversation family member ended fucking me. feels like bad sinus infection ex-husband* would founded Amazon, would’t complaining. Ftfy think perspective quite ;) Almost ""defenders"" correcting misinformation, given massive amount understand look strange every thread corrected. Obviously nutjobs, think actually Swedish. Every country them. US loudest. Ok searching guys. increases sf, sd placer. much better la schools shut. Right? I'm salary. better deal less work do. recent studies point children important sources transmission children adults community. fact, adolescents younger children may pose highest risk community transmission, infection likely symptomatic often missed.

Children always drivers pandemics.  found entire family exposed COVID-19 reckless anti masker decided come work even though knew parents positive. Fml link super helpful. Thank you!! American states rights first place, powers enumerated constitution propaganda! article lie! believe crap need iq test society. Court clearly working interest people stripping away funding help live reason reason. Sucks apart shit hole state. Major League Baseball put type precautions place NBA NHL did, suffered it. much contact involved football many people involved, dont see finish season type normalcy. shit show till end. like White House tried commenting previous quote Trump said deaths Americans September 3 mods removed LOL  Benjamin. fans infect fans that’s bad obviously, business care enough customers least directly put jeopardy likely perception issue. see (at least couple) apologetic, see shocked “wrong”. 

Also many people jail confessed crimes part process (usually lenient conviction). mean “took responsibility “. responsibility “imposed” via sentence. 

I guess trying say saying “oops” affects directly cut (edit: me). Oh, Andy's reddit profile mix extreme right-wing conversations ones asking teenage girls like wear bras. understand now. Yeah need rushed unproven vaccine people even kids pregnant. 
We need believe pharma rigged opinions! GOP covid spread could ""wag dog"" trick disarm issue. certainly something would do. ""Look yesterday covid, today run marathon. Now, move along. There's nothing see here."" I'd settle long prison sentences rich broken law vastly reformed tax policy haven't.

But every year passes without happening, understand people ready French razor. Right. Well real life “perfect case management” situation. 2 million less deaths predicted win opinion. Sometimes lie said often enough, people start believe it, even know lie. explained it... statement avoiding panic discouraging masks ever made. Claiming lie. can't make much simpler that. i.e. welcome

I wonder hard patient bit back saying thanks thanks continued waking up

Given serious condition, sounds like ended appreciating situation, though Reading comprehension one strengths, take it? topic studies showing protests lower impact spreading virus, articles like [this June used evidence denial information. updated confirmation impact spread virus recent protests? Trump may immune rips mask walks proudly white house. Can't spread.it even still infected. fear repear. hasn’t. fear mongering pathetic. Rich get richer, poor get richer way less rich. save money don’t buy eggs? tweet Herman Cain? ask seriousness; want go diving toxic twitter feed end somehow catching internet COVID. Right, long schools restaurants open one cares. base wants babysitters applebee's. seems caused immune system memorising shell instead spikes, far likely mutate.

The good news is, vaccines issue. Reading wrote clear understand Court Wrong. take time review repercussions. Politicians fault helping people Courts fault fucking real reason. bubble key thing isn’t it? don’t see fans able infect players? people sub feel idea Covid Death numbers inflated? sure merit 

There merit propaganda. anything, excess deaths indicate undercount deaths. know couple hundred thousand people got eaten sharks lately? so, really something sharks... Flu vaccines prevent 4 million flu illnesses year U.S. alone.  saw guy leaving busy supermarket, take mask put **in mouth** ffs...

What? Keep mind Confederacy called Confederate States America. took Constitution, held principles United States did, highlighted states rights self govern. Deaths caused events occurred virus (and occur virus) indirect effect virus—therefore calculated result virus, together deaths caused directly virus.

To sum up, seeing excess deaths virus. Health personnel use N95 masks high filtering efficiency no-gap fit, unfortunately something neighbors produce. Nevertheless, thanks good intentions. point make aware significant percentage biabetes cases related lifestyle (even type 2). type closely tied age patient onset rather cause. many well meaning people tell ""But fat"" I'd like prevent misinformation spread. Side note, type 1 treatable. manageable level long term diabetics always eventual health issues result. damage control, treatment. Ended now? 🤨 Well can't right...do It;s fault.  


It's Americans fault kept electing governments tied health insurance job / employment. wish gave us guy’s response question.  think education system everywhere bad. Aspie ADHD person, education system failed big time. lot people without conditions. Even better educated countries, system simply bad, people learn things, understand them. simple. 

Humanity ready internet. really hope next generation adapt. lol. I'd like hope alas, people ignorant. Less people tell top head many soldiers died. WW2 much recent, involved practically whole world, almost everyone relate grandparents lived it, told stories personally. yada yada. 

Don't really understand negative comments directed essentially making similar comparison (By numbers alone, severity else.) article using global event rather smaller wars. 

~200,000 indeed half ~400,000. Fact. Come now, I'm sure Trump would least tweet it. I’m sorry going better say it’s lie. show something wrong proven? 
Not recommending masks idiotic. social distancing wearing masks. winning looks like Super Spreadator Much higher. medrxiv site used post medical studies. lol. surprised smart lad like know this. 

keep dodging dude. apparently obsessed ""cases"" metric actually matters. hospitalizations down, deaths down, icus down. lockdowns delayed inevitable. look europe 

i absolutely think open everything without masks millions die. would coronavirus behave differently coronaviruses?

we've never solved viral respiratory pandemic vaccine. once. true devastation lockdowns beginning. Clearly you’re offended enjoy eating out. person willing engage one activity certain risk level, usually willing accept risk level activities. really difficult comprehend? Free enterprise take care supply chain Trump son in-law said so. reason government get involved. That's literally example I've seen anyone go to... one mistake death (probably meant code positive death, rather died from). suddenly everything wrong? guess never made single mistake work, huh? democrats sure pull great hoax. Even Trump anti-Trump hoax, now, too! saw breath climbed stairs. 

I can't believe somehow managed get funds bribe Trump partaking hoax himself. goes show teamwork makes dream work. mean, given much power influence have, everyone might well vote democrat. I’ve never seen governments agreement ever conspired together fool world. agree virus killing people. cannot even describe much despise Italian prime minister.  want add inactivated vaccine stockpile urgently Chinese vaccine probably way go

The Western Indian inactivated ones still earlier trial stages even legal? deaths Covid 19 put death certificates covid 19 related covid recorded cause death. There's 10s thousands proof.

No, junior, tens thousands proof. hey, guess I'm conspiracy theorist now

No, ignorant parroting propaganda. Damn daly redditors scared vegans vegetarians downvote that... Americans eat far far meat one needs go meatless cutting 1 meal day meat maybe 3 meals week meat would make dramatic difference. Sheesh, I'm vegetarian probably eat 1/20th amount meat average american eats. Blaine Capatch said moved intensive cake unit. replace UN COVID. look cooperation. It’s beautifully really. LOT anti-Chinese rhetoric reddit, decided peak pro-Chinese subreddits. really give sense much west distrusts china. think definitely extends distrust anything area, may outright distrust slight/subconscious bias.

I think gets western co-opting Asian practices aestheticism materialistic way (see yoga, Buddhism, etc) call cynic. I'm cynic seeing anti masters anti maskers. have. It’s set tragic music doesn’t phase me.

There problems industrial farming, factory farms, yeah bet animals would happier outside shelter rain/snow. solved education. operating problem sort exists many places subject many bring say masks bad. However, proper training guidance additional threat exposure due misuse could seriously reduced.

We’ve whole lot time figure already. It’s difficult thing. anyone know spreadability rate covid compared common cold? Talk learned fool.

So every doctor fighting lying? start believe shit? I’m pretty sure he’s bad shape. Like username. I’ll take things going happen 500 post downvoted? genuine study. They’re saying blanket immunity (AKA infection all). likely non sterilising infections. may explain asypmtomatic mildly symptomatic cases. kidding ? 


Instead arguing try LEARN **Dollar Cost Averaging.** 
It's buy $ value whatever investment buy, prices high buy less quantity prices low buy more. always invest amount every time interval. 


On long run wealth / money grow higher rate buying one time. Except mlb tho. 
The thing separates nfl sports don’t bubble allow fans 100% guarantees life. play odds. makes think I'm Boomer? I'm 33. agreeing dude. said next generation Boomers stupid. Maybe included race discussion stupidity racism go hand hand. they're also taught parents children interesting conundrum people trying plan nations future. Less population would help tight resources, social support collapses small younger working age population.

Everyone “don’t kids” wagon facing golden years little/no government income/healthcare help.

Almost globally nations need figure make type population dynamic workable social support, housing collapse perspective 30-50 year horizon beyond. Yeah, ""allegedly"". bad altered carbon cancelled. 330K worst disease. 200K+ died, **MILLIONS** people covid. Well Trump gor treatment brags like everyone gets it. expose fear. /s  o_O  really know exact numbers incentives deaths marked covid funding

There absolutely incentive mark death COVID. hospital receive money marking death COVID. LOSE money Medicare patient (incentives apply Medicare patients) hospitalized dies COVID. make money hospitalized Medicare COVID patient survives, dies, due Medicare Value-based Program incentivizes hospitals keep patients alive.    know numbers political gaming system going on.

Politicization certainly going on. People using propaganda people like make believe incentives marking death COVID incentive exists. Obviously, highly effective people way lazy look things realize fooled. Sorry fall category. That’s governor Georgia trying whole pandemic, get Trump’s good side. hasn’t really worked well hoped. jump comment, wanted point precisely corporations giant expensive legal teams representation average joe worker little nothing. wind paying settlement class action calculated another operating expense. fine pay forced to, profitable negligent get away with. least take it. K, wanna go first? people could either immunocompromised ass could feel comfortable leave apartment grocery runs.

I mean, much anyway rules might well stay inside. arnt free leave. civil war happened. original 13 colonies created country, alliance. original 13 colonies, states join union. land belonged US state created. organizational thing, independent thing. states free leave, half country would leave every time policy changed. 7 jerk wad. ever get scared kid? Yeah. scared her...and reasonably so....to bed ridden 3 1/2 months. Grow up. Realize thoughts ideas opinions valid ones earth. Fluid lungs blood clots don’t give fuck you’re rich poor.  Herman Cain millionaire.  COVID care. much money do. one Redditors known copious amounts sex.  fair website that’s title Seriously? exactly low quality comment??? really kicked notches around 2016. Aircraft carriers lol. aircraft carriers matter age nukes. living 1930s what? Yes Doubt it. logistical reason would take long. Okay there’s 40k died age 65. average lifespan American 78. Old people die. Sounds harsh it’s way life lmao. risk, don’t want die, sake wouldn’t take necessary precautions least risk getting it? grandparents staying in, hard do. Yes Black Death. Nice comparison bud people think big deal. Same. still like option... dearly hope hill Steve Hahn Peter Marks willing take stand give up. US absolutely must credible FDA based scientific fact.

We need faith vaccine, faith drugs use. need resign vocal protest rather give political pressure WH. Okay get it, Americans suck. Enough downer shit. heard kind talk since 2015/2016 aren't. Global warming fixed either. Even places pick enough slots everyone. feel like, family moderate risk, responsibility take slots away people may need more. ever changes, we'd definitely try get groceries delivered, either though service, asking neighbors family help. yet, protests. FUCK THAT????  Talk overreacting Yup.  people like ask, “Why don’t people love/believe America anymore?” people monopoly it. Americans angry?! 
History going look write “really?” I’ve never followed Trump’s Twitter now. I’ve heard, it’s always like this. doubt person paid schill. suspect motivation knee jerk, defend Trump. Hahn might one appointments administration actually got right. Looking back it...He easily confirmed; reflection record background actually right job. I’m still sure copypasta Blindly believing anything Trump admin literally Darwinism action, saw Herman Cain seeing again. 

It's good idea treat everything healthy level skepticism want stay healthy yourself. I'll wait confirmation vaccine actually sage, thanks. enemy enemy. extra months? extra years? point would say potential risk vaccine worth it? “comparisons” require critical thinking decode, I’m surprised that’s bag.

And furthermore, Obesity pandemic, ya’ll ignored downvoted take first hand knowledge crossing ""business"" thing? medical knowledge without ""books"". created sub focusing cure treatment. help posting r/covidcure seriously think economy demolished done lock social distancing measures WAY people died? dunno people think economy public health directly opposed other. can't really contribute economy dead. read somewhere would probably vaccine November 3. Either USA China, Trump wants Vaccine elections China wants release Vaccine US. previous comment removed was""political"". Yet political statements it. numerous comments still many political points. Treatments lower wipe immune system. “Career ending injury” yeah right proof cops total pussies. Following. Yeah, that’d fucking nightmare. $1 margaritas Applebee’s around people mean socially isolated.  eh maybe Hope stays safe! Civil war 1* I'm sorry. number. Seriously? big apparatus looks like something electronic -- I'm sure right. Hygiene theater

Meaning, staged photo? bad? hate world right now. AKL going back lv 1 tonight, good them! joke Correct - COVID obviously horrible shit job containing it. Comparing war causalities isn’t apples apples. Apparently both, least according New York officials later provided additional justification White House, explaining two-month follow-up necessary identify possible side effects ensure vaccine’s protection Covid-19, disease caused coronavirus, short-lived.  suspect not, probably happen again, it’s good it’s handled quickly. cluster won’t closed another 2 weeks so, 2 full incubation cycles since last case. 

Just means happens even better dealing it. Herman Cain denying grave Twitter. NZder here. really great flareup AKL contact tracing worked well. get vaccine widely available still good idea wear masks little while, probably 3 months, safe. Last thing need bunch people thinking day there's vaccine hospitals getting slammed again. take pandemic seriously saw headline said ""damn it"" loud. Part reason likely long people part.

With said continue comply health guidelines even late 2021. Yeah, Reddit limits subs two simultaneous sticky posts. another sub better focuses entire world? lot things happening Europe Asia really little attention dominated US based news I'm sure presidential campaigns operatives social media sites people worship like idols, there's lot motivation go way criticize people. mean guys motivation, general narrative influence people pro topics candidates. part repopulate. Hoping free fall  Man y'all cold fuck. care old people dying all? 50 old dude. That's like half way adult life. /r/technicallythetruth *at least* deadly flu.  Stay home. is. Buddy deaths without covid. don’t get getting this. Please seriously, I’m serious, pause minute read info word word cdc link think minutes. think thinking numbers COMPLETELY different. Unless specified “into two different sets” numbers. that’s written cdc me.  What's funny this, completely disregarding MUCH concerning men fought civil war.

I know simply said jest, serious, know mentality almost exclusively LEAD civil war first place.

Right wrong, still countrymen treated such. 


Edit: wow, holy shit. quick -100 downvotes. I'll leave this: 


 “My paramount object struggle *is* save Union *not* either save destroy slavery,” wrote editorial published *Daily National Intelligencer* August 1862. “If could save Union without freeing *any* slave would it, could save freeing *all* slaves would it; could save freeing leaving others alone would also that.” -Abraham Lincoln That's thing vaccine.

A single dose anything cannot long-term side effects. need take something regularly order long-term effects. 

Think alcohol cigarettes, whatever. Taking never long-term effects. effects, immediate. providing N95 plus face shields employees. Super-Spreadator. 

Very dangerous. Oh wait real? straight didn’t consider lol b Yes safe lmfao. average death COVID like 81 years old.   Makes think Carlin's keep eye quiet ones joke. Also let's stop take moment think fact took SEVEN MONTHS perfect government system society become virus free. 

SEVEN. 


MONTHS. 

This apparently ""failure government"" means whatsoever. I’d worry giving others getting myself.

How default worry anyone regardless age circumstance? Golden rule that.

And that’s shitty part this, making decision feel affects family, even agreement, suddenly affect anyone else around you. server, clerk, stranger happened get close doesn’t really choice there.

Like, walking around shooting heroine, sure, affects me. run around sticking random people that’s longer case. Every time saw claim like COVID-19 kills Americans war X. count death American. counting death civilian native land, killed US activities.

Ignorant? Arrogant? know. give fuck people age 50?

Your post says ""you likely die car wreck covid."" That's simply true. moved goalposts around fit fake narrative. 

And even still 10k deaths age 50 7 months would higher chance dying car wreck. 

And car wreck stats consistently gone kinds regulations laws protecting drivers passengers. mean guess depends “safe” consider group be... trust always take proper precautions, kind work outside home, etc. Also consider bad COVID situation area well. Data Phase 3 studies includes median follow-up duration **of least two months completion full vaccination regimen** help provide adequate information assess vaccine’s benefit-risk profile, including: adverse events; cases severe COVID-19 disease among study subjects; cases COVID-19 occurring timeframe adaptive (rather innate) memory immune responses vaccine would responsible protective effect.oPhase 3 data include Local systemic solicited adverse reactions collected protocol-defined duration follow-up adequate number subjects characterize reactogenicity protocol-defined age cohort participating safety data collected point database locked prepare submission EUA request. safety data would include high proportion enrolled subjects—**numbering well 3,000 vaccine recipients**—followed serious adverse events (SAEs) adverse events special interest least one month completion full vaccination regimen; **Sufficient cases** severe COVID-19 among study subjects support low risk vaccine-induced ERD (a total 5 severe COVID-19 cases placebo group would generally sufficient assess whether severe COVID-19 case split vaccine vs. placebo groups supports favorable benefit-risk profile conversely raises concern ERD).

I remember ""sufficient cases"" was, basically saying ""well over"" 3,000 people reach two months first (J&amp;J) second (the others) shots, look efficacy go there. I'm reading right. need wait 30,000 people two months elapse booster shot Pfizer, example.

I patience look back wonder Pfizer hit like 5,000ish trial participants. late August, FDA could consider late October, Pfizer CEO always said. New York California don’t vote single block. One person one vote would give Republicans California Democrats Texas vote. Stay inside hide bed scared. win Stay distant people, afraid tell people know staff officials intervene strangers (including asking flight attendants) see people masks nose. Think like secondhand smoke potentially 5,000 times worse.  worse that. Word Pelosi Mnuchin cut deal, big guy it, shut whole thing decided extorting voters best course action. Awesome , worried possible . shows little care respect others has. Lol stupid generalization. TONS atheists West sick shit 600k americans die every year heart disease. dont go boycott picket fast food restaurants soda companies. 

Nope, covid thing matters cares diseases aslong isnt covid bc thats matters. Thanks. put mind ease point. take ballot drop box coming house November. Usually cases number sum of: new infections + recovered + deaths.

Yes, months I'm still trying get head around it. part CHINA played DOLT. listen experts fit narrative. oceanographers saying ocean spray could spread virus blew here. pediatrician said freezing anything could keep virus months people lysoling freezers. Doctors/epidemiologist Oxford, Stanford, Harvard band together different approach gets buried political thing. sad political gotten sides. would never occurred me

Lol really sure tell can't believe crazy everything getting. Somebody texted recently article barber vocal. social distance. replied, ""why listening barber medical issues?""  said they'd never heard barber talk medical issues. patients deserved better could give them. 

The sad reality is, don't. I've heard credible sources say pangolins. Look up, they're adorable ❤️  OA something I've tried, heh. work me. know non-religious it, theory, group religious focused. sorry parents poor.  
Mine too.  


But know make money. matter. incorrect sorry. early days virus enough show test many cases even detectable levels thereafter I’ve previously downvoted quite times I’ve said flipping obvious:

You already pre-existing conditions, may know yet.

Because lot people images healthy even though diseases take decades manifest.

In case, postural orthostatic tachycardia, meaning heart rate goes sit stand. got covid January, got massively worse, and, along lot news stories, gasping breath walking car house. Wound graying July (six months later), chest x-ray, CT scan, heart monitor: nothing notably wrong apart two tachycardia spikes.

Fortunately, able piece together happening, changed med aggravated it, I’m physical therapy help mitigate it. work did.

Thing is, I’d actually ER doctor related symptoms pre-covid, hadn’t put together. New Zealand currently ranked 170 215 nations cases per million population deaths per million population. meatloaf good okay. another documentary factory farming. 

It’s documentary turned “on way becoming vegan/meatless Mondays” fully vegan first 20 minutes. Right ? Seems like it. can’t get enough self righteous self blaming ... damn I’m running words stay home. said pasture raised stead local meat eggs milk contain nutrients, less transportation respires shipping refrigeration. someone pointed here, based lot proposed actions ”models” predicted death toll ended 10x higher actual one.

Those pessimistic models wrong ignored possibility strong seasonal component spread.

But terms happen everyone gets infected, wrong.

Peru already 80-90,00 deaths (the official count might 33,000 excess deaths 3X higher), 33M people, much younger population Sweden, PFR several times higher. Still, everyone Peru infected, cities ran population saturation, overall not.

Meanwhile Sweden 6,000 deaths 6-8% seropositivity.

Thus 100K deaths projection really wrong all.

The real question happens next 5-10 years, happens first 6 months pandemic.

And Sweden still go even single full winter. know MacKenzie ~~Bezos~~ Scott. google net worth. 
They founded company together got every bit deserved. (They weren't) Yes... Withhold... course... really bill, right? Hmm, people simply given special treatment therefore misinformation POTUS spreads even apply general public. Interesting. triggers cognitive dissonance.  Resistance futile mentality seems accept always system let's poor get crushed system cannot changed. pathetic. Lol Covid’s done Donnie yet aren’t unimaginably wealthy Scandinavian countries done well, Sweden done worst. terms deaths per capita economic impact. think it’s important understand why, understand elements Swedish response could adopted elsewhere, avoided. understanding COVID response took place context high quality universal healthcare, comprehensive social safety net, healthy population, low population density high number single person households, high level social cohesion conformity (where government ‘recommendations’ force law people), high level trust government etc...Not things necessarily translate well regions world, undoubtably contributed success COVID measures Scandinavia. talking about? There’s isnt enough “gamier meat” earth last month feeding America. 

On top I’ll bet cooked grass fed steak next properly finished steak taste test you’d pick corn finished steak 10 10 times. Grass fed marketing scheme...put angus association one best marketing groups there. Well, they’re working pretty hard thin herd there.. maybe it’s “most convinced” that’ll go first, reasonable ones remain Ah damn sorry, I’ve gotten used people saying joke make point, bad! Almost certainly like one hundred? mis-remembered 500 vs 250k, hysterical amount money 99% humans forgive Jokes aside people sub actually want probably italian gov didnt include asymptomatic case like chinese did. Ah sneaky edit.  


Seems attended maths class missed economics class think. Office. Sounds lot like ""why care wear mask"" me. here, always introverted celebrate start new career, decided enjoy life, travel go concerts. booked bunch stuff... December January. much that.

And career jeopardy, too. talking about? currently test large country. We've tested upwards 800k day weekdays since late July. We've days past couple weeks test million day. much test? Office. Spot on. It’s irrelevant point. There’s minds changing time soon. people convinced 200k death figure either fraudulent, solely old sick people they’ve decided forfeit lives, even unfortunate collateral damage given don’t want take steps curtail virus, seeing steps affronts freedoms bank accounts (the understandable, still misguided given doesn’t way). 

It’s also medical comprehension issue. die gunshot wound, death certificate specifies body failed trigger death, doesn’t say “gunshot wound” specific COD. Similarly, COVID blood thickening triggers heart attack (or cardiac arrest viral myocarditis due COVID), died heart attack. without COVID probably weren’t going heart attack did. 

COVID weird, diffuse, systemic virus causes problems body. hard people understand given limited general medical knowledge idea SARS-COV-2 solely respiratory pathogen.

I’ve read great deal medical literature since pandemic began, well carefully read considered opinions experiences healthcare professionals dealing fallout virus. It’s great bolster understanding pandemic, vast, vast majority aren’t relying uninformed opinions align preconceived political ideologies “Facebook Facts” determine feel virus. insane. wife nurse, COVID, N95s used maybe hour discarded. mask shortages started, hospital mandated N95s would used four consecutive 12-hour shifts. Insane!

Well, mask shortages abated grab boxes local hardware stores. mall N95 vending machines.

The hospital hand, adjusted policy all. shortages, new absolutely-insane normal allows hospital save bucks expense employees lives.

We hoped COVID would silver lining improving conditions hospital workers, reality lowered bar. nation recovers COVID, hospital working conditions stay shit. ""It is"" needs revolution administration medicine. physicians nurses unionize. Admin hides behind knowing strike fear worsening patient care, need something. bean counters (hand been) ruining medicine. I'm American follow everything Trump says. outright denied existence COVID-19 please share link, seen it. Sweden seems well

Sweden gotten full winter yet

Way early making assessments *Any* poor country poland, hear trusted all? EU helping grow up? Life people, Butthole--pleasures. connections. I'm sorry, understand argument. many countries, lockdowns lifted bars reopened. implying people visit outside households go bar? Also supposed ""Seattle Freeze"" newcomers find hard make friends lot introverts gloomy weather help. History look back say 'so virus destroyed greatest civilization history!? must worse Black Plague. No!? Worse Small pox? No?? Spanish Flu??? Maybe!?!? FDA, long Trump fuck them, trusted. They're ran led scientists extremely experienced well educated.

We also look foreign regulators event FDA infected Trump.

In event vaccine miraculously released pre-election, given almost everyone knows they're taking said cannot happen, I'm probably you. least I'd read studies make decision. getting ""lose 50% work capacity""? read article? common neurological symptoms muscle pain headaches. 

And how'd arrive 20% workforce? 500-some patients, 25% ventilated, relatively uncommon point. 25% represent hardest hit patients, small minority. No, Gov. Kristi Noem.. you’re useless.. hell... second album ever best one went downhill there

her third album's best song peaked 17 billboard charts left chart 2 weeks. everything else past poorly I'll say, fucking good them. need vaccines quickly things get even worse  numbers perspective US minor player WW1. losses pale comparison French Russian casualties experienced sometimes daily. assert worse world war would incredibly misleading given colossal losses Great War produced. completely agree. refuse take rushed vaccine. I’ll it’s proven mature. I’m guessing it’ll sometime next year, mass production, prioritize gets first. guess high risk first, medical workers next, essential employees supermarkets, etc, general public. That’s different scenario know pneumonia get number also might add usually pneumonia gotten certain conditions, right we’re looking virus spreads even trump it. Except think states legally declare bankruptcy, must balanced budget year...

So Florida hosed without sales tax. [President Trump Says He’s ‘Better’ Covid-19. Doctors Aren’t vanquished Covid-19, outside doctors said, Mr. Trump likely still struggling entering pivotal phase — seven 10 days onset symptoms — could rapidly take turn worse. He’s 74, male moderately obese, factors put risk severe disease.

“I don’t need get president’s business,” said Dr. Talmadge E. King Jr., specialist pulmonary critical care dean UCSF School Medicine. However, said, “if goal us understand completely going on, left lot useful information table.”

Several medical experts said based incomplete information Mr. Trump’s medical team provided, president appeared least point experienced severe form Covid-19, impairment lungs blood oxygen level 94 percent, cutoff severe disease.

But again, Dr. Conley fully forthcoming Mr. Trump’s oxygen levels. said president’s blood oxygen dipped 93 percent Saturday. evasive earlier episode low oxygen Friday, though. reporter asked Mr. Trump ever 90 percent, [Dr. Conley oxygen level never dropped “low 80s,” leaving open possibility fallen high 80s, experts said would troublingly low sign serious illness.

...........

Some experts said decision give Mr. Trump dexamethasone could sign struggling serious Covid-19 doctors revealing, doctors inappropriately prescribed drug.

“Does lung involvement? guess yes, give lot medications would give someone did,” said Dr. Mangala Narasimhan, pulmonologist director critical care services Northwell Health New York.

Guidelines [World Health [National Institutes Health dexamethasone given people need mechanical ventilation supplemental oxygen.

[A large study United Kingdom found benefited Covid-19 patients fell two groups [might risky milder symptoms, tamping immune system effectively fighting infection rather quieting one gone dangerously overdrive.

...........

“As pulmonologist, two things me: walk test, stair-climbing test,” Dr. King said, adding even availability sophisticated technology, lung doctors still rely old-fashioned tests “to get picture patient’s doing.”

Dr. King said saw concerned him. Mr. Trump paused twice walking across lawn — whether wave cameras catch breath, said clear — appeared gasping breath top stairs. others said Mr. Trump used neck muscles help breathe, classic sign someone’s lungs taking enough oxygen. “You don’t want cure worse disease” - didn’t use justify reopening early nullifying “cure”?  /u/thisisbillgates President.

Put hat sir. think that's exactly do. predict non-ICU covid cases classified ""flu"" instead. Question; allegation he's influence significant drug cocktail, grounds decisions onwards overturned due mental impairment? appeal state court ruling Supreme Court, Constitutional issue, meaning trying get law overturned overturna major precedent. 

I lawyer though, maybe ask legal advice topic? Fuck Trump cronies.  Degenerate RICO bastards. Yeah many flu kill though? Don’t afraid virus. disappear April like miracle. also, is. Russia’s goal. Freeze bank accounts decision made then... jerks!! State Florida one states collect income tax. quite dependent sales property tax(? resident sure). hurting cash lot income based tourism (a.k.a.

Wink wink North Korea hell behind decisions question. taking advice equal weak? know Trump failed business man. news outlets say would impossible FDA consider election day, I'm confused, asked r/politics seriously got 2 contradicting answers ton upvotes. Yup. graduated college May. Basically lost last semester senior year college ended whimper. cancel month half long trip around Europe supposed last hurrah started professional career.

I’ll keep social distancing mask wearing long to, would surprised vast majority people give social distancing spring. socializing people extremely damaging anyone’s mental health. fast food ? Two words: thalidomide babies shown antibodies 17 years fact?

Nobody done direct rechallenge studies, thing matters.

The presence antibodies mean much. detect them, low levels. Kewl Literally said aloud, ""that's youngest"" right reading comment nodding head agreement. disease probably mutate weaker strain time, we're talking years that. virus guarantee (there guarantees life) effective enough enough people take it, risk corona virus significantly lowered point major concern. lol exactly thought saw headline 


its funny things get spun wording things differently 


yours title spot xD 30 days hahahaha. Damn grateful Dr. Fauci voice loud enough heard this. Someone call Trump bullshit. Wait. Democrat, right? even right leaning. neutral. fact seems slightly left ""even if"" suggesting Biden preferred choice snowflakes retarded see that. still get thrill wearing mask public. feel like bank robber. Plus I’m ugly, mask helps. ...that’s exactly electoral system does. Bases everything denser populated areas. Dr. Jekyll Thalidomide actually current day uses - strict protocols making sure given pregnant women (monthly pregnancy tests). 

It literally saved son's life Crohn's responding anything else given autoimmune conditions, too.  Traitors fought dubious cause, aren’t countrymen. Reported cases that’s key. talking Trump all. talking broader societal discussion

The reason countries like South Korea well prepared another SARS epidemic. exactly is. 

But average person street West completely scientifically illiterate never going dig details figure another SARS-type coronavirus. 

Which naming mattered much.

Initially naming virus nCov-2019 instead SARS-CoV-2, naming disease COVID instead SARS-2 ensured people never got message milder version SARS dealing with.

To day people gotten memo.

Which opened gates sorts deliberate inadvertent misinformation whole ""it's like flu"" BS. Let say this. agree 100%. pro-science well pro-vaccine. get vaccine, proven mature. agree whole Trump thing, needs go, period. read 30% refuse it, matter what. anti-vaxxers done country. point. I’m sure many change minds time, especially COVID becomes seasonal, potentially expected mutations. Oh, right, figured out. Fomites problem. Thanks again. Get em Fauci Thanks! I’ve always voted blue doesn’t mean it’s okay sit back think things. bad critical thinking skills valued less work/home/school. second lockdown Austria. matter high infection death rates are. highly doubt politicians country especially stupid and/or selfish.

People like that. believe matter what. can't argue emotions matter facts. cases intellectual capabilities understand facts connect dots. get right. Makes sense Unbiased media actual news organizations. point Fauci? Clearly one listens administratiion real authority power.

Mainly they're acting like COVID magically disappear lockdown long enough; Wuhan's eradication success exception, rule. measures places like South Korea Taiwan Singapore took ones could last minimal disruption public life possible. 5 war president, counting. Nope. Lol nice strawman argument I’m introvert, even *I‘m* itching social point. Holy crap; took quick glance ended nosebleed. I’m sorry daughter incredibly rare complication. face incredibly rare (and many less rare) dangers every day lives, yet move on, that’s world works. 

Any number unlikely things happen every school day, yet shuttering schools reserved catastrophic generalized events - like earthquakes, hurricanes, wars - now. Even Spanish flu generally shut schools weeks time. now, we’re apparently okay flushing entire academic year-plus toilet exceedingly rare cases? It’s ridiculous. typical strawman argument... new today, I'm adding Christmas. 2022. Also corona caused 150kish deaths stemming shutdown. :) number deaths Great Depression already! Gooooooooood job government! bullshit  forget also killed Americans Benghazi contrary republican belief. paying attention, stupidest unjust things ever happen. incapacitated right election, lose, die ever receiving justice knowing lost. Right? I'm worried he'll loses election. can't crave, narcissists want burn down. virus != cases.

It's unlikely asymptomatic cases still exist fact known cases guarantee virus gone. Imagine asymptomatic case recently landed international flight took domestic flight masks mandatory. obviously going work. going turn people off. Hello bröther Thanksgiving November here, Canadians October. that’s reason we’re going keep social distancing wearing masks late 2021. We’re prolonging ourselves.  already tried military vote, fica cut paid back loses take vaccine fucks us? anti vaxer wtf man. Trying brand new shit? don’t like buying first version anything dawg. Sure, simple:

* Punish everyone believing Trump. Trump giveth us wonderful economy, Trump taketh away.
* Trump get elected, destroy US economy. punishing us.
* Trump buddies sold stock right set make BILLIONS BILLIONS! confirms military aide responsible carrying 'nuclear football' tested positive weekend traveled president last Thursday New Jersey per @Santucci

I'm afraid BLM, people killing masks scares me. sure getting downvoted, children adults Europe suffered effects drug well. Narrator: White House resistance. sideways me. country already decided pandemic ""over."" 

The pandemic ended checks ran out. Ask Argentina Brazil well free lockdowns work. 750/decade compare Europe, continent population 700,000,000, U.S, country 300,000,000 people??? serious right now, joke haven’t caught onto yet sub brigaded. Also really treatments people got bad case Spanish Flu. imagine without modern medicine, many people currently end hospitalized would died.

Not apples apples comparison. Yeah dexamethasone really worth bad cases. far pnuemonia help, suppresses immune system making vulnerable conditions, heart condition risky. would help mild cases seriously. worth mean usa still aircraft carriers rest world combined think still pretty safe. Also thanks chain command like isnt plan replace dead leaders military. definitely one oddballs. wife still work, work home primary job part time work requires go limited human interaction people coworkers. See 2 friends IRL every week, virtually meet folks weekly games such.

I weirdo could probably live alone apart human life fine. honest, feeling maintain accelerated brazenly awful selfish found behavior fellow citizens (USA) bullshit resistance trying get pandemic control. I've never huge fan crowds, big events, gatherings.

If COVID lockdowns taught anything, really need seriously consider want structure life. love great local amenities like food, healthcare, arts, etc., would seriously consider moving metropolitan area somewhere super rural big COVID takeaway been, ""Fuck selfish pricks"". realize probably unhealthy takeaway, can't deny feel towards lot neighbors. straight pushing fascism. checks balances government power reason. 🤦🏻‍♂️ brawndo got plants crave, it’s got electrolytes. Lol good luck dude. vaccines use new vaccine technologies like RNA. Different standards reasonable...what late developed (seemingly) ad hoc unscientific foundations. 215,700 without excess deaths accounted for. We’re closer 280-290k reality estimates would probably put us 290k-300k range done now. maybe government reached kill quota diseases. possible get ""flu"" season next year  mean literally said covid big deal compared flu Yeah, well says..... Thanks media internet, young Europeans extremely Americanised, point fail distinguish what's happening US what's happening country.

They’re playing mask, mask over, they’re touching it, they’re touching plate. can’t good.” countries guidelines mandates people want small gatherings, Americans seem bizarre idea small private gatherings stopped responsible countries. Never interrupt enemy they're making mistake. Look around you, proof need give you. plenty examples care pay close enough attention surroundings. sources want would require inhumane practices accurate results happen anymore(or least published publicly) good reason, use eyes, judgement brain power.

Saying something based purely sex gives person sense power feel though fault reason chromosomes got. judge person based sex making assumptions generalizations sexist, purely immature arrogant.

Now want talk sexes races compare deaths diseases anything ""Nature"" related that's fine. Nurture place argued sex better what.

The Mythbusters episode battle sexes showed clear day difference behaviors handle things. Everyone handles everything differently, anyone excel one area failing miserably others. I've watched times always gets equal levels, except sports biology get way females.

Now doubt biology play persons personality, genes, mental illness like passed mostly mitigated controlled right environment. Sex play personality determined social network grow in, type nurturing get could depend sex society views taught proper time.

Not case live Florida, Key West vast majority businesses require masks enforcing capacity limits. guess think friends neighbors dying permanent heart and/or lung damage something laugh about. 

We different senses humor guess. country, call _treason_. Israelis get idea politics? government?

WOW figured someone would info lol  America beat score easy come round two. Always been, can't wait leave. [Not looking goid SMH Idiotic stats. 360 million americans army ww2. 3 separate chains:

&amp;#x200B;

1. main ""Americold"" cluster - know one came leading suspect snuck quarantine somehow (see chain #3 hint could've happened). group became cluster.
2. maintenance guy elevator quarantine hotel - transmitted returnee via surface elevator. one go further.
3. returnee flight Christchurch Auckland. He's one initially speculated could've long incubation case. eventually worked #3 chain. positive case MIQ transmitted via surface rubbish bin (prior positive test) another returnee seated behind ""initial"" guy flight. chain stopped 6 cases (I think) damn good contact tracing infectee getting promptly tested + using tracer app (IIRC). bit slacker, one could've gotten lot bigger. Speaking American, know many people refuse believe exists problem, also tend patriotic casualties war. War unites nation (it tells people together attack ""the enemy"") ""the enemy"" seen safety measures based politics, Covid treated united front, 3rd leading cause death yearly America first 8 months here, without counting excess 200,000-300,000 deaths since Feburary. Still, second point, I'm sure died splinter forget account time. Accounting time, data shows 8 months Covid-19 death toll equivalent 50 years war (something often last ditch effort avoided due possible blood shed). Now, 10 years people, 3-4 die COVID yearly, someone says ""Covid killed million!"" big since, ya know treat it, know transmitted, vaccines it. Right now, real threat trying force reality check prompted. apologies. I'm referring one replied to. I'm sure sarcastic not. getting pretty close. purposely ignoring I'm saying. skin mean hand touch it, mean sanitize enough kill it, mean transfer ""OPEN HOLE"" like big mouth stupid hands. also suspected Trump knew tested positive days announced it, quickly rushed hospital put oxygen. /r/shermanposting Winter coming going wrong calculation 7.5 million catching COVID-19. sane person thinks testing catching even close cases, that's many people ***tested positive*** COVID-19.

You're comparing many people ***estimated*** caught flu last year, many people *tested positive* flu last year.

If want estimation many people caught COVID-19 USA, try range 4-10x higher *tested positive* numbers. coronavirus killed Vietnamese, korean, iraqis, afghans americans did? weren’t. blame them? Though may likely want avoid virus. Win win.

Edit add: like image article. It’s good choice. also Mnuchin senate. long he's there, another stimulus passed. You’re intelligent. Please don’t breed. fascism \#LoadsForAmerica means “the largest group” superlative form “more” means anything else. Slavery binary alters “more not” either slaves slaves. Therefore largest group binary set majority.  saying war bad everyone says is?  You’re intelligent. Please don’t breed. soviet union lost 26 300  000 WW2.  mean? people wearing masks social distancing compared last year America. You’re intelligent. Please don’t breed. one reasons Americans deserve empathy

they tell bs like ""they hate us freedoms"", fact rest world give shit, problems fraction covid deaths entirely due covid That's good point.

But consider generally blaze attitude towards virus USA, ... well, ... help situation first place. absolutely reason call symptoms permanent, indeed seeing clinics “long haul” patients recovering. takes months instead weeks. flu same.amount of.time? boss stop.comparing I’m American personal stake I’m sure least confederates didn’t believe fighting for. goes Germans, fight regardless beliefs 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! really. Restaurants moderate high risk activity (depending setup). People take part moderate/high risk activity likely take part activities put higher risk not. kinda meassures would help? Im also extremely frustrated, almost nothing seems work. also ban video games they're enforcing things actual chance catching COVID-19 someone coughing walk past park ""infinitesimally small,"" B.C.'s provincial health officer said Wednesday.



BC's provincial health officer probably anti mask/hoaxer Trumper tho South Korea's Starbucks patrons might disagree you. agree mind boggling. guess peer pressure really hard escape. imagine would uncomfortable insisting wearing mask, maintaining distance, F2F etc would really hard Trump circle. makes sickening culture Trump embodied. GOP: Yes yes yes

Media: said no...

GOP: said yes, keep up

See stimulus talks that's really bad nation supposedly resources

1) really bad all, yeah great like Germany sitting 150sh per 1 million, still 650 per 1 million (USA) vs 500 per 1 million (France), different. 

2) define ""the resources"", USA also #10 GDP per Capita. US EU basically terms GDP, except EU 100 million people. general though, several European countries ahead US terms GDP per capita. talking about? price groceries increasing pandemic. Americans might like still eat. meat got better quality safer wouldn’t mind increased price tag. go one specific nicer market meat produce buy everything else cheap market. Americans won’t burn shit aren’t burning shit now. He's keeping mouth shut he's still hospital. turtles reptiles amphibians?  Literally one commenter mentioned they’re vegetarian. It’s pretty ironic cast blame towards vegans response article negative effects factory farming. course it’s easy poke holes plan, thing makes sense political expediency base upcoming election. genuinely don’t think cares ultimately happens road, cares staying power he’s keeping support already anti-science base strong. Almost certainly eh lol. never seen atom. know exist. believe do. recommend watch ken burns documentary Vietnam war, 10 episodes one hour-ish each, worth watch. tell us people pretty strong Connecticut too.

The entire point post America can't justify appalling death rate response pandemic 9 countries also done shit job. guy commits assault exonerated neighbour committed murder.
 nice try pushing shitty agenda.
 
I'm literally using marker analysis provided. 216 nations outbreaks, US ranked 206th. contagious, tax dollars go supporting people obese. Ever heard Medicaid? Yeah, flu.... @ $13/hr small company installing security systems/PBX hotels 8-6 monday-thursday (no overtime). also deliver dominoes @ $5.50/hr+tips every night, Friday Saturday. Usually get 40 job one 40 job 2. gulf war Maybe US politicians largely completely botching control virus. That's cop suppresses voice voters have. 

Voters choose local reps go onto national stage.  predictable. tried diminish guy's point irrelevant nonsense thinking speak me, drown ignorance. Wheres content? really empty?  Blame CCP releasing military grade virus! said part sharp increase positive percentage people without symptoms re-tested isolation - good, that's known largely pointless infectious two weeks anyway. 1) lockdown? People partying, going restaurants bars vacationing, even huge infection numbers city. lockdown, about? 

2) 8 months pandemic still herd immunity BS. Enough already. immunity get disease every couple months? geniuses? Huh? want 200,000 dead every single wave? 

3) death matters? Yeah? death matters yeah? ICUs, hospitalisations, long-term effects?

Even painful developing countries.  Sweden's mask advisories likely Sweden's current case rise accelerate deaths again. rofl WWII deaths support narrative? basis comparison? Trump: flu.

That's hellluva return 9 months... okay still using Twitter?!? schools reopen? know LA closed November least. Oh brother... r/nyc subreddit people pissed talking spread outside. WTF - subreddit repeatedly agreed outside = good, ever since BLM protests. rules differ based demographic gathering outside, rule looks fake. Either way, people thinking spreads outside, people going continue self-select society.

Walking around Manhattan yesterday surreal. Loads solo pedestrians wide, almost empty sidewalks masks; diners tables restaurants without masks.

Now, saying loud Cuomo say ""true everyone wear masks inside!"" instead ""people random wear one"" Aren’t people still working home though? Aren’t restrictions still around? thought Singapore still mask mandate? Don’t get wrong I’m suggesting people stop reproducing all. Waiting year (or least vaccine) around won’t hurt anybody. People still many kids want next year. still issue scientists don’t covid affects fetus (it’s found placenta) new borns. Singaporean’s still urged social distance, take risk like this? Oh ok kiddo, maybe take minute google words know use make self look arrogant unintelligent. take time define semantics you, seeing capable. I'd bet even figure out. Americans: *get mad somebody kneels anthem they're diSrEsPEcTiNg sOLdIeRs*

Those Americans: *refuse wear masks 200,000+ deaths much*  Funny thing is, chemtrail believers say wear mask filter chemtrails. problem requiring indoors people taking constantly washing hands touching mask. germs hands touch things germs spread people touch faces faff masks.

I saw guy leaving busy supermarket, take mask put mouth ffs... party line. Sycophants cross Agent Orange risk ostracized.  best make fake arguments win against? like shooting fish barrel! one part. another important thing China goverment able gather resource country use fight virus one city. Wuhan outbreak, every provinces send elite medical team Wu Han. every provinces send supplies Wu Han. also happen Beijing, Hei longjiang Wulumuqi break. 

I think china able control pandemic. Fight conv19 need lot resource. US much powerful China, none state us powerful china.

the problem america Cannot gather resouce front line use resonalbly. humanitarian standpoint, want see anyone denied care. there's denying fun imagine would like say, ""Sorry, man. fake disease. treat here, go home take fake drugs."" “planets” speak of? Clearly earth flat stuff see “sky” elaborate artwork weather-dome. Stop ridiculous, now. Driving agenda? Tell might agenda 140 year old science magazine would it? OK buddy always think history written right people, isn’t. ""Doing well now"" means look recent time period. looking total numbers combining happened start happening now. large difference - 4600 deaths happened March-April-May. 860 June. 260 July. 134 deaths happened August-September-October till now. see improvement? we’re comparing disease man-made destruction, anyone else realize many people die cancer, heart disease, obesity daily basis? Lol \*cue 5,000 comments\* gEt hOMe GyM misleading all. Americans alright, worst ones. Fucking idiots. rate the claim hospitals get paid patients listed COVID-19 ventilators as TRUE.
Hospitals doctors get paid Medicare patients diagnosed COVID-19 considered presumed they COVID-19 absent laboratory-confirmed test, three times patients placed ventilator cover cost care loss business resulting shift focus treat COVID-19 cases Easy solution.

He pay 1/12 wealth tax amount month. millionaire. must Japanese, cause thots players. yet able answer single question I've put you. They're literally undergraduate tier questions anyone working knowledge would know.
 
Do normally lie blatantly get called out? seem worked time. Repeat: *don’t like Trey Songz*  happens allow pathological ideology infest educational system. Looking you, post modern neo marxist democrats.

The CDC says 6% total covid deaths co-morbidity's.  6% 191,211 what... sure. CCP-Virus, probably 191,211 might still alive, fair enough. Certainly old folks NY nursing homes would probably still alive... that's what, 6,500+ deaths there, alone.

Just president giant orange dick end world. Vote worse case, he'll done next term 2024 put asshole oval office again.

It's gonna okay. could repeal tax cuts Republicans gave big corporations upper 1%. *should* repeal anyway. “Sure, video people torturing animals, I'm bothered that.”

You may want talk someone that. Thank you.  great suggestion tbh, includes sure flip races people already well funded. Even people wanna say made lab, whatever, can’t disprove guess. fucking exists. Good point. seems still strong concept ""Union States"" strong state autonomy civil war. sure treason right word succeeding states. could defected cause resulted humans longer property? think agree Civil War sad occasion, black mark country hole, think would say avoidable. 

Unless, course, we'd able agree humans property. people thats always real sticking point. think supposed divide much weighs stone. 

So 60% probably 1%. Glenn Thomas **Jacobs** (born April 26, 1967) American professional wrestler, actor, author, businessman, politician. Republican, **Mayor** Knox County, **Tennessee**. professional wrestling, **Jacobs** signed WWE, known ring name Kane. Check facts. Local means nothing, even know good level cruelty 0, even excluding slaughter process. Milk cows carry 10 times amount milk would wild bodies used it. puts lot stress bodies. eggs chickens lay 359 eggs year rather 15 50 would wild, I'm entirely sure. strains lot causes many diseases would result chicken killed. also makes use lot nutritients normally many definencies. Chickens, turkeys animals grow fast develop many diseases get broken bones. good. best thing could terms animal welfare also meat rasing herd cows massive area want kill quickly make sure stress, sadly impossible would say go plant pased get that, that’s sensible. want people make effort make amends, say, “my bad.” they’re truly sorry, they’ll put effort undoing wrong. everyones ideas right . people wrong. someone idea 1+1=5, idea wrong. hear you... best solution good two weeks proper lockdown, completely change momentum virus (experienced first-hand Canada). Surely would people need financial assistance period; people would compensated government. Combine mandatory protective equipment (front-line workers wear surgical masks visors) citizens wear surgical masks time indoors (not home). seriously flatten curve. Although shame science become politically polarized people unwilling follow guidelines, possible flatten curve without extreme economic repercussions. Unfortunately, concerts, bars, restaurants would take backseat period unable think plans render services safe public health. displeasing turn-of-events, something must face abnormal time.

Quick note: hospital capacity dangerously low, things much safer. Flattening curve isn’t necessarily purging world virus, conscious effort day-to-day lives give dire hospital space really need it... covid patients, also cancer patients, victims heart attacks, etc. know project ignorant toughness. I'm bit ashamed myself. guy vehemently opposed marijuana, ok killing one whopper time. None makes sense.  Jensen said, ""Hospital administrators might well want see COVID-19 attached discharge summary death certificate. Why? straightforward, garden-variety pneumonia person admitted hospital – if they're Medicare – typically, diagnosis-related group lump sum payment would $5,000. COVID-19 pneumonia, $13,000, COVID-19 pneumonia patient ends ventilator, goes $39,000 I’m sure behavior puts good light. come early career doctors make little money? learned show Scrubs well would label parents coronavirus deniers, definitely skeptical situation bad portrayed.

I'm complete opposite leave house without N95 mask on. small row day dad called ""dickhead needs get perspective.""

What can't get head around causes people believe sort thing hoax bog cover something? thing think people looking control situation can't control. know ""truth"" situation, gives feeling reassurance really know crack is.

That could complete bollocks honest. But, explanation type behaviour think of. Knox County Tennessee  It’s like others said, worries potential theft concern profitability areas. corner store becomes grocery often don’t healthier options do, often expensive. supermarket area, it’s often good ways away involve multiple bags public transit often don’t car. Many times also working multiple jobs varying schedules even could get healthier food time cook becomes issue. mother weekly cooking Sunday reason. It’s difficult living food desert.  affects people. friend want potentially infest virus go play Russian roulette contract not, means someone looking health loved ones health attack belittle wearing mask, keeping distance please, staying indoors...  Hospital administrators discovered new way save money... think they're going ever go back buying ppe like used to? without regulations teeth require get enforced. UK? Lol Womp, womp !! Yes done comedians entering bubble hanging one another hours time indoors. comedians quarantine 2 weeks beforehand. shut up? part wish dead.  nurse more, TONS friends former colleagues risking lives help strangers. couple died. telling they're liars coordinated, global hoax? Yeah, go hell die. 

 Oh, send dead friends back families. find waiting room Hell, guess. Sitting coronavirus hoax section. 

 literal way karma work people like this. Like exempt receiving health care. Active disinformation sharers marked, drop clasping throats, gasping air ambulance called rush get immediate care, would way crew take one look like ""eh, coronavirus denier. Never mind, boys, let's let one die street!"" Deny shit drive away, save someone accusing liars faking this. Hahahaha holy shit

What next, prophet 3rd world countries already like this. wealthy eat farmed meat, poor forced Bush markets buying gamey wild meats. fact, that's got whole DAMN pandemic mess begin with. wet market wuhan. Dystopian Future Achieved!! really sick, cautious asthma? It’s Israel, probably absolutely zero malice normal abrupt conversation Sure, absolutely people can’t convinced. wish weren’t, it’s important make effort. way eliminate intransigent society I’d favor it. worked BioRad South San Francisco 2006, interested qualifying wife child internet. system completely collapses ""profits"" mean nothing money social construct.

People died this. Right? That's works all. non-dischargable debt large life insurance parents policy her. hope end fiscally crippled top everything else. look per capita (death numbers). equal US would need additional 793,144 deaths.

Or total infections .... would need another 32,264,166

Or tests ... additional 38,912,611 tests level US per capita basis.

All numbers India huge ... 16.25% worlds population.  aware *voluntarily joining* crazy society, born it.  
That said, individuals need declare President like sovereign citizen mostly whatever want, within reason. thought pizza “believing me” zero consequence me. I’m work break treating patients who, like you, defend unnecessary risks death (literally). don’t time explain entire concept risk analysis you, since don’t want accept basic breakdown already explained. So, can’t take enough responsibility yourself, that’s you. nice day. Exactly. people think go away November election. Like sports leagues decided say hell making money influence election. believe rest world conspired influence election. people stupid congratulate you. I'm surprised they're even letting leave city. Kudos putting family first deciding take life back, despite people subreddit might tell you, probably get flak comment sELfIsH later. Sounds like Melbourne. Insane they're there. Good luck move man. Read declaration independence again, king betrayed us. 

Also constitution obligates states remain union, seccession treason. illegal leave union, something states voted agreed to. Fucking Confederates. 

And thank god left england, wound saving entire planet german rule. Twice. America Got Talen live audience. fine eating big animal meat eat small fish chickens. might beef liver while. Although I’m perfect, feel getting away large animals helps sustain world longer. already literally holding public ransom presidency. 
No deal get passed “after win”. pretty fucking clearly shows priorities lame duck session. don’t time google you, trust handle www.google.com research intricacies risk analysis works prediction models produced. replace with... ""i hardly knew him, prefer sycophants get infected!"" good question would be,what % Americans receive flu shot annually? many schools open, conditions allowed open?

(right now, need file state want open school). think reason count would still hit half million Yes, countless others caused factory animals. There's swine flu avian flu name few. Keeping animals slaughter houses torturing lives poor conditions hotbed diseases. Poultry farmers get avian flu often. Also, there's bigger problem antibiotic resistant superbugs explain simply - pump factory animals antibiotics sorts shit help grow big die. virus bacteria also life forms looking survive evolution keeps coming better ways overcome existential challenges means virus bacteria getting immune antibiotics already seen bacteria causes Tuberculosis. Yes, thats terrible, truly. 

The confederate states held *the majority* slaves US, famous torturing, starving, generally dehumanizing mass amounts killing trivial things. 

Also, one half country finally said ""we probably anymore"" side said ""but still want to"" staged coup it. 

And dont know anywhere near enough countries histories slavery conversation them, see could remotely relevant American Civil War. Nobody every argued American South place slaves. ones hissy fit told humans anymore. *Morons someone asks believe Earth round not, say ""no"" without context, obviously people assume think flat. willfully misinterpret question want congratulate knowing, ""*well actually*, sphere"", smart. two hospital beds

Lol. scenario, banning everything preventable ridiculous? Got it. Thanks. I’m focused New York idea rules California schools used think constant testing White House gave sense security. Easy laugh masks everyone interact tested daily. Unfortunately super spreader got testing screen didn’t use mask backup. ‘Ok, won’t need treatment’ need evidence it’s fricken common sense. person thinks it’s safe eat place strangers, sans mask, likely think it’s safe spend afternoon family members house without mask. Yes, billionaires paying zero tax extracting billions dollars wealth society = bad.

Thank coming TED Talk. many f#$@#g idiots world Oh no!

Anyway... He'll use Tucker Carlson defense, nobody right mind ever believed first place. Would say people died live apartment paper thin walls?  mental problems defend bet impression everyone tested daily, looks. Like Trump tested quite time now. He's super spreader. fair may worse him. Doesn’t make easier/better others obviously. girl I’m friends said time month worse COVID her. Super weird. fuck wrong you? Waiver Reopening Schools

On July 17, 2020, California Department Public Health (CDPH) announced waiver state’s school reopening criteria may available elementary schools. waiver within jurisdiction California Department Education State Board Education, instead considered local public health officers, consultation CDPH.

For information, please see [COVID-19 Reopening In-Person Learning Framework K-12 Schools California, 2020-2021 School original comment says ""flu"" ""spanish flu"" would vastly different meaning.

if i'm reading figure correctly highest peak 1750/100k happen beginning spanish flu happened towards end. graph year would around 75/100k something compare spanish flu beginning stages. know happen covid winter, comparing apples apples instead apples oranges stuff like this. 

one issue making comparison general advanced 100 years testing, treatment, health mortality rate disease today much less 100 years ago. virus care conspiracies. like teacher school liked say misbehaving students: ""You're sorry, sorry got caught."" mindset. Uh, no. land border restrictions announced March 21, 2020 due Covid-19 —and extended month since then— extended again. land border United States Mexico remain restricted ‘essential’ crossings least October 21st, 2020. Air travel United States Mexico remains unrestricted. News extension confirmed September 17, Mexican Ministry Exterior. makes angry. every American angry this. lmao wondered briefly point trying make, worded extremely poorly. think genx quite earned stupid reputation, since measure millenials, zoomers, n shit would even worse (though i'm sure would agree ;)

 people article special type stupid Typical Trumpish character. Throw minions bus! yikes sounds like unnecessary extra expense. ask Herman Cain. thing complaining something would help people dollar, meanwhile president who's paid $750 taxes 10 years got best medical treatment covid money buy tax dollars. point considered endemic? stop sacrificing 15 million people CANNOT WORK HOME PRODUCE THINGS PUBLIC? Generational debt widespread depression grow every day. Kill whole economy sit front computer. First Tegnell certainly discouraged use masks. Making statements mask usage could dangerous would course discourage use. Finland stretch gold standard. middling category. sort ok. Like places like Germany, Canada etc. worst worse U.K., Italy, Sweden etc. gold standard taiwan, Korea, hk, Oz, nz, Vietnam etc. 
Sweden’s testing still average best. 
As 22. Don’t know. Don’t care. Well Germany every federal state declare rules every cities impose local measures too, react faster. Berlin control, bars restaurants/cafes need close 11 pm 6 every day. Driving kill people COVID-19 annually. even close. Bruh.... Downvotes upvotes make money.  


My business ;) dies heart attack afterword they're found Covid body. 

SARS-CoV-2 literally attacks heart muscles cells express ACE2 (the receptor SARS-CoV-2). uncommon find heart issues COVID patients including heart failure. link something showing idea propaganda zero merit?

The CDC's comorbidity numbers.  Notice vast vast vast majority comorbidities direct result viral infection. guess assuming spread other. No, would definitely still get passed today. See restrictions vaping popping up. tragedy. /s Hate defeatist attitude. Masks social distancing going fly either. people make change leadership demonstrating new social norms. making statements like that, contribute problem self fulfilling prophecy. Thats true, forgot Texas. Texas outlier. total 14 states joined union, rest created territories. dumbest thing I’ve read day.  Yes literally believe whole world making up. think shadowy groups 'elites' planned whole thing, they're directing doctors scientists nurses etc lie, tricking somehow thinking real, hospitals really empty, patients families deceased paid actors, one really dying it, faking people died normally covid, elites establish 'new world order' cackle got good control 'sheeple' wear masks. Oh, whole point roll vaccines actually microchip you, mind control you, used kill people reduce population.

No idea would actually work real life, wanted kill lots people shadowy elites release deadly virus kill people instead going convoluted way, already 'vaccine' that's really microchip they'd pretending takes ages make instead rolling asap, scientists doctors world it, etc etc. makes sense, terrifying people believe stuff. read that, actually caused death emergency vehicles get through? take advice doctor carefully selected tell wants hear! Take science! could moved assuming got practice game? think it’s poor people disease doesn’t impact pure, aryan genes Assuming one vaccines effective, approved begin rolling within next months. Everyone keep downvoting guy Note resident-- early-career doctor essentially indentured, working 80 hour weeks minimum wage.

Her family left pay loans medical school-- know much owes, $300,000+ debt common. Hahaha keep crying. cant escape lmao... restrictions completely worthless Yes. entire world leaders somehow
managed create idea fake virus. The. Whole. World. world (leaders) cannot come consensus climate change world peace./s funny. 🏅 stuff known Virus's 100 years seems ridiculous people. Look Panama canal. french tried build it, paid price understanding diseases/virus's spread. took exactly believe even understand why, said, ""hey think Mosquitos may something this, lets get rid best can."" Thus canal built. 100 years ago people listened stuff probably thought black magic. information need people use it. plenty precedent regards workplace safety regulations.

It's different COVID: main question whether proven employer negligent transmission occurred result said negligence.

No different established precedence workplace safety.

I find humorous day age, [we seemingly forgotten events like Triangle Shirtwaist Factory shaped workplace safety regulations protected American workers' lives decades. Reddit back then, I'm sure someone would saying dangerous path go people injured unsafe working conditions start winning. I'm sure plenty cases company crap job maybe fault. line keep moving dangerous goes far either way. 

How go far talking wellbeing safety fellow Americans? People families, loved ones, friends? 

Ridiculous. fascinating many people choose fabricate complicated myths rather face simple truth. Seems universal human condition.

do call people skeptics. word means. deniers. skeptics require sound science evidence abundance COVID. people science deniers. random things I've thinking today. 

1. [This analysis USA's current situation days know random twitter account, seems report things pretty honestly updates concise thorough like believe they're accurate, sources numbers (all Covidtracking). interests third graph, would appear USA's % positive rate declining since late July, less 0.5 percentage points low point reached June, right outbreak US southern states. nobody talking this? also considering fact running 1 million+ tests single day sometimes, point ""lack testing"" invalid test big country. pretty big? Hospital census pretty close low point June ICU census far well.

2. Another thing update, shows vent usage time low since started counting covid. think conclude ventilator craze back March/April mistake probably cost harm good. legitimately think probably venting patients quickly back probably need all. know though, thankfully. 

3. Another point declining positivity - point start talking false positives? test 1 million people day, sometimes. say average false positive rate million tests approx. 1%, that's 10,000 false positives. Even say approx 0.5%, that's 5000 whole cases. fair though, also balance false negatives, gets iffy there. Still, think attention brought point, especially considering much importance place case counts now. [This article provides 



4. Crappy public health messaging. think one main things people agree public health messaging throughout absolutely terrible. think deep dive crappy messaging ""experts"" ""leaders"" giving people pandemic taking apart bit bit harmful caused people misunderstand virus, NPIs, tenets phenomenon would make excellent report even PhD project. mean, much stuff like helping people? (also holy mother ratio'd second link) two examples, many could pulled various state authorities. mixed messaging overall detrimental sort cause towards getting people take precautions imo. 

Well anyway, would love know guys' thoughts. Yes, personal choice. Along fast food heart disease, alcoholism liver disease, etc. That's ultimately question US civil war answered. States could leave Union. 

States indeed join Union American revolution USA expanded significantly. Republic Texas example this? worth, lost hope Bernie lost nomination. says coronavirus thread? read post. Thanks playing along. even directly experience it, either part show circumstance affecting them. Sick nearly die COVID ward? flu maybe government agencies killing speaking truth. Whatever's convenient truth. Question:

I conversation someone yesterday talking hospitals governors (he said Cuomo specifically) using COVID deaths way get funding money federal government. asked sources made seem political game hospital state abuse lie it’s numbers receive money compensation people getting dying COVID. 

I guess question follows correct rather read told true? 

I know hospital entitled funding treat patient tested COVID positive, symptoms necessary treated medication even ventilator. wanna answer people try tell people trying game numbers it’s sort cash scheme haven’t found anything outside hospitals that's cynic is. Danger true? least box rocks get social media spread disinformation, like President hoaxers. think backwards...WE receive level care do. received level care rest us, would something it. 20000 daily tests, 3000 come back positive = 15% positive rate. 
In order country loosen restrictions, need less 5%... Well then.... tracking chip. 

Don't tell actually believe even possible put tracking chip vaccine... Like, would work? people sub fucking ridiculous. Really? Non contagious, preventable deaths acceptable simply they’re contagious?

Car fatalities fine it’s contagious? Completely ignoring fact car accidents kill people drivers fault time?

COVID bad it’s causes illness death, way around Fuck British shitty rulers. ruled country saved german rule. whole planet would speaking german country. times. Twice germany tried fuck entire planet twice United States saved day. Everyone alive today owes freedom United States.  Ok buddy. lead 30,000,000 people lost jobs 210,000 dead 8 months? Humm. Try again. virus early days spreader detectable test 60+% Swedes still support Tegnell decpite total sociopath.

Atleast Trump actually loses support saying dumb shit could also mostly asymptomatic 

they young great shape ""Never let good crisis go waste. ""

this sort nonsense people digging heals things covid. 

While core issue real, issue also hyped used move unrelated political agendas.

Sort Global Warming. Crime Humanity. Get drunk screw. airline pilot who's ubering summer, great. 

/s White House become like evil headquarters world. 

Nothing good comes it. Oh definitely agree. I’m still planning social distancing, wearing mask, following recommendations long necessary. Even vaccine released, I’ll still like said don’t know reactions vaccine itself. I’m sure that’s best use. lot people nursing homes dying covid, covid. average time nursing home like 6 months. Better prioritize first responders Still yet, told would now. add me. 4 flu seasons visible there, baseline deaths higher winter mortality may way include flu deaths. covid death bump bigger flu bumps last 4 years - 10-100 times bigger. Even rushed vaccine, doubt many people would dumb enough get vaccine quickly made. Vaccines take years make need lots trials know effects it’s going cause 110,000 Americans, others traitors. That’s insult real prisoners smh reason arrived debate late tested. never going back ☹️  wasn’t cold storage ? trillions dollars transfer payments important part. Stimulus negotiations also included $25 billion vaccine funding--the government program actual end crisis rather making slightly less painful. Without money, BARDA already [turn away promising vaccine lack funds. Forgot /s. good thing leaders actually know acted decisively January found bad going prevented something like happening. Oh wait... Yea I'd say around 1.4-1.5 mil official deaths end year excess deaths probably passed 2 mil already. Yes! Bring back concerts festivals! Gladly wear mask means again. Outdoor seating sides separted wide isle. See photo example safe seating arrangement. deal Alberta. weather got nice game over. I’m sure Trump maybe say soon vaccine announced

Trump already saying open things now, months. Fortunately people can't force stupidity. watching dragged WH Jan 20 one person's take subject. may come shock every grocery store curbside. Especially immigrant communities live. Delivery also 2x surcharge since bougie stores across town delivery. Babysitter shopping? Lol. sitter working 2 hours. Sitters minimum $100 amount time near me. I’m paying every week. That’s absurd. Maybe step privileged bubble sometime. We’ve avoided bars, restaurants, parties, family gatherings, play dates, basically everything makes life worth living part. I’ll damned smug Redditor going tell buy food essentials family. also go week weekend jam packed people won’t take risk. somehow ended elected president.

That somehow called electoral college, reason still exists day age.. knew would be. Biden presidency better make fine people wearing mask. faster faster ends faster go back wearing masks. Imagine state country competent leader. needed mandatory lockdowns , enforced social distancing, mask policies, part, would over. half country appalled fact wear mask help others. 
We’re run greedy selfish lack compassion something simple wear mask forty minutes grocery store every then. 
I’m happy majority countries handled pretty well, U.S embarrassed citizens, made us even laughing stock already were. vaccine enough that's bad. That's say. finish line sight us going social distance rest lives. Nice comment guy-blow 😂 Ok? question is, raising standards specific vaccine? vaccines makes need level safety? ,😂 one injury (stabbed pen knife) deaths... Texas pretty fucked well. Looks like prediction 3 months ago still lookin good. Great success. hospitalizations. get quote plumber least ballpark estimate labor various parts. hospital, could $500 $50,000 ask front desk, billing department, insurance idea much charged get pissed you. study showed anti-psychotics blunted immune system. could play factor patients medications.

Edit: Found Hence local elections matter. It’s state governments draw maps, census year, whoever wins locally decide maps next 10 years. I'm hospice nurse. keep calling funeral homes people. Stay home. easier hire /marry someone internally pass notes/dictums/queries confidentially Putin. got mine today! add todays number 6.

Fingers crossed get zero really soon. ""In fair election"" statement giving comfort. 


All foreign IPs blocked United States' Internet network 72 hours period, day election. Let rest world learn news means - cable news like. trust Russia trying outright hack polling and/or tabulating machine/process.  Humans always dumb. constant record it. I'll sword fighting ya. restaurant staffers need sue Trump good thing leaders acted decisively January found bad going prevented something like happening. Oh wait... Makes sense, expect borders appreciated sides there.

WA I'm similar rules, although truck drivers etc required show recent proof negative test enter. Dude. shit here. looked three months bid multiple times. Finally got house couldn’t even think it, make offer right start process. thought already reported this... mean, report numbers deaths infected currently maps incidences? 2.8 million annual deaths obesity globally PER YEAR. million confirmed deaths covid globally October 6th. Maybe 2 million account under-reporting deaths. Personally think circulation shit memes social media general disinformation came start pandemic x amount flu deaths year x deaths covid. children mental health problems live fear. economy cause deaths virus ever could ect. Ect. Ect.

It becomes political typically points given right. left tends think socially, thus lives worth sacrifice keep economy going.

I'm sure digress points tend muddle together often seems come types people(such coworker) 1 viewpoint tends also partnered others. Yeah 99% people type 2 diabetes, overweight, sedentary choose lifestyle. often people hosting block parties house parties. punishing everyone obeys law. democrats wonder fuck 50% country votes republican calls racist ""It affects virtually one"" ~20% workforce lose ~50% work capacity permanent, think happens economy long term? 

I see: 

* Lower future earnings = lower future private spending

* Welfare/disability budget blowouts = higher future government spending

On side call that:

* Healthcare form patchup jobs/tests/drug maintenance regimes = higher spending, comes guarantee higher insurance premiums

* Psychologists going huge demand foreseeable future due everyone healthcare minimum needing it. Donald trying blackmail America. Thanks actual empathy. It’s embittering nearly every response telling coworkers shut quit. 

Nevermind idiotic juvenile response is. study show effectiveness masks all. shows opening bars &amp; restaurants cause spike cases, closing got rid it.

There's way could tease separate effect masks data had.

[Figure 7 research gives away. 

Masks probably help, study way proves it. Black Death Friday mean Republicans. Democrats congress voted passed multiple relief bills. Republicans refuse take senate vote Agreed. That’s I’m worried taking vaccine unless it’s safe side effects. definitely take anything Trump comes Herd immunity achieved much lower 70%. Stop spreading fear said, brought places problems specifically India's, starts fragile state governance begin with. really want proper comparison, let's use China. 1 billion population, similar period economic political development obviously different results. China's total deaths less 5000 - nationwide. affected city, wuhan, accounted 95% numbers, yet city recovered late March early April. compare India China obviously China better state economically nationally, even developed country yet. point looking US inept president biased medical system, perfectly capable people screwed politics. India screwed iept governance still poorly developed infrastructure. let's see month well India does.  People non-compliant continue need anti-COVID measures. People fed absolute idiots things never took seriously, whinging serious thing they've never taken seriously continuing impinge lifestyle.

A month two it'd common sense widespread America. Crazy thing *most* people earn far mean average income, people surely come ahead even basics income taxation.

That's even mentioning things govt provide efficiently, like healthcare, things make nicer functional society relying private sector nickel dime everything.

It's something never cease amaze me, people readily convinced vote self interests democracy, someone money told to.  probably going sit well people I'm honestly point I'm questioning fucking point virus measures are. masks/social distancing/lockdowns worked eliminating virus &amp; apparently cases rise back lockdown again? 

Am one thinking maybe need plan B? Rather flamed apparently trying kill people questioning it?

My 1 year old locked half life. can't take kids see sport play inside basically reason.

 kids longer welcome church SD &amp; case wander around like kids spiritual guidance &amp; anyone express concerns say greater good &amp; fuck you. ""Suffer little children"" said Jesus except need god suppose.

We've following fucking rules well people followed rules would over. that's true it. There's magic bullet &amp; vaccine cause go away guess we'll stay bunkers shouting wear mask people we're dead.

I'm sure point post is, guess want shout void I'm mentally breaking fucking point. Great, willing admit people get asymptomatic. What’s point locking then? Sup I’m safe manner, would say tell people know died. can’t enjoy anymore, deadly worse flu reason trump even awake full drugs available anyone else still could get worse next days. Sorry I’m going scientist one random person telling it’s big deal. already Country lost 210,000 Americans, million worldwide months. yeah it’s serious point is, anti-vaxxers people don’t trust vaccines conspiracy theories. That’s it. can’t pick choose, unless you’re echo chamber.

I don’t think shaming people take vaccine developed top scientists world, tested approved worlds gold standard regulatory agencies. Even want say % political pressure, amounts statistically insignificant effect vaccines safety efficacy (if all). 

Stop Anti-Vaxxer. live area real dinguses take seriously, yet antagonized wearing one. Id making list places never visit mean feel like general public ignore like they’ve already ignoring best practices. CDC says 655,000 still substantial. 1 4 deaths. Probably mainly preventable too. seems counties going crazy rural counties don’t lot shopping/tourism anyway Nah lol

I need pearly whites pull ashamed judging thinking I’m downplaying death general.

You know exactly doing. Well, good. No, they're still unsure started - current working theory maintenance worker picking virus elevator buttons. They're also speculating one branch cluster caused virus transferred rubbish bin lid inside one quarantine hotels. 600 point swing yes. I. Talking companies like Pfizer moderna specifically. release product doesn’t work causes severe side effects they’d fucked It’s figure entire world.  Hey man start pandemic gym equipment costs skyrocketed reason line thinking right lead immediate surge infections deaths vaccine released. 

Keep mind first vaccines likely provide sterilizing immunity, decrease symptoms. probably less effective elderly obese, main risk groups. anyone remember life Trump honestly can't delusional consider ""minor virus"". me. blame China’s government lying stopping citizens flying country spreading everyone. entire year would’ve much different virus never spread. responsible. US banned international travel much earlier, much else could done without impeding states’ rights enshrined constitution. Rules thee Exactly. I'm fucking bored house. wanna hang friends holy fuck people understand situation in. Nope you’re accurate statement Pandemic weird that. I’ve gotten far matches I’ve ever gotten dating apps, responses/actual conversations. also zero dates (for obvious apocalypse reasons). Hint: Theyre bad.  attend event White House day super spreading event there. Air Force Times statement, Coast Guard public affairs director Rear Adm. John Hickey said Ray attended event Gold Star families White House Sunday, Sept. 27. one day White House held event Rose Garden nomination Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court justice, multiple attendees tested positive unfortunately sides ruled radicals lose clout negotiate Yeah, might smoke Trainwreck chill home night... Add list truly sad things goddamn country.  Can't say surprising. moderation team really tried tamp time ""high quality"" information. tried hard prevent discussion topic Bright forced replaced labradoodle America. country. responsible way another debate would virtual. He's risking many lives. guy CDC said mass access vaccine Summer. old ""blame intern"" excuse Honestly respect that. remember surrender Appomattox Courthouse, General Grant said something along lines of, “Put weapons, men, brothers again.”  time everyones gonna get become immune die... Like spanish flu US deaths WWII 291,600. Excess deaths due Covid-19 300,000 Trump may top FDR's numbers. bigly. Yeah way see it, concerts fun type people chill, tend take seriously, wear mask, socially distance, go them.

If go break quarantine concert you’re going surrounded mostly brain dead dickheads. type people would randomly try start fight good reason (maybe thought looked funny.)

The bars like too. chill people make social interaction fun aren’t right now. They’re mostly filled shitheads society instead. Going say bad analogy. People choose smoke drink. Young soldiers forced something. one proper measures walking covid. Comparing smokes, drugs, alcohol, health concerns relevant. war analogies work didn’t choose surrounding “authorities” helping. Total combined? Maybe, think that's ignoring psychological effect deaths. We're constantly bombarded death statistics telling us 200,000 Americans died Covid. Even think true half people would lived couple months, still think pretty low hanging fruit protect people big impact people see disease. one selling points Trump start wars.

Can find monkey paw lock away already. Good curiosity, trolling?  Okay, things person private citizen did, office?

I actually referring impeachment. IMO, impeachment really works threat person office, specially numbers Congress, Senate Supreme Court. person committed crime, already investigation elected, tried private citizen.


Sexual harassment civil cases, tax evasion, RICO, treason, even abuse authority still cases private individual, necessarily Trump, charged with, person left office committed person citizen person office official acts elected official. based science

by Ivor Cummings, better known Fat Emperor conclusion novel coronavirus spreading population runs course. number sources confirms view lockdown virus moving population little, any, additional impact death compared basic distancing good handwashing. 

well, people practice safe distancing etc might case....

He entitled opinion course, best see way qualified subject. due respect ignore opinion favour actual experts field.

But sure - Oz lockdown ""flatten curve"" swamp health care system. 

I imagine UK similarly motivated. Nobody thought would STOP Covid. tame growth/infections / #CaseDemic (stupid word)

Did see freezer trucks NY bodies overflowing morgues? great look.  Lockdown purpose.  

The USA screwed though. little choice mask hope get infected bad case. Ooohhh, spicy burn think rollout could complete 6 months tops, yes. even need foreign adversaries lift finger political sub, expect propaganda like this. also election time, it’s incessant even non-political subs.  think it’s roids. everyone agreement CDC here, right? 

Funny CDC untrustworthy White House patsy came recent report IFR, bastion accuracy aligns preconceived biases. They’re dead now...  “MASKS DONT WORK!”

Fuck guy Somebody explained plot friend zoned mary sue (who immediately perfect everything every skill loved everyone realize it) wandering around university bitching student loans... just... accurate. ruined books think reading them. First wave people panic actually take measures. people ""got used it"" went crazy. Kind like shut cases dozens hundreds yet thousands ""not bad"". another waste time. They'll probably backtrack too. love messing people's routines much possible pretend like they're anything. Why? me... it’s logical conclusion: action take keep safe *also* keeps giving others. don’t currently worry giving others since that’s already covered fact I’m taking strong actions get myself.

Its ‘all squares rectangles, rectangles squares’ situation. didn’t care much getting it, might go hang friends family, quarantine 2 weeks next visit prevent potentially passing on.

Edit: realized *completely* missed point.... yeah, people don’t care getting *and* don’t care potentially giving others jerks. Oh, know! I’m saying, remember back March people like “it’s bad”? Well 3-month-old virus point. yeah, let’s give baby full year data, *really* see “not” bad - crappy skewed underreported data, is. build memorial? (Serious question). remembrance day.... (once over) say would now? 

""Hopefully get vaccine Fall/Winter need worry much anyway""

That statement. Looks like least one vaccine, maybe multiple, reasy least EU end Fall likely widespread end Winter. heard Doctor say something along lines “we know transfered aerosols, therefore actually travel greater distance six feet. Oh? Really? spreads fast? would NEVER put two two together!!!🙄 ""just restaurant workers""?

How everyone served, families went home to? 

I'm disgusted entire GOP. conscience, empathy, ethics they've displayed, deserve trouncing top bottom ballot. think everybody gonna get vaccine soon comes out? soldiers weren’t decision makers. It’s like individual soldier murdering slaves like ss Jewish people. get coming from, look NYC April: 500 1000 people per day dying. hospitals overwhelmed point airlifting dozens patients upstate every day. dead bodies stored freezer trucks morgues full. inmates building mass grave sites Potters Field. Nearly 40,000 people NY, NJ, Long Island, Westchester died month. shut city, within month took control disease. may point risk tolerant order return normalcy, think initial shutdowns well justified. Okay, I’m going half-defend post. Probably way poster wanted, there’s truth here.

Most men fought confederacy fight protect institution slavery. Americans still deserve respect.

HOWEVER, reason actually fighting largely choice. confederacy created men owned slaves key often stated purpose creation confederacy preserve institution slavery. men, however, cowards generally willing put lives risk. demanded plebs it.

Fuck confederacy.

Signed - Descendant Slave Owing Plantation Owner Given UK much smaller us it’s like 75 thousand new us cases That's narrow definition. grew exurb normal human definition quite rural. Lots people farms hunted food, 4h huge, 4k people town middle school served entire county plus part another neighboring county. 20 miles Cincinnati many kids lived subdivisions looked fairly suburban, surrounded corn fields cows miles miles.

I... accept definition frankly think many sociologists would either. state enforced masks, could open safely. hate wearing stupid thing denying make huge difference, especially public, naïve. 52500 Benghazi attacks, 70 9/11 attacks. She’s older that. grew hometown. younger sister year older me. Im guessing 35 least. lazy actually look anyone know 2 months data participant's last shots FDA needs EUA approval? Society everyone. Hell.. 60,000 Americans died last year's flu. means Covid 3.3x lethal flu.

Not end world. Yeah let's disband agency responsible safety food medicines refuse put politics safety. awesome take Let's say, hypothetically, right (you're not, let's say are) hospitals attributing deaths Covid nothing Covid. explain literally hundreds thousands deaths normal level? Please, give even slightly plausible explanation. Also summer humidity Florida problem. baffles me. one person much arrogance???   Yeah.... kinda don’t buy that. think there's confidence boost. don't, generally see conspiracies unless reasonable options make sense. think people speak mind actually proud support President, that's they're represented. may well ton things happen first, negative immediately makes people likely comment/post. I'm hardliner means. spent significant amount youth social liberal economic conservative. realized family benefitted social safety net, changed views. However, something said someone always asking certain project is: financially sound, public's best interest, could done efficiently. I'm middle aged, American conservatism different young. liberal Republicans conservative Democrats. vaguely remember Nixon, Reagan administration created ""100% us 100% us"" type politics become norm. people also laid groundwork current ratfucking democracy that's happening. 

Sorry lengthy, stream consciousness, needed point economic conservatism US always ""handing money people need money."" people always existed, platform.

Edit: young vote '84, would voted Mondale. I've deal way times. traitor American unless they're expatriated. get pretend horrible people group you. Americans fought died slaves. one contact trace, although effect thing. Everyone school building perhaps 25 people quarantine suddenly co-worker reported it. victim reported taste smell gone, sort cemented quarantine. Apparently can’t say name another sub seems uncivil. Anyways. 


The anti lockdown sub links 2 instances covid 19 incorrectly listed death certificate..  thread asking links proof types things came 2. 210K. Pretty damning evidence. Give time :) Honestly pretty much title. Trump wanted vaccine election day try get boost. FDA tried put vaccine regulations WH tried shut down, FDA released anyway. basically make impossible vaccine come Nov 3. wedding turn out? talking Moderna's mRNA vaccine, first kind question underscores really cutting corners terms safety monitoring understanding new technology. Moderna clinical-stage company, meaning never developed vaccine FDA-approved.

This like company never made commercialized vehicle making world's first helicopter car government wants everyone drive done safety tests. mmmmmm nah, people trying keep Americans enslaved, raped, destroyed. Pretty stupid idea, man - evil mind imagine Replace ""tourism"" ""oil money"" Ivermectin... equine polyclonal antibodies! horses!

Re ivermectin, study carried Institute Tropical Diseases Research (IIET), National University Salta, revealed ivermectin causes elimination virus early stages infection.

That's that's stated publicly study, far. formal report expected soon.

I posted find following brand-new approach. heard Equine serum

I'm pretty happy headcanon Kvothe complete bullshitter made legend himself, end.  could still catch that’s don’t want happen. Holy shit that's statistic. That's insane statistic.  

If one I'd impressed. is, hot ready ya 😘 Trump said anything 1 2 million dead based? Amazing American still believes reside free country. person. feel happier masking up, let them. affect you. Fizzling sounds like neuropathy get coronavirus That's nice ""Independant"" puppet European state. Grab ammunition pick side.
War show right, left. Ah yes, smirky arrogance definitely comes territory. 

(Not really trying hostile, resist) people saw coming back March shut everything made society rely tech corporations survive killing small businesses.

No one could ever seen coning. /s Well, nobody right mind *should* ever believe him. makes sense, depends group sponsor. pandemic, I'd encourage try zoom meetings. many good ones entirely focused religion thankfully. There's flimsy language usual Trump, see denial existence disease. Idiots. Sky failed them. Shocker. dicks gentleman! Factory farming: fairly good plants per David Attenborough, clearly terrible animals. 5-10$ piece going lot health care professionals salary. like dont have, often, school debt higher us nightmares about; order follow protocol expected change dozens time day.    


Plus one buy equipment required stay \*alive\* part job, especially vital public health safety. think misread comment social media. Even basic Google search same, results based past researches. possible disable feature avoid filter bubble effect, however enabled default. 

And terrifying. he's specifically indicated ""for certain populations"" fact. flu much deadly 40. 

how many people figure tested year flu? suspect years flu deaths be? flu magically disappear year? right. already Corona Trump. 

another comment shared source Factory farms like exact opposite social distancing. humans packed lime covid would infected us month. Except read article typical cherry picked time frame, case ""April July"". April 1st Dow 20,900. July 1st 25,750. That's 22.6%. us could've done well billionaires thrown money market. really dont care New Zealand. People may done dont believe coronavirus, coronavirus ain't done us. trust me, believes ability spread it. Let's forget Trump's signal Russia regarding Crimea. far know, never condemned it. right? hate post falsely. actually know nurse wore (n95 respirator, gloves, face shield, gown) moving COVID-19 positive patient quarantined part senior living facility works contracted it. 

She one lucky ones, fever week symptoms lasting effects know of, huge proponent appropriate distancing well. someone reddit telling someone step outside echo chamber isnt ironic thing read today ill shocked.

My point was, way HELL another lockdown bc backlash WAY INTENSE. promise thats case whether want believe not.

Life isnt reddit. guys live fairytale world 1 person dies 1 person gets name called 1 person gets discriminated FULL STOP everything must change.

World dont work way buddy. Bad things happen everyday people hate based skin color sometimes lazy eye 100 reasons. Get thicker skin stop whining complaing day everyday. Go take personal responsibility  war Ba Sing Se Plot Black Mirror? He's narcissistic even consider second killing base sure fire way lose elections. advisors afraid point state maps showing surges happening trump friendly counties right now? Look Iowa. deeply conservative IA-4th district hotspot. base. even. Could switch order updates latest comes first? Agreed. can't see anyone look situation think within year everything's going go back normal, problems going whisk away everything sunshine lollipops.

This decade going extremely rough, fact people can't see jarring me. understand wanting think it, reality world get better, year alone shown that. going get really bad. think many us would go war that.

Bullshit! think would large protests couple weeks people would accept it. heard took Intensive Cake Unit, he's woods yet he's definitely Black Forest. Yes would saying I’m sorry what, lol? You’re spending fortune rerouting life something could potentially end next year? That’s absurd. I've using. They're authorized distributor Powecom (see: http://www.powecom.com/) KN95 pretty cheap now.  Yeah that’s huge problem state. mandate now, yet employees shoppers frequently found wearing masks wearing improperly. Essential stores (eg grocery stores) especially bad this, serious problem since higher incomes afford pay grocery delivery. least, strictly enforcing proper face coverings essential businesses. person care. Ah. Thanks taking coronavirus seriously. Whoever person running account literally nothing charts, data, numbers presented straight covidtracking.com. go download spreadsheets recreate graphs yourself. matter discussion questions put forth, unless depictions numbers factually incorrect? familiar users work, sound vetted many others. Oh sure. I'm referring coronaviruses, thought originate domesticated animals.

My wife felt buggy weeks ago - enough go get tested. However, we've extremely isolated, would mindblowing somehow could gotten something.

But live much closer proximity chickens guinea fowl people. want gross out, we're definitely exposed them. point, think likely got mild flu birds got cold flu bug another human. Cant believes ppl believe garbage There's revolution medicine administration within framework capitalism. Silly you. really. restrictions. Fake Oasis album :) They’re gonna test positive steroids Yeah... big deal right...

Meanwhile, Sweden number deaths per capita September alone, New Zealand total.

New Zealand total 6 deaths since May 1st (160 days). Sweden total 6 deaths since October 1st (7 days). Rubbish, masks completely useless unless hospital crowded indoor places.
This measure mere propaganda dictatorship government. Yup.. forgot sub in. Yup. I’ve always said won’t real change America people can’t iPhones Big Macs. 

Heck BIL leftovers eat required operating microwave Christmas time. chose drive 15 minutes town ways get subway. top it’s intelligence issue. He’s literal genius. Smartest guy know llllloooonnggg shot. normal life stuff isn’t cup tea. last elections actually explain two grown ass adults (in Australia) Liberals liberal.  
They voting Liberal based purely name. Boycott, economic sanction, banishment Olympics, make pay fine, force China donate aid countries. many many ways.

I'm tired people defending China. Thinking ok normal eat dogs, bats wild animals delicatessen. could avoided. Isn’t worse announcement country since pandemic began? Maybe small countries San Marino Monaco could done worse March...

Edit: Chile 8k day  real? fact walmart shown lower prices even take loss order compete local stores kind disproves first point. 

As second point, reality begs differ. Maybe eventually new places, that's still years food desert. never makings varsity athlete. enough let 50k ppl stand shoulder shoulder screaming yelling hours call losing business inconvenience. entire state dead yet? understand. Jesus Christ Almighty. fuck guy's problem? Thank you. yet I’m downvoted saying recovery numbers aren’t accurate lol Yes misinformation targeted poorer people start. ones supposed go work shopping malls similar unprivileged enclosed spaces. told big deal, minimalise protests risks subjected to. 

People higher education may aware virus cause permanent braindamage risk encephalitis meningitis scarring tissue brains worker class globally told worry go back work. 

Even poorer people realise risk in, choice either live everyday panic, or, remain stoic. thousands turn millions?? didn’t get gastric bypass. lap band placed. especially like parts:

- ""We know [!] populations eventually reach herd immunity""
- ""The results [of lockdowns, ...] include [...] worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings""
- ""As immunity builds population, risk infection – including vulnerable – falls""

r/nottheonion Risk vs reward. eyes, lips surgically attached CiC's butt today surely rewarding risk virus. Either they'll live rewarded King sacrifice they'll die good days behind them. probably top 10 worst ever - globally. 

But Bush Jun. really better. 

There big problem America almighty Constitution. mean dude encouraged New Yorkers keep going theaters, museums, restaurants, etc, saturate healthcare system, thus creating world's second major hotspot (bar China) Northern Italy? Really good point. Going need close indoor dining, bars, gyms. ""Limited energy excuse""

Okay, I'll wish EDS/POTS/CP/depression makes bedridden sometimes away. Thank you. Come again. Lol they’re caring anymore. don’t even half ass it.

The actual Dolphins subreddit seems pretty this, Reddit bubble. I’m sure plenty fans love this. feel like 2 types people went this, ones don’t think COVID big deal ones convinced White House taking proper precautions really didn’t worry.

You would guess, regardless optics, everyone stepped foot White House would getting tested daily. mean it’s something President could die you’d think someone would care enough force issue. goes show sociopathic admin is. even national health emergency, top scientist health officials disposal, believe they’re immune consequence.

I wish believed karma, ever time GOP could undone willful ignorance would right now. pretend got bit tick texas allergic /s don’t think it’s conspiracy theory all. numbers real. deaths real. deaths likely underreported 50k

But I’m challenging post made zero sense states never reported recoveries accurately whole pandemic. conspiracy behind that. fact cases deaths reported quite uniformly recovers barely even reported states all. Unless think people go covid year still sick.

So going sit tell 50% people got covid California got last two weeks still actively infectious. going say numbers world meters flat wrong it’s conspiracy, it’s poor reporting bc people don’t care tracking recoveries like deaths cases

But y’all want look incorrect awful data use make points that’s y’all also say follow science that’s literally least scientific thing anyone could 4 years murdering someone? plenty people forced answer among them. spread anti-mask misinformation, allow spread, follow blame. Seems like issue states failing report recoveries.

They usually happen once, pretty infrequently. 

Look [this Hawaii. 25 September, huge chunk people still sick. 26 September, moved like half recovered, once. enforce masks, cancel large indoor events, try prevent many infections reasonably can. It’s complicated. None severe outcome then. friend mine part leadership conservative synagogue.

They live services months. live stream congregation post social media, should.

They want keep membership alive healthy.  (And certainly political conservatives; conservative Judaism reference practices faith right-wing.)

Guys like norm.  need apologize.

These extremist fruitcakes exception.  Every major faith them. time Darwin Bowl. Learn cock magic? even legal? patient. Spanish flu epidemic lasted two years. COVID going US seven months. China actually proves Gai make difference. then... it’s true? I’m confused

Edit: nvm I’m dumb/can’t read.. got figures back up? likely, however, trial organizers discouraged use antibody testing many people change behaviour due beliefs immunity might skew data.

The amazing thing actually bother spend time lies nobody cares say. mean.. Generally people go think ""I'm healthy amd even get infected I'll fine"", never consider even that's true could still infect others. tell they'll jst say ""Ok"" move on. bigges portion people bars does, indeed, care abot others. Hyperventilating. Thanks reminder. might time give one looksie again. I’m fine that. suggest ""spendable"" (expendable). think entirely different thing good comparison. 50% get protected vaccines IFR lower flu. 50% would bloody massive help, means go 10% population immunity 50%. could re-open much country take many risks.

Everything together though, need everything get including still using masks keep R number down. Hope sarcasm. Florida 720,117 cases 14,766 deaths. 

On October 8th 10.8% Covid tests came back positive. stadium seating capacity 88,548. could expect 9,563 people Covid positive considering student age group high percentage asymptomatic people shedding virus. 


Florida: 2,222 new cases/day 720,125 total cases. Fucking brilliant /s didn’t make backstory, read remarks.

Hey bud, disagreeing someone. One side evidently wrong, spreading misinformation, leading loss many lives. 

Personally, I'm hoping misled people die, framing simple disagreement like ""what's best flavor pie"" bullshit. Word yeah agree there. think type argument still helpful put perspective though agree, apples oranges. fucking idiots spouted wrong ass stats early initial wave. age 65 total hospitalization rate around 10%. looking 20% around 10% working people. maybe 2% working people? 

Moreover suspect ""one fifth"" figure probably apply equally across age ranges, increases exponentially age like COVID symptoms, likely even 2%. 

You math more. Oh, say like life? you’re experiencing life introvert service public-facing role. sucks. humans amazing adaptation able better other. Man, hope happens. want BS go back normal lives! see would difficult. already well-established supply chains medicine. would distribute vaccine distribution centers major pharmacy chains. happens every year flu shot anyway. course would bit bigger, see reason done.

Hygiene theater: Spraying disinfectant indiscriminately place ward virus know primarily spread person person. mostly show, actually effectiveness.  forgot popcorn sunglasses Mueller investigation supposed smoking gun. Mueller investigation basically like ""hey job decide crime occurred. report based years investigation hundreds hours interviews dozen top lawyers working report. mean crime occurred, job""

If Mueller direct, I'm pretty sure Trump would impeached. Mueller basically left Republican controlled Senate decide, that's Trump impeach. IMO.   Guess faking breathing difficulty, better send home Swedish authorities actively discouraged people wearing face masks, said would spread panic,

This. lie. FHM refused mandate wearing masks. spreading panic never reason. reason cited mandating masks worry overshadow important measures like distancing hygiene. 

Not mandating thing discouraging. said masks used situations cannot avoided distancing imposible, caution much better everything avoid situations alltogether.

If people stop distancing masks spread increase. Like mask mandate countries. Masks much less protection distancing. two, see there, nice fucking problem powerful person country downplaying it. called hoax, says it’s flu, KNOWING it’s far worse since February least. course people get fucking confused it.

you also reading numbers wrong where. first paragraph says 1940s 10/100k died flu 0.5/100k 100 suggesting. teacher America, standards supposed teach start story Ho Chi Minh declaring independence '45, briefly covers ""French Indochina War"" ramp American involvement. 

I also tie back discuss involvement Middle East, many Vietminh aided fight Japanese WW2 would leading forces us Vietnam War, kinda similar trained Afghans fight Soviets. Factory farming better include soya corn wheat biodiversity bad rest. Nope course did.  
Typical people like you.  


Claim something absured, defeated logic reasoning, delete comment call mob justice. Based. fairly apparent point relying heavily frequent testing protect outside infection. mean, worked NBA, may lot outside contamination meetings guys Washington participating in. Lots flights, hotels, trips home, etc. course not.

My point kind people would inclined go hunting offset rising cost meat raiding bald eagle nests something, there's plenty deer, boar, raccoon, duck, etc actually *need* hunted due lack natural predators. came vent this.

Fuck fuck fuck. voters must feel real good right now. No, I’m reaching natural conclusion BBC, Guardian, Telegraph Financial Times. survey mainly covered Western developed countries hardly 'global'.

I think China got low marks many angry Westerners mad Coronavirus ruined jobs daily life, denial First World economies healthcare save them.

The Western nations already furious China Hong Kong, Xinjiang, early stages handling outbreak. Also add frequent (not untrue exaggerated) news reports faulty Chinese products, dog meat festivals, rude Chinese tourists etc. years powderkeg accumulated became lit Covid BOOOOOOM, Scapegoat! everyone Fuckchinafuckchinafuckchina 

It take many years, like maybe 5 years minimum China's standing West returns relatively normal levels

TLDR Emotions Beliefs rules opinions Fuck world. Would love see usa, china europe burn, raped pillaged country many times, time suffer remember 80/90s HIV/AIDS relatively new? People believed disease gay men drug users. wealthy think COVID-19 disease poor minorities. Sadly, that’s Republican Party heartless whole thing. certainly mean something. 

220,000 0.06% population. 

So means families, friends, colleagues 0.06% us affected. last Tuesday (Sept. 29), struggling breathe took University Utah,” wrote Facebook post Oct. 2 addressed Gov. Gary Herbert, “and sent home almost capacity, one better patients Covid. sit watch mom home oxygen tank ... struggle breathe, can’t help (but) think government dropped ball playing well I, know masks help prevent COVID-19. you, elected job requires decisions people don’t like, somewhat dropped ball. leader, Mr Herbert. Make decision require masks. live great state amazing people part legacy depends COVID-19.” way hell would allow US citizens country get numbers control.

Thankfully policies like you. Many countries open U.S months, seen significant increase infections Sounds like normal people paid things cost cost produce safely/humanely instead slashing prices around cost Iceland rising island too. could easily lockdown would temporary. Iceland really isolated Europe. mean, surprising kids die Viruses, every year 100+ kids die Influenze, year covid killed around 100 kids. Sorry, misspelled ""tax fraud criminal activity"". normally scroll see something agree FB, endangers people. wake deja vu hellscape except work spare bedroom. that's positive Trump this?

sounds weak fuck say believes four times deadly? Usually either far liberal far right, there's least sort train thought follow, kernel Truth. really understand train thought flu deadlier

Is thing people comorbidities died? (Which bs, example someone 50s diabetes deathbed written off) makes sense. 330M people US, took 0.1% serious side effects, would still 330k people. 

You want cure worse disease. Unless soulless president cares reelection, guess.  bad aren’t re-election, others, like McConnell, almost guaranteed win. Maybe person running win surprise victory. hope, guess. Yeah right. keeping total infections (which seem bit high) doubling reported deaths (actual deaths could still even higher) 4-6 people bad (as long everyone COVID-negative course). I'd problem 10+ people wearing masks. Especially can't trust family smart it... see there. would likely upholding election results would getting past election (and won) continuing screw people never passing second package promised. feeling civil war / United States mistake. big, dysfunctional, like empire equivalent size. burn out.

... remember south wanted slaves kind necessitating intervention, sigh. many US deaths six months WWII? BOOYAH! Yes. Spirometry show even people without respiratory conditions experience loss lung function age, people already dealing damaged lungs due respiratory illness loss post covid could mean longer able maintain current activity levels depend supplemental oxygen rest lives. pick fights might get blocked get blocked join one court cases trying say he's allowed block anyone sure you’re getting downvoted. You’re telling truth. know it’s lot ask people 20 seconds investigation see something’s true not. higher standard Europe using started regulatory review Pfizer vaccine today believe. don’t travel White House. work area going in. Actually I’m 12 year old girl Ukraine Didn’t stock markets drop today Trump said he’ll hold second stimulus package hostage election? WTF think serious long-term repercussions, however.

There strong sense (at least Britain, probably elsewhere), coronavirus become yesterday's news moving new thing. lot people openly declared fighting virus less important protesting (even though protests Europe would absolutely zero effect US policy), anyone said protest virus risk actually racist ignored silenced.

That undermined fight virus.

Even though protests Europe mostly finished now, suspect damage caused never fully healed. Covid-deniers gained huge amount ammunition allowed argue virus politics worry it. also equals combined civilian death Hiroshima Nagasaki Predominantly left-leaning website users downvote right-leaning comment. 11. California announced review potential vaccines, trust CDC anymore. Nah, I'm definitely going continue wearing flu/cold season even post COVID inoculations I'm feeling sick.  Asiatic nations definitely ahead us front.  I'm hoping year normalized seeing someone mask especially sick. long cold winter ahead us. People already breaking point.

At least summer outside.

It pleasant outside March. dealt winter covid yet. could tolerate events people would wear masks properly. Properly meaning covering nose mouth completely. None nose stuff, hanging ear like it’s ward effective proximity certainly covering chin only.


People can’t get right. done whatever want. don’t trust people right thing haven’t done right thing date. Should’ve specified age group, bad. around 10,000 died COVID 50. Old people die, happens. One day old die. Maybe sooner knows lol. don’t underlying conditions COVID really isn’t something worried yet even knows take covid seriously opposed to...?? significant risk contracting covid complications vs growing socially awkward? 

Or parents, worth quitting job send daycare vs. risking exposure keeping two incomes?

That math different everyone, depending live. 

Where Massachusetts, example, there's around 600 reported cases day entire state 6.83 million people moment. Even actual number active infections 10x number, that's around .1% population Covid given day. 

So daughter passes 1,000 people store, odds effectively 100% one Covid. store 30 people it, there's 3% chance one active Covid infection. definitely risk, one mitigated considerably mask usage among able. 

Mask wearing near universal area state. lowers risk infection around 85% (so let's call 50% due user error/refusal comply mask regulations)

So, worth risk take daughter grocery store? right now, answer no. absolutely see answer ""yes."" 

Taking kid grocery shopping name socialization definitely something think many people would recommend right now, choose families. small indoor playdates winter families practice social distancing contexts? quick pop local coffee shop wave barista help stave ""stranger danger?"" risks think lot families taking children, necessarily think they're wrong take calculated risks name social development. administration shows signs making long term plans.

That’s honestly what’s bad Trump Administration’s handling Covid, possibly even anti-masking nonsense (because, honestly, people probably forced wear masks places matter even aren’t happy it).

They’re saying “time open learn live it” without real methodology.

There absolutely way full year current situation economically sustainable general public business sectors reliant large groups without huge adjustments.

There huge federal task force coming long-term practical solutions productive living virus.

They designing practical techniques make person person interaction safe situations.

What fuck happened contract tracing? Sure I’ve got phone it’s opt-in guarantee nobody’s using it. Every government controlling Covid effectively using (and doesn’t and/or feel authoritarian).

It’s like, problem administration isn’t *directly* fact it’s incompetent ignorant. It’s side effects ignorant: it’s fact they’ve entirely *missed point* deliberately repeatedly, even assume sincerely trying.

A perfect example whole Supreme Court superspread party. White House thought fucking tested lot would mean don’t need masks precautions. Again: missing point. *rapid* rapid test referring fast get results back. doesn’t mean you’ll get positive result soon you’re contagious.

Their fucking CDC knows it’s sufficient.

And could easily exact party really easy modifications: 100% masks bit distance chairs. hugging, touching. Really hard! I’ve definitely seen countries created pods people outdoor concert think that’s great idea (with addition masks). think regular faces making incredible music. Excess deaths pretty steady 1.4x tested deaths US. keep mind excess deaths reported day death, covid reporting lags multiple weeks behind. also stroke 1919 wife, Edith, ran show. controlled communicated with, read, disseminated (?) decisions, etc. There's also part loop middle lots US Citizens others world wide get big, big smile faces Trump's delusional world crumbles.

I like part lot. Almost deaths bothered counting even shorter window. 5-ish months maybe. course do, WH want accurate count COVID-19 cases caused #CriminalGOP behavior conservatives would never allow secession though. need someone dominate control, primary psychological motivator. Yes people carry still nothing mitigate really baffles me."
